"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/recommended/27000/","jocosity","Communist "Joseph Ballin" Layton","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/","920 products in account","I'm really not a big fan of Tale of Tales, having played previous games like The Graveyard and that game with the deer, and now The Path. It's not because of their not-so-subtle pretentiousness, such as how when talking about the development of Sunset (their latest game, which I haven't played), they stated "Abandoning some of our more extreme artistic ambitions actually made work easier and more enjoyable. And that’s when we should have realized that we were on the wrong path. Because whatever we enjoy is never, ever, what the gaming masses enjoy." It's not because after Sunset became a commercial failure and they left the gaming industry, they proceeded to write a series of passive-aggressive statements on various mediums blaming Sunset's failure on the gaming community's inability to "get" it, along with a tweet that goes, and I quote, "Hahaha. I'm so free. Look at me. I can say ♥♥♥♥ GAMES! ♥♥♥♥ GAMERS! ♥♥♥♥ THE GAME INDUSTRY! DIE! DIE!DIE! And rot in hell!" It's not because in Michaël Samyn's Patreon, he has a $5,000 tier listed "Shut me up", claiming that "if you really want me to disappear from videogames altogether, stop writing about them but also stop trying to make them, basically get the f out of your precious hobby, all it takes is a bit of cash. Make my day!". Tale of Tales is a pretentious blowhard of a developer, and while any developer leaving the industry is a bad thing, I can't say I'll miss them. But none of those are the reason why.\n\nThe reason I don't like Tale of Tales because they don't seem to have a clear grasp on what gaming is as an artistic medium. None of their games are good in the tratitional sense, and instead they bank on their artistic value. The problem is, their games never seem to actually acknowledge the strengths of the medium. Video games are a unique artistic medium because they allow the player to interact with the story and characters in ways that no other medium can easily do, and that allows them to give unique, involving, and emotional experiences that you can't get in other mediums. Tale of Tales games are more like paintings made into video games; they're pretty to look at, and maybe you can find a meaning if you look hard enough, but there's very little to actually see or do in them, and they don't really engage the player any more than going to an art museum would. Rather than being "games as art", these games are more like "art as games", and while I'm sure some people will appreciate them, they just aren't very fun to play at all, and I'm not so sure that they even wanted them to be fun. The Path is a game where you pick one of six girls and walk around a forest (or stay on the path, but you're pretty clearly not supposed to considering 98% of what little game there is is off the path), stopping occasionally to look at things, and that's basically it. You get to Grandma's house, and then you start over with another girl. It has a great atmosphere, and the forest environments are pretty to look at for the time it was released, but that's about as far as the game goes as far as what I can compliment.","July 21, 2015","false","3.5"," 131 of 174 people (75%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","75","131","174","8","13"

If I had to narrow it down as to why that is, it would be due to the extremely mature themes and musical dissonance, combined with the exploration of the forest. Each item you find is unique to the character you play and, upon discovery, your character will interact with the object and an image will be superimposed over the screen, as if it were a memory.\n\nThere are six characters in all, each with their own unique locations and encounters with the wolf. Once your encounter with the wolf has been made you are left on the path, in the pouring rain, heading for your grandmother's house one last time. Upon arrival your character experiences their final nightmare and you are returned to the home screen to choose the next playable character.\n\nThe music and sound design is what becomes most dissonant in The Path. The off-tune choir of girls singing, mixed with an assortment of synths playing to heavy chains clanking in the background. It's all very unsettling.\n\nThe Path focuses on very serious themes without directly implying what has happened. If you find the topics of ♥♥♥♥ and child abuse horrifying then I advise you not to play this game. Nothing explicit is shown, it is merely suggested. It is up to you to put the pieces together.","November 25, 2013","true","5.8"," 67 of 87 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","67","87","2","0"

Walk there, and the game for that girl ends.\n\nOf course, that's not where the real gameplay is. Instead, go into the forest. A strange girl clad in white tries to guide you further away from the path, and strange white distortion on the edge of your screen guides your character to other spots. You can pick up flowers along the way (which do nothing but increase a counter -- really, you don't get a thing for picking them all up) and also find strange items. Some of these can be interacted with, many cannot as they are meant for another sister.\nEach item you can interact with gets added to the basket.\n\nEventually you will find the Wolf. The Wolf takes on a form which is meaningful to the sister you're playing as, and leads her to her death. These deaths range from the obvious (little girl gets eaten) to  the vaguely implied (talent agent destroys her? Woodsman rapes her?) -- a lot of this is left to interpretation.\n\nAfter each wolf encounter the girl is back on the path, but the only way to go is move forward -- slowly, limping -- to grandmother's house. If you picked up the right items along the way the house becomes a kind of horror slideshow with distorted graphics and sounds reminiscent of what you found in the forest...\n\nIt is a strange and unique game definitely worth playing. Just don't think you'll fully understand all of it.\n\nAlso of note is that the game's demo is actually a fully separate "level", where you play as the Girl in White in a very different form of the forest. Fortunately it can be installed even if you own The Path.","July 11, 2015","true","24.3"," 55 of 70 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","55","70","3","2"

I honestly dont think this should be classified as a horror game. But yolo whatever.\nANYWAY,\nIf you expect: A good story, pretty music, solid characters, spooky settings and something that keeps you guessing, this is the game.\nIf you expect: Jump scares, ghosts, a straight foward story, a challenge and being a wolf and eating little girls, this is NOT the game.\nI love The Path and support it with all of my heart. But this should not of been a video game.It should of been more of maybe an interactive comic, or even a book. Even so, this is great all around. Not great as a video game but great as a story. It is very powerful. There is a lot of different ways you could take the story and it still make sense and be…well, a good story. So if you haven’t noticed by now,\nITS A REALLY GOOD STORY. There is still a spooky atmosphere and sometimes you might catch yourself sitting there for a moment and thinking, “That is creepy wow okay” but never should you feel threatened or scared by anything that happens. Each girl (there is 6) experiences life in a different light. Which is beautiful. Now something that I want to say about the description of the game:\n\n"There is one rule in the game. And it needs to be broken.”\nThis rule is; stay on the path. For new comers, my suggestion is (If you have the time) play your first round of the game staying on the path right to grandmothers house. And think about the things you see there as each sister. Then, after you have went to grandmothers house as every girl, replay the game and immediately leave the path to then find your own way around.\n\n"There is one goal. And when you attain it, you die. “\nEach girls ‘death' is not as straight forward as the other. For me, some of the girls ‘deaths’ don’t seem like dying at all, but more of realizing something important in their life. (Some are obvious deaths though) Also, You do not get to see the girls die, you get to see what happens right before their deaths, if they die at all.\n\nThats all I really have to say, but by all means, I love this game and it is wonderful.\nSome tips and fun things to try out:\nThe flowers you find show you the map once in a while, so when lost, look for flowers.\nThe path disappears if you stay off it too long.\nThe “girl in white”s  intentions are different with each girl.\nThere is only one way to die so do not be afraid.\nDont base the game on the demo.\nAll of the sisters names are a type of red which I thought was cool.\nThere is a saving option in the pause menu, (Its not obvious and I kinda didn’t figure it out until my 4th play through so I thought this tip would help.)","June 19, 2014","true","16.2"," 44 of 60 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","44","60","2","1"

If you stay on the path the game ends once you've reached grandmother's house, so it's best to go and explore the woods. In the woods you will find things like gravestones, campfires, humans or notes, most of them trigger some kind of interaction but are not essential for completing the game (as stated before).\n\nThe Path is a game you play when you want to forget real life for a bit and just want to enter a strange but beautiful fantasy world.\n\nI would recommend this game over other 'art' games like Proteus, everyone who's into these kind of games should try this one.","October 28, 2014","true","3.3"," 31 of 41 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","31","41","2","0"

This game is obviously not for everyone. I know Steam is in no way related to Ps3, but if you know “Journey” the game or have played it and liked it then this is a lot like that. A really relaxing game when you don’t want a challenge, but something to reflect on. This is more for people who like artsy games. Some people call it pretentious and that’s fine to have that opinion. I personally have poured hours into this after long days and like to discover the symbolism and weave my own story with the pieces I find. There is really a lot you can figure out or imagine if you are into characters and stories.\nBasically this purely explorative. Just walk, run, look and observe. That’s all there is to it. Some people find this too basic, but I think there should be both complex and simple games out there. If you don’t like easy stories and easy games- then don’t get this. But if you’re like me and love a little exploration than this is for you. My only problem? The camera sometimes gets a little wonky when I’m observing. But it isn’t every time and it’s not like you’re going to be in one place for long. This game is otherwise beautiful!\nThe game will tell you to stay on the path. But here is the moral of the story; if you take the road where everything is paved out for you, then you don’t earn any experiences and you don’t learn anything about life. Everything is too safe and you will never know real life. Going off the path leads you to both good and bad experiences. The story is going for a bit of a darker theme and some people might think it’s too dark, but I think you can interpret it as something a little bit less so. I don’t really want to get into spoiler territory, but I’ll just say this; death in these types of games doesn’t always literally mean death, but death to a part of a character’s personality or how they look at life. The real objective is to find each of the girls their own “wolf” which symbolizes different things. These wolves are the main even that will change their lives for better or worse. You decide. There are plenty of people who have come up with awesome theories. And that’s part of the fun!\n","November 4, 2015","true","6.6"," 25 of 31 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","25","31","0","0"

It's easy to get lost at the start when you don't know how the game functions yet and it's hard to get all the items without a bit too much aimless wandering. But it has a reasonably well thought out story and great atmosphere. Some of the girls have more engaging and well written stories than others though which is especially noticeable in the ending sequences. This leads to some of the endings feeling significantly more fulfilling than others. At first I thought it was going to be more grim than it turned out to be due to the girl I started with and if you don't collect enough of the items the ending sequences make less and less sense.\n\nIf you enjoy games that are very relaxed and mostly involve exploration you'll like this one. If you don't then you'll likely find it boring. Especially since running in the game makes it so that the environment phases out which makes it almost impossible to search for anything unless you're walking.

Playing The Path is like reading a book: there is no voice-acting, you have to read the thoughts of the six main characters to understand who they are and the nature of their desires and fears. Sometimes, it is like playing a record: the eerie, yet beautiful soundtrack plays a decisive role in setting the atmosphere of the game. The Path is not a traditional horror game: it plays with the player's sensitivity. I personally had to close the game once because I was just afraid. Afraid of the paradox that the Path presents us: if we take the safe path and  go to grandmother's house unharmed, nothing happens (even though the grandmother is quite terrifying in my opinion, but this is not relevant here). To 'beat' the game, we have to encounter the wolf. Its form is always different, sometimes surprising. It completes and ends the girl's path, and helps us understand her better. I am currently replaying the game to better understand what happens and sharpen my interpretations.\n\nThe music, the graphics, plus the work on the shading, blended with the subtle characterization of Robin, Rose, Ginger, Ruby, Carmen and Scarlet, bring into being a wonderful game.

I enjoyed it myself, so I'll give it a recommendation on that part, but I can see why people hate on it as well.\n\nSo, talking about what people might not like about it first to get that out of the way. The game is very slow and often feels as if it doesn't have a set goal, until you find out what the set goal is that is. And up until then you have no real purpose in the game, and for all purposes up until the point when you realize what's happening in the game, it's just an exploration collectathon game.\n\nNow onto what I did like about.\n\nPeople keep on bringing up Five Nights at Freddy's when ever they talk about good hidden stories. I want those people to spend a few extra dollars on this game as it is a lot less waiting and a lot more gameplay than FIve Nights at Freddy's. The story is hidden is such a way that you have to complete the game %100, meaning collecting every memory, to get the full thing, otherwise the game can honestly be quite confusing to be honest. But if you put enough effort into finding everything in game the it's worth it in my opinion.\n\nGoing onto the music in this game. It's like they took a page right out of "Silent Hill" and crossed it with "The Binding of Issac". Needless to say, I loved the music in this game. It provides a good amount of atmosphere while also allowing you to feel the safety you should while safely in Grandmother's House, assuming you did like I did and just walked down the path on your first playthrough. The music is eerie when it needs to be and calming during the majority of exploration, with sound effects mixed in to keep you on your toes.\n\nNow for the characters. Having the old story of Little Red Riding Hood protrayed in this sense was really interesting to see. Even though only one character even slightly resembles the fairy tale character (Robin), it still allows for each character to have the same story of misplaced trust and betrayal, which was what the original Grimm fairy tale was about. This is another aspect of the game that you can't experience in it's whole unless you play the game to 100% completetion. It adds replayablity for somebody like me and adds to the overall charm of the characters.

But The Path seriously pushed me to my limits of tolerance on this front. It's a game that is very obviously trying too hard, and lets its own mechanics get in the way of whatever point it's trying to make. Be warned, if you're going to give this one a chance at all, go play it yourself and come back because I'm going to spoil the hell out of it. I'm sure it's even less effective if you know what to expect.\n\nYou pick one of six girls fresh from Hot Topic to visit their grandmother in the woods. The game tells you up front to stay on the path, and here it commits possibly its greatest sin. My first time through I made the slow walk straight down the path to a surprisingly sinister house. Inside the pitch-black cottage the girl made her way to her corpse-like grandmother and laid down next to her. The game then informed me that I had found no items, unlocked no rooms, not encountered the wolf, and that I had failed.\n\nSo, to reiterate, the game told me to do a thing, I did the thing, and then it told me I failed.\n\nYOU CAN'T DO THAT YOU ♥♥♥♥S. If subversion of authority is a theme of your game then you need to introduce it in some way within the body of the game! I'm not going to read your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed treatise on your store page to figure out how to play your game. Fine, whatever, I picked another girl and walked straight off the path. The lighting and sound get creepy until you run across some random point of interest in the woods, like a theater stage or sofa or TV or pond. There are items to collect like knives and two-headed teddy bears. I met a little ballerina girl who spouted some nonsense about chaos and led me back to the path. After a whole bunch of exploring I went back to grandma's house. I got treated to a slightly different path through the rooms and then another screen that said I failed.\n\nAt this point I gave up trying to figure out what the game wants. Wandering the woods is interesting for a bit, but hamstrung by the glacial speed at which you move and the horrible sketchy-artsy filters the game vomits all over your view. There's really no common theme or identifiable symbolism to the junk you find, either. It's just weird for the sake of being weird. Or maybe it isn't... the store page says the optimal experience is to play for 6 hours. There are something like 13 items to collect and another 144 flowers you can pick, but I doubt very much I'm going to divine The Path's true meaning if I keep at it.\n\nAppropriating the creepy side of Red Riding Hood isn't a bad idea for a game, but this one gets so caught up in trying to be clever and poignant that it all falls completely flat. Maybe there's something to find in here, but it's too damn boring and obtuse to get at it.","September 15, 2015","false","0.6"," 43 of 80 people (54%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","54","43","80","5","0"

With The Path, that is surprisingly hard to answer.\n\n"Yes" if you are the type of gamer that likes something different from everything else you've played, won't let technical flaws distract you from immersing yourself in a well developed game world and enjoy stories with a dark side.\n\n"No" if you have a short attention span that demands action be part of all gaming, tend to call things "pretentious" that others call "artsy", can't stand to be limited to an all female cast of playable characters or don't have a penchant for the macabre.\n\nLet me be more specific. My biggest complaint with this game is that it is clunky. It doesn't control well and your character will occasionally get hung up on things. Fortunately I never got permanently stuck, but there were several times that had me holding my breath. Aside from that, the slow pacing left me tapping my foot at times. Each character moves at a different speed which, in my opinion, doesn't add anything positive to the game. It just makes playing all of the slower characters less enjoyable. There are also certain locations where the ability to run is disabled. For that reason alone I found myself trying to avoid these locations even though otherwise they were often the most interesting places.\n\nWith all that said, don't count The Path out yet. Its atmosphere is one to get lost in. The art style fits well and is altered heavily at times throughout the game to help heighten the feeling they are going for. The music perfectly matches what's going on and is hauntingly memorable. The stories told in this non-linear open world format are engrossing, if a bit too steeped in symbolism for my taste.\n\nOverall, it feels like the type of first game an independent developer would put out: Rough around the edges but a bright eyed, inspired piece of art that isn't afraid to test the boundaries of what a video game is.","February 1, 2014","true","5.4"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","9","15","0","0"

Disgusting and revolting, pretentious piece of crap. And no, I don't think I'm missing "the point" of the "game". I regret spending money on it, and if it were possible, I'd give anti-money to its creators (I'd give 20 $ so that they can lose 20 $).\n\nWhat's the gameplay and the setting? Basically you walk through a boring, endless forest with disgusting colour palette, terrible graphical filters and scratched words with illegible annoying font going across the screen for no reason. There are a couple of cut-scenes that can be triggered in the forest, there's a metaphor for taking risks in life (straying from the path that leads little red riding hood to granny's house), and a metaphor for how life rapes you in the end no matter what you do.\n\nI felt dirty after playing this, I wanted to take a shower multiple times, it was such a disgusting experience. No gameplay, no meaningful story (except for some lousy metaphors I mentioned above), ugly, unpleasant to the senses on a very visceral level, nauseating, pretentious, artsy-fartsy, irrational, waste of time. I even wonder if I should write this review - it may attract attention and make people wonder "is it really that bad", thus making them give money to the creators of this abomination and losing hours of their life on something that cannot be unseen.\n\nGuys, make no mistake, I like indie games, dark games, depressing games, I like intelligent sophisticated games with a message and unique ideas or perspective.

If you're looking for jumpscares, don't buy this game. But if you're looking for subtle tension, thoughtful and ambiguous themes, implied and frankly somewhat disturbing horror, and beautiful art, buy this game. It's an atmospheric game, and the developers create the atmosphere perfectly. Oh and if you're afraid of thinking, this game isn't for you.\n\nYou begin in an apartment where you can pick one of six sisters. Each sister has different items you can interact with in the forest/a different wolf (not a literal wolf except in the case of the youngest sister, Robin). Each encounter could be interpreted many different ways. Personally I think that it's a loss of innocence story. Each girl meets something that they must face as they move into adulthood. The wolf is the most important part of the story. Once you reach the end of a girl's story, you will be told "success" or "failure" based upon whether or not you met the wolf (meeting the wolf=success). You also get a rating based upon how many of the girl's individual items/secret rooms you found.\n\nI've played for an hour and that's enough time to meet the wolf with two girls and collect about half of their items. However, you can spend hours in this game if you have enough patience. There are tons of different disturbing endings you can get based on which items you collect.\n\nDo note that the game is not "complete" until you've found the wolf which each sister (by leaving the path) and then walk the path with the girl who presumably represents childhood innocence. Then the game restarts and you can try again with a girl you've already found a wolf with.\n\nOverall it's not a fun game. It's a thinking and patience game that tells its story with beautiful art and excellent atmosphere. It's a great work and easily worth $10.","October 16, 2015","true","1.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The Path is what many would call an artistic game in the most extreme sense.\n\nMost people's first reaction, mine included, was being confused as to what the goal or purpose of the title was.\n\nYou play as one of six young girls at various ages in an imitation of the tale "Little Red Riding Hood". The first instructions you receive is to "stay on the path" on your way to grandma's house. This you quickly come to find is a ruse. Remaining on the path brings you swiftly to your end destination and a game ending. The real goal, if it can be called that, is to collect 144 flowers as well as stumble across objects and areas of the game which trigger memories. Each girl has their own look, locations and encounter with the wolf which is about the only variety that is present.\n\nThe primary themes are of violence, sexual abuse and child abuse. This of course is not shown directly, or even indirectly, but very subtle with much of the events being left to our own interpretation.\n\nI can safely say I was highly disappointed in this and hoped it would be the best out of the horror bundle it was a part of.

It claims to have all sorts of narrative aspects, but frankly, unless you read over the store description for the game, it's clear as mud, because there's no actual real narrative within the game. You basically spend the game wandering around until you find a cut scene, and you can only find one cut scene per playthrough. The speed at which your character traverses the world is excruciating, and if you try to move faster by running, you get punished because the camera moves into an angle making it impossible to see where you're going.\n\nThe game description goes on about how this is such a mature game with themes unsuitable for children -- frankly, the original tale of Red Riding Hood is miles scarier than this. Mostly it's more confusing than scary.\n\nIt'll take you several hours if you want to actually find all the stuff in the game, and most of that time will be spent rather repetitively recovering the same ground you've already covered. I can think of more entertaining ways to waste my time than slowly meandering through the same stuff over and over again.\n\nThe music is also annoyingly repetitive.

It has great atmosphere and the graphics aren't bad and the gameplay itself is creative and thought-provoking.  But straight up, if you don't like games that have an inconsistent story that gives you no answers, The Path isn't for you.  If you like games that make you think...The Path probably still isn't for you.\n\nTale of Tales as a developer has completely imploded their own fanbase with their behavior lately, yes, and it's really made me reconsider this game.  Originally I thought a lot of thought went into this game; the developers established Livejournal accounts for the characters, there are a lot of details in the game, the girls all have some sort of personality and it seems like there's a mysterious story unfolding behind all this.\n\nIt sure SEEMS that way.\n\nBut the thing is, if you set up a mystery that no one else can solve and then insist that they don't "get it" because it's ABOUT not solving the mystery, but about "appreciating" the "puzzle as it was left unsolved," then that sort of makes you sound deep and mysterious yourself.  It sort of shifts the focus from the creation and onto the creator, the only person who has any answers about the otherwise completely unintelligible piece of work.  And frankly, after their freakout, Tale of Tales definitely sounds like a duo way more interested in shifting attention onto themselves.\n\nAnd I was really committed to putting together the puzzle of The Path once.  I pulled apart the girls' Livejournals and was really baffled that their situation seemed to indicate that The Path was an experience they had...all the time?  Regularly?  And that their mother insisted they only go on the path itself by themselves??  It started to seem like the developers were not interested in creating some macabre version of hell or surreal depiction of time, but had set up characters they could pretty much do whatever they pleased with, as long as that gave them attention.\n\nHonestly, if you set up a game to seem all deep and mysterious with individual sad stories to piece together, but then roleplay your characters as just whatever, it sorrrrta seems like you actually got nothing to say.\n\nI didn't want to believe this was the case before, but after seeing their attitude about the failure of their game Sunset, their interest in only having a small (elite) fanbase, and their total disregard for making their games accessible to people, I just don't think the people behind Tale of Tales possess the sympathy and depth to create a game that demonstrates sympathy and depth.\n\nIt was a huge disappointment.\n\nThe Path is not deep.  The Path does not have secret answers or an underlying meaning.  The Path is just a very creative atmosphere, all dressed up with nowhere to go.  If you get something out of it, it'll be inspiration for some better story.","November 30, 2015","false","13.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You're told to stay on the path and avoid the wolf, but if you do what you're told, you don't get to experience anything this game has to offer.\n\nThe Path is a mystery that needs to be unraveled. As you explore, you find more things and learn more about each of the girls, and you may bump into the "wolf". For each of the girls, meeting the wolf is a life-changing experience.\n\nThe game is a very interesting mystery and an engaging metaphor, but when held to the normal standards for a video game, The Path is severely lacking. The controls are completely awful. The aesthetic is nice, but the actual graphic quality is pretty poor. The sound is odd, which is fitting for this game. The gameplay is slow. Really, really slow. You'll need a lot of patience.\n\nThe game description on Steam should be taken seriously. This game is not for children.\n\nThe Path is definitely not for everyone. Pick it up if an arthouse title with difficult metaphors interests you, but if you're looking for a fun game, this is not it. $10 is probably a bit much; wait for it to go on sale.","June 30, 2013","true","5.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Not truely a game, but not enough of an indie classic to be called "art"; to me it stands on its own as a psychological examination of life and what it means to mature from childhood to adulthood for the six sisters of this thriller/horror interactive piece.\n\nYou have one objective: get to grandma's and do not leave the path. But you have no choice but to leave the path to truely experience this game.\n\nThis is NOT a game for people who do not have patience. There is a hell of a lot of backtracking and blind searching as you uncover the clues of the characters, their habits, personalities and innocence. A completionist run for a single character can easily take away three hours while you listen to the same eerie music over and over, challenging your mental memory and the occassional flashes of the trail you've left behind while getting hopelessly lost in the forest.\n\nCompared to a similar indie "art" game, To The Moon, this interactive title is certainly very similar in the amount of love that the development team put into this piece. But unfortunately the message isn't as clear as it could have been without being a completionist or cheating and hitting GameFAQs for a plot synapsis.\n\nAs an art deco title, it's a game that must be played at least once in your life. English Literature and Psychology Majors will get a real kick out of this title, as well people with an interest in slow-paced thriller and horror games. But other than that recommendation, think really hard before you purchase this title if it isn't on sale: it is a difficult one to recommend to casual and mainstream gamers.\n\nI lean on the said of "yes" because I really appreciate these types of games.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sue77/recommended/27000/","Sue77","Sue","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sue77/","186 products in account","It’s a few years since I first came across The Path, by Tale of Tales but, on re-entering the fictional world of the sisters, I find the game has lost none of its appeal.  Originally released in 2009 and loosely based around Red Riding Hood, The Path was intended as a different kind of video game with an emphasis on partaking in a narrative, rather than being structured around quests and conquests.  However, I feel there is an element of strategy involved as the player is graded according to how many objects they find, how many of the secret rooms they unlock in Grandma’s house.\n\nGame play is deceptively simple.  You give a basket to one of the sisters and they leave home with instructions to follow the path to Grandma’s house.  The whole point of the game is not to do this, to wander through the forest where you interact with various items, collect flowers and objects.  As each sister meanders through the dense woodland, there are items and places specifically for her.  However, the player commences with no idea of what to look for, so there is a great emphasis on exploration.  In my opinion, much of the game is about unlocking the personalities of the sisters.  They are all different, although the stylisation and method through which we unravel this is systematic.\n\nEach sister can meet her nemesis during her travels, but the guise of the wolf is different for every individual.  When these situations occur the player can only watch as the scenario unfolds.  After this event, the girl is transported to Grandma’s house and her journey through this domain depends upon what she has collected and encountered on her travels through the forest.  Here, each sister is upon a path pre-determined by her previous actions.\n\nThe Path can be described as a psychological game with a distinct horror edge, however I would argue there is more to the game than just this.  For instance, there is a definite attempt to blur the boundary between fine art and the video game.  One only has to watch the leafy tendrils growing around the games title as each sister begins her journey, to experience the surrealist arrangement of Grandma’s house and the cubist demise of each sister.  In addition, the music is haunting and the sound effects well judged.  One aspect of the game which I feel encompasses the horror element is what happens if the player causes a sister to run.  This is especially effective in a darkened room with the sound up.\n\nThe Path is a game to experience at your leisure.  It is a much slower paced game than any other I’ve encountered, but as the emphasis is on participating in each sister’s journey, the pacing works well – this isn’t a game to be rushed, its one to lose yourself in.\n","January 11, 2014","true","10.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Inspired by the tale of Red Riding Hood, it does stick with the basic story quite well. There are different characters that you can play as, and they all have their own wolf that they eventually come face-to-face with while travelling to Grandma's House. The graphics are not as great as many of the more modern games that there are, but the special effects are lovely, and give the game an overall horror-esque vibe to it. The various characters that you can select from are all unique in their personality and how they interact with the items in the woods, and make the game to play through multiple times to see their ending.  The gameplay is simple, but make it so that you can enjoy the game all the more.

It's not what some would consider a "game", but more of a story shrouded by symbolism and is incredibly artsy. If you hate games that are almost purely story driven and more of an experience, then you might want to look elsewhere.\n\nFor a person like me, The Path is just the type of thing I love. Not only is there dark and mature themes, but the symbolism is absolutely brilliant if you notice them. I also enjoyed the "Red Riding Hood" theme the game had going for it. After replaying a few times and discussing the story with others, I realized the game is actually very open for a lot of interpretation. More so than I anticipated. The ideas that many have come up with have only enriched the experience for me.\n\nBasically, you have several sisters, each very different from each other, and their goal is to get to grandmothers house to deliver some goods. The rule is to not stray from the path, but it has to be broken in order for the girls to encounter the wolf. If you do not want to be spoiled or have my opinion on the wolves and their interpretation with each girl, please skip the next paragraph.\n\nIn my opinion, each girl represents a stage of life. The wolves are an experience that one must go through to grow up. These experiences may be harmful or scarring, but like in the game, the girls get up, wounded, and make their way back to grandma's house. The whole story is about growing up. Letting your curiousity getting the better of you, getting wounded, but growing up a little. The path is a safe life without exploration. There is no harm, but neither do you learn anything. That is why you get a failure screen when you do not encounter the wolf.\n\nAs for it's length, if you just buzz through the main task at hand, it is very short and you also miss a lot of added story. Each girl has items and unlockables. There is also 144 "flower coins" to collect if you so chose. In my opinion, the replay value only lasts as long as there is something that you missed, which just to note that the forest is randomly generated each time so finding everything will be a challange if you switch girls or start over. Unless you are the type that enjoys resetting the game and starting fresh repeatedly, you probably will complete the game once and rarely touch it again.","December 16, 2013","true","6.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I watched a friend play through one of the girl's story line, and I thought Id love it since Im a sucker for a game with a story with a message. There isnt much "game" to it though. You play as one of a bunch of girls, wandering in a forest until you meet her "wolf"/how she loses innocence. The game only tells you to stay on the path, which of course, you can do, or you can wander off. The game doesnt explain that the real goal is to collect flowers and find objects that trigger memories of the girl you are currently playing, so my first playthrough, I just ran through until I found the "wolf", and was then disappointed with how shallow the event seemed, and confused why the character I was playing was so effected by the event (the theater story comes to mind, and I still have no idea why it effected her or why I should care, as cruel as that sounds).\n\nThe controls are pretty basic. W and shift to run, or use your mouse. But if you play in windowed, the mouse isnt locked to the screen and gets annoying very quickly. Music is repetitive, but isnt bad. Graphics are pretty nice and I liked the aesthetic of the game quite a bit.\n\nMy real problem with this game, and why I cant recommend it though, is that it lacks clarity of your goal. If you dont go find flowers or hunt for objects, you wont trigger memories and you wont learn anything about the character you are playing. Its very hard to feel much of anything for a character when you have no context of that character. And if you arent very attached to the characters, then the message the developer is trying to convey gets lost beyond a very basic "lost innocence" concept.\n\nSomeone in another review suggested that this game be called "interactive digital art", and I would have to agree. If you go into this looking at it as a piece of interactive art, Im sure most people would enjoy it, but if you go into this looking for a game, you are probably going to be disappointed.","June 23, 2015","false","8.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

And it's not. If you want a capital-G Game, look elsewhere. But does that need to be a criticism?\n\nWhat is it, then, if not a game? It's an experiential marvel. The only game I've ever seen with more atmosphere than The Path is the similarly un-game-like Dear Esther. While the theme of Little Red Riding Hood is so incredibly overdone in interactive storytelling circles (though few have made it to commercial release), The Path has an interesting enough take on it to be worthwhile. The characterisation is superb, although you have to search for it and even then it's expressed in a very minimal fashion. Each of the girls is likeable but flawed, and, without wanting to spoil too much, each one is ultimately undone by her flaw. While not a game in the ludic sense, interactivity does play a vital part of the experience, creating a sense of "discovering" the story and also creating emotional resonance by making the player complicit in sealing the girls' fates.\n\nThe negative sides of the game are that sometimes atmosphere takes precedence over technical considerations. Sometimes the text that's communicating the story is illegible because it doesn't contrast strongly enough with the background, and sometimes the game just gets too dark to see what's going on, which I guess is supposed to be scary, but just ends up being frustrating.\n\nI can't recommend this without qualification, because it's not for everyone. Indeed, that's one of its strongest points! If you're interested in something that isn't quite a "game" in the traditional sense, are willing to put effort into engaging with it rather than having everything neatly presented to you, and your narrative sensibilities tend toward feeling rather than thinking, it's definitely worth a look.","January 12, 2014","true","4.1"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","1"

A modern, gothic take on the classic Red Riding Hood Tale that articulates the dark cautionary elements quite well in subtle ways.\n\nThe game has but one objective: Go to grandmother's. Upon doing so, this means you've somehow lost the game, so as it turns out, you are actually encouraged to disobey the rules, and adventure into the dark, dreary forest, interacting with objects in the woods, skipping freely, getting completely lost. Eventually, you, as one of six 'Red' girls, will find what represents the Wolf, in one of it's various incarnations.\nUpon meeting the wolf, you are taken back to the path, completely desolate and somber as you tread quietly to grandmother's in the rain. There, grandmother's house is no longer a sweet old lady's cottage but an absolute mind-♥♥♥♥ where you die, but you technically succeed in the game.\n\nWhile the game is completely open to interpretation, and is more art-focused, this reward of defeat, especially after a character has been presumably injured, molested, or otherwise attacked, raises a few questions, considering rather than being able to outsmart the wolf, once you are locked into the animation, there is no way of fighting back. You essentially play 6 victims. Again, this is more of an artistic form of story telling, but it still raises a few questions.\n\nOverall, visually, the game is appropriately sharp and goregous with a bit of an aesthetic to intice gamer-cult followings, and the soundtrack is fascinating and at times intensley dark. With so many themes and theories out there, this is a game for anyone who's looking for a different gaming experience, or for someone starting out in indie gaming. Or, simply for anyone into either gothic things or fairy tales.","December 21, 2013","true","9.1"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

The Path is something unique, and it is definitely not for everyone. If you excel at abstract thinking and extrapolation, and can be patient, this game is for you. This game cannot be hurried, and encourages you to think, and move away from the "Sprinting with all guns a-blazing" tropes that are so prevalent. Some think it's meant to be a 'horror' game, but are disappointed when it does not fit their expectations. It is thoroughly disturbing and sometimes gut-wrenchingly sad, but only if you understand the characters and can take subtle hints.

Most of the game is about finding things and trying to understand what they mean. I don't want to go into spoilers, but suffice to say that most findings in this game are not clear cut and each person will interpret what is going on in the story more or less differently from the others.\n\nThe disturbing element in this game is that the main protagonists are kids, and bad things happen in the story. Some people relativise that by interpreting things on a second level, and this game is certeinly open to interpretation and taking things as symbols instead of literally, but suffise to say that it is not for everyone.\n\nA fairly original game, and one of those that the more time you spend in it the more you discover. You can do a 10-20 hours a playthrough, start another, and see things you never saw before as it relies on interactions, you can get different results depending on who does what and when.

It was far too cryptic and slow paced for me and as another reviewer already stated cryptic doesn't necessarily mean deep.\n\nMy first playthrough I went straight to Grandmothers house and lost the game, then I played two of the other girls and wandered off the path and through the various stories/ collecting the random shiny things and eventually suceeded. I thought the ending nightmares were vague and cryptic and leave too much up for interpretation.\n\nInitially I was intrigued by this game, but I stopped halfway through the third girls path because I felt it was getting repetitive and was simply a case of collect said objects, watch a random cut scene alluding to the said girls life, collect shiny things, have a unique encounter, end up back on the road and watch the ending nightmare.\n\nThis isn't a horror game nor is it a free roam sandbox game.The game is surprisingly linear it just lets you wander around for a while then the girl in white comes to lead you if you get lost, some of the imagery was interesting but I wouldn't pay full price for this title (Obtained it as part of a discounted Indie bundle).

As usual with Tale of Tales, you're not going to run around and be rewarded with an achievement everytime you poke something (call it a walking simulator if you must). And like Sunset and The Graveyard (other ToT games I've played), The Path may not have strong graphics but its aesthetic is incredibly strong.\nEach girl has a story and a personality you can get glimpses of as she comments on what she sees; and as you lead her through the forest, she meets her "wolf" - which is where you can go wild with theories. After that, she ends up in a bizarre, Lynch-like version of grandmother's house...and disappears.\nLet's be clear: if you expect the game to clearly state what happens and why (and I like that type of games too!), you're not going to be happy. The Path expects you to find something in the imagery and girls' fate that resonates with you, and work with it.

Players are originally instructed to stay on the path on the way there. Upon reaching grandmother's house, players are treated with an eerily empty house, a mysterious rocking chair, and a pale old woman in bed with a stuffed wolf lingering nearby. Or, should they stray off the path, they encounter objects that inspire their chosen character to relive unpleasant memories. Gather enough of these memories and your character will encounter the dreaded wolf.\n\nUnfortunately, what could have been an intriguing exploration game with a unique underlying concept is rendered more trouble than its worth by poorly designed gameplay. Each character you play as seems to move slower than the last, causing the game to suffer from terribly boring stretches of walking that seem to be taking you no where. The forest has very few noticeable landmarks or interesting sites to discover. I often found myself walking for long stretches of time, encountering absolutely nothing of interest. On top of the drearily slow pacing, the moment you start to feel like you're moving a little bit faster the camera swings to an inhospitable angle.\n\nOverall, the Path has a pleasantly creepy vibe to it. The music is often discordant and mixed with child-like singing and chanting. The air is foggy and the forest is dark. The hallways of the grandmother's house are large and imposing and there's a sense of foreboding whether you stay on the path or adventure off of it.

Players are originally instructed to stay on the path on the way there. Upon reaching grandmother's house, players are treated with an eerily empty house, a mysterious rocking chair, and a pale old woman in bed with a stuffed wolf lingering nearby. Or, should they stray off the path, they encounter objects that inspire their chosen character to relive unpleasant memories. Gather enough of these memories and your character will encounter the dreaded wolf.\n\nUnfortunately, what could have been an intriguing exploration game with a unique underlying concept is rendered more trouble than its worth by poorly designed gameplay. Each character you play as seems to move slower than the last, causing the game to suffer from terribly boring stretches of walking that seem to be taking you no where. The forest has very few noticeable landmarks or interesting sites to discover. I often found myself walking for long stretches of time, encountering absolutely nothing of interest. On top of the drearily slow pacing, the moment you start to feel like you're moving a little bit faster the camera swings to an inhospitable angle.\n\nOverall, the Path has a pleasantly creepy vibe to it. The music is often discordant and mixed with child-like singing and chanting. The air is foggy and the forest is dark. The hallways of the grandmother's house are large and imposing and there's a sense of foreboding whether you stay on the path or adventure off of it. The memories you find are unnerving and just a little bit haunting. In terms of atmosphere, the Path is a clear winner. However, the poor controls make even turning your character clumsy and awkward.

In order to interact, you release the forward key. Gamers who are easily put off by a slow-pace, lack of action, and/or lower end graphics, I suggest you stop reading now, and shop elsewhere on Steam. However if you're a fan of exploration, experimentation, and a psychological approach on the horror genre, then by all means, keep reading.\n\nThis is in fact a horror game, despite the lack of actual jump scares or a monster chasing you. The Path is unique that instead- you're chasing the monster. Play one of the six sisters who is tasked to bring your sick grandmather some wine and bread, but by all means, don't stray off the path- or so, as the game warns you. Despite the game's warning, you won't be rewarded unless you go on the path less travelled and go in search of the sister's wolf, unique to her. To avoid spoilers, I will break down the experience without actually delving into the story outside of;\n\nThere's little to no voice acting. There's limited reading as each sister makes a remark on each object you do come across, as well as meeting her wolf. This minilmalist approach helps you get into the mindset of the sister, and what personality drives her to her decisions. Once meeting the wolf and finally arriving to grandmother's house are you treated with discovering the consequences of growing up and a bookend to that sister's story. Much like a silent film noted and influenced with a mix of an independent arthouse and a creepy horror film, enough is left unsaid to allow the players attempt to connect the pieces together. This leads to deep discussions creating webs around the game of everyone's different but meaningful and personal experiences.\n\nThe Path is ultimately unique, memorable, and gorgeous in concept and haunting in it's hidden messages. This game is not for everyone, but for those who've fond memories of finding an old book to dust off to read of the dark fairy tales of once ago. This game is for those who can handle strong adult themes that can unrattle those sensitive to graphic truths of the real world. I bought this game the first year it came out, and even today I find myself going back to it. Well worth my money, and time, over and over again.","July 3, 2014","true","2.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The Path is about the inevitable human curiosity, the obliteration of one's innocence, and the consequences that follow.

And yet, although it's been years since I played it, I still think about the wonky little experience once in a while. In many ways, it's extremely obnoxious, the droning lady choir if you find something to pick up, the sluggish walking speed, and that's not even getting into the dark side of the Path. That very dark side, that Little Red Riding Hood horror schtick that leads to some frankly disturbing and often outright tasteless imagery. Nothing's gorily graphic, but nothing leaves much to the imagination either. Both practically and thematically, you are leading these girls to their dooms when you leave the path, but if you don't leave the path, they haven't ~lived~ or something. Anyway. It's by turns heavy-handed and nasty, the writing is more curlycue artsy-fartsy than terribly meaningful, and yet, and yet, and yet. There are some touches. I like the oil-painting darkness of the woods, some of the more surrealistic elements, the cramped breath if you do try to sprint, and our little lady of hope, who lives off the path, but doesn't court its dangers.

A unique take on the Red Riding Hood tale, you choose one of several young girls and are instructed to head to your grandmother's house without deviating from the established path in the forest. However, such things are never so simple.\n\nIf you like, you're welcome to obey the rules and keep to the safety of the titular Path. That's not where anything interesting happens, however. By diverting into the woods, each girl has a chance of finding a series of reminders that illuminate their past, some of which are more traumatic than others. As there are several Red Riding Hoods, so are there multiple Big Bad Wolves, all of whom intervene in a given Red's life in their own unique ways. By the way, let me add a trigger warning for what I think was an implied sexual assault in one of the stories.\n\nThe forest, its few inhabitants, the relics there, and the experiences following your discoveries upon your eventual arrival at grandma's are all beautifully rendered, and accompanied by a haunting, if limited in variety, soundtrack. The Path's decision to eschew dialogue for visual cues and symbolism helps get your imagination going, but at the same time makes certain sections more unclear than they ought to be. Even though the game quickly grew on me, even I had a few bouts of frustration between getting lost or being unsure what to do at certain points. Still, I enjoyed all the room left for interpretation with all the scenarios, and am still on the fence as to whether all the Reds are their own entities, if they're aspects of the same person (as they spread across a range of ages), or if they're something else entirely.\n\nThe Path is definitely a game with rather niche appeal, but if you're willing to let yourself get lost in a world for a bit, several times over, I'd say it's worth a look.","January 10","true","10.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

No jumpscares just a constant feeling of dread deep down inside. I'm a huge Silent Hill fan and it did not dissapoint and I just played through the first girl.

Some of the art on the screen, the music (to some extent), and the concept are, well, nice. But the character models and the pacing leave quite a bit to be desired. The slooooow pace through the forest is the result of 1) an effort to comb through it looking for relevant objects/memory cues, 2) the rather random appearance of a map, which would be much more helpful for combing the forest more effectively, and 3) the bumpy walk/run mechanic, where you suddenly hit an invisible edge (of pools or memory glades) and have to maneuvre around. Unlike a game like _Gone Home_, I feel like this game is slow not because I want to stop and absorb the atmosphere or detail, but because the game is holding me back. Often it leaves me wondering what I should do - do I hit a button? Am I at the edge of the map, and should turn around?\n\nIn the end, I'm not sure what to do with this game. Is it a fairy story? Maybe. But too slow to use in the classroom: I'd feel bad asking someone to have to play this. It has a good heart, but not very useful.\n\n4/10","May 30, 2015","false","0.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's probably overdue, but I'll review it in anycase.\n\nI found out about this game from a (now dead) manga-zine called Skip Beat. I had just started my interest in horror games and this was classified as a horror genre game. It also had my other love; intriguing character and story development that is left almost entirely to the player to translate based on their own experiences and feelings.\n\nRose Efrinose, a youtube lets player, introduced it to me in a way that I finally decided to go ahead and pay for the game. I believe this is one of those very rare moments that I paid full price for the game because it interested me so. I have collected all the flowers and seen all the different scenes and collected all the items in the basket and even now I cannot say with concrete surity what exactly happened to any of these girls.\n\n...but it definately works your brain to consider it.\n\nWhile the graphics are not HDTV, they are whimsical and dark and appropriate, making the experience just as entertaining today as it was eight years ago when I first started playing.","February 1","true","274.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The setting is a journey to your grandmother's house by 6 young girls who are told to "follow the path" while the endless forest on the sides taunts you in. Each female protagonist, at different stages of puberty, get to explore and find specific objects and areas that trigger memories and thoughts while collecting 144 flowers.\n\nThe entire exploration experience is a premise to encounter a unique metaphoric wolf or demon, that transforms the girls and throws them at gates of the fabled grandma's house, where a nightmarish sequence seals each chapter. From a narrative perspective, the experience builds upon your personal interpretation of each encounter and memory, and it is deciphered in your own mind rather than being explicit and direct. The atmosphere is tense but lacks the immediate feel of dread, while using music and sound effects to control the experience. If you run for too long, the gathering flowers disappear and the music becomes intense and foreboding, and if you arrive at set piece your are forced to walk, and so forth.\n\nThe graphics are serviceable, with unique character designs and attention to minor details; a good example is the receding city scape in the opening, or how the the path disappears once you delve deeper into the forest. Each character gets its own set of animation for all movements and interactions, and the music albeit repetitive, does contribute to the atmosphere giving hints to special encounters and sets.\n\nThe Path does require a personal emotional investment, something that many will forfeit. If you are willing to go through it, do not expect a satisfying resolution or an ending, as the journey is the game, there are no achievements or victories once the girls' paths are explored. 3/5","November 3, 2013","true","21.2"," 18 of 38 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","18","38","0","0"

I had no idea what I was doing or why I was doing it.  I couldn't reliably get my character to run, and when she did, the camera just pans up so you can't see anything.  She would randomly interact with various things without me pressing any buttons or simply stop moving and refuse to go any further until I spun the camera around a few times trying to walk in every possible direction.  The controls on this game almost made me shut it off more than once.  It's infuriating.\n\nApparently, I unlocked 3 out of 3 rooms, found the wolf, and discovered the mystical lake.  I got a "B" rating for playing.  Fantastic.  When the game told me I found the wolf, I was completely surprised. I remember no wolf, nor any wolf-like things besides paws going across the screen (but the game was shooting random crap across the screen the whole hour I was playing).  In fact, I had no idea I had finished the game until it told me.  I just thought this was another random encounter thing that was happening.\n\nI will completely admit I don't understand the point of this game.  Positive reviews say it's more of an art piece than a game -- ok, I get that.  I played "Gone Home" and "Shelter" and I understand that those are supposed to be artsy as well.  Except, they have a freaking point and they let the player figure that out.  This game does not.  It tells you to stay on the path, except if you do, that's how you "lose" at the game.  The only way I figured out the point was to come back on steam and read about what the game is supposed to be about.  I feel that playing a game should tell you what' it's about and you shouldn't have to read forums to decipher the meaning.\n\nI will NOT be playing through with the other girls to pick up more junk from the forest or to attempt an "A" rating.

After they'd all 'finished' the resulting mess was collected and stored in a jar. Once the contents of the jar had been left to fester for a suitable amount of time they were emptied out and released in the form of this (not a) game.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I like the indie, artistic, 'story driven' genre and have fully enjoyed games like Gone Home and other similar titles, but what this consists of is around, at best, 10-15 minutes worth of a surreal animated short film split into small pieces. It controlls how often you get to see these set pieces by forcing you to continualy walk around in the belief that you're in control of an absurdly thin layer of interactivity and by making you repeat the process 6 times.\n\nIf this isn't either a masterclass in trolling the fanatics of this type of game or an attempt to subvert the genre, it's certainly an excercise in extreme artistical masturbation and anyone stating how "wonderfully atmospheric", "fantastically understated" or how much of an experience this (not a) game is, is just as much a of pretentious, pseudo-intelectual idiot as the developers if this is indeed a genuine, non-spoof/satirical attempt at furthering the genre.","July 2, 2014","false","4.1"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","29","2","7","2","0"

It is an interesting jumble of snippets from semi-related events.  The story, to me, felt more like seeing the shadow of an event, and being unsure what it really was.  What does it mean?  I believe this obscure feeling is quite intended, and is the main drive of playing the game.\n\nWhat this game fails at (miserably):\nBeing a game.  The game doesn't just make you walk slowly around.  It makes you walk SLOWLY around.  Too slow!\n\nIt would be different if the graphics and music were a cool experience.  But they just aren't.  It's rather ugly.  The best part of the graphics are the scrawls and doodles that pop up on the screen, kind of like after seeing a bright light for a second.  But the trees, the characters, the ground... they all just look terrible.  If the game is working so hard to be artistic, they really need to consider the visual and auditory effect they are getting across.  Although, I understand that art can be whatever it wants to be... but I don't believe they were capable of improving the visuals.  If they were producing photorealistic scenery in other games, and then they decided to shoot specifically for this ugly style, then I'd say they made a bad choice, but accept their choice.  However, ToT has basically proven that they are not visual artists in the realm of 3D graphics.  Perhaps a case could be made for the color choices being well done, but it feels like such a small victory when one girl's buttcrack is a line awkwardly drawn on the back of her character.......\n\nThe sound was closer to getting across an effect, but I think they just didn't know how to get the effect across quite right.","September 27, 2014","false","0.6"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

It's interesting, but it's definitely not worth $10. Catch if it goes on sale for a dollar or two if it interests you.\n\nThe problem is that there is hardly enough actual gameplay to qualify it as a game. The only thing you can do in The Path is walk or run. The video makes it look like you're interacting with items, while you're actually just watching the characters do the interacting. Seriously, the way you pick up an object is by releasing the "walk" key and standing still so the girl can go on to interact with whatever you've stopped her near.\n\nI get that Tale of Tales was trying to tell us a story in an original way, but they don't seem to have an understanding of the importance of immersion. I probably would have loved the game if I actually felt like I was controlling the characters and discovering the secrets of the forest with them, but instead the game just left me feeling disconnected. When you finally do reach grandmother's house, your "reward" is an agonizingly slow walk and some flickering, jumpy cutscenes. Some of the sisters endings didn't even make sense, even with 100% level completion. People may try to gloss that over by saying it's "artsy" or "deep," but in reality it's just bad writing and poor design.","June 14, 2014","false","1.3"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

The path is best defined an indie game that appeal to hipsters. I played for ~10 hours and I still don’t have a single slightest clue how this is a game. It’s just graphical remake of the original little red riding hood. You find collectibles, and landmarks, and end up with a different ending depending on your success at finding things. Depending on what the hell you found, you can get ♥♥♥♥♥, beaten up, or both at the same time. In terms of visuals, this game is fantastic in that department. The colors definitely bring out the eeriness of the game. Sadly that is the only thing I can find that is even remotely good about this game. You spend hours running in a ♥♥♥♥ing forest, for a 30 second ending. Just go read the original little red riding hood, or go watch all the endings on youtube. Maybe play through the game once to see the rather magnificent forest.

Its very high-art but in a horror setting... based on the *original* story of Little Red Riding Hood (LRRH) with some interesting inferences to Catcher in the Rye (CiTR) this game is <<NOT FOR CHILDREN>>.\n\nIf you're familiar with LRRH or CiTR - and if you are okay with a game with SLOW progression and a subjective scoring method... and if you're the kind of person that can fill in the gaps and analyze into a story - this game is for you.\n\nIn retrospect Its been YEARS since I read LRRH or CiTR so I had to borrow someone else's notes online about this game.

There is some glitches here and there that could have been repalable, but they still don't make game unplayable.\nAll in all; beautiful craphigs, music, meaning and interesting idea makes this game one of my favorite indie games ever!

But there's more to it than that. You have the option, if you so choose, to go wandering off into the woods. There, you can meet various people or objects from your childhood.\n\nI think this is a game about loss of innocence and people being forced to grow up. It's certainly open to interpretation.\n\n"The Path" is not intended as a game in the traditional sense, but the creators have thrown in a couple of optional "gamey" elements to pacify people, such as a map, or the option to collect flowers in the woods. There is also the option to try and find all the relevant objects for each girl. But there are no rewards for doing so, as that is not the point of the game.\n\nUnfortunately as this game was made by an outside studio, the creators have no way to compile it for Linux, which is a great shame.","March 15, 2015","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

From one character to another, you'll probably revisit the same places.

For the storyline of the game, besides the small amount that is given, most of the girl's past memories are given to you as a room and an item, and from then on you have to form your own theory as to what you think happened and what resulted from what and what makes this girl this girl.\nEach girl is very different from each other and some people can relate to more than others, and in some ways I am able to think and reflect as to how I would handle situations such as these and how to avoid some as well.\nNow, to stop my rambling, I'd totally reccomend this game to people who like forming theories and exploring and games that are very artistic, dark, and abstract. For those who usually don't play dark games unless it's Halloween, it's as well a good idea to play for that reason as well!

You walk around the forest finding objects that give you memories, but the cryptic and fragmented memories don't really you that much about the girl  or her life. Each of the girl's has a wolf that represents something negative that happened in her life but these simple stories aren't that interesting to me, except for maybe a couple of the more surreal ones like Rose or Ginger's stories (as opposed to the older girl's that are all about encounters with guys).\nThe only reason I chalked up 4.6 hours on this game was from playing it with my friend who likes anything girl power.\nBut for $10.99 it's not really a bad buy if you have some time to spare. The art is attractive and the mysterious atmosphere is a plus although the gameplay is a little annoying. But if you really want something weird with a girl as the protagonist I advise you to look into the famous Japanese translated rpgmaker horror games, like Ib, Mad Father, Misao, the Witches House and especially Yume Nikki. Those games may look simple but they have unforgettable stories and content and you won't find much that is more twisted and unusual.","June 8, 2015","false","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In terms of gameplay, while there isn't much to it - it basically fits into the "walking simulator" category though there is much more of a personalised feel than other walking simulators like Gome Home; after progressively playing as each of the sisters while walking through the forest, as I came across the landmarks that reveal significant events in the previous sisters' lives there was a sense of poignancy, reminding me of what shaped them. Also, it's very easy to miss some of the girls' events. The other gameplay "feature" if it can even be called that, is collecting glowing flowers but as it has no effect whatsoever (literally, at all), I think that's because I read somewhere it was a commentary on the prevalence of collecting things in videogames, and pointlessness of it, which is all a bit too hipster and postmodern for me but I'll forgive it as I love it so much.\n\nIt's atmospheric, dreamlike, at times creepy but most of all was magical for me. It's the first time, for a game, that I afterwards spent hours on the Path forums reading everyone's own interpretations of the events. The story is not given to you on a plate, and it's the wealth of different interpretations that I think make it truly worthy of being described as a piece of art.","March 24, 2015","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This starts when the game first begins and you watch an unskippable 30 second opening sequence (repeated every time you restart). After that it's similar to The Stanly Parable (tells you to do something while implying something else) except the world is huge and devoid of content. It took me 10 minutes to find the first memory and 30 more minutes to find the wolf. In between, you literally run through a forest for most of the game.\n\nBut even for a game about running through a forest it lacks. The controls are clunky. You can't look around using your mouse, the longer you sprint the worse your view gets, speed is painfully slow and turning is a nightmare. At certain points the camera angle changes and you become even worse off.\n\nBut then there's the story. It sucks. Each girl (this isn't told to you while playing) requires you to find a collection of memories and a wolf. The wolf represents a situation where the girl fell to temptation and lost their innocense. Memories and hidden rooms help you peice together how it happened. Its not obvious how you interact with some things (I've left wolves mid-sequence because I didn't know I was supposed to wait), and the stories are simple and boring (see tale of tales wiki to read them and save some time).","November 18, 2015","false","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Which is a shame, because they, and this, are often priced very well and are short and unique enough to give a few hours of thought and fun.\n\nHighlights\n* Not over marketed - It isn't a traditional horror game like Amnesia, and hasn't been marketed as such, bravo Tale of Tales\n* Really good sound and music design - an off-note girls choir is subtly haunting\n\nMistakes\n* The graphics are jagged and low-res, which has been adjusted for with the art style, but better graphics and resolution would have helped bring out more in this title\n* Invisible walls interrupt the immersion\n\nRecommendations\nPriced at £6.99/9.99€/$9.99 at the time of review. While undoubtedly cheap, the mere 3-5 hour play time makes it less valuable in terms of traditional playtime. At less than a buck on sale, it's most definitely worth checking out at -50% or less.\n\n* The Path is better to play the less you know about it\n* You can play a demo and pick up translation files for The Path on A Tale of Tales website[www.tale-of-tales.com]","May 31, 2015","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is also an element of horror in the game, that may be mild for horror fans, but for people who aren't will provide an extra layer of depth to the game. If it is possible, I would recommend getting the game and playing it without making any research about the game for the best experience.","June 28, 2015","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/banshee3c/recommended/27000/","banshee3c","Banshee3C","http://steamcommunity.com/id/banshee3c/","258 products in account","Highly recommended.\n\nThe Path tells the tale of Little Red Riding Hood, at various different ages. It is a coming of age story about women, and has underlying themes that are sexual and violent.\n\nA fable like Little Red Riding Hood seems straightforward, which is one reason we keep telling it. But why keep telling a simplistic story over and over again unless it has some meaning? The meaning, and other reason we still tell it, is that Little Red Riding Hood highlights the dangers of a girl's coming of age.\n\nPeople complain the Path can be completed by just walking forward. The game allows you to reach an end stage that way, if you want it to be that straightforward. But you can also spend more time learning about the story and the different little Red Riding Hoods (or stages of her life) if you want.  The freedom to finish the game on your own time is a good gameplay mechanic.\n\nThis was one of the first digital games I bought (not on Steam, initially), and so it also gets props for that.","June 28, 2015","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Olyth84/recommended/27000/","Olyth84","Olyth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Olyth84/","471 products in account","Right off the bat, I’ll say you as the player will either love this atmospheric exploration game or it’ll really wear on your patience fast. It can be mind-numbingly slow, confusing, and the controls are tolerable at best. There is almost no gameplay beyond exploration and collecting to speak of. Still I do recommend this game very highly to exploration lovers, role-players, and players with active imaginations. For these players I promise this game will have a lot of the things they enjoy in gaming.\n\nHonestly, while I do highly recommend this game as stated above for open-minded players and exploration lovers. Personally, I found this game initially to be rather boring and hard to get into. As I tend to play more direct story driven and action oriented games. Yet, I decided to give The Path the play time I needed to honestly judge it. Out of sheer determination fueled by the other good reviews. Which generally said the game would get better if given time. For which was true in my case. I slowly started to get into this game as my predetermined notions of what makes good gameplay faded with each step I took into the dark woods. I quickly realized this game almost requires at least an hour or two to really judge it. Due to the game’s slow placing and subtle influences.\n\nNone of the game’s story line is directly force upon the player and is instead left to them to find and figure-out. While, initial gameplay as stated above may leave the gamer lost and confused. Once they do discover their story oriented purpose in game, either through sheer luck or logical deduction. Story-driven events will start to playout more often for them and the story should start to become clearer in their mind. Leading to the player’s enjoyment level most likely increasing or at least I believe so. As in my case, once I got that ah-ha! moment I started enjoying myself.\n\nI have on purpose been rather vague with the details for those who do not like spoiler reviews so far. But for those who would like more to go off of. When deciding whether to give this interesting game a go or would like to just know more of what’s really going on in it. The follow two sections go into more descriptive detail. The first covers the gameplay elements and “generically” describes the goal of the game. The second further down one describes the games goal in-depth and does contains some direct story spoilers. Each section is tag with a warning label for those who rather avoid spoilers. If you choose to read on or not thank you very much for taking the time to read my review. - Olyth\n\n--- WARNING: Gameplay related spoilers below ---\n\n\n\nThis game is ulitmately very dark and twisted. From the start you’re given two important choices to make. One which is obvious: Which of the young ladies would you like to play? The other, which is subtly hinted at: Is your chosen maiden going to be a good girl by following the given directions to head straight to her grandmother’s house without deviation or is she going to venture off the beaten path and explore the dark woods?\n\nSo logic would dictate initially you of course would obediently follow the directions you’re given and go straight to grandma’s house without deviation, right? Oh, how obedience in this game is so overrated. All you’ll get for your goody-two-shoes effort is a whopping “D” rating as your character arrives to sit at the bedside of her dead-looking grandmother. While the words “FAILURE” is plastered across your screen. Before the game unceremoniously plops you back on the character selection screen. Yep, the game wants your little Miss to be a disobedient minor. If you hope to receive anything above a “D” rank and some acknowledged “SUCCESS!”\n\nNow if you’re girl does like to venture on the wild side and decides a little trip in the woods would be fun. Things are going to get a tad dark and atmospheric. As the game’s bright and cheery visuals turn quickly into a dark and eerie wooded locale with some lite horror elements introduced to set the mood. Also, to make things more interesting within mere seconds of leaving the path you’ll be completely lost and finding yourself walking in circles. Sounds like fun right? Well yes and somewhat no.\n\nWondering the woods lost is basically the initial core of the gameplay. As the girl explores she’ll come across random items and some limited interactions with other characters. Which is intended to give the player hints and imagery to build upon to develop their own personalize interpretation of the game’s story. Which not surprising will make the initial experience very confusing. Borderline leading to some to rage quit out of frustration and boredom.  As they will be most likely waiting for the game to give them a purpose or at least a goal to work towards. Something the player may gain either within a few minutes or may take upwards of an hour or two to figure out. If they stick around long enough. Depending on a little luck and a lot of patience.\n\nAfter the player finishes his or her first character’s playthrough in the woods, either by coming across a key event or staying lost and running out of time. The goal of the game kind of becomes clear to the player to a certain point. Which is to lead each girl one-by-one to their horrible demise. For which the player receives higher ratings depending on how many items they found and if they located the girl’s personal key event. I did say the game was dark and twisted.\n\n--- WARNING: Contains story related spoilers ---\n\n\n\n\nAs I mention above the player is rated on whether the player choices to collect items and if they find the girl’s personal key event. By Now I sure you've most likely figure out from the game visuals and the fact that the girrls all wear red. This game is based off the Red Riding Hood Fable. So the key event the player is ultimately looking for to get the best rating is to locate the other main character in the red-riding hood story besides Red and Grandma. The big bad wolf who wants to eat the young maiden. Pretty obvious huh, if you think about it. Yep, what you’re now thinking is correct: the player’s ultimate goal to get the best rating is to systematically hunt down the wolf and sacrifice their poor character to him. With each girl’s experience in the process being unique and the wolf being a little different for each of them. Due to girls being of different ages and having their own personalized perspective of the events as they encounter them.\n\nAs the player finds girl’s personalize beast, they get to watch some unique cut-scenes of Red's and the wolf's initial encounter. Some being more entertaining than others. Before being taken to just outside their grandma’s house and allowed to enter it. Although, this visit is not as visually cheery as the good girl’s visit. Each girl gets their own twisted nightmarish version of the house to briefly tour. Before the player is shown the girl’s fate in the form of multiple image stills depicting their gruesome death by the big teeth and claws of their wolf. Followed by the player receiving a chapter completion prompt with that “SUCCESS!” they were looking for and an overall ranking as describe above.\n\nAfterwards, the player is returned to the character screen to select their next victim. With the deceased girls no longer being present alluding to the horrors that befell them. Now what happens, when only a few girls are left or better yet; none…..? Is there something sinister going on behind the scenes. Maybe something to do with the memories and visions the girls saw. Well I going to leave that’s for the player to figure out; enjoy!

Ultimately a critique will have more to do with whether you liked it/whether it resonated with you/how it affected you, and that's not a review, that's a response.\n\nOn the other hand, a work of interactive fiction has some responsibilities that have nothing to do with its message. The Path has terrible, confusing controls. Some of the controls sometimes work and sometimes don't. Most places you walk by holding down W/up arrow/forward, but in one place you have to tap it repeatedly instead. You spend way too much time being forced to walk one ... mile ... an hour ... I understand drama, but the basic walk speed should have been about double what it is. The times you have to walk the last stretch to Grandma's house are agonizingly slow.\n\nThere's supposed to be an action button, but I generally was only able to interact with things by approaching them until a ghostly closeup appeared in the window, then taking my hand off the controls. Having actions happen when controls aren't being manipulated is TERRIBLE interface design.\n\nAnd then there are the location indicators along the outside of the screen. Given that most of the forest is empty, this is your primary means of locating the things you're looking for. But it doesn't respond quickly, it's hard to judge distances, and the map only pops up occasionally (!)\n\nI'm not going to even attempt to talk about The Path's artistic merits. But even if this were the world's most beautiful painting, you'd still be looking at it through a broken, filthy window from 300 feet away. The weakness of the interface makes the basic act of playing through the work tedious and unpleasant.\n\nI'd include a trigger warning for sexual violence imagery, but ... it's a freakin' Little Red Riding Hood game.
