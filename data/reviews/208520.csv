Great game, just not perfect but one can forgive the weak spots.\n\n\nLong Text:\n\nA fun little nich√© title that combines economy simulation with round-based combat in a meaningful way. By no means the most deep and realistic simulation of the Prohibition Era but it manages to capture the atmosphere through authentic, if sometimes comical, voice bits, great and fitting music and general flair.\n\n\nNeither combat nor economy sections of the game work perfectly but work seamlessly together but it can get repetetive.\n\n\nMulti-Player  is PvP (vs other players and their gangsters) and  2 Co-operative missions. You can only play the turn-based combat but you can build your gang out of the game's henchman list, level and equip them according to your preferences (and what you can afford).\n\n\n\nIt IS a fun game that draws you in with its charm, easy to use and understand controls and mechanics, quick action and original maps based on Atlantic City.\n\n\nIt is NOT a hardcore economy sim with deep layers of mechanics nor a high-tech combat simulator.\n\nYou are limited to the ingame ressources and will most likely figure out the most efficient way to play about midway through the 10-15 hour campaign and slight repetivity might sour your experience.","December 5, 2013","true","101.9"," 306 of 342 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","306","342","0","0"

Heck, I spent 30+ hours playing it, so you might think that's an implicit recommendation right there. But it's not.\n\nThere's enough going on in Omerta to keep you occupied in a pleasant, cow-clicker kind of way. But the strategic/RTS layer lacks enough depth to be really satisfying - every mission plays out in pretty much the same way, tilting from "how long do I have to wait until my next building? I hope I don't run out of money" over to "I'm printing money and the police are in my pocket" in about 10-15 minutes each time.\n\nThe tactical combat is pretty fun, but unlike XCOM EU, you don't feel like you're really making many interesting choices in the team construction. I've carefully balanced my squads between AoE shotgun-types and single-target pistol/rifleman. I've also just thrown a bunch of characters in with the best-rated weapons that happen to be in my inventory. Either way you'll find a way to win without too much sweat. So leveling up gang members and choosing their skills/perks becomes a forgettable side note, not the kind oi high-stakes, nailbiter moment it should.\n\nI picked up Omerta as part of a Humble Bundle so I'm plenty happy with the purchase. If I'd dropped north of $10 on this, though, I'd feel cheated. Omerta has some nice production values, but the gameplay is a lot more like a Facebook/casual game than a real AAA title.","September 16, 2014","false","33.2"," 112 of 126 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","112","126","0","0"

Each level is set in a different neighbourhood of Atlantic City. You have an overview of that neighbourhood where you can rent or buy buildings and establish illegal or legit businesses or joints.  There's also some squad based tactical combat where you control some of your hired gangsters as they fight rival gangs or cops.\n\nGood points:\n- the games style is pretty good with nice looking maps that pull of the 1920's look quite nicely. The music also adds nicely to the games atmosphere.\n-running your own mafia gang is pretty fun for the first few hours at least\n\nBad points:\n- this game gets very repetitive after a few levels. The basic formula for each level is start setting up businesses, discover more of the neighbourhood, set up more businesses, gather enough money, resources or liked rating to complete objectives, combat mission end. While the campaign has a story and objectives that try to keep things fresh is doesnt stop the repetition creeping in and the game becomes a chore.\n- the combat sections arent great. Granted its not the gameplays main focus but it doesnt have much depth and combat sections become more of a nuisance later in the game.\n\nI've ticked not recommended for this game instead of recommended  but it's really one of those "somewhere in the middle" games. It's not so much a bad game but it's not good either, just average. If the game sounds like something you'd enjoy it might be worth a try but probably not worth it otherwise.","November 7, 2015","false","20.3"," 88 of 100 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","88","100","3","0"

As a matter of fact, there is no point in building bunkers or base defences either, because the only time you will get attacked it will be scripted.\n\nAdditionally the multiplayer is a joke. It only allows you to do a small number of pre-created missions.

Omerta uses a turn-based combat systerm (like Heroes of Might Magic), combined with a free market economic environment (like Patrician, or any of the Impression city games) and has a "take over the world through back alley means" main goal (like Grand Theft Auto or Tropico). It begins with you making a "custom" character (you pick one of six portraits, his starting weapon and his stats). After that, your story picks up and you go from immigrant to booze king of New York during the Prohibition. Typical gameplay involves sending one of your six on hand gang members (all of which are preselected) to buy one of three main commodities in the game (beer, liquor or guns), steal any of the commodities, sell any of the commodities, establish a property that deals with any of these things, or just accumulates money. Every now and then, you will need to go into a combat mission, which involves you picking four (and only four) of your six gang members. Each character does have their own special weapons and talents (healing abilities, morale boosting abilities, etc.) and you get to plan out the assault/raid/assassination. Here are the reasons I didn't like this game: 1.) They don't let you customize the main character as much as, say, Baldur's Gate, nor do they let you make custom characters to bring into the game (like Freedom Force). 2.) the learning curve is horizontal until the very, VERY last mission. Then it becomes vertical. In other words, I ended up rage quitting over how easy and not challenging everything was after they decided to make the last mission 20x harder than the previous missions. 3.) You are given a multiplayer option that nobody uses (pay $40 for this game or nothing for TF2, Planetside, Dota 2, or Tribes: Ascend?). 4.) This game was very cheaply made, and that's coming from a guy who still will play Heroes of Might and Magic 4, Zeus: Master of Olympus and other cheaply made strategy games. There are spelling/ grammar errors everywhere, the jokes they make in this game are dumb and the voice acting quality leaves me wondering if the white guy sniper is actually black, or if the drunken irish doctor is actually Italian. 5.) There is absolutely no replay value and very restricted freedom in the game. After you beat the campaign (and the dlc, if you REALLY think that's a sound investment), you have an open sandbox mode (which isn't bad, to be fair) and the aforementioned multiplayer mode. Considering that Kalypso made this (yes, the people who made Tropico made this crap), I was disappointed with the fact that I couldn't just put a hit on random people (random buildings, yes, random people (Mike Hodges, etc) no). While Kalypso is doing everything to always add content and fix bugs, it simply isn't worth the price. For $40, buy XCOM or the newest Tropico. For $5.99 or less, go to GOG.com and you'll find several quality strategy games that trump this little thing.","December 5, 2013","false","36.4"," 90 of 115 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","90","115","0","0"

You have very nice voice-acting, awesome graphics (especially rain visuals on street is pretty damn good, I liked that), and... yeah, that's it.\n\nFor some reason I couldn't find more pros. It's a very simple mix of strategy and RPG, with turn-based combat. Gameplay is pretty damn boring, it takes some time in every mission to "settle up" and make a good income, only to discover that 5 minutes later mission is finished... And you start again...\n\nActually there's no real reason for "having fun" with doing anything apart from main storyline. The only things, which are permanent are the weapons, and most of them are useless anyway.\n\nI won't lie if I say that I had higher hopes for this title. I love Tropicos and got this game as a preorder special to Tropico 5, and decided that I can play it a bit before Tropico 5 arrives, but no. Game is unfortunately boring, repeatable, very short (you can finish it with collecting most of the achievements under 20 hours, on normal gameplay it's about 10-15 hours I'd say), and doesn't really offer ANYTHING, which could potentially hold me for a bit longer.\n\nSorry Kalypso, but Omerta isn't your strongest title. Adding more RPG elements like taking 1/10 or even less of daily income to the next mission would make it far more enjoyable. There's no real reason for making anything apart from storyline, and perhaps collecting some interesting weapons, but even this is pretty optional. I had higher hopes for this game and I was sure that it will be similar as with Tropico - I start playing and it forces me to finish every damn mission, only because it's that good game. In this case, I had to force myself to finish this game, and it's unlikely that I'll launch this game ever again.","May 2, 2014","false","47.4"," 75 of 93 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","75","93","0","4"

At the start of a new chapter you get to pick which map to play on by choosing a mission. Missions have different rewards attached to them such as a level-up for your henchmen, special weapons or an increase in team size. Then the game zooms in on the streets on the map and drops you into what could be considered to be the primary melting pot of the game‚Äôs many aspects; the strategic level.Here you rent and buy properties in which you can set up both legal and illegal businesses. Character creation is reminiscent of classic turn-based RPGs like Fallout or Baldur‚Äôs Gate, but in a mobster setting. Rather than just assign points to your attributes ‚Äî Muscle, Finesse, Smarts, Cunning, Guts, and Toughness ‚Äî you select four or so out of a dozen options that establish your character‚Äôs aptitudes.Omerta‚Äôs turn-based combat feels like the generic brand version of XCOM: Enemy Unknown, lacking any cinematic flair and seeming no more evolved than the turn-based strategy titles from the ‚Äô90s, with a cover system that feels ambiguous at best and arbitrary at worst. Sometimes you fight mobsters, sometimes you fight cops, and sometimes you fight KKK members, but there‚Äôs little nuance to be had in your approach to dealing with these foes. To Omerta‚Äôs credit, you can often skip combat with an ‚Äúauto-resolve‚Äù option.What Omerta does best is capture the charm of the 1920s, from the soundtrack‚Äôs smooth jazz tunes, to the accents of the colorful characters, to the aesthetics of period city districts and vehicles. Omerta even touches on the themes of racism and sexism, issues that plagued society in those days, without being offensive or irreverent, and without taking the easy way out by ignoring them altogether.Omerta is a great game which quite successfully mixes economic management with tactical turn based combat in a well-made mobster setting.","September 26, 2014","true","70.2"," 35 of 48 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","35","48","0","0"

The game is reminiscent of Gangsters 2 and Gangland, utilizing similar economic and battle mechanics, but lacking some of the depth and scope of the older games.\n\nThe gameplay is divided amongst "levels," neighborhoods of a city in which a specific mission must be accomplished to continue to the next. Most of the missions are relatively straightforward and do not require a great deal of strategy to accomplish. The battle mechanics are also somewhat clunky and unrealistic, and is by far the most challenging aspect of the game due to the limitations. When the mission is completed, the level ends abruptly without an option to continue building your empire in that neighborhood.\n\nSandbox mode offers more of a challenge, allowing you to set the police coverage to high and offering rival gangs that can quickly move in on your territory, take over your businesses, and attack your "hideout." The neighborhoods are rather small, however, and really restrict the scope this game could have.\n\nDespite the problems, however, this is the best organized crime strategy game that has hit the market since Gangland was released in 2004. It has been enjoyable for hours and I recommend purchasing it on sale.","December 13, 2014","true","6.9"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","18","20","0","0"

Currently action points and movement points are separate.  That means that there is really no such thing as a good defensive position, because sucidally aggressive AI who outnumber you on every mission 3-4 to one are going to run up and hit you with a pipe wrench from out of sight before you can stop them.  Even if they only get one hit, that's one foot into the grave for that guy.\n\nThe devs chose to greatly simplify tactics so there's not really any good overwatch, no defensive positions and the tactics are very sloppy unless the AI does super dumb stuff like stop in the doorway.\n\nAlso - and this is a minor gripe - the gaim's main enemy are KKK members.  I don't love the KKK any more than the next guy, but it feels stupid.  Since when is the KKK running around with submachine guns fighting the mafia?  I feel like this is a clumsy grab and making you feel like you're the good guy.\n\nFFS you're a gangster.

The graphics and music are really good.  The voice-acting is fairly decent.  Although the story is rather stereotypical, it isn't bad by any means.\n\nAbout the gameplay, I like to compare it to Xcom Enemy Unknown, because they both combine  a management game with turn-based combat missions.  Xcom EU won several prices last year, including strategy game of the year, and got generally high reviews.\n\nFrom what I heard, the reason Omerta got bad criticism was mostly due to bugs and the management aspect being fairly simple.  Funny enough, I feel the same applies easily to Xcom EU: base management is totally simplified compared to classic Xcom, and multiplayer is so bugged it's hardly playable.  The difference is Xcom patches only seemed to scratch the surface, while I've recently played a lot of Omerta and haven't encountered a single bug.\n\nAnd what about the turn-based combat ?  Well, I actually prefer Omerta, I really feel they did a great job on that.  Especially "line of sight", which is a serious issue in XCom, is well executed in Omerta.  Everything also seems to be nicely balanced.  I'm not sure how active the multiplayer community is, I'm afraid it's pretty dead thanks to the bad publicity the game received.\n\nBugs: no big issues I'm aware of\nManagement part : fun, but pretty casual, not that much replay value\nTurn-based strategy missions : excellent\nGangster setting : great\n\nMaybe I'm biased because I really like both the genre (management + turn-based strategy) and the setting (gangsters).  So it probably depends what you're looking for.  Biggest issue seems to me the limited replay value.\n","May 1, 2014","true","7.4"," 22 of 28 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","22","28","0","1"

The atmosphere is absolutely incredible and you feel like you've hopped into a time machine and traveled back to the 20's.  The single-player story was far deeper and more enjoyable than I had first expected it to be.  You create your character by answering about half a dozen questions regarding their past and begin play at about the time they step off of the boat in the United States.  From then on, you begin to form connections, set up (or extort) little businesses (some legitimate, others as fronts for the illegal activity taking place within), rob banks, chase off other gangs, etc.  All of this takes place while an overarching storyline with several twists and turns plays out along the way.\n\nThe business management side of the game is entertaining, and simple enough to learn quickly without a significant time investment.  On each map there are dozens of lots that can be built on (if there isn't already a building there), purchased, taken over, or firebombed by your gang.  On these lots are everything from pizza shops to speakeasies to casinos to gun shops to smuggling rings, each with their own purpose and choice of upgrades.\n\nThe combat aspect of the game is can most easily be compared to XCOM.  It's a turn-based tactical combat system that utilizes a variety of unit stats, skills, and equipment to engage in battles where a limitless number of approaches are possible.  Though you can only ever have six members of your gang working directly with you at any given time, every single member of your gang levels up at the same time - a massive convenience for those Dons who prefer to swap gang members in and out on the fly.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone who enjoys tactical turn-based strategy, light business sims, and that Mafia-era Roaring Twenties setting.","January 25, 2015","true","50.8"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

That is mixed with a turn based city builder that is somewhat fun, but really no depth to it.  It's like if Tropico was a facebook game, including the part where you just have to sit there and look at your screen until you accrue more resources to do the next thing you want to do.  Cover is completely broken, still. I really can't believe they're putting out DLC without fixing a horribly broken cover system.  Enemies shoot you through walls, barrels, objects etc. sometimes hitting on all 3 shots a turn even though your guy shouldn't even be visible in his current cover spot.  On the flip side, sometimes your character can't see someone who would be quite obviously visible if the situation were real.  I literally had an enemy stab me through a window, end his turn there, but then my man standing right outside the (ground floor) window couldn't see him...\n\nIt still manages to be fun at times, which makes its complete failures more frustrating.\n\nWhat gets me writing this review though, is the dishonesty of selling this game as "75% off, down to $9.99 (USD)"\n\nThis game is nowhere. freaking. close. to a $40 game.  This is one of those bargain bin games that doesn't realize it should be selling at $10 on a normal day at this point, been out for a long time, no buzz generated, deservedly poor metacritic reviews.\n\nSo ok, if I mark up a turd by 10 times what it's worth, and then discount it to twice what it's worth, is that a deal?\n\nAnyway, wait till it drops down to proper turd prices.

This barely ekes out a thumbs up review; my impressions were mostly negative in the first few hours, but it's one of those games that gets better once you know the ropes.\n\nOmerta features a mix of strategy, sim and RPG gameplay with resource/city management occurring on a main map and turn-based combat on individual, smaller maps.  The setting is cool: Atlantic City, New Jersey during the 1920's-30's Prohibition era with a thematic focus on American crime lords and their gangs.\n\nFour difficulty settings: Easy, Medium, Hard & Insane.  The last two I wouldn't bother with.  It's not fun losing a combat only to have your gangsters jailed (requiring another combat mission to spring them from the slammer).  Nor is it fun watching a rival gang slowly cover the map in red, taking over your properties along the way.  Easy difficulty on the other hand just isn't compelling since you'll run into long stretches of time with little or nothing to really do, waiting on jobs to finish or businesses to amass enough cash to accomplish your objective.  That said, Medium is the best bet, but even this doesn't feel particularly well balanced.  There will still be boring moments and frustrating ones too.  Give it a chance, though - with a few missions under your belt you'll know what to do & it'll grow more engaging.\n\nThe turn-based combat mode, while not spectacular, is satisfying - once your crew is leveled up a bit and outfitted with better weapons, that is.  Initially it'll feel daunting and perhaps a bit clunky.  I enjoyed the RPG style character progression and had fun trying different lineups for combat.  It feels a bit arbitrary and overly difficult on anything higher than Medium.\n\nThere are several changes I'd make to Omerta.  One is simply a quicksave/quickload function, another is the ability to remap all keys.  It'd be great if there were a game speed setting to fast forward while you're just waiting on income to generate.  A beef I have is that on leveling up, you only choose perks for the crew you have active on the map; remaining gangsters in your roster automatically have perks chosen.  It kind of forces you to stick with the same team of six over an entire campaign rather than being able to mix it up, as the AI doesn't always choose perks wisely.\n\nVisuals & audio are acceptable.  It looks slightly dated for 2013 but in my opinion captures the Prohibition look.  The soundtrack is fun & upbeat but quickly gets repetitive.\n\nMechanics all functioned as intended.  I encountered only a couple of non game-breaking bugs; one hilarious bug worked in my favor, allowing my Hitman to finish jobs instantly: I took out a rival gang in under a minute on the map via Drive-By's.\n\nThe game comes with cooperative & competitive multiplayer modes as well as a sandbox mode with a variety of maps; these I did not try.\n\nIf you have the Gold Edition of Omerta, you also get a few DLC missions/characters which are fine, but more importantly The Japanese Incentive.  This DLC expansion is notable for extending the game's length greatly & introducing a big new mechanic: rival gangs.  You may notice during the main campaign (which you should definitely play first) a number of buildings & upgrades intended to work against enemies; these never actually get used until the expansion, and can be safely ignored until then.\n\nTJI adds a new layer to gameplay, requiring you to be busier with defending against & responding to enemy activity.  Key things to remember about this feature:\n"Hire Goons," the $1,000 upgrade: Doesn't work well since it's high cost but protects against only a single attack on the upgraded business.  Attacks can come in quick succession & this upgrade should only be used on critical assets (like your Security Agency).\nLookouts, Security Agency & Hit Squad: These are costly & thus difficult to acquire early on, but do the legwork for you when it comes to offense/defense.  Not having at least some of these while a rival gang is on the map can make life difficult.  The range on Lookouts is too small, however, and you should resign yourself to possibly losing some territory.  The Heat generated by going on the offensive & the monetary cost of replacing lost businesses hurt, so get a Security Agency and/or Hit Squad to cover these, unless you plan to eliminate your rival quickly.\nUncover the map, fast: Time is a factor.  Be mindful of what's required to reveal new areas (including the enemy Hideout).  These interactions show up on the minimap as green X's and dots.  Need higher Feared rating to intimidate a shopkeeper into spilling the beans on his neighborhood?  Well, you should've built a Pizzeria (+Feared) instead of a Soup Kitchen (+Liked), huh..\nStock up on guns: Offense in most forms requires firearms, so get 'em when & where you can.There are different strategies for dealing with rival gangs.  The one that usually works for me is treating it like a race to uncover their Hideout, figure out how to make it vulnerable, then destroy.  That won't always be possible, in which case rely on the Security Agency, otherwise this feature which should be a welcome addition will seem like a hassle.\n\nAt the end of my time with Omerta, I decided on a thumbs up review since I had fun despite the problems.  It's not often we get stuff with the mafia/mobster theme, either.  I recommend this game to any player drawn by the theme.  Anyone interested strictly in gameplay would do better sticking to more polished entries into the genre, such as XCOM: Enemy Unknown.  The Tips section of this review is particularly relevant, so check it out if you're going to play.\n\nTIP: (Investigations/Heat mechanic) To spare new players a bit of headache: police investigations trigger at 5 stars on the "Heat" meter, bottom right of screen.  This has to be dealt with, but "Destroy the Evidence" missions are not advisable without powerful gangsters.  Those are a last ditch measure for when alternative, easier options are unavailable.  Options like betraying other crooks, bribing cops, using businesses (Lawyer & Safe House), etcetera.\n\nTIP: (Character Class) Learn what effect each gangster type has and get a nice variety in your crew composition.  I prefer two Masterminds, two Hitmen, and Enforcer & a Grifter.  Hitmen don't raise Heat level on jobs, Masterminds do jobs faster, Burglars take more reward from theft, etcetera.  Use these to minimize heat, expand efficiently & ensure the mission proceeds smoothly.\n\nTIP: (Unique Weapons) Keep an eye out for weapon upgrade opportunities on the campaign map, as they significantly bolster combat effectiveness & enable you to take on tougher encounters with ease.  Unique weapons are the most costly & powerful in game (purple colored nametags).\n\nTIP: (Save Often) You can't back out of combat missions, so save frequently & be prepared for both scripted & unscripted encounters.  Be aware that enemy reinforcements can arrive behind your position in certain encounters, too.\n\nTIP: (Too Much Froth) Don't ever sell beer to the Rabbi; it will always have too much froth for that miser!  O'Connor will also frequently haggle & complain about shoddy merchandise if you sell him firearms.","July 9, 2015","true","53.8"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","15","20","0","0"

I would give it a 6 out of 10. If it is on sale, Pick it up, it is fun. But sadly, it gets old fast. There is barely too much for replayability - in fact, after the first few levels, you start noticing there is barely too much for advancement.\n\nFirst of all, I loved Mob Rules from back in the early/mid 90s. I'm also a fan of stories about the prohibition era. I don't think society would cope with prohibition now, and much less in the 20s when this took place. That is why stories are so fascinating to me. But every game about the mob during prohibition is the same, more or less, and they run dry after long.\n\nI'll sum it up with a list of pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n\n- Good story line. It isn't strong, and in fact, far from original. But it is still a good story line. It is a little unique, but nothing special. Start small, build a reputation, and become big. It even spans the full prohibition era, for the most part.\n\n- Pretty decent city management sim. Again, nothing special here, but it is fun for a bit. There are quite a few options.\n\n- Plenty of maps. Each one increases in options and difficulty - but again, nothing too spectacular.\n\n- A lot of weapons and skills. Henchmen have plenty of skills to choose from, and each one can bring unique things to the table. You also have plenty of henchment to chose from based on play styles, so if you want a team of masterminds, or maybe thugs - there is room for this.\n\n\nCons:\n\n- Every level, you start fresh. You bring a little bit from previous missions, and you get more increasing difficulties.\n\n- Every map starts becoming the same thing - over and over again. Start small, build up without becoming too noticed by the cops. Bribe them, and keep a low profile. They become terribly easy and uncreative after long, especially when you start learning what to do.\n\n- The learning curve isn't great enough to keep a steady interest. It is easy to learn, and easy to master. Again, once you find a good solid stratagy, every map is the same. There may be one curve ball here and there - but nothing to special.\n\n- The game only becomes more "difficult" because people rat you out (to be expected) and because the prohibition is coming to an end, cutting into your profits (again, to be expected). No real sense of accomplishment, more a sense of "Well, I survived and made a profit early on..."\n\n- The story can be exceptionally predictable. No real surprises, and very few curveballs to keep you on your toes. Easy to go on autopilot.\n\n- After finding a winning stratagy, the game turns into "Send henchmen somewhere, afk for a few minutes, come back and check on profits and missions completed."\n\n- Rival AI is.... lacking. Seriously, there is no challenge from them. They litterally let you walk all over them and don't try to stop you. You can raid their places too easily, but nothing from them to retaliate. It's like they don't care at all they are losing to you.\n\n- Severe lack of a hard mode at all... At least, I didn't notice any difference on the difficulty settings.\n\nAgain - It is a good game, don't get me wrong. but not really a $30-40 game.... Maybe a cool $8 game on holiday/summer sale, when you want to see what the prohibition is like.","November 4, 2014","true","24.1"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","15","22","0","0"

A game that takes place in 1920's Atlantic City where you play as a mob boss? That sounds awesome! Sadly, Omerta City of Gangsters is more bathtub gin than fine wine.\n\nOne of this game's biggest problems is that it is pretty boring. There is a lot of downtime during the management sections, since there is no ability to speed up time. This is a pretty glaring omission considering this game uses almost the same kind of city managment style as the Tropico series, which does have the ability to speed up time. When you send a gangester out on a mission, like buying a property to set up a business, they have to walk all the way there and all the way back. This can be sped up by stealing cars, but it still takes far too long. The structure of a lot of the missions also means that you spend a lot of time simply sitting around waiting for your businesses to accumulate x number of dollars so you can move on to the next stage, with nothing interesting to do in the meantime. The game also has a "heat" system, which is the only real failure state. By committing crimes, you generate heat. When your heat reaches 5 stars, the police will launch an investigation. If you can't  weasel your way out of it via a bribe, you lose. You would think that a system like this is in place so players have a risk/reward with high heat actions gaining more money but also more heat, but everything you do in the game generates heat, so its basically just an arbitrary timer that ticks up as you play.\n\nAll of this would be a little more forgivable if the other major section of the game was any better. That other section being turn based squad combat heavily inspired by XCOM. You bring a small squad of gangsters armed with various weapons, including the iconic Tommy gun, on a mission to take over businesses or rob banks. The weapon variety is extremely limited, with only eight different weapons to choose from, three of them being melee weapons.  The game features a cover system that works identically to XCOM, with cover reducing the enemy chance to hit, as well as the damage recieved.\n\nUnfortunately, because the combat had to be balanced with melee weapons in mind, the guns are extremely weak. Because of this, cover is not extremely vital. The AI will constantly just run up to you, never bothering to take cover, and proceed to shoot you from point blank or charge you down with melee weapons. The only two weapons this strategy doesn't really work against are the Tommy gun and the shotgun, since both fire in a cone that is more concentrated the closer they are to the target. Even this would be slightly more forgivable if it meant that you had to more carefully arm your gangsters to counter the enemy, but the way weapon acquistion is handled in the game is also problematic. Every character in the game has a default weapon and a distinct playstyle, but you can aquire new weapons from arms dealers in the world. However, the arms dealers only sell one weapon, and what weapon it is is completely random. If you are hunting for a Tommy gun and all the arms dealer has is a baseball bat, you are out of luck. The ability to either buy whatever weapon you want from arms dealers, or the ability to loot enemies would have made the game a lot more enjoyable,\n\nUnfortunately for Omerta, I must break the code of silence to say that this is not a very good game. It has a lot of potential, but executes on almost none of it.

It seemed like one of those instant bestsellers popping out of nowhere. After having played it for quite a while though, I cannot recommend it. You play as an italian (surprise eh) immigrant looking to make a fortune in the U.S.. Most of your actions are performed on a top-down map in real time. You can rent premises, establish some businesses like illegal breweries, boxing rings and pizzerias (yup) and they will generate money and ressources, which can be sold for even more money. You have a selection of gang-members at your disposal who will carry out your orders, like gathering information or eliminating a rival casino. This has all been done before, I remember playing Gangsters 2 by EIDOS and having a lot more fun. My main problem is that missions are way too short and as soon as you finish one, you start another one with all your achievements gone, from scratch. There is no continuity apart from who your gang-members are. You cannot have custom members either, as all of them come with preset backgrounds, portaits and loadouts. Additionally, they threw in a XCOM'esque turn-based-combat system for some special missions. While being an interesting addition, it just does not work that well and, again, other games have done it better. The multiplayer is a joke. You would expect to be able to play a big campaign in a vibrant city with multiple people, but all there is is 1on1 turn-based-combat matches, or Coop against the AI. No big Mafia-empire simulator to have hours of fun in, no intriguing scheme-play between you and your friends... just some rushed, copied gameplay definitely not worth full price.","February 2, 2013","false","4.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

In every mission you'll do the same things over and over, but somehow it remains fun and has that 'one more game' feeling. Until later on...\n\nNear the end of the game the AI becomes ridiculously precise during combat. Something that becomes even more frustrating when you're only metres away from your enemies and still miss every single shot. I must have played a mission like that for 10 times and still never made any progress. The game also autosaves before combat so loading a previous game will have you select your gangsters for combat, but there's no way to cancel this action. You will and must fight. What's the use of a savegame like this ? Because I surely don't know.\n\nAnyway, the graphics are sharp, and sometimes stylish, but mostly bland. Tthe music fits the genre and setting, and the sounds get the job done.

The redeeming features is the rather fun management mode in the RTS sections that gladly you spend at least 80% of your time doing. Buying buildings and construction sites to build many different buildings. These earn you fear and Respect,  and happiness and people like you more, both needed for certain aspects of the game.  However most importantly you earn money, sweet sweet money.\n\nThe graphics of the game are fairly well done, they look well detailed and the game ran perfectly on my system at 120fps constant. I didn‚Äôt test if the game was 3D or not however the time needed to play the game id rather not play it long hours with 3D enabled regardless. The story is sadly just lacking, I felt uninterested in the story other than what the objectives were and paid no attention to the overall story of the game and whilst I enjoyed the music a lot in the game I couldn‚Äôt help feel it didn‚Äôt match the game.\n\nPros:\n-	Nice Gangster themed game that hits all the notes.\n-	Good art design and graphics\n-	Nice RTS intergration.\n\nCons:\n-	Just purely unenjoyable combat\n-	Feels dragged out\n-	Gets very repetitive early on into the game\n\nI would give this game a 5/10, it has many issues, I missed a bunch of them as well as the launch of the game was said to be horrific so im glad I missed out on them however the game feels barebones yet enjoyable for the single play though I did, I just couldn‚Äôt wait to finish it.\n\n- Dean- I'd only really get it, if you like me like Ganster themed games, no matter the big flaws.","December 17, 2013","true","17.0"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

This game caught my eye because it combined some of my favorite things gangsters and stragtey games. This game takes us back to a prohibition Atlantic City or commonly known as the playground of the world. And in this city you can build you're criminal empire anyway you choose whether you go mostly clean and build pharmacies to sell "medical liquor" to the masses or set up a safehouse to set up for a heist. After setting up your money makers you're going to need to fight off you enemies, whitch could vary between the KKK or a rival gang looking to take your business and your spot as a big time mob family. And if you're going to declare war on these other factions you're going to need henchmen to dirty work and take a bullet for you every now and then. Each goon has their own backrounds and bios but ultimately you end up caring about one and the rest are cannon fodder; my favorite ended up being sqiugs. But each character has his or her own weapon any where from brass knuckles to tommy guns to shotguns. And speaking of weapons the combat is a lot like X-COM with cover and percentage based shots but, unlike X-COM not all cover and buildings are breakable which makes sense, bullets can only do so much damage and in X-COM you can not build and destoy mob empires. And the guns all serve their purpose with shotguns and tommy guns being for wide spread damage, and rifles and pistols being more accurate. And the mulltiplayer seem to have good intentions but, it dosen't have the empire constructing; just the combat. In the end, the multiplayer feels tacked on. Well, we come to the big question is this game worth the money and I find myself saying its worth you're money, but not worth Forty Dollars. I aqiured this game on sale and I reconmend the same or at least untill a price drop. But don't get me wrong this game is deserving of your money, but in my opinion not Forty Dollars.","December 11, 2013","true","17.4"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","1"

You'll spend time just watching over, micro managing, or even not managing at all.\n\nThe combat system feels like an XCOM style system. Granted that again there isn't much to it, just taking cover, shooting over cover, killing badguys and stealing loot, you'd get more fun out of an XCOM game. Granted you can play using perma-death rules, the only real penalties for losing mob members is a slow down in activities during the tycoon stage, and the invevitable game over.\n\nOverall if the two sections were fleshed out more and felt better to play with, it'd be more fun.

It really puts you in the concept of gangsters.\nBesides, you have to plan things out, so you can run your business without being suspicious. It's all in the strategy.\nI played for plenty of minutes REALLY cool for the concept.\nStill, there are quite some downers. The main reason it's the price of it. I got it on sale (75%), but if wasn't for it, I wouldn't buy it. It's too much for what the game offers you. Another thing is that the maps while you are in the combat phase seem all too much the same. I asked myself plenty of times: "Haven't I done this mission already?!" - Just because the maps are all too much alike. Also, if you're the type of person who don't like to wait, this is not the game for you. You got to be patiente about the resources and when to strike (Because of heat).\nSo... I give this game 4 out of 5, if you're not looking to prices. Recommend it :)","December 5, 2013","true","7.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Since I love mafia games (Like Mafia, Mafia 2) and love Tropico I thought this would be a lot of fun. And indeed it was..... in the first 40mins. After about an hour, it got boring but I forced myself to play it even longer. After all, there was a small chance it would get better, but sadly, it didnt.\nDont get me wrong, it isnt a bad game, it just isnt a good game. The graphics, the voice acting and the basics of the game are amazing and that makes it even harder when you find out that the game literally through away all the possibility it had and ended up like that.\nYou have basic base building with decoration. Your people can steal cars, you can buy different buildings and do missions for all kinds of people, but it is not enough. It has the same problem Tropico has. There is a bit of everything, but not enough. There are to few missions, to few things todo and, oh god, this really bad combat system. I spent a lot of time in XCOM: EU and I love turned base games since then, but this game messed it up really bad. I dont rage often, but this made me rage. Just bad.\n\nSo, please make a another Omerta game but listen to all the reviews and fix what you have done wrong here. The idea is good, the concept in many areas too.\n\nSo, should you buy Omerta? No, no you shouldnt.","July 19, 2014","false","4.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Think "Boardwalk Empire" meets "Tropico" (The latter of which should feel familiar given it's the same developers).\n\nYou do business by dealing in three commodities: beer, liquor and firearms. Beer is cheap and easy, liquor is a bit harder and can get you "clean" money (Itself used to purchase legitimate businesses), firearms are generally later in the round and are rather lucrative. This is done via a top-down interface that is somewhat real-time. Actions in this mode can result in tactical turn-based battles, pitting your mobsters against police, FBI and other gangs.\n\nI played it on a trip and the hours flew by. The atmosphere is great and the single-player campaign is spot-on. I don't have any experience with the multiplayer, though I expect I'd get my derriere handed to me if I tried (If I ever try the multiplayer, I'll make sure to update this review with my experiences).\n\nQuite recommended, especially if on sale.","December 23, 2013","true","19.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It feels as if the developers focused more on the combat system and didn't really put much effort in the city management system. The combat system itself is good, my only concern is when you miss shots when an enemy is right in front of you and sometimes the AI is too unbalanced. At times, I felt the game was slow as you wait for resources and money to stack up or when you send one of your henchmen on a mission. The ability to manipulate time would have been a good addition.\n\nIf you want to kill time, get it cheap and play. You'll enjoy it for a few hours unless you can cope with repetitiveness.

You don't walk around town controlling your character and get into gangfights. The gangfights happen as part of what is esentially a Sim City environment. They are set up in a pretty straightforward manner. On normal difficulty and easy its pretty much slug it out until you eventually win. On hard the curve is "Too easy as you learn the basics" to "Too hard as you now are given a challenge" to "Too easy again, as you've now unlocked high level powers." Sandbox mode seemed fun, till I realised the AI uses the same generic units for that too, meaning they always outnumber you still. You can't bring more than 4 men into a fight, but the enemy can bring in 11, all of which have similar (a few have had even better) stats than you.\n\nEdit: After playing a little more, there is perhaps more depth than I originally felt. While sometimes the difficulty is untweaked, my first run ins with the game seem to have just been a little more difficult than the average fight (I'm now more commonly hitting groups of 5 than 11.) I'm changing my recommendation to a thumbs up, but there are more satisfying experiences out there.","December 5, 2013","true","9.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The actual turn-based combat is fun, the enemy AI is strong. But the city management element is shallow, slow and repetitive.\n\nYou'd think I hate the game. In some ways it's easy to be disappointed when you know this game comes from the developers of the Tropico-franchise. Ironically, I find the game to be strangely addictive. The world looks great, the characters are wacky, the soundtrack fits perfectly and the game overall does a good job at getting you into the game through a good tutorial, and keeping you hooked for hours on end.\n\nOmerta is an addictive game, for sure. And if you actually get into it, it's quite a bit of fun too. It's only too bad that the unique and promising elements of the game are ruined by how shallow everything is. There's not much thought or planning required when playing, and you never really feel like your choices matter all that much in the long run.\n\nWith a lengthy singleplayer-campaign with a decent variation in the missions themselves aswell as added cooperative and competitive multiplayer modes, Omerta is fun if you're into the theme and genre. But It is however NOT worth the outrageous ‚Ç¨45 pricetag. Not by a long shot.","February 3, 2013","false","11.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

It has a good story, with great environment as a Prohibition Era simulator.\n\nThe gameplay is entertaining, you manage your criminal empire, renting warehouses to expand storage facilities, drive-byes to vacate the competition and establish you own joints or premises from which you draw income in dirty or clean money. There is also an RPG element as you can hire and fire characters to your gang and develop their skills, this however seems to be scripted in the campaign.\n\nThe turn based combat system is fun to play but can also be incredibly unfair even with high leveled characters. The cover system seems a bit broken and does break the excitement.\nThe game itself holds a lot of potential, but could be improved in so many aspects that it didn‚Äôt even require a new game. Buildings like the deputy houses, the crime lord‚Äôs house, celebrity houses or city officials are nothing more than simple houses with very little detail. The construction lots are a good example of how great it could have been, because if you build a hotel it will look like a hotel, these are minor problems but could be improved if only a little more effort was put in the map design.\n\nSandbox mode was always a welcome addition in any game for me, until I played Omerta. It does offer more opportunities than the campaign, providing more of a challenge than the campaign but still manages to disappoint. It lacks proper rivals to compete or even a negotiation option because the A.I will simply attack your businesses at random with no chance to defend them without a security agency and then you need 5 firearms to retake each business and develop them all over again.\n\nJust like the campaign, you start each district from scratch with tons of renting possibilities which is always nice and does allow for a much larger organization than the campaign but it‚Äôs still unbalanced, you will get attacked randomly without notice and the goons you pay 1000$ each business to protect it, just vanish with 3 shots from a drive-by.\n\nI did love the environment of the campaign with the excellent prohibition environment, a nice soundtrack, good voice acting, and the gameplay is addictive and even if every district need to be started from scratch I didn‚Äôt really mind to much.\n\nIt is a bit rough around the edges and could use a bit more work like more maps, a more balanced combat and management system with deeper and unscripted character customization. I do recommend Omerta, it is a good game but it has a lot more potential, consider purchasing it at 75% sale.","September 18, 2015","true","35.4"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Thats all good and the game setting itself will probably have me come back for more because of its general feel.\n\nThe reason I am not recommending this game is the random factor of gun fights. The fact that a guy with a shotgun misses from point blank range on a guy that just punched him is ridiculos, and will drive you mad. The fact that a punch does more damage than a gun shot wound, even tho I understand trying to keep the game balanced in a way, is ridiculos.

(huge fan off it.) Unfortunatly I dislike this game after playing it for around 2-3 hours. You will become quickly bored. I mostly dislike the heat system, which you are put with 4 choices to stop investigation (which results in game over), run out of choices? Too bad, game is over for you.\n\nThe multiplayer setting is horrible, I actually thought you could play an entire map with people but apparantly it's only the turnbase gameplay.\n\nI agree it's a good concept, but a terrible execution. It could have been a great game.\n\nPRO's:\n-Decent graphics.\n-Variety of businesses you can build.\n-Perk system for crew.\n\nCON's:\n-No multiplayer sandbox, only turnbase maps.\n-When you pack too much heat and run out of choices it's game over and there is nothing you can do about it.\n-No free roam over the map (I wanted to drive cars across the maps and etc).\n\nIf you like the maffia setting, I honestly recommend the retro "street wars" game more then this, the gameplay was way more fun.

Stuff. There isn't a whole lot to do, only six maps all of which are very small and only a few action maps (where the combat takes place.) Many reviews claim it lacks in technicalities but I think it all works out great, it just lacks content. This game especially isn't worth anything over $20, it's crazy to think that this was a $60 game. It just isn't there it feels like a browser game honestly. Sandbox mode is horrible, you're best off just sandboxing in the campaign - because in sandbox mode, even though you may have everything set to easy some how the rival gang takes over the city within minutes and it's a pain to expand as they already have everything and the minute you establish something they take it over. A little more customization would've been nice as well on your character.\n\nIf it had more content, larger map and just an overall enhancement to everything this game would be great. The soundtrack is awesome as is the setting, gameplay and even the combat is pretty well done once you get the hang of it. It is a fun game to casually relax and play, works at your own pace and is pretty laid back with relaxing music to jive to so it is initially fun but after awhile you'll start to see how much it lacks and what it could've been then it just makes you sad and want to stop playing. Hell even the voice acting is amazing and so are the graphics, honestly it's probably some of the best voice acting I've heard.\n\nNot recommended unless you get this game for under $10 or free.","July 22, 2015","false","12.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Not much in form of back story, you arrive to America and begin notorious career path as gangster. Every mission is split into part of city that has different points of interest you can purchase, rent, buyout or simply take by force from owners and make your own. Your primary income is dirty and clean money.\n\nDirty money is useful to fuel shady businesses and can be laundered for use in legit businesses. Clean money is useful to buy property, invest in legal businesses or to buy new vehicles for your crew. Every crew member can complete tasks in city, and having a personal vehicle speeds up the process.\n\nYou can level up, add perks, buy weapons for your crew members to make them more effective in combat. Secondary resources include beer, liquor, firearms. You use firearms to assault enemy businesses, perform drive-by or simply open weapons store for profit. Beer and liquor can be sold for profit, complete missions, influence certain characters. Some businesses require steady amount of beer / liquor to be profitable.\n\nSome businesses work better depending on your Liked / Feared amount. You gain Liked and Feared rating by building structures that boost either of those stats. Hostile actions increase Feared rating as well, but also increase your Heat level, that eventually will attract police investigation.\n\nGame may feel repetitive few hours in, as you basically do same thing on every mission. Personally I really liked how game looks and sounds, especially the music and voice acting.","August 15, 2015","true","12.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I like the game at times so thats why ill continue to play it, because I like the buisness ventures and running a small peice of territory.\n\nThe main thing I will focus on is the combat encounters and a few elements in terms of the games options. In a nutshell, the combat encounters are awful, the turn based mechanic has not been made well made at all and I find that most of the time my characters miss the most obvious easy shots; for example I will have a 70% chance of hitting a target and I have enough points to hit him 3 times, more or less I will miss all 3 times. I know that this is what stratagy/turn based combat is about, but its not friendly even to those that have played such games, most turn based that I have played offer a better way to enjoy the combat, but this game offers no satisfaction in it whatsoever.\n\nThe other thing is the options the game has, after a while in one location you will start to get fairly bored of repetative tasks and jobs, once u more or less buy every joint/buisness then u will turn to just spending money for no reason as there is nothing much else to do and this is accomplished after around 2 hours of playing one map/mission. I would like this more if there was an option to create an empire rather then do it by location and gain nothing to use in next location that you could have in the previous.\n\nThat being said, i recommend this game to those who like a small run around/buisness development stratagy game and if you can get it cheap like I did for ¬£1.59 on sale, but it is not worth the full price.\n\nDo I recommend this game?

I expected a lot more out of it when I first purchased it. One of my biggest let downs was that each chapter requires you to start over. The game should allow you to build up in one city then carry over the business and build a "family" over a larger area expanding. It would allow for turf wars. Also it should let you "outline" your family. As a mob boss you should be able to shape your organization based on your own ideas. For instance if you do not like prostitution or drugs don't capatilize on those industries allowing rival families to tap into that capital. The game felt to lineral. I would really like to see more out of this game. Looking forwars to a second game to come out that focuses more on strategy and molding the family. A lot of potential, fun play through the first go... A lot more could come from this game.","November 14, 2015","true","4.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I like the game at times so thats why ill continue to play it, because I like the buisness ventures and running a small peice of territory.\n\nThe main thing I will focus on is the combat encounters and a few elements in terms of the games options. In a nutshell, the combat encounters are awful, the turn based mechanic has not been made well made at all and I find that most of the time my characters miss the most obvious easy shots; for example I will have a 70% chance of hitting a target and I have enough points to hit him 3 times, more or less I will miss all 3 times. I know that this is what stratagy/turn based combat is about, but its not friendly even to those that have played such games, most turn based that I have played offer a better way to enjoy the combat, but this game offers no satisfaction in it whatsoever.\n\nThe other thing is the options the game has, after a while in one location you will start to get fairly bored of repetative tasks and jobs, once u more or less buy every joint/buisness then u will turn to just spending money for no reason as there is nothing much else to do and this is accomplished after around 2 hours of playing one map/mission. I would like this more if there was an option to create an empire rather then do it by location and gain nothing to use in next location that you could have in the previous.\n\nThat being said, i recommend this game to those who like a small run around/buisness development stratagy game and if you can get it cheap like I did for ¬£1.59 on sale, but it is not worth the full price.\n\nDo I recommend this game? Not at full price...","July 6, 2014","false","10.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This means registering and verifying your email address. To play an offline game. Yes, unlike how 90% of the industry does it.\n\nAlso keep in mind this was originally a Facebook game. So I can only guess what all that means in terms of what ratrace/paywall/in game purchase nightmares might await in line with how most Facebook games work. I can only guess, yaknow, cuz 4 hours later I still can't play the game because I can't login, because their server isn't sending confirmation emails, and Kalypso's support doesn't answer emails.\n\nDO NOT RECOMMEND.","December 8, 2013","false","5.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's similiar to Gangsters on the PC that came out in the 90's with managing the rackets and the enconomy and everything but the thing that really wrecks this game is the combat system. It is terrible, just terrible. First of all it's repetitive, second of all it's got such a fast difficulty curve. The first few are so-so, then they go to downright impossible sometimes. It's just not worth spending over ‚Ç¨10 getting. Last but not least is the voice acting is laughably bad on some characters. I might try to see what this game is like multiplayer before I can really full on trash it but there are some positives.

So, I guess what I'll say is this: If you wanna buy it because you think it will be similar to the above mentioned games, don't, it's not. If you are looking at it on it's own merits, then I'd suggest reading a few more reviews.","January 11, 2015","false","0.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","3"

The base game lacks a variety of prison maps, but the Japanese Incentive DLC drastically improves the combat map varieties.\n\nThe stats of characters do not impact the performance of characters on the strategic map (moving around the map and building buildings), however character classes DO impact how well they execute their actions. Masterminds finish quests faster, Grifters +populace favor, enforcers +fear, hitmen prevent giving you attention for doing most criminal acts. There's a severe lack of variety in classes, Plenty of characters however.\n\nThis game's single player campaign is pretty fun, with a story that is filled with gangster drama, it took me 150 hours to complete all the missions +bonus dlc missions AND the expansion (still a bit heart broken).\n\nMusic is very nice, it gives that prohibition era vibe with blues and big bands. What would have made the game nicer is if choice was if the story wasn't linear, because the endings were severely underwhelming after what you accomplish.\n\nThe maps are small for a city builder game and this might sound as if it's a terrible idea for a city builder game, until you realize how god painful it is to move scroll from location to location or click on a mini map multiple times.\n\nThis game's strategic play will seem dull after you finish the base campaign, but the Japanese Incentive expansion makes it much more fun and intense, where you're up against an AI (playing the game on insane, the AI really knows how to knock you over). Outside the highest aggressiveness the AI will not seem very hard to beat if you're used to playing strategy games. In most scenarios turtling will make you win, but let's be honest that's almost all strategy games.\n\nThis game was worth buying at it's current price of this genre.\n\nI don't know of any game that mixes REAL TIME strategic city building and light version of turn based combat seen in games such as Xcom.","January 12","true","155.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

The coop would be fun if it wasn't for the fact that there are only two levels and one of the levels freezes up all the time, and the cops spawn in almost the exact same locations each time.\n\nDO NOT BUY.","April 6, 2013","false","28.2"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kryskiller666/recommended/208520/","kryskiller666","BadassFreeman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kryskiller666/","217 products in account","I had a friend constantly telling me to buy this game for over a year. Almost everytime I said something about games such as XCOM, Dungeon Keeper, Evil Genius or similar games, he reminded me that I should totally buy this game because I will like it.\n\nA few days ago he went right ahead and bought it for me, even after I told him countless times not to do it. And in the end, I did not like the game that much. As usual, I will speak about the bad things of the game first:\n\nFirst and foremost, this game tries REALLY HARD to be the Gangster XCOM, but in the end fails hard. During combat, you have multiple units (a max of 4 units with one guy as Support, and in some cases allied units controlled by the game), which aparently evolve as you play. However, I can't really see any evolution. During the almost 4 hours I've played, SOME of my characters leveled up ONCE, and I don't see any "Experience left to LVLUP" anywhere at all. The game didn't tell me at any moment how or when do I level up. Then, we have the weapons of the characters. It's kind of a joke, but pistols felt way more powerful THAN MOTHERF#CKING SHOTGUNS. AT POINT BLANK RANGE. Range on itself seems to be a joke and I don't see anyway of changing the weapons your characters have, while the biggest problem with the game is cover. The maps are filled with objects, but they don't really offer a big advantage, and blow up after getting hit once or twice anyway. In the end, it feels like a poor attempt of ripping off XCOM which backfired.\n\nOutside of combat, we have a Strategy game, really similar of the Tropico games (it's made by the same guys, and it seems to run on the same engine as Tropico 4, as I've seen some models being reused). However, there's not that much to it. There's two kinds of money, you can buy buildings that will get you more dirty or clean money, you can get more firearms... But in the end, I just wish I was playing Tropico 4, as it feels shallow and unfinished. The enemy never seems to do anything that interesting. At times you'll get the police investigating your ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, but you can just bribe them off, tell them someone else did it, kill the witness and stuff like that. Maps are also too small on my opinion, at least compared to the huge islands you could have in Tropico games.\n\nSomething that also pisses me off, and that this company seems to enjoy doing, is DRM. WHAT IS THE BIG IDEA!? THE GAME IS ON STEAM, WHY DOES IT NEED THIS!? You're forced to make an account on their damn page, and log on everytime you want to play. For me, it just feels amateur-ish. Like they want to do it because the big companies, like EA or Ubisoft do it. Well, that sucks, good job.\n\nI also see that the game has some weird AI. For example, you can steal cars which serve as a ride for your characters, so they move faster. However, your characters will at times take the car and run arround a few blocks when THEY ONLY HAVE TO CROSS THE STREET, TO A HOUSE THAT'S RIGHT INFRONT OF THEIR BASE. It's redundant as hell, makes your characters, at times, TAKE LONGER TO GET SOMEWHERE ON A CAR, THAN ON FOOT. And the cars break down constantly, so I don't even bother most of the time. You can also buy a car, but seems stupid when the whole city is filled with cars that you can steal.\n\nAim also seems to be a joke. Funny enough, it feels like they based that on XCOM. There, people have felt betrayed at the game because you can miss point blank shoots and crap, which is insanely unlucky, but it can happen. Here on this game, I constantly missed 75% shots, which felt lame as hell because my enemies almost never missed. Now top that with the damn cover mechanics that felt unfinished, and you have an atomic bomb of dissapointment and fustration.\n\nThe game also lacks a way to speed things up. You'll be at times waiting for crap to happen, while your resources keep rising and your henchmen go somewhere. If there was the option in Tropico, WHY NOT HERE!?\n\nLastly, character customization. There's nearly noone. At the start you can choose stats, but it's never explained what those stats do, when will they do anything, NOTHING AT ALL. While being able to select your stats with questions is cool, it would also be great if you could also choose a weapon or some sort of equipment at the start.\n\nSo, does the game have good stuff? Yeah. The soundtrack is good. The voices are decent (most characters sound bored as hell, and some even throw unfunny jokes, but outside of that they're good), there seems to be a lot of maps (even though they're small, short and the game sells more in DLC's), you get the picture. However, it's a flawed game that feels unfinished, that might appeal to a small amount of people while being boring to much others.\n\nOn my opinion, don't buy it. If you like the economic part of the game, buy Tropico 4. If you like the combat areas of it, buy XCOM; Enemy Unknown. And if you do wish to buy this game, wait for a sale, and probably wait to be dissapointed. It's pretty much a Monopoly game based on the 1920's, that's missing half the board.\n\nWell, at least I got dissapointed for free, this time.","December 20, 2015","false","3.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","1"

This is extremely easy to do, and after the tutorial you won't change a thing throughout the game. This strategy is "Don't do the mission that triggers something" and buyup/build everything. This is even less fun than Settlers 7's repetitive setup.\n\nCombat is nothing like XCom. I've played many turn based games, and this is the WORST combat by far. Enemies just run out into the open to shoot you, or grab cover on a wall with their back to you and then shoot. Hit percents are strange, where you can hit a guy behind full cover easily, yet have a super low chance to hit someone two feet away around a corner. I could go on and on about annoyances of this combat. Not remotely fun.\n\nNot Recommended.","October 30, 2015","false","7.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","1"

In other words you have to constently be thinking of next steps ahead, and it hinders a player from rushing through it.  The game plays good in the begining and missions are fun, story line could be a bit more in depth and their could be a few things changed with hit and line of sight system.  However where this gets a negative is later on the game will on certain missions just freeze due to some game script or it will bug out.  Again its not bad to buy on sale, however i would not recomend paying full price for it.  Overall rating i would give is about a 2/5.  The town managment becomes very boring, as in you set up shops and stuff, alt tab and wait till money is there so you can continue on.  It sorta forces you to play slow without a choice.  Would i recomend this to a friend... As of now, i would say pass and buy another mafia style game out there till this one gets some more tweaks and kinks fixed.","January 1, 2015","false","173.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You play an overly simplified city builder for half an hour, interrupted every once in a while by "tactical" combat which requires no real thought or planning. After you win, you repeat this again a dozen times until the campaign ends.\n\nFor the city builder portion, a quarter of the buildings are so situational that you will never actually build them in the campaign. Another quarter is so clearly inferior to your other choices that you have to wonder why you would build them except for the missions that restrict you from constructing the better buildings.\n\nThe only progression you have in the game is the perks you get when your gangsters level and the weapons they can buy during the missions. Unfortunately the game handles this too poorly to actually make you feel like you're making any progress. Many of the perks offer only small numerical bonuses, while the good perks don't even really matter since you can almost always just shoot your way through a mission as long as you don't make any obviously bad tactical decisions. The weapons carry over through the campaign, but if you want them you'll end up just waiting in a mission long after you've won, just to make money to buy them. Later you can sell all the extra crap weapons you've bought to try and speed up the missions so I guess that's something.\n\nThe story which is the best part of the game, is fairly charming but wouldn't stand out if the rest of the game wasn't so poor. And this is a massive problem as the tiny chunks of plot each mission doles out, is almost unbearable for the repetitive gameplay that you put up with in the campaign.","January 30, 2015","false","25.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That makes it a lot slower paced, but not in a bad or good way - just in a "this isn't XCOM" way, which might not be what you're looking for.\n\nFor me, it's just right and I actually really enjoy playing. The combat is strategic (albeit starter guns feel almost based on random chance to hit sometimes) especially after you start buying better weapons and getting new henchmen - and the town gameplay takes a good amount of planning to get down right and is addictive somehow. The actual combat is actually challenging on a good level at times too - while in XCOM you either get through super easy or it's just TOO difficult.\n\nI recommend it if you don't mind a slower paced strategy game and like the mob - otherwise, just get XCOM if you want a lot of action and not much else or are more into sci-fi than mafia stuff.

The problem is it waivers between too slow while you wait for the resources you need and constantly keep re-bribing cops and starting over. The game would probably have been much more fun if, like The Godfather (the first game), you built up your criminal empire over time. Instead, you build up your current city of nowhere, do the few "story" missions which will give you some combat, reach some sort of resource goals, and start over.\n\nWithout the pleasure of really developing, the city/empire building feels completely hollow.\n\nThe combat is better, but it is still a significant step down from something like XCOM. At least if ou were doing it more, it would feel more important. The cover system seems rather flakey about always helping you rather than making you just crouch at a strange point. Combat also feels to draw out especially if a single baddie is hiding in some corner somewhere and you have to track it down.\n\nI admit to not making it to the part of the game where you can actually build structures and the like, but it was just so boring that I didn't care to continue.

It wants to be so much like X-Com, but just ends up being a huge pain in the rear with no real tactical options as some cover is just purely ignored and you can shoot through walls. To be fair, these encounters are not hard to beat and you are better of NOT to use the auto-resolve button.\nSo truly and honnestly, Omerta is a good game that just aims to combine too many genres, but still has a charm of its own and manages to keep you entertained for quite a while. A fair 7.5/10 on my scale.","November 26, 2014","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I can not put into words how bad of a taste this leaves in my mouth.  Spend money on a game with the expectation to play it, load the game, and you're presented with a screen that does not let you go past it until you give them you email.  Even for offline play.  What a slap in the face to the customers, AFTER recieving their money.\n\n2) SHORT, SMALL MAPS!.  The mapsize is TINY and once you expand into the couple of other neighborhoods (yes its that small), the game is over.  now what do you do, start over? just so you can rule the few blocks that is the entirety of the map?  Stupid.  (Disclaimer: as of august 2014, I have ALL of the DLC.  maps are still tiny)\n\nIn conclusion, if someone from kalypso ever reads this, you guys seriously need to stop this ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• with the kalypso launcher account.  I already paid for the game, have it bound to my steam account.  The last thing I want to do is screw around with some stupid account with a publisher.  (Just remember how bad the response was for the new simcity requiring you to be online, this is just as bad)  Quit that ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•.

And i was not in any way disappointed.\n\nThis is a nice little game (and yes it has some drawbacks, but which game dosnt?), campaign is somewhhat easy but sandbox is where its at, you can set a goal to reach for victory and then set the level of police and competition. This is where the game shines, once you start earning some money, the line between shooting up the competition to take over places and keeping the heat low enough so as not to attract police attention will keep you on your toes.\nAnd to the notion that you cannot lose, turn police and competition up to full, and put yourself to the test, im betting you wont win the first game, or the tenth.\n\nSadly however, even sandbox can be limited once you start to push back the competition (although he will continue to fight even when he dosnt own any businesses and is not generating money, and can become quite vicious). Once he is dead you own the city, and thats it. A nice feature would be the ability to expand into other cities once you have taken it over and compete against those you have been trading with.\n\nIts basically an indie version of The Godfather II Game with bonuses for running certain businesses (money laundeering, speakeasy etc.) and 'perk' type buildings such as the security firm (must be purchased with clean, not dirty money), which generates goons to protect your buildings.\nSo if you like that and gangster movies etc. definitly pick this bad boy up, try to grab it on sale tho, as its one for the library, but not the main one in it.","March 7, 2015","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Once you get your economy rolling, there's very little that can stop you. All of the "rival" gangsters are passive. They don't try to acquire territory from you or call drive by's or anything like that. They just sit there and let you gobble up territory. Still, the game is easy to sink time into. Micromanaging your little underground empire is satisfying, but could definitely benefit from aggressive AI or something. The only way to lose is for the police to launch an investigation. There are many, many, many ways to derail the investigation, however. You can bribe the police for a paltry sum, call in a favor from a deputy if you have good relations, pin it on a rival gangster or establishment, and destroy evidence.\n\nThe combat can be sort of wonky. Some weapons are clearly more useful than others. Combat is the only place where the game may provide some difficulty. The baseball bat guys are real ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•s. They chip your AP with each hit, do heavy damage, and have decent HP.\n\nAll in all, a decent game with a simple easy to learn interface that suffers from lack of challenge.","February 1, 2013","false","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Not to say thats a bad thing.\nThe main difference being there is a turn-based tactical battle system in it.\n\nMy first playthrough of the game i didn't care much for the game, as I got my butt kicked even on Normal difficulty. But I went back and played it on a better difficulty for me and really enjoyed it. I played it non-stop until I beat the map I was playing.\n\nOk. So what is the game?\n\nYou start off with one character, yours. and then Hire more henchmen as you gain Dirty and Clean money.\nYou'll build Speakseasy's and smuggle beer and liqour in to supply them to turn a profit. You'll have to take over NPC businesses by raiding them or having your businesses put them outta business.   Also taking over rival gangs buildings.\nAll while amassing wealth, guns, and more supplies.\n\nAll this happening while the Police catch on to you over time with the Heat system. But luckily you can hire Hitment class Henchmen to perform actions without gaining heat. And you can also bribe the Sheriff and Politicians to lower Heat and bust your henchmen outta jail.\n\nBuild special buildings that turn your Dirty money into Clean money. Lower heat. Other special buildings that automatically send Hitsquads out to attack your enemies.\n\nThere is a TON of synergy with how you can build. And thats not just because a Distillery supplies a Nightclub. Many buildings often have their own bonuses. Bookkeepers will give a bonus to Boxing arenas because of the implied betting and fixed fights (there's no option for this. its just an explanation of the idea of the bonus). Or you can build a Lawyers office that gives a bonus to the Accountant building that helps you're money laundering. Etc.\n\nBattle system? Well your henchmens class is kind of determined on what weapons they are using.\nShotguns shoot in a wide cone, as do Tommy Guns. But Tommy Guns often cause you're enemies to Panic because of the Courage system in the game. Too much damage to your HP and/or Courage and you're henchmen will lose Action Points (for how many times you can shoot or use an ability per turn) and Movement Points (Obviously, affects how you can move in battle).  Other weapons like Knives, Baseball Bats, Katana's (Yes Katana's..), Machine Guns (Different than Tommy Guns), Flame Throwers, Sniper Rifles, Semi-Automatic Pistols, Dual Revolvers... And probably more..  Each with their own affects in battle, and own abilities.  Giving a WIDE range of tactical freedom.\n\nCombat is fun. To put it short.\nEven funner is visiting local Crime Lords to buy special weapons of what I mentioned above. Giving weapons anywhere from 10-30% extra damage. Reducing AP cost of actions by 1 point per action. Increasing Critical Strike Chance. Making the cone of damage or range of your weapons greater.. Just so much.\n\nAnd even more after the battle is leveling your Henchmen up to a max level of 12. Picking perks each time they level. Increasing their stats, their Critical Chance/Damage.\n\nReally the weakest part of this game is that I wish it gave more freedom over buildings. And I wish those buildings had more functions. I wish there was bolder features to some buildings. I also wish they would have done more detailed features like Gangsters did where you could Kidnap and Assassinate certain gang members. The game really just needs more Cloak and Dagger to it.\n\nBut it's still a great game. Pick it up on sale. Play a few games. Take over the city. Its a very underrated game, in my book. Wish we could get more Mobster/Mafia sims. This one does a solid job to the genre.","June 26, 2014","true","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They continued the use of Tropico's engine (which is great in theory), but after about an hour or so one has just about done everything which can be done, thanks to the limited range of possible businesses and small maps, unlike Tropico. From then onwards all it's about is maximising efficiency with regards to where you buy and sell resources (beer, liquor, firearms, etc.) and ensuring you expand quicker than the rival gang(s). This was my main gripe, although there are a lot of other aggravating design decisions like a complete lack of logistics besides being able to buy main gang members cars, a complete waste of how nice the game looks by making literally nothing worth looking at on the ground aside from gang members moving around and civilians walking the streets, and absolutely horrid turn-based combat, similar to X-Com in how it generally runs but much, much worse, with the cheesiest action/thriller music I've heard in a recently released game.

The campaign does a good job of focusing the player through various restrictions and objectives, ensuring that missions offer different experiences and challenges and forcing the player to vary their style.\n\nThe area in which the game really shines is combat. The player has access to a variety of characters and their performance in combat is quite diverse thanks to the effect of attributes, perks, abilities and weapons. While some of the battles towards the end of the campaign seem almost impossible, it is very satisfying to learn through trial and error and finally get a win against the odds.\n\nThe sandbox mode exposes some of the flaws of the game, but the campaign mode is long enough to get good value out of the game. There is also DLC if it really captures your imagination.\n\nWell worth a go.","March 22, 2014","true","21.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That makes it a lot slower paced, but not in a bad or good way - just in a "this isn't XCOM" way, which might not be what you're looking for.\n\nFor me, it's just right and I actually really enjoy playing. The combat is strategic (albeit starter guns feel almost based on random chance to hit sometimes) especially after you start buying better weapons and getting new henchmen - and the town gameplay takes a good amount of planning to get down right and is addictive somehow. The actual combat is actually challenging on a good level at times too - while in XCOM you either get through super easy or it's just TOO difficult.\n\nI recommend it if you don't mind a slower paced strategy game and like the mob - otherwise, just get XCOM if you want a lot of action and not much else or are more into sci-fi than mafia stuff. Both are great games, but they are for different audiences.","February 2, 2013","true","22.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

The problem is it waivers between too slow while you wait for the resources you need and constantly keep re-bribing cops and starting over. The game would probably have been much more fun if, like The Godfather (the first game), you built up your criminal empire over time. Instead, you build up your current city of nowhere, do the few "story" missions which will give you some combat, reach some sort of resource goals, and start over.\n\nWithout the pleasure of really developing, the city/empire building feels completely hollow.\n\nThe combat is better, but it is still a significant step down from something like XCOM. At least if ou were doing it more, it would feel more important. The cover system seems rather flakey about always helping you rather than making you just crouch at a strange point. Combat also feels to draw out especially if a single baddie is hiding in some corner somewhere and you have to track it down.\n\nI admit to not making it to the part of the game where you can actually build structures and the like, but it was just so boring that I didn't care to continue. And why would you play a game that's boring anyway? There are better games for anything you would be looking for here.","December 8, 2013","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Building up your own gang and taking over the city. All with turn-based combat similar to X-Com. I desperately wanted to like this game as it ticks all of the strategy boxes that I like. Unfortunately, the disappointment began immediately upon release as the price was ridiculously high. I have finally got a steam code for a reasonable price and picked up the DLC cheap on here so I can actually play it for myself.\n\nAt first, it seemed quite interesting. A small tutorial area guides you through the basic concepts, including taking over businesses, building up your gang, and combat. Once this has been achieved, the story takes you into your first full area where you are let loose on your own. You have an overall objective that will advance the story but are free to investigate the rest of the area at will. Unfortunately, this is where the limited appeal of the game starts to become apparent. Although there seems to be plenty to do, none of it is particularly interesting. You send a gang member off on a job and then get a text report back as to whether they succeeded or not. Occasionally, a job will result in combat and this is the only bit where the game actually shines. The turn-based combat is excellent and makes good use of strategic cover. If the game was purely this (and cost a lot less) I would have no hesitation in recommending it.\n\nThis seems to have been envisaged as a combination of Tropico and X-Com, which is an admirable intention as they are both excellent series. Unfortunately, it pales next to both of them. I would strongly recommend taking the money you were thinking of spending on this and buying Tropico 4 and/or X-Com: Enemy Unknown as they are both infinitely more enjoyable.","December 24, 2013","false","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A small crew (starting with 3, capping out at 6) operates around a particular segment of the city, working their way into local businesses, strangling the cash flow and occasionally shooting up other mobsters.\n\nThe city management element of the game is a fairly simple juggle of three resources (beer, liquor, firearms), two types of money (dirty and clean) and police attention (gained by doing more of the things that get you the aforementioned items).  While I enjoyed seeing the city turn through its day-night cycle, the interaction was shallow and repetitive.  The best means of expansion across the urban setting is to reveal all local businesses via informants (who can be asked, forced or paid to do so), set up a supply chain of materials (a brewery to make beer, for instance, and a bar to consume it) and wait for the money to trickle in.\n\nAnd wait.\n\nAnd wait some more...\n\nIn the interim, you can harass local businesses for immediate rewards, but these come with diminished income options and lots of police attention - which is the one way to attain a Game Loss state.  If the police meter tops out, the investigators come a-knockin'.  They can be paid off (the fee doubles each time), you can throw another business under the bus (worsening relations with all goods providers), call in a favor from a bribed official (if one was buttered-up prior) or you can engage in a single combat encounter to try and destroy the evidence.  Fail to provide one of these, and the game ends.\n\nBut the waiting gets silly.  There is a fine point where your income and expenses are evenly matched and you're racing the margin curve to watch your influence spread across the town... But once you have it all, there's nothing to do with it.  Just watch the money numbers go higher as your Hotels and Casinos roll in totally legit *cough* moneys into your grubby coffers.\n\nBut wait! The game features a turn-based combat mechanic with your squadmates! (whom you pay to retain every morning in-game).  There is a decent amount of attention to the environments, and your fragile mobsters will have to make good use of cover to avoid gut-shredding volleys of lead from your opposition.\n\nThe interface is a mixed bag; on one hand, if you set a travel path for your character to take, the game helpfully counts out the steps (in Movement Points), tells you when an intersecting line of sight for an opponent comes up and displays available abilities cleanly; But then the camera obscures critical cover or registers a movement point for a character on the WRONG FLOOR and sends a goon running out into the open, making for a flight of stairs he won't reach for three turns!\n\nThe gunplay is vicious, as enemies and allies both have shallow HP pools and guns do what guns do best.  There are also knives, brass knuckles and baseball bats, but it takes a truly hardy character to withstand being shot to death by four opponents before their next turn.\n\nIt's disappointing that a game with good intentions for its environments does so little to help you customize or get to know your team.  There is a levelling mechanic (but in the campaign the level-ups are event-locked to missions, not combat encounters) wherein every level allows for a team member to grab a new perk.  These range from increasing core stats to raising critical chances and giving new abilities.  Of course, seeing as your henchmen never get stronger on their own, a single combat mistake can send your veteran to jail or the morgue.  Oh, there are also persistent injuries, wherein your character might lose half of their stamina bar or move at 1/3 normal rate.  No punches pulled here, folks.\n\nWhile you can purchase new weapons in the game and assign one to any given character, there is no cosmetic change on the models and the weapons lack flavor within their subclass; By this I mean that while I greatly appreciate 'the revolver' actually being two separate pistols, able to retalliate at the first shot fired and spray lead in a cone as a special attack (a great touch of flavor!), any one revolver behaves like any other, be it a common or a unique weapon.\n\nAnd as many reviews have pointed out, the game simply gets boring.  There is little incentive to advance within the story, except to discover how the various buildings you can set up in the city can synergize - or how snipey a Sniper can become, given enough accuracy and critical perks.\n\nBut this game simply fails to inspire.  It looks nice, but it's far more shallow than one would hope.\n\nWhile it's worth a look at a discount or a bundle, I only managed to enjoy about 5 hours of its mechanics (not counting the plodding tutorial) and the rest was spent holding my breath for more.  Eventually my lungs collapsed and I died.  But then I got better and regretted the time spent not breathing.","January 30, 2014","false","91.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I just can't say that this game is not enjoyable at all, because it is, although it is over-complicated, the atmosphere and setting, the graphics, the voice acting, everything is done with great attention to details in order to immerse you into the infamous era of prohibition. The controls are rather easy to pick up (especially if you use a controller) and the first levels get you going pretty fast. The turn-based combat is probably the biggest caveat of this game. It wants to be so much like X-Com, but just ends up being a huge pain in the rear with no real tactical options as some cover is just purely ignored and you can shoot through walls. To be fair, these encounters are not hard to beat and you are better of NOT to use the auto-resolve button.\nSo truly and honnestly, Omerta is a good game that just aims to combine too many genres, but still has a charm of its own and manages to keep you entertained for quite a while.

Once you get your economy rolling, there's very little that can stop you. All of the "rival" gangsters are passive.

They chip your AP with each hit, do heavy damage, and have decent HP.\n\nAll in all, a decent game with a simple easy to learn interface that suffers from lack of challenge.","February 1, 2013","false","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Not a flawless title, by any means. I was dissapointed how this developer handled the tropico series into 2-3, but they seemed to have learned a few lessons about what people enjoy in their games, and this game has a Kalypso media feel to it through and through. To describe the gameplay would be a mishmash of money management and tactical combat. To describe the money management, (a large part of the game) you essentially have zero expenses day to day, save gang wages, so there is no expenditures screen to ponder over. That said, bribery is a common element, and your primary expense to get da cops off your back. As for the combat, comparing it to Xcom is a bit unfair, and frequently brought up in reviews. It's more like jagged alliance, if that is at all fair. Gangsters have weapons, 3 abilities per weapon, move, whack, so on and so forth. It's straightforward, if a bit clunky. It feels like in a small way the combat was an afterthought, but combined with the streamlined money management bit, makes this a pretty decently fun title. :D","January 31, 2013","true","17.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is interesting, though hardly revolutionary, and the setting and atmosphere are absolutely fantastic. Granted, I'm a big fan of mafia-type stories or stories involving secret organizations in general. And the gameplay can be fun for a while as you try to expand your criminal business. But there's one big, overwhelming flaw to this game: it's damned near impossible to lose. You don't face competition from rival mobs, and the few obstacles you face are a joke. It got to the point where my biggest worry was whether I would have enough time to build all the buildings I wanted before I inevitably won. I don't need the game to be the next Dark Souls, but a little challenge can make victory feel very rewarding. As it stands, victory just feels cheap.\nOverall, while this game can be fun for a while, it eventually gets tiring to start up a new level and the only worry on your mind is whether you'll win too quickly. If you really love the prohibition-era setting and stories involving old-school organized crime, then you might find it worth it to pick up this game if it's on sale for 5 dollars. Otherwise, I'd give it a pass, though it breaks my heart to say it.","April 18, 2015","false","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And i was not in any way disappointed.\n\nThis is a nice little game (and yes it has some drawbacks, but which game dosnt?), campaign is somewhhat easy but sandbox is where its at, you can set a goal to reach for victory and then set the level of police and competition. This is where the game shines, once you start earning some money, the line between shooting up the competition to take over places and keeping the heat low enough so as not to attract police attention will keep you on your toes.\nAnd to the notion that you cannot lose, turn police and competition up to full, and put yourself to the test, im betting you wont win the first game, or the tenth.\n\nSadly however, even sandbox can be limited once you start to push back the competition (although he will continue to fight even when he dosnt own any businesses and is not generating money, and can become quite vicious). Once he is dead you own the city, and thats it. A nice feature would be the ability to expand into other cities once you have taken it over and compete against those you have been trading with.\n\nIts basically an indie version of The Godfather II Game with bonuses for running certain businesses (money laundeering, speakeasy etc.) and 'perk' type buildings such as the security firm (must be purchased with clean, not dirty money), which generates goons to protect your buildings.\nSo if you like that and gangster movies etc. definitly pick this bad boy up, try to grab it on sale tho, as its one for the library, but not the main one in it.","March 7, 2015","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The combat mechanics are more interesting, but seem somewhat broken, with a particularly erratic AI at times.\nAll that aside, the game is essentially boring and I felt I had got all I was going to out of the game after a few of hours of play.

You play an overly simplified city builder for half an hour, interrupted every once in a while by "tactical" combat which requires no real thought or planning. After you win, you repeat this again a dozen times until the campaign ends.\n\nFor the city builder portion, a quarter of the buildings are so situational that you will never actually build them in the campaign. Another quarter is so clearly inferior to your other choices that you have to wonder why you would build them except for the missions that restrict you from constructing the better buildings.\n\nThe only progression you have in the game is the perks you get when your gangsters level and the weapons they can buy during the missions. Unfortunately the game handles this too poorly to actually make you feel like you're making any progress. Many of the perks offer only small numerical bonuses, while the good perks don't even really matter since you can almost always just shoot your way through a mission as long as you don't make any obviously bad tactical decisions. The weapons carry over through the campaign, but if you want them you'll end up just waiting in a mission long after you've won, just to make money to buy them. Later you can sell all the extra crap weapons you've bought to try and speed up the missions so I guess that's something.\n\nThe story which is the best part of the game, is fairly charming but wouldn't stand out if the rest of the game wasn't so poor. And this is a massive problem as the tiny chunks of plot each mission doles out, is almost unbearable for the repetitive gameplay that you put up with in the campaign.","January 30, 2015","false","25.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Omerta is like a 4X (ok, maybe a 3X) for gangsters.  Build your empire, steal some cars, find ways to hamstring your oponents, and occasionally pop into a turn-based tactical game like XCOM, except with mobsters.  Both the empire building and tactical elements of the game are fun, but nothing is perfect.  First, I enjoyed the sandbox mode immensely more than most of the story campaigns.  The campaigns prescribed far to much... "go take over *that* speakeasy", "go hunt for a witness right now", "boss fred needs you to x immediately" "ok, you finished this scenario eventhough you haven't done all that much, start over on the next map".  Ugh.  Sandbox on the other hand you can grow where and how you want and you can grow all the way to the end game.  Additionally, to maybe add some additional challenge, some of the end-campaign tactical fights are practically un-winnable.  Your team is limited, but the enemy can spawn a dozen or so high-powered units around and behind you as you are on your way "out".

They continued the use of Tropico's engine (which is great in theory), but after about an hour or so one has just about done everything which can be done, thanks to the limited range of possible businesses and small maps, unlike Tropico. From then onwards all it's about is maximising efficiency with regards to where you buy and sell resources (beer, liquor, firearms, etc.) and ensuring you expand quicker than the rival gang(s). This was my main gripe, although there are a lot of other aggravating design decisions like a complete lack of logistics besides being able to buy main gang members cars, a complete waste of how nice the game looks by making literally nothing worth looking at on the ground aside from gang members moving around and civilians walking the streets, and absolutely horrid turn-based combat, similar to X-Com in how it generally runs but much, much worse, with the cheesiest action/thriller music I've heard in a recently released game.

I had high hopes. Kalypso makes the Tropico series and I really like those games. But here is where it ends. I kept playing because I WANTED to like this game I WANTED to play until I liked it. I wanted it to be worth my time. I wanted too much...\n\nPros:\nThis is an easy strategy game.\nGreat for casual players... Kind of...\nThe turn based combat is simple...\n\nCons:\nAI is abysmal.\nBalance is nonexistent.\nEconomic side is dumbed down to facebook level.\nEquipment is impossible to get what you want.\nLet‚Äôs just say the cons are the game seems like the alpha of the game was released where they were just trying to figure out what they were trying to do... Then never came back and finished the game and released the first almost playable concept...\n\nLet‚Äôs start with character development. There is an attempt at it. It is not based on combat, kills, damage, jobs/missions, or anything that should cause your character to increase. The only thing that triggers level advancement or character progress is certain pre-scripted missions that grant you a level. This dumbs down progression and makes it anti-climactic and tedious. No matter if I play a level completely through conquer all the properties and finish every detail, or do the bare minimum it does not change the character development. This is obnoxious.\n\nEquipment is like an afterthought in this game. You have 1 slot for 1 weapon. That is it. 1 slot. You can equip a single weapon. No body armor, med kits, or any of a countless other standard fare in these games. No switching between primary and secondary weapons. You get ONE weapon. And most of what you are offered is baseball bats and knives to fight people with tommy guns and flame throwers. For every three melee weapons I was offered a ranged weapon. And most levels (streets) allow you to buy 0-3 weapons. There are no equipment drops during combat. You find yourself quickly using pistols and revolvers and melee weapons against much more powerful items. Seriously, the balance on weapons is non-existent, but helps balance the poor AI.\n\nThe AI is horrific. Some missions you swear they are scripted and others if they can't see you or your target, they don't get to move. I have had combat where I have two enemies with a divider wall between them in a U shaped room. As I moved I spotted both but I am obscured from the one and he is not in my direct line of sight. They are less than 10 move from each other. I shoot the exploding barrel next to my target as it was both his cover and a way to do more damage. The fire crosses the divider immediately and will soon start the hidden character on fire. He doesn‚Äôt spot me yet. What? I shot the barrel in front of him and he is on fire and does not get to act??? I shoot and miss, still oblivious. I shoot and hit with my final shot and miraculously he spots me. End turn. He runs further INTO the fire and shoots at me from there with a flame thrower‚Ä¶ Ok, ironic and a bit funny‚Ä¶ I am now on fire, he is on fire the fire he is standing in is spreading. The guy on the other side of the divider doesn‚Äôt come out. My turn, I move back to cover and shoot at him until I am out of actions. His turn he stays where he is and tries to flame me again. Still waiting, the other guy does not get an action. I take him out finally. One of my other character gets in position and the other guy was just standing in the flames like nothing was wrong. Awesome AI!!!!\n\nYour economic side is deciding which prefab buildings to rent or attack and rent or buy out‚Ä¶ And set up enterprises to make money. You can‚Äôt build more. You can‚Äôt upgrade sites. You get a category per site with set selections and then you can ‚Äúimprove‚Äù the selected business. Or you can buy residential and a small house, apartment, or factory all cost $1000 and make you $80. No balance, logic, reason, or anything. You have limited choices and it plays like a phone app or facebook game.\n\nHeat is how much the police have noticed your criminal activity. And it doesn‚Äôt matter if you are running legitimate businesses only or criminal ones you are going to gain heat just for existing. I have tried even going as far as not owning anything, not running a single mission, and just sitting there. And yes, even if you do NOTHING and own NOTHING the heat level increases. It appears to have a minimum increase over time with modifiers depending on mission.\nI so wanted to like this game. But alas Jagged Alliance I was better and Jagged Alliance II blew the doors off of this game. Kalypso, please finish this game‚Ä¶ or at least advance it to BETA from the playable concept you released‚Ä¶\n","January 28, 2015","false","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In essense, this is another game that I would do better in person.  The combat system is what kills this game.  Last I knew, you don't don't even need courage to fire a gun, just need to be alive.  I feel bad for those who cannot hack the game in other to be able to see the ending.  You also won't get to play without creating an account.  Kalypso's now in my pile of "Undesirable Gaming Companies to Avoid At All Cost" along with Rockstar, UbiSoft, if I would do better in person, if I need to create an account and login to play and you ain't smart enough to build a proper difficulty function for a game, you suck as human being and don't deserve my money.\n\nThe Good:\nThis is a fun game I don't care what anyone says though, if you have cheats or a trainer.  I was skeptical at first despite the gross amount of negative reviews.  Ok it is a bit dated for this time but 2D will likely never die; because of its simplicity.  If you're looking for a Mafia type game that is very hands off but does has some basic (but odd) combat, this game is for you.  If anything it is a management game.  I played this game thinking it would never install, start or the game would be so terrible that even the biggest game douches couldn't possibly find fun.  I did though, this a great time killer.  It's not an alternative or a replacement for Mafia II but is a fun little time killer.  The hassle is little and once you get the hang of it, you'll want to explore the heck out of it.  Great setting, I love the atmosphere, feels like home.\n\nI hope they make an actual RPG game out of this, a sequel, maybe to even actually rival Mafia II... we need more Italian Mafia related games!!  If I do not rake in more hours on this than Mafia II I would be surprised.  Repetitive, simple, brainless and addictive but without a trainer I would have gien up and asked for a refund long ago.  So unless you want to spent money to see the ending then I would suggest staying away.  As said earlier, the only real downfall is the battle system and camplaign system, it never feels like you have the chance to do as as much as you want but there are many missions.  I find is rather stupid but in a way recreates reality well enough.  The more you go, the easier things get, make sure you chose the best possible support unit as support and it's a good idea to do full respecs when you have lots of money.  The ambiance, atmosphere and management wins this game.  I have yet to try the sandbox, I want to finish the story first.... it is so captivating!\n\nThe Bad:\nIt is rather dated for its time, built in 2013 and mostly 2D.  The map is odd to work with, it's either angular or straight which can get confusing.  All maps essentially look the same, kinda like a "small maps but big buildings" Sim City.  This would have benefited from a 3D universe but then those devs aren't that good; I wouldn't ask that much from them.  Thsi game starts from:\n\n1- This is so cool!\n2- Those battles are stupid\n3- Managing a Mafia is fun though\n4- Wow, I'm getting better at battles\n5- I never have enough premises!!\n6- Making money is rather easy for a mafia\n7- Whoa-ho!!  Looks at this shotgun!!\n8- Ok, this is getting repetitive now but not in a bad way\n9- Clean money helps keep the heat low\n10- Why are those maps soo small?\n11- I never have enough contruction lots!!\n12- Wow, how can you miss 7 point blank shots in a row, best gun in the game, best guy weilding\n13- You know, I do a lot better in real life\n14- Games like this are why I cheat\n15- I never have enough distilleries!!\n\n... and the list goes on but I want to get back to playing.\n\nThe Ridiculous:\nI think it's been said everywhere already but I will add on.  After you pass Michigan Ave and get around the Boardwalk, the game gives you no chance.  I have been gaming for decades and this battle system is the worst I ever seen.  It is turn based but not well made... turn based worst if it is well made, this is not.  On top of that, your own hits only land 40% where the enemy hits 75% of the time.  If i was running an arcade, I would lvoe this game because the house always wins.  I'm starting to think of opening an arcade and put up all the games that are made to never be won by normal means.  Instead of making an enjoyable game, with a normal difficulty curve and a normal XP point distribution, this would have been an A+ game that people would talk about... but no developers makes games for themselves then wonder why they get so many refunds and so many negative reviews; stuck up sods!\n\nThe zoom never zooms out enough, I like seeing the whole city from a zoom out position.  The little map helps but I prefer a further zoom.  Another problem is that they stuck quest items in spots that are near impossible to get to, lots of blind spots make this game hard to deal with.  Battles also never really tell you how many enemies there are.  There is nothing to really heal yoruself, if there is you can only use it once per mission.\n\nI am running Windows 7 with XP support on an ultra spec 2013 laptop... Like a boss XD\n\nIf you're a fan of anything Italian Mafia, it's definitely worth a buy below $10; I got it for a lot less, so it was the best $5 I spent in 2015 on a game and I bu ya lto of $5 games, I don't keep them all though, this one, I will play again once I finish it.  Been about 40 hours now, taking my sweet ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, dora the explora time; so it is longer to complete than Mafia II which I can complete in less than a day now.\n\nPS: Yes, I do cheat games that take away from the enjoyment.  If I feel the developer is cheating with his code, I can cheat with mine and make us equal, so I can enjoy the game.  There are challenges I can go without but in this game, there are too many variables added that shouldn't be there anyways.  The game was made too tight, I loosen it up a bit.  I use a trainer for unlimited health.\n\nConclusion: I recommend this game only if you have access to cheats or a trainer; which is sort of like a game genie.  I would recommend getting a membership with a trainer provider since so many games today aren't well made.  I'm an old school gamer and expect old school values in the games I buy... that's why I have not yet purchased TW3, they don't sell a full game on release.  Pre-Orders and DLC's are new school.... this game is new school, trying to be old school.  Don't wonder why this is rated so low everywhere on the internet.  People love this game but hate the way it was built.","December 2, 2015","true","122.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/208520/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Omerta - City of Gansters is a strategy. Or management game. Or at least it combines real-time management, using turn-based combat to settle conflicts. And as you guessed it, it's about running small mafia business, made by Haemimont Games and Kalypso and released in 2013. It also was ported to Xbox 360.\n\nApparently, this game was release in quite swallow state at first. For examples, from what I know, you couldn't have use cars and there were no enemy gang in sandbox, which will explain to you why the game was recieved negatively. Or maybe there wasn't sandbox at all, I wasn't there. Thankfully, developers actually listened and actually improved the game. Though, I bet that it mostly came by back-porting new stuff introduced in Japanese Incetive expansion pack DLC into base game.\n\nTechnically, bugs occasionally pop up. Like, sometimes the game progress in combat will freeze after enemies used fire bomb, making the turn last forever. Or on strategy map my boss avatar on car decided that he can take his sweet time setting Speakeasy and then drove off the map and back. Twice. There were strange lag spikes in sandbox too.\n\nMultiplayer community seems to be completely dead. Nobody in chat, no games to be found. Hm, maybe that's because I don't have Japanese Inciative DLC.\n\nThe plot of this game takes during Prohibition Era in USA, as your avatar fled there in a chase after a wild goose that is American Dream. Now your mission is to become a ganster and parasite on society, ruining otherwise good-spirited idea of prohibition. Buying out everything in each part of city and doing it again. And then win. And then prohibition era will end, your business will dissapear, you will end up in jail for tax evasion and you will get heart attack from shaaaame.\nNo, I didn't beat whole campaign. And obvious Mario references are obvious.\n\nFor single-player, here is campaign and sandbox modes. In campaign you have to complete separate levels, the only thing that carries over is your gang and half of Fear and Liked amount. In each mission you have to fulfill a certain objectives to win. And the first half of a game is real-time mangament. And you will see why people compare it to Facebook games - there are no rival gangs. No time speed function, you have to click on character portrait once his order is done, you spend time waiting for things to happen as nothing goes wrong, usually. Wouldn't say that this is Facebook gameplay though, you can still screw up a bit and it doesn't feel as pointless as F games.\n\nYou also still have to watch out for police. You will be getting attention if you order something criminal, like burgary, and you will get their attention slowly even if you do nothing. Albeit there are buldings that will reduce this effect. So while criminal things may give you a quick effect, you want to stay as legal as possible. The problem is that in campaign there are no rival gang or anything to pressure you, so sadly there is no real choice and no reason to go dirty.\n\nYou just set up even most basic production and then the question from "will I win?" goes to "how soon will I win?".\n\nFor handling conflicts, you got turn-based combat. Four of your guys against any number of baddies. It's probably good, there are a lot of good stuff implented. It shows only what your mobs can see. There are useful features like icon which shows who this characters sees. Game shows icon on path that you set which point at spots where enemies can fire at them. Cover system is also neat, but remember that runn out in the open is sometimes a better idea to overwhelm enemy. Or that every enemy has three abilities. Wasting one point for aiming. Melee characters keep movement points after action. Neat stuff, as said.\nThough in the end, everybody will be bleeding.\n\nSadly, they also have very weak presentation here. Visuals and soundtrack here are weak and pretty much no special effects. It's like they don't want you to have a blast on purpose. I am not fanatic of old PC strategies like this to enjoy such approach. Oh, by the way, management side has nice music, I think it consist of licensed tracks.\n\nSandbox mdoe on other hand went extreme into another way. You now have a rival gang now and this AI is so agressive, you will keep being dominated. I heard that it was a very late addition in latest patch. I am not sure if AI cheats, but it's probably just way too good, especially when player can't slow down time in management half to issue orders. There is only way to victory - grab money and try to build Security Agency on Construction slots which will automatically generate gangs to defend your buildings, while you also should do "wetworks" missions for crime lord to level your chars and get money. And only after getting Security Agency you will be secured from losing the game and can slowly struggle to take over businesses that surround you from the hands of enemy gang. Until you finally get recources to take on his hideout and get some anti-climax poor fight and be a winner.\n\nSounds challenging, but having only one way to possibly win isn't too fun either.\n\nAs for multiplayer, it was only about turn-based combat. Either coop or versus. I didn't get to play a single match, sadly.\n\nAnd I am not sure what to think of this game. It's not exactly awful and you can enjoy it slowly. But eh, nothing to excite me. Absolutely nothing. Then again, I am not fan of such genres or settings. Why did I get this game? Oh, right, Tropico 5 pre-order bonus.","January 19","true","18.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I got all the DLC too but haven't looked into them too much because of how weak the main game is, maybe my opinion will change in time but even for the style and look of this game 30$ is asking too much to be frank.","June 27, 2015","false","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But after a couple of hours, you've really seen all there is to see, and the rest is just iteration.  It may have some lasting appeal, but there's just not enough of the management game to keep you coming back through different scenarios like there is in other Kalypso games like the Tropico series.  I think it's a good buy, but probably not at $40.  I'd wait for the price to get around $20 before jumping in.","February 10, 2013","false","10.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
