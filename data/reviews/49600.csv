Jumping right in, you'll probably die horribly right out of the gate, but the game has a perk and progression feature that allows you to enhance your abilities as you go along.\n\nThere are also in-game power-ups, which enhance the ever-important score multiplier, upgrade your weapons, and give you lovely bombs to destroy entire screens of swarming enemy ships. There's even a power-up that will increase the volume of the music you select.\n\nAnd that, the music, is the real draw of games like this, that depends on your personal investment with your music library to add an additional level of investment on the part of the player. While this may feel somewhat emotionally manipulative at times, I'm not going to knock the game for tricking me into enjoying it.\n\nLevels seem to match up to the music you're playing if you squint a bit. There's also a photosensitive seizure warning included at the start of the game, and with all the bright flashing colors and neon streaks of light firing everywhere, that's an appropriate warning. The visuals themselves may not be to your personal taste, though they're executed well, with a decent variety of different enemy types to shoot down.\n\nUltimately, Beat Hazard fulfills a need I didn't even know I had; the need to murder waves of enemies while Sara Bareilles croons at me to say I'm sorry for what I've done. I'm sorry, okay? I'm so sorry. Please stop sending these giant worm monsters after me.","March 23, 2014","true","33.7"," 117 of 121 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","117","121","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jedo/recommended/49600/","jedo","Black Mage Jedo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jedo/","3564 products in account","Beat Hazard (along with the DLC) is one of the few games that I fully appreciate. It's definitely up there as far as quality twin-stick shooters go. There are just so many things that make this game good.\n\nPlay your own music - This was the very first 'play your own music' game that I got on Steam. It's not the most special feature on Beat Hazard but it's the main reason I enjoyed it as a twin-stick shooter. I don't have a lot of experience in the genre so being able to play on my own pace depending on the song used was a major positive factor for me.\n\nDifficulty Adjustment - The difficulty is easily adjustable in a multitude of ways. You have your conventional difficulty settings (easy, etc, etc). Then you have visual intensity which to me is somewhat of a visual handicap (with benefits of course). Two other ways to adjust difficulty would be by picking songs with varied intensities or by playing with the new DLC content which adds ship customization complete with stats. In a game with this many options, it won't matter what skill level you are within the genre. It's still very possible to feel a small sense of accomplishment even as a casual player.\n\nMusic Discovery - In this day and age, I no longer listen to the radio unless I'm really bored while driving from location A to B. Beat Hazard allows you to play while listening to various radio stations (custom or default added). In all honesty, I have discovered a ♥♥♥♥ ton of music during the few months that I have been really into Beat Hazard.\n\nThere's a lot more things that make Beat Hazard a wonderful game. For the sake of simplicity, I merely listed 3 of my favorite reasons.\n\n10/10\n\nIt's nearly impossible to get bored in this game.","April 22, 2014","true","30.9"," 60 of 67 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","60","67","0","0"

When you combine twin-stick shooter mechanics with intense music-driven gameplay, you get Beat Hazard. Everything from the explosions to the type of enemies you encounter are all affected by the beat of the music. There's more to it as well. You can collect power-ups, get multipliers to increase your score and, of course, you can use your own music (You have to buy iTunes support, but it's only a dollar, so literally a small price to pay). You can also rank up and get perks that can give you a leg-up to shooting up the leaderboards. And then there's the DLC (Ultra and Shadow Operations) which add new ships, enemies, missions (getting [x] amount of points or completing [x] amount of songs on a certain difficulty) and even Steam Workshop support, letting you download even more ships and missions. Pausing's a little weird, however; with an Xbox 360 controller you have to press both Start and Back to pause. Other than that, this is easily one of the best music-driven games I've played. If you're tired of Audiosurf and want something different, this is for you.\n\nA word of warning, however: There are LOTS of flashing lights and visuals in this game (it even warns you when you start the game). So if you suffer for photosensitive seizures or the like, then you should avoid this game (Then again, if you suffer from such a condition, you shouldn't be playing games in the first place).","October 6, 2014","true","5.8"," 33 of 36 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","33","36","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/geoluz/recommended/49600/","geoluz","GeoLuz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/geoluz/","180 products in account","I have played Audiosurf for a long time and I was not sure if Beat Hazard was a game that could stand out for me as a music-based game. I finally decided to give Beat Hazard a try after it was available for several years on the market. It feels like a game inspired by the classic game Asteroids, but with songs from your music library playing while you control your spaceship. So the basic premise of the game is you maneuvering a spaceship while avoiding asteroids and many enemy spaceships of varying types and sizes. There are many games of this genre in a crowded market, but Beat Hazard carves out its own identity with its challenging action and allows you to take on numerous enemies and other hazards as you enjoy the rhythm of the songs of your favorite artists and built-in songs.\n\nThere had been criticism of Beat Hazard because of the lack of iTunes support. I strongly recommend buying the related Beat Hazard DLC that supports iTunes songs. I played songs from iTunes and they work just fine. The game accepts all song file types with the exception of CDs, so you will have to rip the CDs in order to play the songs. Another criticism had been that Beat Hazard doesn’t seem exciting enough on slow songs. I played many slow songs, including some pop/soft rock songs, and there is enough intensity in the visuals and the mayhem to make the gameplay exciting. It is beautiful to see your spaceship’s bright neon fire fill the screen while the explosions are so vibrant. There are times when the brightness of the visuals is a bit overdone, especially as the track progresses. When the visuals are too intense it can feel uncomfortable for those with sensitive eyes. Therefore, it would be best to take a break from the action if the flashing strobe feels overwhelming.\n\nThere are several gameplay modes in the game and many spaceships to choose from. The standard mode requires you to play through an entire track until it is finished. Survival mode requires you to last as long as possible while trying to play through an entire album. The spaceships have their own specific missions such as accumulating a minimum number of points without getting the death penalty that would nullify some or all of the points you had scored previously. These specific missions for spaceships add to the challenge of playing this old-school shooter while enjoying the rhythm of whatever song you are playing. There is a boss rush mode that requires you to defeat wave after wave of bosses until you have no more lives remaining. The bosses become familiar after experiencing the standard modes since bosses appear at specific points of the song. These modes are exciting in their own way, but it feels like there aren’t too many other modes to further increase replay value. However, there is online play that allows you to play the various modes with a friend. The bottom of the screen adds a nice touch to the game by notifying you of your progress, your friends’ progress, and other players who are looking to playing with others.\n\nYou can level up in the game and that happens as you progress through each track. After leveling up enough you will earn a new rank and you can see how you rank against other players on the global leaderboard. There is no leaderboard for individual songs like Audiosurf, but Beat Hazard’s way of leveling up provides a sense of progression. I played with the mouse and keyboard setup and it plays quite well. There is the option of playing with a controller.\n\nThere are many powerups in the game. As you pick up volume and power powerups, your spaceship’s lasers become increasingly powerful, but the gameplay will also intensify. The screen fills up with a large number of small enemy spaceships and large spaceships to balance the gameplay and keep you from being significantly overpowered.\n\nI think Beat Hazard is a fun game that some players may find old after playing through their favorite tracks in all the available modes. However, this game is definitely worth the $9.99 purchase price plus the DLCs. You can’t go wrong with game that offers enough replay value that is as large as your music collection, vibrant visuals, intense boss battles, and lots of powerups.\n\nMy Score: 7.5/10\n","September 18, 2015","true","46.3"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","17","17","0","0"

Its pretty much contained in a single screen and the game throws waves of asteroids, ships and space worms after you. Since its a dual stick shooter, the controls are easy, left stick to move, right stick to fire the direction you're aiming. There are also bombs to clear the screen when it gets completely full of enemies.\n\nBeat Hazard has a major twist. Your rate of fire is controlled by the tempo or beats per minute of the music. Not just your bullets but the enemy speed too. If you don't care for the songs that the game comes with, you can play one of your own .mp3s or listen to Internet radio. The neon laser beams make the game come to life as more than a game. It could be a visualizer for your mp3 playlist.\n\nEvery song is a level. When the song ends or your lives run out, you see your high score and the game remembers how far you got and your high score. So you can play it again for a better high score or to go further in the song. I'd much rather have the game go from song to song than force me to start up a new game for the next song. There is a survival mode that will keep going song to song, but its just a single life.\n\nThe enemy diversity shines through in the game. There are simple ships that fly in long waves. Larger ships that take more damage. Even larger ships that explode into a hail of homing missiles. Still other ships have dual repulsor beams to push you around. Magnetic ships have dual rays that pull you in. There are segmented space worms, easier to defeat neon worms. It is a varitable feast. Not just that, but diverse bosses. Everything from huge space ships, gigantic worms to star fish that coil up their tentacles for protection. These enemies will fill your screen in no time especially on the upper three difficulties. The game has a way to keep your mind engaged as to how you can survive.\n\nEvery score that you have go to your level or rank. The score is like experience. You will rank up and get to unlock a perk. You need to buy the perk once its been unlocked. Not just buy it, but buy multiples of it. Then equip it. There are perks that give you extra lives, extra bombs, and increase score multipliers. Other things that can get unlocked are extra difficulty modes for when 'hardcore' gets too easy for you.\n\nThere are other layers of complexity to the Beat Hazard such as a risk reward system. If you don't shoot a set amount of time your score multiplier goes up. If you survive long enough without dying, the multiplier goes up again. Before you know it you're at 45+ of a score multiplier if not 100+ with perks. All the while enemies will drop things for you to pickup such as extra multipliers, money, bombs to use, power ups for your laser and volume increases. Its very risk or reward. Do you leave your safe corner of the screen, navigate through the madness to get your $10?\n\nThe game is kind enough that when you die, it litters the area with items to get you back up and competing again. That is a downfall of other games that if you die late into a game, your underpowered ship is useless against the high difficulty enemies.\n\nIf you get lonely there is 2 player and online multiplayer where you compete on a single screen against someone. Not just that, but the game will notify you if someone is trying to multiplayer at that time. You can interrupt your own game to play against someone. This ensures there's always someone to play.\n\nI say this game is well worth the $10 asking price.","March 6, 2013","true","11.3"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","0"

The game not only creates new levels based on the song being played, but it syncs to the dynamics of the songs as well. Truly an amazing experiencce that also capitalizes on RPG elements in the form of buffs/perks and upgrades to said buffs/perks, in addition to having various ships to choose from as you unlock them.

WHILE YOU CAN REDUCE THE INTENSITY IN THE SETTINGS IT IS STILL WAY LARGER THAN THE NORMAL AMOUNT!\n\n[WARNING]\n\nTL;DR: Spaceship, meets star arena meet asteroid with your music providing the tempo for the weapons and enemies! Enjoyable for those who like to challenge themselves since the INSANE difficiulity is definitely insane!\n\n\nReview Starts Here\nWhat is Beat Hazard?\nBeat hazard is a 2D top down space shooter game in the veins of asteroid except you have enemies and boss fights. Pretty darn awesome. You have to supply it with your music though.\n\n1:Graphics\nNotice the [WARNING] thing above? well not kidding. Each effects is the same as a single flashbang and every shots and explosion from either you or the enemy will sear the screen as bright as the sun causing temperorary blindness and mania in the affected gamers. God forbid you crank up the effect to 200% like i did and played for 30 min straight.\n\nThe actual graphics themselves are very good as far as 2D spaceshooting game is concern. Sprite move, shoot and explode brilliantly when they die. Meanwhile the 3D effects zoom across the screen blinding you with their colourful effects. And they are bright.\n\n2: Sound\nShooting sounds good, explosive sounds good.\nFor anything else music, you supply it yourself.\n\n3:Gameplay\nYou get 2 meter, power and volume meter, collecting powerup increases either the bar game which in turn either increases your shot power or shot intensity respectively. Mostly you want the intensity though because depending on the music the AI can really prove to be a challenge with them swarming you on all side so breaking through will definitely help more.\n\nAt the start of the game you are provided with 3 bombs that clear HALF the map of enemies and not the whole map. If you die a bomb would automatically be used should one be in your possesion.\n\nPerks can be purchase with cash you collect as you destroy craft but only a limited number can be activated at time, they provide in game benefits when you activate them.\n\nAs you play along the game sometimes boss can appear, these hulking monstrosity often has a gimmick behind thier sleeves that can prove to be rather challenging if you are terrible with them but killing them often provides money and powerups.\n\nThe game will continue till the song ends so if you pick a long and beaty song at hard or above, prepare for a beating.\n\n4:Beat Hazard Ultra DLC\nCurrently there are 2 version on sale on steam, the normal edition and the one bundled with the DLC Beat Hazard Ultra. Genrally speaking, get the bundle. it includes even more bosses, more enemy types, more perk and generally more of everything that the classic beat hazard doesnt have! Also the effects are shinier in the DLC so yeah, poor retina.\n\nConclusion.\nGreat game with friends or by yourself. hopefully drunken friends that way you can play those super weird music as you blast spaceship in tune to the beat. Definitely a thumbs up.\n\n[TIPS]\nCant find a hard enough music? Insane too easy? Go use white noises as the music. Dont say i didnt warn you.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group\n\nCheck out the Original Network Groups.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dsp21/recommended/49600/","dsp21","[J7] Dsp21","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dsp21/","350 products in account","I love this game, it combines two things I've always had a passion for, music and games. This is a space shooter that depends on the beats of your own songs. The enemies and your wepoans are either faster and stronger or slower and weaker completely dependng on the song you're playing. If you like dance / eletronic music you'll probably have a harder time playing it! I've had this on the Playstation 3 system and now own it on Steam, so it's safe to say I have around 50 hours in this.\n\nI can only write about Beat Hazard Ultra, because I've only played that version so far. The Ultra DLC adds perks and weapons in which you can upgrade using in-game cash. Honestly, Beat Hazard must feel boring without the Ultra DLC, it breathes new life into the game, a damn good one!\n\nEvery DLC so far has not disappointed me (although there's only two o far), It just feels like a much better game if you have all the DLCs. Both will give you challenges and a ton of stuff to do. The new Shadow Operations Unit is also a great addition, introducing new ships and the ability of creating your own! Each ship will give you 3 challenges, in which some are actually pretty hard to complete! :D\n\nBeat Hazard is the game I'll always go back to it sometime because I'll miss its craziness and how good it feels to destroy enemy spaceships. It always feels different because everytime I go back to it, my musical taste has slightly changed. This game is cheap, and if you love music I think you'll like this game too, but be sure to, at least, get hte Ultra DLC, it will be a totally different experience. Beat Hazard (Ultra + Shadow Operations DLC) is an 8.5/10 for me, considering it an indie game and how cheap you can get it, the amount of hours you'll play this will surely not be wasted. :D","June 25, 2014","true","38.2"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kassan6ra/recommended/49600/","kassan6ra","Kassan6ra","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kassan6ra/","433 products in account","Before reading: this review is about Beat Hazard Ultra, meaning the basic game + dlc. While I still recommend Beat Hazard on its own, it is more simplistic and lacks online co-op that the Ultra version provides, so I strongly recommend this game to be played with DLC.\n\nBeat Hazard Ultra is a fast paced space shoot'em up with bright colorful graphics. At first sight it does not look like much, however it has several features that have made it one of the most pleasant surprises in my library.\n\nThe graphics look amazing at first, they tend to tire out your eyes pretty easily however, so it is not recommended to play for long sessions. There is an option to scale them up (!) or down inside the game menu though.The battle is fluid despite the abundance of color, enemies and the genral chaos that takes place on your screen especially on the higher difficulties. I have even played this on a linux netbook -yes it plays on linux and mac as well- with minimal capabilities and I was honestly surprised at its smoothness. Gameplay is fluid as well, regardless if you are playing with a controller or a mouse and keyboard. In fact, I even find myself preferring the mouse and keyboard mostly because the mouse provides more precise aiming than thumbsticks. The difficulty curve is just right, meaning you can choose from 5 different difficulty settings (easy, normal, hardcore, insane, suicidal) and play in whatever mode you feel comfortable with. This makes the game equally enjoyable for both hardcore shmup players as well as people who are new to the genre, or not particularly skilled. There is also a nice "perk" system implemented, where you can buy upgrades, such as a few special attacks, more multipliers, etc.\n\nMusic is an integral part of playing the game and your ship's power as well as enemies generated depend on the music you are playing. This means that the exact same level will be generated when you play the exact same track. When the music gets more aggressive, so will your ship's lasers, but that will also make your enemies spawn and move faster. The opposite happens when the music gets mellow. This makes the game quite interesting since it doesn't exactly mean it gets easier on mellow music or harder on heavier music, but instead it manages very successfully to keep the game balanced on either setting so you can have a go on different tracks depending on your mood. The games build in track list is fairly pleasant to play, but why limit yourself there, when you can actually index and play any song in your computer or just play listening to your favorite radio station?\n\nWhat usually disappoints in this genre is the lack of online co-op mode. Well, Beat Hazard Ultra actually HAS online co-op as well as online versus mode where you can easily invite someone over your steam friend list and play together. You can even play listening to the radio, or play your own music as well, provided both of the participants have the same track indexed.\n\nTo sum it up, if you like shmups or are just curious about the genre, you will definitely enjoy this game. For me, it is a small gem in my library, so I hope more people will discover it in the future.\n","March 16, 2014","true","56.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

[has been] invaluable in continued research” - National Epilepsy Diagnostics Foundation\n\n“A true thriller that had me shaking in my boots.. and then in my chair.. followed shortly by the floor.” - PartialSandwich\n\nTasteless epileptic jokes aside, this game is fantastic. Beat Hazard is a twin-stick bullet-mayhem shooter very much akin to the Geometry Wars franchise. While the mechanics are quite similar, Beat Hazard makes the game your own by allowing your personal music collection to generate the levels you play.\n\nThe game comes with about 20 or 30 tracks (all of which are pretty awesome) but nothing quite compares to the screen going mental when the beat drops in your favorite song. Speaking of the screen going mental, I tend to be bemused by games that put the photo-sensitivity warning before the game begins. I don’t understand the mechanics by which a seizure is induced but typically games have that warning when the only light flickering is a lamp swinging and sparking from the ceiling. Beat Hazard on the other hand means business, I have never seen such chaos in all my life!\n\nBut here is the incredible part: the developers have masterfully balanced all the elements of the game so that even amidst all the chaos you know exactly what you’re doing. It was truly baffling to me when I played my very first game. I don’t know how they pulled it off but the design of this game is top notch.

[KAMGUSTA's REVIEW]\n\nThis game is unbelievable! At first I thought it was just another Geometry Wars clone (and in a certain way, it is), but due to the fact it is totally dependent on the music you let it play (yes, you use your own music!) it competes in a different league.\nThe aim of the game is simple: enemy spacecrafts appear on the screen and you have to shoot all of them down; these will give you bonuses and powerups that will come in handy when facing the bigger and badder spacecrafts (the "end level bosses")!\nGone are the days when you had to shoot while listening an annoying soundtrack, this time you have to shoot FOR listening your favorite song! Pop, Techno, Country, every genre translates in a different gameplay.\n\nReplay value is quite high: there are lot of achievements and at easier difficulties it is a good stress relief.\nI found the blinding acid graphic not distracting at all and simply amazing: another positive point for the game. It is the best game of this type on the market.\nThe DLC is the icing on the cake, adding longevity and new enemies.\n\nBest played with X360 Joypad\nRecommended Buy Price < 15$\nScore 8/10","February 24, 2014","true","14.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The control is great (allows for keyboard or controller) and the effects are pretty amazing, very bright and colorful. Also, there are many additional ships by designers in the Workshop, so experimenting around with other people's ships (and making your own) adds to the fun. The intensity of the enemy waves increases based on difficulty level and the intensity of your music. Obviously, some genres of music will be more preferable than others.\n\nIf you're going to get this game, I highly recommend getting all the DLC. iTunes support will obviously let you play your iTunes files, Shadow Ops gives you objectives to complete in the game to raise your rank (allowing you to pick certain ships in the Workshop), and Ultra will add a wider variety of enemies (and probably other stuff, I don't know).\n\nOverall, Beat Hazard is a fun game that I keep coming back to periodically as a stress-reliever. Sometimes you just wanna blow sh*t up and listen to your favorite music, and this game does a great job of combining them both.","July 5, 2014","true","62.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

This is a really good game. It's algarythm is really solid, it's extremely easy to import your own songs, escpecially once you buy the itunes DLC, you have to pay because they had to buy the liscence to use itunes...\n\nHowever I do not recomend this game. On this page, this store page, it advertises Steam Workshop support. That is a blatent lie and false advertisement. Yes this game has Steam Workshop, no it's not included in the base game. Instead the develop is attempting to gouge more money out of you by making you pay 4.99$ for Steam Workshop. Yes you get some crappy other ships, but no one buys that DLC for the ships, they buy it for the Steam Workshop.\n\nThe shear audacity of charging money for a feature that is FREE in every other game that supports it is incredibly daring and the Developer should not be rewarded for that. Because of this shady practice I honestly can't recomend this game to anyone, you should not be aloud to put a free feature behind a pay wall, especially when it's not even your work that your making people pay for. Sure make me pay for your ship designs, but dont' make me pay for other player's ship designs.\n","November 10, 2014","false","4.5"," 58 of 110 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","58","110","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/oafdragon/recommended/49600/","oafdragon","Keggles Koko Pops","http://steamcommunity.com/id/oafdragon/","456 products in account","I played this well into the night of Christmas Eve, into the early morning of Christmas itself many years ago. I was too anxious to sleep since Santa Claus was on his way, so I opted to venture into the living room in the dead of the night while everyone else was asleep. I had just recently bought and installed Beat Hazard and decided to have a go at it. In what seemed like five or so minutes, I was hooked like I was on drugs, this game is like a combination of LSD, Cannabis, the Magic Mushrooms and all that hippy stuff that makes you see the purple rhinoceros.\n\nEventually, the computer crashed since it was a piece of junk, and I continued staring at the screen for several minutes. Just staring at the pitch black monitor. I finally came to and looked at the clock hanging on the wall. It was 5 o'clock. I had just experience what was perhaps the most intense, colourful and psychologically damaging ecstasy ride I might ever feel in my lifetime.\n\nWhen you play this game, you don't blink, you don't breathe, you don't do anything but watch, play and think of nothing. Your soul is absorbed into the monitor as it displays the flashing lights of hypnotism that is Beat Hazard and just when you think it couldn't get any trippier than that, you realise the light intensity goes past 100%.\n\nIf I had to make any critical points against this game, it would be that there was no evil mastermind attempting to control the world through the amazingly vivid colours that this game shoves into your brain.\n\n*Caution: This game contains the side effects of fur growth on the eyeballs, misplaced eyebrows and occasional brain-freezes. Please consult a doctor if you do not experience any of these symptoms as you may be playing the wrong game.*","February 25, 2014","true","10.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/almightyscorpion/recommended/49600/","almightyscorpion","almightyscorpio","http://steamcommunity.com/id/almightyscorpion/","347 products in account","This game is equal parts Geometry Wars, Guitar Hero, and visualization software. Similar to Asteroids, the perspective is top-down, and you have free reign to move your ship in any direction (however, you are limited by the borders of the screen). The ideal way to play this game is with an Xbox 360 controller, as it is a twin-stick shooter (similar to Smash TV).\n\nThe major selling point is that it is also a visualizer. So, your "stages" are actually music tracks. The game ships with several dance/house/edm tracks, however you can add to that listing with music saved onto your hard drive, and for $1.00, you can add iTunes and m&a support. Because it's a visualizer, everything pulsates with the beat of the music; shots, powerups, and your ships lights all thump with the beat. Because of this, certain genres resonate better with it than others (club/hip hop/dance/edm/dubstep/soul/funk/pop being the best, with metal/psychobilly/punk being the most spasmatic). Interestingly, the game will sync enemies and bosses with the music, so when a song gets to a really intense part, you may suddenly get hit with twin bosses and similarly when there's not much going on in the track, you may wind up staring at an empty screen. The game also takes more detail into the game from your music selection by making adjustments to things like enemy/bullet speed, how many of your guns fire during the quieter segments, and how fast time-based score multiplier meters fill up.\n\nThe ideal purchase to make for this game is the Mega Bundle Pack, as it contains all of the DLC (including the aforementioned iTunes/m&a licensing). These include online co-op/competitive play, new bosses, and perks that can be applied to your gameplay, and the Shadow Ops Unit DLC, which adds a rank progression system, ship-specific goals (like destroy 100 asteroids, reach 1,000,000 points in a track), leaderboards for each ship, and even opens up the ship creating system to you. The higher you rank in the Shadow Ops Unit, the more points you get in creating a ship. It also lets you select an image on your hard drive for the ship and upload your creation to the steam workshop for others to download and use. This also means that you can download ships that other users have created (I've seen quite a few Millennium Falcons, Starship Enterprises, X-Wing Fighters, and Tie Fighters, but have also seen the Planet Express Ship, ships from other shooters, and even the Tardis).\n\nHowever, due to the nature of this game's fast moving, brightly colored flashing particle effects, this is not something for epileptics to play or be around, as it will made them seize faster than Axl Rose would find a reason to not play a show. For the rest of us, the $16.99 price point for the Mega Bundle pack is really cheap. While there's virtually no story, it is quite fun to see what the game makes of your favorite music as well as push for the oldschool arcade goals of getting a high score.","April 29, 2014","true","11.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AroNocebo/recommended/49600/","AroNocebo","- Aro -","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AroNocebo/","415 products in account","I had never heard of Beat Hazard before until it randomly popped up in the Steam Summer Sale, so since I really love the music-enhacing gameplay mechanic in most games, I thought it would definitely be worth just under £3 for the Beat Hazard bundle package. This is, without a doubt, the best £3 I have ever spent on Steam.\n\nI have become hopelessly addicted to this game. I've found myself waking up earlier than I usually would just to play this for a little while just to get my day started along with a hot mug of coffee, this is definitely a good game to wake you up if it is nothing else!\nThe best thing about Beat Hazard is that both the gameplay and playability are as large as your music library. The more music you have, the more there is to do, plus there are lots of ulockables, collectable, perks, acheivements, game modes and even more ships to chose from so there are plenty of play styles to try out on all of your music, and even radio stations.\n\nAlongside the fact that Beat Hazard is a brilliant, fun and highly addictive game within itself, it is also a great way to rediscover your own music and to discover new music with it's online play and internet radio links. There is very little to fault about this game and rather than spending money on strobe lights for a party, you'd be better off playing this on a big screen.\n\nThe only thing that I would say to watch out for when buying this, like so many other people have mentioned, is that it features extreme flashing lights/colours throughout the entire game, so it is a hazard itself to people with photosensitive epilepsy; If you are epileptic, I highly advise you avoid this game as even on the lowest visual intesnsity, it is extremely bright, colourful and flashy.\nThis game comes with an epilepsy warning on it's sale page and before the game even loads, it is there for a reason, trust me! You have to stop playing after a certain period of time as it begins to kill your eyes!\n\nAbove all, as an avid music and game lover, this is a perfect casual game that I am very glad I took the time to buy. I would reccomend it to every music fan out there (especially the Electronic/Industrial music fans, Funker Vogt is the perfect band for this game), just not to people with photosensitive epilepsy.\n\nOn a side note: I dont' understand why people are constantly comparing this game to Audiosurf. Both are extremely different in terms of actual gameplay even though they are both rythm-based games and are both good in their own way. Rather than saying "Get Beat Hazard instead" or "Get Audiosurf instead", I say get both, especially when they're on sale.","July 1, 2014","true","26.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

IF you ever need an excuse to listen to mp3's for hours on end this will give you one.\n\nA small tip though; even though it seems counterintuitive- slow music increases the difficulty greatly! The softer music keeps your ship from firing at full power while heavy music is a blast-a-thon.\n\nRecommended Music:\nNightwish. KMFDM. Industrial and EDM in general. For increased difficulty go with Radiohead, Flaming Lips, Classical, etc. Avoid Country music as it causes your pilot to get depressed and eject from the ship.","January 7, 2014","true","24.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AroNocebo/recommended/49600/","AroNocebo","- Aro -","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AroNocebo/","415 products in account","I had never heard of Beat Hazard before until it randomly popped up in the Steam Summer Sale, so since I really love the music-enhacing gameplay mechanic in most games, I thought it would definitely be worth just under £3 for the Beat Hazard bundle package. This is, without a doubt, the best £3 I have ever spent on Steam.\n\nI have become hopelessly addicted to this game. I've found myself waking up earlier than I usually would just to play this for a little while just to get my day started along with a hot mug of coffee, this is definitely a good game to wake you up if it is nothing else!\nThe best thing about Beat Hazard is that both the gameplay and playability are as large as your music library. The more music you have, the more there is to do, plus there are lots of ulockables, collectable, perks, acheivements, game modes and even more ships to chose from so there are plenty of play styles to try out on all of your music, and even radio stations.\n\nAlongside the fact that Beat Hazard is a brilliant, fun and highly addictive game within itself, it is also a great way to rediscover your own music and to discover new music with it's online play and internet radio links. There is very little to fault about this game and rather than spending money on strobe lights for a party, you'd be better off playing this on a big screen.\n\nThe only thing that I would say to watch out for when buying this, like so many other people have mentioned, is that it features extreme flashing lights/colours throughout the entire game, so it is a hazard itself to people with photosensitive epilepsy; If you are epileptic, I highly advise you avoid this game as even on the lowest visual intesnsity, it is extremely bright, colourful and flashy.\nThis game comes with an epilepsy warning on it's sale page and before the game even loads, it is there for a reason, trust me! You have to stop playing after a certain period of time as it begins to kill your eyes!\n\nAbove all, as an avid music and game lover, this is a perfect casual game that I am very glad I took the time to buy. I would reccomend it to every music fan out there (especially the Electronic/Industrial music fans, Funker Vogt is the perfect band for this game), just not to people with photosensitive epilepsy.\n\nOn a side note: I dont' understand why people are constantly comparing this game to Audiosurf. Both are extremely different in terms of actual gameplay even though they are both rythm-based games and are both good in their own way. Rather than saying "Get Beat Hazard instead" or "Get Audiosurf instead", I say get both, especially when they're on sale.","July 1, 2014","true","26.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

So I will still play the game :D\nStill this can't be good for eyes.\n-----------------------------------------------\nEdit to add something as someone didn't like my suggestion (1/2) so turning it into a review:\n\nThe game is pretty fast paced. And slow songs won't make the game easier. You can play with any song and the game includes radio stations. The key of surviving a song is how  long it is as you don't get extra lives during it, but extra bombs every X minutes. On regular songs once on the middle.\nYou can adjust the difficulty level and you can unlock harder difficulties.\nYou can adjust the visual impact 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175 and 200% depending on how mad you want to become after your session.\nThere are powerups to increase damage and volume of the music and point multipliers. You can unlock to get more bombs, increase the multipliers for not shooting and surviving and get powerups from the start of the level.\nSome achievements are easy some are hard and other seem impossibru. Maybe on easier modes, but then you will get bored of the level to get them. I played on difficult all the game but had to move to suicide -there's a harder mode- to be able to get more than 1 million points on a short song (1 m points on all default songs achievement). Will have to reduce difficulty to be able to survive a long enough song to defeat 8 bosses, they appear not regularly, you may not find any on 3-4 minutes and suddenly be fighting two at the same time.\n\nI always liked those ships shooters and I enjoyed this one a lot. I can't do other thing than recommend you all and invite you to survive to your favourite songs on this excellent game.\nI'm going to try to get the dlc on a cheap price during sales to get the new ships with different weaponry.","November 26, 2013","true","18.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

I like having my retinas assaulted by swirls of colorful space dust.\n\nIf you enjoy treating your brain to videogames and music like I do, and are enthralled with the amalgamation of the two, then there’s a good chance you’re going to enjoy Beat Hazard as well.  The twist is that Beat Hazard uses your own music to create custom levels.\n\nBeat Hazard uses songs from your computer, so you can choose which song you want to play and the game creates a level around it.  Levels begin like the arcade classic, Asteroids, where you reduce large hunks of space rocks into smaller pieces with your lasers before some mean old spaceships arrive to provide put up a fight.  The unique aspect of the game is that everything from  the velocity of the asteroids to the quanity of boss ships you fight is dependent upon the music.\n\nBlasting enemy ships into space rubble provides power-ups, which increase your firepower and the volume of the  music.  Your weapons are also influenced by the tune of the music, so when a song is softer or hits a quiet spot, your firepower is greatly reduced.  It’s like the gunner on the ship is a little kid sucking down fistfulls of Pixie Sticks.  He’s running around screaming with his hands in the air one minute and the instant the song tones it down a bit, he is lulled to sleep.\n\nIn addition to determining the patterns of the enemies, the game’s visuals are also greatly affected by the song selection.   As the ship is upgraded, its firepower is transformed from simple white blips into a seizure-inducing kaleidoscope of doom.  Spots in the background that initially appear nondescript also pulsate and swirl with colors to the song’s beat.  It’s something straight out of a Hawkwind concert (or Pink Floyd, for those not in tune with their ’70s space rock).  The background effects intensify the point where it can seem like you’re trying to play a game through a late-90s Windows Media Player visualizer.\n\nDid you ever watch those visualizers and imagine playing a game through it?  Me neither.  That’s because while the visuals are quite impressive and make the game infinitely more compelling for onlookers, they are also a serious hindrance to actually playing the game.  I frequently find myself dying thanks to something that I either didn’t see or assumed was just a part of the background.  I suppose it could be argued that the visuals are a way of increasing the game’s difficulty, particularly for longer songs.\n\nCrazy psychedelic visuals and customizable soundtracks are about as useful as a chainsaw to a beaver if the game feels like a chore to play, and thankfully the meat of Beat Hazard is excellent.  I find twin-stick shooters to be stressful at times because of the never-ending onslaught of ever-increasing enemies, but Beat Hazard is refreshing because your targets appear in waves.  Depending on the song, you tend to have a few seconds to catch your breath before preparing for the next attack.\n\nOne of the unintended benefits of the game is that it gives me an impetus to root through my music collection and dust off some tunes I have not heard in awhile.  I love shuffling through my songs and thinking “Hmm, I wonder what this song will be like?”  I find that in general, songs tend to work better if they are more dynamic and have a lot of changes in their volume or beats.\n\nThe game does a great job of tracking your progress and keeping a tally of how many songs you have beaten, or if you have finished an entire album.  Even if you don’t complete a song, the game still awards experience and you can still gain levels which add bonuses and a feeling of persistence.  Achievements would be a fantastic addition to this game, but unfortunately are absent through no fault of Cold Beam Games.\n\nDespite it being a little too mesmerizing for its own good, Beat Hazard is an amazing experience and quite the technical accomplishment.  It is easy to recommend laying down the $5 for gamers who are music enthusiasts.  Outside of the allure of playing your own music,  Beat Hazard is an exciting and unique shooter and a great addition to the Indie library.\n\nRecommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","November 24, 2014","true","31.6"," 15 of 28 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","15","28","0","0"

I have a form of epilepsy that isn't particularly severe, but can lead to loss of control of limbs and black outs. It is very rare for me to be affected by games, indeed i have only come across 2 in my life. One is Freelancer (though only when travelling through galactic jump gates) and this is the other. If you have any form of photosensitive epilepsy then DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, it WILL enduce an epileptic fit. It's a shame as it looks like a great old school shooter, but it's just too intense in the flashing and shaking imagery departments.","June 9, 2014","false","0.1"," 65 of 127 people (51%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","51","65","127","2","17"

I highly recommend going to bandcamp and getting The Helix Nebula - Meridian.\n\nLOTS of arcade style replay value. If you're into arcade gaming, and this style of game that is.\n\nLots of records to beat, and things to unlock. I love unlocking things in arcade games.\n\n------\n\nCons:\n\nDLC is too pricey at full price for what you get. Recommend spending no more then 2-4 for Ultra, and 2-3 for Shadow Ops.\n\nThey make you pay for access to workshop elements. I mean seriously... I don't really use workshop on anything, but... WTF?\n\nBosses and waves occur at same times every song, every game. Not much variation, and would be cool if it synched bosses with the strongest points of the songs. Some songs have lulls aligned with boss fights, and that's a death sentence.\n\nFull price for game is much like the full price for DLC. A bit too high.\n\n------\n\nWould I recommend this?...\nIf you like arcade games, or hate not being able to listen to your own music with your games often, YES.\n\nIf you get tired of repetitive challenges, Don't like to challenege yourself with insane difficulty settings, or focus too much on the negatives of things rather enjoying what you've got, No.\nThis game has simplicity, and should be enjoyed with simplicity.","December 22, 2014","true","4.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game also has a lot of power ups, weapons, ships, and upgrades you can earn on this game by ranking up with high scores. The game also has local and online co-op. So have a friend you can play and listen to the music you both enjoy. There's some additional challenges from the ships you play to unlock more ships, and/or to rank up your secondary rank. Additionally, there is also the Steam Workshop added to this game. So there is a lot of custom ships and ship skins you can play around with.\n\nThe bad: It will feel very repeatative if you don't have a lot of tracks to play on. It might start to get easier the more upgrades you get, making the harder difficulties feel like a cake walk if you're good at these type of games. Sometimes the flashing effects can be annoying when dodging the red bombs you can't blow up with normal fire.\n\n....All I can say is, buy this game. Especially if this game is on sale. Get it immediatly. If you enjoy listening to music and playing a game at the same time like any other game you play, here you go. And if you got friends who play this game and want them to listen to the music you're playing on this game, then this is for you and everyone. Although I recommend taking a few breaks from playing this game. The flashing lights and strobe effects can be fun to look at. But after a few repeated playthroughs, I started to feel phiscally sick to my stomach and needed a break after playing it too much. Above all, it's fun to kill time and listen to music.\n\nX3","September 13, 2014","true","27.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Think of it as a more intense and visually stunning form of asteroids. The game starts with you selecting the music you would like to hear in the background while playing the game. As the enemies appear on screen the visuals and our ships weapons operate to the beat of the music you previously selected. While defeating enemies power ups will appear throughout the stage and can range from extra bombs in our inventoy to volume control for th background music. Another great feature is that you can select from any music you have on your personal computer. All you do is find the folder your personal music is in, select what song you want to play Beat Hazard to and you are off. Simple as that. This is a very fun game to pass the time or just to see how different music goes with the game.","June 9, 2014","true","1.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Gameplay is interesting in concept, and the music idea is fun.

Remapping the keys helped.  The visuals are REALLY annoying and just serve as a distraction to gameplay.  The game also "rewards" you by having the bonuses / power-ups sometimes shoot off screen so quickly, I often dont bother even going for them unless they are close.\n\nSo far, levelling up has given me no noticeable improvements other than "perks" which dont seem to do much or the game has done a very poor job of explaining how the perks work.

You have several types of enemies with all sorts of appearances and attacks that come in many forms and shapes. There are about 3-4 different type of bosses each with unique form and attack. There are also mini boss versions of the bosses. There's also the player character or player characters if you go multiplayer. UPDATE - There are more ships now to play as than before and now the option to play as community created ships makes the selection quite appealing.\n\n• GamePlay: 10/10\no The game is like a Japanese side scroller shooter which you play as a vehicle and destroy objects that come towards you in the form of meteors, debris, enemy ships, or just giant creatures. You must destroy them to get points and power ups which can do a multitude of things such as a multipler which can increase your score, a P power up which increases your attack power, a VOL power up which increases the volume of the music (in which affects your basic shooting attack pattern and burst shot). You can pretty much use the built in music collection or import your own tracks to play in the background of the game. The music affects your shot attacks, affects the enemy presence and how some power ups are distributed or appear - it is all based on Rhythm or the beat of the game. You have the choice to play single player, multiplayer, boss mode (which you fight bosses non-stop), or even the ability to play the classic Beat Hazard game upon start up for a different visual appearance and different UI. There are ranks which you can achieve based on raking up points from each game you do along with the fact you can unlock/use bonuses in the form of perks you can equip to make things interesting such as increased difficulty or giving you a boost of power in the beginning of a game.\n\n• Graphics: 7/10\no Although the game isnt as graphic intense as most other recent games the game shines at its own creativity. The music itself develops the intensity of the lighting and special effects - depending on the rhythm different colors and splashes may occur which adds variety to the game and gives you a adrenaline rush feeling. However its best to stay back otherwise you'll have a high chance of getting a Seizure (as the game warns you as well when you start it).\n\n• Sound: 7/10\no The game has basic sound effects for explosions, attacks and going through the menu. It feels and sounds like you are literally in a early 1990s or a late 1980s game which is quite nostalgic. There are no voice overs or anything unless you count what you hear in the music or the built in radio.\n\n• Music: 10/10\no The game features a set of tracks already built in along with some radio stations for players who have no music on their computer. The reason why this aspect receives a perfect score is the ability to add your own music to the game which is the ultimate option for this aspect.\n\n• Length: 6/10\no Because the game consists of a side scroller shooter with limited music (and you can add more music) with no direction or storyline the game's length is quite minimal. There are ranks and bonuses in the form of perks you can unlock however should only take you no more than 3 hours to get everything unlocked. UPDATE - Due to the inclusion of the Shadow Operations DLC - there's more to unlock in terms of content (ships) and ranks.\n\n• Replay Value: 10/10\no Although the game has no direction, it allows you to pave your own direction with the ability to put your own music you can play this game and get a different result each time you play. Every game is absolutely different. If single player isnt enough to satisfy your hunger you can do multiplayer co-op or even competitive. There's also boss mode and of course you add music tracks of your own to change up the pace of the game. You can also unlock additional difficulties through perks.\n\n• Player Value: 10/10\no This game is absolutely recommended especially for fans of the music genre, love music and loves shooters. The game is also a great multiplayer experience as you can play all the modes in competitive or co-op (this includes the boss rush mode). You can import your own music or use the built in music or radio stations to give you a different experience each time you play. This is a great game for both hardcore fanatics who want to brag about points or compete with each other and super casuals who just want something to spend time on even if it is for just one game.","December 30, 2013","true","19.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you often find yourself in situations where you need to kill 15-30 minutes, Beat Hazard will do the trick nicely. The Ultra DLC is worthwhile and changes the gameplay in significant ways, Shadow Operations DLC is basically extra grind.\n\nKeep in mind that the game does not support Unicode, so if your music files are tagged with non-Latin characters, you will be staring at rows of question marks instead of artist and track names.","April 27, 2011","true","58.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Each track you play has their own veriety of enemies, mini-bosses, and bosses. So each track you play will have different enemies. The game also has a lot of power ups, weapons, ships, and upgrades you can earn on this game by ranking up with high scores. The game also has local and online co-op. So have a friend you can play and listen to the music you both enjoy. There's some additional challenges from the ships you play to unlock more ships, and/or to rank up your secondary rank. Additionally, there is also the Steam Workshop added to this game. So there is a lot of custom ships and ship skins you can play around with.\n\nThe bad: It will feel very repeatative if you don't have a lot of tracks to play on. It might start to get easier the more upgrades you get, making the harder difficulties feel like a cake walk if you're good at these type of games. Sometimes the flashing effects can be annoying when dodging the red bombs you can't blow up with normal fire.\n\n....All I can say is, buy this game. Especially if this game is on sale. Get it immediatly. If you enjoy listening to music and playing a game at the same time like any other game you play, here you go. And if you got friends who play this game and want them to listen to the music you're playing on this game, then this is for you and everyone. Although I recommend taking a few breaks from playing this game. The flashing lights and strobe effects can be fun to look at. But after a few repeated playthroughs, I started to feel phiscally sick to my stomach and needed a break after playing it too much. Above all, it's fun to kill time and listen to music.\n\nX3","September 13, 2014","true","27.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Beat Hazard is a flashy, spectacular, intense game that looks glorious on your big-screen TV... unless you're epileptic. Its built-in soundtrack is a groovy electronica mix of various indie artists and styles, but in Beat Hazard you can never complain about the crap music, since it hooks in to your own music library.\n\nAs a twin-stick shooter it's more style than substance. The controls are decent, your weapons range from tiny lasers to huge lasers (depending on the intensity of your music at any given time), and there's a range of enemies. But it's not the game you play when you want a twin-stick shooter.\n\nIt's great when you set it on "Easy", put on some music you like, get a drink, treat it as a WinAmp visualiser, and chillax the heck out.\n\nGet the "Ultra" version, which makes the shooter part of the game a bit more varied.\n\nRecommendation: buy.","July 26, 2013","true","2.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Music intensity affects the spawn of enemies and your firing rate, slowing to a crawl in silent parts. It's nice to play with your music, but this isn't Audiosurf-style interaction. I know the meme is to play with high visual intensity and abuse yourself, but just turn the visuals down to 50%. I wish there was a lower setting than that, as the visuals just cloud everything. No one cares what setting you use.\n\nNew weapons make tracks more interesting, but the progression system makes the game hardest at the start. I wish there was a difficulty option between Hardcore and Insane, as there is a fair amount of time where you don't have the ship upgrades to reasonably beat long Insane songs, but Hardcore becomes too simple. The Shadow DLC is compelling, adding new ship options and support for auto-fire ships to further increase the variety. However, the DLC does not change the musical interaction, so the gameplay is identical.\n\nIt's easy to pick up and play, and pretty enjoyable. There's good replayability in theory, but I don't think the shooting is varied enough to come back to it regularly after finishing off all the challenges. Audiosurf has more gameplay options to keep things fresh, but this is still an enjoyable shooter with all the DLC. I'd say $10 USD for the full package would be a great deal, so 30% off everything is pretty fair when that happens.","June 26, 2014","true","31.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can use the music you have on your computer to power the battlefield as you blast away your foes.  It's a simple, but addicting game, especially with the DLC that adds the Shadow Missions (objectives for you to complete with different ships).  The gameplay is simple: you shoot the living crap out of anything that moves on-screen while trying not to get exploded.\n\nThe only major issue I have with this game is that the visuals are sometimes too distracting.  I usually turn the visual intensity option down to 50% when I play, because otherwise it actually kinda hurts my eyes.  This also makes it hard to see some of the projectiles coming towards you, resulting in some really cheap deaths where you literally couldn't see what blew you up.  Since you basically die in one hit, it can be a pain, especially if you're trying to complete a Shadow Mission.\n\nOther than that it's a load of fun to hop in and blow up enemies while listening to your favorite music.  It's well worth the bundle that includes all the DLC as well if it goes on sale.  Buying it full price really depends on how much fun you think you'll have with it.  It's definitely more hardcore than the likes of Audiosurf.  If that's your thing, then put your money down and get shooting.","April 26, 2014","true","19.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The difficulty of the higher settings may be a turn-off to some, but If you play at a comfortable level it's a blast to play. While it is essentially a very flashy and syncronized game of Asteroids, it is something to behold if you enjoy both games and music.\n\nOne thing you want before this game is fast, energetic music. Slower songs tend to be a bit of a drag to play, and really slow everything down to a screeching halt. If all you listen to is acoustic guitar ballads and the occasional ambient music, this game may not be for you. This game works best with faster music, obviously, so if you have some dubstep, punk, high-energy electronic or metal on there you will have a blast.","January 6, 2014","true","17.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The difficulty of the higher settings may be a turn-off to some, but If you play at a comfortable level it's a blast to play. While it is essentially a very flashy and syncronized game of Asteroids, it is something to behold if you enjoy both games and music.\n\nOne thing you want before this game is fast, energetic music. Slower songs tend to be a bit of a drag to play, and really slow everything down to a screeching halt. If all you listen to is acoustic guitar ballads and the occasional ambient music, this game may not be for you. This game works best with faster music, obviously, so if you have some dubstep, punk, high-energy electronic or metal on there you will have a blast.","January 6, 2014","true","17.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are a TON of flashing lights in this game.\n\nI remember a year or so ago that I first heard of it in a video I can't remember what it was about. I decided to get it since I was kinda curious and I liked the idea of gameplay based on music, as I enjoyed audiosurf myself. It kinda just sat there for a while. And with a while I mean over a year. So now I tried it again and played some vidya tunes on it. And I must say, it's quite enjoyable.\n\nTo put it simply, this is a 2D, dare I say arcade-like shooter. But the 'levels' to put it like there are based of the soundtrack you choose, and the more intense the music is, the more things happen on the screen. There's probably also something with the rhythm, but I didn't notice it all that much. But I'm probably missing something. There are different enemies and bosses. Most of them vary from size, projectiles, and movement paths, to put it like that. That's really all I can say for the enemies. Oh right there are bosses as well I suppose.\n\nThere are also perks you can unlock by playing (or that is part of the ultra DLC pack. Which I think it is.), Which are basically bonuses to help you out, or unlock some new stuff.\n\nIn the end. I can recommend this game if you have some money in your steam wallet which you don't know what to spend it on, if it's on sale, or you are just curious. I myself think this is a pretty good game to play if you're bored and want to shoot things while listening to any song from Metal Gear Rising or any Pursuit theme from Ace Attorney. That's simply the best thing.","May 26, 2015","true","0.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Music intensity affects the spawn of enemies and your firing rate, slowing to a crawl in silent parts. It's nice to play with your music, but this isn't Audiosurf-style interaction. I know the meme is to play with high visual intensity and abuse yourself, but just turn the visuals down to 50%. I wish there was a lower setting than that, as the visuals just cloud everything. No one cares what setting you use.\n\nNew weapons make tracks more interesting, but the progression system makes the game hardest at the start. I wish there was a difficulty option between Hardcore and Insane, as there is a fair amount of time where you don't have the ship upgrades to reasonably beat long Insane songs, but Hardcore becomes too simple. The Shadow DLC is compelling, adding new ship options and support for auto-fire ships to further increase the variety. However, the DLC does not change the musical interaction, so the gameplay is identical.\n\nIt's easy to pick up and play, and pretty enjoyable. There's good replayability in theory, but I don't think the shooting is varied enough to come back to it regularly after finishing off all the challenges. Audiosurf has more gameplay options to keep things fresh, but this is still an enjoyable shooter with all the DLC. I'd say $10 USD for the full package would be a great deal, so 30% off everything is pretty fair when that happens.","June 26, 2014","true","31.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I love shooter-sidescrolling games and survival challenges and music, so it's a lot of fun to play when you want to kill some time and listen to music before going to work. I love the bosses and the different enemy types. They really make you work hard when trying to survive, especially when you don't finish them off and your whole screen is covered in bosses trying to kill you.

Recently i started to play Beat Hazard again and purchased the Shadow Operations Unit DLC.\n\nGameSo what is this game about. You choose a spaceship, the basic one or the different ships from the Shadow Operations Unit DLC. Then you choose a song, either your own songs or the different ones from the radio stations provided by Beat Hazard.\nThe gameplays consists of you floating around, shooting different enemys to the beat of your favorite songs. There are  four more different game modes.\n\nStandart: you basically choose a song and play it.\n\nBoss Rush: again you choose a song, but instead of normal enemys you fight only bosses. You have a timer for every boss, meaning if you take your time you can easily have up to 4-5 bosses on screen. Also dont worry the song isn't going to be repeated. You choose a song. From there every song in that folder will be played.\n\nSurvival: Choose a song where you start off from. After that you basically have to survive wave after wave, like the name of this game mode already suggest. Like in boss rush you start with the song you chose, after that every song in the same folder will be played.\n\nChill out: The same as survival but without lives and scores. You just keep playing until you have enough :D\nAlso like in boss rush you start with the song you chose, after that every song in the same folder will be played.\n\nPerks: While playing songs you collect money that you can use to buy those perks. There are various perks to enhance your overall score for every song, perks for different weapons and shields. The last thing you can unlock with the money are 2 more difficulties.\n\nShadow Operations Unit DLC.\n\nThe DLC adds different spaceships to the game which all have their own missions. Per spaceship you have 3 missions. You rank up everytime you complete one of those missions.\n\n\nConclusion\nBeat Hazard is a really fun game, gameplay is simple but entertaining. I spend 50 hours on this game,  getting the achivements, play the different gamemodes, play multiplayer with friends. The only thing i would have to mention is the DLC. Personally i dont think its worth the 5€. You only get a few different spaceships which, lets be honest, all have the same missions: "collect this x times"  "Kill x enemy x times"  "get x points on x songs on x difficulty". The ships are kinda interesting and fun to play but i really don't think its worth 5€ considering that you can get spaceships from the steam workshop for free..\nNevertheless Beat Hazard is a really good game and will keep you entertained for lots of hours, even without the dlc.","October 29, 2014","true","54.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

Effectively, Beat Hazard is a ombination of all of those things.\n\nBecause the gameplay is generated by your music your mileage may vary by a lot.  This isn't like Audiorsurf, where each song is playable if boring: certain songs are not playable at all.  The reason behind this is that sometimes nothing can happen in the song you're playing, or worse, monsters might spawn just before you hit a slow point.  The biggest issue with this game is that the music not only dictates monster spawns but also has a direct influence on your basic attack: You will not be able to kill things during quieter parts of the song.  This is absolutely game breaking at times.\n\nStill, if you know that you can avoid the problem, and honestly I really like the gameplay.  Beat Hazard has changed a lot over the years, to the point that I don't really recognize it from when I first played it.  There's an overall level up system and some perks, but they're not so important to the gameplay (at least that's my opinion).\n\nUnlike audiosurf this is hardly a chillout game.  This isn't something that I'll boot up when I just want to listen to music and maybe have something to do in the background: the gameplay gets pretty intense at times.  It's not necessarily difficult, but it does remind me of how harrowing geometry wars can get.\n\nI like this game but I don't play it very often, and gameplay isn't so different between songs that it feels unique.  For the most part each song plays out pretty similarly, which is good and bad.\n\nAt the end of the day I think you should have this in your library.\n\nOh, but the ♥♥♥♥ing ad that pops up as you're closing the game?  The one that reverses the accept and cancel buttons?  That screen can ♥♥♥♥ off.  Press A to exit, press a to exit, PRESS A TO GO BACK TO THE ♥♥♥♥ING MAIN MENU AND START AGAIN.

Effectively, Beat Hazard is a ombination of all of those things.\n\nBecause the gameplay is generated by your music your mileage may vary by a lot.  This isn't like Audiorsurf, where each song is playable if boring: certain songs are not playable at all.  The reason behind this is that sometimes nothing can happen in the song you're playing, or worse, monsters might spawn just before you hit a slow point.  The biggest issue with this game is that the music not only dictates monster spawns but also has a direct influence on your basic attack: You will not be able to kill things during quieter parts of the song.  This is absolutely game breaking at times.\n\nStill, if you know that you can avoid the problem, and honestly I really like the gameplay.  Beat Hazard has changed a lot over the years, to the point that I don't really recognize it from when I first played it.  There's an overall level up system and some perks, but they're not so important to the gameplay (at least that's my opinion).\n\nUnlike audiosurf this is hardly a chillout game.  This isn't something that I'll boot up when I just want to listen to music and maybe have something to do in the background: the gameplay gets pretty intense at times.  It's not necessarily difficult, but it does remind me of how harrowing geometry wars can get.\n\nI like this game but I don't play it very often, and gameplay isn't so different between songs that it feels unique.  For the most part each song plays out pretty similarly, which is good and bad.\n\nAt the end of the day I think you should have this in your library.\n\nOh, but the ♥♥♥♥ing ad that pops up as you're closing the game?  The one that reverses the accept and cancel buttons?  That screen can ♥♥♥♥ off.  Press A to exit, press a to exit, PRESS A TO GO BACK TO THE ♥♥♥♥ING MAIN MENU AND START AGAIN.

It completely replaced Audiosurf as my go-to music game. It can be easy and relaxing as well as immensely challenging. The game could react to the music a bit better sometimes, but it's definitely not worse than any other music game I've played in that regard.\n\nI don't see myself playing this for hours, but as something you jump into for a few songs just to turn your brain off for a bit it works excellently and I wholly recommend it.

Hell, the strobing effects and the light pulses are compelling to look at until your eyes start to go blind. Textures, aside from the strobing and the effects, are what you'd expect from top-down space shooter games: A spaceship (customizable in Shadow Operations DLC - I'll get to this later), weird enemies (varies depending on Beat Hazard Ultra - I'll get to that later), and floating brown rocks.\n\nGameplay/Functionality\nYep, it's nothing new, but the concept of playing a bullet-hell top-down space shooter game to your own songs is still pretty darn awesome to someone who loves music and games, or both, or whatever! You're able to import your own songs into the game or you could choose to play some pre-made songs from the menu. On top of that, your bullets and the amount/aggressiveness of your enemies varies and correlates to the song that's being played, e.g. I you've got a slow paced song, your bullets are slowed, and deal less damage, but the enemies are also slowed and are less aggressive. On top of that, your bullets' color and size change to the song, like when a high pitch is thrown at you, your color changes to pink, I believe. There's the option of going multiplayer, but it is in the Ultra pack, which I'll get to in a second.\n\nLongevity\nTruthfully, this depends on what type of perosn the player is. As one who loves music, and chaotic games, bullet-hell games like this fit my criterium even if it isn't the most innovative game out there. To some, this might be a tad repetitive over time, but I certaintly enjoyed slaughtering rocks and weird tentacle things and whatnots.\n\nAdditional Words and Notes  if you do plan on buying this game, buy the Beat Hazard package which comes with DLC and Ultra, because it costs less than buying it seperately (which I did, sadly) and also because of the extra functions it gives, which I guarantee will be quite awesome.\nFirst off, the Shadow Ops DLC comes with the ability to customize your vehicle, use and/or submit spacecrafts into the community to share and enjoy, and the DLC also provides missions with different vehicles. Each pre-made starcraft has 3 missions each, and gives a different amount of stars that are awarded after the completion of the task. These stars are pretty much what you need to earn to rank up in the military-type environment, hence the name of the DLC: Shadow Operations.\nBeat Hazard Ultra comprises of different benefits, including the addition of many more perks, two new difficulty levels, and the Multiplayer gamemode, where you could team up with one other player through various types of music and songs.\nIf you do plan on buying this game, buy the Beat Hazard package which comes with DLC and Ultra, because it costs less than buying it seperately (which I did, sadly) and also because of the extra functions it gives, which I guarantee will be quite awesome.","August 8, 2015","true","17.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Bonus if you love Christmas music they have achievements for that.\n\nI love the game it is a good way to relax and listen to music at the same time without it getting annoying like in most games.You can also just let it play music and enjoy the visual if your into that sort of thing,i sometimes double it as a music player.\n\nPros for Beat Hazard classic\n\n+Fast paced action with a old school feel for Astroid games\n+Smooth game play and neat visual effects\n+Ships to unlock or download from workshop\n+It is a blast with a friend\n+It gives you a reason to annoy your neighbors,crank it up!!\n\nCons for Beat Hazard Classic\n\n- Can only select songs by folder or individual no options for custom play list\n- Wish it had an option to customize what type of enimies you face\n- Can be hard to keep track of things on screen when things get crazy\n- Wish it had more play styles like Ultra does\n\nPros for Ulta\n\n+Fast paced action with a old school feel for Astroid games\n+Smooth game play and neat visual effects amped up even more\n+Ships to unlock or download from workshop\n+Perks system and a hanger to check out your ships with\n+Last FM built into game\n+Keyboard Configuration\n+It is a blast with a friend\n+Can play the same tracks with friends as long as you both have the same one\n+It gives you a reason to annoy your neighbors,crank it up!!\n\n\nCons for Ulta\n\n-Can be even harder to keep track of things going on screen even when you turn down visuals\n-Can have issues with saves due to syncing with cloud issues,i had to delete my save to get it start after re-installing game to play it again,lost progress because of it.\n- Level 5 badge to unlock a ship:ship is cosmetic but still have to spend money to reach level 5\n- Can only select songs by folder or individual no options for custom play list\n- Wish it had an option to customize what type of enimies you face would love to face different ships depening on song and so on but eh again a mior gripe.\n\nMake sure you enable Steam cloud servies before launching Ultra or it will just loop at loading screen,why this is not fixed or an issue is beyound me but it is a minor gripe.\n\nOver all i  love the game and bought this game because i have to face the fact that  i am terrible at music rhythm games and i tried Audio Surf and i just did not care for it,I checked this game out and watched the video and it reminded me of Retro Evovled only with my own music,so i bought it and do not regret it one bit.\n\nThen Humble had a bundle that had the Ultra content and i had to buy it and love Ultra also.Though i do have issues at times of keeping track of everything going on screen and die because my ship blends in with everything else even with visual turned all the way down.I know this is not a issue for everyone but i did find a lot people did have the same issues and asked if more could be done,but nothing has and fell on deaf ears\n\nThat being siad that is a minor thing and does not take away from the fun but it can take away from the competitive side knowing you died not by your mistake but by merely losing track of your ship because to much visual effects.\n\nIn the end regardless if you like astroids or music i think you will love this game if you love music based games.Also if you love Retro Evolved and would love to play something akin to it with your own music then you must gets this!!\n\n\nAnyhow i know i am not always the best at making reviews but i am trying to improve on that.I hope at least one person finds this helpful,Enjoy the game,have fun and stay safe!","March 13","true","17.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Visą tai žaidimui suteikia savotišką kabliuką. Tikrai puikus indie žaidimas. Kam patiko Audios Surf ir Simphony patariu išmeginti ir ši žaidimą. 9/10 // Music issue has never been more fun, bosses, enemies, extra power. All this gives the game wonderful atmosphere. Definitely a great indie game. Who liked Audios Surf and Simphony should try this one.

Beat Hazard uses ur music and the effects go off the beat of your song. If you buy this you MUST get the ultra dlc. It makes the game sooooo much better!!!\n\nIts a great game to play when you wanna listen to music but wanna play something (like audiosurf) but beat hazard takes it to a new level.\n\nRecommend to all and especially to a certain friend they know who they are ;)","December 15, 2013","true","17.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","2"

When creating your ship, you can choose from several attributes such as the ship's size, how fast/slow it accelerates, top speed, how fast/slow it decelerates, how strong the bullets are, how fast the bullets move, position of the guns, whether or not you repel or attract perks, how many beams (1-3), and more.  You also get to set up to three missions for your creation so you can make them easy, hard, or a mix.  As you gain higher ranks, you unlock some nice cosmetic attributes such as flares and engine thrust colour. It really is a lot of fun and it gives you new ways to enjoy Beat Hazard.\n\nAny song with the Shadow OPs icon next to it has a chance to spawn what you need for missions. Additional info from a quote from Starg: "The 'play random track' and 'one I've not played before' will also automatically choose a song that fits the current mission criteria."\n\n\nOriginal recommendation I wrote for the game (23 July 2013):\n\nI bought this before the sale ended, after having played the demo, and I have to say, it's pretty damn fun. I explode a lot but that's part of the fun for me, destruction to all!!! mwahahaha. The game is wicked cool and I'm glad I bought the complete package so that I have all the nuts & bolts to fiddle with. It's interesting trying out different songs from my computer, some of them get so intense that there's so much going on on the screen that I lose track of, well, everything. Some of my songs have lulls in them where I'm sitting in space twiddling my thumbs getting the Daredevil (and the other one, I forget the name), counting up. I've only played around 26 minutes so far, as far as the in-game counter goes, but it's been fun.","April 17, 2014","true","31.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
