What's not to like? That mechanic alone made this an instant no brainer. This is a must get for people who like emergent gameplay.\n\nIf you're familiar with the first A Wizard's Lizard, this is improved in every way. If you're new, you don't have to go back and play the previous game, because this stands so well on its own.\n\nThe two developers are very open about their development process and very responsive to feedback. If you like to get involved in the process of making a game, this is a great one to get early.\n\nRight now (4/5/16) the only downside is a lack of content. This is because the guys have been working hard on getting core game design elements RIGHT before pumping out broken and unfun game elements. Lately they have been pushing out content and the game is rapidly filling out. I expect the content problem to be very temporary.\n\nThis game is seriously worth your time. It was certainly worth mine.","April 5","true","2.2"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

But, seriously - this is a REALLY good game!\n\nI played the first instalment quite a bit, but, with hindsight, I can see it wasn't really for me. I'm not a very twin-stick-shootery guy, and while I definitely had a good time with the game, much of my value came from being involved in the development discussion.\n\nWith Soul Thief it is different. I absolutely still enjoy following the development process (and if you're at all interested in game dev, so will you!) through the podcast and forums, but I also really enjoy the GAME.\n\nIt might not be obvious at first but Soul Thief is radically different from AWL1. Gone is the endless ammo, leaving you to rely on your tail whip which requires you to get up close and personal. Sometimes you get wands which give you a ranged attack, but since the ammo is very limited the sense of danger never leaves.\n\nAnd, of course, the possession mechanic. It works SO well! The death mechanic of the first game, while a cool idea, never really took off (sorry Matt & Geoff!). But being able to play as the monsters in this game is not a mere gimmick - since health is so scarce it is a way of survival, and you always feel rather naked when you have to use your Raga vessel. Also the various monsters have radically different attacks and play styles, which makes for a really fun experience and opens up tactical choices.\n\nThe graphics are also a major improvement over the first game - it keeps the same charm, but with more detail and more character.\n\nThe game is still a bit thin on content - this is early access, after all - but I'm really impressed with how it already feels like a complete experience in spite of that. The core gameplay is simply really solid!\n\nWrapping up; Soul Thief sports a really enjoyable gameplay that is only going to improve as development progresses and content grows. Heartily recommended!\n","April 8","true","24.1"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

"\n- Great soul shifting experience you probably never saw before.\n- A few items to find, some unlockables to do in the beginning\n\nIt feels polished so far, like I said and I cannot stress this enough, if you compare this game in its current state to the previous one you WILL get disappointed because this is still an early access product but it really does get the advertised " Weekly updates " And I am satisfied with this.\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR\n\nIf you liked the first game, or was ever interested in the idea of roguelike games like boi and the such, you might get intrigued by this game because it basically has all of those features and displays it in a colorful and cute fashion that I really like.\n\nAlso don't forget its still on its early stages.\n\n","May 1","true","2.6"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

Do you like random dungeons, loot, and or wizards and or LIZARDS?!! Well then this is the game for you!\n\nLong version:\nI really love games. There is no other way to say it. Board games, video games, whatever it may be, there is just something so fun and alluring about being dropped into another world, figuring it out, and accomplishing whatever challenges it sets out before you.\n\nI was fortunate enough to be allowed to experience this game for the last couple of weeks, and I have had a great time for all the right reasons.\n\nFirstly, the game is hard, but its difficulty is not a gimmick. Its challenges are understandable and fair. It is very obvious the developers spent a lot of time thoughtfully crafting this experience to make sure you can figure out what's going on around you, to allow you to formulate your own thoughts on how to accomplish your goals, your own way, without bombarding you with tutorials or text that stop you from enjoying the game.\n\nThe possession mechanic keeps you on the edge of your seat. Jumping from monster to monster just barely escaping death is exciting- just as choosing the right monster for the right situation makes you feel smart. Coupled with getting your favorite wand can make you feel unstoppable, but running out of charges makes you appreciate the game's difficulty.\n\nAs you progress you will find that because the developers did such a good job of ensuring you understand the game's threats and mechanics, you will become quite masterful- my favorite part of a game is when they challenge you to do something outside of your comfort zone, but still allow you to do it 'your' own way. This is exactly what the meta progression of this game encourages. Your skill alone is the key to another interesting challenge just around the corner.\n\nThe game is still in development obviously, but it has a level of polish that is really refreshing. The sound effects, and little extra bounces and animations are just really very pleasing, impressive, and appreciated. The music is catchy and fun; sooner or later you will hum along while playing it. The aesthetic is brilliant- a mix of cute and gruesome, without being too much of either. The lighting effects create a really fun and unique ambiance, that makes you want to stay just a bit longer...\n\nOkay, I've said a lot of good things about AWL: Soul Thief, so are you ready for the bad?!\n\nWell honestly I've got nothing for you. Of course it's not perfect, but it's exactly what it should be, an interesting, unique, rewarding, challengingly fun experience that leaves you wanting more- and thank goodness because it's only just now coming to early access, which the developers have stated they want to add a bunch more to this game before they are done. I don't know about anyone else, but I can't wait to see what other fun exciting stuff they come up with.\n\nWhether you buy it or not, I hope you have fun playing whatever you're playing these days, because I am always amazed that we live in a time where you can just sit down at your computer and dive into a world other people spent so many hours bringing to life for you to enjoy.\n\n-Vox","April 5","true","94.7"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","4"

The combat is tighter, and more focused, which is a recurring theme withing the game, even in Early Access, everything feels more solid.\n\nIt's a shame I'm not very good at it - hopefully there's some melee centric additions heading my way.\n\nFinally, a note on Early Access - the developers are incredibly engaged in their community, and I feel it's safe to say that they will continue to work hard to make this game something special.\n\n10/10 DID buy again.","April 5","true","16.6"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"

Possessing different enemies to have different attacks is pretty fun. I also find there's just a lot of other improvements over the first one.

The first game was too hard. I've beaten the first boss so far, took me about 30 min, which is kinda long, but still it felt good to get there. In the first one I only beat the zombie warlord once.\n\nThis game really reminds me of the dungeons of Zelda. Fun to explore, cute enemies, and some puzzles and secrets.\n\nI also like the tail whip, and of course YOU CAN TAKE OVER THE MONSTERS!!! So far my favorite monster to become is the book of bats, there's something oddly satisfying about shooting some bats out of your body to destroy your foes.\n\nThe developers are just two guys, they are working as hard as they can to make this game the best it can be.

And is build to be a great foundation for the future.\nIn the game you play as "Raga" the Lizard... of a Wizzard. Yep.\n\n\nRaga has a Standart Area of Effect attack, and the ability to shot out his little soul to posses enemy monsters.\n\nWhen you posses an enemy you get acces to their attack, aswell as their movementability [ Meaning how fast they run, or slow, some also fly] You also get the HP assinged to said monster, the damage count also gets taken over.\nSo if you have an damaged enemy, and you posses it, it will be damaged.\nWhile possesing an enemy your Lizard body can still be hurt, so take care of it!\n\nIf you leave a monster again it will be able to attack you again, and will have the same HP as you had when you still possesed it.\n\n\n\nThere are Active Items in the form of "Wands" They vary from a Fireball attack to Freezing enemies, to even\nSHOOTING OUT KILLER BEES. And as we all know, there are no bad game where you can wield bees as weapons.\n\n\nThere are also passive items in the form of Trinkets, that give various bonuses from Increasing Ragas standart attack, to giving you a % chance to heal when you kill enemies.\n\n\n\nTIME TO BEAT\n\nAt the moment of writing, there are three Zones in the game, each with a Boss at the end, and randomely generated layouts.\n\nAs an avid Roguelike player it took me 2,5 hours to complete the game for the first time. This may vary on your experience in these kinds of games. Now That I have spent around 6 Hours ingame im able to win runs in 18-25 Minutes mostly, Although I dont win every run of course.\n\nThere are also unlockables in the game that you can purcharse for "Tickets [an ingame currency]" after you do certain things.\n\n\nEARLY ACCES NOTE\nYes there will be bugs, this is an early acces product after all, and is planned to release in around 6 Months, but so far I have not encountered any amebreaking or game hinderung bugs.\n\n\nRATING\n777 Ragas out of a Wizard","April 5","true","25.6"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

However this was a great surprise to find a game that is unique with a style that helps relate this game to its prequel, but still feel as it's own. Instead of finding weapons, now you're finding new bodies of monsters. Each with their own unique skill and able to hold one item that provides a second skill. Simple mechanics make for an enjoyable experience as you mix and match your abilities through the monsters you choose to play as, or not since you can play as the lizard if you so choose. Gameplay feels natural and is easy to pick up.  I'd recommend this game to everyone.","April 11","true","1.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The game is still in Early Access so you expect things to be in flux and to have some hiccups. That said, I was very surprised with how polished the game already is for an Early Access game (probably since they could leverage a lot of the first game's code).\n\nFor me though, the value of this game is in following the developers progress and design decisions throughout the project. They are extremely transparent on their podcast and it's a ton of fun watching the game improve and hearing the ups and downs of their process. To me it's a bit like kickstarting a project except you can play right now and you get way more out of it than a few micro blog posts from the devs. Supporting the developers will also help make the game better at release because the devs are constantly responding to and considering fan feedback on the forum.\n\nPodcast link:\nhttp://www.lostdecadegames.com/lostcast/","April 18","true","2.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"
