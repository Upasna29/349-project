"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/207400/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","The third (and so far final) game in the eXceed series, Jade Penetrate Black Package is 100% fan service. From the outrageous number of bullets that fill the screen, to the cute girls wearing compromising clothing, it knows what it is and who it's targeted to, and that is actually a good thing.\n\nOpting to refine not redefine it's basic gameplay, eXceed 3rd ditches the 2nd game's color swapping mechanic in favor of simple raw shoot-em-up action. There is some depth to be found in utilizing a lock on move that cuts down your movement speed, but generally speaking you'll be holding down the shoot button and just trying to stay alive through the torrent of blue and read particles blowing up around you.\n\nDespite being simpler than its immediate predecessor, this is easily the most enjoyable and satisfying of the series. The overly dramatic story proves unintentionally hilarious, the graphics 16-bit eye candy, and the soundtrack once again setting the bar for games in this genre (really, it's incredible). The one downside is that it's quite short even for a bullet-hell game, but given the high difficulty even on easy, there's the potential for lots of replayability as you improve and take on the higher levels.\n\nIf you've enjoyed either of the prior eXceed games, or just like bullet-hell shooters in general you can't go wrong with Jade. This is the culmination of everything the developer has worked toward with the eXceed games, and as far as I'm concerned the best of the lot. It might be traditional in design, and perhaps even exploitative in nature, but taken for what it is I'd find it hard not to recommend it for fans. Because again that's what it is: pure unadulterated fan service of the best kind!","November 22, 2013","true","1.9"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","20","22","0","2"

This is, in my opinion, the best of the eXceed series. It's more fast-paced and challenging, the soundtrack is catchy and befitting of the chaos on-screen, and it's probably the easiest to get into. There are so many positives that it almost makes me forget about the problems that plagued the first game (though one again, you'll need Microsoft Application Compatibility Tool to get this game optimized for newer machines). All-in-all, the eXceed series is a great series of bullet-hell shooters, and they saved the best for last.

It's a bullet hell, but it's also pretty accessible to people who aren't experienced with the genre.  Nice art and excellent music in the form of an awesome heavy metal soundtrack.  This is actually a remake of eXceed 3rd - Jade Penetrate.  The original had a slightly less snicker-generating title, and largely the same music (both soundtracks can be bought on bandcamp), though it played significantly faster and the gameplay was different other ways as well.\n\nThis game is just a straight-up bullet hell, unlike eXceed 2nd which was a polarity-based bullet hell game.  There are four action buttons: shoot, bomb (clears everything on screen and gets you limited invulnerability), special, and slowdown.  (Five if you count the pause button.)  (Auto-)collect tokens from defeated enemies and graze their bullets (you can hear when it happens) to charge your special meter, and when it's full, release it to do a homing attack.  You also collect attack pods that follow you around, and either shoot forward (when you're not using slow) or do a homing focus fire (when you are doing slow).  Hold down the slow button to move more precisely, and also visualize your hitbox as a bright orange circle at the center of your sprite -- grazing means letting bullets come close to but not touch this!  As you first learn the game, there's also an auto-bomb setting that will basically give you more lives to work with.\n\nThe storyline is simple but amusing and fitting.  You're Rayne Lindwurm, the younger sister of the Lindwurm dragon clan.  Your school is conducting what's basically the local preliminaries to fill the seat of a Cardinal Lord in Pandemonium.  By preliminaries, we mean a magical combat tournament of course.  Five opponents stand in your way, all of whom are horrible jerks (except the stage four boss, she's cool), the most powerful and biggest jerk of which is your own older sister, who just loves rubbing it in that she's better than you.  But this time, you get to kick her ♥♥♥.\n\nThe game has five stages, each culminating in a multi-phase boss fight.  Oh, and if you manage to beat the game without using contniues or auto-bomb, there's a bonus boss waiting for you.\n\n(Disclosure: I acquired this game as part of the Indie Gala Summertide bundle.)","May 2","true","12.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

The storyline is allright, but I highly recommend starting this game on the highest difficulty, which is Hard.\n\nThere are some cons though, difficulties are actually not any easier when you play them on a lower difficulties.  This game is not as hardcore as Touhou, so if you expect insane level difficulty like Touhou, you may be disappointed.\n\nThe good side is that if you are new to these types of games, there's an Autobomb and Autoslow which triggers bombs or slow the game down to help you if your life is totally on the line.  I have only gotten to see autobomb a few times because I kept dying at an intense area.\n\nPlayers will go through the trouble to try to fix the game so it runs at 60 FPS and not 30 FPS.  You want 60 FPS because the speed of the bullets move depending on your FPS.\n\n9.5 out of 10.","July 14, 2014","true","17.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The story is interesting, the gameplay fluid and the difficulty curve is well balanced, so it should be easy enough for newcomers and difficult enough for Veterans.

Who is Jade and who penetrated her black package? That is something we may never know. Moving on from that very weird name, Exceed 3 is a reboot of the series and is set in a different dimension. Only one of the previous characters briefly show up and everyone else are new characters. We play as Rayne Lindwurm who is in a fight to the death tournament with other mages to decide who will become one of the 7 Lords of the realm. It all sounds very exciting but in reality it is a pretty boring story and thankfully we still have the option to turn off dialogue. This has the same issue as the last game in that it has the subtitles broken if you are play in fullscreen, which is kind of unforgivable to make that mistake yet again when one your selling points is a “Cutscene-driven story-telling” experience.\n\nWe are given the choice to either play Arcade or Practice mode. Practice mode is supposed to let you choose any level but it is broken and only allows you to choose the first level making the mode utterly useless. One of the first things that you will notice is that the graphics are much improved . They are not impressive by any means but it is a big step forward from the last game. Our character does not have the ability to switch magic types and absorb bullet types which is unfortunate since that was a really cool feature. In it's stead we have a fews bombs per life and the ability to make your character move slower. It's nothing unique and felt like a step down from the previous entry. Bombs let you clear all the projectiles on the screen and has a small zone that can damage enemies while slowing down also allows you to narrow your shots and target a specific enemy. You also have a  special attack which fires homing beams at an enemy and is recharged by avoiding projectiles when they are very close to hitting you.\n\nPowerups are also included into this entry. We have one where you someone a familiar for extra fire power and another that gives you an extra bomb. Your familiars are very handy and is the only way target enemies when you slow down. If you die they revert to their powerup form and bounce around the screen until you collect them again. There are three diffculty modes and if you are finding the game too hard you can enable the auto-bomb setting which will detonate a bomb every time you get hit effectively tripling your lives. Which may be a wise choice for new players since Exceed 3 wastes no time showering you with tons of projectiles. There are still red and blue projectiles but their color doesn't really matter this time as they will both kill you in one shot. Controller support isn't listed but it still works perfectly with a controller and has rebindable keys. It does not feature dpad support sadly. Also the escape key still closes the whole game instead of pausing.\n\nMini bosses have also been added in between levels but they are the same robot each level so fighting them gets a bit boring. There are 6 bosses in the game and it takes quite a while to defeat them since they have like five forms of fighting that will refill their health five times but change how projectiles are shot at you. In the last game they had three forms but changed appearance or had some kind of flashy animation when they switched but in this they just switch projectile patterns making the fights feel a bit too dragged out. Remember to use the slow down feature when fighting bosses as the narrow shots will defeat them a lot faster than your spread shots. Bombs are also very effective against bosses if you can get in close enough to actually harm them with it and may be a better used as weapons when a boss form is too difficult for you as they will cause massive damage causing them to switch to a different form.\n\nExceed 3 feels like a straight bullet hell game as it no longer requires any of the strategy of the 2nd and does not reach the heights of the previous game in my opinion. It is by no means a bad game though and is far far better than the first Exceed game. It would actually be one of Steam's best bullet hells if practice mode worked, full screen subtitles worked and if bosses showed some signs of being worn down or angered throughout the fight. As it stands it is an inferior sequel with all the same technical problems of the 2nd that have not been fixed for some reason and introduces some new ones including a whole broken mode. Most of the problems with Exceed 3 are due to technical issues and not the actual game itself. Our character is less fun to play as this time around and Exceed 3 has nothing to do with the previous games but it is still a very fun fast paced bullet hell that will keep any fan of the genre entertained.","June 28, 2015","true","6.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Vastly superior graphics (though, still has repeating backgrounds) and the game doesn't look like an amateur Photoshop project like the first game. Sharper UI (more than standard version), more intimidating looking ships, and different colored bullets give you an idea of their speed. You also can activate a slow mode which weill auto aim bullets from your familiars, slow your speed, and show your hitbox. There's also a stronger emphasis on player skils and faster kills - drops automatically home in to you so you're not trying to manage bullet dodging while grabbing points. Your special moves involves you grazing bullets along your sprite so you can build a special meter for homing lasers Zone of the Enders style to take out large groups and cause big damage to bosses. The sound track is a fantastic mix of techno and metal and among my favorites. Exceed 3rd JPBP is among my top favorite bullet hell vert shmups.

That said, it's pretty easy on the lower difficulties.  I comfortably cleared it on easy on my first playthrough, so I would recommend ramping 'er up to at least normal on your first run unless you're completely new to the genre.  Unlike the previous game, Vampire, Jade Penetrate uses a more traditional mechanic of either spread fire (with fast movement) or focused fire (with slow movement to avoid projectiles and a homing weapon).  You have bombs to avoid dying and you also power up your special weapon by "grazing" enemy bullets.  While usually a more advanced technique, in Jade Penetrate this mechanic is used in quite possibly the best way I've ever seen it done - many of the shot patterns include very cool circular walls of bullets that you graze as they spin, quickly powering up your special attack to decimate the opponents you face.  The visuals are also outstanding, colorful explosions and huge walls of enemy fire - it's just what you'd want from a game like this.  Different colored (yet easily distinguishable) shots, score tokens that are collected automatically, and bullets that you absorb upon an enemy's death to rack up that high score.  That said, the frame rate can suffer a little bit with so many sprites on the screen; however, in games like this the lagging frames may turn out to be an answered prayer, as dodging enemy fire is much easier.\n\nPowering up your weapons is this game is also quite neat, instead of making your main attack stronger, as many shmups do, in Jade Penetrate you collect "D" tokens which give you little dragon familiars that attack for you.  They're actually your homing attacks too, so as the game advances and you face harder enemies that you have to dodge more against, your weapon that always hits (as long as you're focus firing) gets powered up!\n\nI really enjoyed this game, short as it was.  As I said, I beat it on easy right away, but playing it on hard proved a worthy challenge and I can see myself coming back to this game time and time again to get my bullet-hell fix.  Easily the best in the series (unless you really love the polarity swapping from Vampire), Jade Penetrate is a fast and fun shooter that will test your skill, coordination, and leave you begging for more.\n\nPros:\n\nBullet-hell (true curtain fire on hard) action!\nSatisfactory controller support\nGreat visuals\nGreat gameplay and mechanics\nFun, fair, and challenging\nNoob-friendly features like autobomb\nAuto-slow function (hold fire to focus fire) nice addition\n\nCons:\n\nNo leaderboard support (just high scores which glitched for me and didn't save)\nReplay function also glitched for me...\nFramerate slowdown (nostalgic of the older bullet-hell games, but come on)\nA little short, no unlockables or secondary characters, only high score running\n\nWhile the music wasn't *as* good as Vampire's soundtrack, Jade Penetrate is a worthy bullet-hell shooter for any shmup fan's collection.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Wolfinsin/recommended/207400/","Wolfinsin","Wolfinsin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Wolfinsin/","232 products in account","Well, I have quite a bit to say about this game. First, I shall give mention to it's predecessors. The previous two games in the franchise (that are available on Steam) 'Exceed: Gun Bullet Children' and 'Exceed: Vampire REX' Are nothing to write home about. The first one, I would barely describe as playable. It's an untranslated mess, but that's not the focus of this review. The third game is by far, the best of all three I have played. First I shall note what I consider good about this game;\nMy favourite part of the game is the soundtrack. it is absolutely brilliant, it blends synths with rock instruments for a seldom heard style. The next point I want to touch on is possibly the most important one in any Bullet Hell Shooter-style game. The attack patterns of the enemies are varied and interesting. While the standard enemies may not have particularly outstanding attacks, the bosses have many impressive attack patterns to display. Each boss is structed into a four or five stage battle. When you have depleted the boss's health bar it will change it's attack pattern. As you deplete more health bars they will be reduced at a quicker rate, but the attack's will become more varied and difficult to avoid. The final 'outstanding' positive point is the character design and sprites. They pretty much speak for themselves, as generic as they may be they are endearing to say the least.\n\nNow on the negatives;\nAs is the problem with most Bullet Hell Shooters, the backgrounds are unexciting and bland. While the development teams for these games are generally small it does not excuse such lackluster work.\nAs for another negative point, the interface is cramped and hard-to-read. The red text on black background can be hard on the eyes at times. The screen of the actual game could have a wider ratio, but that's not something withing my control.\nAlso, the arrow keys are not a sensitive enough method of control for some of the delicate movements required to dodge some of the enemy missiles.\n\nIn summary,\nIt is a fun casual experience that should not be followed for any 'story' as such. It is frantic, occasionally stressful fast-paced gameplay that is not for the easily bored. It requires good hand-eye coordination. While it could be argued as a Touhou rip off, which it undoubtedly is, there is only so much originality you can out into a Bullet Hell Shooter. With some endearing, sometimes unintentionally amusing voice acting it makes for an enjoyable package. And one word of warning, never take your finger off the 'Z' key!\nThanks for reading!\n~Wolfinsin (11th April 2014)","April 11, 2014","true","5.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Yes if you like danmaku (bullet hell) or would like to give the subgenre a try. No if you don't like the genre, moe-ish art, or games that go straight to gameplay without much lore, exposition, etc.\n\nIt has a very interesting way to provide challenge when it comes to patterns: Unlike touhou, which relies heavily on pure dodging/zoning, and on understanding boss-specific mechanics, eXceed 3rd attempts most of the time to scare or impress the player with the illusion of danger, rather than relying on pure execution on the player's part. A lot of patterns will look very tricky at first, but become really smooth to adapt to as they unravel, providing sudden, wide openings.\nLess pixel-tight, grazing-heavy gameplay, and more observation and planning in general, compared to touhou.\n\n+ Good soundtrack, not groundbreaking (using chord progressions that are popular in japanese osts and compos, without straying too far) but gives a really enjoyable and fitting ambience to the game\n+ Decent and evolutive level design (the difficulty curve is really smooth, unlike touhou which often provides one with bosses that are too difficult or easy for their stage)\n+ Really simple to understand and get used to, making it perfect for beginners who would like to get into bullet hell shmups without getting curbstomped by irregular difficulty curves and complex or unclear mechanics\n+ Enjoyable feedback (depending on whether one will find the ridiculous amount of bonus pellets dropped by enemies a bothering eyesore, or a constant, positive stimulus)\n+ Light fanservice, OK voice-acting\n+ Replayability. Sh'mups like this one depend heavily on one's willingness to try higher difficulty levels.\n+ Beautiful bullet patterns (which is a thing in many bullet hell shooters), even though they sometimes lack originality and aren't comparable to touhou's breathtaking patterns)\n\n- Soundtrack does not loop smoothly, leaving in audio blanks which completely break the ambience and immersion\n- Soundtrack sometimes doesn't even loop at all (looking at you, Celestia!), which is really awkward\n- Forced, extremely small resolution\n- Capped at 30fps, and poorly optimized (framedrops to ~15fps on 2015 middle-end machines when specific particles appear, for example when a boss dies)\n- Seems to be a trend with sh'mups by very small japanese studios: Character artwork quality is bad (Often broken anatomy, perspective and shading/volume). At least it doesn't reach ZUN-levels of bad\n- Character design is often quite bland\n- Quite short (stages and bosses are in general shorter than what one can find in touhou and the likes), even though the replayability\n","May 25","true","1.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While there have been some recent additions like Ikaruga and Danmaku Unlimited 2, the selection isn't anywhere near what I'd call satisfactory. Thanks(?) to the lack of releases I find myself spending a little time with Jade....Penetrate...Black...Package....uh..okay then.\n\nThe storyline is about what you'd expect from a shmup, absolute swill. You're playing these games to dodge bullets and get high-scores anyway. There are multiple stages with bosses at the end of each. These bosses have several forms and numerous bullet patterns to fling at you. Like most doujin shooters, the bullet patterns are immense in their density but don't move very quickly. You don't have to be a veteran of the genre to get far in this game. The scoring system revolves around medal-chaining and multipliers. It's not quite as deep as an arcade shooter but it does the job.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned eXceed 3rd is the only game in the series worth playing. This is because rather than being completely inept & frustrating (eXceed 1) or a poor man's Ikaruga (eXceed 2), this game focuses on what makes doujin bullet-hells work. Pick it up, play it, enjoy it.\n\nWhile we'd all love to make more jokes about black packages, it should be mentioned that originally this game was just Jade Penetrate. It's an earlier version that's very different, and it is more difficult with faster bullet patterns. The "Black Package" is akin to Cave and their habit of adding "Black Label" to different versions of their games. Unfortunately you'll have to look outside Steam if you want to play the original eXceed 3rd. It's more likely to be an overall better game if you're looking for a challenge. I guess most of Black Package's difficulty comes from the scoring system, I cleared the game on my first attempt(and by cleared I mean without using continues).\n\nOverall though JDBP isn't too bad a game. I've certainly played worse in the genre.","March 24, 2014","true","1.4"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Taking a big turn from the mechanics in the 2nd game, 3rd goes back to the old style of GBC but adding a few things. You can have "options" by picking up the powerups aka the little dragoons. Rapidly hitting the fire button will get you a fairly wide shot and also have the options fire straight ahead, going into slow-mo will give Rayne a more concentrated shot and make the options auto-aim at targets. Grazing is back as that will allow a meter to build up and then you can fire multiple homing shots at the enemies. There are 2 types of bombs, a regular bomb which has a hit range of 1-2x above your character. There is also a death bomb which has a range of 0-1x above your char and lasts significantly less time.\n\nThis is the Black edition, so it's actually a lot easier than the vanilla eXceed 3rd, I think capcom should have bundled them together.","August 25, 2013","true","8.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It isn't incompetently made and you'll likely have fun with it, I just can't help but think about how much better other Danmaku games are compared to this.\n\nFor instance, there is no indicator at the bottom of the screen that tracks the boss's movement so you can focus on avoiding bullets while still dealing damage. Something that I thought was an integral part of all Danmaku experiences.\n\nIn terms of content, it seems lacking in that too. Only one playable character with a pretty boring and basic playstyle? Compare that to any one of the Touhou games with its many playable characters and interesting attack options.\n\nI'm not impressed by the music either. Get this on sale if you must, but you'd do better to hold out for when the Touhou games eventually make their way to Steam.","January 16, 2015","true","1.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The killer soundtrack blends with the patterns so well that you'll feel like melting in this fantastic shmup experience.

The simple mechanics are exactly the same (bomb, focus, bomb reset on death) except you get only one character, that gets to do more damage with up to 5 options you collect through the game.

The Final of the eXceed's, and my lord does it NOT dissapoint. From bullet patterns that will make you graze to high heven, to a soundtrack garenteed to get your blood pumping and motervated, this game is a pretty great example of what makes the 'bullet hell' style shooter so good. 5+1 stages are going to test your ablity to adapt and learn,  but at least you arent defenceless. Like the last two games, you have a 'charge' attack, this time earned by bullet grazing and dealing damage, but unlike the last game, no longer acts like a bomb, rather returns more close towards how the first game played with it's own bomb pool. You also because of this have far less lives, and aren't gained via score, but by gathering so many pick ups. If nothing else, I highly recommend this one outright, by ITSELF if you raher not pony up the extra $5 for the entire pack.","August 21, 2013","true","9.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It invokes a sense of nostalgia from when I used to go to arcades as a little kid and play Galaga, space invaders, and all those retro classics. The game is very responsive and has a high frame rate which I was shocked sice most games like these ussualy play 30 fps and under.\n\nThe voice acting is very good, the story is decent for what it is (English Translation). The characters are beautifully drawn out in the dialog scenes and make it feel more like managa/anime. What I like even more is the different traits each character has when drawn, some are gothic, cute, nerdy... Just overall very well done charcter development through the use of artistic means/dialog.\n\nI would reccomend this game to anyway who enjoys the occasional arcade game, if you have a joystick (I almost guarantee you don't) then I would use it because it would make it alot more fun.\n\nMy only con with this game is the price, as I'm writing this review I'm not sure what the exact price is but it was previously $4.99. Don;t buy it not on sale, because when it's on sale you can get all three for $2.99 and it makes it that much more fun and more bang for your buck.","October 26, 2013","true","1.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It takes too much time in between levels.\n\nThis is probably the most unique and strategic of the three eXceed games. Instead of sticking with the bullet abosrbing idea from the second game, eXceed 3rd goes back to using bullet grazing to fill your special meter. But it adds a couple new mechanics to make the game more interesting. Killing certain enemies gives you a Tiamat, which follows you around and shoots at the enemy. Generally, these Tiamats shoot straight ahead. However, when you push the button that slows your movement, it also changes your shooting style. Your main gun becomes more narrow, and seems to do more damage, and the Tiamats lock on to an enemy and fire lazers directly at that enemy until it is dead. This is especially handy during boss fights. Slow movement helps you dodge bullets, and you deal damage faster if you can get your narrow beam on the boss.\n\n\nA possible con is the length of the boss fights. In previous games, bosses had about 3 life meters. The boss would change their shooting style whenever their health was depleted. In this game, bosses seem to have around 6 life meters, each with different bullet patterns. I guess that can be either good or bad, depending on your preference.\n\nI probably wouldn't pay full price for this, but its a fun game if you find it on sale.","December 5, 2013","true","1.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I picked it up on a whim, and I'm glad I did.  It's frantic fun from beginning to end.  I have a minor gripe with all the fan-servicey stuff, but to be fair, the game knows it's crowd, and gives them exactly what they want.  I can't really fault it for that.  Also, on the plus side, you can switch off the dialouge so the action just starts, and a noobie like me wasn't even able to take the split-second to notice that I was playing as a flying girl.  THERE'S JUST TOO MANY BULLETS!  Then again, that's what we're here for, right?\n\nThis one is the best out of the three, and it has a ♥♥♥♥♥in' soundtrack (they all do, really, but this one is the best imo).  The only big issue I have is with random frame rate drops.  The menu runs at maybe 10fps for some reason.  My PC isn't the best, but come on.  On the other hand, my friend's laptop runs it perfectly fine.  A lot of people have this issue, and there is some work-arounds, but it is an overall pain in the ♥♥♥ to fix.  The game itself runs ok for me, but that menu screen... I mean, damn.  All three games have this problem.\n\nIt's easy to pick up and then put down, and it isn't some non-challenging casual game at the same time.  Perfect time-killer, and crazy fun if you are really into this kind of thing.","April 28, 2014","true","9.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It turns out that the third game in the series is probably the worst.\n\nWhile the second game made some minor improvements over the first, eXceed 3rd - Jade Penetrate Black Package is the most basic out of the three games. The anime style artwork and characters continue being shallow and meaningless, appearing as 10 year old girls with breasts and showing underwear. The voice acting is the same as before, with the voices of children screaming at each other constantly through gameplay. The bullets are still abstract and indescribable. For this third iteration of the game, the developers decided it would be a good idea to add incredibly large "coins" that drop from enemies in very high amounts, taking up most of the screen. Something else that did not occur in the previous two games in the series but now happens often in eXceed 3rd - Jade Penetrate Black Package are the major frame rate drops during certain parts of the levels. This happens in every level.\n\nThe resolution continues being really low in addition to the well below amateur level of graphic and sound design. Everything about this game is awful from beginning to end. The fact that Capcom associates themselves with this rubbish is depressing. The developers expecting people to pay money for something this bad is a joke.\n\neXceed 3rd - Jade Penetrate Black Package is awful.","February 17, 2015","false","1.2"," 1 of 9 people (11%) found this review helpful","11","1","9","0","0"

Boss fights are way too long. The music is not looped properly; it would end the track fading it into silence then start it again, which feels disturbing.\n\nI vote 'No' because I think the game should be about having fun, and I didn't really have fun with this game. May be later, when I find it in myself to play more, I will like the game more, than I'll change my opinion, but as of now, I don't really like this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GracedbyAutumn/recommended/207400/","GracedbyAutumn","Graced by Autumn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GracedbyAutumn/","800 products in account","From Tennen-Sozai comes eXceed 3rd: Jade Penetrate Black Package, an updated version of what was originally the third and final game in Japanese doujin studio FLAT's three-game long series. Although Jade Penetrate doesn't quite live up to the standards set by the last game, still does an excellent job of providing a satisfying bullet hell experience, complete with a cast of characters that look like they've walked straight out of a NIS game.\n\nDespite the implication in the game's title that eXceed 3rd is a direct sequel to eXceed 2nd, one doesn't in fact need any prior experience with either of the previous eXceed games in order to understand the happenings of the game's plot.  eXceed 3rd follows the young half-dragon, half-demon wizard Rayne Lindwurm as she enters the tournament for the chance to win the title of 'Demon Lord' and become ruler of the realm. As with most shumps, Lindwurm's motivations and reasons for joining the tournament take a backseat role to make room for the action. The most exposure the plot gets comes primarily from the short conversations that manifest just before each boss encounter in which Lindwurm and her opponent exchange a few words before going at it. All of these scenes are fully-voiced in Japanese with English subtitles and do a nice job of breaking up the action without dragging on for too long. The story itself isn't particularly interesting, and almost all of the characters; including Lindwurm herself; are anime/JRPG archetypes, but this isn't a major issue given that eXceed has always been more about gunning down waves of demons and less about trying to figure out how many of its characters were cut straight from a narrative template.\n\nAcross each of the game's five stages, the player guides Lindwurm as she tears through scores of lesser demons summoned by the other contestants. At the player's disposal is the bog-standard, forward-firing attack with a wide spread, a variation of the said attack that can be directed toward a single enemy while remaining mobile and a powerful homing attack that needs to be charged up by collecting the items left behind by fallen foes. Acquiring a specific type of power-up also grants the player the aid of Lindwurm's familiars - dragon-like creatures who follow our protagonist in formation whilst adding to her firepower. Knowing when and where to use each of these is crucial to mastering each stage and conserving one's supply of lives. When the going gets tough, you can rely on the ever-helpful bombs to bail you out of trouble with their screen-clearing explosions that wipe the field clean of bullets and enemies alike.\n\nWhile the game is indeed very short, eXceed's main appeal comes from attempting to clear the entire game on a single credit, and eventually a single life. Replaying stages over in the Training mode allows one to become familiar with what awaits them in each level, before choosing to tackle every stage in sequence to watch your time spent practice pay off yields a sense of great accomplishment and satisfaction. There's nothing quite like playing a stage a few times over while memorizing bullet patterns and the positions of enemies before heading into the main game and clearing the same stage without losing so much as a single life.\n\nThe game is easily the most graphically advanced entry in the series to date and boasts a visceral soundtrack that accompanies the on-screen action. eXceed 3rd Jade Penetrate Black Package may fall short of reaching the standards set by its predecessor, but it's still a game well worth playing. At the price tag of £3, there aren't many reasons not to take eXceed for a spin.","July 5, 2014","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/avicibell/recommended/207400/","avicibell","avicibell","http://steamcommunity.com/id/avicibell/","15 products in account","The third game in the series is where they really got it right in my opinion, it retains the simplistic approach of 1 but does away with all the empty screens and frankly boring gameplay to mix it with the enemy density and craziness from 2. From 2 it does away with the polarity system, instead adding a very welcome slow down key that also focuses your shooting, actual bombs (tho it retains the mana bombs) and power ups.\n\nIf you were to compare it to anything it'd be to touhou or seihou since the mechanics are very similar where shooting, power ups, grazing and so on are concerned. The difference with those games are in the addition of mana bombs, in stage length, where these ones are generally shorter and more hectic and in the voice acting - not only from the dialogue with bosses but also while playing normally, such as when you use a mana bomb, regular bomb, meet a mini boss and so on. It makes the characters more alive despite not really understanding what they're saying, althought you can guess the intent from the tone.\n\nAs far as difficulty is concerned this is probably easier than most touhou games, your hitbox is more forgiving and enemy patterns are generally not terribly arcane with a few exceptions. The comparison breaks down where the extra stage is concerned however, since it's not really a separate mode like in touhou and seihou but instead demands you to pass through the whole game first before attempting it.\n\nThe music is top notch, the stages are not as linked to it as in touhou perhaps (where you'd see a huge wave of enemies or the appearance of a midboss coinciding with a crescendo or a beat drop in the music) but it doesn't take away from how brilliant it is. It has rather clear rock/metal vibe as well, which you can tell in the final boss' theme, "Intersect Thunderbolt" if you would like to listen to a track first.\n\nVisually there are no issues, all the enemies are clear, the shots are very distinct from the background (without the usual problem of a bunch of small red shots over a red background we've all suffered in other bullet hells) and your character has a clearly defined hitbox in her center. Item drops do not interfere either, since they are instantly grabbed as soon as they spawn, minimizing the problems of confusing or straight up covering stray bullets.\nAn issue however is with the power up system, as you grab power ups small dragons appear and follow you around, complementing your shooting. Sometimes you might confuse them with your character, especially in full screen mode.\n\nAnd finally as far as the plot goes they rebooted the series and turned it into some sort of school war where the top students fight for a chance to compete in a tournament for a chance to become some monster big shot or other. It's not nearly as dramatic as the last two games and in my opinion it's a step down from the pseudo evangelion thing they had going on in the last two games, but the characters are still very distinct and charming at least.\n\nOverall if you want a bullet hell and you don't have this game, you want this game. Simple as that.","October 8, 2015","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sometimes you get powerup drops (like more bombs and mini-tiamats which serve as automated turrets that attack their own targets while you fire).\n\nAs for story, I don't think it relates to the previous games. You just fight challengers in the tournament to represent your region(?) and then it ends teasing that there are harder challenges ahead as representative.\n\nWhat's nice in this game (and not in 1 or 2) is that there's a dot marker on your character to see exactly what part of your character needs to dodge the bullets. I played on easy and it felt pretty generous with the hurtbox (I'm pretty sure I didn't avoid everything weaving left and right between bullets). Also, your speed is significantly slower while firing. The slow speed is sometimes nice for weaving through some bullets but there are also times you need the speed to cross the screen quickly (like to change targets avoid certain bullet patterns). There is a separate slow button to slow you down without firing but I don't understand when I wouldn't just use the attack button instead.\n\nHowever, unlike 2, boss fights don't show life meters (with more bars for more phases) so you don't know how long the boss fight will last unless you memorize how many phases they have. Also, it doesn't bring the polarity mechanic from 2 which I thought was pretty fun.\n\nI'm not really into bullet hells, but I played this on easy and had a fun enough time playing through. There are patterns you can memorize and progress further by changing up your tactics. In my opinion, I liked 2 the best, 3 a little less (only because 2 has the polarity mechanic), and 1 leagues behind. It's worth a try if you like bullet hells.","July 25, 2015","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
