"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/320110/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2973 products in account","I was planning to write an in-depth review of Train Town, but unfortunately the game isn’t exactly what I thought it would be and therefore it is shorter than what I originally imagined. Let me elaborate:\n\nTrain Town is a game meant for the younger gamers among us. I guess I could say ‘creative’, young gamers, but in my opinion you’re usually already more creative when you are really young than later in life when you’re a bit older. Anyway, let’s get back on track here (*giggles*).\nThis piece of software has no single-player mode. There is no campaign. It’s up to the player to create all sorts of levels using their own imagination. It’s quite simple, actually. You place the tracks, obstacles and finally a train - you can even change the weather - and then you just watch your train ride around. Or blow up, if you decide to place some gas tanks on the tracks..\nThere are plenty of objects to place around and you could build a pretty good and detailed level if you just put enough time in it. The levels themselves, however, are pretty small, so no, you can’t build entire worlds, but a small city wouldn’t be out of the question I think.\nAnd, if you’re not in the mood to create your own level, you can always download one or more from the tens of already available levels. They’re instantly playable and if you don’t like something you see you can edit it to your liking.\n\nThe game originates from the Android operating system and, except for one major flaw, seems to be faithfully ported to the Windows OS. The camera tutorial text still hasn’t been updated to PC controls and as a result the game tells you how to pinch and zoom in on the screen using your fingers. A big no-no in my book.\n\nI have to admit that the game does look cheerful. It uses lots of colors, and it looks pretty good from a distance. Just don’t zoom in too much, because the textures are a bit blurry. The objects also don’t use a lot of details and you can definitely tell that it focuses on a younger target audience. But they usually don’t care about this sort of stuff anyway.\nThe game has happy music, and it’s the kind of music that reminded of some TV shows when I was young. No, this music won’t bring you down. I enjoyed it.\n\nYou could play Train Town for a couple of minutes or even for an entire day without getting bored by it. But I really think you have to be part of a younger audience to fully appreciate it. Serious gamers will not care for this. And to be honest, they shouldn’t. The lack of a campaign is sorely missed and it’s the one thing that could’ve made this game a little more interesting for the rest of us gamers.\nStill, kids should have a good time with this.\n\n[Rating: 58/100]","September 4, 2014","false","1.0"," 35 of 46 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","35","46","0","2"

Bought this for my 4 year old. He had a great time, we'll play more I'm sure.\n\nYou build train tracks, put down buildings, rocks, trees, people, and more. Lots of objects to choose from so you can be creative. The building controls are dead simple. Just a few menus that let you place objects, change their size and rotation, change the weather, all basic stuff that works well.\n\nThen you choose a train and drive it around the track. When the train hits anything it explodes, so there is lots of fun to be had creating some big destruction. The train controls are almost nonexistent - just pick your train and it starts to move, all you can do is change the speed. But that’s enough, it’s not as much of a game as it is a playset.\n\nYou can download tracks that others have made, and that’s a good way to get into some instant action. You can share your tracks too.\n\nThe visuals are nice. Bright and colourful, music and sound aren’t annoying. All in all a nice package. For $3, totally worth it if you have a kiddo who likes trains.","August 28, 2014","true","1.6"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","16","20","0","0"

There are no goals, just build a track layout, drop some objects here and there, and then watch your train(s) drive endlessly in circles. Until it hits a gastank and the train flies all over the place! That's the "sort of funny" part I was talking about earlier but it can only keep you entertained for so long... :)\nI just can't recommend this game, it feels way too empty to enjoy it for a longer time. It's one of those games that when you get it somewhere for free it's funny to fool around in it for a short moment and then never touch it again.","November 2, 2014","false","0.2"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

Instead of laying track, you set connection points for the track, making it incredibly easy for shaping the layout without having to worry about making realistic turns.  Various decorations can be laid out all over the terrain, including on the tracks themselves.  When a train collides with a decoration, or another train, both fly in to the air in a cartoonish mess with wild physics.  If you don't feel like making your own layout, there are various prefab layouts you can download and alter as you wish.  Older children may find the entire setup oversimplistic, or lack of realistic decor bland.  On the flip side, you don't need need to be a seasoned model railroader to pick it up and play it with your kids.","December 23, 2014","true","0.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Whatever your expectation, you really won't get anything from it.\n\nIt's like a baby simulation that doesnt really have any physical rules.   There's really nothing to the game but an open (tiny) sandbox and an ability to lay a track and scenery items.  The problem is there's no real logic to any of this, it's just about randomly plopping junk onto a small screen, and then .... watching in boredom.\n\nI have three sons, aged almost 2, 3.5 and 5.5 .. and they all were bored to tears by this non-game.\n\nIt was clearly a dodgy little iPhone game, and they thought "maybe we can make some $$$ launching this on Steam".  When porting for the PC, the developer didn't even bother to update basic text .. the controls all say "touch this", or "swipe your finger to the left".\n\nI wouldn't ordinarily write a review unless a game were truly superb or utterly utterly crap.\n\n.... save your money, if you want a nice learning train game for kids you can get Sid Meiers RAILROADS, or a bunch of simulators out there, some real world, some kiddy oriented.\n\nBut this game is awful, a total fraud, ripoff, DO NOT BUY.","August 30, 2014","false","0.4"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","15","24","0","0"

They wanted more time while playing, but were happy to do something more fun and less limiting when an alternative was provided.  You could say, "Oh, but they're being creative."  However, I feel like my kids are WAY more creative when I just open up Paint.  Why have them play this game when they can be less limited, and have more fun with almost anything else?\n\nHonestly, you don't have many options.  Lay out the track.  Place down objects.  Choose a train.  There is some interaction between objects.  For example, your train can run over the orcs, exploding them into green goo.  Trains can crash into eachother or other objects, throwing them off the track.  You can speed up, slow down, and reverse your trains.  The sandbox has a very limited area, too.\n\nThe interface is also lousy.  You want to make a road?  Then you have to click and rotate every square inch of it.  There are little car objects, some of which will try to stay on the road.  However, putting together a road is offensively tedious (Did anyone playtest this thing?).  My kids just put random slabs of disconnected road all over the place.  They couldn't attain a level of creativity due to the interface tedium.\n\nThis game is a straight port from a smartphone game.  No improvements, no adjustments.\n\nHonestly, buying this will send the message that people should carelessly "port" more phone games to steam without making them actual PC games.  Just don't do it, please.","October 6, 2014","false","2.2"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

They have to be someone who likes creating a world without that world actually doing something, they have to be interested in creating by putting down pre-made objects rather than trying to make their own thing, and they have to be content with small sandboxes rather than constantly building on a new world.\n\nWhich is to say, the game is much too limited to really be the kind of game you can just give to kids straight-off.
