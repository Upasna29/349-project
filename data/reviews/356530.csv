With gorgeous high quality artwork, great writing and enjoyable soundtrack, there's very little I can complain about when it comes to this gem among OELVNs.\n\nIn this fictional world of royalty, nobles and commoners, it's the firstborn daughter who inherits the family title, wealth and privilege while the sons must court a wife of similar rank in which to take over, so to speak, power of her household or kingdom.  Queens are referred to as Wisdoms and serve as official advisors to their Kings, an interesting play on the "behind every great man is an even greater woman" saying.  Princesses are groomed for this role so that one day they may provide their own wisdom to the King, assisting him in ruling the kingdom effectively and benevolently.\n\nWith this setting in mind, our story begins with Prince Oscar of Oceandawyr preparing for the Aniversari celebrations of Princess Cassidy of Gwellinor.  Among rival princes, he will meet and prospectively court the young princess in the hopes of perhaps winning her hand and Gwellinor's throne.  Madeleine Valois, the second-born daughter of a minor noble house, who through chance of circumstance was awarded the position of Oscar's handler many years prior, has groomed and prepared him for this moment.  Protecting his interests in all things, even to the point of dying for her young master, if needed, her loyalty, devotion and friendship is rivaled by none.  But all of that is put to the test as they both find themselves embroiled in a deadly game of politics with Madeleine's future hanging in the balance.\n\nValois' personality and character development is one of the things that makes the story work so well.  Here we have a strong, smart, and for lack of a better word, kick ♥♥♥ woman who underneath it all is still caring and gentle when she needs to be.  And although she tries to place logic and reason before all, behind a facade of composure and control there's a woman who has wants and desires, fears for the future, and the dream to one day have her own family, something that seems entirely unattainable in her current situation.  Female protagonist or not, anyone reading this novel should have no problem understanding and relating to her in some way.\n\nEach supporting character is just as interesting as Madeleine.  Despite leaning towards standard tropes, they are written uniquely enough to break out of the generic moulds from which they come.  This is refreshing in a genre that relies far too heavily on stereotypes.  It helps that our prospective beaus (and belle, in the case of the maid) are not met with yet another timid and malleable heroine, their actions and reactions reflecting as much.\n\nThe story itself is intrigue-filled with a healthy dose of action sprinkled in.  Piecing together details, formulating theories and guessing at the ultimate outcome only to be shocked as events take a turn for the unexpected, you'll be hooked before you realize it.  The four character routes tell a separate piece of the story, and it's not until you've made it through them all that the how, the what and the why are revealed.  I loved this aspect of the storytelling, although it almost requires a specific route order to get the full effect of the revelations; but I assure you the payoff is well worth it.\n\nFor the guys trying to decide if this "girl's romance" is worth a shot - yes, it most certainly is!  Granted, there is a good bit of romance tossed in, including some pretty steamy situations (this is an otoge after all), but don't let that dissuade you from experiencing an engrossing tale of political intrigue and betrayal.\n\nThe presentation here is excellent with gorgeously detailed artwork and appealing UI.  Of note are the completely redone background images that are far and away better than the originals.  Detail and color come together to complement the character sprites which initially clashed against the sketchiness of the originals.  Event CGs are also extremely well drawn with some beautiful and emotive imagery that truly enhances the story.  These images are accompanied by a very ethnic-sounding acoustic soundtrack with Spanish guitar at its base lending an air of gentility to the game setting.  A minor aside, I really enjoyed the French word usage for some of the terminology; such a small effect goes a long way in establishing a convincing courtly atmosphere.\n\nI really cannot champion The Royal Trap enough.  If you enjoy well-crafted visual novels, you need this one in your library.  The price is very reasonable for the quality and length (13 hours to complete all 15 endings is not bad at all).  This is the second time I have played through the entire game, the first over a year ago, and I certainly see myself coming back to re-experience it again in the future.  Do yourself a favor and grab this gem when you can, don't wait for a sale or bundle, The Royal Trap is one visual novel that's definitely worth the full price.\n\nBottom Line: Recommended for all visual novel fans who appreciate well written stories with quality presentation behind it.","April 9, 2015","true","13.5"," 145 of 152 people (95%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","95","145","152","7","10"

As being one of Hanako's later games, The Royal Trap: The Confines Of The Crown is a marvelously elaborate adventure of royalty, politics, romance, intrigue and alliances in a late medieval fantasy realm - and probably Hanako's best game yet in my personal opinion.\n\nOur story revolves around Madeleine Valois, a noble born young woman coming from an insignificant family, raised to attend Prince Oscar of Ocendawyr as his valette - a companion, an advisor, an agent and a maidservant. For the occasion of Princess Cassidy's aniversari - a celebration for the coming of age and a hosting various suitors to secure her future - Madeleine accompanies Oscar to the neighboring kingdom of Gwellinor. Considering the validity of a female heir is the central power for royalty in this setting, an already fierce race for the hand of Princess Cassidy is on. Yet, Madeleine will also find herself in a web of intrigues threatening not only the integrity of the crown, but the security of her own and her companions. As dangerous gossip concerning many secrets runs within the halls of royal palace, Madeleine tries to choose her allies carefully for her own means. Will she manage to dissolve the web of intrigue, or simply become a part of it to survive?\n\nOverall, The Royal Trap is one of the best otome games both in means of an original setting and story elaboration that I've ever seen. The world and its various ways are depicted befitting 16th century power politics through heirs, names, titles and land with many anecdotes appropriately arranged into a unique setting. All characters are portrayed well beyond skin deep with profound personalities and background. They all are depicted with certain demeanors to establish certain means with unique abilities; possessing dreams, aims, insecurities and hopes which makes every one of them interesting and credible as a personality, breaking out of common stereotypes. Even the most ordinary of them possess their own depths with well written story elaboration.\n\nOur protagonist, Madeleine is most certainly not our everyday shy and helpless heroine. She is a relatable and able personality with her stature, her training and her character. She is a smart and strong young woman who keeps both her wits and her charms about her. An incredible social player with an ability to observe, analyze and assess situations in the blink of an eye. She is calculating with a novel sense of duty and responsibility, yet she still carries her own worries and desires for the future silently. Her chosen interactions are various and always consistent with her traits. Our job here is to reveal what part of Madeleine's substantial personality will become victorious by the end through our choices. Each and every ending you may acquire feels probable and satisfying with the given personality, which is a masterful feat to accomplish in this genre.\n\nFor display purposes, artworks are genuinely beautiful anime style and CGs themselves are various with suitable expressions. There is no voice acting for any part, yet the soundtrack already establishes a rich and driving atmosphere through a gripping narrative - both describing actual events and commentating on Madeleine's train of thought. It's like reading a really good story with beautiful pictures presented on the side.\n\nThe game has 15 different endings - and a truckload of choice options - presenting alternatives for Madeleine's future and each one sheds some more light to the secrets within palace chambers. I'd highly recommend playing The Royal Trap: The Confines Of The Crown for every otome gamer and for whom would appreciate a good visual novel about court politics.

I originally played Royal Trap last year so I knew what to expect from the game, generally, but was excited to see the additions that were made in this version.  I've only finished one route so far but I'mreally pleased in the way the expanded dialogue and text fleshes out the world and the characters in a more comprehensive manner.\n\nSo, with Royal Trap, there's actually 15 different endings: 3 endings per "normal" route, 2 endings on the "hidden" route, and an "alone" route where you don't pursue a relationship. I really enjoyed all four of the "normal" routes, particularly Oscar's which seems to have the most information and action, in terms of world-building (though I assume that's changed some in this version!).\n\nOne thing that makes the setting of the game really unique is that Royal Trap sets up the universe such that there's an interesting hint of matriarchy, in that the power is held by women within the story. I also appreciated that there's actually LGBTQ representation in the game, with two routes that let you choose women and three that let you choose men. There's also more representation specifically with the character of Cassidy, though I don't want to go too in depth as it'll spoil a large portion of the story.","April 5, 2015","true","1.0"," 33 of 38 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","33","38","0","0"

And I really liked it! I just failed to get one ending without internets help, it required very specific choices.\n\nPro's\n\n- Very good intriguing story. To get the whole picture you must play all of the storylines, which are 16 if I remember correctly, but it is worth it!\n- Some of the endings are really unexpected which I liked a lot!\n- Your choices actually change the story quite a lot. They are no minor choices, at least most of them and will change the ending most definetely.\n- The skip system is great, it allows you to skip everything that you have already seen and stops automatically when you encounter something new. Very good especially if you play all storylines in about 3 days and you do not want to see the same things constantly.\n- Art is really nice, especially the ones you can unlock in every storyline and can find back in the gallery\n- Most characters are interesting and they all get some time in the spotlight and you learn interesting background stories for most of them\n- The music is good, especially the battle music. I did not like all of it at first but it grows on you.\n\nCons\n\nNot many cons, and most of them are probably personal but here goes.\n- I did not like the fact that after all endings there were still questions unanswered, however possibly some people do not mind this.\n- Bonus or true ending would have been nice, of course not game breaking or a real criticism, just would have been cool\n- I cannot think of any real criticism I just really liked it\n\nJust note that the game has no gameplay besides the choices, so if you do not like that than this is not the game for you.\nIf you love visual novels, you will love this!","November 12, 2015","true","7.9"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","24","26","0","0"

The story is compelling, and the characters interesting. One issue that is often present with these types of games is that the female protagonist comes across as clueless or hopelessly naive, even outright daft. They often come across as a hollow shell, with now real life or motivation beyond that which the player ascribes to them. Happily this is not the case with 'Royal Trap'. Maddie is interesting and compelling, she is also competent and engaging. While there are occasions where she requires assistance or co-operation from others, this still remains on her terms, and she never falls into the 'damsel in distress' trope.\n\nThe game has great replayability since you only get the WHOLE story by playing the different routes. Each route (after the initial set up) is quite different, rather than a slight change in dialogue choices.\n\nMy only complaint is that my favourite route is not unlocked until your second playthrough. I didn't realise this and wound up with the bad ending, because the options I needed to take to avoid it, weren't available. So lesson learned: Save pursuing Callum till a later play through.\n\nAll in all I loved the game and heartily recommend it.","May 18, 2015","true","26.6"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","16","19","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shewolfoffrance/recommended/356530/","shewolfoffrance","SheWolfOfFrance","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shewolfoffrance/","12 products in account","I liked this game A LOT. Intuitive, intriguing, humorous, realitively well written... You should note that even though this is a "choose your oen adventure" its still a visual novel...with a heavy emphasis on the novel aspect. Its a lot of reading, and not a ton of choice making (especially in the first half). All the same, its quite enjoyable. Although there are (I think?) 15 different endings/tracks, there are only four that are REALLY different-- the others are variations of the four; however, with every track you take you get a bit more of the story, so you do have to complete pretty much all the ending for the the full circle of the plot. The characters are charming and unique to themselves, and each route is pleasing in a different way (Gaston's was my favorite-- very odd and humorous.). The main character is well-rounded and intellgent---something that I like to see in a female protagonist.\n\nThe replay-ablity is pretty good. The first and the third chapter (which are story heavy) are pretty much the same no matter the track, so they can be a bit tedious to get through, but the other 8 (or so?) will be different. The soundtrack is lovely; the art is strong in someplaces, and just sorta ok in others. This is also definitely not a dating sim, as many visual novels are. Several of the endings have a romance attached to them, but its harldly the focal point of the game.\n\nMy first playthrough took me about 2.5 hours. I'm sure you could go faster if you are more focused than I was (I was on a train with many distractions.)\n\nI paid full price for the game, I do not regret that. I would do it again.\n\nFor people wondering if this is like Long Live the Queen: No. Its not strategy based for one thing. The emphasis on this is story, not survival (with a bit of story mixed in). However, the quality I would say is the same. Just know that it doesn't require near as much brain power.\n\nP.S: Just for furter review validity, I want to mention that I have about 3 more hours of play time on this game that listed above. Dunno why it disappeared (maybe becasue I played it without being connected to the internet?

I was a bit dissapointed because I expected more of an action based plot & game, but overall the game is fairly good. I should also mention that my game time on record is not really 30 hrs, and is actually idle time where I left the game open - actual game length is closer to about 4-5 hours.\nI think the adventure genre on the store page should be dropped since there are not puzzles at all to solve, and no choices you can pick where you get a bad end or game over - you can just click through all the dialogue and get to an ending no matter what.\n\nI do not know why people compare the game to Game of Thrones in intrigue, because there is no real intrigue going on at all. The only revealation is not even surprising if you paid attention to the game title or what that character actually looks like.\nMost of the plot is predictable, and you can't actually choose your alliance till chapter 5 out of 7 -  there are 4 varied plots and they have 2 chapters each so it is bacially 5 + 8 chapters altogether.\n\nPros:\n+ There is some nice use of music and fits the scenes well for the most part.\n+ Some of the transitions were kind of cool.\n+ Characters for the most part have a fair bit of backstory and are reasonably fleshed out.\n+ Art is overall good, ending scenes were nicely done.\n+ The main story (Oscar) is a good read.\n\nCons:\n- The actual story does not change much at all depending on choices (I'm not comparing it to a Telltale game just in general), no matter what alliance you pick the game will mostly be the same, especially for Callum/Dolores. One ending where you can go indepedent is just a flat out bad ending - you are stuck to picking a romance if you want a good ending.\n- Princes could have been incorporated into the stories more rather than feeling like they vanish completely if don't select their route.\n- At times I just wanted to read through and get to the ending as fast as I could because I found some parts dull (chapter 6 in particular).\n- Some of the characters' motivations do not make sense, like how somebody will climb down a huge wall riksing death or try to get you killed over one line (barely different) that you choose. It seemed like it should be a bigger deal for one line to motivate those things. Some reactions to lines are odd too.\n- You are not Elodie form Save the Queen, you won't really need to do anything to survive, nothing to solve, no real dangers when you choose what to reply.\n- Cassidy is creepy. The nature of her is not, but how she came about, I always wanted to skip parts relating to her - it semeed like a forced character for plot sake.\n\nVerdict: As I mentioned the game is pretty short at around 5 hours with no real replayability (just make saves at choices) so I suggest you pick this up in a sale or a bundle if you want to play it. It is a nice VN, but you don't make impactful choices and the branching plots don't really branch out that much.","December 2, 2015","false","29.7"," 23 of 33 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","23","33","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/callistawhite/recommended/356530/","callistawhite","CallistaWhite","http://steamcommunity.com/id/callistawhite/","137 products in account","Without a doubt, The Royal Trap is one of the best visual novels that Hanako Games has ever produced, if it isn't one of the best VNs in general.  I played this game first when it came out on the developer's site and got very immersed in the story.  As others have already explained the basic storyline, I won't repeat that.  Rather, I'll point out what I loved about this game and why anyone who is fan of visual novels should include this one in their Steam library.\n\nFirst, the story is fantastic.  It is one of those rare ones where the female protagonist is actually smart and has quite the personality.  The flaw in some VNs is that the female protagonist is a clean slate and can come off appearing like an idiot.  However, that certainly isn't the case here.  You play as Madeleine Valois, a valette (assistant) to the prince of a small kingdom, and her job is to have her prince presented before the princess of another kingdom and make him appealing enough to be married to the princess.  In the world of The Royal Trap, it is the women who have the power because they can hold property while the men have to compete for the privilege of sharing that power.  Of course, things don't go exactly as planned and there are definitely hiccups along the way.  But enough about that, as I did state that I wouldn't reveal the storyline.  ;)\n\nAlong with the story, the artwork is beautiful.  The background art was completely redone for the Steam release.  Although I liked the background art before when the game first came out on Hanako Games, I absolutely was in awe when I saw the new art here.  All the extra effort to make the game as wonderful as it can be certainly paid off.\n\nAlso, I liked how not all of the paths are necessarily romance paths.  Personally, I wouldn't classify this game as an otome one because not all of the paths are romance ones.  There is a friendship path (although you sort of have to go on a romance one to get to the friendship path) and another path that can kind of be interpreted as a romance or friendship path, depending on how the player chooses to see it.  Most of the paths have a bad, normal, and happy end so there's definitely replayability value.  That's one of the factors I take into account when I decide whether it's worth it to buy a new VN.  There must be plenty of replayability value for me to want to go back and choose another path, make different choices, etc.\n\nIf there are any negative points in this game, I'll list a couple.  First, there are a few typos that I noticed although they were mainly on one path.  However, these could easily be ignored if you can get very immersed in the story.  The other negative is that there is a LOT of reading at times.  Madeleine will state out her thoughts in long text (in a monologue fashion) and people playing may have mixed feelings about that.  I liked reading the texts and getting to learn about Madeleine's thoughts and feelings but then I can see how others might tire or not have the patience to read long walls of text.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend this game to anyone who's a fan of visual novels and definitely anyone who's a fan of Hanako Games.  They've made great games in the past and this one is definitely a keeper.  :D","April 21, 2015","true","39.6"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

I got Nazagi's good end, even though it doesn't appear to be showing up in my achievements for this game, and it was really awesome. Not too idealistic, happily married after, but really engrossing.

I am a bit uncomfortable about how Cassidy came to be as she is (as in, not through her own choice and feelings, but then again, no child chooses how they're raised), but all that really matters is that she's happy and content in who she is.\nI think I'll try Dolores or Callum next, Oscar doesn't really interest me, although he's a sweetie, and Gaston kinda creeps me out.

I played The Royal Trap once before it came to Steam and thought of it as a cute, nicely written little VN, but nothing particularly more. I played it again when it came to Steam, wanting to collect some of the endings I'd missed, and only then realised just how clever and rich the story is.\n\nWithout playing it through more than once and making all of the correct choices in-game, you're unlikely to grasp the entire picture of the storyline. When I played it through the first time, I barely scratched the surface of the mystery and it's possible to do so more than once, finishing with only some of the puzzle pieces. Only some alliances and choices will afford you the whole story. That is what is so rewarding and intriguing about the experience. You can almost choose how involved you want to be, how much you want to learn, if you want the story to be a simple romance, or something more sinister. It took me two or even three playthroughs to undercover all of the pieces to the story.\n\nI was also disarmed by the surprisingly dark undertones in some parts of the storyline, many of them not greatly visible if you don't make certain choices. On the surface it seems like a sugary love story, but, to me at least, I found it to be much darker and more intriguing underneath. Some of the endings in particular are very... surprising, let's say.\n\nApart from the clever mystery and story, the music and visuals are lovely and understated, and the writing is solid, professional and atmospheric. And nicely polished. You'll be hard-pressed to find an atmosphere-ruining typo or spelling error. But it's definitely the story that I most enjoyed. Clever, intriguing, and equally absorbing on subsequent play-throughs.","April 15, 2015","true","14.8"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

While there aren't many choices available over the course of the game, the ones that do exist can have a dramatic impact - the game has 15 possible endings.  There are plenty of games out there that give many more choices but their choices have far less impact.  The Royal Trap thus provides an interesting case study in terms of a plot that can feel highly linear if one only plays it once, but which, on replay, with different choices, shows itself to have a truly branching narrative.  Plus, you know, romances and princes.  :)  If you enjoyed Long Live the Queen, as I did, you'll probably like this (though this game doesn't have the stat/skill element of LLtQ).","April 14, 2015","true","9.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

All the choices I make have to be the one I would find myself choosing should I be in the scenario myself, something that I found was easily done in this story - which only speaks wonders for the level of immersion I had.\n\nThis game has a lot of depth to it and was craftily done! The art and aesthetic is nice and pleasing, but most importantly fitting for the theme that the story follows: royalty and political intrigue. The soundtracks don’t transition too well from one to the other, but other than that suit the scenes beautifully and fitfully. The writing is witty and flowery in the right places, and the descriptions and reflections are apt and telling.\n\nRegarding the game itself, it has a couple of tricky branching paths that are to be expected for something of this complexity; choosing an innocuous choice now may change a later choice (which is the base mechanic of Visual Novels that properly implement choice) by some believable reason in the story, such as a missed opportunity or causing a reaction or implying something at the right moment. The endings commonly branch into happy, normal, and bad, and from what I see are easy to obtain by saving before the pinnacle choices (showing that getting there may be the problem).\n\nI see myself spending time to painstakingly go through all the branches and unlock the CGs and achievements and just see what exactly the novel has to offer in its entirety. While not something I would gush over and hype, I am more than willing to recommend this game and place it as one of the better constructed visual novels I’ve gone through.\n\nWell done!\n","December 4, 2015","true","5.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/octobig/recommended/356530/","octobig","Octobig","http://steamcommunity.com/id/octobig/","36 products in account","In The Royal Trap: The Confines of the Crown, you play as Madeleine Valois, valette to prince Oscar of Oceandawyr. This basically means that you keep the young prince out of trouble, spy for him, protect him and his interests, fight for him, and even die for him if necessary. The two of you have a close, playful relationship. As Oscar's royal duties take him to a nearby country to attend their princess' birthday celebrations, you of course accompany him. But inbetween making the princess fall for Oscar (and do you really want her to?) and sneaking through the hallways of the palace, you come across a deadly royal plot...\n\nPros+ The music is very atmospheric\n+ Every character gets a bit of background in their route\n+ A relatable, strong protagonist\n+ Its theme, style & feel of courtly intrigues\n+ 15 different endings, 4 romanceable princes\n\nCons- The two rival princes are not incorporated properly into the story if their path is not chosen\n- Not able to explicitly romance the ladies\n- The odd style discrepancy between the static character art/portraits and the big "event" art\n- Courtly intrigue is not that complicated\n\nIt's a solid visual novel/otome game that also focuses a lot on the protagonist's personal development and feelings, and allows you to make choices that lead to many different endings (though not all of them differ that much from each other). The plot or trap at the core of this plot is not that complicated or interesting in the end, and I found Madeleine's personal quest for a new life actually more engaging. The CGs or event art was very pretty, and I enjoyed that art style quite a lot more than the normal static character art.\n\nAlso! There are quite a few female characters in this game (Dolores, Princess Cassidy, and Colette), and you can become friends with all of them. Some art also includes Madeleine holding hands with them, building a life with them, etc., but it NEVER becomes explicit that you can actually romance them or be in a proper relationship with them. Like, what?? You give me all these cute girls (one of whom is explicitly into ladies), but I cannot make them happy in a romantic sense? :(\n\nAnyway, though this is not my favourite visual novel/otome, it is a very enjoyable one if you enjoy its theme! There's also much to be said for its female protagonist, Madeleine Valois, whose character is truly explored in the game.","May 2","true","6.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

And just like that I KNEW i had to play this game. After all, clever intrigues full of deception and pretense are my favorite kind of stories.\n\nI won't get into too much details on my general review to avoid spoiling it.\n\nGENERAL REVIEW\n\nYou're Madeleine Valois, second daughter of a cadet branch of an insignificant noble house. In the neighboring land of Gwellinor, a large and powerful kingdom, the heir, princess Cassidy, is expected to make her debut. And as young prince Oscar valet and closest advisor (a bond created since childhood), you accompany him in the hope that your young lord become the one who ends up winning her hand. But when princess Cassidy disappears and that the blame lays at the feet of young Oscar, things gets complicated. In a court where everyone has their own agendas, will you manage to circumvent the political landmines in hope of getting the upper hand in the end, or fail and suffer the consequences? And things get even more complicated when feelings begin to arise...\n\nGRAPHICS/MUSIC/INTERFACE\n\nMusic: The ambient music is absolutely perfect for this game, and I couldn't help but hum some of the songs while playing.\n\nGraphics: The quality of the graphics goes from average to good, with a lot efforts put on the CGS that are very nicely done, and this new version is even better!\n\nInterface: The interface is well-designed, with both a skip and a auto functions that are always appreciated, plenty of room to save, a jukebox if you want to listen to your favorite tunes from the games, and of course, the gallery containing all the CGS you obtained throughout the various gameplays.\n\nSTORY\n\nIt's impossible to tell more of the story than what I already told in the presentation without spoiling it, so instead I'll present to you the main characters and give you a glimpse at what you can expect.\n\nOscar: Ah, sweet and charming prince Oscar. The heroin herself describes him best: "his hair reflect his nature: sweet, rumpled, and unruly, a clumsy little boy in the body of a young man". Not falling in love with him might prove a challenge.\n\nNazagi: The cold prince of Asineth is as refined as he is feared, for being a Farmakeist (dabbling in the dark arts of potions). Ready to play a game of cat and mouse with him?\n\nCallum: The broody and angsty younger brother. Is there something behind his ruthless facade? And what is he after?\n\nGaston: Prince Gaston is quite a character. Don't let yourself distracted by his shining personality and do find out more about him. It's worth it.\n\nBut from the Queen and King of Gwellinor, to the suspicious Duke Pherod, and let's not forget the other servants, All oplay an important role in this story.\n\nThe heroin:\nYou quickly learn that Madeleine status is not only low but also that her future is quite uncertain. Her salvation came from serving at Prince Oscar's side and unsure him a successful future.\n\nBut how long will that last?\n\nThis is not a story where the commoner/lowly noble ends up with the prince just because it's the "power of love", because the heroin pure heart and good looks, combined to sheer luck, ends up winning everyone. Here, Madeleine is facing a difficult situation. After all, what are her options here? If she fails at her task, she will be disgraced. But then if she succeed and Oscar gets successfully married,her task will be done. And then what will become of her? Has she done enough to ensure her own future? Will it be at Oscar's side ?\n\nWhen she find herself dreaming of what she would have done if she were in a Cinderella story, interestingly enough, this is the conclusion she came to:\n\n" (...) Even in a magical gown, I am not a princess. Or perhaps I should take the gown and slippers and trade them in exchange for a better position, or sell them for coin. That's far more useful than a few fanciful moments in a ballroom. I don't need to find romance. I need a new center, a home, a piece of future that I can build and defend for myself".\n\nTo stray away from the path that had been chosen for her, she had to rely on her own strengths, and being sweet and caring weren't those :  she's resourceful and cunning, manipulative, driven and ambitious, but she's definitely not heartless, and while she's fighting for her own sake, more often than not it is to serve prince Oscar. She's loyal almost to a fault and she genuinely care about him. And she's probably the main reason for my love for this game. Finally someone different, who feels real and not some sweet lucky pumpkin!\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIf you haven't played it yet, you're missing out. The story is not only exciting as you see the plot unraveling but also quite emotional as the characters are more than pretty faces to romance. It also  promises to entertain you for many, many hours with 16 chapters as much as 15 different endings. I encourage you to try all the paths, as it's the only way to get a full understanding of the Hows and Whys. Sure, it could have been even better with some more depths for some parts of the plot and more gray choices, as some are really obvious but the game took some really unexpected turns and kudos for that!\n\nSpoilers ahead!!! Please don't read if you haven't done all the routes already.\n\n-\n\nSure you want to read?\n\n-\n\nOk then:\n\nOne thing that I loved about this game is that they stayed true to the characters and didn't betray them, or the story for the sake of an happy ending, as it happen so often (with a big deus ex machina coming from nowhere to explain why suddenly everything is ok, and the mc will get her fairy tale ending).\n\nOne example would be from my favorite route, Nazagi's route.  When he offered her to become his mistress and bear his children since Cassidy is unable to provide an heir, I was a bit stunned at first, but it made sense. Because that's who he is. He doesn't care that Cassidy is actually Caspian. In the contrary, it only means that he now has the leverage to make himself the best suitor for Cassidy. He wouldn't renounce his pretense on the throne for the MC. And if you went through the bad ending, you know that if at some point the MC gets or even might get in his way to become king, then he'll simply dispose of her and make sure she can't harm. And it made sense for Madeleine to accept it too. We're really far from a fairy tale here (and that's actually the happy ending ;), but any other ending featuring a romantic happy ending would have felt cheap.\n\nThat doesn't mean that there is only unromantic/sad endings. And this game has two more "typical" suitors with Callum and Oscar who both leads to fairytales like endings. And even Oscar's story, although done to death (the forbidden love trope with an happy ending), was still sweet and touching even if everything resolved itself a bit easily.\n\nAnother thing that deserve big kudos is that they took risks : i mean, I don't remember that many VNs with threesomes, or where the prince you pursue turns out to be bald, and you've got not shot at him since he only has eyes for the princess, who was born male. It was surprising, unexpected and thanks for that! We definitely need more variety, and the fact that every story doesn't end with a sweet romantic ending helps making the one that do mean something, something more than just an automatic "you win, here's the wedding scene" thing.","April 17, 2015","true","7.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Unless the game somehow borks itself in between Windows to Steam transition, I may not change much in this review.\n\nI initially came upon the game while looking for\nA. Female Protagonist\nB. Also female love interest\n\nUh... Criteria B is sort of met. If you are looking for developed female interest route, this title only has the tinies hint of shoujo ai and it is more of a side... distraction? Regarding the male love interests however and their routes, I'm usually (50%) pleasantly shocked and amazed in at the turn out. I definitely wasn't expecting how some of the endings unfolded. How very progressive. (This is a good thing) The fact that there's a strong female lead is a big plus too.\n\nThe visuals is very pleasing. The art style is a cut above the usual western VN I've come across. I'm very happy with the HD treatment they give to the Steam version. The pre-Steam version's background had been a bit jarring and didn't quite fit with the character portrait.\n\nIf I have to nitpick something, it's the way I get shuffled onto a male love interest route. Even though there were buildup flags before the selection, the "Push-Button-to-receive-GuyX" dispenser approach kind of bugs me. This is also a bit bizarre. During this dispenser scenario, whichever intentional bad end I might choose right now I seem to head straight into Callum's ending??? Not sure if this is a thing that happens from using older saves, current bug, or an intentional thing. It's intentional.\n\nOriginally posted by Hanako: For meta-reasons, that last choice right before the route-split is a mostly a fake choice (some of those options aren't even routes!) which is used as a tie-breaker. It does nothing unless you had the points to qualify for more than one route. If you did, and you pick one of those two routes, it'll adjust the values slightly to nudge you that direction.\n\nSo if you were hanging out with Callum all through the early game and ignoring all the other options, picking one of them at that last choice point will not change anything, you'll still be on Callum's route. But if you qualified early for Gaston's or Nazagi's routes, you can choose here to override getting Callum's route and go onto one of theirs instead.\n\nHope that makes sense!\nTo the folks who already owned the game before the Steam release, your old game saves CAN work with the HD version. Do expect some slight graphical hiccups caused by backgrounds due to the HD treatment. It's nothing game breaking yet. I may do some more testing later. Additional changes in the HD version includes better background art, higher resolution at 1440 x 900, typo/bug fixes, and some slight tweaks to someone's ending.

Has a tough exterior and skill+very knoweldable, assertive, and keen. Despite these "macho" qualities though, she does have a softer side that is quite charming.

At least then it would be within the same bloodline.\n- They make it seem like wearing glasses is an unattractive thing.

I replayed some of my favorite paths several times, in the same way I'd reread a short story I liked. The writing is rich and deep - which should be a given for VNs and so often is not. The Prince and Princess premise seems very cliché, but that's only on the surface; once you're past the prologue and the first four chapters, the story goes into highly surprising directions.\n\nPros:\n. Music is fantastic, and works very well with mood of scenes\n. Most (though not all) of the characters are well developed and nuanced; their strengths and flaws flow logically into their actions and reactions.\n. Well written story and interesting world. I particularly loved the concept of matriarchal inheritance the authors created. Land and wealth are inherited from mother to daugther only; sons get support and a title but no actual inheritance, and so are put in the position of having to win a bride in order to take any kind of place in society and help her manage her estate. Now, getting away from Ye Olde Feudal Europe setting is always appreciated, but this in particular put an interesting spin on story, world and character motivations.\n. The main character is fairly well rounded with both strength and weaknesses. Though I just wish she'd been allowed to kick butt and take names just a BIT more often...\n. The last path I took was Gaston's, because I didn't like what I'd seen of his character. And his story may not be for everyone, but damn, at the turning point, I actually had a small tear in my eye. It's...surpisingly effective.\n\nCons:\n. Throughout each path, you have maybe 20 choices all told, and only half of them matter. If that. Do NOT play this game because you like complicated every-choice-has-a-consequence game. Once you choose one of four paths, your impact on the game as the player, other than not getting your PC exiled or killed, is actually fairly minimal. THis bugged me at first, but then I decided to treat this like an actual visual novel rather than a real Choice Of type game.\n. THough the visual side is pretty limited, actually. THere's a few slides you can get in each path which are very pretty and sometimes quite touching, but most of the time you're looking at fairly bland scenery with sprites standing motionless and talking heads at the bottom. Standard fare for visual novels, true, but not the best part of this one by any means.\n. A few choices have pretty weird consequences. Just thinking about a guy is going to make him show up...? A good save/load, backtrack and auto-skip system allows you to fairly quickly undo anything you might regret in hindsight.\n","October 2, 2015","true","4.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

CGs are so pretty that i always had to stop playing for a moment just to adore them (the one in prince Nazagis route, man...); backgrounds and sprites are good too, although i wish sprites were done in the same art style that CG are..\nSome of characters i liked less, some more, some endings were kinda meh for me and some made me mentally clap for a while (prince Gastons happy end!!! i was so glad...), but the game as a whole was an enjoyable ride. Im feeling a bit of salt because of prince Nazagis happy ending, since he was my favourite, and not being the rightful wife is kind of disappointing, but i may eventually forgive it because prince Callum and prince Oscar had nice endings...  I like how you pretty much have to play all of the routes to unravel the whole truth.

Its her job to keep a watch out for him in everything the world throws at them. And her skills and wits are surely needed!\n\nPros;\nWell written story. Very in-depth. In order to get the full story, you will need to complete all the endings, wherever that be the good, neutral, or bad ending doesn't matter. You can choose to only complete one ending, but it will leave some questions unanswered. It's worth doing them all tho.\nAs mention above there are multiple endings. Going one ending is far off the other endings that you might feel like you are reading another VN but within the same universe. With the exception of one that requires you to take the path of one ending in order to unlock the other ending later in the story for you to choose. There are good, neutral, and bad endings.\nChoices matter and there are a decent amount of them.\nArtwork is cute.\nInteresting Romances. Only 2 characters can be what we normally call romanced with, the others still have some romance to it, but of a different kind. No intercourse or nudity in any of the routes.\nCons;\nI would have liked to have seen a little more romance since there isn't really much of it, just a kiss or two.\nThere were a text or two that the game wouldn't skip, even tho the texts were the same. I suspect this was because the texts was displayed in a new route/ending you had not previously taken. So therefor it thought it was different. Not really a big deal, can just be annoying if you want to complete all the endings/routes and then have to manually skip it while making sure not to skip over text you have not seen yet.\nOverall The Royal Trap: The Confines Of The Crown, is a must for a VN fan. It surely is worth the price, tho there is nothing wrong in waiting for it to get on sale.\n\nHowever, I like to note that this VN doesn't have much romance and no combat in it, so if that is what you are looking for then you won't find it here, but its still worth the read and what little romance it does have.","January 31","true","9.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The theme song is just AWESOME!\n\nI really liked this game, the protagonist is tough and far from the typical 'sweet girl' act. That's not to say there aren't issues, however.\n\nPros:\n- Maddie is the 'protector' not the damsel.\n- the system of who inherits the throne and who rules is more even between the sexes, it's actually a really interesting take on the whole thing.\n- the bachelors are different and it's not just 'pick hot guy X' there are some twists and turns and your own happy end is not always the best result.\n- the characters are well-rounded and you get to become interested in them.\n- the happy end for a particular character is not necessarily the way you'd expected.\n- tons of replay value.\n- the intro song is SO awesome, I downloaded it!\n\nCons:\n-  being force-fed the whole 'Oscar loves you'-bit, it's cliché, annoying and frankly just seems like a big, fat 'boys and girls can never just be friends' sign beating you over the head, repeatedly.\n- Maddie cannot get out of the mess she ends up in, herself, which I kinda wish was possible. However, I realize that had Maddie been a guy then it might not have been an issue, so I'm a little torn on that front.\n- the devs are trying WAY to hard to make some characters likable, despite being just generally awful characters who never get what's coming to them. (The king and queen comes to mind.]\n\nI recommend this game to VN fans who like castle settings, intrigue, princes and princesses and a heroine who can handle herself.","March 20","true","15.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Still, it was very shallow, no matter if Valois married Oscar or not. The story was incomplete and felt so. As such I decided on a second playthrough following Prince Callium's (I hope I got his name right) route and I was surprised by finding out the true reason behind the game's name was exactly what I suspect it to be!

The plot is not predictable like many other visual novels, and keeps you on edge every time. I love it that the endings are unconventional as well, and there are really 6 characters you can fall "in love" with :)","March 8","true","12.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You don't feel like you are playing an uninteresting character. The story line is rich and plots can be endearing.\n\nI was pretty satisfied with my game endings, even when I had a bad ending! Most enjoyable and definitely worth the full price, considering the details of it and the beautiful artwork and feel of the storyline.\n\nThis game is pretty inspiring and I hope to see more VNs like it. I am glad I invested at full price for this game to support the creator of it, because it seems like the games I've played and made by this developer has good thoughts and heart put into it.","January 21","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

All the characters are fun (and, uh, very easy to get attached to), the protagonist actually has a solid, interesting personality (PRAISE THE LORD), the writing is truly outstanding, and there are plenty of twists to keep you hooked (even if some of the plot doesn't always shy away from cliche).\n\nI cannot recommend this VN highly enough. If you're a fan of the genre at all, do yourself a favour and get into this.","March 31","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sounds trite but you're more spymaster than matchmaker and there's all sorts of plotting going on.\n\nThe branching paths of this story are all drastically different. I wanted to play through all the routes to fully understand everything that was going on rather than ending/achievement hunting. The writing and plotting is really good.\n\nSadly there are no endings where you can pair up your prince with another prince. There should be.","May 24","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
