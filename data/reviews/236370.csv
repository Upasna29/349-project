Dynamic maps!

(keyword: yet)Client-server feedback latency may vary for different people.\nIf your opponent/robot manage to shoot you in the head before you can even react, blame lag.    Small multiplayer population + surplus servers + high ping (in my area)Perfectly good money wasted on empty servers, IMO.    No landsharks, yet.Devs are so perfectionist that they want to perfect the AI code before introducing the sharks... *hype dies out*    Spoiler: Not in space, yet. (The NeuroGen Incident is a reenactment underground.)\n\nThus, in the current state of this game:\n\nRecommended For:\nGamers looking for a highly balanced and tactical FPS.\nGamers looking for thrills with replay value, and tired of mediocre jumpscares.\n(Advice: Never play on Easy mode. It kills the atmosphere.)\nBut this is not meant to be a horror game. It's... uhm... a test!\nLive by the game tagline: In space, your friends can hear you scream.\nNot Recommended For:\nGamers used to and prefer mainstream FPS, like CS, CoD, BF etc.\nPeople who don't like buggy and incomplete indie games.\nGamers who set the same high expectations like they do with heavily funded games by big publishers....which I can totally understand.

The IDEA of Interstellar Marines began in 2005, not the actual development.\n\n2. They launched a failed kickstarter in 2009 and recieved NO money as a result.\n\n3. That was AFTER they filed for bankruptcy due to the economic slump at the time.\n\n4. This game has been in early access since 2013, not longer, as others have said.\n\n5. The reason for the slow progress (so far) is that they literally have a handful of people working on the game, and they have so little money that they are basically working on this game for free.\n\n6. The devs are NOT abusive. If anything, they break their backs to ensure the satisfaction of their consumers.\n\nSo, if you like what you see, buy it. It'll only get better from there, and it has a dedicated community. If you're holding off because it's in Early Access, at least keep an eye on it.\n\nThey don't say "For the love of the game" because it sounds nice.

After getting my hopes up for a game that in my opinion had a vast amount of potential, there just hasn't been enough progress to make me believe in to the game anymore.

Another GRAND update!!! This time the changes include ultra realistic, highly tactical, extremely accurate, high quality, high fiedlity, high definition, revolutionary, ground braking, one of a kind FALLING DAMAGE! Also this update includes.... NOTHING ELSE!\nSO HAVE FUN DEAR PLAYERS, AND THANK YOU FOR LETTING US RIP YOU OFF!\n\nEarlier reviews below.\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nSo, more than a month has passed since I originally reviewed IM. A new update is out, so, I installed the game to check out if there has been any progress. (The description of the update states, that this time, the only changes are a switch to Unity 5, and some crappy map was re-added to coop, probably for the 647th time, so I didn't hold my breath...) I quickly went through NGI to assess the situation. Sadly, there is nothing good to report.\n\nNo visible progress at all. One thing that did catch my attention though, was that 30 seconds after I started the level, I fell through the floor for no apperant reason... Great start (But, what else is new, right?). I restarted the level, and played a bit more. It was the first time I played this game in six months.\nI will now list the changes I've noticed: The voice and lines of the computer in NGI changed a bit, my guns and suit changed collor, there is a small fatigue percentage in the bottom right of the screen and a "Hell week" button has been added to the main menu. That's it. These are the changes made to the game during six months of development... Can't wait to try the game in another six months, and find that the fatigue percentage moved to the top left of the screen, and that two maps that were removed from coop in the last update, were returned (As usual...).\n\nThe part I liked the most about this, is in the description of the update: "The next step we want to do is improve performance even more with Speedtree and boost the graphics even more with physically based shaders, global illumination, linear lighting and deferred rendering 2.0."\nYAY! The next update will be as useless as this one!\n\nThe original review is below.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\nI like this game, I really do. Why won't I recommend it then? Let me explain.\nCurrently, the game is in decent shape, with nice gameplay, nice graphics, a reasonable amount of content for the price. The problem is, the developers say it will have so much more. The "vision" of IM is quite grand, and it would be great if it actually happened. I just doubt it will happen...\n\nI mean, the progress is waaay too slow. Updates are few and far between (once every two-three monts), and when an update does comes out, new features are almost non-existant. Even many of the bug fixes that are stated as fixed on the changelog, are actually not fixed. It's like "This update, we are going to release the sprinting and fatigue system! In three months we will fix the broken sprinting and fatigue system! Three months after that, we will impliment our super advanced crouching system! AND, don't forget that after six more months we will add a flash light! Our game is uber-tactical with ultra advanced and realistic (unimplimented) skin system! Land sharks are just around the corner (and have been for the last year or so)! And of course, stay tuned, because we are going to take this game (advertised as a mainly SP/COOP game) and add a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ MP survival mode that no one wants, instead of focusing on the campaign or on adding more guns!"\n\nThey advertise their crouching and sprinting systems as "realistic", "advanced" and "revolutionary", and yet I do not see how they are different from any other FPS... And this is what gets to me. This dishonesty on the part of the developers.\nIf they would advertise the game as it is, and not throw in things they will get around to in about ten years, I would recommend it. It is pretty enjoyable as it is. But seeing as the developers are dishonest, and insist on misleading the players, I will not recommend this game!","June 12, 2015","false","35.5"," 347 of 432 people (80%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","80","347","432","16","46"

My mind filled with visions of shark-creatures, tactical combat, and more sharks...\n\nUnfortunately, that game I saw a few years before is still in early access stages.\n\nHowever, that’s not bad. On the contrary, it’s a good thing, considering all the troubles Zero Point Software has faced even trying to get it to this point. The stuff they’ve been through so far is already an inspiring tale by itself.\n\nNote that the following is subject to change and modification as updates roll out and as I improve what I have to say. If you don’t like my review, please, give me some feedback in the comments!\n\n\nThe review-\nAs of writing, the current update (Update 16) features quite a few things, but is missing many more. The game is still rather barebones due to all the indev and inactive features, the guns still possessing infinite ammo and marines still missing some vital things.\n\nHOWEVER, even at this pre-alpha stage, Interstellar Marines is a blast.\n\nTense Player versus Player matches, while not the focus of the game, drip with a fragile surface tension that can be broken violently with gunfire as you try to take points or navigate the map, the immersion being damn great.\nThe low health, movement style, and unforgiving weaponry contribute to this tense and (semi) tactical gameplay, and will hopefully continue to get better and better as updates are rolled out, and features are added, increasing the number of strategies and tactical moves a team can use to wipe out the opposition, be they Human Players...\n\nOr Combat Training Robots, built to push you to your limit in tense PvE missions, all designed with co-op in mind. Update 13 brought everyone access to fight CTRs proper in the 'Neurogen Incident', the first 'Campaign' mission of IM that has a tense (if glitchy) atmosphere, achieved by setting players in a replica space station and giving them multiple objectives to achieve their way.\nSince then, more and more AI missions have been added, with Terrorist-Hunt style elimination missions, or Update 16's new 'Assault on Starcrown Aerospace'.\n\nIn terms of the effort and care put into the game, there is a distinct lack of major bugs and issues most of the time, and even then Zero Point Software always listens to the community. The quality of the game is high, especially for early access and Unity Engine, and with a shared vision they've gone far, and seem to be going further. You could mistake their work for a veteran developer’s. Triple-A indie indeed!\n\nUnfortunately, at times it’s a bit challenging to be tactical and immersed like ZPS wants. At the moment there’s no proper teamchat, and a limited number of gamemodes and players (Get on more, damn you).\n\nAs for how it runs and looks, this game isn't for low end PCs. Before I upgraded I often had 15 FPS on average. Despite this, the views are spectacular, and the graphics actually play an important part in gameplay, due to the dynamic lighting system, the fog and the storm effects. A map can be pushed into pitch-black due to the said lighting, a player can shoot out lights, you can be spotted using the light, etcetera. Loads of options opened by graphics.\n\nAs for the online community, with the exception of teamkillers and some new players, those I’ve seen are mature and understand the game, and despite a somewhat lower population of players, there's still dedicated people playing. Very rarely have I seen someone call anyone a 'hacking noob' or anyone go on generic 'CoD-child rage'.\n\nAs for the major story and all that, we’ll just have to wait for the future, and the Carcharodons/landsharks. Glorious landsharks!\nAs for ZPS, you guys are dedicated, and the stuff you’re doing to connect with the community is great. Can’t wait for the future!\n\n\ntl;dr, Even though it’s barebones, it's something to follow, and it plays hard.\n\n\nNow, as for buying it, I'd personally recommend it to support the devs (I know they need it, for the love of the game!) and purchase it, but if you're not that into early access or 'barebones' gameplay, then you may want to wait a bit.\nThe price will go up, though, over time.\n\nNOTE,\nBefore you make any decisions, you should go see some gameplay of the current version.\n\n\nAdditions:\n\nCONCERNING THE LACK OF LANDSHARKS AND CAMPAIGN:\nThis is a bloody early access, and it takes time to recreate those things in Unity. Be patient, there's less than 20 devs, and they first want a solid multiplayer first for you, the player or potential believer! And then, only then, can they begin to focus on the landsharky goodness.\n\nWhere is the ‘First Immersion’ demo?!\nIt was a small publisher demo created to get them publishers back in 2007-8, demonstrating features on Unreal Engine 3. Unfortunately they can’t release it or work on it due to licensing red tape. However, Xeno-13 will be remade eventually!\n\nMy feelings on the progress of the game after so long:\nThey've gone through some stuff, and they hit steam with only two developers. Now, today, they're becoming able to hire more due to steam's early access, which will allow them to slowly speed up development and finally get the game out the gate.\nAfter seeing what some of the Devs had to say, I’ve also learned that the ‘lack of progress’ some people argue is actually lots of unseen progress, and lots of bugfixing going on. You don’t see the badass ninja from that one VLog anywhere in the game because they actually fixed that BEFORE updating the game!\n\nMore/Outdated responses\nI see how some complain that the game did not deliver, lied in it's advertising and all that. I say that when you look at the big picture, with all of ZPS' troubles, experiences, and traits, that the advertising was in no way false at the time it was made.\nOriginal trailer, made to impress and to get a publisher, but from what I remember they didn’t say it was really ingame.\nSpace Station and Sharks gameplay, a demo built on the Unreal 3 engine to impress and get a publisher, before 2008 screwed them over.\nWhy does the current game look and play so differently than the demo? They can't use the Unreal 3 engine, the license costs a million bucks. That and the assets are a bit dated, and more legal tape.\n\nThere's more, but I believe this illustrates my point.","February 27, 2014","true","59.6"," 287 of 371 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","287","371","0","18"

I've supported the development by purchasing the spearhead version of the game before it was on steam and afterwards I bought it again on steam to support further. I've purchased several bagdes of support from their website and even bought some of the company shares that were on sale a few years ago. I've seen this game go through many different development stages. The game simply is not what it had been advertised as back in 2006, or maybe it was 2005. I am not sure but at any rate I do not expect it to deliver anymore.\n\nThere are people who are happy with the current state of the game and I'm glad it gets support. However, as someone who has been waiting for this game since it was first announced I believe there are some things that have not been delivered. I do not expect a game that has been in develoment for this long to be the same game that it was announced as and frankly from what I've played so far that expectation might be correct.\n\nI do not recommend this game to anyone, and before you decide to buy it I would like you to be aware that this game has been in develoment almost as long as Duke Nukem Forever and that you should look into it more before you decide that you truly want it.","June 15, 2015","false","2.3"," 218 of 276 people (79%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","79","218","276","7","7"

With more sodium.\n\nWhen I first picked up Interstellar Marines, I was hooked instantly. I thought that there was no limit, and the devs fueled that feeling with vlogs showing things to be genuinely stoked for. The idea felt fresh in a genre where literally every avenue has been explored -- be it by big game industries or indie developers -- and that nothing came as a surprise. I waited for that polish to the game, and even ended up buying 5 other copies for friends to play with me and help the game grow.\n\n"So why did you stop, why are you giving this game a bad review?"\n\nBecause these devs are slower than the skeleton crew updating DayZ Standalone.\n\nThree years in Steam EA -- with plenty more behind that -- and what do they have to show for it? A few 'missions' and tweaks that should be done after you put in content needed to call this a game. I've seen game demos more complete than this.\n\nI'm not sure if it's program regulations or your character just enjoys it, but you walk around like you have a giant metal rod up your ♥♥♥. It's clearly not beyond the dev team's capabilities to make a working movement animation or make the characters look convincing, just look at the robots running around.\n\nSpeaking of robots, aside from the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t multiplayer system they have in the game (try getting into a Hell Week lobby), did you know that they are the ONLY enemies you have in the entire game? After the initial fear of the unknown wears off, be prepared to delve into the dark with these bots either shooting at you or flailing their arms out you with some scream along the lines of "HOOOOUURRRRGH".\n\nThree years of development, and they haven't been able to ship out a single mission past 'training simulations' for the real threats in space. I know a handful of people that -- given three years only -- would be AGES ahead of what this team has brought us in updates that provide no real useful content at all. We got a PVP/E game mode now. Whooptee ♥♥♥♥ing doo.\n\nMaybe that was their message behind this game. That there was no alien threat and therefore we all look dumb, waiting to encounter alien lifeforms, weapons in hand. That's what I'm going to hope, because other than an overprice, sick, twisted prank, this game only stands as a pillar in reasons I don't EVER want to put money towards another game with an EA tag on it again.\n\nThanks devs for betraying our trust, breaking promises and dreams, and adding into the phobia of investing into an EA that becomes a waste of cash.","April 24","false","16.3"," 147 of 181 people (81%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","81","147","181","18","5"

I played Amesia without flinching. I sat through Five Nights at Freddies and only jumped once.\n\nBut this game regularly makes me actually scream, and flinch badly enough I can't aim properly. I can't place exactly what does it, or why it does it so well, but holy ♥♥♥♥ does it ever. The noises the bots make, the way they lunge for you, the absolutely jawdropping immersion. This game isn't billed as a horror, and in reality, it shouldn't be. You play a fully armored, trained Marine, with unlimited ammo, flashlights, lasers, and the most advanced weapons in the entire armed forces. It couldn't be a survival horror, or even really a horror at this rate.\n\nWhat it is is a very tense, tight, amazing shooter. Controls are absolutely tight (With the exception of stairwalking) weapons feel good, the lighting is top notch, and the sound is literally eargasmic. Everything combines to make a game that takes a badass fighter, and makes them seem like a very human fighter. The Marines say nothing, but you feel like you're actually there, fighting in their boots, sweating around the grips of their weapons. It's barely alpha even now, with many features missing and planned, and many bugs and issues.\n\nAnd yet, it's still the best first person shooter I've played. It may not be the funnest, nor the fastest, nor even the most well polished. But it's a true first person experience, injecting you into the game in a way that I've wished for in many others.","January 6, 2015","true","27.3"," 107 of 125 people (86%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","86","107","125","13","2"

But as it seems like right now the devs will continue this game. The first impression of this game when i first saw the video that plays when you first start up the game was great. the game has great overall graphics and suits pretty much all computers (within limitations) you do not need to have an super computer to play this game and it gives good fps.\nIn the begining you will start straight on the training course to get used to the controls.\nthen you are on your'e own. you can choose to play either single player (story mode/campaign) or you can jump over to co-op or versus mode. but first off im gonna talk about single player:\n\nSingle player means that you play versus the computer, (also called bots/Ai's)\nThe bots in this game are well made, they seem to be "artificial intelligent" they detect you easier when you stand/run than they do when you crouch and move slowly.\nIn game you will also have the options to equip lights (F), laser aim on your gun (G) or supressor (Q) when you use laser and the flashlight in game be carefull,\ because other players in game can see the laser and the flashlight (bots too)\nthey detect you a lot more faster when you have laser and flashlight enabled.\nIf you do not use the sound supressor on your gun, then be adviced. within a few seconds you will hear tons of robots stomping in the ground and coming sprinting towards you and ready to bash your skull in with their fists :)\n\nthe envoirment in the game is mostly dark/foggy so it is hard to spot enemies as well as it is hard to stay hidden if you will have to use your flashlight. this is why i often like strobing the flashlight for few moments as it can be mistaken to be lights in game that flimmers.\n\nThe thing with this game is that there are not very many guns. wich makes this game more focused on how actually skilled you are isntead of all the gear.\nsome peopels like it. some peoples dont.\n\nthe physics in the game are great. movement are well balanced as well as the gravity, in this game you do not have a bar that shows your stamina. but you still have it. so dont be sprinting around like a maniac. because this will affect how well you can aim when youre standing still as you will soon start to breathe like you have held your breath for 5 mina haha.\n\nin game you can comunicate with different players. both with text and with voice chat. voice (V) chat is more prefered as the text does not show up before you open the "text menu" where you writes your messages, so they do not pop up on your screen automatically.\n\nIf you like to change graphics settings or general game settings and key bindings, then there is an fair ammount of options to use. and the game has a good compability to most screens. wich is quite good as i am using an 50" tv while i play. wich can be troubling in many games.\n\nAlso, every single bullet you fire in this game counts. the STATS menu will show you absolutely everything, and by saying this i mean absolutely EVERYTHING\nyou can see how many bullets you have shot, how many kills, how many deaths, kill/death ratio, wich body part you have hit the most. and how many times you have hit the different body parts counted per bullet.\n\nso theres lot of room for competition with your friends about the best stats.\nit is also displaying what your favourite weapon is.\n\nThe in game controls are easy to maneuver and is easy to get used to.\nIf you want to play online either in co-op or in versus battles there are plenty of servers in different locations so you can use the filters to browse for servers that is filling your recuirements of ping, difficulty, game mode and so on.\n\nIf you have any questions or any issues or maby even a bug report then you can just contact the devs via twitter, facebook or the steam game forum page, they are really fast at responding. and they are also really friendly.\n\ni have already reported in a few bugs that aint a big deal and they responded within 20 minutes.\nGG DEVS AND KEEP IT UP!\nso i give the support area an 10/10 points just for that.\n\nOne of the biggest thigns about this game is that even it is a futuristic/sci-fi game it is still really realistic wich means things work out in the game as it would in real life, as an example: laser aim. in many games they make the laser beams a solid red beam that is highly visiblie to all players. but i real life you would not be able to see the laser beam unless theres some dust particles in the air. the more dust particles in the air, the more visiblie the beam gets.\n\nand in the game. it is just slightly visiblie as it is under normal circumstances in real life.\n\nthe flashlight is dynamic light. it fades over distance and lights up the room like a real flashlight. it is not a static/flat light.\n\nBEAUTIFUL!\n\nwhen you run, your character starts breathing more heavily. and starts to run slower.\nif you get injured. your vision will become blurry and you will have an hard time to see your surroundings until you recover.\n\nin the interview of the devs they say they wanted to create this game as realistic as possiblie for sci-fi games. and they did it pretty well!\n\nin general this game is a whole lot of fun and really exciting and it is a great game and personally i have high expectations for this game as it got such big potentional to become something big and if you like fps games. then this is the game for you.\n\nin general i give this game an 8/10 points.\nreason i do not give it 10/10 is because of there is a few bugs, but im pretty sure this will be fixed pretty soon.\nthe campaign does not have much of an "story" but this is just what i like with games.\nthe multiplayer part is 10/10\nbut as i said earlier. this is still an early access game. so it is not done yet and it will improove over time. it is a good buy and i do recommend this game.\n\nthis is one of the best FPS multiplayer games made in a really long time.\n\nLock'n load. and prepare for having some real fun !\n\n(i have  made an in game video wich i will post up here pretty soon)\nand ps: excuse my english grammar, im not from an english speaking country ;)\n\n\n\nheres my video reviev in game:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9KGaymIquU&feature=youtu.be","February 10, 2015","true","5.6"," 223 of 304 people (73%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review

I am eager to finally play the finished version no matter if it is still some time away. This game has taken me through a variety of emotions from fear, frustration, elation, and more. All of these things make it fun and challenging. It takes some time to get used to, because of some of the pre alpha anomalies.  It is like a new pair of shoes. They look good, but when you try them on, they don't fit at first. After wearing them for a while they feel great and become your favorite.\n\nSome people have problems getting used to the game, or have issues getting it running on their hardware. Just stepping over to the community with these problems and you will find a very enthusiastic and supportive dev group and player base that offer up loads of support to get you through the rough patch.\n\nThis game has the makings of a great single player horror FPS, and a great multiplayer competitive shooter. Add in the ability to do multiplayer co-op, and it becomes an epic game. It has a fine balance between frantic shooter and tactical shooter. As I see the story plans unfold, I suspect I will be enveloped by an epic single player story when it is finished.\n\nAs long as this game stays on the current heading, it will become a classic that everyone will remember. I have so much fun with this game that I bought it for all my closest gaming buddies.\n\nIf you buy it based on this review, I only hope that you enjoy it as much as I do, or meet me on the server and let me help you work those new shoes in until they are comfortable.","December 4, 2014","true","235.9"," 73 of 85 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","73","85","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/archer01/recommended/236370/","archer01","Eric aka Julian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/archer01/","51 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game is agressivley fair. The balance of the maps is remarkable, and the perioding changes in lighting and atmosphere really help to shake up the playing field and ensure that a team doesn't win simply by virtue of being "on a roll". Everyone uses the same gun, and that gun has a red-dot sight, laser pointer, and flashlight. The gun is satisfying to use and kills with relative ease. From the very beginning, I felt like I had a fair chance against anyone, and not once have I ever experienced the all-to-faimilar rage feeling of being killed in what feels like an "unfair" way, be it camping, quick-scoping, or improbable longshots.\n\nThat being said, the game feels very slow. Movement is slower than you would expect, and my character feels sluggish overall. The feeling of awkwardness disspiates quickly, but is there nonetheless.\n\nThe graphics are nothing stellar, but they are certainly pleasant and adequate. The blackness of night and the glow of the lights are beatiful, but the snow feels very cheaply done and could use some improvement. The gun is a fairly generic SMG/Assault Rifle hybrid. Player models can open their helmets but still look like generic SWAT Team members.\n\nIn conclusion, the game is fun and enjoyable. Well worth $15 (or $7.50 from the Humble Store). Expect to get at least a few fun hours out of it, and hopefully a lot more as the game develops and gets more content.\n\nPS- Playing at night is probably the best experience in the game. There is a finesse to the strategy of when to use/not use your flashlight, and it feels appropriatley tense and exciting. Many ninja opportunities are present.\n\nPPS- You cannot jump or crouch, which is sort of odd, but not particularly annoying, at least for me.","November 25, 2013","true","8.8"," 228 of 323 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","228","323","0","2"

Sure, you could say "Well of course the product is lacking - it's early alpha!" but there comes a point where that ship sails and you're stuck with dreams and promises.\n\nMaybe they are still working on the bigger picture - the 'game' they pitched to me when I payed for my early access copy. Who knows? At the rate that updates are pushed out, that light at the end of the tunnel seems to never get any closer.\n\nThe game in its current state is good. Just good; Your time in I.M. will consist of tension-filled SWAT style room searching and clearing, fighting robots in dark rooms and eerie spaces. The tension I.M. creates in these moments is fantastic. On more than one occasion I found myself frozen with panic, even when playing with friends in co-op, desperately trying to listen out for the direction at which a hissing robot would approach.\n\nThis gets old quickly however when you've played the same mission twice or more, encountering the same dull colours I.M. seems to have in abundance. Everything looks like it's... placeholder, to be blunt; perhaps the drab, grey scenery is an artistic style choice made by the developers, and perhaps it does not appeal to my particular taste - my point is, everything looks strangely bland, as if rushed and put together as placeholder textures. Being early access, I would expect this to be standard practice for a game's aesthetics in its early stages, but when does it end? When will this be worked on? Take away the lighting and everything's just.... flat grey. It's strange that this is the case after all this time of development (some say two years).\n\nRobots are your sworn enemy in this game. Do not be mislead; there are no aliens or 'land sharks' to shoot in I.M. in its current state. The entirety of this early access game has been constructed as a 'training' simulation for when you take on the real threat. This sounds great, but.... must we really put up with 'training' for years upon years until actual meaningful gameplay comes our way? Where is this alien threat the developers speak of? When do we get to experience their beautiful vision for a game, huh? It's not there, do not expect it to be included should you buy I.M. early access.\n\nThe hours that I've put into this game are not impressive. Certainly not. Despite this I feel as if I've begun to stretch my enjoyment out of this game to its breaking point (actually, I might never get the chance, as I'll tell you); No one's playing this game any more. I bought I.M. for the promise of excellent co-op gameplay - it did not disapoint, at least for my first few play throughs. Sadly, servers are now empty. This alone should be reason enough to not invest your money. Too much time has passed and not enough has happened to retain the community's interest in playing I.M..\n\nI love the concept of this early access game. Usually that should be enough to get me to give a thumbs-up for early access, but I can't, not in this case. I honestly feel like you'll be wasting your money. I.M. is moving so very slowly that I'm sure it's just not a priority for the developers any more, and will never be finished, even to a barely acceptable level.\n\nThe most recent update is titled.... "Update 21: Falling Damage". This just about sums it up. Is this even noteworthy? In the update notes, yes, but it speaks volumes of just how slowly this game is moving.\n\nMy faith in Interstellar Marines is wavering. I cannot recommend this early access game. I'm disapointed. This concept for a game is great - but that's all it still is, mostly just a concept, a promise yet to be fulfilled.\n\n","September 24, 2015","false","17.5"," 102 of 133 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","102","133","0","0"

If you discount that, there's been few reasons for players to re-visit the game for more than a mission/match or two before leaving again, as content additions are so incredibly tiny. Yeah, sure, implementing systems like stamina and falling damage are important for a game, but after two long years of additions like this, there's still a bland and simple core gameplay across all game modes. No new weapons, enemies or gear that changes gameplay itself. Just more slow cautious gameplay with two and a half weapons.\n\nPlayers both old and new have expressed their concerns to the devs on what they're prioritising work on, only to be brushed aside pretty quickly by typical PR talk and the fanboys that agree with it. "We need to lay all the groundwork before we can invest in other content," is the popular go-to for anyone bringing their priorities into question. But after two years of just groundwork, they're still refusing to add tangible content like weapons to keep players actually interested. And with a lack of interest, the servers are empty. Dead. Maybe 10 people online globally if you're lucky, 50 on an update day. But they don't seem to care, because despite this they're still pushing development on 'Hell Week', a mode designed for 30+ players in a battle royale, which is barely ever populated.\n\nAnd the paying, supporting players who are still here are probably wondering, "what has all our money gone towards?" because the devs are at the point of taking on volunteer staff. Yes, they lack animators and modellers... And if they supposedly do have some as volunteers, then they certainly aren't using them.\n\nDon't board a sinking ship. Go play Insurgency and imagine it's sci-fi, then you'll already be playing what this game is aspiring to be.\n\nSomeone comment on this in three years so I can come back and see if they've added new tangible content, or if they just kept tweaking the tiniest details and systems that should be icing on the cake later.","November 18, 2015","false","98.1"," 72 of 88 people (82%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","82","72","88","5","0"

The playerbase would increase with more singleplayer/co-op gameplay centered updates.\n\nNonetheless, I would highly recommend this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bipolar_bear/recommended/236370/","bipolar_bear","Bipolar Bear","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bipolar_bear/","71 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAfter 8 hours of trying to enjoy this game I pretty much found myself at wit's end.\n\nDevelopment is dragging on forever and there has been little in the way of note-worthy updates.\n\n\nGood\nMy favorite part of the game (and this is honestly kind of sad) is that you can open and close your helmet visor.  So far it's pointless, but during the more lengthy game modes I find that opening the visor makes the game feel much more immersive - and it also makes me feel like kind of a bad-♥♥♥ for some reason.\n\nI also really like the tap/hold functionality for running, flashlight, etc.  You can tap to toggle on/off or just hold it for the duration you want it on.  It's a nice touch that I haven't seen before anywhere else.\n\nDynamic maps like Elevation show promise, in that the environment changes - on this map in particular areas of the playing field raise and lower.  That was very cool and is a gimmick that the dev's should definitely try to cash in on.\n\nThe 2 guns look nice. (Note: they've added a pistol, wow, 3 weapons now!)\n\n\nNeutral\nI started with coop, playing each of the Survival and Elimination maps and the much praised Neurogen Incident map where we experienced the key-card bug and ended up wandering around for 40 minutes (our collective confusion was the most amusing thing I experienced in the game).  I enjoyed myself but it didn't take long before I lost interest.\n\nThe next night I tried single player looking for something more immersive, and although it was a bit creepier to not have backup I just found myself running from objective to objective running and gunning without much strategy at all (yes, even on the Neurogen Incident map).\n\nFinally I tried the multiplayer, after about 10 attempts to join servers and 10 subsequent errors I finally got to play.  I quickly found that 3-4 sloppy shots across a moving enemies torso was enough to get a kill.  My fondest memory was getting repeatedly team-killed and having to wait 2 minutes for re-spawn.  Also, I was killed a number of times without hearing any bullets, seeing any enemies or noticing any incoming damage beforehand or even seeing a message about who or what killed me.\n\nThe alerts that appear if you accidentally shoot a teammate are a nice touch but since you get kills in 1-4 shots it's always too late to be useful anyway.  The only thing that really differentiates enemies from teammates (when your visor is open or HUD is down) are some barely noticeable blue lights on their uniforms.  Some claim this is to add to the realism (right, because a game where robots run at you at 150mph is realistic), but I tend to think the dev's have just been too lazy to make a slightly different marine skin.\n\nNormally, I play games for a couple to a few hours at a time but I just had no desire to do so with this one as it quickly became redundant, regardless of the solo/coop/multi options and different game types that aren't really too dramatically different from one another.\n\n\nBad\nWhat we have right now is a game with only 3 weapons, 2 enemy types and a handful of playable maps.  Reading through the development blog I see that it took almost a year for crouching to be implemented - this, among many other things, in my opinion does not bode well for the future of the game.  People have provided me with reasons (excuses) as to why it took so long, claiming that it's more advanced than a typical crouch function, but they fail to realize that what it is is actually just a cover system, and I've played tons of games with cover systems, it's nothing new and I'm not impressed.\n\nFrom a distance, the game looks visually pleasing, but if you actually stop to look at anything you find that it's all really quite bland and lacking in detail.  The computer consoles, for example, have less detail than an unpainted plastic model kit.  I wonder if that's one of the reasons they made everything so dark?  The environments just feel lifeless, stale and uninteresting.\n\nWhen you start the game you're thrown into possibly one of the most boring training missions ever without even really telling you who you are, what's going on, why you're doing the things you do, etc.\n\nThe AI is atrocious, but stupidly entertaining.   I have approached groups of bots, shot one and the rest just stand there and watch.  I've seen 3-4 bots getting stuck going up a flight of stairs.  I've had staring contests with a few bots that I'm pretty sure are supposed to be trying to murder me.  Sometimes they move around a corner to try and hide from you, but they only go halfway behind the wall so it's still easy to shoot them in the side of the face anyway.  They also tend to get stuck on walls and behind doors.  The only thing that balances their stupidity is the fact that they can usually kill you in 1-2 shots which makes me wonder why the marines even bother wearing body armor.\n\nThere are a number of silly animations and sounds which I'm sure could be improved rather easily.  The running animation is as comical as can be and there seems to be an issue currently causing marines to suffer from rather serious sounding asthma attacks.  I find it funny how you can kill someone who is standing perfectly still and their weapon goes flying like there is a really powerful wind or something (if you don't believe me, go to the physics playground, shoot the marine statues and watch the guns fly).\n\nI see a lot of people saying this game is scary, granted the maps are generally pretty dark and robots run at you ridiculously fast causing some jump scares.  It is creepy to hear their footsteps in the distance and wonder what direction they'll come from.  I would still consider Mass Effect to have scarier moments and that was not a scary game.\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\nAt the end of the day I wouldn't have high hopes for this game, it has taken the developers a very long time to come as far as they have and they have much much farther to go if they want to achieve the "AAA indie" game they keep talking about.  In my experience, a game that takes forever to develop is most likely a game that will never deliver on the promises it has made, or it will be ripped off and done better and faster by somebody else.","February 13, 2015","false","8.1"," 221 of 321 people (69%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","69","221","321","19","26"

It seems their new goal is too make a multiplayer shooter which is a huge letdown after their previous trailers and early announcments.\n\nRight now the game has very little content to offer. A handful of multiplayer maps, two weapon models and one enemy model. Even the frequent update schedule is not helping because the updates have little to no new content added. All they do is tweak some minor things like the colour of text in the main menu or the player's movement speed. Honestly this is something you'd see in a small patch after the game is released.\n\nThe game feels empty, flat and too "basic". It has no replayability because of its complete emptyness. There is nothing to see, there is nothing to do and there is no hope it will change in the nearest future.\n\nFind your money a better use.\n\nEdit:\nIt looks like I've made a mistake stating that the game is in the development for 6 years. Actually according to this[crowdsourcecapital.blogspot.ru] article the game is being developed for 11 years. Eleven. Years.","December 7, 2015","false","1.1"," 87 of 113 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","87","113","0","1"

Surely some of you might think "Oh great, it's another one of those sh*tty games where people are only begging for money, instant downvote." okay, no, it's not as bad as it sounds, in fact, the game is quite decent even though it's a Unity engine based game, and I don't blame them for using such an engine, knowing how they got bankrupt a few years back. So far I will only say the game is in decent condition, not that many gamebreaking bugs, some neat coop and gameplay experience, and it's filled with good people (except for me, I am the biggest ♥♥♥♥ of the game... probably), the community is mostly lively, and one of the devs (A.K.A. ZPS.Bozar (the community manager)) make Monday and Tuesday (possibly Wednesday even) community gatherings to keep the community updated with what's going on, what are the plans, when will be the next update coughnextupdatecough, and some off topic randomness with a couple of good laughs and shooting eachother in the faces, because hey, that's what the game is about.\n\nSpeaking of updates, yes, this game gets updated monthly as soon as possible, while almost 95% of the updates do get delayed due to some bugs and glitches that seem to pose a threat on what the gameplay might end up like (stuff like missing keycard spawns in which they don't spawn at all, waypoint breaks, AI errors, falling through stuff and so forth), personally, even though the devs do put up annoying delays which just make us wait a few additional weeks for a hyped update to come out... and thus likely crash a train labled "Hype train" full of innocent people who are only looking to see what the game has to offer. But still, the devs always do it for a good cause, they want to make the game as solid and stable as possible, whilst also give a few balancing tweaks to make sure that no one is overpowered in any way, so that's always an up. And besides, all the scripting and modelling and animating and map making is not as easy as it sounds for a small dev team, really.\n\nBut now, onto the fun stuff: The gameplay.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty solid, you are brought in with so far two guns (an SMG and an assault rifle, more are on the way, so give it a wait), at 7 PvP maps, all with a constant changing enviroment and increasingly good atmosphere, which will always keep you on your toes. Several singleplayer maps which can be played in coop on certain servers (more on that later on), and right now, a gamemode called Deadlock (before it was Deathmatches and Team Dominations, though these will also be brought back soon enough in the later update). Personally I like the Deadlock gamemode, it's an onslaught of an 8v8 (if you're lucky to get in a full server) where the two teams have to either capture all of the 7 points or eliminate the entire enemy opposition before they lose all the zones or get mauled by the enemy force. It's like Insurgency with Skirmish, capture a point to get your team back, although in this case, it respawns only one but (hopefully) useful teammate which has died before, which is always a good thing to do, because having the enemy outnumbered is a always an up for your team, although, just because they have only one last marine standing (or LMS for short, that, or "That guy who is gonna die and fail our squad because he has no idea what he's doing.") can always, and I mean ALWAYS, make a turn to the game where in the end it's YOUR team that gets outnumbered, and guess what, it wasn't because your team sucks, it's because the enemy team knows where to go first, where last, where the enemy might be, what point to cap, where to camp, and so forth, it's all basically tactics that bring this up, and that's the best part, there is always a way for something to go right or painfully and horribly wrong, and the game can easily be twisted by a single person's actions, wether was it a point capture or an enemy neutralization... or just smart corner camping, HELL, ANYTHING GOES BASICALLY. But mainly, it's the teamwork that keeps the team rolling, covering certain areas to prevent flanking, reviving dead teammates next to you (did I tell you that there is actually reviving in the game? Well, I tell you now, there is reviving in the game, use it dammit) to keep the odds against the enemy, and usually an accurate aim and some good reflexes will be able to get you out of the frying pan (and possibly into the fire if you're unlucky enough...), even though some people say it feels a bit like CoD coughgodieinafirecough and a bit like quake, well, I might have to agree there a bit, it does have a slight feeling to it, but never too much, as one going CoD style against the enemy will have him killed and his team to utter failiure (never underestimate the enemy, they can always appear smarter than they look). As for the AI of the game... weellllll... let's just say they still have a lot to improve with their robots, since they're buggy as hell (running into walls, shooting at people's feet, staring at the sky for no apparent reason, did I mention running into walls?), but nonetheless always fun to play against on harder difficulties (Realistic is the highest difficulty, just so you know, and I recommend that difficutly to be palyed at all games and times), beacuse it will always give you more of a reason to use cover and move around slower, because a few shots means death. So yeah. Speaking of dying, headshots are always instakills, so keep your head somewhere safe at all times... no, not underneath a bucket you baka. In the new update they introduced a stamina and accuracy system, which will obvously affect how you aim and such, so don't run around too much or you'll be hitting everything but your target, plus, you'll be moving with the speed of a snail if you drain out completely, you have been warned.\n\nBut what are the singleplayer/coop games like?\n\nWell, so far there are 2 campaign mission, The Neurogen incident and Starcrown aerospace, which are both pretty good, even though Neurogen is a little bigger and darker, which is always good, while Starcrown is basically "Take that keycard to open that door so you can get a keycard to open that door so you can then pick up the intel thingy that looks like a keycard so you can open the evac zone and spawn tons of annoying robots which will blow your head off in a split of a second." ... That could've been better said, but sadly, I am being honest here. The Starcrown map is basically taking keycards to open doors like all the time... Still it does give the option to go through several enterances (Front door (my favorite), a side enterance at the left (which somehow looks more like a lobby...), a giant hangar door at the back, and a very convenient fence opening on the left storage area) which does give a little more variety to what ways you want to do this, always an up, even though in the end you end up Rambo-ing out to the evac zones with your friends, nevertheless a good laugh of constantly getting shot at. There are also several other coop maps, 2 Elimination maps (Mainline and Stronghold) in which you have to kill all the robots to win, 2 Survival maps (Colony and Operations) where you have to turn the power back on (CONTRADICTION + SPOILER ALERT: You actually end up turning the power off, not on, if you get the idea), and avoid getting killed by all the robots, and lastly an Escape map, in which you gotta get topside by doing some simple objectives.\n\nWelp, looks like I'm running out of space to type stuff, so I'm just gonna conclude this with a "Must have!". I would've typed in so much more if I had space, sadly, Steam hates me. :C\n\nBuy this game, buy the spearhead edition, support the devs, and I get a cookie.

The concept is good, but it seems the developers take forever to release updates and the game is still missing some extremely important mechanics to make it worthwhile. While the graphics and sound are fairly good there is not really much else to say in favour of the game at present.\n\n- You cannot create your own servers. You are limited to a handful that the devs provide which are map/gametype locked. Their "reason" for not releasing the server-side files is that they are scared people are going to reverse engineer it. Utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.\n\n- Only 2 weapons that are very similar.

Had it since the first days it was released and the game itself is growing quite quick for the time its been on steam. The bots in this game are very responsive and realistic, the player HUD is imersive and the only two weapons feel great. For now it has two coop missions with some lore and a few more that are just challenges, and it also contains some team pvp.

I didn't feel I could remove any more and still have the main points in the actual review and covered well enough to say most of what I wanted to say, so I decided to leave it for the time being. I might upload it elsewhere and link it here at some point.\n\nIn essence, I'd stated that while I wouldn't recommend it any more for multiple reasons, it was still a game people could potentially enjoy at least for a while before coming to the same conclusion as me and no longer enjoying / recommending it, and also a game that people could possibly be happy with from purchase up until it's completion (if it's completed). They focus too much on adding things and too little on keeping what they already have in a playable / enjoyable state. Too much on drawing people in with additions to make it look like they're making progress and too little on fixing the ever increasing number of bugs and making sure those additions are in a good enough state to feel like they add to the game, rather than detract from enjoyment. Too much on drawing in new players and too little on retaining those they already have.\n\n\nNow I feel I would not recommend it in the slightest, not even to those who look at the store page and recent gameplay and think “this looks like my sort of game!” because I don't know what the heck the devs are doing but I don't care for it.\n\nI have the following to keep things short (at least in this review..), however, to see some of my reasons for not recommending this game there'll be a fair bit of reading involved, and I can't guarantee that by the time you check these links out the threads won't be deleted.

Right now, I would recommend this game to anyone who wants a fun game to play with your friends or even random people online using the ingame VOIP.\n\nStuff the game has:\nEnemies - Robots, Real People (in multiplayer), TR-100's (they are all your enemy)\nGuns - SMG, Assault Rifle with 3x scope\nSingleplayer/Coop - Neurogen Incident, Nucleus Escape Mission, Operations (Swarm mode)\nMultiplayer - 5 or 6 maps with day/night cycles that happen while matches are happening\nIt has a HUD which can be disabled if you get shot but don't die. It will regenerate if you don't get shot for a little while longer.\nA ranking system which basically quantifies how experienced of a player you are. Your Training Rank goes up the more Training Points you have. The first ten levels are easy to get, and so are the next twenty or thirty. After that you notice it takes a little longer to level up. It takes 1000 TP to get to TR-10. It takes 100,000 TP to get to TR-90, then 200,000 TP to acheive TR-100.\n\nSo that's basically what it has. I glossed over a few things, for example, the maps. Some of the maps are dynamic, changing midway through the level, altering slightly how the game is played on that map (map name: Elevation, Colony).\n\nSHAMELESS PLUG - Youtube channel:  N00bvlog (n00bvlog) Now, back to your programmed content.\n\nThe Neurogen Incident is a huge coop map which could potentially be very creepy for you to play. You could play by yourself, but I would recommed playing coop because there are no checkpoints and if you die, you die, which could be very frusterating if you play for a long time and then lose all your progress. In coop, your team mates have the opportunity to revive fallen teammates during a span of 15 seconds before their team mate is gone for good. The map is huge and has some performance issues (which, I'm sure, are being worked on).\n\nThere are also some smaller missions which do not suffer from a performance hit quite as much.\n\nThere's a new gamemode called Hell Week. It is pretty fun when there are people to play it with. The gist of this mode is this: it goes up to 64 players who gather Combat Points throughout the game. You can get these points by either opening loot crates scattered around each of the 9 maps, killing players and picking up their points in a dropped backpack, or going for high risk, high reward supply drops. There are 9 aforementioned maps of differing themes: winter, jungle, moon, canyon... etc. Eventually a countdown timer starts and, after 2 minutes, the player with the lowest score gets eliminated from the game. The last 4 players to be alive have "survived the Hell Week" and have won the game.\n\nThere are 2 versions of the game mode. The first is basically called Hardcore Hell Week. If you die, you're dead. You can't get back into the game and have to wait 4 hours for another 'week' to start. This makes playing the game EXTREMELY intense. In the early iterations of HW, there was no team support. Once I tried to team up with a guy on VOIP. We spent a long time looking for each other. All of a sudden, he told me to jump. I jumped. He noticed me before I did and needed to quickly check to make sure it was me.\n\nNow that we had successfully teamed up, I got him to guard me while I hid in a bush so I could go AFK and pee.\n\nIt was super intense. Unfortunately, because people were frusterated at having to wait extended periods of time between Hell Weeks, ZPS made another version of HW that is the one we, for the most part, play today. In this newer version, you can respawn after you die. It doesn't become hardcore until about 30 minutes passes by. ZPS also implemented teams so you can team up with up to 3 other people and share your points across all team members. This makes die-ing less frusterating, but it also takes away the tense-ness of the gamemode for me.\n\nPerformance-wise, this game does not perform the greatest on my machine I seem to always get 30 FPS (a range of 15 - 45). Here are my specs so you can judge whether this is good or bad. Intel Duo core CPU running @ 3 GHz. RAM: 4GB, Graphics Card: Nvidia GTX 670.\n\nAs far as I know, the update schedule of the game is about 1 update per month.\nEDIT: due to the game selling poorly, there are fewer people working on the game. I estimate updates will take much longer than 1 per month now.\n\nSo, this game is coming along quite fine, and, with each update it is becoming more and more the game I want it to be (such is the nature of Early Access). Obviously it is not there yet, so if you want a full game that runs great, don't buy the game yet. Read another review in about a year or so. It should have many more features and potentially be optimized by then.\n\nUpdate: The game might come out before Half Life 3. Development has slowed. Even so, I still recommend it.\n\nHope this helps.","November 7, 2014","true","705.9"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","26","29","0","2"

That really doesn't help the developers. Probably because of the same people with disgusting attitude many games were abandoned.\n\nThis is really really beta, you have only a weapon, so you can understand how beta this is.\nFirst of all, i didn't spend much time in the game to be honest, but i can give you my opinion so far, i really think it can be helpful.\n\nI didn't encounter any glitches like i don't know, falling through the map, so far.\nThe game is well optimised but sometimes i get random FPS drops, but not very often.\n\nWhat can be improved:\nI love the shadows and the lighting, but i think you can work a little bit more on the shadows because sometimes you can confuse them with an enemy (or it might just be me).\nYou could also improve the running, it feels more like sliding. (some more work on the walking wouldn't be bad either)\nThe shooting mechanism, it doesn't feel very exciting or real.\nI love how weather changes and it starts raining, it is awesome, but since you have a helmet with some sort of face-protection i think the rain drops should slide, not just stick there.\nChat system, currently, honestly it is awful, i am pretty sure nobody likes to open a window to see the new messages from other players.\nAccuracy, for some reason it is kinda weird, it happened to me to shoot an entire clip into someone and ending up by getting killed (even if i burstly shot).\n\nSo far, i am impressed with this game, at this stage of the game, i honestly expected to see through walls, fall through the map, getting stuck inside the floor, maybe application not responding. So far, you really did a good job. And don't let this game go because of idiotic people who just rant about it without giving a constructive opinion, just because they couldn't read 'Early Access'.

When I first got it back on March 2015, it promised a unique FPS experience. The maps are very interesting and even after 230 hours of gameplay I still find myself discovering new approaches. The community is competitive, relatively small and friendly which was part of what made the game entertaining. However at it's current state where the devs choose to ignore people's frequent problems, I wouldn't recommend anyone spending money on this. The development process is very, VERY slow and I've been experiencing frequent crashing for the past 2-3 months which ruins the whole experience (and the current match most of the time). Rather than dealing with the more serious problem, the devs are simply adding skins to the game. Needless to say, the direction this game has taken is what makes me not recommend it.","January 12","false","234.9"," 34 of 43 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","34","43","3","3"

Realistic, and yet not too hard.  The guns will move a bit upwards if you hold the trigger, but is still controllable, and confortable, so it's not bad. Just like other good FPS games like Battlefield(s), Medal of Honor, etc. The scope on your assault rifle is 4x zoom, but only has 20, contrary to your main weapon, which is a SMG, and holds 30. Nevertheless, the assault rifle packs a big punch, and if used right, can prove useful as a sniper would. Very accurate and easy to use. The SMG however, is all a SMG is really; quick firing, red dot scope, light, 30 round clip. Overall I like them both for what they are; one is close range, the other long range.\n\nMaps\n\nSo I haven't done very many of the single player missons yet, but I've played all the online maps that there are, which is 9. All of them are fun in their own way. The winter one is very *cough*cool*cough*, the swamp map is a nightmere in the dark, but still freakily fun, and the others are well-made with lots of spots to hide behide, and lots of spots to round a corner and get shot in the face, or walk up to a building in the dark only to find out a guy is in the shadows *dead*. Overall, they're great maps in a sci-fi setting. You won't get bored of them very quickly.\n\nGadgets\n\nThe laser on the guns is awesome. You can see the point of it no matter where it is shining. (in the tree, on the ground, or 4 miles away) The only con about it is, in most maps whether in the dark, or rain, snow, etc, you can see the whole beam of light. Which makes it very easy to find the man holding the gun.\n\nThe flashlight is very bright, but gives you away in a *cough*flash*cough*. You have to pick the right moments to turn it on. if you're in a big room, and you think you saw someone, it's totally worth turning it on to get a kill. or at least see where you are in the pitch-black moments.\n\nThe silencer works, and I haven't noticed any reduced velocity as of yet.\n\nYou have unlimited ammo. Keep reloading till your R button is broken. I litterally reload even if I only used two bullets. A good habit to have.\n\nOverall the gadgets have their advantages and disadvantages. Once you start playing you figue out what works best for you.\n\nCONS\nGuns\n\nAlthough the two guns they give you by default are amazing, they do get old after awhile. And so far the game only has the two. I'm sure the devlopers will add more as they continue to add things to the game, but for now you'll have to live with the only two.\n\nTeam Killing\n\nOh yes, everyone's worst nightmere! Well, unlike other games that don't have team tags above players, this one does. The problem is once you get shot to a degree, your whole hub in your face screen shuts down for about 10 - 15 seconds.  In that time the person who shot you could be right outside the doorway, but the only way you can tell if it's him or your teammate is if you see a little blue on him, (which is hard to see anyways) as the friendly tags and all the digital things you see in the game are gone. (except your sites on the guns)  So yeah, there is a fair share of team killing, but it also makes it interesting for yourself when you get shoot.\n\nRespawning\n\nYes, when you die in an online match, (not co-op, I don't know what it's like for co-op) it takes about 100 - 120 seconds to respawn in a ten minute game. And you only have 15 seconds to be revived, which isn't very much at all, seeing is how you have to be careful in this game. But, if a teammate gets a kill, then a person get's to respawn early. or if someone captures a flag. So believe me when I say it's a team oriented game online.\n\nOverall I rate it 7/10. You will have lots of fun with it, and at the sametime get scared outta your pants in moments. And it's not finished, so get it now while it's on sale, because it's great deal.\n\n-------EDIT------- This is my first edit since a few weeks after I bought the game last February. Alot of things have changed. Hellweek was intreduced, then bots (CTR's) to hellweek. They added the pistol for the purpose of hellweek as that is your starting gun. (it's just a stripped version of the SMG just 15 round clip and semi auto with iron sites) One new map was placed into MP, and a 2nd one will be here in the next update. The weapons had a complete redo to make them more realistic. The game was upgraded to Unity 5. And alot of small things that really make a difference from a person who's played the game a ton.\n\nThe game itself is going through a hard time as of now because they're trying to implant new things but it's causing bugs while doing so. Even now they're trying to fix random game crashes that happens to just about everyone, and another bug that causing you to randomly fall through the floor. (Although that doesn't happen alot like crashes) The devs are working very hard to fix these issues, and once those get fixed, then we can see some fresh new content which  includes more co-op in the next few months.\n\nI have alot of hours, and it's because I love the PvP in this game, so much in fact that I joined a clan, and helped make that clan maybe the best clan in the game now. They're only a few clans in the game now, but that's mostly to blame because of the devlopment being slow and bugs causing fustration. Hopefully that will be fixed in the next few weeks, and Season 3 of the Phyregaming (.com for the website) league will start soon after these bugs are fixed.","February 10, 2015","true","799.3"," 50 of 72 people (69%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","69","50","72","7","1"

The promise in this game is amazing and I believe this deserves many more people to recognise it. Because I'm lazy however I'll head straight to Pros and Cons\n\nPros:\n- Amazing Atmosphere. especially in gamemodes such as Elimination, The game combines slight horror with a tactical shooting experience the likes of which I haven't seen before. In most games, putting a powerful weapon into the hands of the protagonist will help ease the "Spook Level", In this game it doesn't. Especially with the volume turned up high, hearing a robots fast running footsteps getting closer and closer behind you is INCREDIBLY nerver racking and I love it\n\n- Shooting mechanics work very well, this game isn't another Spray'n'Pray FPS Shooter. It has a very balanced shooting system with amazing hitbox accuracy. It forces you to focus on your targets and make sure your bullets land, because if they dont you may just find yourself full of them.\n\n- Tacticality, the game makes you think about your actions. Going around a corner in the dark may only be a good idea 70% of the time, this game creates that decision of whether or not to turn your flashlight on. Need to go through a door? As soon as its open everything near you knows where you are so be ready.\n\n- Amazing FPS. As long as you don't have the bug (which can be easily fixed yourself) where the game will use integrated graphics instead of your graphics card, the game runs very smoothely\n\n\nCons:\n- Multiple bugs, especially ones that have occured since the latest patch. However because this is early access this is to be expected\n\n- The devs don't update very often (or so I have heard). I feel like constant bug fixes are necessary for an early access game like this so I hope this improves\n\n- No option to host your own server to play with friends. You either play solo or join one of the servers available\n\n\nOverall the game is very solid, it has a lot of potential and is already a very enjoyable game with friends or without them. However I haven't found a way to host a server yet, but if it is possible please tell me it would be greatly appreciated.","January 31, 2015","true","3.1"," 56 of 83 people (67%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","67","56","83","7","0"

It is not like Counter Strike but both games share this.\nThe charging bots will sometimes scare the crap out of you. Sometimes they seem to come from nowhere.\nThe sounds of them moving are also VERY eerie. It reminds me of hearing the face huggers slither around in one of the earlier Alien games. Occasionally you will hear someone whispering, “Help me”. Eek.\nOverall, the atmosphere of this game is wonderful.\nThe game includes many types of gameplay even though it is early assess. Personally, I like the ones that are coop against AI.\nThe game is tactical. If you wander off on your own, you will likely soon die.\nBeing early access, the game is clearly not finished. The basic game does play well and is a blast in its current state. That said, there are issues. The game is not optimized well yet so lag can sometimes be an issue. There are not many on the servers but I have found if I join an empty one, others join. You can also play single-player but this game is not easy on your own.\nThe Dev’s have a lot to get done before they can call this complete and they are a small group. I like buying this type of game in early access as it is a lot of fun when patches are released. For being early access, the game is a blast and I would highly recommend it if you like tactical shooters, especially coop ones.\n","December 3, 2014","true","95.4"," 29 of 37 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","29","37","0","5"

Unlike some other Early Access games, Interstellar Marines has also been building on that promise, rather than tripping over itself constantly. It's got the best HUD in ages (A visor that actually reacts to the game world, with rain drops dripping down it, and damage eventually causing it to malfunction and no longer display friend or foe indicators. Hell, you can even open and close the visor if you want.), intense gunplay that Rainbow Six fans will instantly love, and, well, that's kind of it for now.\n\nAs much fun as being paranoid, scanning around dark rooms, flipping your flashlight on for a second before turning it off again so you don't give yourself away can be, it's not going to keep you coming back for more time and time again when all that is here is a few maps, a few modes, and two guns. A complete lack of the main focus, co-op play, is also rather jarring.\n\nStill, if you need a Rainbow Six fix, this is already one of the best choices you can make. And while the updates aren't frequent, they've been consistently high quality.

I do recommend it only because I'd like to see this game grow & expand. Unfortunately, it's an early access game. I normally do not like early access games, especially since most of them seem to not progress any further. However, despite the extremely slow development this game has been getting, it's on a steady course to becoming a complete game somewhere down the road. I already enjoy this game as is, and imagining it in it's complete stage years from now as a tactical shooter in a realistic sci-fi future excites me.\n\nThe community is fairly small and unless you've got a few friends to play with you're likely going to spend most of your time here in early access fooling around in single player fighting robots in a supposed "training simulation" as candidates for the Interstellar Marine program as we await the story to develop. There are two campaign missions plus two maps that host a terrorist hunt style mode, an escape mode, and a gauntlet mode of sorts. The multiplayer is what you would expect in a tactical FPS. There are some frame rate issues I've noticed.\n\nAll in all, if you got some money to spend and are looking to waste some time alone or with freinds, I'd definately recommend checking this out.","July 3, 2015","true","5.0"," 31 of 41 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","31","41","2","0"

Some would argue for a review that is all that matters. However for an Early Access title that has been in development for who knows how long, the developers are also on equal grounds to be judged. Perhaps things will get better in time, but as of right now Zero Point Software is not a developer I will support any longer. The way they have treated this community lately has been nothing but disgraceful and disrespectful. The video they released is thankfully being taken down, but that will never fix any issues regarding their treatment of the community. Here is a link to a thread from Reddit, which explains everything. I will also link the third thread regarding the subject that was created by me, since the other two threads were locked.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/cbR1R\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/236370/discussions/0/541907867777620602/\n\nZPS's treatment of the community has been nothing but locking threads, making constant threats, permantley banning users, and not even hinting that they are taking anything I or any other member have put forward regarding not only the video but the treatment of their paying customers. They clearly don't care about feedback, and they clearly don't have the foresight or basic common sense to think about their actions before they make them. I tried to be as civil and respectful as possible, and they have yet to answer the points and reasoning I put forth explaining why members were upset, and why the video was not a good idea to begin with. I will never get a response, and it is also clear they could care less. Until this developer proves it can be mature and understanding, you should not entrust them with completing a game such as this. The image for Interstellar Marines was a beautiful one, and after all these years they have barely anything to show for it, aside from their harrassment of customers who bought their game out of support and trust. They have lost my support and have broken everyone's trust. Maybe when they begin to take some responsibility for their actions there could be hope, but I am doubtful and will no longer try to provide feedback. They had their chance to prove themselves apart from the usual EA dev. They failed not only themselves, but their community. As such I can not recommend the game for the shape it's currently in, or the prospect that it will ever be what it could have been.","August 9, 2015","false","0.3"," 58 of 90 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","58","90","2","20"

This now being the top review, I feel that I should elaborate.\n\nI bought into this game very early. I'm not sure why it shows my game time as little as it does, as I played this game for proabably around ~30 hours or so. I have periodically tried this game, hoping for some significant changes to it, but it really feels like the same game it was 3-4 years ago. Sure there have been some cosmetic changes, and it is a very beautiful gtame now, but it took them over a year to even add another gun to it, making for gameplay that got stale very quickly.\n\nAt this point you can still enjoy this game with a friend. The co-op definitely has some fun left in it, but there are better co-op experiences elsewhere. If this game is finally completed and has a significant single-player or co-op campaign that is worth buying, then I will update my review. Until such time I just really can't recommend a game that has felt stagnant and doesn't seem to offer much hope of improvement.\n\nOne of my major issue is that I bought into this game because it claimed it was going to be a role-playing fps, it even still claims they plan to impliment this feature. I was hoping for this game to offer a new and unique fps experience, and really believed in the devs vision. But when 3 years later and these elements are nowhere to be found, the game ends up just feeling like another bland fps, and there are plenty other, finished, fps's that are worth playing over this one. There just isn't currently anything that this game offers that you can't find elsewhere save for the cool helmet mechanic (which adds nothing to gameplay).\n\nI'm not claiming the devs stole my money, or even saying it's a bad design or crap game. I simply would not recommend this game that feels stagnant, has never implemented rpg elements, and does not have enough people playing, making it difficult to find a full server nearby\n\nI am not directly faulting the devs either. I understand that bad things happen even to good, well-meaning devs with a good vision. This game may still have hope, and could end up being amazing. But in the end, this is a review, and overall I would not recommend this game in the state that it is in. I just feel that currently I would not recommend to my friends for them to buy this game. That's my general gauge for a thumbs-up or down, would I tell my friend to buy this game? If in the future if it is finally at least close to the final vision I will absolutely update my review.","March 31","false","1.3"," 94 of 154 people (61%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","61","94","154","8","13"

A more tactical approach to FPS shooters is a great approach, AND it's the only Sci-Fi shooter (besides the Halo series) that I like. But here is the underlying problem at its core. This game has made little progress in recent years.\n\nAt its current state, the game looks like a very early access game. Of course, the steam page supports this. However, the game has been out for a couple of years now. It has not significantly improved since the launch.\n\nShould you buy it? If you have patience. The developer is struggling to keep its footing. They haven't released any updates in months (Aug 2014).\n\nI wouldn't recommend it until more content is released.

The addition of suppressors for both firearms is great because this not only affects online play with players, but also the robots.\n\nSo yeah, you can be a ♥♥♥♥ and send all the robots a'runnin' to you and your squad.

Even though there are some premises and technology that are currently not existent in modern day, it feels realistic. I feel like that in ten years or so, this is could be reality, especially with good physics, annoyingly lifelike recoil, pain and exhaustion wobble and other environmental effects on your condition and visor. The 'realistic' difficulty is certainly true to its title: it is a true challenge to complete tasks with that difficulty active.\n\nFirst off: gameplay. As of yet there are about 10 singleplayer missions of ranging objective, such as escaping a space station, clearing an area of hostiles, or restoring power to a building. In every mission you have two long weapons (no handgun, which I am not personally happy with) : one for longer range sniping, and one for fast, full auto, close range bursts. Recoil makes handling both of these weapons a great task, especially when scoped in. A silencer, laser and flashlight can be utilized at any time. The enemies are (in every mission I've done so far) robots. They have fairly good AI, and can be pretty fearsome when charging out of the darkness with ear splitting shrieks and slamming you around. They can recognize your flashlight and triangulate your position accordingly. Some are armed with weapons similiar to your own, and some use only their limbs. As for co-op/multiplayer: it's amazing. I love it. Some of the best co-op I've ever played in any game, ever. The tactical potential is immense. Working with your team mates to complete objectives and eliminate other players or robots is the best feature of this game. Nothing to be missed there. I personally much prefer the co-op to the multiplayer, as objectives often seem distorted and chaos seems to ensue in player vs. player scenarios. It is also frustrating to be killed in dark maps, where your enemies may be in a shadow, so they are invisible (or practically so) to you, but you are standing under a light. There is also no spawn protection, which can also prove to be aggravating.\n\nSecondly: graphics. Absolutely stunning. The vigetting, superb textures and smooth atmospheric lighting truly makes this game a joy to look at. Some of the best lighting work I've seen in a long time. The way that each map has it's own feel and atmosphere is almost completely a result of the fantastic graphical work by the developers. 10 years have obviously been put to good work. The sound design is also very good. The maps are dynamic, as they change weather, time of day and general status (emergency lockdown, totally silent, in tranisition, etc.). In each mode, the sound adds very well to the atmosphere. The sound of the rain is consistent; robots' groans and creaking adds to the tension and fear of a startling encounter; the overwhelming sound of gunfire accurately represents how an actual warzone would sound.\n\nAnd now, the conclusion.\nSingleplayer --> 8/10\nGraphics --> 9/10\nCo-op --> 9/10\nMultiplayer --> 7/10\nReplay Value (singleplayer) --> 7/10\nSound design --> 9/10\nOverall --> 8/10. Fantstic game, would recommend to any sci-fi/simulation/FPS/tactical fan.","March 26, 2015","true","12.3"," 22 of 28 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","22","28","0","0"

Worth it and just different enough to keep you playing. Progress is always being made.\n\nThe multiplayer is still very solid, and enjoyable. The game modes are different enough to not get boring even after a quite a few matches. The weapons are very balanced and responsive, along with the flashlight and laser they don't feel the same at all. Game has enough players to always find a server with enough people to enjoy yourself.\n\nThe co-op is really incredible, can't say how long it has been since had a co-op game where me and my buddies could really explore a level and attack the mission the way we would like to. Very large and open mission with plenty of interesting things to see and fight. The AI are quite smart, and will give you one hell of a challenge and a freight.\n\nPerformance is still on the rough side, but still making improvements to it on the regular, I maintain a regular 40+ even with the not so good areas of the mission that are very well unoptimized.\n\nThis game still of course has a long way to go.

It shows much promise as a cooperative sci-fi tactical shooter.\n\nUnfortunately, the developers have seemingly directed all resources toward the game's versus modes.  While the versus isn't bad by any means, other games (Insurgency) do it better.  The last six months or so have been dedicated to a versus mode they call "Hell Week", that as far as I can tell, nobody asked for and the majority didn't/doesn't want.\n\nThese devs had a lot of cool ideas that they have thrown to the wayside.  At this rate, Star Citizen will be out before this game's dead on arrival campaign.  Unless they shift gears again, save your money.\n\nThen again, if you can pick this up for between $5-10 on a sale, I would wholeheartedly recommend picking it up and seeing where it goes with me.

A round end's, after your team took all points or eliminated the whole opposing team. Every week there are community gatherings for EU and US where you can play with Dev's and IM-Progamer from different clans, to have a nice talk in the chat or in teamspeak. At christmas they add a funny Terminator PVP mode where one player is totally overpowered with a special-damage weapon and armour so you have to take the T-IM101 down as team or you die several times :)\nAnd the great Wargame (Hellweek) PVP Arena within 8 completely different maps (on the moon surface, in the jungle, mountains, wetlands, industrial environment and more) where you have to fight against bots and other players, collect weapons and ammo, points and marked air drops. You can play alone or teamup with other players in wargames, but after one hour the team or the first four player with the highest points will win and the round is over ,then you have to wait a few minutes until the next wargame-arena event starts. The enemys in Interstellar Marines are two kind of robots, a runner (weapon: fist) and a gunner. But there will come more, i wait hard for the alien race: the landsharks.

This game keeps you on your toes, and gets my heart-racing with intense king of the hill combat.\n\nEdit as of 2016\n\nI'm still playing the game, so that probably says something.\n\nSince my initial review they've added crouching, and jumping; as well as two new weapons, three new game-modes, co-op and singleplayer missions.  The communtiy is still one of the best I've ever been a part of, and the gameplay is still fun, and enjoyable.\n\nI've probably bought 20 or 25 copies of this game for friends of mine over the past two years.  As of now, the Dev team has shrunk a lot, and they're looking for a publisher before they start doing any major updates; but if you're fine with just a smei-competetive shooter, and some neat co-op on the side with a fun community, you're $10 will be well spent.\n\nI've gotten over 250 hours of enjoyment (and counting) out of my $10; that's a pretty good return if you ask me, since it took less then an hour for me to make that $10...\n\nEvery purchase helps this company, ZPS, continue pushing forward to creating and polishing up an amazing game, and if you're okay with mostly multiplayer now, and are hopful for more in the future; I'd highly reccomend picking this one up.","December 21, 2013","true","260.3"," 50 of 81 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","50","81","0","2"

But still has the best multiplayer there, on its current state, the game is better than others out there. The co-op mode is awesome, totally tactic, move like a real team, covering the rearguard, taking care each other... And you will be scared. Trust me in here. There are seven co-op maps for now (2 coop campaign levels and 5 coop challenge levels) but you don't need more. The single player is more of the same, tactic, unforgiven, hard... You feel even more fear... cause you will be alone. There is now Hell Week, a pvp and pve online mode, with the style of the Hunger Games, you need survive, finding ammo, weapons, making team with other players (or being a lone wolf)... in a changing environment, a really hard mode, doesn't forgive a mistake.\n\nYou need to play as a team, understand the battlefield, think each move, do not rush. You can feel the stress of a battle, the pressure, the fear. It's realistic and raw. The changing environment, fighting in dynamic places, you can see around you and suddenly complete darkness (literally). Accesses that appear and disappear, rain, snow, changing ground level...\nThe game has a incredible sound system, you can hear the steps of an enemy and anticipate to its movement, hear it while reloading its gun behind a corner, hear it running on the floor above you... The wind hitting your helmet, the rain dropping on it... The best treatment of the sound, outstanding.\n\nThere are people who criticize the game, but they don't understand that without their support is very difficult to continue development the game...The devs need all our support, because the game is made entirely independent and with passion, and money doesn't grow on trees ya know. So do not listen to those negative votes, because the game is incredible, the best. Buy the game, then buy another copy to your friends and repeat, because that money is the one producing the game, and with our support the game will become an indie AAA game.\n\nThe best community that can be found it's in here. The best. What a community! I dare you, I double dare you, to find such a committed, friendly, dedicated and awesome community. We all know each other.\nThe best developers are here, involved with the community. There is even a competitive environment already, with clans and tournaments.\n\nWe don't play Interstellars Marines, we live it, because those who really see beyond this game, love it, because all of this is  FOR THE LOVE OF THE GAME.","April 6, 2015","true","467.8"," 25 of 36 people (69%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","69","25","36","14","2"

Funny thing is they've never added the Hall of Honor, or Credits. [probably because it's not officially, "released."]\nHonestly, IM is a great idea. It's actually been released for way longer than people think - there was a kongregate version like 5/6 years ago where it was just a training simulator and you couldn't move around much. I also talked a friend into getting the game since it had alot of potential like 2 years ago when the game was almost exactly the same game it is today.\n\nhttp://www.interstellarmarines.com/game/ where you can play those Demos\n\nI have a theory as well that this is all a dream/VR training simulator in the reality of the I.M. world.\n\nThis is a good game though barebones, it's not worth buying unless the Developer team[which is about 2 people from what I see going on in forums] secures major money[that won't come from sales] in order to develop the game. It seems to me what they're trying to do now is make a presskit to get another company involved in the making, so the game would finally get made. I guess it's better that the game be finished although I doubt it'll happen the way they want it to if another company picked it up.\n\nBottomline Unless you see yourself playing the game with your active friends I would steer away.\nBUT OFC the way to fix ALL Of these negative reviews is just to add content - make the game worth playing. The game mechanics right now are pretty much perfect except for stuff like prone and upgrade trees for skills/stuff like that... you would think that in the future we would have light intensity adapting visors.[when we have this in real life already]\nI honestly would not mind if you guys added a bunch of content and then cleared the reviews just to see how the current build would stack up w/ people.\n\nFor now here's what the game offers:4 Player Co-op: 2 maps of Elimination, 2 maps of Survival, 1 map of Escape, 2 long-length story missions.\nPvP: 8 Vs. 8 I believe in Deadlock and Elimination\nVarying A.I. Difficulties from I can't see you! to 1-shot you're dead :)\n\nUnfortunately, nothing is "really new" since the Neurogen v3 update from way BACK.\n\nPros+ Great Idea\n+ Good for groups of 4 friends or more, if you're playing Hell Week.[warning points split]\n+ No achievements that are really too hard if you get medium skilled players together, so it'll be a blast for a group of FPS loving friends.\n+ standard PVP[nothing too special or different from the rest]\n+ Great PVE\n+ Sound is perfect.\n+ Combat points - Weapon/Backpack/Camo Skins, but a very weak positive in order to increase replayability.\n\n\nCons- The money already spent in making this game - it's been years since that initial fanfunding project. I know that the main dev only does graphical stuff, but maybe try taking on programming interns from your local college/DIY groups, so that they can get credits.\n- Shark mainpoint of IM has yet to be released into the game.\n- Only a few people behind this game now AFAIK.\n- Low game population.\n- E time to get magazines?\n- Old issue of Pistol...I do not want this in my inventory/want an option to drop this piece of ♥♥♥♥/don't want to mousewheel to this gun when i'm empty on both of the automatics + looks too much like an SMG. I think you guys need to remodel it to something more traditional. Honestly, we're carrying a carbine length pistol[~15inches], sub-machine gun[~11inches] and a RIFLE[18+ inches]?\n- No shotguns\n- No snipers\n- Hell week is boring because there's not enough robot action, but it shouldn't be like every inch is a battle, but more robots than it currently has.\n- No improvements/additions to A.I./Robotic Enemies AFAIK.\n- Fall through map bug[Just rejoin the game unless you're alone then you're screwed]\n- You can clip through closing doors\n- So2 should be o2 or Co2\n- Groups of Robots[deadly] suddenly spawning in front of you\n- Non-solid floors/areas of glitching to abuse.\n- No penalty of PKing in Hell Week regardless of intercom stating that there is a penalty ,-,.\n- No Prone\n- Robots can blind you through walls with flashlight\n\n*note to developers*\nIf you could get your game featured at a gaming con it would probably be a huge boon to your game's success though you'll have it pick up/release things faster like bi-weekly.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/gPOOcdoFGXY\n\nSpecifics The IM Project began 11 years ago. In order to secure funds they began by releasing a few Demos through public game places like The Vault, Bullseye, and Running Man. The greenlit Steam game was released on July 2, 2013 and I can't remember back then if the game was just barebones PvP, or had the Co-op Missions as well.\n\n"On October 2012, Zero Point Software attempted to do a Kickstarter campaign with a $600,000 pledge by November 28, 2012. Their campaign failed to meet its funding goal, with only $157,906 raised from 3,823 backers."\n\nThat's a shame that they didn't get the money even if the campaign failed :(\n\nEx. List of expenses...\nElectricity, Building Rental if not working at a home which is way more economical of indie devs, Musical Composition[people say it could cost Free, or $280-$2000 per song/minute/soundtrack], The main developer is graphical, so it's down to coding[huge job], server costs[anywhere to $20-$400+/month], food, sound effects, special effects, ect.\n\nI guess it's good that we even got the 1st part of the trilogy done if you assume the $200k mark is where they were splitting the money per part.","May 8","false","46.5"," 26 of 38 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","26","38","0","6"

Its a nice solid shooter base, with incredible immersion. The atmosphere that the game creates in the basic stealth missions turns it into a slight horror game! The training bots that the Singleplayer puts you up against, make some really nice sounds which makes it easy to tell where they are; but this just makes the stealth more tense! I play quite a lot of horror games, and this was making me jump on a regular basis. There is nothing "Scary" about the game. Its a standard FPS. But the atmosphere that the game makes caused me to get rather scared just walking around the stealth mission!\n\nMost definatley reccomended.

The depressing part is that in the TWO YEARS it's been in Early Access on Steam, it hasn't progressed past the early stages of development.

In example you're actually playing in a virtual battleground which changes its' weather settings, platform levels and there is "day/night" cycle.\n\nThe gameplay has a realism aspect in its' own way. Projectile damage is high. Dark is really dark; you have to find your way with your flashlight and using momentary lightings such as thunder or a malfunctioning light sources etc. You have a helmet which contains your GUI but time by time it limits your view because of raindrops or dusty particles on the helmet glass; so you have to elevate its' front side from your face.\n\nSo, why don't i recommend this game to you (...yet)? Simple: Updates are occasional, framerate is still horrible despite the fact that developing process started a long time ago. Gameplay elements are still missing according to their gameplay plans but it's kind of OK. It has a dedicated player community as i see but they are few (or they are just playing the game when a new update comes).\n\nKeep this game in your mind if you like tactical shooters but don't buy it yet.","August 29, 2014","false","2.9"," 37 of 59 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","37","59","0","2"

It's been two years since the multiplayer shooter portion of the game released, and there's just no development toward campaign aspects whatsoever. There are a few maps to shoot robots in, a few maps to shoot people in, and your choice of Gun A or Gun B.\n\nThe environments look great, the gunplay is serviceable, but development is downright glacial. It's looking less and less like we'll see a sprawling space epic with Land-Sharks before 2050 (or rather, before the money runs out).\n\nIf all you want is to shoot some bland test dummies or creep around in the same 5 or so maps, then by all means buy in. If you're looking for a co-op shooter where you fight sharks, you'd be better served by 'Depth' or 'Shark Attack Deathmatch 2' here on Steam.","October 1, 2015","false","15.9"," 25 of 38 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","25","38","0","0"

Stay away from it.. I bought it when it came out.. Hardly touched it.. been waiting for my Sweet coop experience.. Well that is never coming now.. Cause the development plan was made by a 3 year old with no hinesight whatsoever..\n\nHMMm Were losing most of our playerbase? What can we do?\n\nADD MORE PVP MAPS AND SKINS THAT LOOK ALL THE SAME WITH LITTLE EFFORT THAT WILL BRING THEM BACK!!\n\nBut why not add coop mode against thos shark enemies we promised?\n\nTHEY ARE A GLITCHY MESS!!

And anyone writing a positive review is lying out of there asses as they hope enough suckers will buy it and throw more money the developers way in hope that it will be enough to save this piece of garbage.. But no.. Do not fall for it. .Let this die out.. I paid for it.. I relize my mistake.. Why whould i load my sinking ship with more hopefull spirits.\n\n♥♥♥♥ THIS GAME.\n\n\n\n\nAnswer to Ypulse comment:\n\nReign of kings. Life is feudal has people on 24/7, H1Z1 got people one 24/7. This doesn't.. And anyone owning the game knows that. Sure maybe occasinly a server would get some people.. Perhaps even fill up? But that I doubt. And now you as everyother pathetic individual trying despretly to defend there garbage pile. You pull your last card, By stating how low amount of play time I have.\n\nYou know who else did that? Digital homicide against Jim sterling Took his video down and stated that he individualy violeted the copyright as the review was not based on what was there view on a minimal play time on record to be able to provide a valid review.. The truth sadly for your kind is that there is no minimum time.. Of course someone with 500h+ may have deeper insight to a game then somone with 50min but most of the time then it proves that the game is actually good.. As if somone can waste 500+ on the game it should add up to something and I yet find many people shouting out a bad review after that amount of time If not it been based on a recent update that the developers pushed out that changed the game drasticly for the worse.\n\nStill none should be forced to implement a certain amount of time to be able to state there opinion, specialy when the fact exist all around you. I did not need more then 10 min For Garry's shity incident, I did not need more then 5 min for zombies on a plane.. I needed not more then 2h for this game..\n\nNow this 2h LOL..  As you so kindly stated is about 10 min each put out in 12 sessions.. the game never manage to capture me for more then 10 min in each session as i notice it was a bland shooter with some interesting ambient lightning effects that i can praise but not much there else. And the game developers themself have both in video and devblog stated that this was going to be a core COOP experience and pvp was going to come second.. Still there effort and Development plan has and still to this days proves otherwise as they continue to jam in things direclty aiming for the pvp and even less focuse for the coop.. I not seen anything done for the coop in the past 6 months. The game simply in coop action is. you and 3 others, Sneak/assault in on a base with stupid Robot AI that wanders around and have aimbot if you turn them up for anything more then normal. And any announcement for further plans seems to be going down the drain and i bet it's cause of financial problem. And here Is where it becomes sad..\n\nThat the fanboys themself must despretly throw out positiv reviews in hope of dragging more innocent souls to the fire in hope that the body pile will become big enough to climb up to the heavens themself.. SOmething I doubt very much as the company itself most likely are looking for an exit plan as I write this..  But I keep your opinon to a very facinating level.. And If they and if so you.. proves me the wrong. .Then win/win as i myself was looking forward to this game.. I just don't feel the need to lie to other people to get to my toys.","March 24","false","2.0"," 33 of 53 people (62%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","62","33","53","3","20"

Graphics are very nice.\n- Simple controls yet very immersive and very to understand.\n- Extremely immersive in nearly every aspect (Massive +).\n- Being stealthly is very rewarding (Mentally and in the game).\n- CO-OP is slightly more fun than single player.\n- Not the hardest game to run, but will require a decent PC.\n- Guns feel very nice and play better than i thought they would.\n- A.I is very smart, even on easy difficulty.\n- Devs seem to be more active than other communitys which is good.\n- Potentially great story.\n+ And a few more that i forgot xD\n\nCons:\n- Reloading while in cover is broken. The animation dosn't work correctly.\n- Hardly anyone online to play with, even the devs know. "people will be on for you to play with, it is usually during the evenings in North America and Europe."\n- When on some hard difficultys the A.I is a little too smart. They one shot very often.\n- Sandbox is sometimes broken. You fall striaght through the floor and never return which results in restarting the map.\n- A.I needs to be more... 'Workable'. Once you've been spotted, you're done for. The A.I, when aware you're around, totally ruine the immersion, i mean completely!\n- No checkpoints! This might be deliberate but holy crap is it fustrating. You play through a long missions then you make a wrong move, guess what? You're back at the start. Same goes for CO-OP. When you join they could be across the map and you're at the spawn.\n- Story is terrible. You start on the tutorial which is great fun, then... wait what? You're running around in some random facility. Story has been thrown out the window completely. Wrost thing is that the story has great potential.\n\nI would recommend that you buy this game. even though there are more cons than pros, because i think that if the devs stay active and keep updating then this will be something. This game has great potential, i believe, and i would like to see a more active community on it.

However the atmosphere is really well done.  Despite it's current simplicity the dark atmosphere and ability to shoot out lights to make it even darker is an unusual factor in the multiplayer FPS genre (which tend to have reasonably lit dark places or else supply night vision).\n\nAlong with the dark and deathly silent atmosphere you have enemies which are humanoid robots, however, as boring as that may seem, i've never had robots freak me out this much.  Some of them are like fast zombies but they sneak right up on you before slapping you silly.\n\nMy favourite factor of this game is definitely the fact that you get the feeling you're the only ones alive.  All there is is silence, that is very realistically unnerving when broken by sudden un-silenced gunfire.\n\n\nThere are some issues with objective bugs and flashlights not rendering from other players, i find the walking/movement to be a bit jerky and awkward, and as i said there isn't much content yet: limited guns, only 2 types of enemy with the same model, and fairly empty maps.  While i like the atmosphere, i hope the game won't all be quite so barren and basic (when it comes to missions and so on).

"Sorry guys". Sorry doesn't cut it. That's not just a PR problem that can be solved with an apology. An apology didn't cost you $43.00.

Need More Underwear/10\n\nIn all honesty the game is awesome. I have been eyeing this game for awhile, and I saw it on sale for $15. I told myself "Now is my chance." I am glad I purchased it. Its challenging, and it forces you to take things slow. The first mission I did took me just over an hour. I was playing solo though. The game could use some optimization or at least let me turn shadows off completely. I am in the Army and live in the barracks, so I don't really have room for my desktop. I am playing on a decent laptop. It can run BF3/BF4 on Ultra no problem. I get a steady 30-40fps (@1280x720) when inside buildings, but sometimes when I am outside  it drops to about 20-25. I honestly didn't care because I felt it added to the overall tension and anxiety. I can usually never handle below 30fps, but this game has just got me hooked.\n\nRig Specs:\nNvidia GT740m (Running 1280x720)\ni7 4700MQ @ 2.44GHz\n8GB DDR3 RAM\n\n","December 31, 2014","true","4.9"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","0"

The product is not yet finished and it will be a little while longer before we have a full single player campaign. However, what is there is very good, by no means perfect, but very good none the less, and I have no hesitation in recommending it in its current state.\n\nWhats good:\n* Lots of different game modes, with the main game being team based PvP, but also a 4 player Coop story mode vs bots, and various other co-op player vs bots modes.\n* The AI on the bots is fun to play against and they offer a genuine challenge, and have on more than one occasion made me jump.\n* Very focussed gameplay, there are only 2 weapons and limited ammo in each clip, so every shot counts\n* Great community of people playing, there is quite a lot of chatter on the servers with players, and people are generally quite nice, funny, helpful.\n* Quick loading times to get into games\n* Great respawn idea, basically when you die you have to wait 2 mins before respawn, but if your team captures zones you get to respawn earlier. This makes the game quite tactical and differentiates it over your usual COD, counterstrike type gameplay.\n* The game can be tough for beginners, but experienced players can be quite helpful, so stick at it and it will come to you\n* The developers are occasionally found playing with/against you, this gives the feeling that they also enjoy playing the game and adds an extra bit of fun when they do.\n* Day/night mode on maps; the night mode makes things especially interesting, how often do you use the flashlight to see where you are going vs giving your position away. The positional sound of footsteps also can give you away / help you find people.\n* A bunch of other things I can't be arsed to type.\n\nWhats bad:\n* Despite selling a lot of copies of the game, and there being quite a lot of servers, only 1 or 2 of the main ones tend to fill up. However, once you are in at the right time of day the games are fun, in fact I have had quite a few 2v2 or 4v4 games that were amazing.\n* Lag. This to me is the games biggest issue, and can be quite frustrating at times, however, again with experience you can compensate for it by firing ahead of target. If there is one thing that needs some more TLC its the lag compensation and reducing overall lag when connecting to servers.\n* I play a lot of counterstrike and miss not being able to melee people, i would take anything over nothing, even if you had to charge melee up before striking. The prestige of being able to sneak up on someone and stab them in the back and embarass them would make this game twice as good.\n* Not much else other than its not finished, but like I said this is still a very good and polished game\n\nOverall if want something a bit different then this game might be for you, also you can test some of the early stuff out on their website before committing: http://www.interstellarmarines.com/ or even watch a few videos of it on youtube:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/results?filters=hd&search_query=interstellar+marines&lclk=hd&spfreload=1\n\nedit: added link","November 15, 2014","true","229.7"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","2"

There is ONLY multiplayer and the 7 maps which you can look around/play in multiplayer.\n\nHaving said that, this game is surprisingly polished for an alpha.. there is so much immersion, firing a weapon takes time to master and adds a good level of depth to the game. The weather changes on the maps, sometimes it goes pitch black or foggy which completely changes the tactics you use. Currently the game is also very balanced (due to there only being 1 weapon) so it feels satisfying to get good at the game knowing no one has an advantage.\n\nSome issues you need to be aware of: currently there is only 1 gun in the game and couple of game modes (team domination being the most used and the best), there are some issues with hit detection and lag *make sure you pick a server with low ping however even then you'll need to learn to lead the target a bit more etc* (also make sure you turn off smoothing in the options to help with this). They are fixing this but for now it's there. Also there is no crouching in the game, no leaning or anything like that.. I believe they want to add in these features.\n\nIn conclusion, this is definatly an early alpha with many features missing... however I believe that the current strengths of the game (immersion, satisfying shooting and balanced multiplayer) make this 100% worth the asking price which will also help them continue development. Have a look at some more recent videos and make your judgement, it's changed a lot over the past month (december).","January 6, 2014","true","840.9"," 18 of 27 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","18","27","0","6"

This is less of a recommendation and more of a warning.  The only current content consists of stripped down multiplayer and no single player at all.  You can walk around the multiplayer maps by yourself but that is it.  Basic things like jumping and crouching are currently missing from the game as of my writing this, sprinting was patched in about a week ago.  There is literally no weapon diversity and no AI.  I'm not saying this game won't turn into something worth playing, but right now it is not.  I'm not sure what to expect though, considering development began in May 2005, over 8 years ago.

But now in 2013 I had just received the game by a friend of mine who was a donator in the kick starter and had spearhead edition. When I opened this game I was surprised what they have done already ever since with their bankrupt and situations. They had been training really hard for an amazing comeback, and dedicate their whole life to this majestic game. The features at the moment may not seem much but it's worth the money. The feature it has is a wonderful dynamic environment and a normal run & gun at the moment. They had recently changed the game mode on all servers to Team domination, therefore you would have to work with your team to win the matches. This game is still pre-alpha, so don't expect this being the final product, because they have a whole set of ideas to add in this game. Such as, a realistic tactical co-op campaign that makes you feel like that you are an actual marines in space with your friends fighting land sharks and having a first contact with aliens.\nLinks for more information on Interstellar marines:\nhttp://www.interstellarmarines.com/\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/ZeroPointSoftware","November 26, 2013","true","53.7"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"

Although it is in alpha, it is a great game. Plus, it's not as expensive as it WILL be, and all updates are FREE when you buy. ZPS is doing a great job fixing as many bugs as they can in their timeline while also adding features at a pretty constant pace, and do an EXCELENT job of listening to the community.\n\nCurrent features include:\n*Sprinting - Hold shift to sprint, and tap to toggle run on and off.\n*Jumping - Press space to jump; Timing the release of the spacebar enables a slightly larger jump.\n*Stamina - Sprinting and jumping reduces stamina.\n*Crouching - reduces height of the model of the player and the hitbox.\n*Sliding - While sprinting, hit the crouch button (Glitch - this feature currently breaks the hitbox of the player. To be fixed soon).\n*Recoil - basic realistic recoil on weapons.\n*Weapons: SMG - mid-short range 1.5(ish)x holo-sight. AR - long-mid range 2(ish)x scope.\n*Revive - Press and hold <key> to revive a downed teammate (until the circle fills)[15 seconds after being downed players will "bleed out"].\n*Tutorial - Basic "what to do to move, interact, and kill" tutorial, and introduces Bots.\n*Bots - AI controlled robots that can be set to different difficulties in the settings menu (I suggest Normal for beginners, and Realistic for those who are willing to die a few times)[TUTORIAL REDUCES ACTUAL DIFFICULTY].\n*Two "campaign" missions - Neurogen Incident and Assault on Starcrown Aerospace\n*Challlenge modes - Survival, Elimination, Nucleus Escape (map), Get Killed by Bots(single-player map).\n*Online Multiplayer modes: Deadlock - Capture points to respawn teammates, final marine revives a teammate on a kill, first to eliminate enemy team or capture all points wins (Respawn timer - 120 seconds). Team Death Match - Kill the enemy team until time runs out. The team with most kills wins (Respawn Timer - 15 seconds). Team Domination - Control the point to remove tickets from the enemy team, first to reach zero tickets loses (Respawn Timer - 10 seconds). Free for All - Pretty dang self-explainatory (Respawn timer - 15 seconds).\n*HARDCORE MODE - Hellweek : Servers of a max count of 64 players open once every few hours. Start out with a pistol with 15 rounds. Run around the 9 different maps collecting points, ammo, and guns, while avoiding/stalking/killing other players. Last 4 players have their points recorded to the global leaderboard. And, as is par with most hardcore games, NO RESPAWNS.\n*Server lists: Multiplayer - AU, JP, USW, USC, USE, BZ, EU, RU servers, ping listed (ping is not accurate, just gives the ballpark with some exceptions). Coop - Same server regions as multiplayer, Includes both "campaign" missions, survival and elimination maps, and Nucleus escape (ping same as multiplayer server list)(There is an app on the steam forums that has accurate pings.

It is starting to have that excellent charm that I mention more so than before; and almost makes me feel like I am playing a spiritual successor to the old Rogue Spear series; which is great. In case you guys aren't as ancient as I am; Rogue Spear was a old Tactical FPS where you would go on missions to destroy, protect, survive, rescue, etc. This game shares some of those aspects with its more post-modern/sci-fi tactical style.\n\nI can't wait to see it grow more. The Starcrown Aerospace mission is a cool stealth-based one, which is demonstrating the versatility of the gameplay options. Right now it seems to focus on android murdering, but I would imagine in the near future they will start incorporating live missions where you are sent to fight real enemies. Also, I have notice some performance optimizations in the game.\n\nOriginal stuff:\n\nSo far this game seems to be going in a great direction. The ambitious developers have been updating in good iterations and the background is looking very excellent. This game is essentially a Science-Fiction FPS where you are a Marine that goes to.. space! Common theme right? Well, this game does it different. You aren't some Halo Spartan or Warhammer Space Marine. You aren't some overpowered super-armored exo-suit marine that has access to giant guns and can punch enemies through a wall. You are a ordinary soldier who is trained for elite operations in space and ground.\n\nThis game puts a nice emphasis on augmented reality technology, such as implementing a visor that indicates your objectives, ammo, used items, etc. This may compare to other Sci-fi Marine flicks, with the exception that it is in such a way where the technology IS apart of your helmet, and not some typical video game user interface. Take off the visor and you will notice there is nothing. No recticule, no ammo type, no indicators for equipment, no objective points, NOTHING. Just your gun and it's trustworthy Iron Sight.\n\nRight now as of Early Access, there are several features players can experience. While it isn't near to completion yet, it definately shows progress and I feel like these Developers are NOT out to dissapoint anyone. One thing I would like to see with this game is a little more of a team-based orientation when playing in competitive matches. It seems like no one really sticks as a team and it becomes a solo-festival of shooting. I don't have a big problem with it, but I have a problem if teamplay isn't encouraged.\n\nWhat really gets this game my thumbs up right now is the whole immersive experience. The Ambient sound effects while on board a space station with the lights out makes you feel like a real soldier sent to investigate a dead space station. The eerie sound of hostile robots and their locomotion has you glued to the iron sight to check all areas. The Helmet is on, the gun is loaded, the objectives are displayed and the flashlight is on. Ok, time to figure out how to proceed to the objective.\n\nThis game just seems so much in that realm, and I would love it to continue being so. I just hope not all the levels are going to consist of pitch-black environments with 100% flashlight usage. The game should demand all sorts of scenarios. I do like the darkness, but I want a balance of dark and light. Missions in places where facilities have power and missions where places have no power and it is dark. Balance is everything when it comes to mission consistency.\n\nThings I expect and would like when the game goes gold:\n\n1. Peak performance optimizations\n2. Plentiful amount of multiplayer and singleplayer missions.\n3. Adherence to realistic player movement and team-oriented gameplay.\n4. Adherence to that immersive charm that I mentioned.\n5. Variety of equipment and weapons.\n\nI have a great amount of enthusiasm for this game.

Most of the people that play this game are flashing their rank as if it is a real life military rank and they'll be sure to remind you of your playtime if you mention something that is not overly positive.\nStay far away from this game if you don't have friends to play it with; the existing community is cancer.\n\n\nOriginal topic below.\n\nI've liked this game for a while but i have to turn in a negative review sadly enough.\n\nThe game was very promising with unique HUD features, voice features and co-op features (♥♥♥♥ing shark monsters), and the gameplay is pretty nice overall.\n\nSadly the game falls flat as it has been in early access for almost 3 years now (even longer before it hit steam) and the developers have failed to deliver anything surprising ever since.\n\nI barely even know what they added, i only know they added in a SMG, silencers and maybe a map? (not sure).\nSo the HUD feature, being a helmet you can open at the cost of losing your HUD is pretty lame and useless, as it lacks a point of using it in the first place and isn't even shown on other players when they do it (laaaaaame).\nThere's also no immersive voice system in the game anymore, meaning you won't hear people use voice chat ingame with realistic echoing and objects hindering the sound.\n\nAs for the shark monsters; you're left with lame robots that run at you. Yeah..\n\nI may sound pessimistic here but in an early build they had all of these features were  in the game, sure probably not flawless but they were there, yet the developers decided it's more important to focus on cosmetic things and insignificant updates.\n\nAs for now it's a somewhat decent tactical shooter but it has no reason to keep playing, especially not considering the playerbase is pretty dead (no ♥♥♥♥ after 3 years of no special content). No campaign, no missions, no persistent rewards/stats, no nothing.\n\nBasically the development fell flat and you shouldn't expect this game to reach full release with expected content.","April 6","false","7.9"," 25 of 41 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","25","41","2","10"

I bought it during the 2014 year-end sale because I liked the concept of the game and I wanted to support the devs. However, since then, I have regretted my decision. Here are a few reasons why. (READ BELOW FOR UPDATED AND EDITED VERSION)\n\nOptimization.\nFace it, folks. This game is running on an outdated engine in desperate need of optimization. I can't even play the game because it constantly runs at 3 frames per second even with graphics settings turned all the way down. I simply do not understand this since my computer more than meets the minimum requirements of this game. I've seen many people facing the same issues, but although the devs have repeatedly promised to fix this, they haven't. And this brings us to...\n\nDevs.\nI know Zero Point Software is an indie company with a relatively small team and limited resources unlike larger AAA developers. However, I've done some research on the history of this game's development and simply put, I'm not impressed at all. So much has been promised by the developers, yet they have delivered little. Updates are few and far between, and each update doesn't add major content. I don't find anything in the game that is "revolutionary" and "advanced." There aren't even secondary weapons, and there are only two primary weapons. TWO FOR GOD'S SAKE. A campaign is said to be "in the works" but I doubt it would arrive in the next few years. Gameplay is so restricted and although the game is still in early access, keep in mind that it technically has been for nearly a decade. That fact alone should raise warning signals about the direction of this game. The devs keep deceiving the community with meaty chunks of new content that takes forever to be realized. And by "new content," I mean vital mechanics of any FPS game.\n\nAs I said, I love the concept of this game and I really want to support the devs, but at the rate at which this game is progressing, I would not recommend this game at all. Maybe once the full game is released in 2032, then I would turn the tables on my stand. Until then, not a chance.\n\nUPDATED VERSION:\n\nAfter getting a new custom gaming desktop, most of the lag issues were gone and I could now play the game at max settings really smoothly. However, while one problem was out of the way, another problem was presented and many of the old issues still haven't been resolved. I really wanted to play this game but the playerbase is so small that I had an extremely hard time looking for matches to participate in. And honestly, now that I could fully experience the gameplay, it's nothing revolutionary like what the devs claim it to be. Updates are still grinding along slowly and the game is almost the same as when I first got it. Yeah, there is Hell Week. But who really plays Hell Week? It only comes on certain timings and I'm not free to play during those timings. If Instellar Marines were a free-to-play game, I would probably give it a "meh" rating. But I paid spent $10 on this game during the Christmas sale when I could have gotten a much better game for the same price. In conclusion: go spend your money elsewhere. This is game is not worth paying any money for.","June 19, 2015","false","2.1"," 20 of 32 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","20","32","3","0"

I've waited quite a while for the developers to give the features that we were promised from the beginning (land sharks, co-op, etc) for about half a damn year. I thought they would add something to this game that would really just "This is unlike any other game because of this idea" and wow me. My god was I wrong. I have waited a long time to get my 15 dollars worth but all I get is this extremely clunky, limited, and coreless game that would pass for free as a browser game. The guns, or only gun, for that matter, flies upwards when you try your best to shoot forward making the simplest of shots nearly impossible. The maps are varied, but so dark, you can barely see anything you are shooting. There are no crosshairs, no crouching, no weapon variety, things that are standard of shooters. It is very difficult to find something good about this game at the moment unless you set your standards really low for this "alpha" title. I believed, but not anymore.

Most features are currently in development. Even though the sidebar states "Co-Op", that doesn't even exist in its current iteration. The Single-Player stated is being able to walk around maps. That is all.\n\nI think the term "Early Access" and "Alpha" in this case are an understatement. The game has 1 gun. The game does not have the RPG elements. The game has only recently implemented jumping after months in development. Look at the features listed as being IN the game. A flashlight. A visor. A laser-sight. Is that really enough to justify selling this game to customers?\n\nSome might like your hardcore shooters. But please. There are better ones out there that aren't of the quality you'd find in a web browser.\n\nEDIT: A developer responded (check the comments). Although I understand the game is in Early Access, and I have bought many games under that term. But to release a game with a concept spanning years ago in still a pre-alpha stage with many features missing is just.. Well, wrong.

Most of the Maps are your standard shooter stuff, But one sticks out. "Operations" This map goes through three modes: Normal,Alarm, and Darkness. it makes the battles fun and exciting. during the Alarm mode it is hard to aim because of all the noise and flashing lights while in darkness you can not see without using your light, and if you do you will be giving your enemies a clear pointer to where you are.\n\nAlthough it is fun to play the lack of any choice when it comes to guns,armor, even your avatar's look, makes the game get old very fast. There is rarely more than one server with players on it, and sometimes when the server reaches 16 players you wont be allowed in with the game saying "Error: Server is full" even thought the limit says 18. Hopefully when the game progresses more there will be more players.  The game sells for $14.99 USD. Unless you get the Spearhead version in which you get all "including all future updates and expansions". i dont understand that really, "All future updates?" you get the updates no matter what version you have... right?\n\nRight now the game is very limited you can't crouch, go prone or do anything other than sprint and walk really. Leveling up does nothing other than giving you a steam achievement,  However the Dev road map promises that and more, including O-Rift support and Linux ports.The Devs seem to be staying on top of things with updates and bug fixes, and they obliviously have big plans for their game.\nif you want to invest in a small game that may one day become the PC's Halo then checkout Interstellar Marines from Zeropoint Software on Steam.","March 7, 2014","true","5.4"," 61 of 110 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","61","110","0","0"

So far it doesn't seem legit, they barley release any updates and when they do they are extreamly small.

Be careful when buying early access games, when they release wait a while and see if you hear good reviews about them. If so and you think the game is interesting then it is your choice to buy it, just make sure you know what early access means for a game.\n\nI hope Interstellar Marines gets to the point where it is a full game, but it does not look like it so far.

The eight developers just don't seem as active as they should be for this early access game.\n(Edit) There are only eight devs, get that in your head.\n\nI say save your money for now.

There are several servers available, and it is of course best to chooze the one with the lowest ping. Despite intermittent lag problems the game is very intense and immersive. The graphics are well done and the play between light and shadow is fantastic. Best of all is the audio though, which really adds to the immersion. The teams consists of up to 8 players each, with usually quite varying skill and experience levels. The game is quite hard for all beginners, and can feel quite hopeless when starting as a fresh TR-0. But if you don't give  up, and maybe enjoy a little masochism, you will improve and start to dish it out yourself. Before you  know it (well... hundred hours or more later) you reach top level TR-100. Then it's your turn to dominate the fresh meat pouring in!","August 6, 2014","true","601.8"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Edited it to update some content that's in the game as of 6/3/15.\n\nInterstellar Marines is a game I've been following since 2008, it has been redone into the Unity engine and is constantly being updated. The community is fantastic, the dev team is really nice, and it is a overall positive environment. The game has a fun multiplayer component, an awesome lighting system, and has good balancing. The game also have a decent amount of maps that can change as the match progresses mostly by lighting, the atmosphere is very impressive and one of the best in MP FPS games. The game now has COOP with several modes in the game. The Terrorist Hunt-like mode Elimination, the Objective-based Survival, and Nucleus-exclusive Escape. There's also two Campaign maps (The Neurogen Incident and Assault on Starcrown Aerospace) including a tutorial for the game.\n\nThe bad: The game has only has two weapons, the framerate isn't that great unless you have a good processor, and content is bare bones.\n\nIf you expect a lot of stuff in this early version, you'll be disappointed. However, the game is decent enough to sink a lot of hours into it, and the community is remarkable.

The graphics are pretty good and gameplay is quite amazing and is VERY atmospheric with things like the day/night change even going completely dark in some cases, rain, and snow. There's fatigue and unsteady aim after sprinting, rain droplets and affects on your helmet. It's also pretty realistic on the realistic difficulty, a few hits and typically your dead or damn near it and so are the enemies(minus the bosses of course).

At this point there are two single player missions (up to 4 players can complete them), a couple of levels for a team of 4 players (designated as coop missions) and some more stages for those eager to play with even more players (multiplayer missions).\n\nWhen not playing against each other you play against robots. With the submachine gun they handle they look like T-800s straight out of the Terminator franchise. Some prefer melee to shooting - on greater difficulties it is easier to die but your friends can revive you.\n\nLevel design is excellent and the environment changes constantly: changes in the weather affect visibility; suddenly it is nighttime and only your flashlight helps you but then it also reveals your position. At night light poles can aid you or if it is raining the sudden lightning can help you to eliminate your foes.\n\nInterestingly, you only have two rifles available. One is intended to help you with targets in greater distance; both can be equipped with a suppressor and laser sight. At this point they serve their purpose but perhaps a melee weapon could be nice.\n\nAs for graphics: the good old Unity engine delivers. Lighting effects are great - with the quick steps of the approaching robots you are in for a treat due to the excellent atmosphere. In fact, the single player mission revolving around an accident can certainly give you the creeps!\n\nInterstellar proves we have to look out for independent video game developers! I am happy to recommend this game - especially now (February 11th, 2015) when it is free to play till next week.","February 12, 2015","true","4.6"," 20 of 33 people (61%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","61","20","33","5","0"

I'm glad to see that they are finally releasing content more readily - almost want to change to a positive review just for that.  However, I still stick by most of the thoughts from the original review.  This game is still only a game "with potential" - currently 2 guns and a handful single/multiplayer maps large aspects of the game that is promised are missing and those are the elements that will really set this game apart from a standard FPS.  On a positive note the game LOOKS and sounds amazing and I like that I can see some of the elements starting to come into play such as ranks.  Also I feel a lot better about the state of the game since I have seen updates much more steadily.  Sadly, RIGHT NOW this game feels very shallow and offers nothing unique.  I'm not trying to knock the game too much in early access but I'm just warning for people that a lot of the core elements outline for what this game is meant to be don't seem to be coming in the near future.  I look forward to the day when this game offers something that really grabs me and brings me because I really want to like it, the game just can't hold me for more than 10-20 minutes per session because it feels so flat and uninspired.\n\n---\n\nGame development is just taking far too long.  It seems that the focus has been big time on graphics and little else.  So if they can apply the level of quality in their lighting effects to ANYTHING else in the game at some point it has a lot of promise, but after a few years I just don't see it coming.  It feels like a blizzard game, lot of time put into something that in the end is "Okay" and you're left wondering why it took so long for THAT.\n\nThere are a lot of game elements missing and I'm not exactly sure why.  Right now you are greeted the same basic things you can find in standard dev kits.  The pure lack of simple features after years of development leads me to believe that this is taking a back burner to something else.  You should be alarmed that they make a big deal about adding in basic things and it just makes me fear how long it will take to implement all that they are setting out to implement (non-linear play, RPG-style character growth, Story) when they can't even implent sprint or a few weapons after years of development.\n\nJust grab it when it comes out (if ever) or when it gets closer to completion, you won't be missing anything.  They take so long to do anything the "future expansions" you're guranteed with preorder will probably never exist or will take so long you'll have moved on to something else.","July 31, 2014","false","1.6"," 20 of 33 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","20","33","0","0"

It went on about 8 months ago with a promising piece of PR Art that sugested a faily advanced point of development and actual skill. What got me was the promise: get it now, it will never be that cheap again. None of this was real and it went 66 % off twice. Some of the devs or friends of em are even giving away free copys. Though in EARLY development nothing that is not trivial like a new slider in the options menu developed over the course of about 8 months. HANDS OFF! till they get a finished Product done...  THERE ARE NO SPACE SHARKS.... 3 (now 5) "maps" mp shooter  with precise aiming... no cover system... no tactic elements no nothing... oh.. you can open your helmet... does the sound still get wonky if you do that?... a TECH DEMO at BEST... I feel like I supported lazyness and a big a** office.... Steam is a market place, no kickstarter campaign. I wanna buy games, not potential.\n\nTo the Dev response:\nMaybe, they should not accuse people of not getting the early access concept. That's flat out offensive AND shaming, when the results clearly show WHO's not getting it! Since the release of Natural Selection 2 for instance UnknownWorldsEntertainment (5 people) released several updates a week (later less frequently "only" thrice a month) for free. Serious contend and balance updates with all new features, Engine performance workovers, models, animations and Maps tewaks. Till only one year later the game was finished and had changed its face several times for the good and had 2 completley free expansion Packs. And you wanna tell me your skill and know how can compete with that? Please stop the hair splitting and convincing of dumb people!.. we are NOT!\n\nAnd where did all the money go? Do you need all of it to implement a points system worth mabye 50 lines of code? Did you hire people who actually are up to it. Cuz' lets face it you worked out an engine. There are NO gameplay elements exept for the Doom 2 MP..... YET...... sure.. insert random promise here.\n\nTILL YOU GET IT RIGHT....

You can refund me and when the game is finished I will buy it AND take everything back... I promise!\n\nPS: I should compare the PR work with the actual game on youTube.

Kime Jr.","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198012461471/","107 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSo far, from what I've played of Interstellar Marines, I have to say I'm not 100% impressed. While I'm aware it's a game in Alpha development the problems which are presented are fundemental things, mechanics and such, which maybe the developers will see from this review.\n\nLet's get the ball rolling!\n\nFirst off the bat, there are only three weapons available at present, which to be frank isn't what you'd expect from a future combat simulator. All guns feel pretty much the same the only thing that really differs is one is single shot, one has a scope but less rounds and one has more rounds and is your all round most used gun. Gun sounds are alright, but again there doesn't seem to be  much difference between all of them. The laser sight is a bit weird on all of them, helps a little when shooting from the hip, but if your shooting from the hip you aint gonna hit much anyway. For some reason when you shine the lasersight at plants it acts like a flashlight on the plant as well which is equally as wierd.\n\nMaps are, at best... generic, no real detail, lots of spamming of textures, think planetside two but on a reasonable quality that the normal man can run on his PC. Buildings have collision flaws, so you can look into the world at points, where as at others you cant shoot round a corner because an invisible bit of wall is blocking you leaving floating bullet holes. The lighting system is really quite awful, sometimes you can shoo a light out in one shot, some times in three clips, it depends on how stroppy the light is. All lights seem to go through walls which is really bad considering we're no longer in 2005, and when a ligh in a bathroom is seeping out onto the outside decking that's just not cool.\n\nMost of your time will be in Single player as for some reason or another I still can't access multiplayer, servers won't refresh, which either suggests a bug or that no servers are up which is a bad thing seeing as the game is being sold as co-op and multiplayer. Single player is pretty dull for the most part, you're AI guide's voice is generic robot and just gives you a headache after a while, it also tries to crack some sarcastic jokes which doesn't make any sense as the rest of the time it's trying to be serious, Sometimes there are also some random adjectives thrown into it's vocalbulary because why not.\n\nMost missions are training missions, the one's that actually seem like real assignments are also training missions, but the descrptions don't include that, and you'll be fighting one of two bot variants, one's with guns and flailing shop dummys. One mission can't be completed because the elevator at the end kills the player, and on the same mission they throw in some audio logs which are about the most immersing thing into the universe and even they seem a bit strained.\n\nThe Robot AI is some sort of horrible combination of skyrim's stealth detection and Deus Ex's: Invisible war. In short terrible. You're given which difficulties you'd like from easy, normal, hard, and "relaistic" (Which just means more bots, who can one shot you with some sort of taser you don't seem to be allowed to use). The stealth system is a fraud, you can shoot lights out and hide in the shadows, but this just means it takes bots a few seconds longer to see you, if you shoot a bot even with one of the weapons silencers from some 100 metres away another bot will spawn, will run or walk to where the other one was, find you and kill you. f you don't of course plug him full of some lead.\n\nI basically have mastered speed running the maps, you can use stealth or you can just memorise what spawns where, and go in full guns blazing, which works pretty succesfully if you don't panick.\n\nIn short. 5/10 currently, with improvements could push a 6-8/10 depending on if they start working on new enemy models, multiplayer that works (I've seen none of it) more weapons, grenades, better stealh, lighting and more varied maps and by that I mean maps where metalic grey isn't the colour of every man made surface.\n\nBuy it at your own risk, I wouldn't personally reccomend it currently, I think it would have been a better option to release this fully devloped, because personally I coulda waited for the actual release. But hey maybe the devs will turn it around, I'm aware it's meant to be artificial environments and a training simulator but I've seen laser tag places cooler than this.\n\nI think I'll edit this in a year's time or so and see if anything changes.\n\n","September 27, 2015","false","11.0"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","14","22","0","0"

It has a ton potential, I'm confident that the game will be good, since it was in development since 2005. Uh on second thought, maybe games with long devs time don't ALWAYS turn out well. *Looks at Colonial Marines* Err-uh anyways. I'm sure this'll turn out just fine. (please forgive me for mentioning that)\n\nThe singleplayer/co-op missions are atmospheric, which I absolutely love. It's like both System Shock games, the movie Aliens, and Doom 3 had a baby. (With Alien/Aliens mainly being the inspiration for any sci-fi horror game). Your eyes and ears (mainly your ears) are the only friends you'll have in those missions. As to who or what you're fighting in the missions, well you'll have to figure that out for yourself.\n\nThe multiplayer is interesting, well. The maps are, for the most part. I love how they have day to night transitions, and weather effects. Not many games have that anymore. I like how it encourages stealth, and team work, I've been playing nothing but Conquest. And I have to say, being the last one alive and having to capture a point, (or waiting out their respawn timer) to bring back members in your team can be pretty exhilerating.\n\nI like what I see.

In early access you take on the role of a special forces soldier training at an underground interplanetary treaty organization (ITO) Facility. The game is currently centered around multiplayer. Where you as the special forces soldier train in a variety of specialized environments. All multiplayer maps feature a unique set of dynamic lighting and elements which really set this game apart from other FPS. The level and map design is "AAA" quality, the level designs allow multiple entry ways into most access points and areas allowing for Tactical game-play, and greatly rewarding players who are able to effectively communicate. The game features a distinctive active HUD, which when shot can be disabled adding another level of immersion into the world.\n\nFor a game that is in early access, it is incredibly polished, with very few bugs and glitches. The game has a very active community. The community Managers are online, on the forums daily, and will even stop by from time to time to play a round with you.\n\nOverall I highly recommend this game anyone who enjoys FPS. It is exceptionally well made for a game in early access, fun, and has a great community to be a part of. The game is getting better, and better with every update, and continues to become more tactical and immersive every patch.","March 30, 2014","true","101.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The multiplayer leaves much more to be desired, and unfortunately limits the player to only one class, and one weapon being an SMG; which has to be your close-quarters weapon, sniper rifle, assualt rifle, and secondary weapon. The only way to "rank-up" and I use this term lightly here, is to kill openents by shooting them in the head (as body shots do not count towards the enemy being hit); which makes me much rather just want to play Halo's SWAT game mode. Even though the objective of the game is to get your openents ticket count to zero by dominating a controlled area; this can be done much more quickly by just killing openents (and is a lot more lucrative too, seeing as how dominating the control area doesn't help you "rank up" at all).\n\nThere are a few cool mechanics such as the ever changing environments; and the abillity to shoot out lights in the area forcing your openents to fight in the dark; which could either help or hurt you depending in the situation. Overall, it just makes me want more out of it; but it's definitely worth keeping an eye on, as there is major potential.","April 1, 2014","true","1.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Like, you cant find a more addicting tactical shooter. The game perfectly balances teamwork and the ability to understand the battlefield like the back of your hand. The need for taking the time and predicting the enemy will trump any twitch shooting skills. The game does a great job of utilizing this.\n\nThe co-op is hard, but if you can get 3 of your friends to do it with you, you wont even notice the amount of times you die it'll be so fun XD\n\nThe aim relies on your patience after Update 17. This means that it is virtually impossible to shoot lethally while running. If you take the time to stop and aim, your shots will become 100% more deadly in my opinion. (Thats a lot!)\n\nTo play to the best of your ability, teamwork is required. All. The. Time.\nWithout your teammates, the best you can do is get one back. There is no lone wolf in this game. Take it from me, ive tried, its not possible in any form XD\n\n\nThe community in this game is the best youll ever see. I challenge you to find a better one.

Nothing the trailer or description promises is actually in the game. I get that this is early access, thus an alpha, but alpha state means the basics are basically implemented albeit in an unpolished and buggy state.\nYou can't promise a "4 player co-op tactical FPS" inspired by Rainbow Six, when all you get is 8 servers with random team deathmatch, featuring gameplay that would be archaic even by the standards we had 10 years ago.\nIf you buy this now, this is what you get:\nA space marine with sluggish controls (you walk very slow, sprint barely changes speed) ONE weapon and useless features like being able to open your helmet. Multiplayer consists of very basic team deathmatch (good luck finding a non-full server though, there's only 8 of them) that feels very uncomfortable due to the aforementioned controls, which are so archaic, especially for a supposedly "tactical FPS", that it feels like a joke. Quake did control better than this. Seriously, after multiple updates you are now able to jump (meaning, you press space and then akwardly hop a little bit, after a short delay). What's more, you can't lean to the left/right to peek around corners and you're unable to crouch. In a tactical FPS. It's ridiculous.\nAnd don't talk to me about "it's early access, bla, bla", we're talking about basic, most fundamental things missing that really undermines my trust i have in the developer.\nOther critics meantioned the fair and balanced maps and online gameplay. Seriously? I just joined a server in which i killed ONE dude and then subsequently got killed as soon as i spawned. The top player in my team? 43 kills. The top players of the enemy team? 389 and 346 kills respectively.\nDon't buy it, it's not worth 5 bucks (it's on sale right now) and i'm very doubtful now that this will ever be something akin to a finished game (another critic mentioned that this game is in development since 2009).","January 1, 2014","false","0.9"," 42 of 76 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","42","76","0","4"

The concept is pretty fresh; think Rainbow Six, System Shock 2 and Half Life in a blender. The dev team is small, but growing. It is in early access currently so it is in a pre alpha state. It is limited to VERY simple mechanics and multiplayer at the moment, but is updated and improved upon on a regular basis. The team plans on implementing all those fps basics and more in the near future. In all honesty I've had more fun with this than any other complete and big budget multiplayer fps.\n\nI have had a blast so far playin in the community gatherings and interacting with the ZPS guys.\nThey are patient, friendly and listen to fan feedback. They genuinely want to make an amazing game. The potential is limitless if they keep getting the support they deserve. It is wise to jump in while you can get it for such a decent price.

It has some performance issues, hopefully Unity will make it runs smoother, but it's a really good game. In this state it hasn't much to offer, but the developers are working on the game all day and night. It has a very good feature, which I've never seen before, you can make a trip on the maps, and test some lighting effects, and enviroment types. It's a pretty cool feature, but like DayZ it hasn't much to offer. You can play multiplayer, which is crazy good: No name tags, no minimap, and team kill is ON! IF you want to take a look at the gameplay elements head over interstellarmarines.com/game, and try out 2 prototypes for FREE! You just have to register an account and play. It's the only Single Player mode in the whole game, but the game doesn't contains them. Anyway: Interstellar Marines is a good game, but if you want a full game ( or doesn't understand what Early Access means ), then don't buy it yet.

No I don't have 800 hours playing it but I don't need that many to see that the Devs have lost their original sight for this game. The initial video they put out laid out a basic "train of thought" and that was that they wanted to create a Tactical FPS based on their past experiences in games like RB6. The said they wanted it to be a slow methodical FPS in space. Now with that being said, I saw them completely turn from that to a RnG style shooter which other than the polish, differs in no way shape or form from CoD, CS or any other number of titles. I loved the vision and I loved the Idea but I also sort of knew that this would happen because It's a small niche to work in. Soooo many people play ADD/ADHD style games these days. It's hard to fathom that people who actually like slow, methodical, deliberate movements, tactical pausing and even a bit of camping for survival sake, bleed damage one or two shot kills and team survival style play only nume in the single digit percentile of FPS players today. Sooo It's easy to see how a smaller company can lose sight of its intentions and jump into the race that they were trying to avoid in the first place. It doesn't make it any easier for a player such as me who was hoping that they wouldn't but hey, we live and learn.","August 10, 2015","false","22.9"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","10","15","0","0"

The single player AI doesnt need light though, because combat drones can smell you through walls apparently. The singleplayer is a nightmare to play, combat drones spot you instantly regardless of crouch, flashligh, or laser. and they hit every single shot, most times I got detected I died immediately as soon as I rounded a corner that was black as night.

Their are also 1 or 2 COOP missions and a game mode where you fight against bots.\n\nThink CSGO but with better maps, the maps are very good and have bushes and grass to hide in, the maps change as the game goes on (day, night, snow, rain, mist etc.). Even from South Africa and a ping of 200+ I had a lot of fun (ping doesn't mean much if you can hide in a bush and shoot a guy from behind, hope the make a small RSA server... please? please!).\n\n2) Excellent community, none toxic people that report bugs and make jokes, 2nd to none.\n\n3) Okay Graphics (COD level I would say, not BF level but acceptable), yes the graphics still overuse resources but my old GTX 660 OC does fine on highest @ 1080 and a 750ti will also. No need for a $300+ GPU.\n\n4) Best sounds ever, even BF3 falls behind on sound.\n\n5) Cheap, <$20 for a game that gives a lot of value and fun.\n\nIf you Like the good old shooters (like Rainbow 6 and Ghost Recon originals) this is for you, you do regain health as far as I remember but it is basically 1 shot 1 kill. Tactics like not capping a point and shooting guys as they try and cap it are a must, teams of two also help (usually I get shot and my friendly then cleans up the enemy, as I say my ping is bad).\n\nHOWEVER SOME OF THE CRITICAL POINTS ARE TRUE:\n\n1) Original backers will be sour that they have had to wait years, I don't blame them or the devs as the game simply didn't get enough support from the FPS crowd.\n2) 2 Guns only, this is fine as the gameplay is basically 2 body or 1 head shot however more weapons are about to be released soon from what I have heard.\n3) The game is early access and their are a few bugs (far less then some post releases) and A LOT of content is coming (not a bad thing is it?).\n\nJUST BUY IT, IT Won't GO BANKRUPT AGAIN IF PEOPLE SUPPORT IT AND IT IS A GREAT GAME!","June 3, 2015","true","8.7"," 71 of 132 people (54%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","54","71","132","9","0"

So best of luck!\n\nGave it a shot as it's free for a week which is a nice gesture from the developers. I'm afraid I'm not hugely impressed in it's current playable state particulary after reading the history of the developement which spans a number of years and this is the result. You can certainly see the potential building blocks of a decent game and it promises some ambitious features  (90% of these aren't in the game yet) but ultimately it's a forgettable gaming experience right now and one must assume being developed partime due to the slow updates.\n\nI'd probably be a bit more forgiving if there were some especially original elements in this early version that gave it a wow factor of things to come. There aren't, and remains just a list of awesome ideas/plans. In it's current state the level designs feel quite average and lacks any convincing sense of impact when you shoot the enemy. Nothing in the game right now resembles anything that it promises, and that's a bit worrying. I'm not sure the developers have the ability to create that game.\n\nI have a real bad feeling this is going to be a game that's never going to be fully completed and the current heavily discounted price drop and extended free play is a cash grab from the developers in final effort to raise some quick cash to continue the development work. I doubt it will raise the money they need so I'm not going to invest even the paltry sum of under a fiver that's currently available for.

The problem with this game is that there really isn't much progress since the game first showed up on Steam. A pvp multiplayer that has like a whole 20 people on at any given time, a coop mode that I haven't seen anyone playing, and of course the single-player. PVP comes in 2 flavors: 1) Everybody is hiding in a corner 2) Everybody is running around frantically shooting their smg's at the first person they see. Coop and singleplayer are completely interchangable experiences.

It's still in early acces... (you probably know what I'm talking about).\n\nThe Devs seem motivated and active (regular updates) but the game is going anywhere, it feels like nothing has changed in the two years I own the game already. Any other Dev would have already abandoned this, and for a reason. Their idea of creating a AAA-Indie failed obviously. They overdid themselves, and they are still beating this dead horse. It's sad to see what happened to their idea, and how they are using a lot of energy towards this.\n\nTo come to the things I like about the game:\n-Active devs\n-Decent community (not too friendly, not to toxic either)\n-Different ways to approach an objective\n-Multiplayer, campaigne and co-op\n-Some attachments (silencer, flashlight and laser pointer)\n-A tutorial\n\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n-3 weapons (where one isn't even implemented in the tutorial yet, also not having the silencer attachment)\n-Forced fire mode (two are auto)\n-Overwhelming kick (recoil). This might be interesting, but it just throws me off too much, I can't hit the direction I was aiming at after 3 shots.\n-Limited number of maps\n-One sort of enemy (robots)\n-Same spawnpoint (or at least no great varity)\n-Hardcore multiplayer, you will get stomped\n-Outdated graphics (due to the time of development)\n-Ai..Need i say more... Pretty much the worst I encountered\n-Repetive as f***, going hand in hand with the limited map pool\n-Same controles as every FPS (no leaning etc.), making it not as tactical as it could be\n-Buggy (getting stuck in wall, running in straight lines without pushing the buttons etc.) (may be fixed)\n-Laggy! When I started playing, I had no problem. Now, I can barely shoot without crazy lag spikes (playing on a Macbook Pro mid 2013 though)\n\n\nI would have loved to see this become an amazing game. The idea is fantastic. However, other games outplayed them (Insurgency). The game is simply a Zombie, not alive, but also not able to die. It has a rotten body, but the heart is gold.\nIn the state I started playing it, i would have said: Yeah, get it on sale, give it a try. I had some fun playing the co-op, however, after the 2nd playtrough I could solo the mission because i knew where what was and where the enemies spawned.\nNow, I say: Don't buy it, it isn't worth it.

However dispite this I thoroughly enjoy playing this game. I find it reminds me of my days played Halo:CE where you could just spawn in and play instead of haveing to bother with loadouts and perks which many games today do. In short I like it's simplicity. Servers are quiet and you'll have to try and play at peak times or organise a group of friends. If you enjoy a simple to join game with friends then this is your game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TjM/recommended/236370/","TjM","╭Soli","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TjM/","181 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI'm confused.\nThe atmosphere of this game provides some level of stealth, some level of close-encounters jump scares due to the general darkness which seems to haunt every single level in this game. But that's pretty much it.\n\nI'm confused. What's special about this game?Interstellar Marines seem to be doing the exact same thing any other FPS on the market does, only with the exclusion of any natural light sources. That's pretty much it. Every map is dark, and you walk up to someone and shoot them in the face while spraying.\nIs this the selling point? Dark maps? That's it? Seriously, I'm lost.\n\nBefore any of ye wail : "But it's just in alpha!! Give it some time!"\nFrom what I experienced, the game seems to have its gameplay in order, its roots can hardly change any more than Evolve could've changed while it was in "Alpha". All it lacks is some additional content -- but all it means is that what you're looking at is Counter Strike with some extra flavor, or even a Call of Duty in perpetual darkness with no other selling point. Interstellar Marines, as much as I experienced -- is your generic shooter....In space. That's it.\n\nUpdate:Other than my disbelief that there's any actual gameplay (spray-and-pray), I find the free week long trial to be a marketting blunder, who thought a "pre-alpha" game is a good demo? Heck, even when stepping into the tutorial of the game, it never does anything to tell you how Interstellar Marines is in any shape or form unique or interesting. You walk around, you shoot stuff for no reason, the end.\n\nI was informed they essentially want to create a form of a Rainbow-Six tactical-shooter, but when you finish the tutorial, or when you even finish a multiplayer session....You get absolutely 0% Rainbow 6. You are only welcomed by a "The Swapper" atmosphere, which is pleasant, and, sadly, some mindless bot killing. You do nothing but blindly walk around in a poorly lit series of rooms, and spray anyone you can see.\nThat's it.\n\nThe game, upfront, tells you its current vision : "Nothing".\nI don't buy the "pre-alpha" monotony, the game's design is too polished, too satisfying. They clearly thought that'd gain them more sales if the game was an eye-candy, but sadly -- they neglected how the game works, how the game plays out -- and currently, and most likely for the very distant future -- it will not be anything like Rainbow-Six in space. I cannot be anything but cynical regarding the development of this game. If they do manage to pull their vision off, whatever it is, good for them, really. But I fear that might be some time in 2018.\n\nTLDR: The CORE OF THE GAME does not exist. Whatever it is they have envisioned, it does not currently exist. After 2-3 years, they have nothing to show for. What were they doing all that time? They sure boast their dynamic-lightning system, but where's the actual game?\n\nI seriously think someone up on advertising and marketting thought he was being clever for coming up with this week-long thing, what a rubbish idea. It only demotivated me from buying this game. For shame.","February 10, 2015","false","0.6"," 191 of 364 people (52%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","52","191","364","23","44"

I played this game. Blasted through a couple of single player missions, cried my way through some Co-op missions due to the lack of stealth ability and it just became a co-op run and gun, then raged my way through multiplayer when i realised i was playing a mix between a CoD (spray and pray) AvP2 (excessive use of darkness) Battlefield (Conquest like map) mash up. Quite frankly. Alpha or not. unless they DRASTICALLY change this game. It's horrible. The movement feels like your on ice all the time, Frame rates are all over the shop 20ish-150, the whole game feels washed out due to lack of colour or too much of the same colour. all in all i don't know why this game is so special.

I usually do not spend my hard earned money on anything that is less than complete.  Heck, I had never even heard of it before.  The trailer hooked me and the price was right.  I checked out the game for about an hour and enjoyed myself. The dynamic changes to the map environments is brilliant.  One moment the map is at night then changes to day and then dusk and then night...like a real training simulator. The game as is now is deffinately EARLY ACCESS...meaning not much in the way of bells and whistles.  So far they only have one type of multiplayer (a domination) and one usable weapon.  They do have several maps to play on though.\nIt is not the actual game that amazes me, it is their plans for the future.  After looking in to Zero Point alittle (love thier company motto) and what they have planned for IM. I "upgraded" to Spearhead Edition, not for the perks, but to show my support in them and their dream.  If they deliver, there will be a truly amazing game on the market.

Now truthfully the idea of what this game is and what its being shaped to become is going to be awesome and i totally love it but right now there's various problems that are supposed to make the games graphics and designs more "realistic" but some of these have gone to far, for example the shadows and the trees swaying in the wind these are all great small touches in the game that all games should have but the lag for my laptop is UNBEARABLE even games with 40+ players for me lag alot less, I think truthfully that these are good implements the game should have but you need to fix the framerate or at least find ways to greatly reduce graphics such as reducing shadows to a bear minimum or canceling moving decorations. Next is the rankings, So far i have played quite some matches and theres always one guy whos rank "TR" 30 or 40 who has me and all my teammates on the ground before we even see him walk in the room, There needs to be an evening out rank system because either this guy has some OP gun or he's just way to skilled for new players like me trying to actually understand the game. Anyway these are just major things that need to be fixed to make the game welcoming to new players and let them have some even fun matches.

Every detail is meant to immerse you in the game, and manages to succeed.  I found myself playing with even smaller features simply because I could.  Nice graphics, good sound, especially for early access, and interesting maps.  I especially like the domination game mode, which smaller scale shooters don't see enough of in my opinion.\n\nThat said, netcode sucks and you'll die to lag (yes, lag, not lack of skill) a lot more than you should.  Some encounters turn into hilarious spray-and-pray competitions to see who can reload faster and shoot near (not at) the enemy more.  As of update 14, this doesn't seem to be an issue as much, but reviving can be laggy.\n\nIn Update 11, the addition of an assault rifle is great.  The rifle could definitely use some more ammo and an updated scope, but the general feel is fun.  There is also a new game mode, which needs some tuning but is, overall, quite fun.\n\nUPDATE 14:  Wow this game has progressed.

I had the pleasure of having this gifted to me, and it is easily one of my more favorite early access games, and also a powerful FPS experience.\n\nThe aesthetics are awesome! The detail in the environment and two gun models is very good. The music and sounds are good - hearing bullets flying near and around you creates an extremely intense experience. One of the best features of this game, however, is the dynamic lighting effects.\n\nDuring gameplay, the enviroment will change - in some levels, there will be an increase/decrease of elevation in certain areas of the game (allowing for sudden height advantages/disadvantages if you are in the right/wrong place at the right/wrong time). Even more impressively, the light will switch between day/night-time cycles. During night, you can barely see directly in front of you - and using a flashlight and/or laser pointer for too long may give away your position. Stalking your target, hiding, then killing them when the lights come back on is so gratifying! Different levels also have red warning lights flaring during the night-time cycle, and this helps a little bit with visibility. So far, I have not come across any other game with lighting effects on par with Interstellar Marines.\n\nThe controls are typical of an FPS and easy to familiarize yourself with. The tutorials are provided in short, informative videos provided within the game. The learning curve is minimal to moderate (and actually, to challenging) depending on your experience with the FPS genre. Now, I pride myself at being fairly strong in most competitive shooters, be it first- or third-person; however, I had a rude awakening when I first tried Interstellar Marines. The gameplay is so intense and cutthroat - you die very quickly (which I love), and it took me a few game sessions to find my bearings.\n\nAnother thing I love about this game is how your heads-up display (HUD) will turn off when you are near death. Considering that friendly fire is always on, it can make firefights very interesting if you cannot remember where your allies and enemies are. You can open your helmet, however, I do not really see a point of doing this (for now). There also is no melee at the time of writing this review.\n\nThe two weapons you have available is a close-to-medium-ranged submachine gun, as well as a longer-ranged assault rifle. There are no grenades to use. You can crouch, but not go prone, and sprint is already one (you can toggle it off). I am unsure if there is going to be a stamina mechanic, however, as of now, I think you can sprint indefinitely.\n\nOverall, if you are an FPS buff, you MUST try this game. You will not regret it.\n\nDefinitely recommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews","September 28, 2014","true","2.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","1"

Consider it's still in alpha, the gameplay it does deliver is fluid, fast paced and to be honest, I don't see anything like it around. The maps are highly developed with a high level of attention to detail, and perform in game perfectly. The two weapons available are both balanced and have their ideal situations. Of course the game being in alpha has a few issues, the main one being lack of optimisation for computers. I will give a warning that people with non-specialised computers (i.e. computers not built for gaming) will find the experience unnattractive due to low framerates and latency, so waiting for future updates would probably be best. One point however, it would be appreciated if you could have more than 6 (or however many there are) graphics settings. However, they have been promised in future updates.\n\nAll in all, I could not reccomend this game anymore. Besides, for the maximum price of £13.99 it's a worthy investment to a game that in time, could rival most of the AAA FPS's out there.\n\n","May 31, 2014","true","20.2"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

When you first play this game, you probably will get slaughtered all the time, but practice makes perfect. At the time of writing this the game does not have many features or gamemodes but the devs have been hard at work making the game we know and love today. If you don't like it now, give it a year or two and then come back, it should be way better then :)\n\n9/10","October 23, 2014","true","61.9"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Since I purchased the game in 2013 they have made tremendous leaps and bound in it's development. Buy the game now while it's cheap and give the devs some well earned funds so that you dont have to buy it later when all your friends are raving about it and the game is higher priced.","January 13, 2015","true","3.1"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","9","14","2","0"

Each level design is made to have you gripped to your console, after playing a couple of levels I noticed a slight pain in my right arm, FROM GRIPPING THE MOUSE TOO HARD !!! These levels are intense, the design is breathtaking and although it's per-release I would still recommend you and a few friends playing multiplayer for a couple of hours and I bet 20,000 zorks you will be hooked.\n\nMoving on to actual game play, it's about as real life as you can get (without getting shot ofc) in Pre-release we only have the smg, which is fine I would like to get a hand on a rifle or frag grenade but I'm sure it will come in good time, when it's ready and not before. Dealing with the smg is a lot different than every other fps I've seen (which isn't everyone, but a few)\nSo lets say you spot a shadow in the dark of night, and you pump a few rounds into it getting your first kill of the evening, you'll notice the guns aim doesn't reset to center, oh no it stays in the last place you fired it, until you aim somewhere else, I have to say I love this feature, it's about as close real as real gets, absolutely no easy aiming.\n\nEverything must be done intentionally and with extreme malice, which will quickly sort out the pro's from the novices in no time. We have yet to see some kind of ranking system, to allow for the learning curb in this game, every at the moment gets mashed together and the best team wins. But I guess right now Zero Point Software is working on game play over ranking mechanics at the moment, but don't worry we already know this game is going to be amazing to play, casual, competitive or solo, so I don't think anyone cares about mechanics just yet. (but I'm sure it's on the list)\nStamina and exhaustion, keeping a good balance seems to be the key here, when your exhausted you can't really aim correctly or sprint... or jump very high, and recovery time can be an issue if you run into a building full of the enemy team, in the dark.... to afraid to turn on your flashlight in case you get spotted ! (would love to see some thermal imaging, though perhaps only heat signatures and not obstacles to allow some fairness also.)\n\nSo for right now I sprint for short bursts at a time, not allowing exhaustion to overcome me, (You don't really get feeling of moving fast when you sprint, perhaps some blurred edges and slightly increasing the speed of your sprint would help make it feel like your character is moving faster)\n\nWeapons - SMG at the moment, and it acts and feels like a SMG should, good work on that, and I hope to see as much thought and detail in the rest of the weapons once they are released.\n\nSolo content - Looking forward to it, and I hope it has as much diversity as ME3 when it comes to missions, non liner progression, pick-ups and power ups, and perhaps even a squad selection window even more immersion.\n\nOverall it looks amazing, feels great, plays well and can still make your heart jump or skip a beat when it gets very intense, recommended to all players who love realism and high detail, and with upcoming releases and updates this game is going to be one game you just can't put down.\n\nGreat work so far ZeroPoint,","February 2, 2014","true","17.2"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

The maps are challenging and allow for a tactical approach.  The AI are stupid enough to boost ones ego but smart enough to continue playing against them. The AI difficulty is adjustable so once a player gets used to the game mechanics, he/she can crank up the difficulty. Weapon variety and ballistics just feel right. Multiple game modes and maps keep the game interesting and the sound of a 600lb robot running at you will get the adrenaline pumping.

While it's visually spectacular and deserves some slack for the fact that it's still not complete, it does not have any partically unique nor remarkable gameplay aspects. They've said it themselves: it is an overly ambitious, wannabe sci-fi experience that is trying to fit in with the quality of popular shooters such as Half-Life and Doom. The problem is, however, instead of offering any new or simple themes to the gameplay, this game clones the gameplay of your average online shooter. For an indie game to become successful (like Minecraft, Fez or Amnesia) it has to introduce new gameplay features that dramatically change the experience in its genre. Interstellar Marines tries to do this but only manages to create minor enhancements to the gameplay such as 'lifting up your helmet' or 'not being able to figure out who is and isn't your teammate after you've been shot too much'. One feature, however, that I really enjoyed on a few of the maps is the variation of brightness or conditions (such as weather and fog) on the maps. On some of the maps this can be quite annoying, but on others this really helps create a genuine atmosphere and truly immerses you in the gameplay.\nThe best I can say is that you're guaranteed some fun playing some of the brilliantly designed maps and immersing yourself in the impressive graphics and typical FPS mechanics. I'm also looking forward to seeing how they eventually execute the single player gameplay.\nUnfortunately though, if this game is trying to rival other Sci-Fi shooters, it has a long way to go. Simple aspects that are essential for creating immersive and strategic gameplay such as crouching, meleeing or throwing grenades still haven't been added to the experience, and this must be included in the SOONEST UPDATE POSSIBLE. Furthermore, in the eventual finished product, I would expect to see some real, brand new ways to play the game that we've never seen before, especially considering the goals it is trying to achieve. IF YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE THE BEST GAME POSSIBLE, DO SOMETHING ORIGINAL OTHERWISE THERE'S NO POINT.\nHopefully we'll eventually see this game in a much better quality than it is at the moment, but for now I simply can't recommend it to anyone until there's a large increase in overall content.","January 24, 2014","false","2.2"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","12","20","0","0"

Several years ago they had a promotion for people who spent a certain amount of money to obtain "stock" in the company. I was one of those people. (I had to sign paperwork and mail it to them.)\n\nThis was all before it was ever greenlit on steam. Now, a lot of people say that it's slow or it won't be finished. Most people compare a small time-frame of from EA release until now, or an even shorter time-frame of "Free Week" until now. What I compare is literally from the time I invested in it, it was a browser-based unity engine, without an actual "client" to now.\n\nThen, it had a few things to play around with, empty maps to explore, the visor, changing weather/day-night cycles, etc. Now it has multiplayer, coop, an emerging "campaign," and even some fun little things to find in some of the maps. (Personally found one of the shark models and took a screen-shot of it.)\n\nWhile a lot of Early Access is considered failures or scams, eventually being abandoned by devs, I don't believe this is one of them. Sure it's slow, but how long does it take a AAA company to pump out a mediocre game with teams of 100s of people? Two or three years? This game has less people, and are working on a level of immersion I have yet to see in an FPS. I'd say that would take a lot of time.\n\nNow, call me crazy, maybe I wasted hundreds of dollars, (Yes, I spent several hundred dollars), but I am excrutiatingly picky about games I buy, and even pickier about games I "invest" in. To date, only one of them has "failed" me, and that's Star Forge. Should this game succeed, I can see it changing the face of the FPS genre from here on out. A lot of "new" FPS's are simply revamped graphics with the same content. This one promises to introduce new "features."\n\nBottom line:\nDon't buy if you are: Impatient, don't have faith in Early Access as a general rule, expect a whole lot of content right out of the box (current box at the time of this writing)\n\nDo buy: If you actually read what I wrote, are willing to place faith in a potentially genre-changing title, don't mind slower updates.\n\nWhy: Because no matter if you buy it now or not, if the game fails, it's impossible that you will have wasted as much money as myself (Unless you also bought into the stock option back then, in which case I was on the lower tiers).","March 16, 2015","true","9.6"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","12","20","0","1"

The devs are active within the community and if you join the steam community group you'll be notified about the community events where one of the devs livestreams the game on twitch, talks to players on teamspeak, and everyone has a really good time so be sure to check that out.\n\nOne thing people forget when commenting on how incomplete an early access game is, is how much opportunity there is to give feedback at a time where it can actually be implemented into the game.

It punishes head-long derp rushes a la Halo, GOW, or Unreal Tournament, instead rewarding careful movement, foresight, tactical analysis, and a steady ♥♥♥♥-you gun hand. While in it's current state (Update 10 as of this writing) feels sort of limited (one gun, no customization, missing several features of other FPS game like sprinting or melee), the gunplay is solid, the movement is slick, the graphics as beautiful (especially on ultra. Dat Pc Master Race), and the maps are amazing (Pitch black? Do you dare risk the flashlight for some clear sight that everyone else can see? Turn on the laser sight for some accurate hipfire at the expense of everyone seeing where the ♥♥♥♥ you are?

This is one of the most intense and immersive FPS ive played, it has amazing potential and is just hellafun, I HAVE NEVER HAD THIS MUCH FUN WITH AN !EARLY ACCSES GAME! The maps are amazing, the way the enviornment and sounds works make it feel real. I love the weather, usually in games like minecraft i would hate the rain, but i absolutly love it when it rains in this game, its amazing. And in most games, the sound is somtimes overlooked by users, one of the many things that stands out about this game is the sounds, you CANT play this game and not stop to enjoy the sounds of rain patting down on barricades... even if you just got shot in the head. I pat the men and women on the back who put those sounds in the game. The controls are very smooth and the character animations are great! One thing that also stands out is the lack of a HUD, usually in FPS's you have your health, amunition, and energy all just stuck to your face, in Interstellar Marines you are looing through a simple dang fancey lookin helmet, nothing to break the immersion. And the way they did the helmet ammo display is awesome, also if you press h you can lift up your helmet, making for an amazing immersive experience that i havent seen in another game. Overall i highly reccomend INTERSTELLAR MARINES and i love where its going.

In it's current form is very entertaining and fulfilling experience after you understand the mechanics underlying everything. Now, the game does suffer from poor framerates for the average computer and tanks my FPS with AA applied. Being that this is Update 10 it's to be expected. Now, this game brings some serious game changers to the FPS scene. You have variable environments mid level, meaning that you have daylight, rain, red alerts, or pitch black and likely more to come. Then you have actual movement mechanics, aiming mechanics, and cover system.

Interstellar Marines is a game that places you in the front lines as an interstellar marine, combat trained and ready to go into many training zones filled with extreamely lifelike sounds and weather simulations that make you feel as if you are really there. Although, this game is in Pre-Alpha it is a great game, with emersable graphics and sounds, smooth gameplay if you know how to custumize the settings, and easy to play; if your comp is glitchy there is the visual lag customization in the settings allowing ou to smooth out those irritating laggs and play with visability. BUT! we al know what the betas and alphas offer guys, so be prepared for crazy glitches and wild shizz for there is a lot to make you laugh, yell/rage, and even cry over those sneeky little arachnids in the corners of the dreadful walls. all together i say buy the spearhead package, for this game has a lot to offer and more to contribute, but, in a new perspective with all the games people-THIS.

Though fear not, though we've had some shaky EA games recently, the attention to detail and updates coming to this game show no sign of slowing down. We received a campaign type map mode to play either singleplayer or cooperatively, there's also another more linear map that can be played singleplayer or cooperatively, and then there are the whole host of survival and extinction maps to play either singleplayer or cooperatively. This is all on top of the previous PvP game mode that was already implemented.\n\nThe coop and singleplayer have you facing against both armed and unarmed CTRs, or Combat Training Robots. There is a small bug where when you kill an armed one it still comes up saying unarmed, and it says +15 points for killing one when you only get 5; but they're minor issues.\n\nThe dev team at Zero Point Software really know how to do atmosphere. In some of the survival modes, near the end of the sequence the whole map goes pitch black, you HAVE to use your flashlight. Of course, this means you can only see in the direction you're facing, it also means that when you reload the light points into the air somewhat as it's an underbarrel mounted flashlight. This makes for super intense moments when you can hear the unarmed CTRs running towards you, but have no idea where they are.\n\nThe environments are also amazing, the rain and effect it leaves on your helmet visor, the fog, the alarm lighting, and just the areas you're dropped into in general. Definitely a fantastic game, if you ever see it in a bundle, I would buy it without question as you will not regret it, even the Steam store asking price isn't bad for what you're getting, especially with the stream and quality of updates.","February 12, 2014","true","7.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

And the company behind it (Zero Point Software) actually has the will and desire to make it that. The game currently is "less then 1% complete", however thats not a reason to not buy it. Every dollar towards the game goes towards making the game better, not towards the developers wallets. They themselves have said several times they only care about making this game the best and most imersive game it can possibly be, its not about the money. And this is a team that i say we can actually trust, they have been working with the community the whole time with development. If you care at all about an actual well made game, and a gaming company that actualy cares about their game (and they actually PLAY their own game, unlike other dev teams i have seen). Then you MUST support this game, it is the dream of a better future for the gaming industry and the dream of a great game, you will believe in Interstellar Marines.\n\nFor the love of the game!","July 3, 2013","true","457.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Runs smoothly, looks very immersive with its dynamic weather and small touches like the raindrops hitting the helmet. The helmet itself features a HUD and if you lift the helmet up it's a HUDless view. A few graphical bugs here and there, but nothing gamebreaking at all; things like your gun disappearing into the wall if you stand too close, or snow falling through walls.\n\nGameplay: plays like a tactical Source game, with aim down sights and sprinting. A lot of emphasis on the sound around you, and the environment plays a big part in the gameplay, like when lights dim and you're forced to use your flashlight, while exposing your position in doing so. At the moment there is only one gun to use, so everything is balanced, and the hitboxes are fair.\n\nOverall, it's a very fun game with a level of immersion you rarely see in shooters. It almost seems like a finished product, yet it's only in alpha stage. Very interested to see what the devs make of it over the coming months.","November 20, 2013","true","8.0"," 21 of 38 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","21","38","0","0"

Loving the gameplay and graphics.\n\nFor gameplay, just check out youtube videos, the developers have done a fantastic job on releasing detail videos explaining/showing -. But bear in mind they are still in developing stages. At first i was very frustrated with their slow updates, but soon after  viewing the updates i've realized the heavily amount of work they put into, in detailing almost every aspect of the actual gameplay (lightening, shades, SOUND EFFECTS, it's just quite a ride. These maps the producers produce, ARE ONE OF THE MOST SOPHISICATED MAP'S I'VE SEEN, in regards to the quality of realism they bring to the game.\n\nAll i can say is i am crazily looking forward towards the completed version of this game, which they aim to do so by the end of 2014.\n\nAs a pc fps game player for over 15 years, i'd say they've made a work of art out of pc FPS. (in progress), under the circumstances that they deliver a consistent game content update as from their vision they've shown in their videos (more guns, SHARK AI's!!!, co-op maps).\n\nThese guys are the REAL deal.

The game features a very interesting, and realistic lighting system, where some times the map will put players into total darkness. This will force players to start using their flashlight which will of course give them away to enemy fire. Certainly an interesting take on a risk-reward system for a tactical FPS. The game also features mid-match dynamic level alterations. The game map will change, closing and opening new choke points and paths, mid match, in real time. This has a dynamic effect on the game field. Lastly the game features a ridiculous amounts of capture points in it's game mode. This came off as a negative, almost as a design flaw at first, but the more I played I saw what the designer had in mind. This tactical shooter encourages spiting up and covering ground, rather than the usual, 7 man in a choke point cluster F*** that the usual tactical shooter tend to lean towards.\n\nThe game's audio, and visual is impressive, and it's attention to detail as well as it's lighting is equally so.\n\nThe game is not with out it's faults though. In it's current stage of early access, there is no single player campaign, minimal tutorial, only one game mode, and only the default rifles hurt this game's variety. The game also has some net code issues as it has noticeable and undeniable bullet lag. Interstellar Marines also face the hurdle of developing a robust and active community, in the face of hundreds if not thousands of other tactical shooters, fighting for the same audience. Currently the game's community is active, but relatively small. Only 1-3 servers will any sort of population at any given time, or even less.\n\nBut overall, Interstellar Marines is a very enjoyable game that has a pile of potential! I think the game should change it's name as it's incredibly generic, and also promote it's unique light and dark play more to help interest more people.\n\nPros:\n- Unique Light / Dark mechanic\n- Unique mid-game battlefield transformation mechanic\n- Impressive visuals, especially the lighting\n- Very enjoyable and playable, even as an early access\n\nCons:\n- Needs more variety\n- Net code needs a lot of working out\n- Needs to build a larger community","July 20, 2014","true","5.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Its flawed, unforgiving, and literally can only continue to get better as its foundations are already so solid.

From what I've seen in the hour I played last night (going to do gameplay vid later) it has aspects that can be found in many classic games from the past, allowing players to be able to feel instantly familiar with it. On the other hand it manages to also add new elements that have never been seen before such as a mask with your HUD.

I was quite the fanboy of the game back then. I may update this review to fit the games current state and to get rid of my past fanboyism.\n\nI understand that some people think that this game sucks because you can't jump (which you can now), crouch, there's only one weapon ATM.\nBut hey! How many shooting weapons did Mario have in the first Mario game? One! (The fireball) Was it a bad game? Not it was really fun and it still is! (I know cause I have it for the NES :-D)\n\nSo why is that relevant? That is because it's just features! You don't even need these features for a game to be fun! I understand that some people have standards these days because every FPS game include loads of weapons and stuff but in the end: You don't need it to have fun! Simple games can be fun! Remember Minecraft in alpha? That was really simple but still really fun!\n\nAlso! This is a game somewhere between alpha and pre-alpha so what did you expect? You're not seppose to expect games with a lot of content if you buy games on Early Access!\n\n\nNow! Since this is a somewhat review I guess I gotta say my overall opinion about the game and stop telling people why they are wrong about the game.\nI will review this while keeping in mind that it is in alpha.\n\nInterstellar Marines is a really fun game if you get together with some guys in a match. It can be challenging if you're new to the game but it doesn't take much time to get the hang of it.\nThe graphics are pretty decent for an indie title.\nThe game runs smoothly even at 40 FPS (I have a hard time playing other games at 40 FPS).\nThe maps are fun and exciting and there are many ways to trick or storm your enemy with many entry points, hiding places and sniping positions.\nThe maps also have this really amazing dynamic weather system where it changes the weather a few times while playing a match. Some times it gets really foggy and other times it gets so dark that you can't see anything without the flashlight on but if you turn it on you will reveal your position to the enemy. I personally think that the darkness in this game is one of the most amazing things in a game. My heart always starts pumping of excitment when it gets dark and this is one of those few games that arn't scared of the dark cause I've seen a lot of games with dark level where you can just barly see without a flashlight but in this game it's a different story! Which adds some realism and immersion to the game.\n\nI got a little ahead of my self with that darkness talking so let's just get to the pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n+ Playable at 40 FPS\n+ Fun and challenging\n+ Dynamic weather\n+ Amazing darkness\n+ Decent graphics\n+ Great maps for tactical opportunities\n(+) One really unice map that changes the height of it's floors while playing\n+ Fun gamemode (Domination like)\n+ Nice sound\n+ Singleplayer room made for players to test the new features\n\nCons:\n- Only one playable gamemode even though they've made two\n- None of their two singeplayer modes from the official site in the game\n- No connection to your user made on the official site\n- Progress feels kinda slow\n\n(I didn't like to write that last con because I'm a fan of the game and I understand why it's going slowly but it doesn't change the fact that it's going slowly)\n\nSo this is my review of Interstellar Marines in it's current version (version 7).\nSince this is a game in alpha state I might make a new review of it when it's fully released cause you can't really rate a product that isn't done yet. If this was the final release then yes. It would not be worth the money but it is in alpha so I do actually think this is worth the money.\n\n\n- Martin Schultz / Mtsmts","December 8, 2013","true","79.1"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","8"

Some very unique features of this game include the almost immediate death and the weather mechanics.  This is a game in which the old run n' gun technique will almost always get you killed.  Often the best strategy involves using a suppressor and sneaking around until you can ambush your enemies.\n\nSome subjective and personal positive aspects to the game I have noticed are:\n\nLosing your HUD once you take a certain amount of damage.\nIn this game's multiplayer it is nearly impossible to tell friendly soldiers from your enemies without the use of your HUD.  The feature which temporarily removes use of your HUD makes being wounded even more frantic because when you turn to run you need to look twice to make sure the marine behind you is friendly.\nA feature which closely accompanies the loss of your HUD is the ability to open your helmet.  By pressing "H" you are able to completely disengage your display and open your helmet.  This comes in handy when it is raining because the rain will obstruct your vision by sticking to your visor.\n\nOperable doors.\nMost FPS these days have decided to remove the idea of operable doors in their multiplayer modes.  I beleive that it is a strong suite for this game they have not decided to do that as well.  When opening a door on a map such as Dynacore you can't tell if some one is hiding on the other side.  Doors are also very useful as cover from enemy fire.  It also adds a degree of realism and dynamic gameplay.\n\nWeather/Day night system.\nThis game has fully dynamic shadows and a weather system which has been expertly fleshed out.  You have different weather conditions from rain to snow to high winds.  The rain will greatly obstruct your vision while your helmet is down. The snow reduces visibility in general and plays tricks with your mind because of the movement. The winds add slightly more chaos to the area however are likely the least influential of the three.\nThe day and night rotations are incredibly important in any game of Interstellar Marines.  In the day time you have only a very small chance of successfully hiding.  In the dusk and at night you will have a much easier time at remaining concealed.  You will also learn that the use of a flashlight is unadvisable to say the least.  The dynamic changes in weather and time force players to change their strategies whenever the map decides that it got bored.\n\nLastly, the dynamic motions of elements in the maps.\nMany of the multiplayer maps have different structures of elements within the maps themselves which will periodically move.  This will force players to change their routes and hiding spots as hallways are cut off and buildings rise into the air and sink into the ground.\n\nNow for what I dislike about the game in its current state.  Please be advised everything listed below is subject to change.  Alpha = Alpha\n\nThe game has very few weapons at the moment.\nI am personally very happy learning to use two different weapons proficiantly.  But for those of us who want more variation you may have a hard time excepting the lack of variety in your choice of weapons.  On top of this there is only a few small differences in the way the two current weapons handle.  The Rifle has more accuracy over the SMG but it quickly loses that with sustained fire.  The SMG has an additional 10 rounds over the Rifle bringing it to a total of 30.  It also has iron sights with a much lower magnification that allows it to be used in close quarters combat, as opposed to the 4x scope on the Rifle.  However besides these small differences the guns are essentially identical.\n\nMovement system.\nAlthough perfect in almost all situations, the movement system has its flaws.  The devs have nerfed sprinting and jumping by forcing you to start panting after a certain amount of either running or hopping about.  My concerns with this mechanic in its current state are as follows; Jumping rarely allows you to overcome an obstacle the first try.  After your second or third attempt you begin panting for as long as 20 seconds afterwards.  In multiplayer it can also get tiresome when you are trying to catch up with your team on the map Evacuation and you start to pant, then you encounter and enemy and your crosshair is bouncing all over the screen.\n\nEarly Access.\nThe game is currently in development.  Listen to me when I say that this game is in EARLY ACCESS.  That means when you buy it you are admitting that this is the product you want in its CURRENT STATE.  Although I think this game deserves all the support it needs to have a successful launch, you must understand that there is no guarantee it will ever be released, and there is no guarentee there will ever be another update.  If you decide to spend your money on this game, I would say its worth every cent.  But at the same time you must make certain you want this game and not the Interstellar Marines that you are thinking about 5 years down the line.\n\n\nPlease remember this is a preliminary review of an early access game which is subject to change.  Before perchasing you should look at other reviews and perhaps some video coverage of it online.\n\n\nThank you,\n\nAviatorFox","February 14, 2015","true","19.8"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","8","13","2","0"

I'm grateful for the amount of content that has been released within the past few years. This gets me rather  excited for what is to come upon the next few months. Mostly because of the amount of game content that we have now is rather impressive. The game has multiple modes that such as Single player and  Coop campaign missions, Horde style game modes where players must defend off waves of killer robots,  and the standard multiplayer team deathmatch where players must take over control points in order for their team to win. (  think of it like the Conquest mode from the  battlefield games but on a smaller scale.)  And lets not forget that this game has a hunger games-ish gamemode where players are put against each other  in LARGE maps. The main idea is to be the last man( or woman) to  survive the hour long match. The graphics in this game is great to look at.  the lighting and the sound within this game is just drop dead EXCELLENT.  The sounds of gun shots make the feeling of shooting within the game feel meaningful.  the hunting rawrs the robots make when they spot you from a point of view. With so much good to be said about the game. it does come into some faults. One of the coop maps are bit bugged right now. its a bug that disconnects you from the coop map before you even play it. This game requires  a bit of heavy specs to play on if you want to fully take in the experience more smoothly. Overall, for a steam early access game its quite impressive to see how much content has been added and how much more will be added into the future.\n\nTLDR: 8.8 out ten.  its a great game but it is a bit of buggy and demands more Mid- high range  PCs to run.","December 2, 2014","true","118.0"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

Unlike most early access games, this is one perhaps truly deserving of attention and in desperate need of funds. IM is one of only a handful of other early access games that I can think of truly in development, and it shows. It has a few place holder items at the moment, that in due time will be replaced. And, unlike almost any other early access title, IM is funded only by your own, and my own patronage - and perhaps the only one not funded by a kickstarter. This game doesn't happen without purchased copies or, if you have an account on the IM website, through small $5 donations. If you don't have an account, but still want to support this game, perhaps without purchasing or lacking enough funds to purchase a copy, go to the Interstellar Marines website, create an account, and make donations here and there.

Sad really that the Developer, and many players, think MMO technology require forced PVP, as though the erroneous assumption of saving money is more important than having money to save...Without buyers of the game, meaning: people who love something about the game so much they'd pay for it and Developers showing respect for that by not forcing them into activities they didn't buy the game for, there is no money to be saved. That is the epicfail of Zeropoint by making the game so PVP based PVE players only see themselves as griefed after paying money. If not for a free weekend one time I probably would have bought this game and been even more ticked off about the situation, of course the Developer probably sees that as a "winning tactic" to get more money, the money their object not developing the game nor having a quality product in the gaming industry over the long-term.\n\nIn most circles if you buy something and then it changes or is changed away from what it posed itself to be, that's called fraud, better known as "bait and switch," and when the Developer hides behind the Early Access legal fiction AFTER taking our money, and uses this to not develop the game according to the market that has shown interest by paying money, if without intention that's incompetence and they don't deserve to succeed. However, as is usually the case, such as with Starforge, it is with intention and that's called Gross Negligence, which in many cases is tantamount to fraud legally.\n\nPoint being, if the Developer has abandoned or is not making any effort to make the game appeal to the market, thereby securing the funds by profits from sales, funds they need to develop the game further, then whatever money they want is just stealing, irrespective of whether it's Early Access or not. Buyer beware is the axiom they depend on, which, if the company is actually trying to reach and grow their market is a reasonable idea, however, when the company exercises reckless abandon and utter failure to listen to those who've played the game, fails to pay attention to the cries for the game to be more appealing, and, fails to pay attention to how many walk away because the Developer thinks they can hide behind Early Access and ignore the players, then the entire idea of Early Access fails, and is merely a ruse to steal being taken advantage of by Con-Artists. Buyer beware is not an excuse to defraud peolpe of their money.","February 9","false","4.8"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

Have you even considered how scary it would be to get chased down in first person by a great white sprinting at you?\n\nSome say that the IM community is the best community by far, all I know is that a game is only as good as its community when it comes to games with multiplayer.\n\nI've been vague on this review, but just wanted to add more and keep building on it so it's the start.","October 16, 2014","true","14.3"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","12","21","0","2"

Runs at 60 sometimes, but drops to 30 at random locations for no reason.\n\nThe sound design is pretty great for the most part but there appears to have a lot of gitches. Such as heavy breathing loop, audio cuts, and reverb in areas/senerios where it shouldn't be.\n\nEDIT* Sound problems are still as persistent as ever, seems that extended play will lead to that looping heavy breathing gltich.\n\nIt also lacks content and reply value.\n\nThere are plenty of maps to play in, but lack of good enough AI and or gunplay to keep it exciting.\n\nAI spot you across the map in dark sections of the map no problem and headshot you. AI run into walls, get caught on each other, glitch through stars.\n\nThis game at its current state is not worth the buy.

Simply Preambulating the strange but really cool scifi environments is a pleasure. The game seems heavily based on knowing your surroundings and being quiet and stealthy. Some of the maps are nearly pitched black and you could 5 feet away from the enemy and they would have no idea your there. But its on you, cuz your the one whos being careful. You can hide in bushes and be near invisible. This doesnt make anything overpowering to other players as you would see if youve played it. All of the maps (the ones I've played) have an element that changes the whole map. In Elevation, different sections of the map will ascend or descend. On Evacuation, the map has weather elements that go from sneaking in the middle of the night, to being careful with every step you take on a clear afternoon.

Currently the only weapon available is an assault rifle, and you have access to a laser sight and flashlight to help you see what you're aiming at. I've still no idea what benefits there are to having your visor up (or down) but it'll be interesting to see how they implement it.\n\nThe map I just played was Team Deathmatch, and the level design was like a big indoor warehouse with side corridors and huge crates stacked up everywhere. The lighting was dim, but not bad enough that I needed to use the flashlight.\nWe played for a while and... the lights started coming on. Dark alcoves became poor places to hide, and suddenly I was able to spot people by their shadows as they passed lighting.\nA while later, the lighting shifted again as alerts went off and red lights flashed about. Hearing footsteps was more difficult and watching shadows was near-impossible.\nAnd then... darkness. The luminescent bars on the edges of walls and on the crates made it possible to move about, but suddenly the match became a round of Marco Polo as we turned on our flashlights to check out an area and turned them off just as quickly so we wouldn't be spotted. That was exceptionally FUN, and I'd love to play that level again. :-D\nIt's amazing what the difference of a little bit of lighting can do to a game.\n\nThis game is far from finished, but it has a lot of potential. If you get the chance, give this a go.","July 24, 2013","true","1.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But as of now, there is only one game mode (team deathmatch), no single player campaign, and it takes forever to connect to one of the few available servers. Plus, the multiplayer is pretty bland and unbalanced. As of now, I don't think that Interstellar Marines is worth it. However, I think that you should buy this game now (the price goes up with every update) and just wait for it to be completed. If this game ends up being even half as good as it's supposed to turn out, it could easily become the best FPS on PC.","May 25, 2014","true","6.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Simply Preambulating the strange but really cool scifi environments is a pleasure. The game seems heavily based on knowing your surroundings and being quiet and stealthy. Some of the maps are nearly pitched black and you could 5 feet away from the enemy and they would have no idea your there. But its on you, cuz your the one whos being careful. You can hide in bushes and be near invisible. This doesnt make anything overpowering to other players as you would see if youve played it. All of the maps (the ones I've played) have an element that changes the whole map. In Elevation, different sections of the map will ascend or descend. On Evacuation, the map has weather elements that go from sneaking in the middle of the night, to being careful with every step you take on a clear afternoon. I cant say Ive necessarily played a game with the same feel as this. It's still in Beta, but as long as the team keeps working on this; It already has a lot of potential.","January 25, 2014","true","0.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is a first person shooter in which you have to use your environment to your advantage, cooperate and eleminate your ennemies. It's gameplay style is very similar to America's army, if you think about it.\n\nYou have four options when starting the game:\nSingle player\nCo-op\nMultiplayer\nPlayground\nThey are all fun, and each add some variety . (In Co-op, you fight bots, literally)\n\nPros:\nAs of right now, there are not many good things; as in there is nothing spectacular.\n-Environment interactions\n-Graphics look good (like the helmet visor)\n-Great maps\n-You shoot people\n\nCons:\nInterstellar marines is currently in early access, so I can forgive it's faults, but here are a couple.\n-Only 2 weapons (rifle and assault rifle)\n-Running only works when going straight.\n-Only quality specs to lower are for the shadows\n-When incapacitated, there is no way to know if you are being healed or what.\n-Recoil a bit too high\n\nThese are pretty minor and will probably be fixed.\n\nOverall, it's an enjoyable game. Unless if you are willing to play something with not much variety, I say wait out.

This means that the playable content is very limited. However, there are 2 large co-op missions, 5 smaller co-op missions, 8 player versus player maps (I think), 2 weapons (customization is going to be added in later on for weaponry), five movement speeds (crouching, walking, crouch-running, jogging, sprinting)... it is already incredibly advanced for a game in Early Access, and the developers play the game as well, to communicate with the community and see what they want, and have excellent presence on the forums.\nThere are some glitches in the game. Naturally; it's Early Access. However, there are so few compared to most Early Access games, or even FPS games in general, that it's almost mind-boggling. Each update is extensively tested and prepared before it becomes available to a small segment of the community - Spearhead testers - and are then further scanned for glitches and bugs before being made available to the entire community.\nMany people had a bad experience during the Free Week, and gave this game bad reviews. Unfortunately, this is mostly because of people playing it on the Free Week only to annoy other players, and the limited customization available at this point. However, what many people don't seem to understand is that it is in Early Access, even though it entered Free Week; it's nowhere near complete, and rating it as if it were the full game is unfair to the developers and potential buyers.\nNow on to gameplay.\nWhen I first began playing the game, I went into multiplayer. DO NOT DO THIS. The game is so extraordinarily fast-paced that unless you play co-op and single player first, the people in PvP will be killing you so fast you'll suspect they're hacking - quick hint, they're not; they've generally played the game for literally days straight, and have become fifty times as good as any beginner. Don't think you can compete just because you've played other FPS games.\nThe robots in single player and co-op are still a tremendous challenge. Start off Easy and find that, without other people to revive you, you're dead in minutes. Two to five shots will kill you in Easy, and it only gets harder.\nOne thing I've found is that many people complain that Realistic isn't any harder than the other modes. Here's the thing: It is, but not for the reasons most people think. Yes, the robots one-shot you on Realistic. Yes, they have a shorter delay to begin attacking once they see you. Yes, they see you better in good lighting and notice you more quickly in bad lighting. However, the real thing that got me was that the closer you are, the faster they react; open a door and there's a robot immediately on the other side? You're dead.\nIn spite of this game being in Early Access, the amount of content already implemented is amazing, and the gameplay and realism of the game is incredible. So there are a few glitches and fewer weapons than you'd want in an FPS game. So what? It's still remarkably complete for something in this stage.\nI would definitely recommend buying this game, and if you don't feel like it's right for you, check back in a month or two; the content increases with updates constantly. The results might surprise you.","February 27, 2015","true","132.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

It seems pretty realistic too (as far as that's doable in a SciFi setting), but without being annoying about it. It's great to wander around in pitch-black darkness and the adrenaline rush when something pops up right next to or behind you is something you don't find in many games these days. I didn't try much "PvP" yet, but it also seems fun I guess... it really feels like the game is focused on coop though, but I don't mind that. It's better to focus on polishing one thing first rather than trying to do everything at once and ending up with mediocre results.\n\nWhat's bad:\nThere's some bugs and the engine could offer better performance (as in, graphics look decent, but not good enough to warrant the fps drops that happen sometimes), and it definitely feels like there should be more content... but hey, it's still early access, and it's probably the most polished early access game I've come across in a long time. Also, the devs try to keep the community up to speed on their plans and what's planned next. They also seem to talk to people on the forums, so that really seems promising. It's sad when a game has an interesting concept but the devs make you feel like they don't care anymore and abandoned the project without notice - this is not the case for Interstellar Marines, in my opinion. I really appreciate that.\n\nThere isn't much left to say. It probably won't become my competitive game of choice, but after Warframe, Payday 2 and Insurgency, this is something new to waste my time on with friends, and I'm really looking forward to the new content even though I still have to try more of what's already there.","February 19, 2015","true","15.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The only problem is that the developers have focused on multiplayer while ignoring the single player portion.

Ergo, it's not a finished product.\n\nTime of writing this review: 30/03/2014 03:10 AM (+0:00 GMT)\n\nI've been meaning to do this review for a while but now I felt I should do it now. Too save you from reading a giant essay on why I love this game. I love everything about it. The community is one of the nicest ones I've encountered, sure, there's teamkillers, but the community notifies one another about a teamkiller if he's ingame with them. The staff team (I've only encountered one and from my experience and the experiences from a few others) are extremely friendly and nice.\n\nThis game ran on my PC which has a 3.7 GHz Quad Core AMD A10-6700 and 620 GT surprisingly well. Sure, I got 17-20 FPS, but I have to take in account that the game is in alpha, and more optimizations are to be made before the release of the finished product or the release of the beta.\n\nThe gameplay itself is quite fun, a little slow paced but nothing too slow. You will encounter different dynamic enviroment changes and enviroments. There is rain which can affect your visibility by wettening the visor on your helmet. There's night time which makes you choose between sight and stealth and a few others. The game has a cover system as of Update 10 which is actually better than most game's cover systems in my unprofessional opinion. The gun's recoil is a bit.. much and can be a little frustrating when using the sight to aim down but you really have to fire in burst shots to get the most.\n\nThis game is quite bug free and glitch free, in my entire month of owning the game, I've only encountered one bug. Which was a wall not being solid and letting the player walk through, could be abused if the wrong people find the bug. (Told the staff member I encountered about it)\n\nTactics isn't really teambased as there's a lack of teamchat unless you're using Steam Chat and that's really it.\n\nA little side note: You will be seeing a load of players again and again. It's fun seeing players again and knowing how good they are.","March 29, 2014","true","20.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","2"

Clever usage of the silencers and the flashlight is a must. Though in early access, the game still feels pretty complete, packing in some replayable single player missions, co-op, and a unique multiplayer experience. The environments are well done, and change often, forcing you to adapt in order to survive. The Colony map even changes shape in between and during rounds, Maze Runner style. More awesomness is sure to come with future updates. If you like tactical fps games, I highly recommend this one.\n\nP.S. The game can be quite challenging in pvp or on higher difficulties. Be prepared for a licking until you get the hang of things.\n\n","April 1, 2015","true","64.0"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

The developers of Interstellar Marines, Zero Point Software (or ZPS, for short), are some die hard gamers themselves, probably remembering the "good old times" of FPS, which are definitely over today.\n\nPlaying the multiplayer part of the Early Access version feels very different to those AAA big budget titles released today. One thing which is a very positive thing and a very important one for me personally, is the netcode. I adjusted the network smoothing slider in game all the way to the left, and Interstellar Marines is basically lag free. Something you usually don't find in AAA titles today. If you own Battlefield 4 for example, you know what I'm talking about. Of course Interstellar Marines has the occasional hick up here and there, but that's probably due to the connection of the other players. At least for me, if I experienced lag, it was coming from the same players usually.\n\nMy own internet connection is pretty slow, but stable. I have a DSL3500 connection with an average ping of 50ms. And like I said, lag free in this game. I usually play on the "All maps (EU)" server.\n\nTo describe the smoothness of the network code, the last titles I remember to be that smooth were Unreal Tournament (the original one from 1999!), Quake 3 or Counterstrike (not Source, I mean the old one). So if you're an old school gamer like myself and remember at least one of the titles, you know what you're up to. If you have a good aim, you'll hit your enemy. Easy as that.\n\nThe overall graphics so far are not top of the line of course, but the lighting effects definitely are. The dynamic lighting in the multiplayer maps (remember: all environments are deeply underground in a training facility, with artificial weather, lighting etc.) is creating a tension at night it's mind blowing.

Playing Interstellar Marines in this current version feels a little similar to Counter Strike Source to me, minus the flashbang, grenade and AWP madness.

The single player gameplay is kinid of old school with very limited story and repetitive fairly plain levels and graphics. On the upside the game seems to run smoothly and the engine is ver responsive and seems well suited to a twitch and shoot.\n\nI should mention that I generally don't do multiplayer, or co-op, so can't comment on those modes.  This review is only about the single player mode.  Something that is kind of surprising is that so far in the first two levels, the only enemies are these dumb robots that seem like they are modeled after the "droid" soldiers in Star Wars.  The have a similar metalic voice and the AI is kind of predictable, and a little clutzy and, well, dumb-- just like in Star Wars.  From the title, "Interstallar Marines" I was expecting some aliens or maybe a race of militant humanoids like in Kill Zone.  But, no joy-- all lyou get are these dumb robots.\n\nAs dissppointing as the robots are, a larger weakness is that there currently seems to be no way to save progress.  What this means is that if you are killed on a level you have  to start over from the beginning.  This is especially painful when almost at the end of a level.  After playing the first level  for about a half hour, and almost "exfiltrating" the compound, I was killed at the last moment (by a dumb robot who didn't die even after I emptied a full clip in hsi stupid face).  The thought of having to start from the beginning was too unpleasant to contemplate, so I quit and played a different game --one with a way to save progress.\n\nSo far this game has single player potential,  and I like to support Indie developers.  If you wnat to support development then spend a couple of bucks on this early access, but don't expect too much from the single player mode at this  point-- my guess is that the single player mode is more of an after thought with little focus or effort from the developers.  Hopefully there will be an improved single player update soon.","June 11, 2015","true","1.8"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

When in development the goal is usually to make a rough wireframe of the game.  As everyone knows, you can't edit and refine what doesn't exist.  However, this team doesn't know this.  They seem to want to appease players with small updates so that they can forever have a stream of money, with no effort involved.\n\nWhen painting a picture, a scketch is drawn out first.  When making a road a path is cleared before concrete is poured.  When constructing a house a frame is built before the walls.  Games are suppose to be made in a similar fashion.\n\nThe game that was promised years ago will at this snails pace take decades to complete.\n\nBy then it will have been forgotten, and nobody will miss it.","February 6","false","12.5"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

You will find it harder to aim, your heavy breathing will make it harder to hear also.\n-Hearing is just as important as seeing.\n-Minimal hud but still full of tons of information, however it deactivates when your suit is damaged.\n-That light giving away your position in the dark?  Try shooting it out\n-React to conditions and accept consequences dynamically.  Silent enviroment? Players/bots will hear you running.  Dark Enviroment?  Players/bots will see your flashlight.\n\nSolo/Coop:\n-Solid AI, very well done.  Have fun tricking robots into looking behind boxes that they thought you ran behind.  Have fun getting mad when they see your muzzle flash/flashlight from across the map (just like you can).  They have similar restrictions as the player including health.  A fun challange to play on realistic.\n-Good assistance and teamwork mechanics.  Its easy to feel hindered when you have a bad team, in fact it is usually easier to play alone than with a bad team.  However with a good team you can cut through maps like melted butter.  Things like needing a teammate to watch your back or cover you while you reload actually can be quite benificial.\n-Level design and attention to detail.  Some of the best installation designs I've seen in a game.  Can be a bit overwhelming at first, just like if you walked into a real military research base or commercial space station.\n-Only a few weapons but they are well done and feel right.  Feels like a soldier getting a standard loadout.\n\nMultiplayer:\n-A dynamic training enviroment where the enviroment can wildly change from brightly lit to hurricane condtions to pitch black.  Very fun and totally changes the way the match is playing.\n-Want to run and gun?  That is okay but deal with the exhaustion and inability to aim well.  Want to run around with a laser sight (which acts as a crosshair) then be ready to give away your position.  There is no wrong answer to tactics, just results.\n\n\ntl;dr:\n\nThis game is fun and enjoyable.  Get to watch a single person take out a whole team using stealth in the dark.  Watch people complain that stealth has no purpose.\n\n11/10 would play again.\n","November 1, 2015","true","352.2"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

There are minor variations of gametype that essentially boil down to "kill all the guys" or "press all the buttons while you kill the guys".\nThis isn't bad in itself if the gameplay is engaging, but unfortunately it isn't. Bot AI will either run directly into your bullets or stand still and fire at you. The atmosphere with it's excellent sound design and moody lighting is obviously aiming for creepy, but all that ends up happening is that the four players fan out and clobber clueless bots, there's no tension, no real danger besides a bot spawning on you.\n\nThe multiplayer is just Insurgency with fewer guns, less varied maps and worse mechanics. It's a bog-standard twitch shooter with the supposed realistic weapon handling counting for nothing when everyone is hip firing in corridors at point blank range. All of the levels look like they're built from a single tileset as if they've been randomly generated. Everything looks the same.\n\nIt's pretty much impossible to play with your friends, you can't create servers, the only way to host a private game is to set your preference to "friends only", and then try to join one of the seemingly random servers that pops up while it's still empty, hoping that it's the gametype and map that you want, and that you won't be instantly spawnkilled by somebody who wants this server for themselves. There's also seemingly no way to change map or gametype once you're in the server.\n\nThis game uses "Early Access" as a blanket excuse for laziness, this game has been in development since May 2005.\nThink about that for a moment.\nTEN YEARS! It was originally supposed to release on PC and 7th gen consoles, this current version of the game that you're able to play today was Kickstarted in 2012, and is itself three years old.\nThis is all they have to show for it. This is the game. If you think the core mechanics and gameplay will improve from here you're optimistic, I'll give you that, because three years of work has given us an "Early Access Alpha" with off the shelf shooting mechanics and about as much content as a Kinder Surprise.\nMy bet is they're going to tack on more "campaigns" which basically amount to offline bot matches with text-to-speech voiceovers.","February 9, 2015","false","1.5"," 101 of 197 people (51%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","51","101","197","14","23"

My rating is subject to change once more is added.\n\n\nThe Review: ISM is very lite on content, to me. It has a couple multiplayer competitive maps, and a early demo for Co-op mode where you and a friend kill robots while trying to reach the roof. 2 guns, no grenades or customization or any other weapons, not even melee. The 2 guns are both Assault Rifles with emphasis on different engagement ranges.\n\nI see the potential for an amazing game, but right now it's just too simple. The lighting adds a good layer to the game, as well as the decision to use a laser and give away your position in return for better hip aiming. It seems you can take off your helmet but this currently seems to have no effect other than removing the hud; I assume this will result in your suit powering down (no lights) eventually, but it's not the case currently.\n\nIn summary: If you are you are interested in their concept, get this on sale maybe. I got it in a Humble Bundle and don't regret it. But if you want a good game to sink hours into, I don't see it happening here, yet. Keep an eye on ISM though, I do expect it to become awesome eventually.","August 31, 2014","false","0.8"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","11","20","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lowblockify/recommended/236370/","lowblockify","MW2 Intervention","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lowblockify/","862 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nEDIT: I did a bit of research after writing this and found that the game was actually announced *11* (ELEVEN) years ago.  That's right, this game has been around for over a decade and there still is nothing to show for it.  The most recent update as of May 21st 2016, rather than adding anything meaningful, added a new Main Menu UI and weapon skins, and the option to vote on what map you would like to play when your current round is over.  Two months for weapon skins and a new main menu.  Sorry folks but I don't think that asking for something other than that is very unreasonable at this point.  Please don't drop money on this until the devs have some actual, functionable content ready.\n\nI read a preview for the game I want to say around 6-7 years ago in the back of a magazine at the library.  It detailed what the developers wanted to do and how they wanted to do it.  Fast forward 6-7 years and so far we have a slightly above average multiplayer TDM/Domination game put together in Unity.  It's above average because they've obviously spent quite a bit of time and money putting the game together, there are some neat ideas in regard to how guns handle and how you move.  The sound design in particular is very well done, especially noting the differences when you play with your helmet on or off.  I purchased the Spearhead Edition for $45 on their website back in 2010 when I was back in college, back when the game was only playable in your browser and was only a few sets of target practice modes.  If the game had been released shortly after, even 2-3 years later, then it would have been fine.  However, that is simply not the case for Interstellar Marines.\n\nThe bad parts are, like I mentioned earlier, that this game has been in development hell for what will be coming up on a decade now.  There has been numerous issues, engine changes, failed crowdfunding attempts, "accidental" key giveaways that gave people who purchased the game all of the special legacy upgrades that people who paid $40+ five years ago originally had (Spearhead Edition benefits).  They say the concept is to have an "indie-AAA" where the production values are AAA while being "published by the community."  This is absolutely fine, and it's worked for many other developers and games.\n\nThis title, however, has been in development for *years* and the only progress that has been made is adding a relatively uninteresting multiplayer component (You would be *very* lucky to find more than a dozen or so people playing, even on their "Hell Weeks") and a few uninspired singleplayer missions that revolve around you shooting robots, collecting a handful of keycards, and racing to the endpoint.  This would be fine, but the amount of content, and how ultimately boring it turns out to be, is just not worth your time.  The environments are nothing more than large empty hallways and open rooms, with a handful of fences and doors.  Nothing stands out, nothing is memorable.  The robot AI consists of them walking in a straight line and trying to hit you, but they're slow, which means you can easily kill them before they get close.  About 4 years ago they released a standalone "museum" type level that showcased a variety of enemies and environments, none of which have been seen anywhere else in any other part of the game.\n\nThe community essentially being dead is the big kicker at this point.  Whoever is left defending the title at this point seem to have a fixation on making sure that there is nothing negative ever said about it.  If you check Youtube, Steam communities, etc, you'll see quite a few people going on about "FOR THE LOVE OF THE GAME", which is a phrase the developers came up with in regards to them developing a very generic coop military space shooter.  ZPS has done a phenomenal job of doing the bare minimum of development and making it out to be part of a massive game changing update.  I used to receive weekly emails that amounted to them saying:\n"UPDATE: Gun model revisions.\nUPDATE: Tweaked pistol sounds\nUPDATE: Added laser sigh, have fun ;)"\n\nIt's kind of odd to say the least, the devs have been somewhat forthcoming and open about the development process, and they do stay in contact with what little people still have faith in them.  But beyond all that as I mentioned before you aren't going to find a lot of people playing the multiplayer, even during peak hours it's practically impossible to find a full match, don't even get started on trying to find one with decent ping.\n\nAll else I can really say is: It's your money, it's $10, the game has been in development hell for years and I cannot in good consciousness recommend that you spend your money on this.  At this point, it's not worth the $40, and it's barely worth $10.  If ZPS can somehow pull something major off then props to them, but the game is just vaporware.  I doubt I'll be able to get my money back since I purchased the game 7 years ago and I doubt they still have records that I bought the game in the first place.","May 4","false","1.2"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","11","20","0","0"

While graphically pleasing, the game currently lacks what I consider to be any decent gameplay.  Multiplayer death matches are pretty much all you have to look forward to if you buy this game which is *not* worth the money in my opinion.  With these things in mind I will point out the pros and cons of this game as best as I see them.\n\nPros:\n\n(The graphics are more than I expected and makes the game look quite believeable.\n(Weapon performance is surprsingly good, with the sounds and recoil reminding me of actual rifles I have fired.\n(The heads up display mixed with the toggle modes on the helmet makes me feel like my head is actually in the helmet, which reminds me somewhat of the metro series.  This is a great immersion modifier.\n(The dynamic weather system the have in the arena is very well done and they demonstrate that they can develope immersive environments within their game.\n\nCons:\n\n(While the devs have multiple "gamemodes", all of them occur within an enclosed arena which, for me, gets dull really fast.  Again, the lack of gameplay variety just ruins this for me.\n(Next to no visible progress on this game.  I understand the time it takes to develope such things but their updates  are both irregular and sparse.  I see no indication that this game is going anywhere fast.\n(Lack of player customization leaves me feeling like a stormtrooper with no identity.  This breaks the immersion greatly in my mind.\n\nOverall I'd say that this game has the barebones framework that can be the foundation of something awesome, but sadly I don't believe it will be.  As I said, I see no noteworthy progress on the game and with that fact alone, I don't reccomend buying this game.","September 12, 2014","false","11.9"," 16 of 30 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","16","30","0","0"

I LOVE this game. now, don't let me make you think that it's a good game, it can only appeal to certain people.\nIf you're a person like me, who loves immersion (mostly the fact that your helmet is ACTUALLY right there in front of you) mixed with action (shooting insane robots in the face) with a touch of survival horror (being afraid, because damage is realistic), then you'll love this game. HOWEVER, if you like cod's gameplay over what I listed, then you probably won't like this.\nNow, watch some trailers, gameplay, look at some images, do whatever you have to do, but in my opinion, this game is amazing.\nNow, I do not play this game a lot, I actually played it twice so far, and I don't usually play the robo missions, I play multiplayer versus. The robots are too damn spooky. Some people love the robots, and I do too, just I can't find what reason I like playing multiplayer versus more than robo missionsI guess it's because I don't like having to restart, but even then, I also don't like waiting to respawn (cuz revenge).\nthe gameplay? awesome\nthe mechanics? awesome\nthe bugs? only a few, and sometimes it said "press space to spawn" presses space, jack ♥♥♥♥ happens\nkeep in mind, this review is posted while it is still in early access, however, there aren't really any gamebreaking bugs\nfinding a server? this is the one that I had semi- trouble with, because there was at least 100 servers, and there were literally 4 servers with pleople in it. FORGET about finding a specific map on a specific difficulty with people in it. that's almost impossible.\nfun? depends on you\nif you have any more questions about the game, comment on this review\nP.S. there are only 2 weps atm (at the moment)\n\nP.P.S.: ♥♥♥♥ my pants probably 7 times at this point\n\nMy rating: 9 dead + 1 decapitated scary ♥♥♥ robots/10","January 21, 2015","true","1.6"," 21 of 40 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","21","40","2","0"

There are multiple maps with envorinment settings. So you can go to one server with a map and it's raining, and as you play in the map the weather actually changes to where it'll be easier to fight, or to where it'll be harder to fight.\n\n-Weaponry/Equipment: At this time, there is only 1 weapon, which is an assault rifle. Yet, you also have the abiloity to activate a lazer for you to help with your accurasy, a flashlight incase it get's dark (game sometimes has you in pitch black darkness), of course you can zoom in by right-clicking, and unlike any sci-fi FPS, you can actually take off your visor. So it'll be like fighting with literally your own eyes. But the game doesn't give you a cursor to aim with like Halo, Battlefield, TF2, etc. You actually have to aim like everyone does in real life when in combat.\n\n-Maps: There are multiple maps that go from the middle of a swamp, to the cold regions, to a colony in the forest. All maps has the ability to change the weather to throw off players.\n\n-Game Mode: So far, there is only one game mode where you hold a certain area for the longest, but as time goes on, the capture zone will move into a different area of the map. In order to win, you must hold the capture zone for the longest when the time runs out, or when the amount of time you hold it reaches it's max. Either way, you have to work with your team in order to win. Cooperation and skill will bring you to victory in this game.\n\nOverall, this game is incredible for it to be an Early Access Game, I recommend this game to anyone that reads this.","May 7, 2014","true","5.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Like they should add in game currency so you can buy the attachments for your weapon because most of us feel that it gives us a sense of achievement in getting that item. They also should add a secondary weapon which would make it funner as there seems to be only one weapon in the game. Combat felt a bit dull but i think it still was pretty fun.

But not like, "Boo, paranormal, rah" terrifying.\n\nMost of the singleplayer and co-op missions so far are focused on retrieving intel or reaching certain areas all while avoiding/destroying malfuctioning test robots, controlled by AI. Along with dysfunctional robotic test dummies, the lights are usually flickering if not turned off altogether. That, combined with the many thin halls and corners in the campaign maps makes for a very nerve-racking experience. Not to mention the fact that the bots stomp loudly and run quickly, and thanks to the realistic lighting they can be standing in a shadow not three feet from you and you won't know until they stomp out of the darkness and assault you, and by then your mouse is on the floor and the keyboard is across the desk and you're curled up in fetal position praying for it to stop. I just played an ~8 minute campaign mission and suffered from at least three different anxiety attacks.\n\nBut this fantastic game isn't all spooks. The multiplayer is fun, the graphics and lighting look amazing, especially for an Early Access indie game made by an indie team. Also, the player-character wears a high-tech helmet, which justifies lens flare and the floating icons indicating control points, teammates and ammo. The helmet can also be removed by the press of a key, or if the player is shot sufficiently or in the right place. This turns off all of the indicators for players who want to be immersed even more. And, despite what I said above, there are a couple singleplayer and co-op missions that don't make one need new pants.\n\nI'd say the only cons of this game (keep in mind - it's only early access) are that so far the only weapons you get are a couple of assault rifles and some of the outdoor maps lag.\n\nAll in all, great game, and I'm sure it'll only get better.","February 23, 2015","true","7.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What can I say? Well, for one, CoD fans REALLY missed out on this one. Second, this review:\n\nInterstellar Marines is a sci-fi FPS that has AMAZING potential. I could see this being a revolutionary game in the near future. The devs are very involved with the community, it has a basic attatchment system, and the Co-op robots never seem to stop FREAKING ME THE HELL OUTOHMYGODPLEASEDONTKILLME!\nBut, in all seriousness, this game is a very solid, immersive game, with the only thing that could add to the immersion is Oculus support. The Winter Holidays event is DM with the T-IM101: A christmas-light-filled, yelling, insanely stat-boosted Arnold Shwarzeneggar inside a spacesuit that possesses you when you touch a present. Yeah.\n\nThe updates also never fail to bring new and interesting content, and you will be on the edge of your seat waiting for the next addition by Zero Pont Software.\nThere aren't many weapons, but after you have the basic weapons (Assault Rifle, Pistol, SMG, Sniper Rifle, maybe a Grenade Launcher as a special pickup, etc.), they should focus on customization & attachments (If they aren't doing that already). The few weapons only adds to the balance and tactical-ness of the game.\n\nHowever, no system is without its... Kinks. Phone Guy said that, and it is very true, especially with Early Access games. The updates DO take a while to come out, so you'll be on the edge of your seat for a while. There is, however, no issue with crashing or glitching as far as I'm concerned.\n\nSo, TL;DR, a very solid and immersive game with tight shooting, superb graphics, and updates and robots that never fail to impress and scare.

I like the design on the maps even the weather and time changes every 3ish minutes. Yes its not realistic but a challenge to use or not to use your flashlight. Its different and slow pase so if your looking for a fast killing game this game isnt for you. The spawn points are good, they arnt smashed together where the fight is happening. Plus other features like by pressing H your helmet opens up, you can see better but you wont know who are your team mates. Also by pressing G you enable or disable your red laser. OH and one other thing, if you look up you can see the map is surounded by a dome. I think its like some sort of simulator or something IDK.  But overall I pretty much like this slow pase futureistic FPS Sci-fi game :) I recommend buying this game when its out of early access. To see the final product or buy it now to see the progress? :D","February 15, 2014","true","3.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The maps and changing weather are amazing. The game right now is a lot of fun and it keeps getting better. The developers are always talking with their players and getting their input. This is a great game being made by great developers. Please note this an alpha. It's barebones and right now it's pretty much the map changing effects is the only thing that's finished.

The developers show that they care by using tons of detail. The enviornments change, from day to night to rain to snow in just a short match. The player has so many decisions to make when this fantastic enviornment changes, you can use a flashlight attachment to your gun, have a laser sight, open and close your helmet visor. For example, in the night you can choose to use your flashlight to find people or you can creep around in the shadows (in the dark.) Another nice feature is you can walk around the maps by yourself and get to them before challenging others. This game is early access so you can imagine there are a few turn-off's as of right now, lag, the campaign has not been added yet, and sadly as far as I know there is only 1 or 2 guns in multiplayer. Overall though I would recommend it, if you are intrested I would purchase this game asap before it becomes to expensive because I think this game has a great future. It is a blast in my opinion similar to Halo and Call of Duty mixed with an amazing fighting enviornment. I would ABSOLUTELY recomend this game to anyone who likes 1st person shooter games.","February 21, 2014","true","17.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's not a typical cookie cutter fps, it plays like a tactical shooter (though very limited for now, the game is still in development). Playing with your friends over a VOIP program, in the dark where only a flashlight can illuminate anything at all is a wonderful feeling, not knowing when or where you'll be attacked, not knowing if you turn around and your friend is dead at your feet; The game does an amazing job already of this, and there's till more to come!","December 7, 2014","true","25.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Like they should add in game currency so you can buy the attachments for your weapon because most of us feel that it gives us a sense of achievement in getting that item. They also should add a secondary weapon which would make it funner as there seems to be only one weapon in the game. Combat felt a bit dull but i think it still was pretty fun. They also should add Co-op like with the sharks/ legs on because that seems to be what the game is for.\nbut i think this is still a great game.\n9/10\n\nEdit:10/06/2014\nThe game just had the first co-op come out and man I got admit even though they where robots, it was dark and creepy, i hear that thump thump thump whack and i start fireing without aiming. dam its like does have a creepy feel in single player think i going to get a few friends and that may make it a lot more fun and hopefully less creepy.","March 30, 2014","true","1.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are multiple maps with envorinment settings. So you can go to one server with a map and it's raining, and as you play in the map the weather actually changes to where it'll be easier to fight, or to where it'll be harder to fight.\n\n-Weaponry/Equipment: At this time, there is only 1 weapon, which is an assault rifle. Yet, you also have the abiloity to activate a lazer for you to help with your accurasy, a flashlight incase it get's dark (game sometimes has you in pitch black darkness), of course you can zoom in by right-clicking, and unlike any sci-fi FPS, you can actually take off your visor. So it'll be like fighting with literally your own eyes. But the game doesn't give you a cursor to aim with like Halo, Battlefield, TF2, etc. You actually have to aim like everyone does in real life when in combat.\n\n-Maps: There are multiple maps that go from the middle of a swamp, to the cold regions, to a colony in the forest. All maps has the ability to change the weather to throw off players.\n\n-Game Mode: So far, there is only one game mode where you hold a certain area for the longest, but as time goes on, the capture zone will move into a different area of the map. In order to win, you must hold the capture zone for the longest when the time runs out, or when the amount of time you hold it reaches it's max. Either way, you have to work with your team in order to win. Cooperation and skill will bring you to victory in this game.\n\nOverall, this game is incredible for it to be an Early Access Game, I recommend this game to anyone that reads this.","May 7, 2014","true","5.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The reason i use this for a quick match type of game is purely because of the launch speed, and i'm on Mac for god's sake. So if you happen to be 'one of those people' that just cannot wait five seconds for a game to boot, you're covered with Interstellar Marines (i imagine when the ever growing content is updated to include campaign mode the start time won't be as brisk).\n\nFurthermore, the detail and as the developers have worked for; immersion, is superior. I have experienced no bugs what so ever and not once have i lagged during gameplay which has been excellent.\n\nYes, the game is no where near completed. Alas i like to think of this as a good thing. You can be sure your purchase was not in vain as future content is assured.\nThe sort of things to come are displayed on various Zeropoint websites including some pretty nifty videos (including the campaign 'Landsharks') and a few demonstration games to play with.\n\nSummed up, Interstellar Marines was well worth the low price despite the Early Access title.\nPurchasing the game now helps the developers create the final product, there's little to lose.\n\nMy only, only issue- in the entire game would be the reeds on one of the levels. Upon close inspection they appear to be rather pixilated. Though by saying that i am REALLY nit-picking, everything else is flawless including the rather uniquely atmospheric lighting system.\n","June 9, 2014","true","5.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've only played multiplayer, however. You are given two guns, one for close to mid-range combat, another for mid to long-range. Both guns can have silencers, flashlights, and laser sights toggled.\n\nThere aren't that many maps yet, which is super understandable, but the maps that are provided are extremely balanced. Maybe too balanced for some, but balanced nonetheless. The maps also change over the course of each round, which is extremely interesting. Platforms move up and down, rain starts to fall (muffling the sound of your footsteps), and the lighting changes. One of my favorite things about this is when the lights go out. Fighting in the dark is insanely satisfying. You never really know what's going on... but in a good way.\n\nThere's a quite a few bugs here and there, but it's in alpha. Of course there's bugs. This game has a hell of a lot of potential; it looks like it could become the FPS I've been waiting for.","February 12, 2015","true","1.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'll add more once  i have tried co-op and mp. plus i know for $6 i will get my monies worth even if it takes the devs a while to finish it.\n\nedit: im thinking checkpoints on the easiest difficulty might be nice just so you can figure out how to complete a mission without dying after 2hrs not knowing if you were close to the escape or in the entirely wrong spot, but i hear they might be coming","February 11, 2015","true","9.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The developers show that they care by using tons of detail. The enviornments change, from day to night to rain to snow in just a short match. The player has so many decisions to make when this fantastic enviornment changes, you can use a flashlight attachment to your gun, have a laser sight, open and close your helmet visor. For example, in the night you can choose to use your flashlight to find people or you can creep around in the shadows (in the dark.) Another nice feature is you can walk around the maps by yourself and get to them before challenging others. This game is early access so you can imagine there are a few turn-off's as of right now, lag, the campaign has not been added yet, and sadly as far as I know there is only 1 or 2 guns in multiplayer. Overall though I would recommend it, if you are intrested I would purchase this game asap before it becomes to expensive because I think this game has a great future. It is a blast in my opinion similar to Halo and Call of Duty mixed with an amazing fighting enviornment.

It doesn't really rely on online multiplayer team vs. team combat like most FPS nowadays. You can play singleplayer missions, co-op with a few friends, and if you really want to, you can play multiplayer. Visually, it's stunning. The effects on the visor are new to sci-fi shooters and really haven't seen that done before. I didn't get my chance to try out multiplayer against other players quite yet, and don't think I'll get the chance for a while. Although this game is fantastic, and is different from the many shooters that it's in the market against, it lacks one thing that might make this better for us, not so rich people that can't afford to buy a gaming pc. A graphics tab. It does have the v-sync, etc. stuff, but I maybe want to lower some of the quality to medium instead of always being on high. For laptop users, like myself, this is a big issue that we have to deal with. I'm not saying my laptop is terrible graphically or anything, but a graphics tab, visual quality slider could be useful to many players.

It's not. most games of that nature are linear.Go the same path every time you play. Intersellar Marines is deffinately not linear. The robots are unpredictable. They maybe here, or there or attack you if they see you.Very creepy.very imersive.it"s early access at the moment and darn good already, more to come. This game is totally different.free to roam anywhere and the enemies will follow or react to your flashlight,or lazer. it's just a great game all around, and as I said it's getting better all the time. The developers are really engaged and hard at work on some of the suggestion from the community which is also great.An experience well worth the small price of the game. i give it 10/10.","February 5, 2015","true","301.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is exciting and terrifying at times. The stealth system is very fun to utilize and it is very tactical. Some things could definetly be added though. Instead of jumping walls or fences, you should have the ability to vault over things just to make movements smoother and fluent. More weapons could absolutely be added, including additional co op and campaign missions. It gets difficult to play them over and over again. It would be nice if a co op gamemode with rounds of difficulty was added, so you have to hold out. ALso, when you pull up your mask the other player should be able to see it. A greater variety of robots would be interesting as well. A list of objectives would help when you become completely lost in a mission too.","February 14, 2015","true","22.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The single player tutorial: you're thrown into a room full of bloodthirsty androids with nothing but an SMG, an assault rifle, and whatever god you believe in. Then suddenly the lights go out, and all you can hear is the robotic hiss and footsteps of the creatures created solely to destroy you. As your heart starts rapidly beating the footsteps grow closer, you ready your gun to defend yourself... then BANG you're dead sucks you're awful at the game and now you're crying on the floor begging for your mother.

Perhaps many will say its unrealistic as there doest seem to have any variation of flight, but damn it feels good to know you as the player are on point.\n\nWhere is the game now? Well, its playable with a some bugs that are easily repeatable but nothing that breaks the game. There are 7 maps, and really it doesnt seem like much. And once you clear them all with you group of friends its hard to go back to them. And you will need friends, this game can be hard and failing is a part of it, but with a full group of friends there are alot of tactics to try in all the maps  in all the modes. It just feels like there isnt enough game yet, esp with updates so far between eachother. The online server chooser needs to be fleshed out a bit, currently a slight pain to get a game going, but not hard either, just missing some nicities.\n\nSo for me and my group, there isnt enough yet for us to buy into I.M.'s Early Access yet. BUT if an update adds the sharks and give me some LAN play, I'm all in. It just need a bit more.","February 16, 2015","true","10.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The reason i use this for a quick match type of game is purely because of the launch speed, and i'm on Mac for god's sake. So if you happen to be 'one of those people' that just cannot wait five seconds for a game to boot, you're covered with Interstellar Marines (i imagine when the ever growing content is updated to include campaign mode the start time won't be as brisk).\n\nFurthermore, the detail and as the developers have worked for; immersion, is superior. I have experienced no bugs what so ever and not once have i lagged during gameplay which has been excellent.\n\nYes, the game is no where near completed. Alas i like to think of this as a good thing. You can be sure your purchase was not in vain as future content is assured.\nThe sort of things to come are displayed on various Zeropoint websites including some pretty nifty videos (including the campaign 'Landsharks') and a few demonstration games to play with.\n\nSummed up, Interstellar Marines was well worth the low price despite the Early Access title.\nPurchasing the game now helps the developers create the final product, there's little to lose.\n\nMy only, only issue- in the entire game would be the reeds on one of the levels. Upon close inspection they appear to be rather pixilated. Though by saying that i am REALLY nit-picking, everything else is flawless including the rather uniquely atmospheric lighting system.\n","June 9, 2014","true","5.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The only thing that bothers me is its unoptimized state in which it is, but since it is in early access I'll let it slide for now.\n\nSingleplayer:\n\nBefore I installed the game I read reviews about it and saw that people got scared while playing singleplayer.\nAt first I was confused as to how a shooter with robots can be scary. Then I played the singleplayer and I understood.\nIt's pretty scary when a robot starts to run towards you. Although they may seem non-frightening, their faceless head can spook you once it randomly pops up in front of you.\n\nCo-op:\nDidn't play so I can't comment on that, sorry.\n\nMultiplayer:\nThe multiplayer for Interstellar Marines was quite fun for me actually, although in my past I played only CoD multiplayer(long time ago). To be honest it took me a little to get used to the guns(only 2 for now) and the lack of crosshair(instead you use a laser), but because of this I was forced to focus on my little tiny dot and I was sucked into the game. The game for now has a small amount of maps, but the ones that are in it currently are very well designed and I look forward to future maps. The players that I played with didn't chat alot so but the ones that did were very nice.\n\nI would recommend this game to the people who love strategic shoters as it involves alot of tactical cooperation between players, if you want to win ofcourse.\n\nAlthough I played the game while it was free for a couple of days, I will buy it as soon as I get money as it is worth the money and the wait for better optimization.","February 11, 2015","true","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've only played multiplayer, however. You are given two guns, one for close to mid-range combat, another for mid to long-range. Both guns can have silencers, flashlights, and laser sights toggled.\n\nThere aren't that many maps yet, which is super understandable, but the maps that are provided are extremely balanced. Maybe too balanced for some, but balanced nonetheless. The maps also change over the course of each round, which is extremely interesting. Platforms move up and down, rain starts to fall (muffling the sound of your footsteps), and the lighting changes. One of my favorite things about this is when the lights go out. Fighting in the dark is insanely satisfying. You never really know what's going on... but in a good way.\n\nThere's a quite a few bugs here and there, but it's in alpha. Of course there's bugs.

I'll add more once  i have tried co-op and mp. plus i know for $6 i will get my monies worth even if it takes the devs a while to finish it.\n\nedit: im thinking checkpoints on the easiest difficulty might be nice just so you can figure out how to complete a mission without dying after 2hrs not knowing if you were close to the escape or in the entirely wrong spot, but i hear they might be coming","February 11, 2015","true","9.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Neurogen Incident certainly shows this off, creating a tense co op experience.\nThe UI can be a bit cumbersome, as I understand that it's meant to be immersive it can still prove to be a pain given the amount of time a chat message appears on screen. Thus forcing you to bring up the chat menu, I'd prefer if they showed all messages from the past 5-10 seconds and slowly faded them out based on lifetime. Making the social experience a bit less frustrating.\nSomething to be noted is the gunplay is not like anything I've experienced it's hard to describe really any other way than it feeling like you're controlling something and it has a considerable latency. Keep in mind my setup has no latency issues monitor is 1ms response time graphics card is more than capable... etc. Not to mention in the game's current state the community is quite small, it's hard to keep an audience's attention when you have such little content to show for, regardless of the content's magnitude.\n\nAll this taken into consideration also with the fact that this game is still early access, the game is quite unique and definitely delivers an FPS experience unlike anything else I have had. I'd certainly recommend this to a friend who was looking for a basic and immersive tactical FPS for PC.\n","December 2, 2014","true","4.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mitemaximus/recommended/236370/","mitemaximus","Abraham Drinkin'","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mitemaximus/","97 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game has some amazing potential. Despite the (current) lack of content, the dev team has already nailed the atmosphere of Dead Space cross Rainbow Six , with some surprisingly immersive gameplay and gorgeous graphics from the Unity Engine. Your player character is very human-slow, vulnerable, and brave. Teamwork is just as important as twitch reflexes and awareness of your enviroment, and while the game can be played alone it is difficult and boring without at least someone else by your side. The game currently fearures a decent Multiplayer experience, several solo challenge missions, and two epic story missions pitting you and a team of 3 others up against intelligent and dangerous training robots simulating events from the IM backstory. While many features such as more guns (currently only 2), missions, and enemies (Land Sharks), the game feels balanced and very well done. According to the devs, this has been tehir life's dream for almost 20 years now, and they are very unlikely to give up and leave this as vaporware. The one complaint I have is the development cycle: with only 12 people building the equivalent of a AAA-quality title, it takes several months to update the content. If you're willing to wait, gab the game and start playing-realistic difficulty is hard and takes a lot of cooperation and skill to complete, so don't excpet to be bored. And if it feels too risky, keep an eye on Interstella Marines-this game is going places.","February 14, 2015","true","4.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The concept of the game its actually pretty good, trying to figure out what was the character doing there though, it doesnt really tells anything about that, but I'll give them some time to think that. No crosshair, soft movements in the gun while moving the camera, makes it very realistic, and the atmosphere its awesome, the darkness and the fight against the training robots made me feel scared as f*ck, and I loved it. I would say its a game you should buy as quick as possible, but its an Early Access, so, we'll leave it to that, before you buy it you should wait until the game it's out. The graphics are great, not the best ones, but hey, you gotta admit that they are not bad. There are almost no graphic options, apart from the quality of the shadows and some view quality options (Depht of field, etc) , and that its disapointing.

Perhaps many will say its unrealistic as there doest seem to have any variation of flight, but damn it feels good to know you as the player are on point.\n\nWhere is the game now? Well, its playable with a some bugs that are easily repeatable but nothing that breaks the game. There are 7 maps, and really it doesnt seem like much. And once you clear them all with you group of friends its hard to go back to them. And you will need friends, this game can be hard and failing is a part of it, but with a full group of friends there are alot of tactics to try in all the maps  in all the modes. It just feels like there isnt enough game yet, esp with updates so far between eachother. The online server chooser needs to be fleshed out a bit, currently a slight pain to get a game going, but not hard either, just missing some nicities.\n\nSo for me and my group, there isnt enough yet for us to buy into I.M.'s Early Access yet.

The reason i use this for a quick match type of game is purely because of the launch speed, and i'm on Mac for god's sake. So if you happen to be 'one of those people' that just cannot wait five seconds for a game to boot, you're covered with Interstellar Marines (i imagine when the ever growing content is updated to include campaign mode the start time won't be as brisk).\n\nFurthermore, the detail and as the developers have worked for; immersion, is superior. I have experienced no bugs what so ever and not once have i lagged during gameplay which has been excellent.\n\nYes, the game is no where near completed. Alas i like to think of this as a good thing. You can be sure your purchase was not in vain as future content is assured.\nThe sort of things to come are displayed on various Zeropoint websites including some pretty nifty videos (including the campaign 'Landsharks') and a few demonstration games to play with.\n\nSummed up, Interstellar Marines was well worth the low price despite the Early Access title.\nPurchasing the game now helps the developers create the final product, there's little to lose.\n\nMy only, only issue- in the entire game would be the reeds on one of the levels. Upon close inspection they appear to be rather pixilated. Though by saying that i am REALLY nit-picking, everything else is flawless including the rather uniquely atmospheric lighting system.\n","June 9, 2014","true","5.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Honestly the reason I only played as little as I did was because it was a lot scarier than what I expected. I know that may sound childish but seriously, it was freaking terrifying. The single player tutorial: you're thrown into a room full of bloodthirsty androids with nothing but an SMG, an assault rifle, and whatever god you believe in. Then suddenly the lights go out, and all you can hear is the robotic hiss and footsteps of the creatures created solely to destroy you. As your heart starts rapidly beating the footsteps grow closer, you ready your gun to defend yourself... then BANG you're dead sucks you're awful at the game and now you're crying on the floor begging for your mother.

The only thing that bothers me is its unoptimized state in which it is, but since it is in early access I'll let it slide for now.\n\nSingleplayer:\n\nBefore I installed the game I read reviews about it and saw that people got scared while playing singleplayer.\nAt first I was confused as to how a shooter with robots can be scary. Then I played the singleplayer and I understood.\nIt's pretty scary when a robot starts to run towards you. Although they may seem non-frightening, their faceless head can spook you once it randomly pops up in front of you.\n\nCo-op:\nDidn't play so I can't comment on that, sorry.\n\nMultiplayer:\nThe multiplayer for Interstellar Marines was quite fun for me actually, although in my past I played only CoD multiplayer(long time ago). To be honest it took me a little to get used to the guns(only 2 for now) and the lack of crosshair(instead you use a laser), but because of this I was forced to focus on my little tiny dot and I was sucked into the game. The game for now has a small amount of maps, but the ones that are in it currently are very well designed and I look forward to future maps. The players that I played with didn't chat alot so but the ones that did were very nice.\n\nI would recommend this game to the people who love strategic shoters as it involves alot of tactical cooperation between players, if you want to win ofcourse.\n\nAlthough I played the game while it was free for a couple of days, I will buy it as soon as I get money as it is worth the money and the wait for better optimization.","February 11, 2015","true","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is exciting and terrifying at times. The stealth system is very fun to utilize and it is very tactical. Some things could definetly be added though. Instead of jumping walls or fences, you should have the ability to vault over things just to make movements smoother and fluent. More weapons could absolutely be added, including additional co op and campaign missions. It gets difficult to play them over and over again. It would be nice if a co op gamemode with rounds of difficulty was added, so you have to hold out. ALso, when you pull up your mask the other player should be able to see it. A greater variety of robots would be interesting as well.

If one wants to know how far this game has come, check out videos of the original release vs the current game version (Update 18 for the time this review was written).\n\nIn terms of gameplay, here is what players can expect to see (As of Update 18):\n\nSolid gunplay mechanics. the weapon's sights aren't "glued" to your screen, and will move around as you walk, fire, etc. (Think kind of like Red Orchestra). The weapon does reset at the centre of your screen however.\n\nA stamina system that affects your character's accuracy as he gets tired. Stamina is drained when jogging, sprinting, and jumping. You can hear your character's breathing and when your HUD is offline, his breath will fog up the inside of the helmet.\n\nAn intuitive crouching system that allows you to change stance between a low crouch or a higher stance to shoot over low walls. Aiming down sights will also make your character peek over cover, and if you change stance while aiming, he will only bend at the knees for faster movement.\n\nSprint, Jog, and walk. Three movement speeds that are very useful and easy to cycle through.\n\nTwo weapons. An Assault Rifle for long range combat and an SMG for close range combat.\n\nThe ability to attach a sound suppressor to your weapon. It actually works really well in both multiplayer and co-op/single player\n\nYou can shoot out lights to create darkness in order to sneak around (Think Metro 2033/ Last Light)\n\nMultiplayer maps will change time of day, weather, and sometimes layout as you play. Matches have a sense of unpredictability for newcomers because of this.\n\nThree game modes to chose from: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, and Domination.\n\n3 campaign missions, and a few other side-missions. Currently, all missions are training excercises for your character (A new recruit to the Interstellar Marines).\n\nHUD deactivates when you take 50% damage. This makes it hard to identify between friend and foe because IFF markers and objective markers all vanish.\n\n\nI hope that this review has convinced at least one person to try out the game. Despite all the praise I'm throwing at it, note that there are many missing features in the game. The updates have been coming in more quickly recently, and a big one is apparently going to be coming in soon. So if you feel like taking a risk and betting on this extremely promising title, I highly suggest that you buy it. If you can, go for the spearhead edition to get a few extra goodies.\n\n","March 2, 2015","true","256.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Even if you buy it now and don't like it, which you would have to be crazy not to, this will be an investment. Simply because Interstellar marines is a game to watch, with a ton of future potential and that future isn't far off.\n\nThe game, as it is, puts you in the boots of a Marine undergoing training in preperation for combat missions that will take you to the furthest reaches of human expansion in the universe that will lead to first contact with other intelligent life in a very realisitc way.\n\nThe developers are fantastic, dedicated, imaginative and have in my opinion (and I know this is a review) have given to us as customers the most brilliant concept for a game I can concieve espically the way they have implemented dynamic environments.\nWhen the lights are on you walk about like you own the place but the dark corners you still avoid, when they go out completely you hide in the corners edging along walls frightened to turn on your flash light because the dark just seems so vast because when all the lights go out it really is pitch black and the dark feels real.\nThe weather is also diverse with rain that falls on your visor obscuring your vision really giving you a sense of presense and depth like no other game offers.\n\nThe weapons feel like tools of war rather than cap guns, the sounds of your boots on the floor make you concentrate on moving forward, the only sound this game is missing to make you feel alive is the sound of your heart beating but then you might be able to hear it but I could not over the sound of my own.\n\nThe graphics are impressive when you can see and when you can not. If you look outide at the stars you get a sense of loneliness that not many games give you that take you to space but that might have something to do with what is waiting for you inside. The jungle like environment on one map even though it covers only one half of the map is amazing with a great sense of being in a real life jungle which at times is like being in the dark because all you see is different shades of green.\n\nThe AI is the best I have ever experienced, even when compared to arma because the AI in interstellar marines is way more intelligent they react to light, the environment and when they are fired upon. If you are standing on a catwalk and shoot down at them they will seek cover out of view, taking you by surprise when you are forced to go down and deal with them. The dev's even said they would rather have one intelligent AI than several dumb ones which should give you an even better idea of how good they are.\n\nSo ISM is simply the most dynamic, believeable and suspenseful experiences you will hopefully ever feel in a FPS all while being a beautiful game with an almost perfect community and development team!\n\nThumbs up with a well desevered recommendation and big thank you to Zero Point software for such a brilliant game.","November 3, 2014","true","13.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have re-done my review and decided to spend a few minutes re-writing it.\n\nI found I.M one day looking for a game. I bought it, Played it, and enjoyed it. And I kept coming back for more. I was just a small fish in a big pond. Look at me now, after around 2 years of I.M somehow I managed to join 2 Oceanic competitive clans, won four clan compition matches, won 5-6 Hell Weeks and created the biggest and coolest unofficial game mode there is... "Hide 'n Go Taze".\n\nCo-op is solid so far and enjoyable with mates and by yourself if you want to practise. Multiplayer is so much fun if you get to know people and know what you are doing. I would reccomend making a few friends buy this game and play Multiplayer with you as it may be dead sometimes during the day.\n\nHell Week is a lot of fun. Better than it used to be now that CTR's and supply drops were added. Devs are good listeners and care about what they do. They actually confess if they mucked something up or did something wrong, which gets them respect in my book.\n\nNow after this read, hopefully I convinced you to buy this little gem. Go taze some fellow marines in the face.\n\n(The bushes are STILL bulletproof)","May 26, 2014","true","217.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Tactical shooters seem to have passed into history and games like the Rainbow Six series have no equals in today's gaming landscape. Interstellar Marines is an admirable attempt to ressurect this genre and is absolutely brimming with potential. In it's current state the game is lacking in both content and polish. There's a few weapons, a handful of maps and some single player content that feels like a tutorial. There are no real tactical options yet and simple features like peeking around a corner are lacking. Still the game is an absolute thrill to play. I found myself holding my breath while sneaking through a futuristic compound, listening for robotic footsteps and checking every corner. The game is every better when played in co-op mode. Interstellar Marines has a long way to go to become a complete and finished project but the potential is there.\n\nPRO's:\n- True TFPS atmosphere\n- Movement and shooting feel rigid\n- Fun co-op and Versus Multiplayer\n\nCON's:\n- Inconsistent performance\n- Incosistent level of polish\n- Overall lack of conent","February 10, 2015","true","6.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is exciting and terrifying at times. The stealth system is very fun to utilize and it is very tactical. Some things could definetly be added though. Instead of jumping walls or fences, you should have the ability to vault over things just to make movements smoother and fluent. More weapons could absolutely be added, including additional co op and campaign missions. It gets difficult to play them over and over again. It would be nice if a co op gamemode with rounds of difficulty was added, so you have to hold out. ALso, when you pull up your mask the other player should be able to see it. A greater variety of robots would be interesting as well. A list of objectives would help when you become completely lost in a mission too.","February 14, 2015","true","22.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The controls are fine, and the game dynamics are generally pretty great. One thing I didn't like was the lack of a objective reviewer or mini-map of somesort. When the next objective is relayed to you by voice, that is the only time you will be briefed on what you should do. If you failed to hear it, well, tough luck. You'll have to guess your way to the next objective.\n\nThe different game modes are amusing enough. Elimination and coop provide extra entertainment and even the single player campaigns are worth playing through. The Neurogen episode is a particular favorite, as it incoroporates a certain horror element into the game. Everything is generally pitch black and you are left with just your torch to guide you through much of the game. But the best part is the psychotic androids which have gone berserk and are running around aimlessly throughout the corridors and rooms of the space ship. The sound effects help greatly, to instill a tiny sense of fear, mainly of the 'unknown'. The footsteps of the androids seem frantic at times and hearing them improved the atmosphere. When the androids see you they often run off to hide behind something and wait for you to come closer. Then they charge you with everything they have. It's great.","February 12, 2015","true","25.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I played it for a bit with my mate, after getting the spearhead edition for cheap and two keys, we only played multiplayer and was fun for a while. After an hour I got a bit bored becuase it was very slow paced considering the amount of players (4). But with these new updates, I have to say, it might be the best horror experience I've played. It's not intended to be a horror, at least I don't think so, but may I say this game is incredible for that. Playing the neurogen experience for the first time with my friend, we we're both shaking by the end and loved absolutely every second. Hearing a robot in the next room means any loud actions and you're done. The robots spriting at you is incredibly tense and makes me too scared to go around the next corner!!!\n\nFor a fantastic tactical FPS game with a group of friends, a singleplayer horror experience or a visceral co-op game to hear your friends scream over skype, this game is perfect for you.\n\n9/10","January 17, 2015","true","14.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

However, based on what the devolpers have planned and how frequently the updates are coming along I think it will be a good game in the long run. Let's get to the Pro's and Con's of the game so far. {I PLAN TO UPDATE IT}\n\n===PRO===\n1. The game looks great and runs great, even on some of the lowest settings. The enviroment changes really do add to the combat experience.\n2. Immersion. The devolpers have been trying to make this game really immersive, and they really have. The rain on the helmet, the ambient sounds, everything about the immersion is great. Once the Oculus Rift support for this game arrives, this will be a MUST-OWN for anyone with an Oculus Rift\n3. Planned features. This may not seem like a real Pro, but the features the developers want to add sound great. Land Sharks, need I say more?\n\n===CON===\n1. Only one gun. Gets very boring using the same gun (THOUGH IT IS IN ALPHA, AN EARLY ALPHA). No sidearms, no melee, just your one SMG.\n2. No hit markers, and the gun feels like it does no damage. Kinda feels like shooting at ghosts until they fall over.\n3. Only 2 gamemodes (yet again, it's early alpha) Free For All (feels like CoD with one gun) and Team Domination. Team Domination is great mode because it forces teams to work together to hold areas. Sometimes however...\n4. TEAM KILLING! Your team mates are only marked with little blue lights. Sometimes it can be hard to see if someones on your team, exspecially if they open fire on you.\n\nNot gonna rant on how there's no melee or crouching yet in the game, because, once more, it's EARLY ALPHA!\n\nIn short, Interstellar Marines in it's current state isn't great, but hopefully in a few months it will be well worth the $15.\n","January 24, 2014","true","7.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

While it does operate akin to a long-term beta test, providing a customer base with an opportunity to give direct feedback and guide a game’s development, I feel uncomfortable with the need for financial outlay – particularly when a game can take a good many years to put together, running the risk of developers losing interest and moving on to other things.\n\nAlthough set to feature a single player and co-op campaign comprised of four distinct acts, telling the story of man’s first contact with sentient life, all that’s been produced over the past nine years are four proof-of-concept demos and a mission entitled The NeuroGen Incident. Being a small outfit that, at this point in time is predominantly crowdfunded, it’s unclear whether the game will ever reach the high bar it’s set itself.\n\nBased on my short playthrough of the NeuroGen mission, however, I very much hope it does.\n\nNARRATIVE\nWithout any backstory, the mission drops you on un-named ship somewhere out in the depths of space. Everything around you is bathed in darkness, leaving you dependent on your torch’s narrow beam of light to navigate your way into the bowels of the ship and get the power up and running.\nThe mission itself is simple: to retrieve some research data and destroy all records. Although it’s unclear what the research is or why it needs to be destroyed, there are some strong Weyland-Yutani vibes -- of people in power having meddled in things they don’t fully understand.\nScrambling around in the darkness, crawling through claustrophobic air ducts, trying to bring the ship back to life, faint sounds of movement begin to echo all around you and a tense atmosphere begins to develop, the ship empty, apparently abandoned without warning but for the perpetual movement of faceless androids concealed within a shadowy labyrinth of tunnels.\nIt’s unclear whether they are friend or foe, showing little to no notice of you whatsoever provided you keep your distance. Antagonise them, however, and you have to act immediately. These things are fast, unpredictable and deadly. Think of the anthropomorphic androids from I, Robot and you’re pretty much there. You never know when they’re going to come for you, but when they do, you’d better be ready. They really are terrifying.\n\nThe ambiance for this mission was completely spot on in my book, and left me on edge throughout the entire playthough. It really did take me back to the first third of the very first Half Life game, venturing unaccompanied into a dangerous unknown, trying to piece together events for which you have only the smallest fragments of information. Stuff the co-op option, playing this thing alone is definitely the way to go.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nI’ve seen people complain that the androids themselves are too powerful, killing you in just one or two hits. In my view, this is exactly how this kind of game should be. It makes them dangerous, puts you on the back foot, forces you to be cautious and plan your movements. Run and gun this ♥♥♥♥ and you’re in for a bad time.\n\nAs for guns, in my playthrough, all you have available is the very sub-machine gun you start off with. Now, some people might bemoan being unable to pick from hundreds of different shotguns and rocket launchers, with the developers themselves planning to eventually release 27 different weapons, but I liked the simplicity of it. The situation will no doubt change as new levels and environments get added, but on a small and enclosed ship, there was no need for anything more. And, as daft as it sounds playing a sci-fi video game, it added to the realism of the thing and maintained a pervasive feeling of vulnerability.\n\nVISUALS\nThe visuals themselves are nothing special, but they don’t have to be. I’m a firm believer that, if the narrative and gameplay are sound, how a game looks should have very little do with your enjoyment of a game. That was very much the case here. After getting sucked in, creeping panicked around corners, inching deeper and deeper into the ship, the last thing on my mind was the lack of high-res textures and dynamic lighting and advanced particle effects.\n\nFUTURE DEVELOPMENT\nTwo points of note I will make regarding future development: first, when riding platforms that move vertically, the player’s character bobs up and down, as though clipping in and out of the platform’s floor. I’ve even seen mention elsewhere of people falling right through these platforms, so definitely looks like something the developers need to take a look at. In addition, the game seems to be pretty poorly optimised at present. Although I don’t have the fastest gaming PC in the world, the game was averaging around 15 FPS for much of my playthrough.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\nThose issues aside, this game was a very pleasant surprise. Though short and still far from finished, this small little taster holds a lot of promise. If the developers stick to their guns and play this right, Interstellar Marines could will be a worthwhile successor to System Shock. Watch this space and cross your fingers.","October 17, 2014","true","0.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This game has the potential to become amazing in every way and could easily stand up to the bigger games like CoD and BF (Battlefield) and make them question their own games worth. This game currently is in Alpha and already impressed me off the back. The maps are nothing flashy, but look beautiful and play great. The combat system is quick and fast, meaning that getting the right shot in your small window of time matters A LOT. The maps are dynamic in the sense of visuals. The sky changes from a beautiful day to pitch black night. Thunderstorms and cloudy weather happen a lot too making you always re-thinking your steps when the new weather kicks in. The game isn't ready to stand up to bigger FPS but it is getting there. This is a game where I highly reccomend you get the Spearhead Eddition right off the back and I reccommend this to anyone who wants a fun new FPS fresh off the market to play.","August 13, 2013","true","5.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

It's mostly a quick paced run n' gun game right now. You get one weapon, infinite ammo, and with no jump or crouch at the moment, sprinting and trying to strafe yourself out of harms way is the norm right now.\n\nThough later the game is going to a larger variety of weapons, realistic features (such as helmet malfunction), and the basics of crouch and jump.\n\nThe game is a simulation of what is may be like to be a marine in a far off future. The marines hud is well designed and can be brought up, which puts your hearing at a disadvantage. They also have some pretty hand gear that can be attached or taken off in the heat of battle, such as a laser and flashlight. Though, I believe the neatest feature of the game is it's changing levels. During gameplay the level will change through several different evironmental effects. For instance, in a marsh, it will be sunny, then a fog may come down, then it may turn to night. Night in this game is very dark. Your flashlight is actually usefull for the purpose of running around otherwise complete darkness.\n\nThere are also going to be a few courses to train the marines. Bullseye and running man are two that are going to come to the live game in time. For now, these two game modes are on the official site.\n\n\nAs a conclusion, I think Interstellar marines is worth the 15 dollar price tag. For a game that still has so far to go, it's a fun time even in it's current state. The game will increase in price as it is furthur developed, so even if you're unsure, grabbing it while it is at it's cheapest may be a good idea.","July 21, 2013","true","64.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Everything goes dark except your hud lights and small blue arrows, indicating your allies. Some fluorescent tape on the containers strained in the hallway. You lift your helmet and look around you. You hear distant footsteps and beeping of the computers. You breath deeply and flick your flashlight for a second. A slight movement startles you. As you lower your helmet, you are assecured that that is indeed your friend, your guide in this blue, subtle darkness that engulfs your field of view, and forces you to scout your surroundings. Was that an enemy or a lone wire? Was that a footstep or a drop of water from the sterile, metal ceiling? Suddenly, you hear gunfire, not so distant but not too close. You rush towards the sound and you are greeted with a grim reminder that you have enemies, and their hands are faster than yours. You spray bullets on their shiny costumes and boom, bam, tak!

Right now, it's a wonderful hardcore shooter that needs to be upgraded. These devs understand what gamers want in a space FPS and seem to be very inspired by good shooters (HL2, System Shock 2) and good space movies (Alien, Old Star Trek).

For example Alarms going off and the only light you see is comming from the rotating caution lights. Its Super creepy playing online and I noticed my heart beat racing from time to time with the sheer jumpy-ness.\n\nHighly recommend for what this game could be and from the looks of the video one that might in future support the occulus rift!

I played it for a bit with my mate, after getting the spearhead edition for cheap and two keys, we only played multiplayer and was fun for a while. After an hour I got a bit bored becuase it was very slow paced considering the amount of players (4). But with these new updates, I have to say, it might be the best horror experience I've played. It's not intended to be a horror, at least I don't think so, but may I say this game is incredible for that. Playing the neurogen experience for the first time with my friend, we we're both shaking by the end and loved absolutely every second. Hearing a robot in the next room means any loud actions and you're done. The robots spriting at you is incredibly tense and makes me too scared to go around the next corner!!!\n\nFor a fantastic tactical FPS game with a group of friends, a singleplayer horror experience or a visceral co-op game to hear your friends scream over skype, this game is perfect for you.\n\n9/10","January 17, 2015","true","14.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

With big artificial arenas. (But you knew that, right?)\n\nThe game touts itself as scifi. All that is scifi about it is the looks, it's not even half a believable world as Halflife was. Door switches, but no light switches. Nuff said. And everything is basically empty or a storage room. It's Early Access, they say.\n\nI've been trying out the solo "campaign" = disjointed missions. The tutorial has the full range of glitches, from rocks clipping through walls in the station to falling through the scenery and bots that can't find doors (but keep running against the wall anyway) and that in "realistic" mode seem to score more teamkills than I do kills (ok, some people might argue that _is_ realistic). And the bot sometimes see you (and shoot you) when you're standing still and crouched in the dark. Or disappear if seen through a door when they're in plain sight and 30m away.\n\nThe levels are clearly made for co-op. They're not randomized (every keycard is where it was the last time), and if the AI shoots you, you must restart the whole mission (in co-op, there's spectator mode for you). Nice, huh? Forget immersion, you're traversing an arena, and you know it. The walls are paper thin so you can hear the bots moving next door."Reinforcements" come from who-knows-where, nobody ever notices a body lying around, you can be sneaky but the silenced gun will bring them running anyway much of the time (I wish I had Tomb Raider's bow & arrow), and when you stand still a while, you often get a bout of hyperventilation as if you had just exerted yourself. I guess it's best to not play the sniper - can't lie prone anyway. Did I mention there aren't any light switches? You can shoot out the lights, but some of them will turn back on when the weather changes. If you're doing co-op against the AI, you're going to have the same sort of fun that I had in solo.\n\nAt all that, it plays more like Slenderman gone fps. The enemies are a threat because you can hear them, because they come at you from the shadows, because they hit you from afar and kill you in a random careless moment. They often seem to know where you are, and that usually draws them out, unless their Artificial Stupidity pathing fails to find the door. At least it's a fair kind of Slenderman - one that you can shoot as it shoots you.\n\nSo, yeah, fps isn't my genre, and after seeing the tutorial I still set this at "realistic" (the highest difficulty) in the hopes the AI would be challenging then, and they definitely are. Unlike most other fps that I played, this game is not "holy cow, how many bullets does it take to kill that thing", it is "where the dickens did that come from" and then the mission restarts. I can see where they want to turn these robots into aliens later (and how that would raise their rating to where this could never be a "free week" game).\n\nSo do I like this game? After it beat my ♥♥♥ last night, I didn't, but today I think, it's different, it's original, and I feel challenged to beat this game, as much as I hate the interiors and the fact that the everyone in it shoots better than me. There's got to be a way to balance this with experience and smarts.\n\n"Easy" should really give you a minimap (Descent had a nice 3D minimap, so it's been done) and a radar instead of dumbing the bots down, though. And a silent weapon. I'd definitely enjoy that.","February 14, 2015","true","7.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Especially for early access games there should always be a free weekend if for nothing else but to simply let people try the game in the current state.\n\nBut in addition to that, and regarding the comment about it being the stupidest decision, all I can say is that steam seems to promote some games and burry others. The fact that this one got a whole free week was a great boost for them I am sure. Hopefully this boost will push the development to the next level, and hopefully the devs can add some critical features to the game and address some of the issues which I will outline below.\n\nAfter playing the game for most of the free week I have the following observations in no particular order:\n\nCharacter Control – overall as good as can be expected with the exception of jumping. Your player just feels weighted down. Maybe this is intended, but I found myself frustrated with the lack of fluidity and height in the jump. I would like to see it be where you can jump over some of the cover items in the game such as the concrete barriers and such. And do this in the heat of combat. As it is now, it’s just not very natural feeling and cumbersome. Because of this I rarely even use jump in the game.\n\nGameplay – A nice variety of mission types with some interesting features. First time I played on a level where the entire area had parts that would raise and lower opening new paths and blocking pervious paths it gave me pause and I had to stop for a minute to marvel at it. Makes for some very tough tactical situations. I like the elimination missions in coop the most, but once you play them a few times it gets stale as you learn where many of the bots spawn from and quickly develop a strategy to beating them, alone or as a team. Not much else in the game at the moment other than bots and not sure if this is by design or because it’s simply not implemented yet but you have infinite ammo. Still have to reload, but you never run out. Still looking for the role play and rainbow-6 tactical elements, but maybe it’s too early for that stuff. The stealth element seems to work well for the most part. Stay low and in the shadows and the bots seem to overlook you. Fire your weapon without a silencer and they will come running to your position. The bots also can home in on you by spotting your flashlight and laser pointer, so you need to know when to use them and when not to.\n\nCoop – This is the area that I would really like to see improved the most. I have two major complaints here. 1) absolutely no recourse for griefers and during the time I have played there have been many, many little sh!ts that have nothing better to do than to f-up your game. That and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥s who want to come in and hijack the server you are playing on. I know they said this is coming but come on, at least give us a group kick vote option or something in the meantime. 2) coop needs more elements to encourage team work. As of now, you get no points for reviving a teammate and communication is terrible. The few people who I have heard using a mic it was terrible, and chat totally blows. Why would you make your chat screen have to be opened with a key press and then cover the entire field of view? The chat interface needs a complete overhaul and we need team quick commands. That would be a good start to making it more tactical. If they want to do something original, give us hand signal animations that we can map to the number keys or something. That would really make stealth tactical. I would also like to see a post-game summary. As of now, when the mission is done, you don't get to see anything.\n\nLevels - Some people complained about how dark some of the levels are. Yes it’s dark and in some cases I think they take it to the extreme, but it definitely makes the levels interesting and challenging in some cases. I hope the light balancing will be tweaked to be more fun and less frustrating in some cases, but over all its not terrible. The bots don’t like it either; it makes it harder to see you!\n\nContent – Aside from the static décor and the bots there’s really nothing else in the game yet. There are interactive doors, some power switches you need to turn on for some missions and lights that you can shoot out. I hope things are added such as ammo, first aid items, of course different weapons, and the typical things you would expect in a shooter. Oh and there is also some background chatter on the intercom, as well as a female voice that gives you some mission instructions from time to time. Interesting to note, it seems like some of the intercom chatter might be alluding to events we might actually see in the finished game. That would be cool.\n\nWeapons – As many people have already said, the weapons that are in the game are pretty good, handle well and cover long range and CQB combat. Nothing special here.\n\nAll in all the game has potential. I have heard that it has been in development for a long time, something like 2 years, so it seems to be going slow. I hope the pace picks up. I do recommend the game if you like the genre and the setting, but I’m not gonna go full fantard and try to convince you that they have all these fabulous features planned all you have to do is wait for it. I really don’t know what’s going to come of this game, but while it’s on sale, why not. I am sure I, as well as you, have wasted more on less so give it a shot… maybe the extra cash will help them realize the potential of this game.","February 14, 2015","true","27.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It changes everything. Suddenly the rain is teaming down, thudding off the helmet of your suit, meaning that running suddenly becomes viable, your loud footsteps masked by the sound of the rain. As the simulation changes again the rain might stop, but the light might abandon you. When it does players are forced to use flashlights for navigation, but open themselves, and their locations, up to attack.\n\nIt’s this single mindedness that marks Interstellar Marines out as more than just a standard first person shooter. This doesn’t feel like a game that is going to ♥♥♥ superfluous nonsense to it to draw in a crowd of Call of Duty gamers. Granted, not doing so could be detrimental to the game’s sales, but, as with the game itself, sticking to their guns and being deliberate in both message and content could attract a dedicated and loyal base.\n\nhttp://www.coffeebreakgaming.co.uk/pc-games/early-access-investigations-interstellar-marines/","February 11, 2015","true","5.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

That is the easiest way to put it. You get into two team into a battlefield/arena. And similar to counterstrike you have one life. The exception to this one life rule is you can respawn in 200+ seconds or capture a point. The round is usually over in two minutes (with the exception of games that go backwards and forwards) so the only way to really give you team an advantage is to capture the points.\n\nWhat else is great about this game?\n\nOne of my favourite things about it in the day/night cycles and lighting. Most maps outside have a day and night cycle which changes how you have to play. It's to dark to see anything so you have to use a flashlight but the enemy can pinpoint where you are from the flashlight. You have to play stealthily other wise it's gameover. This goes the same for lazer pointers in daytime. Indoor maps usually have three modes. The light are on normally, There is a red alarm or there are no lights. I find these all brilliant features which change the way you play every now and then.\n\nAnd extra thing that i like about this game!\n\nWell the fact the developers put the time and effort into letting you be able to take your mask off is amazing. It is a little feature but it is great fun when a couple of friends and i jump into an empty lobby and take your mask off. It has given us a few laughs like *friendly Fire* and *lucky shots* This game just keeps me coming back for more.\n\nThe minor thing about this game is the population of it. You will occasionally find a full lobby and a couble of half lobbies but the rest of it is dead. The main reason for that is probably early access and I hope the population grows.\n\n(I probably missed some stuff out in this review.. I apologize)\n\nIn the end I give this game a 9/10 It is great fun. especially with friends!","April 5, 2015","true","4.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Ever been bothered by predictable A.I, or games that are 'set in their ways?' Up to now, there has been little predictability in this game, which makes it the most interesting shooter I have ever played. Camping means countermeasures by very intelligent A.I.'s, which work together constantly to close in on their target: You! Which means you must do everything you can to convince them you are not there. If one cannot learn to work as a team and understand how much communication, routine, persistance, adaptation and covering each other is needed, well, the adversary does! And that is just part one of this still developing game, which is promising indeed. Up 'till now, I have only played against the Combat Robots. You will fear them. You will grow to hate them. Their sound, look and zombie-like behaviour. That's ok, they really seem to hate organic intelligence too. You will thoroughly enjoy gunning down each and every one of them, which is another thing you have in common with them. In fact, it doesn't feel right to leave one standing. Even though you are a badass marine, somehow you will understand and appreciate a certain BeeGee's -song. You will scream, you will run, and you will cry, which is why this game is best played with friends in CO-OP. After all, aren't friends the people you share laughter, despair and your vulnerabilities with? And just to be clear, this game is not for people who believe in 'health-bars', cool guns vs. effective guns, or fair game. You're the game. Fair enough. This will make you experience the future of shooter games. Because that is exactly what it is. That, and the end of noobism.","January 1, 2015","true","119.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Don't get me wrong. Like all games in existence, this game has it's fair share of problems. You really can't expect much from a game that's currently in alpha, or pretty much ANY game at all since every game as I've stated before has their own set of issues.\n\nAs of right now, the game is very lackluster and barebones, but again, you really can't expect too much from an alpha, so have caution if you're expecting this game to give you a lot because as of right now, there's not too much for this game to offer at the moment in it's current stage considering it's an early access title.\n\nAnother issue I've come across, which I'm still confused on determining what exactly the issue is that's causing this. Regardless, hit detection is another issue (when I'm not in U.S. servers). Any combination of these three reasons could be the cause: Netcode issue, tickrate issue, server location. But again, since it IS an alpha title, I can't really expect it to be perfect considering this game has been in the works slowly for the past decade, which definitely tells you how much the developers care if they're taking their time to perfect their game.\n\nOne other issue is engine optimization. The graphics, while great, are also very simple, and with simple graphics, I shouldn't be having such huge FPS fluxuations with my FPS dropping as low as 10 FPS at times. Now, the prototypes of the different game modes on the official Interstellar Marines website (especially Bullseye, which ran at a solid 60 FPS for me) looks, sounds, plays, and runs much better than what we currently have on Steam (again, alpha stage, you can't really expect much) which tells me that they're probably taking the DayZ route of things and most likely going to change engines in the future to a more optimized, a more playable engine. Again, it's an alpha. Not only is this game an alpha, but Zero Point Software is an independant game development company. You gotta start somewhere. Gotta be patient with this one considering how careful the devs are being and how delicate they're treating this game. Obviously, this game still has a lot of work to be done, but it's still great nonetheless for an alpha. Pretty much, most of the issues we're seeing currently is due to it's alpha status, which really NO game as an alpha or even a beta can avoid. It's just part of early access games and development. It's natural and it takes time.\n\nRegardless, the game is great, and the prototypes of the different game modes on the official Interstellar Marines website are also fantastic as well, which pretty much gives you a taste or a hint of what's to come with this game in the future.\n\nAlthough this game has been in development since 2004, I'd rather a game take 10 years to develop just so it can be perfect and up to it's full potential as opposed to having a broken game released to me that clearly isn't finished yet *coughcoughBADCOMPANY2coughcoughCALLOFDUTYcoughcoughBATTLEFIELD4*.\n\nWith that being said, I'd really suggest supporting Zero Point Software as much as possible considering they've been busting their asses off for the past 10 years just to dish out a good game, and that right there tells you that these developers take this seriously and pour every ounce of their tears and blood into this game.\n\nGet this game. If not now as an pre alpha, get it as a full release when it's finally complete.\n\nUPDATE: As of now, many of these issues I mentioned earlier have been resolved by the devs, all the more reason to get this game seeing as the devs actually give a ♥♥♥♥ about their game.","July 26, 2014","true","96.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
