Perhaps it was the side effect of being an overweight, socially awkward kid without any friends, or part of a larger psychological disorder that was never diagnosed, but either way it made day to day life immensely stressful and difficult. Emotional meltdowns were common, and anything unexpected usually sent me into a downward spiral that sometimes took days to crawl out of. This of course extended to my creative endeavors, which no matter how much time I poured into them I never felt confident they were good enough, or that I could show anyone else for fear of ridicule.\n\nSo when Estaban the bull breaks down in tears because to him his art never feels acceptable, I can relate. He might be a cartoon with a simplified version of anxiety, but his lack of confidence in the things he makes is something myself and almost everyone creative I know suffers from, but is rarely brought up in any sort of media. That alone made his journey in Slow Down, Bull to find the perfect decorations for his art, but more importantly to become empowered by it, something meaningful to me, even more so given its kid friendly aesthetic and accessible design.\n\nHere was a game for kids and adults alike letting us know that it’s OK if something doesn’t turn out perfect, and that the stress you feel when sharing it with others is almost always unfounded. It’s the sort of reassurance I’d have greatly appreciated when I was a kid freaking out over what in hindsight was always inconsequential, and that half the royalties go to a children’s charity is just icing on the cake.\n\nSadly Slow Down, Bull’s narrative is saying one thing, while it’s gameplay is saying another. While it’s design is simple enough for anyone to understand in a minute, utilizing only two buttons and focusing around a straightforward collecting mechanic, its scoring system is far less lenient. I was constantly being punished for small mistakes, having to make extremely precise runs just to pass levels and even then being told it wasn’t good enough and I needed to try again.\n\nSo much of Slow Down, Bull feels designed so as to be a game everyone can enjoy, with an encouraging message and easygoing gameplay loop, but despite how many times it told me it’s OK that I’m not perfect its scoring system defiantly stated the opposite. It told me that I had to be exact, to get the best scores, to be absolutely perfect if I even wanted to see the next level, and this in turned made playing Slow Down, Bull incredibly stressful. Suddenly I understood why Esteban was getting so worked up, as his game is almost hostile in how hard it pushes you before you’re allowed to proceed.\n\nI really do love a lot of what Slow Down, Bull is trying to do. I like that Insomniac Games is branching out into new platforms and gameplay styles, that they tried to make something encouraging and entertaining regardless of your age, and they’re giving part of the proceeds to help kids that need it. But I feel like by making the game so needlessly challenging and frustrating, they’ve diluted its purpose and made something that instead of helping relieve stress, only served as yet another source of it.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueOtDrKb9hI&ab_channel=MrNinjaSquirrel\nFull disclosure: Slow Down, Bull was reviewed using a copy provided by the developer.

Stressing out when things are not perfect generally results in tearing his artwork to pieces so the more decorations you can the find, the better.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfNa8iks2TM\nSlow Down Bull surprised me a lot, while it may seemed aimed at the younger generation by appearance the gameplay itself is both decent and addictive. Spread across 5 uniquely themed zones levels start simply by requiring you to collect art and make it to the end. Gradually they introduce a range of new game mechanics including possums that cling on and double your score but giving mirrored-like control penalties and a Bull-catcher that chases you but can be trapped in ponds. Eventually not even being given enough art per level you are then required to make use of multiplier stacking and general avoidance skills.\n\nControls are simple though I would recommend a gamepad. Later levels introduced more hazards with greater time restrictions and it become somewhat twitch-based trying to perfect runs. With that said, completing levels is all that was required to make further progress so it's certainly enjoyable for all ages without becoming too frustrated.\n\nSlow Down Bull may not be the game people hoped to see from Insomanic Games but the silver lining is they now have the foot in the door. With half the proceeds going to starlight foundation and much of the game being directly influenced by these youngsters in very unfortunate circumstances, I can easily recommend this game as both fun and a worthy investment.

As a longtime Insomniac Games fan, I am very happy to see them finally have a PC game. Also, the charity aspect makes this game 10x better. Okay, now onto the actual gameplay. The game is simple, very simple, but very enjoyable. I just felt comfy playing it. Its a kind of game you play when you want to get in a good mood. In the end, I strongly suggest you buy the game, even if just as a donation.","April 22, 2015","true","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is simple and fun  and the levels can increseinglly become challengeing. It is a fun casual game to play after intense CS:GO or something similier.\n\nI have enjoyed the time that i speant on it and those who buy it are also supporting a good charity as well.\n\nNow as a personal request, can we have Sunset Overdrive and Ratchet and Clank?","May 26","true","1.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheIronicGamer/recommended/333580/","TheIronicGamer","TheIronicGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheIronicGamer/","1545 products in account","This a pretty basic casual game aimed at a younger audience. It is fun for this audience but I wouldn't recommend it for the typical hardcore steam gamer.\n\nThe presence of the game is to control a bull that gets angry if you move to quickly. The bull automatically moves forward. You can turn him left or right by pressing the arrow keys. However if you move to much he gets angry and starts to charge and destroy everything. The goal of the game is to collect decorations such as buttons or googly eyes and put them in a bucket. You need to try and get as many of these as possible.\n\nI began playing this game myself however it was clear the game wasn't aimed at an audience of my age. I instead decided to get my younger brother who is 8 years old to play it and get his impressions on it. He seemed to be enjoying it and it did present a reasonable challenge to him.\n\nThe story is also a childish story. It would be appealing as well to a younger audience. The simplistic child like graphics style also appeals to this younger audience.\n\nOverall I feel the game was far to basic and child like for me to enjoy. However I would definitely recommend it for a younger child to play. Some of the profits also go to charity as well so that's something to consider when buying it. The game is also very cheap for what it is.\n\nTheIronicGamers rating system Don't ever buy this game.\nMaybe consider it on a sale.\nAn average game.\nA good game that should definitely be considered.\nA must play!\nDisclaimer: I was given a free review key by the developer of the game.","April 30, 2015","true","1.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

Great (and very cute) art style and OST.  Very enjoyable gameplay with simple, intuitive controls.  The levels do become quite challenging, especially if you want to 100% the game.  Even on the tougher levels though, I don't feel too frustrated since I usually just start laughing after I screw up.  I also genuinely appreciate the light-hearted message of Slow Down, Bull.  Also, half of the net proceeds go towards Starlight Children's Foundation.\n\nSlow Down, Bull really does carry Insomniac Games' high level of execution, polish and passion for making great games.","April 27, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a fast, challenging (sometimes frighteningly so!) game. However, the way it uses Esteban's story in conjunction with the game design to inspire empathy is nothing short of fantastic.
