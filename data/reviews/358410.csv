"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/358410/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Rise of the Triad: Dark War is a classic FPS that was released in 1995. It's a Wolf3D-like engine game. A very heavily modified one though. Choose one of the fie characters and kill everything while running real fast.\n\nNow, how was Steam version handled? Pretty nice. It runs on a good DosBox software, all configured properly and with working Steam overlay. You can configure game to use standard WASD and mouse too.\nWhen you launch the game, you will get to choose one of the three games. Dark War is what you should choose, as this is the full version of a game.\nHunt Begins is a shareware version of a game. A Deluxe Shareware version, which came with few additional levels. Yes, somebody made Deluxe Shareware back then. It has exclusive levels, so it's worth playing. The only shame is that it has Full Version's ending instead of shareware one. Try not to spoil yourself there.\nExtreme ROTT is extremely extreme expansion pack for ROTT, which is extremely crazy, insane, sick maniac. It adds no new elements like music or gameplay, instead it's more like a hack that replaces levels with it's own. Yea, ending is same, bosses are same. It's just that levels are so cheap and unfair, it's unbelivably. Watch review on YouTube, I hope it will make you not to want to even touch this one.\n\nOriginal game also supported multiplayer. And quite gloriuosly, with lots of players and many many game modes. But I doubt that you can make it run easily nowdays, probably due to using outdated technology. Or whatever. I didn't even try much, just know that it sure will not be so easy or straightforward. Maybe it doesn't even work. Get this game for single-player anyway.\n\nAnd well, it's quite awesome. To be honest, my first impression was negative one. I picked Lorelei Ni character, who is fast but is very fragile compared to other character, and picked the third skill out of four, which is actually "hard", and then I was quickly mashed up by bullets. You see, game's majority of enemies use unadvoidable hitscan attacks. Bullets, you know. That's something what should never be dangerous too much, or else it will become more cover-based. I didn't like it back then.\nMorale of story: Don't pick Lorelei. And stay on Normal difficulty.\nSo, yes, you can pick any one of the five characters. Their main differences are stats that are: Speed, Accuracy and Health. Speed isn't much of use there due to often use of hitscan. Everybody aside from Lorelei has high Accuracy, she just has Very High. Ultimately, health it what matters there. Consult with manual to see stats for yourself. Also, should be noted that there is one character who is superior to another with no downsides. So yea, it's not all too clever. The other differences are occasional voice and camera height.\n\nThe way how game looks will immmeditly catch your attention. Not only because those digitized nazi-like enemies look awesome and have character to them. And grayish enviroments, with gothic style can be seen slightly in them. But you will notice just how far they were pushing modified Wolfenstein 3D engine. Moving walls, tall rooms, using platforms objects to give verticality to the gameplay. It's quite a joy.\nAlso helps that it has awesome Midi music to it. One of the best. You will find memoriable tune for sure. There is even piano music that sounds castlevania-worthy. Seriously.\n\nAs for gameplay, you run around mazes and shoot things down. And avoiding traps. Developers weren't afraid to be ridiculous crazy and went ahead, putting every thing they belived were cool. There are even things that make you bounce off the floor high into air. And power-ups that I shall not spoil.\n\nWeapon selection is interesting. And silly. You start with single pistol, then can get second pistol and machine gun. Yes, those are direct updates. With infinite ammo.  And then you have rocket launchers of different types, some more devastating than others. So, yes, it will be ludicrous gibs fun time for you there. Rocket Launchers aren't the only weapons, but I told you nothing, okay?\nThe silly thing is how it handles player's weapon equipment. For some reason, you can keep pistols and machine gun, they don't replace each other, even though they are direct upgrades to each other. On other hand, you can only hold one rocket launcher. You would think that it should be another way around. Or just let machine gun replace pistols. But oh well.\n\nMaps are huge and mazey. Will make you go around, flipping switch and finding keys. And finding hidden floorplates, that are hard to see and sometimes mandatory. Not exactly nice thing. Actually, it becomes negative, as on Episode 2 there is one huge outdoor level, that has impressive huge size. And it would be awesome, if it didn't made you run around, finding switches in every corner and inspecting map verrry carefully in search for touchplates. Seriously, I found secret exit there first.\n\nShooting should be good. After all, you got good basic weapon with infinite ammo and rocket launcher to blow things up. And it's true, blowing people up is fun. They also easily get locked in hitstate when shot by machine gun, so one on one encounter is never a problem, it's always crowds. Episode 1 has only cannon fodder, that yell cliche things at you. Episode 2 introduces a really tough enemy that has enough health to requrie few hits from rocket launcher. It makes better use of rocket launchers for once, but shooting him down when out of rockets gets tedious. Episode 3 introduces robots that can be killed with just rocket. But they are quite passive patrollers, so it's still good variety.\nBut Episode 4, the last one, is where game goes down. It exclusively uses tough monks enemies. And they are tough. Way too tough. They are also boring and tedious. Just shooting them down with machine gun will take what feels like a minute. And there is only two of them, melee and slow one and the one which shoots fireballs. Still can be locked in painstate by machine gun. Yea. All tedious.\n\nBut hey, game also has bosses. More or less good ones. That walk around and shoot things at you and use other gimmicks. So yes, more or less proper ones. Third episode boss is known to be the hardest thign in the game. All while Episode 4 boss is most stupid one. The first part of 4th boss is bad, it just has you waiting for him run out of energy for what feels like 10 minutes. The latter part is stupid in good way though.\n\nSo, ROTT is a mix between good and bad. Amazing ideas, trying to push Wolfenstein-era engine to the maximum, but has occasional stupid or tedious things. And it's still one of those things where you get rained by hitscan, not avoiding projectiles as much. Navigating around traps though. Try it. It's probably more positive than negative. Yes, it is.","June 15, 2015","true","10.0"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","21","24","0","0"

The only way to make the game playable I hear is to mod the game code, which I have no clue how to do, theres no step by step guide for people like me, just computer nerd talk.

Mainly buying it for nostalgia and for the dog mode.\nI have to say, playing the game as an invincible dog is surprisingly addicting! It's great fun running around biting your enemies to death and howling in victory.\n\nDog mode can be entered in cheat mode by typing "dipstick" and "woof" while playing the game, but also, bones will appear that will also activate it. The game doesn't spoil you, either, the mode eventually wears off and you can either look for another bone or type "woof" again.\n\nAll in all, I would recommend buying this if you enjoy trips to the old days of gaming, even though this is a revised version of the original ROTT, it still has that old timey feel to it!","March 16","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
