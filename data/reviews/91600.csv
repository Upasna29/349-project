"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MinoruLeonardo/recommended/91600/","MinoruLeonardo","Minoru Leonardo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MinoruLeonardo/","330 products in account","Personal rating: 8/10\nDLC: Worth it. New, more challenging maps. A nice addition to a short core game.\n\nWhat is Sanctum?Sanctum is a completely different take on the "Tower Defense" genre, it mixes up First Person Shooter elements in it and it does it well.\n\nAbout the gameplay:Here's the catch: If you have your mind set on "I'll only upgrade Towers!" or "I'll just shoot everything!", you're in for an embarrassing defeat. You cannot take everything head on here, you need to balance resources to deal with everything coming towards you: enemies that comes in large quantities, tough ones and tricky ones.\n\nDo you want to do the heavy lifting and shoot most of what's coming or use your towers while you kill whatever is left by the end? Or maybe you want to do both of these things? No problem, all three options are possible in this game.\n\nOne of Sanctum's most known aspects is the maze building, you've got room and resources to create your personal enemy slaughtering course, it's far from putting one block here and another over there. If you want to survive the toughest levels of Sanctum you'll need to smart up and create mazes that will force enemies to walk as much as they can.\n\nSomething that should be noted:Unlike Sanctum 2, there is absolutely no grinding in Sanctum 1. You start with everything the game gives you and after a short, optional, Tutorial you're free to do whatever you feel like in the first map. Play and learn, no hand holding here aside from the absolutely necessary.\n\nTower Defense, because calling it "Resource Management" sounds like a boring disciplineBalancing resources here can be tough, they are rather scarce early on and woe betide the unprepared. Do you upgrade your towers or your guns? A difficult choice that can be the difference between victory or defeat.\n\nTowers and Weapons can be upgraded up to Level 6, and while they seem extremely cheap at first don't go thinking you can leave a bunch of Level 1 towers scattered and expect them to do heavy damage; enemies gets progressively stronger and soon you'll realize even your Level 3 towers are hardly doing any significant damage. And the same will apply to your guns if you ignore them.\n\nUpgrades will considerably power up your towers and guns, however they'll also become incredibly expensive and on shorter Campaign maps (with 20 or less waves), chances are, you won't be having lots of Level 6 towers even by the end of the map unless you focus more on them.\n\nSanctum: Not an easy gameIf you are looking for a difficult game, Sanctum may be your cup of tea. The game is ruthless, but hardly unfair. It punishes poor planning and poor shooting accuracy and you'll probably be frustrated once you see that your carefully planned maze and towers did not work, but amazed when you beat that tough wave with your wits.\n\nThe greatest challenge at the start is to understand how to balance your resources between weapons and towers, and until you find your own balance point, you'll be hitting that "Load Checkpoint" button quite often.\n\nThe game is merciless and will not shy away from dropping tough enemies, although not without warning: the game provides a list for a number of incoming waves and what will be there.\n\nHowever Sanctum fail in one crucial point: there is no indication on how resilient the enemies will be. In one wave you may face a single, but extremely resistant, enemy and at the other wave the same type of enemy in larger numbers, however with much less HP. This can and will catch you off guard and is one of the very few times the game will play "dirty".\n\nFor those wishing an even greater challenge there is the Insane difficulty with VERY resistant enemies and a core as fragile as cracked glass.\n\nSanctum, where the simplest level can take 1 hour to complete.Every level can be VERY long. Even the first one can take anywhere between 30 minutes (if you are insanely fast) to 1 hours and a half and can last even longer. But don't worry: the Campaign has checkpoints between waves which you can also use to correct a mistake as long your have enough resources. It may sound cheap, but picking the "Load Checkpoint" will be something you'll do often here unless you feel there is no hope and click on the "Restart Level".\n\nThe multiplayer option ramps this up by letting you set the game to 30 waves on any map, which easily means games going past 1 hour.\n\nMultiplayer Mayhem (Single if you must)The multiplayer in Sanctum is a bit different. Instead of a normal game with fixed waves every game on every map will have random enemies waves coming for you and your friends, that's right, no game will be quite the same and sometimes you'll be forced to change your tactics since the game can be downright mean sending airborne enemies and another wave of tricky enemies right away.\n\nYou can also change how long the game will last: from 10 to 20 or even 30 waves, or an endless Survival mode, with increasingly stronger enemies, but with MUCH more resources than the normal, single player only, Campaign. This means more towers, faster weapon upgrades and more towers.\n\nDon't have friends that play Sanctum? Friends can't play right now? No problem. You can Host a game like this and play by yourself if you wish to, or leave open to friends (or other people) so they can join during it.\n\nYou can also opt to play with people from the world but be warned: the Sanctum multiplayer is fairly dead and even on weekends it may be hard to get a lasting game with someone.\n\nMultiplayer has a few problems, though. Once you finish a map you are forced to create a new game and invite your friends again which doesn't sound bad, but gets annoying if you play with 2 or more people. It may be also a pet peeve mine, but you don't get levels achievements even if you do complete them with 30 waves setting, however you do keep progress from others like "Kill 4000 Runners"\n\nMusic for your earsSanctum also has an amazing soundtrack, much more relaxing and soothing than what you'd expect for a game about killing hordes of enemies while hearing the heroine laughing and screaming in glee.\n\nFor some the music will feel strangely out of place and annoying, for others it will be a contribution to immerse the player.\n\nFinal notesThe game came out in 2011, and even on 2014 it remains one of the most pleasant, satisfactory games to play.\n\nUnfortunately Sanctum is often underrated and overlooked by people, sometimes because of its graphics and sometimes because it is a game that takes time to learn and it won't be afraid to slap you in the face quite often while you learn it.\n\nSanctum is a game created with care and you can notice it as you play. Coffee Stain Studios did a good job with this game and it is worth your money and time. Even if you are not a fan of Tower Defense or First Person Shooter genres, give Sanctum a try at least in the demo, you may be surprised.","October 29, 2014","true","84.9"," 121 of 123 people (98%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","98","121","123","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Luriam/recommended/91600/","Luriam","Luriam","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Luriam/","307 products in account","If you are reading this review right now, and consider buying the game, do it. It's that simple, the game is totally worth the money. First of all, it's a First Person Shooter Tower Defense game. It's rules are simple:\n\n- Choose your personal Towers and Weapons.\n- Build blocks to create a maze as big as possible.\n- Build towers using resources that you gain for completing waves.\n- Upgrade your gear and towers.\n- Defend the core at all cost.\n\nSanctum has this good feeling of progression. Each new wave provides another, a more difficult challenge. And the player must keep up. By upgrading the towers and weapons. Which by the way, come in a surprisingly pleasant number. There are a lot of different towers to choose from. Some are used to deal damage to the creatures on the ground, and some to those airborn. So it's a good idea to buy them both, and experiment with their placement. Another very nice addition, are the "Support Towers". They can manipulate your enemies in various ways. The "Slow Field" for example, slows every creature that steps on the ground where it's placed. There also towers that amplify both yours and your tower's attacks, make your enemies more susceptible to damage, and so on. Speaking of enemies, each type of creature has it's own good looking alien body. That comes with a certain, sometimes hidden, area called the "Weakspot". Each alien has it's own unique abilities, like "Charging", "Soaking", "Dodging", well, you get the point. They not only behave differently, but also look so. Very cool and fantastic-looking models.\n\nYour towers are the main source of firepower in Sanctum. But the player is as important. You get to choose from 6 unique weapons like the "Sniper", "Freeze",and "Tesla" guns. Which come in very handy when dealing with certain enemies. Especially those that somehow survived your defenses. You can create some really awesome guns and towers combinations if you think about it. You could, for example, use your "Freeze" gun to temporarily stun all the enemies in a certain radius. And then blow them all away with a charged "REX". It's really awesome come to think about it.\n\nAnother thing worth mentioning is the variety of maps (16 if have the DLCs) and game mods (like Bounty, Stamina, Pre-Build, and Standart). Which add a certain feeling of freedom. And the maps are pretty awesome. They look vibrant and alive, full of fauna and flora. Which is so strange looking that it makes you love it. Giant spores, glowing trees, multiple Suns, huge flowers, and mineral-rich caves. But the best thing about the maps, are the Easter Eggs. There are so many secret spots to find. So well-hidden and camouflaged, that you'll spend some time looking for them, and when you'll finally find them, they'll put a smile on that face.\n\nAnd now, my favorite subject, the Music. I never thought I'd enjoy Sanctum's music so much as I do. Every map has 2 pieces of music attached to it. The first one plays in the "Building" phase. Usually a rather slow and tuneful loop, which I always like. And the second piece plays while the "Action" phase is in progress. A very pulsing, rhythmic and dynamic song, that I just love. Just listen to THIS or THIS. Please do, they might seem simple and plain, but they feel so complex and sparkling. 16 different maps, 2 songs for each... You do the math. All the credit goes to Coffee Stain Studios, and more specificaly to the genius Gustaf Tivander.\n\nThe last but not least, the best feature of this game is the Cooperative play. You and up to three of your friends get to build, upgrade and defend together. It's fun and effective, it grants even more creativity and firepower. Letting you get the most of this game. Which I strongly recommend if you're looking for either a good Co-op, or Tower Defense.\n\n\n\n10/10","April 9, 2014","true","171.8"," 61 of 67 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","61","67","0","0"

If you like tower defense at all and don't mind FPS, give it a shot. A great blend of strategy + action.\n\nLong version: Sanctum is great for TD fans that either like or don't mind some FPS action in their games. The two aspects blend together very well; on lower difficulties, one can pretty easily focus on one over the other and do fine, while on higher difficulties both are needed pretty equally. Additionally, there are towers that help your shots and a gun that helps your towers, ensuring that the two aren't just separate parts of the same game but actually integrated together.\n\nEven aside from FPS tactics, there's a fair amount more strategy than in most TD games, as the player must build a map for the enemies to travel on and building good maps can be necessary for survival. Building a map that makes enemies take longer to travel necessarily means less space for defensive towers, balancing the game with a choice of longer path or more firepower. And of course, correct positioning of towers for the most effective use of each one is as important as always in a TD game. Even the size of certain towers can be a strategic point for ensuring the player can move around flexibly.\n\nOne can bring 3 different guns and up to 6 different towers to maps, ensuring many different ways to play the game, although the total number of guns and towers may be a bit low to take full advantage of that.\n\nIf there's one problem I have with the game it's that some of the map designs come off as very lazy, but you'll largely forget about that when constructing a maze. I haven't played much multiplayer or survival mode myself, but in later waves of longer games, guns can also come to be seemingly ineffectual, as damage doesn't scale at all with the growing power of enemies. Sanctum does what it does near perfectly and there are very few changes I would consider making to improve it.","November 18, 2013","true","81.4"," 45 of 48 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","45","48","0","0"

Try the insane dificulty :O\n\n- Sometimes it gets boring when maps take +45minutes to beat all waves or you have a nice Turret and maze combination built to do most of your work.\n- Multiplayer has almost no players. (Never seen more than 7 players online).\n- There is a buggy achievement. (Takes forever to get it, even though it's one of the easiest)\n- You will probably need some guides to find all the secrets because they are extremely hard to find on your own.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lunaril/recommended/91600/","Lunaril","Lunaril","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lunaril/","880 products in account","Sanctum is a Tower Defense game which allows for a first person shooter perspective. Released in 2011, graphically it doesn't look bad at all. The object of the game is to lay blocks and outfit them with varying weaponry to direct the path of your enemy waves, lay down suppressive fire and take out as many enemies as possible, and have a varied amount of weapons as each wave has different enemies who have resistences to certain types of damage. Once you have done this, you go into initiate a wave, use your own personal first person shooter weapons and assist the towers with defeating waves before they reach your core. At the end of each wave you are given a number of resources which can be spent on upgrades both to the towers as well as your personal weapons.\n\nI've played several tower defense games, but this one let's you get down in there and add a personal touch to defense, by combining the FPS experience with more traditional tower defense features. While I enjoyed Sanctum, I look forward to seeing what happens next in the series and how they upgrade our experience to another level. Sanctum features single player mode, a variety of different levels each with their own geography and challenges, as well as multiplayer mode. I recommend going through the tutorial phase, so you really get an understanding of what the weapons and enemies are capable of before diving right into the main game.","October 2, 2015","true","0.8"," 31 of 36 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","31","36","0","1"

It's really just about a girl who defends a major core built from her allies from aliens invading. It's basic, but what I gotta give an above average score is it's presentation. First, the aliens. They look so cool! They're all very distinctive and unique in their own design and traits, and works perfectly with the game's tone. The soundtrack of the game's Really lovely and engaging as well. I loved and was happy buying it's soundtrack after trying out the game.\n\nGameplay: 10\nThis is the highlight of the game and what makes it SO good~! The game is one of the world's first First Person Shooter Tower of Defence. The design behind it and the strategy one has to make is perfect. The majority of the weapons are awesome, and it all plays good roles to strategize on how to defeat the aliens from reaching the core. Keep in mind that the game's Very hard, and takes a lot of practice to get it going, but still worth it. I feel like the combat was very balanced. With the constant reloads your own weapon has, it gives good opportunity for your towers to fight and cover for you.\n\nOverall: 9\nIt's very obvious this game can't be for everyone, but it's still incredibly addicting. I am extremely happy I gave this game a try. It's super memorable, it's tons of fun, very challenging, and provides great replay value. It's a shame it's not that well played much since the release of it's sequel title, for I'd love to try out the Co-Op version of this at some point, but doesn't stop me from trying the game again in single player and play it more often.

Definitely give this one a spin unless you heavily dislike FSPs.\n\nLong Version:\nGameplay - The hybrid tower/FPS feels very good as you can single handedly wipe the some mobs yourself, let the towers do it for yourself or fine tune your defence in order to covers each's sides flaws or create true deathzones. There's a very decent number of maps with varied layouts and the possibilty to maze in your own style. Your typical towers/weapons are here with a few more original concepts in between. The difficulty feels fair, it takes good tower strategy and shooting in order to clear the more difficult maps. Multiplayer is there too and I had great fun playing with some friends, too bad they can't help you tackle the Insane difficulty ones so I could get those achievements T_T.\n\nStory - Not much of it at first glance, there's material outside the game and some secrets to be found in some maps but overall it's not the selling point. It would eventually get greatly expanded in Sanctum 2 but I'll comment on that on it's review.\n\nSound - I surprinsingly love this game's tunes, I often listen to game ST's outside and people give me the looks but, listen to Sanctum's, and they praise it, they can't believe it's from a game, it's a different style. (Which I would love more of, if anyone know' more stuff like this PM me or something, I couldn't find more work by the same guy).\n\nGraphics - The looks fit the futuristic style and everything is clean and slick. I personally tone some of it down because all the bloom and stuff makes the game so bright and vividly coloured it hurts my eyes but that's my preference.","May 9","true","143.4"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","0"

It requires you to balance resources and defense structures. The goal of each map is to defend a core from incoming waves of monsters. Simple right? It's not. Each wave is unique in that the content varies. Some waves may only contain one monster, while another wave can contain many types. Each monster has a specific weak spot that you target to kill them more effectively. You have to destoy these waves by constructing an efficient maze of towers and guns. But you don't have unlimited resources; only what is given to you after each wave. That's when creativity and balancing come into play.\n\nThe game is even more fun under mulitplayer mode. With more people, you have more resources to spend to defend your core. However, the monster waves are random and stronger than the single player version. Communication is key to having a sucessful game. A method that can be used have each person focus on a type of tower (one person can focus on anti-air and floors, while another one could focus on ground and laser towers)\n\nThis game was worth the purchase. It provides you with a great challenge. Be warned though because each round can take up to an hour or more. If you have plenty of time to kill and want a challenge, then this game is for you. But if you don't have the time or patience to play, skip this game. There will be times where after playing for 45 minutest to an hour, you find out that your core has been attacked and you no longer have that 100%. You quit and then you resume from last save. So have paitence when playing this game.\n\nOne last note: Play around with the multiplayer chat. You'll be laughing a lot.","January 15, 2015","true","207.1"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","91","10","11","7","1"

FPS play works very well in the game to keep the action going.\nIt's also very cool to play with other people, I've gone hours on survival mode with my friends.\n\nThe game has a lot of content going for it already, but then there's also the free DLCs and the really cheap ones (they go down to $0.99 on sale).\n\nI find the game is better than Sanctum 2 - the game just feels better. It really has polish, and I felt Sanctum 2 kind of lacked that; as a result, it's a funner game. You don't have to level up for perks, (the grind is removed entirely) and there isn't pressure to be constantly firing at all times.\n\nI also see much better FPS in this game than in Sanctum 2, even when I turn down the graphics to low. The game ends up looking worse than Sanctum 1 but still doesn't run as well.\n\nThere are a lot of really cool towers in this game too, and the lack of a wall limit (which was an odd decision for Sanctum 2 that further distanced it from a TD game) lets you be much more inventive with the game.\n\nPast that, Sanctum is really a good game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DT_76/recommended/91600/","DT_76","DT76","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DT_76/","62 products in account","I enjoyed this one quite a bit.  Many if not most games I've played that try to mix tower defense with a controllable character fall flat because the balance doesn't work.  In this one, though, you can't only focus on one aspect.  If you just level up your weapons a ton, you'll run up against cooldowns and ammo restrictions and never be able to gun down all the enemies yourself.  If you only build towers and try to take a smoke break during the level, you'll be overrun during waves that have skill-dependent enemies.\nThe inclusion of enemies with a weak point that the player can aim for, but the towers won't, is an inspired choice.  It forces you to build and act in concert with your defenses.  Tough enemies can be slowed down, things that are only vulnerable in a single spot can be sniped, and swarms can be intelligently targeted with AOE attacks.  The sole drawback is that you can only hold 3 guns, and the sniper rifle and cold gun seem, to me, indispensable.\n\nThe other complaint I can make is that the 3-D nature of the game isn't fully supported/exploited.  So, unlike most TD games, a tower can't just shoot anything in its 'range'.  It has to have line-of-sight (in most cases).  This is good, as it forces you to think about where to put your blocks, which ones to make shot-transparent, and what obstacles in the level will affect your fields of fire. It's bad, though, because the game will show you a circle on the overhead view that denotes the tower's max range, but nothing else.  If you want to learn what it can actually see, the only solutions are to put your character's perspective as close as you can to the tower's (usually impossible, since you can't stand inside it, and the towers are mostly a lot taller than your PC) or observe what it shoots at during the levels (which requires you to look carefully at the overview while the action's going on, and not participate in the defense).  A feature that gave you the POV of the tower would make this so much easier.\nOf note, this recommendation includes the free add-ons unlocking new towers and weapons, as well as the paid-for DLC granting new maps.  This adds much-needed variety, and I would probably be less enthusiastic if I'd played it at release.","July 7, 2014","true","77.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

In Sanctum, you roam the map, FPS-style, adding your own firepower against the invaders. You can choose to upgrade your personal firepower in the same way you upgrade your towers. The most useful mindset is to think of yourself as a mobile tower that augments your fixed towers. Along with the usual kill pits you build in TD games, you'll find yourself creating several kill corridors -- straight walkways that you can pearch at the end of and get maximum use out of your personal weaponry.\n\nAt release there are are only 3 maps, but more are promised. 4-6 hours of entertainment, playing once through. More maps will help this game.\n\nYou can play mutliplayer, too.\n\nI give Sanctum a recommendation to fans of TD. Others should probably start with a more traditional TD game like Defense Grid, which offers more maps, more polish, and a better all-around value. Still, Sanctum is worth a look.

I paid .99 USD for it so for that price you cant really go too wrong. I enjoyed the game at first, its uniqu(ish) blend of FPS and TD was amusing, but I soon started to see that the game was lacking in some areas. I played with a friend as well to see what how he felt about and found us agreeing in most areas. My biggest griped was polish. The game seems like it coulda used a decent amount it. I noticed animations gliching out a bunch of times, turrets having fits when enemies quickly moved in and out of range, the player often getting stuck and needing to teleport out (seems like a copout from a dev standpoint).\n\nMy friends biggest gripe was odd balancing. We often found that the first 4-6 waves of enemies we could stop before they barely made any progress out of the starting point, then the next wave would break right through to the end and we'd loose. Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, insanely hard. Not a fun difficutly curve.\n\nAlso, while the fps portions of the game all worked nicely and looked good, the TD portions seemed ad hoc assembly of tower defense features that didnt fit together to well anf felt clunky. Like the game was designed as a FPS defense kinda thing, then someone added in the the tower stuff where ever it would fit. That being said if you love FPSs and are so so about TDs, then this might just be for you! But if you love TDs and could take or leave a FPS, then this isnt going to mesh well.\n\nIts not a bad game, and Im sure there are lots of people who love it. But, it wanst my cup of tea. To me it felt like 2/10 TD and 8/10 FPS, where a smash hit in my eyes would have those numbers transposed. Over all i would give it a 6 out of 10.

There are 5 or 6 main levels, each consisting of a whole bunch of "waves". In between each wave, you use resources to build various types of turrets/defenses and/or upgrade your weapons. Once a wave starts, between you and your defenses, you just have to lay the smackdown on a bunch of advancing aliens. Rinse and repeat. Overall, it's a pretty fun game. However, the between-wave building parts kind of brought the game down for me due to the need to build all your defenses in first person. It's very tedious and time-consuming (and also confusing at times, especially on larger maps). The game would be so much better if the building could be done via a top down "god view". But other than that, no major complaints. Apparently it is more fun in multiplayer, but I never ended up checking that out.

With an all-female cast this ought to please those without girlfriends, or girls who think that games need more girls. Anyway, there are plenty of easter eggs hidden around the place, sure you may think that the game is just about placing towers and shooting aliens, but hidden in the easter eggs is a very rich story, as is brought forward in Sanctum 2. I would personally have loved this as an open-world game. Amazing game for people who like Tower Defence or First Person Shooters, or maybe a bit of both!","October 4, 2014","true","11.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

A great mix between Tower Defense (Strategy) and FPS (Action). A highly addictive game where the main drive - at least for me - is to reach a perfect balance between placement of the right towers and upgrading your weapons at the right time to reach maximum efficiency and ultimately perfection (100% Core), of course on insane difficulty setting.\nFurthermore Sanctum features an even more addictive multiplayer, prooving the fact that bulding and shooting with other players is even more fun!!\nA great game indeed, way better than I could have ever imagined :)","November 9, 2011","true","141.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

However your weapons are purely complementary meaning you can't just tank the entire level by yourself. While they are still useful, they are somewhat of a novelty item. That isn't necessarily a bad thing though.\nLike most tower defenses, there is some 2 lined story somewhere but nothing to get excited about.\nI don't play many TD games but I find this one charming and quite likable.\n\nThe gameplay is simplistic and easy, standard TD rules apply. Build and maze, install turrets, upgrade turrets, don't let them get all the way. Of course you can assist them greatly with your own weapons, complementary but ultimately effective.\nThe enemies are the norm with few variations; fast but no armour, slow but heavily protected etc. There is one unit whose shield will only go down from a headshot and one who is so tough they require constant attention from your assault rifle.\n\nGraphics are cartoonish and light. The sountrack is half decent. My relatively high end laptop handles this game without any problems. Recommended for pretty much anyone who has a modicum of interest in TD games.","January 3","true","2.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

After some time playing I have to say it's a really great game. Combining TD and FPS is what makes this game so enjoyable. In the setup phase you have time to build walls and towers, as well as upgrade them (and your own weapons). Once you hit enter, the wave starts and you don't have to watch your towers doing the work - you jump into the action yourself. The towers might be powerful but there's certain things they can't do which you can. Aiming for enemies weakness spots for instance.

Blast through waves of alians in a variety of locations.  Each map offers multiple strategies and with the selection of towers, each match can be a completely new experience.  While tower placement and maze design are significant, the player and their weapons stand to make a difference with proper timing and resource management.  The towers and weapons can be used in conjunction for devastating attacks.\n\nThe user interface and combat style are well designed and easy to understand.  The graphics are outstanding.  The world design and weapon models are unique, yet recognizable.  Each tower and weapon has noticeable visual upgrades as they progress in level.\n\nThis game is enjoyable in one-player mode.  In my opinion the pinnacle of what this game has to offer can be found in the online multiplayer.  2-4 players build and work together to protect their core.  There exists a collective sense of teamwork, but also a spirit of competition to see who can kill the most aliens.\n\nAltogether, this game offers both an in-depth Tower Defense motif structured around a solid First Person shooter, the combination of which is unparalleled on the available gaming market.\n\nTL;DR 10/10 would play again","May 26, 2012","true","433.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The weapon DLC is not pay-to-win (thankfully) but instead just gives you more flexibility for playstyle.  It's a tower-defense game, you can place blocks to adjust enemy movement, put towers on them, said towers can be upgraded.\n\nFairly simple style, and very fun.  I played for 100 minutes my first playthrough, and that was only 2 levels!  There's no character customization (unfortunately) so you're stuck as the red-head you see in the banner.  You unlock more towers as you play through (maybe more weapons, I hadn't found more yet) which gives you more variety, and the enemies are VERY varied and specialist.  One will run incredibly fast if given a straight sprint, but slows to a crawl around corners.  Another can only be damaged by shooting it in the back of the head.\n\n7/10 And thanks to my friend Erythrocytes for gifting me this.","November 4, 2011","true","10.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It requires you to balance resources and defense structures. The goal of each map is to defend a core from incoming waves of monsters. Simple right? It's not. Each wave is unique in that the content varies. Some waves may only contain one monster, while another wave can contain many types. Each monster has a specific weak spot that you target to kill them more effectively.  You have to destoy these waves by constructing an efficient maze of towers and guns. But you don't have unlimited resources; only what is given to you after each wave. That's when creativity and balancing come into play.\n\nThe game is even more fun under mulitplayer mode. With more people, you have more resources to spend to defend your core. However, the monster waves are random and stronger than the single player  version. Communication is key to having a sucessful game. A method that can be used have each person focus on a type of tower (one person can focus on anti-air and floors, while another one could focus on ground and laser towers)\n\nThis game was worth the purchase. It provides you with a great challenge. Be warned though because each round can take up to an hour or more. If you have plenty of time to kill and want a challenge, then this game is for you. But if you don't have the time or patience to play, skip this game. There will be times where after playing for 45 minutest to an hour, you find out that your core has been attacked and you no longer have that 100%. You quit and then you resume from last save. So have paitence when playing this game.\n\nOne last note: Play around with the multiplayer chat. You'll be laughing a lot.\n","December 30, 2014","true","9.7"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","1"

Aesthetically it feels very similar to Unreal Tournament 3 [It feels like it was influenced by Japanese culture], just using a brighter palette than UT3.\n\nGameplay wise, you plot out where you want the enemies to go by building blocks and creating tunnels to funnel the enemy to the path of the Core, which you're defending. Each block can be upgraded to hold a gatling gun, scattering laser [Attacks ground + air enemies], lightning bolt [which takes a bit to charge but will do massive damage], and a dozen other weapons + DLC weapons. Each individual unit is upgradeable [including the guns you bring on your character] and deciding on what to upgrade between waves is important, as each wave throws a different setup of enemies at you, which it will tell you on the bottom left before starting.\n\nWhether at full price or on sale, this game is a steal.","May 5, 2012","true","21.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mastercamel/recommended/91600/","mastercamel","Camel Master","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mastercamel/","1506 products in account","Sanctum offers a refreshing idea of combining tower defence and first-person shooter. Before each wave the player (or players) builds defence consisting of blocks, towers and other hindrances to enemies. The strategic building phase is very important as in every tower defence game, but also the shooting aid from player is needed. This has the game in great balance between calm and intense phases, and there is never a boring moment to this game. Also no shooting can help if you don't build enough decently your towers.\n\nWhile the graphics and gunplay are very barebones and the sequel is a lot better in many aspects, Sanctum is definitely worth a check. It has maybe a bit more weight on the tower building aspect than the shooting - this makes it a different game than the excellent Sanctum 2 which improves the gunplay mechanics and is more shooter-heavy. Check this and especially Sanctum 2 out.","December 13, 2013","true","7.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It’s a tower defence game, but then becomes an FPS when the round starts, and you go shooting up the baddies along side your turrets. It also has co-op, and is even more fun when playing with your friends. The art also reminds me of borderlands some.

It is a tower defense FPS hybrid that is engaging and fun to play. However, it was developed independently and it shows through the graphics and user interface at times. Some of the on-screen elements are in your face, and some of the tower building is awkward. This is nothing that can't be ironed out in Sanctum 2, (which I have yet to play) so overall a fun game to play.","February 23, 2014","true","17.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you have played dungeon defenders it is somewhat similar although Sanctum is first-person and has no character classes. However, you do get several weapons to choose from before each map and you can generally bring about 3 along with you. Even better, you get to choose about 5-8 types of towers to take along as well and so there is a lot of flexibility in how you want to set up your defenses. Plus if you have a friend who will play then that's more hours of fun right there.","December 31, 2013","true","9.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The tower appearance is more relatable to their function than in the second, the so-called enemy "wiki" is really handy and very easily accessible. It's overall very good.

The weapon DLC is not pay-to-win (thankfully) but instead just gives you more flexibility for playstyle.  It's a tower-defense game, you can place blocks to adjust enemy movement, put towers on them, said towers can be upgraded.\n\nFairly simple style, and very fun.  I played for 100 minutes my first playthrough, and that was only 2 levels!  There's no character customization (unfortunately) so you're stuck as the red-head you see in the banner.  You unlock more towers as you play through (maybe more weapons, I hadn't found more yet) which gives you more variety, and the enemies are VERY varied and specialist.  One will run incredibly fast if given a straight sprint, but slows to a crawl around corners.  Another can only be damaged by shooting it in the back of the head.\n\n7/10 And thanks to my friend Erythrocytes for gifting me this.","November 4, 2011","true","10.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/solaris32/recommended/91600/","solaris32","solaris32","http://steamcommunity.com/id/solaris32/","2004 products in account","This review originally written on June 18, 2012 on GameFAQs\n\n"A unique tower defense and FPS hybrid worthy of your time."\n\nSanctum is a tower defense game at its heart. You build towers and create mazes to stop the waves of enemies. All of this is in done in first person and when the wave starts you can use your 3 guns to personally attack the enemies. As the developers have said this is the first game ever to have this combination and it sure is fun!\n\nGRAPHICS: 10/10\nThe graphics are pretty good all around. It can be taxing on older computers so it should be noted that the developers have thoughtfully allowed you to edit the engine files to reduce the graphics even further. To me this is a huge plus because if I couldn't do that I couldn't play this game. My only complaint is that the lower your resolution the fuzzier the text gets. I can barely read it at 800x600. The higher your resolution the harder the game is on your computer. That said this game lets you go down all the way to 320x200! So if your computer is real bad you can turn the resolution down that far and play with ease when you start the wave, then turn it up in between waves to build.\n\nSOUND: 9/10\nThere are some nice sound effects when you build and do things like that. The gun sounds are kind of lackluster but this isn't heavily focused on that. Nothing bad about the monster sounds either. The music is actually really good and doesn't get repetitive or annoying.\n\nSTORY\nNo score because there isn't a story and tower defense games don't necessarily need one. I think they have released some lore and stuff in preparation for the sequel but I haven't read any of it. All I know is that you're a girl and you have something on your left arm that allows you to build towers. Your goal is to stop the invading monsters from getting to the giant blue core. What that core is I don't know.\n\nTOWER DEFENSE ASPECT: 10/10\nAs I said this game is tower defense at its heart and it does not disappoint. There are several tower types, all useful to varying degrees depending on your play style. Something this game does that sadly few TDs do is allowing you to build a maze that the enemies are forced to run through. This allows for even more strategy than just simply building at certain spots outside of the enemies' route. On most maps you can create their route! You also have a set amount of towers equipped that you can then use to build on the level. This means even more strategy.\n\nFIRST PERSON SHOOTER ASPECT: 9/10\nThis game is a shooter at a distant second. When you manually start the next wave of enemies you can then shoot them with your own weapons which you choose before the level starts. This part of the game is pretty basic as expected. The weapons are simple but each one does have an alternate fire which adds more variety. You can also upgrade them with your money to make them stronger. Despite shooting not being the main focus it's still essential for beating the levels.\n\nWhat gives this a 9/10 instead of something lower is the fact that all enemies have a weak spot that can be exploited by you for a great increase in damage. Further, some enemies can only be killed by hitting them in their weak spot, something that isn't easy for your towers. There is an enemy that can only be hurt from its back. A tall enemy with a bobbing head that only takes damage from attacks to its head. Still another that has armor that greatly reduces damage to it and the only way to temporarily remove the armor is for a single concentrated shot (sniper) to hit it in the head. All this means a lot more strategy and player input is required than just simply shooting the enemy. Unfortunately if you have horrendous aiming skills you may have trouble, but there is an easy difficulty for you to enjoy.\n\nENEMIES: 9/10\nThere are more enemy types than the ones listed above, and they're all distinct. There are also flying enemies which pay no heed to your carefully made mazes. The designs are unique and interesting and follow a similar theme.\n\nLENGTH AND REPLAYABILITY\nThere are several maps to enjoy including a few free ones and others you must pay for (worth it). Each map has 4 difficulties as well as various survival modes to play. On normal a map will take an hour or so to beat. There is also multiplayer but I never messed with that.\n\nFINAL SCORE: 9/10\nThis is a must play for any fan of tower defense, if only to check out something new and unique in the genre. Even if you aren't into TDs check this game out (so long as you at least like FPSs) and who knows it just might get you into the genre. I got this game on a sale and it's worth it even at full price. There is a demo so if you aren't sure give it a spin.","October 26, 2015","true","8.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It sports online co-op, good looking graphics, and lots of DLC to sift through and throw money at the developers for. For the longest time, this game was overpriced.

The online co-op definately has some problems, however the game is brought together by the soundtrack, graphics, and cool dlc towers.  If you are a huge tower defense fan then this game is worth it.

These include first person placement and upgrading of towers and first person shooting.  Unreal based graphics engine looks sharp and polished.  Your weapons can be upgraded in lieu of tower defenses.  Tower foundations can be fitted with teleporters allowing quick access to different parts of the map.  Well thoughtout and executed.

Why? To be honest, I didn't expected much for this kind mix of genres and since I got it from some bundle I didn't really care about previous game. I enjoyed Sanctum 2 so I decided to get first one on next sale. I don't regret it. People complain that there aren't mapy maps - don't forget about difficult levels. I don't think number of maps are important in this kind of games. Many years ago, when Flash Element TD was created, there was only one map but many people enjoyed it for hundreds of hours. Still, there is some variety, so it's not like you don't have any choice at all. Sadly, maybe for me, the number of towers you will be using are very low... maybe I just found out a great tactic so I wasn't in need to use others than 2 or 3. Same goes for weapons - sniper and rocket launcher will alone make you powerful to depend less on towers. Maybe it's because I already had some experience from Sanctum 2, but the difficult level, even the hardest one, was surely more easier than those in second Sanctum game. Still, it can be a really nice challenge for people who enjoys all kind of Tower Defense games. And I recommend even this strange, but very fun, mix. I had really good time playing it and maybe some day I will want to play it once again. Just be sure to have some friends if you want to have fun online, since there aren't many active players.","October 3, 2015","true","100.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Its great for two players and has interesting achievments. The scenario on each map is amazing and wandering around it is even better.

The game is a HUD-interactive tower defense where you choose what to build and upgrade, while fighting a horde of monsters. There are 6(maybe more!) weapons and about 12 different types of tower you can build. It is maybe the only game where single player is actually fun. Of course, there is a multiplayer mode where you can battle and cooperate with your friends while building and upgrading buildings to reach the perfect strategy.

The level designs are breathtaking, the music gives you chills, and it makes for a very enjoyable game experience. However, to refrain from stress-induced rage I highly recommend sticking to the lower difficulties, I found even 'Normal' difficulty to be a painful, frustrating, repetitive slog towards the later waves. So let it never be said this game doesn't challenge you. It tests your gaming ability, your strategic thinking, and your level of sanity, as you may very well end up picking up the monitor and hurling it through a wall by the end of it.","July 31, 2013","true","99.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I think it was fun to pop in and play for a little while, but the old feel of Warcraft 3-era Tower Defense Mods I was looking for was lost since I only got the chance to play by myself. I found myself mainly booting it up for a few waves while waiting for friends to sign online to play other games. Would be great as a tablet game to play on train/plane rides, but I don't think I'd sit down and dedicate long stretches of time to just Sanctum.\n\nI think if you're looking at it from a fresh perspective, go ahead and give it a whirl.

A tower defense game, played from a first persion view. You got some weapons, but even if priorizing to upgrade those, it's more like you're assissting the towers in doing their job (f.e. by freezing enemies in tower range, dropping the shields of tanks with precision sniping or killing enemies that can only be attacked from behind).\nIn it's core, it's still just a TD. And, if I may so, a pretty shallow one at that. I've seen and played FLASH tower defense games, YEARS ago, which had mroe varied content, enemies, tactics.\nLet's add the mediocre graphic onto this and the... well, there is a store, but it's barely communicated. Which is a pity, because the atmosphere was supposed to be a good part about the game.\n\nOverall, this title really didn't amaze or catch me.\nResult: 4/10","December 12, 2013","false","1.1"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

I played this with one of my friends and we had the best maze possbile with leveled up towers. But guest what! They send either 500 speedy units that you can only kill a few or they said a about 5 giant units with around 10,000,000 hp. I thinking I got this since I upgraded my sniper rifle and the damage ampfing square to the max level doing around 1 million damage per shot. But guest what! There big monsters just laugh at the damage and just go on slowly to your base. There is no stratgeay  when all you do is sit there following the monsters shooting at them. I feel like all the towers don't do anything but add a little damage here and there even though they are full upgraded. The anti air towers are the only good towers. I can tell that the multiplayer was meant for 4 players and if you got anything less than that you're going to lose.\nThe sad thing is your not just going to be killed but your going to be absolutely destroyed. They would kill us and there would still be about 50 more units still alive. To conclude this, I think Orcs Must Die! 2 did the tower defense with fps better. You felt like you could win, you felt like with one more try you could beat the enemy; in this game all I felt like was that the game was just being really cheap and unfair. I just started and the game expected prefection. Although I heard the single player was better. But again, surprise surprise, the levels are so BORING AND LONG. I couldn't recommend this.","October 17, 2014","false","2.9"," 6 of 20 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","6","20","0","0"

I am not a fan of this game although I wanted to be until I very quickly realized how they designed it. You have to be very specific with your tower placement and upgrades to be successful. The ability to play how you want to play is nearly nonexistent. It's like the developers said "we are releasing our game for you to play and you will play it how WE want you to play it, not how you want to play it". You cannot place the towers that you want and certain enemies require gun upgrades moreso than tower upgrades and so on and so forth, and those are just scratching the surface of the large amount of underlying rules that exist within this game's trial-and-error-exclusive play structure that shackle you to playing how they intend you to play and only how they intended. Throw out any thoughts of playing how you want and using any kind of common sense strategy that you have learned from over 90% of other good tower defense games out the window.\n\nNeeds more freedom 5/10","March 21, 2014","false","2.5"," 6 of 22 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","6","22","0","0"

It was totally worth it.\n\nThe game is tower defense and FPS combined. Both are well balanced and you cannot complete a single level without a good balance of the two, which is ideal. The Co-Op is quite fun too, just make sure that you can communicate properly.\n\nEach level is unique. The first 3 took me 4 hours; some trial and error involved. But, surprisingly, every time I failed I was not frustrated at all because the checkpoints are smartly and generously placed in levels. The game is really enjoyable.\n\nThe game is totally worth it and please do buy it.","January 3, 2015","true","21.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The upgrade system is intuitive and interesting as both your turrets and weapons can be upgraded, making both you and your maze a force to be reckoned with. Having a gun in your hand and seeing things in a first person perspective is really what sets this apart from the other TDs where you build your turrets and sit back, letting them do all the work. Depending on the enemy wave, you could sit back and watch your turrets annihilate the enemy, or you could build gigantic, winding maze and do all the dirty work yourself, but eventually it'll balance out to where both you and your turrets are splitting the damage fairly evenly and concentrating your upgrades on either weapons or turrets will lead to failure.\n\nAs an added bonus, the scenery is absolutely gorgeous in the surreal areas you'll be visiting; there is some astounding artistry put into this.","January 30, 2015","true","27.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is a lot of fun and if you like tower defense games and first person shooters, this is a near perfect blend betwen the two.  Offering several ways to win each round, you can play each map more than one time. .... however this is where the game has it's downfall.   For $15 you only get FOUR maps, which is the entirety of the game.  I think I had finished this game in five hours, and played through it twice in less than nine hours.   At that point I was bored with it and wished it had been much longer.\n\nUltimately I give this game 2 stars out of five.  Everything the game does, it does pretty well, but you'll chew through that content very quickly and be left hungry for more.... but not in a good way.  Ultimately the game feels half finished and I ended the game almost feeling like I had paid $15 for a demo.  This game could easily be 3 or 4 times as long with the addition of more maps.","June 7, 2011","true","12.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","4"

I have to say, though, that where this game has gone since that time is quite amazing!  It started out as a very beautiful, atmospheric, strategic tower defense game and still has all of those elements, but Coffee Stain Studios has gone completely above and beyond in developing DLC content for it.  The newest update and DLC maps are so incredible and light-years ahead of the original game.  I started playing this game the day it was released and I recommended it to friends then - I definitely recommend it now!

The difference here is the game is extremely polished, and plays relatively straight forward, I can't really elaborate since it simply provides tower defense (contruction) with hero combat (FPS). The only real flaw I can find in this game for what it is, is the forced heavy use of the FPS component (upgrading assault is pretty much necessary, and takes priority over such things as mazing, investing in tower combos).

Your goal is to kill enemy monsters before they will reach your power core. It looks like another tower defense game but not the kind you know.\n\nIt is full 3D First Person Tower Defense shooter game. You and your towers defending together in real-time action.\nYou can select up to 3 weapons for every map: choose wisely between assault guns, sniper rifles, lasers, rocket launchers, freezers and much more. Make your enemy's life a hell creating mazes and extending their path of agony.\n\nGame is divided into two parts: building and fight phase.\nWhile in build phase you can build/demolish or upgrade. You can upgrade towers and/or  your weapon. This is very important part cause every wave will encounter other group of monsters.\nDon't worry all time you have access to monsterpedia where you can check and see monster's weak spots.\n\nYou are still not convinced ... ok .. you can defend the core with your friends in co-op mode.\nGame is worth to try! Lot's of hard work but also great fun, grab all 100 achievements and be the best on Global leaderboard.\n\nGame is based on Unreal Engine 3, you know what that mean ... beautiful graphics and nice game physic.\n\nIf you are looking for similar game, that would be Orcs Must Die! 2 .\nBoth games will give you lots of fun.\n\n\nBuy It, try It, Like It, Play It.\nHave Fun.","April 7, 2015","true","25.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

FPSs strategy doesn't go beyond the immediate few seconds into the future. Yet, Sanctum takes these two drastically different genres and blends them together, covering or even elminating the drawbacks of each.\n\nIn the build phase, you plan long-term strategy. What do I build? How do I counter the upcoming enemies? Do I build, or upgrade? Then during the combat phase, you focus on typical FPS aspects: Run, jump, strafe, shoot etc.\n\nThe cherry on top is that these things play off each other. You can build towers just to do damage, or you can build them to give yourself an easier time with your gun by slowing enemies or amplifying damage. Or, you can slow or even stun enemies adjacent to high-damage towers to squeeze more out of them. Path layout is critical, yet many strategies exist. All in all, if you want an FPS that makes you think, this is one.","February 9, 2012","true","135.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So many games try to meld or blur genres and what comes out is a diluted mess of a game. Sanctum is a tower defense game, but when the hoards come you spend your time helping defend the core by sniping air units or slowing down the line of charging bad guys. Both parts of the game are equally important as the towers or your guns won't be enough to beat a level by themselves. There are only 4 maps but each has an endless mode and coop is satisfying, helping the overall replay value. Do yourself a favor and pick this one up.","May 18, 2011","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even more, the fact that you get guns doesn't really detract from the sheer fun of the Maze-Build-Upgrade gameplay that is at the heart of the genre.  Now, this one is fairly solid-- it has a mazing apparatus built into it, out of which you form your other towers, meaning no space is wasted with powerless towers-- but I wish there was slightly less focus on the gunning aspect of it.  Like I said earlier, the game fixates on this fact, and instead of allowing you to opt-out of firing alongside your towers, several waves in every attempt consist entirely of enemies you must kill yourself.","July 4, 2011","true","21.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Build and upgrade your towers between waves, and then assist your towers with killing the invaders before they destroy your base power core. The combat feels like a fast paced old school FPS. The two elements fit together nicely, for example some enemies take reduced damage from  towers until the player shoots their weak spot. And of course each different tower is better suited to killing different types of enemies. The environment can be a hazard to the player - fall off a ledge and enemies will push forward until you recover. This all allows for some varied and deep tactics. The number of maps, difficulty levels and achievements provides for many hours of replayability. The graphics and sound quality is good for an indie release, and the game is also very stable and bug free. The only major flaw is the lack of any kind of story to tie the levels together. But Sanctum is still great value for money, even at full price.","July 29, 2012","true","56.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

While unimpressive at first, I thought the original idea of merging fps shooter and tower defense could evolve. Needless to say now, evolve it did, and it has it all. Intense strategical planning, fast reaction and true aim are vital to your success on higher difficulties. The game brings a great multiplayer experience especally while playing with friends.\n\nAlthough it's tower defense, it keeps a lot of pressure on the players, as they remain the main source of damage during the 1-2 hour-long battles. The team has to focus on most important targets at a time in order to succeed. Unfortunately, there are no checkpoints in multiplayer...\n\nThe downside of Sanctum is, despite the waves of monsters being randomized, a limited amount of their variations, only a few levels and so things might get repetitive.\n\nPersonally I enjoy the game very much and prefer it over its sequel.","February 24, 2014","true","52.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The lessons that the team learned from "Sanctum" are very visible in "Sanctum 2," a noticeably more polished title. This entry in the series is a decent diversion for a day or two, but it never gets beyond that.\n\nThis is not to say that the original game is bad - it's just to point out that there are some very noticeable rough edges. In comparison to the sequel, the character handling in "Sanctum" feels clunky and imprecise. The tower building is much more of a chore, and just getting around the map feels a bit awkward.\n\nThe game pacing is also "clunky." Each map lasts for what feels like an extraordinarily long time, without really building much tension to keep things interesting. This feeling of things being overlong also tends to create outsize punishments for choosing a bad tower loadout or overall strategy. If you chase yourself into a situation that suddenly becomes unwinnable at a late wave, the reaction is NOT one of "Oh - I see what might work!" Instead, my feeling was "Ugh...I have to do all that again? *Sigh...*"\n\nPart of the problem is that the game is so contextless. I feel that it's a perfect example of a multiplayer game that just happens to have a working singleplayer mode. Unlike its sequel, "Sanctum" has no worldbuilding, characters, or sense of purpose that makes you invest in the game's progression. It's just a collection of disconnected encounters that happen to you, and while some of the defense problems are interesting to solve, there's a lot of repetition. It might be better with multiplayer co-op, where some of the social aspects serve to spice things up independent of the software.\n\nIf the gameplay was truly a blast, the above wouldn't be as much of a liability. It doesn't make it to that point, though.\n\nSo, with all the apparent negativity, why would I still click "Yes" when asked if I recommend "Sanctum?"\n\nWell, first, reviewers need a third option: A "Maybe" button. But beyond that...\n\nI do feel that "Sanctum" is worth seeing as a curiosity. It provides a kind of window into how the series was formed and refined. Play time isn't everything, but in this case, I think there's a strong correlation. "Sanctum 2" was brilliant enough to keep me playing for almost 40 hours, which is more than four times longer than I was willing to spend with "Sanctum." It may be that "Sanctum" is only about 1/4 as good as its dramatically improved sequel. It certainly feels that way to me, and maybe that's just good enough to spend a few bucks on.\n\nIn other words, the game is pretty "Eh," but I don't hate it.","June 13, 2015","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I picked it up on sale for less than a dollar. I wasn't expecting much. The screenshots and videos looked alright and the description sounded cool. Yet, I had been fooled by games like that before. I had never heard of the game before but decided to spend the extra change in my Steam Wallet on it, figuring I really wasn't losing out on anything. Am I glad I did!\n\nFirst off, let me tell you I haven't played anything quite like this before. I have played FPS's and Tower Defence's, but never together. I enjoy both, but was wary of how they would mix. Needless to say I didn't come into it with high expectations, but I should have.\n\nThe graphics are decent/good, I like them, and for less than a dollar, they are great for sure. I also really like the art style as well as alien, turret, weapon, map, and character designs. It all seems really cool, especially since your weapons and turrets do change color and look when you upgrade them.\n\nMaps have varied layouts, some with multiple paths to the end, some of which you can block off, and some with only one straight shot, and you have to maze your way from beginning to end. Some maps may have only one spawn for aliens, while another may have two or three. Another aspect I like is that you just don't build on the side of the path, you build on it, which allows you to create mazes, funnels, and plan out paths for the enemies. It also allows you to block of paths you don't want to deal with on multiple-path maps.\n\nYou have the ability to carry three different weapons and four turret desings into a match. All of these are upgradeable, which will lead to increased damage, range, fire-rate, piercing, etc. Your weapons do not have ammo, but can overheat, and upgrading them increases damage, range, and the amount of shots before overheat. One type of turret you can build is a mix of a teleporter and elevator. Basically it will lower itself, allowing you to get ontop of the turrets you build, allowing you to shoot down onto the aliens. YOu can also hit tab to go into overview mode, which shows the map, allowing you to teleport to these specific turrets.\n\nGameplay can get fast and frantic, especially if you get overrun by numbers or your design fails. Other times it can be a breeze, while you sit there taking pot-shots at oncoming aliens, while your turrets do most of the work. Each map you can play on three different difficulties, and there is also surival mode, which can really test your skills.\n\nThere is co-op multiplayer, I haven't tried it myself yet, but I plan too and it seems very fun.\n\nAll-in-all it is a very good game, a great mix of FPS and TD. A pleasant surprise for the cheap price I got it for, although I do believe it is worth full-price. There are map-pack dlc available, and I am looking forward to picking those up as well. Would recommend! 8.75/10","March 14, 2014","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The vast amount of towers, weapons, and enemies are a nice touch. There are also a ton of maps when you get the map packs, and you can play for a long time. Now down to the technical stuff.

When they promised on their forum to add new content to the game, they failed to tell their customers that it would be a la carte (DLC) - all for an additional $11. I, along with others, was enraged by this and decided to stop playing altogether. A few months later, however, I changed my mind after a recent 75% off Steam sale. I decided that paying an additional $2 for the completed game seemed reasonable. These recent improvements have indeed made Sanctum more challenging and enjoyable. Therefore, I humbly (yet grudgingly) give CSS a tip of the hat for making a good game.","November 28, 2011","true","306.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LeSharkeh/recommended/91600/","LeSharkeh","Schlechte ᖘlumm 🐝","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LeSharkeh/","375 products in account","Ok, so I decided I would redo my Sanctum 1 review since I did terrible Sanctum 2, so I'll just explain why I prefer THIS one over the 2nd one.\n\nPROS:\n\nThe game itself: I want to point this out to EVERYONE who apparently likes Sanctum 2 better, Sanctum 1 is a tower based game with FPS elements, so you can help your towers out as well as have something to do than just sit there.  The 2nd one is FPS based with towers involved and I HATE that, the best part about the first one was the huge maps, level up weapons, level up towers and killingfloors to high levels to do a s%#ton of damage with, teleport around the place getting in enemies faces, get infront of them to block them off so they couldn't get closer, etc. and that's why I loved it, the FPS part was just there for some entertainment and to help out friends/towers so you would have something to do\n\nLarge maps: A good chunk of the maps in this game are actually really big, seriously, some of the maps are ginormous and you have to be careful about where you put your towers, as well as where you should stand to help them out.\n\nWeapons/Pick your own weapons: There are multiple weapons to pick from, i'm not going to list them all but i'll say my favorties are R.E.X., the Tesla Gun, and the Sniper, and leveling them up means more damage and more ammo, as well as quicker reload times.  And to top it all off you can pick your weapons instead of being forced 1 weapon, AND you also get 3 weapons instead of 2, making it more fun.\n\nLevel up weapons: This is another thing I adored about the first one, the level up system for weapons.  How this works is that you switch to your weapon inbetween rounds with SHIFT, and hold LMB (if you have enough money) And it upgrades it to the next level, the higher the level the more damage you do with it, there is a limit but it does a lot of damage.\n\nNO. F%$KING. TOWER LIMIT: I hated this SO MUCH about the 2nd, there isn't a tower/block limit, there isn't, if you have the money and it isn't blocking the enemies path then you can put it there, and that's why I liked it, I hate how the 2nd one you have a limit, why a limit? That was one of the great things about the first one.\n\nNo stupid boss fights: There are no boss fights in this game, and that's another thing I like and don't like, I wish there was a big enemy to fight but in the 2nd one he's just a a$$hole.  Me and my friends spent 20 minutes in Sanctum 2 on the last wave and putting towers in places and making a longer maze for the boss, well apparently the boss gave us a middle finger and plowed through it all, making all of our time and money utterly useless, after we saw that we quit and played the first game again.\n\nTowers:  Like I said in the first statement that this is a Tower based game with FPS elements, which means the towers do a good chunk of work and you are the support instead of it being vice versa.  There are multiple types of towers, my personal favorties are the killing floor which sits on the ground, and any enemy that runs over it takes damage, AND slows him down for a few seconds, and theres also this one with a long a$$ neck that pretty snipe enemies from across the map in a few hits.  There are others of course, try em out!\n\nTeleport system: If you fall off the map or are wanting to go up to the front/back of the complex to get at enemies or just for the fun of it you can teleport around if you put down some teleport pads, makes it easy to swap around the map and help out friends or to get to enemies quickly instead of running there.\n\nYou can't die:  Yup, you aren't able to die at all and I like that a lot, it doesn't put a whole lot of tension or anything, if you fall off the map you just pick a place to teleport at with no worries.\n\nCore: The Core is what you are trying to protect the aliens from, if too many get in it explodes and you lose, the bigger the enemy the more health it takes off, and you can't get any back, so keep those b@$#ards away from it at all costs.\n\nNo timer: I hated this about the 2nd as well, in the first inbetween rounds you get no timer, as much time as you need to set up your maze for enemies or put towers in places, get to certain high points for sniping, anything.  In the 2nd inbetween rounds half the time you get like 30 seconds to do whatever it is you have to before it starts and I hated that.\n\nEnemy hits: If a enemy hits you you don't lose health or anything, he just knocks you back and shakes your camera around, making it a little woozy, then when your senses come back you can go after the guy that hit you.\n\nCONS:\n\nTeleport pads: At times when I was playing I would hug against a wall so I wouldn't get knocked back, but I ran back somehow cause a telepad came down to pick me up and I went back too far and into the hoard on the other side and I kind of got stuck.  I don't know if this is a nitpick or something that people hate cause my friends do it constantly as well and they get annoyed with it.\n\nTowers: Some towers feel utterly useless, for instance there is a slow-pad for the floor like a Killing Floor is used, it slows the enemies down alot but doesn't do damage, when the Killing Floor does damage and slows them down abit.  And some are useful for only certain types, for instance gattling guns are for ground units only, and missile launchers for air targets only, some of them are mixed though, so they hit both air and ground units.\n\nLonger waves mean harder enemies: When you upgrade all of your towers and weapons you would imagine you would be set, sadly that isn't true, as waves go on enemies get harder and harder with each wave, one time I had all of my towers (except 2-3) and all of my weapons upgraded and I was expecting to wipe the floor with everyone, but halfway through the wave the enemies were getting past my maze pretty quickly, and still had chunks of health left so I had to go back to the core and pick them off one by one, I lost sadly.  I would recommend you play with friends that way you can all gang up on the aliens.\n\nWHAT I THINK:  I think this was the actual good game of the 2, even half of my friends who played the 1st and 2nd prefer the 1st one instead, I still play this game on occassion because it's still entertaining to me, and I love it for that, it has quite high replayability, and the text-to-voice chat system is just downright hilarious, I give this game a 8/10, it needs some fixing with some things but it's still very fun all around.

The co-op is fun with a few mates, but the strategy is basic at best. Simply make your maze as long as possible and spam turrets everywhere - the more the merrier. Since waves are generally mixed enemy types, there's no real need to redesign your defence at all after each wave, just keep adding to it. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, but there doesn't seem to be enough thoughtful play here to keep me at it for too long.\n\nNice idea, but poor execution.\n\n5/10","July 21, 2011","false","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The newest update and DLC maps are so incredible and light-years ahead of the original game.

The difference here is the game is extremely polished, and plays relatively straight forward, I can't really elaborate since it simply provides tower defense (contruction) with hero combat (FPS). The only real flaw I can find in this game for what it is, is the forced heavy use of the FPS component (upgrading assault is pretty much necessary, and takes priority over such things as mazing, investing in tower combos). Great game and great price too, a definite recommendation.","July 17, 2011","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

There are two modes, where you put towers and then a second where you fight the monsters. You can upgrade weapons and towers against stronger enemies.

The enemies you've seen in first map are the same you'll see at the end. There are few varities of monsters, mostly stronger versions as the battle goes on. Furthermore you get no income for killing monsters, you just get a static amount for completing each section. Each level typically has 20 sections and they all get very tedious because you cannot speed it up. If you want a good action/tower defense game go with Orcs Must Die 2. But not this game. 5/10.","July 30, 2014","true","158.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is a FPS version of a tower defense game, though it is FPS, the game concentrates more on your tactical thinking and strategy over how fast you can aim and kill an enemy which is what makes this game great for stategy lovers, I find the single player fun and it's even better when you go into co-op mode with a friends.","May 10, 2012","true","13.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It supports up to four player co-op, and this is how you need to play. Solo, it's a bit too dry, but the second you add another person in, it gets so much better.

The map artwork is visually wonderful and map design is suitably puzzling in the possibilities and limitations of maze layout.

I really love the freedom to choose your play style in this game.  First you get to design the maze that the monsters run through, then as you play through waves, you choose whether to upgrade your towers, or your guns, essentially letting you choose how much you want the game to be fps/td.  There are also lots of hidden secrets for you to find, and achivements to hunt if thats your thing.  The fps aspect is different from conventional fps in a few ways.  Most of the monsters do not attack you, making it more like a target practice game.  Every enemy has a weak spot, which can make the sniper rifle a very fun weapon to utilize.  Also, the levels in general just look cool.  Some are very pretty flowery forests, while some are very impressive techy levels.  Overall a great game.","February 27, 2014","true","145.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Second if you like FPS and also like to play RTS then this is very much the game for you. Being able to strategize your defense but also being a part of it is a very different perspective and for an Indie developer to have it come together so well the first time around is amazing. The game implements tower defense as much as it does the FPS aspects. Allowing yourself to use certain blocks to double if not triple damage to your weapons and still balance it in a fashion to where its not always enough. This game is a must buy for entering the Sanctum series, especially with the amazing sales its often on. Wholly Recommended.","December 24, 2013","true","37.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
