As in more complex maps, turns can take up to an hour, it just does not make sense to us. a Dev said,\n\nThis is one of the dumbest things I've ever seen. If we want to spend a couple hours in a game why not let us. I know it may not be for everyone but the option should still be there. Especially since the game claims to have online multiplayer. This is borderline false advertising. As even if you are passing your save back and forth you are still only playing single player. No real time play or competitiveness. And you have to use outside software. This ruins the game. The ignorance of the developers to assume this would be enough is just that, ignorant.\n","November 26, 2013","false","0.6"," 200 of 238 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","200","238","0","0"

I mean... is trying to be. The problem is, this game has nothing original in it. Its a copy paste of Advance Wars for the Gameboy Advance... except even more dull. Now before you get harsh on me, I actually ...kinda... like this game. Ive played it, I have tried to enjoy it. I have had people comment on why I enjoy self torture for playing it. So, I have given it a chance.\n\nProblem 1: This game is a multiplayer turn based strategy where the single player slowly teaches you in 16 missions how to play multiplayer. ...There is no real multiplayer to play.. Also, I could probably teach you how to play in like 4 missions.. maybe if I am going slow. For those of us who have the game and have played the genre, we knew by mission 4 or whatever how to use indirect units.. we knew they couldn't move and attack the same turn, we didnt need 2 missions for the different ranges of indirect units.\n\nProblem 2: THIS GAME IS BORING AND SLOW. I have spent hours, playing 1 single mission because the AI refuses to die even when I have 30 tanks and it has maybe 2. Everything has a damage cap of like 35% damage. I could drop a nuke (not actually in this game, but if it was it would suck) and it would do ..meh, on a good day, 50% damage. So if both sides have plenty of units (which all need selected, moved, and attacked with every single turn) it takes.. forever. I turned off the enemy turn animations and the game still takes hours. Its insane.\n\nProblem 3: There is nothing in this game. Imagine a chess game with only pawns. Oh, you can get big pawns and cool looking pawns, but there are no queens or bishops. Wouldn't that be a boring game of chess that you'd be like "man, lets go play a real chess match" ..long story short and to cut the metaphor.. thats this game.\n\nTL:DR - don't bother, this game sucks. ..and its sad too, because I would love to see this type of game done well.","April 14, 2014","false","9.9"," 64 of 67 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","64","67","0","2"

I myself only bought this because I got a 75% coupon and I still kind of regret the 1,25 EUR I spent on it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/burshoo/recommended/46440/","burshoo","Bushro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/burshoo/","155 products in account","I got this on a coupon. I can't even remember what I paid, but it certainly wasn't much. Now, I'm not going to pretend that this is the outright worst game ever made, especially amongst these other reviews, but make no mistake; This is a bad game.\n\nThere were some genuinely fun moments, and those were when the game played to its strengths, forcing me to take into account terrain, vehicle strength and driving distance. That's it.\n\nThe bad:\nThe AI doesn't know what to do with itself, choosing to focus on the nearest threat and hammer away, turning most battles into an endurance test where the player must repeat a working technique over and over (17 campaign missions). I wouldn't complain about this, but for strategy games, depth is needed, and there is very little to be had here, so working with a limited number of options (both in game and in the menus) as long as the game can last is just tedious. A few levels into it, I finally activated the option that removed the pointless driving animations, but everything still took so freaking long. Having to watch the enemy cycle through every one of their units, watch battles exponentially slow because health is directly tied to damage output, and having to make "selections" when there is only one option for an available action is just boring.\n\nThe campaign story cutscenes are hardly worth mentioning. The characters are vapid, their "personalities" cliché and unrelatable. However, I really shouldn't be criticizing the story, as it seems that it was just developed around the game. There is nothing wrong with that, but it can be done a lot better than this.\n\nNormally, I'd uninstall a game from my computer when I've gotten all the Steam achievements for it. There are none for this game, thank God. Instead, the game offers in-game "achievements" for beating levels under certain conditions, which rewards the player with concept art that can be found in a few minutes on the internet. It's not amazing work, but even being the completionist I am, this gave me little incentive to keep playing. As such, and due to some things mentioned further down, this is going to be one of the few games which I will never touch again.\n\nA bit of replay value can be found outside of the campaign, in the form of simple maps that can just be played to your heart's content... y'know, if that appeals to you. The multiplayer, on the other hand, is outdated and dead, and that needs no further explanation.\n\nEverything else is downright broken. I had to look on the forums for an explanation on how to get it running, which is no biggie. I've had to do that with plenty of other games. Then I opened the level editor, which should be the saving grace of any mediocre grid-based game. It crashed. Worse yet, I couldn't open the game afterward. I'm certain that looking for a solution or just reinstalling would remove that fiasco, but at this point I just don't even feel like doing it. I really do not.\n\nIn a term, it's "wasted potential". Most of the game is not worth playing, and the few moments that are worth experiencing can be found in almost any other strategy game.","November 26, 2014","false","1.5"," 30 of 31 people (97%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","97","30","31","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vaxxi/recommended/46440/","vaxxi","Felicia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vaxxi/","255 products in account","I’ve played a fine number of the turn-based strategy games provided in it’s small market and I have a deep appreciation for them because of how easy they are to pick up for a casual gamer and how much depth they offer for anyone willing to take the risk of playing with a more hardcore approach. I was curious and slightly amused to say the least about the bold claim that Future Wars was able to “take turn based strategy gaming away from the micromanagement overkill” and “open the game for newcomers while appealing to the hardcore gamer just the same!" So after playing the game I can safely say that Future Wars isn't anything that I expected at all and is actually a very pretentious trainwreck of a game.\n\nRadon labs, the creators of Future Wars, put a lot of effort into advertising it's "easy rock-paper-scissors" combat system being able to attract hordes of gamers with it. Though sadly this claim fell short of the company's expectations or they're probably lying because in all reality the game doesn't have much of a combat system at all. Looking through the game's "Unit Information" you'll discover that the only information your units have are a class type, it's attack range and the number of spaces it can move. In other words, the combat in this game is based off of a random roll of the die. This is no exaggeration either. it got painfully obvious that no matter what units I was using they had no real effect on the tide of battle as soon as I clocked in over 40 minutes on a single mission. In one of the missions, where I was required to capture an enemy base and eliminate all enemy units they would constantly spawn wave after wave of classes from their factory each turn. Eventually when combat actually engaged regardless of what environment I was in (which in theory give you defense boosts) or if the unit I had was “stronger” or “weaker” than the enemy's the damage being clocked in from both sides would be a completely random range of high or low damage.\n\nThis completely destroyed any difficulty the game could possibly have and made the entire game unplayable as the game became an endless cycle of build, attack, and rebuild that would never go anywhere because of how little damage would always be dealt and with how many units can be spawned with the constantly endless flow of cash. Future Wars also had little things that could've made the game a little easier to stomach but were totally forgotten. Such as no skip buttons for the very long battles, no indication of who can be moved or not, having to play every unit before ending your turn, or the camera forcing you to pan back to a unit every time they take any sudden movement are only a few of the game's unneeded annoyances. It also doesn’t help that the HUD is nearly impossible to work with. There is little to no information for what each button and symbol in the game’s menus stand for forcing you to take a wild guess with the small and tiny thumbnails sitting by by numbers that had no real meaning to you. Though considering that even environments with high numbers by the shield symbol on the HUD made no difference over how much damage was given they probably don't even really matter anyways.\n\nThe game also looks very ugly, the textures of the objects in the game are very smudgy and pixelated even on computers that can meet the game’s mind boggling 3.0ghz processor requirement and the character design looks goofy with everyone dressed up as superheroes and wearing sun visors in dark rooms. Then there's the story, you can't really actually care about anything bad happening to the characters since all the battles are done on computer simulations and have zero real life consequences on the characters even when a "bad guy" is introduced. The dialogue is also very, very nonsensical with a bunch of weird comments made by the characters or looking like it comes out of a 12 year old's stories on her long forgotten Livejournal page. Future Wars simply isn't a a good game, it's not even one that really needs to exist. It tries it's hardest to fix something that was never broken to begin with and fails miserably by not even providing any depth to it's broken core. It's ugly, it's broken, its built off of zero combat direction, and it's story is badly written that even those who received the game in a bundle or got it on sale for less than a dollar will feel like they've been ripped off. The turn based strategy genre is already small as it is and offers far better titles that do so much more that even considering this game is unnecessary.","December 7, 2014","false","2.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

In fact, it's so much like Advance Wars that it falls in the "blatant ripoff" category. The formula is the same, the strategy is the same, even the maps are the same. The only difference is the design, where the bright and distinct pixel art is replaced by 3D models that all look the same. What I saw of the story was stupid and pointless.\n\nThe games in the Advance Wars series are wonderful strategy games. Sadly, Future Wars just doesn't quite live up to the game it emulates.

If you're looking for some turn-based strategy gaming similar to the Advance Wars series, but for your PC, then this is worth your time. There are big similarities but also some differences in the game rules compared to Advance Wars.\nTo those who know Advance Wars, I list some differences:\nThere are no naval units\nOnly helicopters and air transports as air units, there are no bombers or fighters.\nAll units are produced in factories, there are no airports. All units can heal in cities or factories, in contrast to Advance Wars, where air units only heal while on airports.\nIf a unit inside any kind of transport has boarded the transport in a previous turn (not the current turn), then after unloading it CAN MOVE AND ATTACK, I love that detail!\nHealing does not cost a corresponding fraction of the unit worth's money, like in Advance Wars.\n\nDownsides of this game:\nAI is weak\nThe Campaign is only 16 missions short (and the story is as bad and cheesy as Advance Wars, but also, luckily, irrelevant to the actual gameplay). There are about the same number of additional missions in "Free Play" mode, and the campaign missions can also be played in Free Play mode (selectable side for AI and player, multiplayer options,...)\nThe Interface is a bit clunky, not as elegant and informative as Advance Wars. But it does the job and doesn't stand in the way.\n\nWith some more polish and missions, this would be a great title on PC. As it is, it's only "ok", worth playing if you like Advance Wars and ready to try a similar game on PC. I enjoyed it but probably I won't replay it.\nI have not tried out any of the multiplayer options.","May 15, 2014","true","36.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The game is also incredibly boring when it's not your turn; unlike in, say, Final Fantasy Tactics, there's little in the way of eye-candy to pass the time with (the game is quite ugly, actually), and as your opponents seem to have different abilities from any available to you at the time, it's fruitless to try to glean strategies from them.\n\nI spent $0.50 on this game during a sale, and I want even that pittance back. I cannot recommend this game for all but the most ardent collectors - not for advanced strategy gamers as they'll quickly tire of the basic mechanics and not for beginners as the game is very confusing and non-engaging.","February 28, 2014","false","0.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I feel it has gotten to the point where those things are your only options. But the brave devs of this game had another thing coming. They delivered a game that did away with all those things. I play this game for hours a day. Don't believe the hour counter. I have another file that I set aside just for this game.\n\nAs for the multiplayer, I love how they removed all the functionality that bogs down my CPU and traded it for a highly efficient system where you take your turn then email the map to your friend so they can do the same thing. Why didn't anyone think of this sooner? It works so well!\n\nThey have a very effective and realistic rock, paper, scissors play style. I honestly feel like I am a real army commander. You can't beat this kind of immersion. Not to mention, the cutscene graphics are amazing. I have never seen visuals as real as Future Wars' cutscenes. (also, the female characters are hot). I don't know why you would spend your money on one of those feature packed games like skyrim or minecraft when you can lose your job, house, wife & kids, and even a kidney to this game. Sometimes I buy ecxtra copies of this game just to show my love and support.\n\nI can't even begin to tell you how deep the campaign is. It's so beautiful and touching. I was in tears by the end.\n\nThere is no reason not to buy this game and unless you hate yourself, get this game. Get it now. Get a copy for a friend. All those other reviews are lies made by other game companies and the people don't even know what they are talking about.\n\nGameplay 10/10\nGraphics 11/10\nUnits 10/10\nMaps 10/10\nImmersion 10/10\nCharacters 10/10\nSound Track 10/10\nMultiplayer 10/10\nCampaign 10/10\nEfficiency of design 10/10\n10/10 10/10\nThis game is perfection, and some. 11/10 I bought it again... again... and again.","March 28, 2014","true","0.2"," 15 of 32 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","15","32","2","1"

Not this game, I'm afraid because I bought this game for 50 cents and already I wanted to put this game down. First off, the setting of the game is really really stupid. In games like Advance wars, it would usually be set in an actual war, this game is set in a military academy and tries to make fell more like those high school or college senarios where you are this student who's gonna turn out to be the best of the bunch. The characters are really dull and somewhat boring. The gameplay is a result of test for the military academy and are really dull to play. The designs for the units  are just ugly and the tanks don't feel like they belong to this supposit setting that the game is set in.
