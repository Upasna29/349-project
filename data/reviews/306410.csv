Resolution is low with only fullscreen or window options. Objects have no consistent size or even perspective which leads to some confusion of what an item actually is. This is not even considerering certain items which are so badly defined you willl be wondering what it even is. This leads to more random clicking than actually finding the items.\nStory wise, dont bother.  No voice acting, no animation. Intro text is a few short words that you need to click 3 times just to finish one sentence. Ending is yeah you rescued us, thanks, game over. Literally.\nGameplay is abrupt, again no animations. You will be constantly running back and forth to the same hidden object puzzle, which will have all the items in the same places as last time you did it. Puzzles are mostly easy with the only exception being one requiring tiles to be associated with elements, and no clues as how to align them. I ended up skipping that one.  Lack of animations again come into play on a few puzzles leading more to irritaion than puzzling.\nI definately recommed looking at some of the other HOG's that actually look like they were made this millenium.","October 7, 2014","false","5.8"," 36 of 43 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","36","43","0","0"

Storywise it's really lacking - no other charaters, only a few letters here and there that acts as clues to an otherwise weak story.\nWhy do I still recommend it?\nMainly because there is no " Dunno" or "Meh" recommendation. The game just doesn't cut for full price - but it's quite good if you can get is for or under 1$/€, even better if from a bundle.  The graphics are quite good, but sadly it lacks animation - things just change instanteniously. Music is surprisingly pleasant, but sometimes it just turns itself off for minutes...\nStill, the game's main strenghts are it's hidden object scenes. They are numerous, I think there are at least 20 of them. And they are hard - not really unfairly hard, but really challenging.\nI'm not really fond of the numeric scoring - but this game would end up somewhere below 50/100 - for every good point there is at least one bad. If you can ignore the negatives, it's good for a single-time experience.\nIf you're looking for a game with challenging hidden object scenes (and you don't care about the story) buy it in a bundle or during a sale - if you're looking for a game with a nice story, you have to look for it somewhere else.","February 26, 2015","true","6.8"," 28 of 31 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","28","31","0","1"

Buy at your own risk.\n\nReview There is very little good to say about Crystals of Time. The soundtrack is pretty nice, but extremely limited, often stopping for minutes of a time leaving you in silence. The story is pretty much non-existent and the characters uninteresting.\n\nThe worst part is the gameplay and the presentation however as the game is littered with horrible design decisions. The area is very open with many rooms to explore and return to. Unfortunately, the areas that need items are often very vague as to what is needed (“I should find the missing item first.” is the games favorite line… instead of giving some kind of hint what I’m actually trying to do there) and HOG item zones will activate with little rhyme or reason. For example there is a greenhouse which when you first visit does not have a HOG zone… but one activates later without giving you a single indication or reason to return to the greenhouse. Thus, you are forced to use hints or to go through every single room each time you are missing an item. As moving around in the game is very slow (the minimap can only take you to a few select locations) and the locations are very uninteresting to explore the game pretty much forces you to use hints a lot.\nThe minigames and HOG sections themselves are uninspired. The items you search for are randomized and when you return to search the same area you often have to look for the same items again (even items that you previously took and used). Many objects are badly sized, coloured strangely, sometimes wrongly named and there is very low sensitivity to your clicks, e.g. you have to click very precisely and sometimes that is not enough. I once clicked 5 times on a chain and it simply refused to work making me believe it was the wrong item. It wasn’t.\n\nThe time travelling gem that changes the scenes is nice… I guess. However, very little is done with it in the sections I played (I only found the first crystal before I finally decided this game was not worth playing). Only means you have to keep an eye on the crystal to see if you can change the time in a room. Anyway, I bought the game for about 1 Euro and still feel a bit cheated. Avoid.","October 10, 2015","false","2.0"," 24 of 28 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","24","28","0","1"

Sometimes clicks failed to register, so I kept searching for that object even though I had already spotted and clicked it. Unnecessary confusion.\n\nThe game often has you revisit hidden object scenes and resets them each time, so you'll be looking for the same objects over and over. This makes for a repetitive and tedious experience. Not helping matters is the fact that much of your time is spent looking for X number of copies of a given macguffin before you can proceed, which just pads the game out further.\n\nCrystals of Time has made looking for hidden objects, the core element of its genre, into annoying busywork.

Sadly, "Crystals of Time" is not one of them.\n\nFirst of all, the game pretty much leaves you to your own devices for the most part. It's hard to tell which rooms you're supposed to go to next; I kept having to press the hint button to figure out where I was supposed to go. Not only that, you can't easy-jump from room to room using the map; it only leads to certain general areas of the house, the garden, etc. As a result, there's a lot of backtracking involved, and it quickly gets annoying.\n\nSecond, the so-called story in this game really has no bearing when you actually start playing. First of all, why does a thief need to break into an abandoned mansion? And those "crystals of time" that are supposed to be super-important? Yeah, you spend most of the game looking for the crystals, but actual time traveling literally only happens in three rooms of the game. Nowhere else! This results in the ending being one of the most anticlimactic I have ever seen. We're introduced to all these characters and pieces of a story, but they don't seem to completely fit together.\n\nAs for the puzzles themselves, they're fine. I was pretty much able to figure them all out without any difficulty. But if you like a good story to go with your hidden-object adventure games, I do not recommend this one. At least, not unless you like sitting for thirty seconds waiting for the hint button to recharge.","June 17, 2014","false","2.0"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","15","22","0","1"

I had to search the same place and play the “click the objects (a minigame that has a similar rules to that of "I Spy")” minigame over and over again in order to get certain items. This process made me very frustrated and gave me the strong urge to quit the game without even seeing the ending.\nMoreover, the unhelpful details in the “click the objects” minigame made the game somewhat annoying to play.

I trade spare bundle keys a lot and thought well, I may as well get rid of a spare key for a new game so I thought I’d give it a try. I honestly think it’s not that bad.\n\nThe story line is somewhat intriguing. Again, for as far as HOGs go. They are usually pretty cheesy storylines and they usually all fall under the same categories. Master thief, ancient treasure hunter, detective and so on. It isn’t an amazingly riveting plot, but it’s not too shabby.\n\nItems blend in well and the art is nice, which is always a good bonus for HOGs. A few items blended in a little too well but it wasn’t a problem. It still didn’t take that long to find, just slowed down the momentum.\n\nThe puzzles and game mechanics are good, a few interesting puzzles in there. Nothing remarkably challenging though.\n\nOne thing that did kind of bug me with this game was the backtracking. Oh the backtracking… it kind of felt at points like you had to go back and check every scene you’ve already been in to be able to find everything you needed. Which was a tad tedious. The main setting is in a massive house, so backtracking and checking every room after you’ve made some progress wasn’t all that fun and took away from the feel of the game a bit.\n\nBut apart from that I would say I still recommend this one. It’s a nice addition to the genre. Although I would have to agree with quite a few people out there saying this isn’t the best HOG on the market. It’s decent, but it’s not the best. If you are a real fan of the genre and buy them more for the object finding (like I do) then the storyline/everything else then I’d say yes.\n\nHidden object games are pure cheese as it is, I don’t imagine many proper gamers actually enjoy these kind of games and I don’t really blame them. I can’t imagine most major gamers hopping out of COD and into this. So if you’re that kind of gamer and are looking to at least try this genre, I would say to go with a different, higher rated one.\n\nAll in all it’s decent.\n\n\nTL;DR : OH THE BACKTRACKING… the story is alright, the art/item blending is decent, the mechanics and puzzles are good. If you can get past the backtracking then it’s a decent addition to the genre. Get it. Do it.

You'll see we all had the same impressions.\n\nThis is one of those mixed point & click / HOGs. Actually you'll spend less time in HO scenes and more time navigating rooms and interacting with stuff to unlock stuff. Which would be okay, if the developers didn't mess it up.\n\nUsually it's normal to think "hmm, what do I do now?" in adventure games, because there's something we're not remembering. It's part of the fun. But in this game? You'll stay stuck until you click "Hint", and it's the game's fault.

Nothing that will make you pause.\nPlenty of locations, and a map screen to quickly teleport (this is also a negative, more below.)\nThank goodness for that Hint button. Use it liberally, and don't feel bad about it, because the game is designed in a dumb way. (more below)\nThe bad\nHO scenes will unlock without any sort of notification, in places where they weren't active before. There's dozens of locations, and at any time any of them can activate a new HO scene. You'll have NO IDEA unless you keep running around checking all the locations... or clicking "Hint". I can't tell you how annoying this is, to doubt yourself as a player. "I can't tell what to do now... is it because I need to remember something? Or is it the game being STUPID again?"\nFor a HO game, the HO scenes are not that many. And you'll be repeating them several times, and hunting the SAME objects. At least other games that make you repeat a HO scene make sure you're hunting a different set of objects each time.\nLet me repeat once again the general feeling of being lost and confused that accompanies you constantly in this game, and not in a good or fun way. If you manage to push through to the (very abrupt and poor) ending, I'm sure you will be out of any ♥♥♥♥s to give by the end, like I was.\nThere's a map screen to help with all the tedious back and forth between all the locations - but the map only has a handful of places to teleport to, out of more than 20. So you'll still have to click click click through the slow transitions.\nStory is not really something you look for in HOGs, and it's not strong here either.\nThis game left me ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off.

At random times, when you need an item, you will have to go back there and play a new HOG in the same location. No, most of these do not have a logical connection so you'll have to go through most of them again and again seraching for the elusive HOG.

It's extremely forgiving- to the point where there's no time limit, no penalty for errors or hint abuse, and no bad end.\n\nYou play as the daughter of a very successful cat burglar, who has vanished on his latest caper- a house on the coastline of the northeastern United States, where a scientist and his helper have vanished.  Your job is to collect hidden objects and find key items in those puzzles to open the path in front of you, leading towards your father and discovering just what happened and whatever went wrong to get the mansion in this state.\n\nThere's a fair amount of puzzle-solving, but the game will tell you outright if you're missing any pieces to the puzzle you're working on- so if you still need other pieces, you'll be able to find out right away instead of wrestling with it for three hours and realizing then that you were missing a piece.   There is plenty of backtracking, and none of the items ever change places.\n\nIf you can grab it for five bucks, it's a good game for the younger crowd, but those looking for a deeper offering may want to give this one a pass.","October 5, 2014","true","8.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Half the game is spent walking from place to place trying to find the hidden object spot that's reactivated; you'll replay most of them 3-4 times each, and it's always the same. No new items, old items are never removed. The game is obsessively linear; even if you have an AHA! moment and know you'll need something, you can't grab it. :( And when you need several items in a row, it doesn't activate all the rooms at once, only one at a time, so you can be led along like a good doggie and never veer off the path. The time mechanic would have been kind of cool, but it was woefully underused. I don't even need to go into the story, which is appropriately bad for this kind of game; the ending was a joke, though, basically "congratulations!" then dumping you back to the title screen. Graphics are mediocre; it usually wasn't hard to tell what something was, but everything looked cut-pasted with no consistent lighting, plus the usual mindlessly hiding long things on edges.\n\nThe worst part was the misspellings and the wrong words, like calling a butternut squash a pumpkin, or a cutting board a "trencher", or a vaccuum tube an "electric lamp", which is actually an important story item. It adds up to some real confusion, and makes you wonder how much of the game was just phoned it with a visit to wikipedia.\n\nThe music is actually pretty good, rather haunting. If it wasn't punctuated by long segments of no music at all, it'd be the highlight of the game.\n\nIf you're desperate for a puzzle, give it a shot, but there are many better options.","November 6, 2014","false","3.9"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Most of the item puzzles are fairly obtuse; I rarely felt like I had outwitted a puzzle rather than solving it by brute trial and error.  You constantly have to backtrack to find new items that popped up in a room you've already been to many times; the hint system is the saving grace here, as hints were given quite generously, and if I had needed to actually search through each room everytime I accomplished something, I probably would have quit long before the end.\n\nThe minigame puzzles were for the most part enjoyable, if a bit easy.\n\nThe hidden object sections felt too numerous; I would occasionally run into three within a five minute time span, or that's what it felt like at least.  Sometimes the wording on the puzzles was odd, but that is likely just an issue of regional dialects.  In America we would never call a butternut squash a pumpkin.\nI had an few issues at times with click detection on some of the hidden object puzzles, which could be troublesome when I wasn't 100% certain that I was clicking on the right object.  One in particular had me looking for a briefcase.  I clicked on it several times and then decided that that wasn't the right object.

There are a handful of puzzles, the difficulty of which range from very easy to moderately difficult, yet the mere activity of going through and solving them is satisfying enough. While the game is pretty straight forward, with only the occasional possibility of getting stumped, you can use the time crystal Ashley Ford starts out with to give you a hint--these are visual cues that trigger the player's understanding of what to do next instantaneously. There were, perhaps, a few too many of the "hidden object" sessions, but these are trifling and take only a few minutes to complete, even when you're presented with two or three to complete in a row. A big hint I would have found useful: if you come to a place where you seem to have run out of things to do, return to the places where you have scavenged for hidden objects before; often you will have to do another round of object finding in order to come up with the next item needed to proceed in the game.\n\nOne of the strongest elements to Crystals of Time is the artwork. As the entire experience plays out in a series of still pictures (with some minor animation at times), the player is treated with a wide array of stunning visuals that range from the vast, brooding insides of a sprawling mansion, to a glittering moonlit coast. It is an art style which is relatively simple, but detailed and colorful enough--with an excellent use of source-light shadings--that it never gets tedious to look at. In addition to the art, the soundtrack is both simple yet effective, adding to the atmosphere of the game in a substantial way. And, although there are only three-or-four songs to be had, the game designers were smart enough to allow for long stretches of silence between each play so that they don't get redundant.\n\nThe story, on the other hand, isn't very remarkable. It's pretty shallow and without any real character depth or interaction. Still, in a simple hidden object game such as this, it's not really all that imperative. The surface-deep story matches the overall casual nature of the game, and it's not really a knock against it; this game is light fair, enjoyed best when entering into it with a hankering for a nice, noncommittal gaming experience. I did, however, run into one glitch which probably won't happen reliably with every play-through: the journal somehow got locked up halfway through the game, and with each proceeding entry, the text overlapped upon the previous entry, rendering the book virtually useless. Thankfully, the game is clear enough that it did little to hinder my progress.\n\nAfter all's said and done, Crystals of Time comes recommended at it's cheap $4.99 price-point, and is a no-brainer on sale for two dollars or less.","August 26, 2014","true","6.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

Frustrating because it could have been so much better. The graphics and music are both fitting and immersive and the story is interesting.\n\nThen the annoyances kick in.\nFor large parts of the game, there is no direction. You find objects but have no idea what they interact with without using the hint button.\nThere is no indication as to how many parts/pieces you need to complete objectives. Leaving you running around the map with pieces, only to be told you need more, or running around the map looking for pieces when you already have enough.\nSome interactive areas give no hint they are interactive unless you click on them.\nIf you are stuck ... don't worry, you just have to re-visit "every" location in case a HO scene has appeared since you last visited. Missing a piece? explore the entire map for a HO scene .... and that leads to the next problem.\nThere are a lot of HO scenes ... and that wouldn't normally be a problem, but this game repeats the scenes. You might have to revisit the same HO scene 4 times during gameplay, and not only does it use the same scenes over and over, it uses the same objects! So 80-90% of the objects you are required to find, are the same objects, in the same places, as the previous 2 or 3 or 4 times you did it!\nSome objects have poor click detection. You see the fishing rod, you click the fishing rod, nothing happens. You have to re-click in different areas on the object before it is found.\nSome of descriptions are un-clear, and the most annoying feature is that sometimes objects with same description are in the scene, but it will only accept one of them. i.e. Find the "peppers". Is it the large red pepper in the middle? no, it's the jar of peppers on the shelf. Find the "nuts". Is it the large bowl of hazelnuts? no, it's the walnuts in the corner.\nWhat's a sac? .... hint .... oh, you mean "sack"\n\nThis game could have been so much better, and that's what's annoying about it. Playing through it was an exercise in patience more than enjoyment, and the ending!?!?!? seriously?!?!? .... the payoff at the end was disappointing to say the least.\n\nIf you like HOGs, try something else, and if you must, try to pick this one up in a bundle or on sale.","April 18","false","2.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Finally I found the ending a bit abrupt.\n\nGameplay suggestions:\nPlay on normal and use hints - after you have explored the area the thoroughly it is really useful to know where the next hidden object part is because you will be revisiting places multiple times and its tedious to figure out where the next on is.  Also if you come down to the last object and you think its not registering - use a hint; it might not be registering correctly.","November 1, 2014","true","14.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

That is to say, as part of a bundle or a really huge discount, because it actually does have enough positive elements to it to be worth owning, even while there are major negatives. To begin with the bad, I need to say that the game is linear to a ridiculous extent. Basically, you find hidden objects at a location to gain a needed item, wander around/backtrack to find the next hidden object area that is active or reactivated (yes, you read that right, and you will in fact play most of the same areas multiple times by the end), and need to solve these hidden object games, mini-games, and collect items, as well as performing tasks, all in one precise order, regardless of if you already know you need something that you find before the official time to collect it, etc.\n\nOn the bright side, there is a very generous hint system available, that will tell you exactly where you need to go or what you need to do next, which saves you a great deal of random backtracking to find the next location. Also, there are elements to the story that are fun, and the minigames that make intermittent appearances offer a nice change of pace from the hidden object scenes. So, it is not a great example within the genre, but is fun enough if you get your hands on it as a bargain title.","March 18, 2015","true","2.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The story seems like it was added as an afterthought, there's a short introduction and the end is as abrupt as a bucket of cold water to the face.\n\nMost of the puzzles are far too easy, and the constant back and forth between locations just to check out which hidden object images are currently active gets annoying very fast.\n\nSometimes the music will randomly stop, leaving the game in total silence for a few minutes. This makes the half-hearted hidden object images even less fun. There's no real logic to the sizing or naming of some items, making it quite confusing and hard to recognize certain things. There have also been a few instances where I clicked a correct item but it did not register.\n\nWhile playing I stumbled upon a minor bug (if you use the tweezers under the completed trophy row it will "return" the map piece), but aside from that it worked well with no problems.\n\nThere's a lot of better hidden object games, so I really don't see a reason for anyone to pick this up.","January 3, 2015","false","5.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Even the titular crystal of time is wasted, it serves next to no role in the game.\nSpeaking of which… the gameplay mostly consists of running back and forth between half a dozen HO scenes to get your next key item, and after using said item you yet again search the entire house to find the one HO scene that opened up. Repeat a few dozen times until you win.

While its heart is in the right place, this game just doesn't live up to the standards set by other games in the genre...\n\nNavigation is a bit of a problem on some screens; it can be hard to tell which direction the arrows are pointing, and whether there is a new area to explore or not.  Speaking of navigation, I really hope you like backtracking.  The majority of this game involves running back and forth across the map to re-do hidden object puzzles you have already completed.  There is almost no way to tell what room you will have to backtrack to next, so do yourself a favour and just click the hint button.  It's better than wasting your time running around willy-nilly.  At least the game is kind and lets you instantly teleport to a handful of pre-selected screens from the map, mitigating some of the backtracking monotony.\n\nThe point and click puzzles were a little challenging, not because you couldn't figure out what needed to happen, but because some puzzles could realistically be solved in more than one way, and the "intended" solution didn't always match up with my adventure-gaming expectations.  (For example, did I really need to backtrack across the mansion to find a pair of tweezers when the small pliers that were already in my inventory would have easily gotten the job done?)  Combine this with the fact that some puzzles require you to be pixel-accurate, and it can be hard to tell whether you are doing the right thing and it's just not taking, or whether you need to use another item altogether.\n\nI also had an occasional problem with disappearing, reappearing puzzles.  First with the crane, and then at one point in the greenhouse, I completely lost the ability to interact with a puzzle, even though I had the right items in my inventory.  Each time I had to leave the area and come back later for the puzzle to reset itself.\n\nThe hidden-object sections were not bad, although they mostly followed the "we're going to put a bunch of things that don't belong together on shelves, and have half of them completely blend in with each other" style of puzzles.  For instance, having a paintbrush hidden inside the leg of a chair, or having a machete hidden along the trim of a cabinet.  For the most part, the items were easy enough to find, however a few of the puzzles were especially blurry and undelineated (I'm looking at you, hazy greenhouse).  The listed object names were fairly straightforward, and there were only two instances when I felt they needed a more clear word choice.\n\nAnother minor thing that bugged me was the fact that the "dust in sunlight" flavour animation looked remarkably close to the "puzzle here" animation, which was mildly confusing at first.\n\nThe ending, as I had been warned by several other reviewers, is a huge let-down.  For all the effort they put into the story, they should have written a more satisfying conclusion.  It just feels like it builds up to nothing.\n\nAs far as what the game did right:\n- They had a pretty decent musical score that fit the atmosphere well, and the voice acting was on point.\n- The story was compelling enough.  I liked the way it unfolded through scraps and clippings.\n- The art and backgrounds were quite well-drawn, on par with the most of the larger studios.\n- There were a variety of interesting locales on the map, and the use of time travel to enhance a few of the screens was a fairly novel surprise for this genre.\n- The mini-games were quick, fun little diversions that enhanced the otherwise repetitious gameplay.\n- The hint system is pretty good at giving you directions on where to go next.\n\nIf you are thorough and click on everything, use the hint system to minimize backtracking, and have decent hidden-object and adventuring skills, you will finish this game in one sitting with minimal trouble.  However, if you are looking for a challenging game, with intriguing puzzles that seamlessly blend the HOG and P&C genres... this game is not it.\n\nOverall rating: 4/10","October 25, 2014","false","4.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I'm perfectly fine with noting down that there's an unsolvable puzzle in a certain room and coming back to it... but I don't enjoy searching the entire mansion for a pair of tweezers (I don't even remember where I got them) when you would hope that the character would have one in her kit.","November 9, 2014","false","1.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It is not, however, an example I would recommend to anyone who doesn't regularly play those sorts of games, because it's a middling example of what these games can offer at best.\n\nThe story elements are pretty good, but the game fails in most other aspects. The seek and finds are tediously repetitive, the graphics are grainy and low resolution (adding to the tedious nature of the seek and finds) and the ending to the game is ultimately unsatisfying. There are also some language/translation issues, which can be problematic in the seek and finds. A few times an inaccurate term was used for an object (worm instead of caterpillar), and other times archaic and inaccurate terminology was used.\n\nThe journal entries were nice, and the quick travel map was a good idea, but I wish it were possible to zap to more locations with it.\n\nIf you regularly play these sorts of games, go ahead and pick this up, but you'll probably finish the game in an hour or two, so make sure you buy it at a price that makes the short length worthwhile. Everyone else, there are way better games in this genre I would recommend before this one.","January 30, 2015","false","2.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The music is decent, it fits rather well but there could be a larger spectrum of songs used overall.\nLastly the focus on story could be emphasised and perhaps add more comments on the stranger objects found by the character.\nAll in all I rate this game 7.5/10","May 25","true","1.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The hidden object scenes are done fairly well; but you'll see each scene 3 or 4 times throughout the course of the game.  The items you're searching for seem to randomly change; but you'll see repeats making things way easier.   The game also does a really poor job of providing hints or rationale for why you're revisiting areas to progress the story.  It's really typical to go from area to area to see if a new item or section has become interactive with no rhyme or reason for any of it.  This became really tedious so I started using the hint system just to find out which room I needed to go to next.   If they didn't repeat the hidden object scenes and reduced the amount of random backtracking it would have been a shorter game; but way better in the long run.","August 22, 2014","false","5.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Good choice if you have a spare hour or two and the game is on sale, otherwise you'll probably be dissapointed. The graphics are quite nice, music is also agreable, but the storyline is very simple and navigation in game has some weak points. There should be a recommendation option "I don't care" for games like this.\n\nPluses are just like in every other HO, nothing remarkable to point out.\nMinuses:\n- hidden object scenes use the same items several times and the quest items are not removed from HO the next time you get there,\n- few times you'll get frustrated becouse you have an object in the inventory that should be good for the task, but it just won't (ex. axe is just for roots, not for a tree)\n- there are no dialoges or animations, just written text\n- you'll probably get mad when seing "I should find the missing item first" for the hundreth time, as there is just this one phrase for every situation\n- there are very few and very easy puzzles in the game\n\nIf you are prepared to deal with those flaws, go ahead and buy the game, but if you are looking for an HO on Artifex Mundi level, don't waste your money.","March 13, 2015","true","2.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Based on that price this is a good game.  However, as compared to other HOGs I have played - and my wife is a fan of HOGS via Big Fish Games - so I have played dozens of them.\n\nThis one is just not fun.  There is something missing that I have not been able to identify yet.  It has some interesting elements, such as visiting the same location in the past, which has been done before but not often.  The location graphics are not bad, but as stated in some other reviews items are not always well defined.  I end up grabbing something from a scene without having a clue what it is/was.\n\nIn reality I purchased this game for the trading cards.  So if you enjoy trading and need more cards to feed that addiction, then for a $1, it is probably worth it.   Good luck.\n\nI am going to recommend the game based on the $1 price and the trading cards not the gameplay!","March 17, 2015","true","3.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/naogilles/recommended/306410/","naogilles","Nao 尚","http://steamcommunity.com/id/naogilles/","1700 products in account","This was my first hidden object game. Got it for free, so gave it a try, even though I'm not a big fan of Myst-like games (which I assume is what all HOGs are based on.)\n\nFrom what I could gather, the story is about a woman who visits an old mansion and decides to clean it up. The mansion's owner must have thought that women really liked cleaning up, because he regularly trashed the place again. Or maybe that's how hidden object games are supposed to behave, and don't ask too many questions.\n\nGraphics are beautiful. Some screens are only transitory and I'm surprised they spent time on them to begin with. Mini-games are okay, some are classics like the towers of Hanoi, some are interesting, others are too obscure but thankfully there's a Skip button, so casual gamers like me will never get stuck.\n\nThere's only one song in the game, and it plays in a loop. Normally this would be a major drawback to me, but the one song is good enough that it didn't hit on my nerves, and I actually liked having it in the background. (Edit: nope, there's more than one song, but they're all fine.)\n\nText is in broken English (like, they're trying hard but ultimately it's obvious it's not their native language, and I'm French so I would know), and the ending is as abrupt as an ending can be. Seriously, it's just three or four sentences, then "thanks for playing". That's a serious offender to me, but I guess the whole thing is about the journey, not the destination. Whatever. The complete lack of character interaction and dialogues is more problematic to me, you end up feely very lonely. Thankfully, if played in multiple short sessions, this isn't too much of an issue.\n\nI don't know how good a flagship this game is for HOGs, but I'm guessing it's not the worst. I personally enjoyed it, even though the time travel mechanic was really underused: there are like, 3 places in the entire game where you can travel in time, and it's only to find a less dirty version of that same room so you can play yet another hidden object scene.\n\nWill probably play another couple of HOGs in the future, perhaps better rated games, just to see if they're worth more of my time.","September 12, 2015","true","6.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

This game I powered through it just to get it over with. The game functions and at its core does the hidden object thing alright but everything else turned me off. Grab this one on sale or in a bundle if you're really curious.\n\nMy main issue was the back tracking and the game's complete lack of direction. Usually in these games I try very hard to avoid the hint button but unfortunately it's vital in this game because most of the time you're left with no idea where to go next. Then there is a huge sense of frustration when a lot of the time you're sent back tracking to a past area to get something you could have gotten before.\n\nIn terms of story, it's rather bland and horrible. You play a character who is a thief, this fact doesn't even factor into the story at all. Basically you're going to save your dad and what little story there is will be told via pieces of a journal you find. No voice acting either so enjoy reading this blandness! The name of the game is Crystals of Time but this barely factors into the game itself. Only three areas use the time travel aspect and one doesn't even count because by then it's the end of the game. Oh, and the ending is bland as well. "Thanks for the help!" is pretty much all you get.\n\nI could honestly go on about how much I dislike this game but that wouldn't be fair. It's still a hidden object game and despite my issues with it I played and enjoyed that basic fact about it. The artwork was nice, aside from the character models and the hidden object scenes and puzzles were well done. I just had issues with everything else which is why, in my personally opinion, I can't recommend this title. There are too many better ones on Steam.\n\nThis review is exclusively written for Y.A - Yolo Army, follow the group's curations here!","October 17, 2014","false","2.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

If you don't have the object you need for a puzzle, you'll need to check one of the two dozen or so rooms to see which one has had a hidden object puzzle suddenly pop up. I found myself using the hint button everytime I didn't know what to do, not because I was truly stumped, but because I didn't feel like searching every single room.\n\nWhen you get the item, you might not even know what to do with it. Maybe you missed the background object it interacted with or you forgot which room it went in or you just don't know what it does. Granted, this could be a problem in any HOG game, but it seems especially bad here. Unless I missed something, inventory items don't have descriptions. On top of that, went you find something that needs an item it just tell you, "I should find the missing item first." No allusion to what that might be. Sometimes it's obvious, but when it's not it's annoying. Again, not because it's challenging, but because it feels like lazy game design.\n\nA good HOG will kind of lead you down a path. Something will impede your progress, you'll solve it and move on. As you move on, older areas kind of get left behind, new puzzles are prominent, your mind makes connections between new items and the rooms you've been in. Here the game more or less just lays out a pile of screens and says, "Okay, figure out which of these seven locked doors need this key."\n\nOn top of these issues you have some really uninspired puzzles (a bunch of which amount to finding five similar objects  and bringing them to the same place), bland environments, over-recycling of HO screens and bad writing. There's a lot better HOG games out there. Don't settle for this one.","August 24, 2014","false","2.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

There doesn't seem to be any way of knowing in which direction you should go the more rooms and areas you unlock leaving your path extremely confusing and frustrating. Also there is a lot of things... not that that's necessarily a bad thing but it's an over-abundant amount of items to collect and hold for later or go back for at another time which is the bad part due to the many areas you need to go. Finally, all that might be okay but the Hint bar refills so super slowly and gives vague hints as to where you should go next. Some games, the hint bar only empties when you're in the area you need to be in and it shows you what to focus on, but even clicking it and being in the wrong area empties it leaving me confused still.

Reusing scenes is fine, but often the same items were reused over and over\n- Minigames were challenging ONLY because they were vague and the game instructions often wouldnt' load.\n- At one point after blowing through a wall, the art straight-up disappeared, leaving a blank screen to fumble through\n- rather than sectioning off areas (moving on from one larger area to another) the game had me going back and forth, back and forth through the ENTIRE map over and over and over again. No fast travel, either. The Back arrow was also flakey and you have to find the sweet spot to make it work, which made it that much more cumbersome.\n- No story to speak of, and what was there wasn't great.\n- HO scene sparkles weren't even animated\n- Hint button wouldn't point you in the right direction, but rather show an image of where you should go. This was mostly fine except for when it was somewhere you hadn't been before.\n- There wasn't really any sort of indication or explanation of the time feature - which you only use in two rooms + the ending.\n\nI could probably go on but you get the point.

I've played a LOT of them (thanks, Big Fish Games!). I like the puzzles, I like the hidden object scenes, and I'd say 99% of the ones I've played have at least some kind of reasonable story.\n\nThis game belongs in the 1%.\n\nPros:\n- reasonably nice graphics for an HOG\n- I can play in windowed mode\n- there's a map for quick-travel\n- nice soundtrack\n\nCons:\n- typos and painful grammar; reads like a bad translation\n- awful storyline, completely unbelievable premise\n- puzzles have nothing to do with the story\n- some puzzles are completely unintuitive\n- HO scenes randomly reset\n- jumping back and forth between locations in the hope that something new will appear\n- unrealistic, pointless puzzles\n- some items in HO scenes are named badly\n\nIn short, I can't really recommend this game. I wanted to; HOGs are generally fun, brain-candy games. I can usually finish one in a night. I'm halfway through this one, and I want to tear my eyes out. At this point, I'm only here for the trading cards -- and even those aren't dropping.\n\nNot recommended.\n\nUpdate: Having finished the games, I thought I might go back and play on Hard (so as to get my trading card drops).

It had a great atmosphere and the music is truly lovely - melancholic but modern.\n\nHowever, the game fast gets repetive, falling into the lazy traps that many hidden object games do.\n\nThe good points:\n\n1. The music, as  I've said before is lovely. It fits nicely with the atmosphere and although it's not that varied it doesn't prove distracting, it adds to the experience.\n\n2. Many of the mini puzzles are interesting and provide a bit of a challenge and variety.\n\n3. The first 30 mins or so of gameplay are excellent, the diary gives you hints as to what you need to do and you don't mind skipping between locations to complete tasks/find objects.\n\nThe bad points:\n\n1. In order to solve many 'puzzles' you need to collect objects to complete an item. Often these objects are hidden in completely non-sensical locations meaning that you have to trawl through all the possible locations of hidden object scenes. This could be so much better if you thought 'Ah, I need a pipe, I think I'll try the storeroom' rather than 'Ah, I need something to fix this damn boat and the diary is giving me no clue, I'll try every location until I happen to stumble across the correct hidden object scene - one of the master bedrooms'.\n\n2. In order to fix these 'puzzles' as I've said above, you have no real clue what you need to collect - there are no prompts - and so this undermines the puzzle element and just makes it a grind.\n\n3. The diary soon becomes of no use whatsoever. The 'clues' you pick up don't really help and there are no prompts.\n\n4. It feels very much like the game had a great germ of an idea but then didn't have the time to finish it.\n\nOverall a disappointing experience.","October 4, 2015","false","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Reusing scenes is fine, but often the same items were reused over and over\n- Minigames were challenging ONLY because they were vague and the game instructions often wouldnt' load.\n- At one point after blowing through a wall, the art straight-up disappeared, leaving a blank screen to fumble through\n- rather than sectioning off areas (moving on from one larger area to another) the game had me going back and forth, back and forth through the ENTIRE map over and over and over again. No fast travel, either. The Back arrow was also flakey and you have to find the sweet spot to make it work, which made it that much more cumbersome.\n- No story to speak of, and what was there wasn't great.\n- HO scene sparkles weren't even animated\n- Hint button wouldn't point you in the right direction, but rather show an image of where you should go. This was mostly fine except for when it was somewhere you hadn't been before.\n- There wasn't really any sort of indication or explanation of the time feature - which you only use in two rooms + the ending.\n\nI could probably go on but you get the point. This game inspired me to write my first ever steam review. The end.","November 16, 2015","false","26.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Had no end of trouble with the chain/rope in the garden.\n\nAs to the ending. It didn't feel like a payoff for a job well done. It felt like a pat on the back and a boot out the door.\n\nOverall cannot recommend this game as the map navigation is painful, the objects are annoying to work out, the hints are lackluster and the ending has no real payoff.","November 21, 2015","false","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Would not get for $5.\n\nCons:\n- Forgettable Story, I forgot why I was in the mansion or why am I doing what I'm doing in the game.\n- You find stupid collectables to get more stupid collectibles and it gets old.\n- There're "I Spy" mini-games when you have to find 12 items hidden within so many junk. This would be okay, but out of the 12 items you've found you can only take ONE with you. It gets worse, you do that SO MANY TIMES IN THE SAME AREAS!\n- The same one song on loop for the whole game.\n- I couldn't bring myself to finish the game.\n\nPros:\n- You get hints. Even though this helps the game go by faster, it was still too boring to finish.\n- Artwork was pretty good.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nDon't get the game, just play ' I Spy' and listen to some internet radio.","November 21, 2015","false","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is one of the ones I would recommend skipping completely.\n\nIt's nothing special and it's more annoying than it is pleasureable. The UI has minor annoyances that become greater as the game passes. There are no reasons given for why you have to back track to find other puzzles. Your intentions aren't clear pretty much ever. The time travel aspect is under-utilized and when it is it doesn't make any real sense as to why you it would really matter. These games usually only rely on the hint button when you are stuck on that last stupid thing to find in a puzzle or if you've lost track of things. Here it's the only way you don't waste 10 minutes each and every step backtracking through the entire map.\n\nSpeaking of the map, the in-game map is almost not worth it. There are only a handful of points available to teleport to and I don't know what is lazier - The lack of nodes on the map or my need to teleport to ♥♥♥-ends of each area instead of clicking through. I vote the map coding is lazier.\n\nThis is one of the worse games of this type I've played. My playtime is skewed because I had a clicker game open at the same time, but I played the whole way through and only finished because once I got past the "run as administrator" issue in the beginning I was determined to finish the game in one sitting nonetheless.\n\nThere are many better ones out there. Skip this one.","January 17","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Because I didn't like it. The soundtrack is bad and it will accompany you through the entire game, and you have a lot of backtrack to make. The game doesn't seem too original, and the story is almost non-existent.\nYou'll need to also use your hints a lot, because most of the solutions are pretty weird, not making any sense.\nBut, well, I'm not used to this kind of game, doesn't know if its a problem of this game or this kind of game at all.\n\nThe mystery is pretty good at first, you find a house and it is pretty dark and stuff, but later it just becomes pretty meh and you'll get used to it.","March 9","false","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story was made very simple and straightforward, making explorations to be the most thing you'll do in this game. Because of it, don't be surprised because there will be no cutscenes in this game. The intro and ending are all using text conversation.\n\nAlthough there are some puzzle in this game, the numbers are scarce compared to the Hidden Object games in this game, making the genre "Hidden Object" to be very accurate. However, i have to admit that most of the Hidden Object games are unlocked at unpredictable times and places, which makes me not knowing that it's already been unlocked. Because of that, i either have to exploring all places or clicking the hint button whenever i'm stuck.\n\nNote that because there are a lot of Hidden Object games in this game, you might get tired doing it so you might want to take a break when you are playing it.\n\nStoryAs i said before, the story in this game is very straight forward. The story was made as minimal as possible, although it's still retaining the most important part. The story progression flows smoothly, although the ending is quite dissapointing because of the minimalism. The ending is somehow like telling you "Hey, this game is ending. Bye.", and it just.. send you back to the main screen.\n\nGraphicsThe graphics in this game are on par with similar games (ex: Artifex Mundi titles), and i don't really have any complaints with that. The walkable paths are clear enough, and the hidden objects are blending perfectly with the background.\n\nSoundsTo be honest, the sound doesn't bad nor great. The bgms are relaxing. However, it can be quickly forgotten.\n\nHidden ObjectsThere are a lot of Hidden Object mini games in this game. One scene can be used for like 3 hidden object games. If you don't really like Hidden Object games that much, you'll mostly just random clicking everything, hoping that you'll find something listed there, or clicking the skip button, as there is no achievements both in game and in steam to 100% with.\n\nMost of the items are hidden well; some items even have almost the same color with the background. Some are placed in the foreground, and some in the background. You'll probably have been thinking to click that hint button even once, and clicked it.\n\nPros:\n- Tons of Hidden Object games\n\nCons:\n- Crappy ending\n\nConclusionIt's a Hidden Object heaven. There are tons of Hidden Objects to spend your time with.\n\nShould you buy this game?Yes.\nThat's if you like Hidden Objects. Because of the length, i suggest you to buy it when it's sale (when i write this review, it's on 80% sale, which is very cheap for games like this).","June 5","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
