Of course it blocked the whole road and you were out of nitro so in the end you were only able to score the infamously annoying 2nd place...\n\nWell 'Gas Guzzlers' solves this problem by adding some machine guns, shotguns or some friggin rockets to your car. An opponent is right in front of your car and blocks the way? Here it's a perfect opportunity to pump some metal into this target on wheels and turn it into a burning pile of scrap. EAT THIS!\n\nIt's definitley a very entertaining and quite solid arcade/action-racer with several fictional cars, routes and weapons, that features many interesting gaming modes as well as a small tuning system and... Zombies (DLC)! I mean hunting zombies with a nice sports car and some built in shotguns: That's the real manly way to do it!\n\nSure the cars don't drive very smoothly, there is no real story in the campaign mode, the music is just some generic rock stuff, there is no splitscreen (and the multiplayer is kind of empty) and the whole concept is copied from several other games but it is combined quite well, makes a lot of fun and is at least worth to look at in a Sale. It's like the indie child of 'FlatOut', 'Mario Kart' and 'Twisted Metal'. The one with Zombies. And rockets. And railguns. The one you always wanted because of...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eggtooth/recommended/243800/","eggtooth","Eggtooth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eggtooth/","687 products in account",""Very nische racing type of game, yet entartaining as nothing else."\n\nThere has been not many games that actually have cars and weapons mixed together. This type of racing game is pretty "nische" and there were games in the past (Road Wars for example) that did it nicely. This one is new, fresh, and does it stand up to the great game name?\n\nThat question is pretty tough, but in my honest opinion - yes it does. Previous Gas Guzzlers was plagued by loads of problems: from barely working controls, via terrible physics, to horrible optimisation. This one as sequel on the other hand, does everything better, as expected.\n\nGame starts you with sponsored car. You get the money by winning races. The more races you win, the more money you get. Also winning unlocks cars, upgrades, rims, stickers and weapons, but this happens every 3-4 races. There is a lot to do in single player, however, the beginning of the campaign is pretty slow, and boring, but it does get better as you progress more. In the race you have various objectives that can give you more money, like "destroy x amount of cars in 1 lap". This adds variety to the gameplay and does add the replay value to the game.\n\nGraphics are much better. They are shiny (but it's not overdone) colourful, with nice shadows and particle effects. Models look nice, and most of cars are based on their real counterparts which is good, but they have really cheesy names. Overall game has really cheesy humour, which could be considered childish, but for me, it doesn't matter, but let's get back to technical stuff. Damage done to cars is somewhat 'meh' but it does job well on harder difficulties. Ai does it's job too. They're challenging, they are intelligent and they use their weapons with caution and can be deadly sometimes. Optimisation here is also better than previous one. I have mid-range PC and 60FPS all the time on ultra settings, which is amazing. There are many options to customise so you won't be dissapointed. Sound departament delivers funny yet very high quality sounds, for example there are voice-overs from Duke Nukem (!) which is a nice touch (they sound exactly like duke!), engines have that "punch" and differ from car to car... Just awesome. Music is outstanding, some heavy metal tunes over there, but opinions may vary here.\n\nControls are improved, as it should be done in sequel. Car instantly responds to your commands, they have feel of weight, but at the same time they handle well. I had no problems handling the cars. Keep in mind that every car handles differently, and there are noticable differencies between all of them. Same goes to weapons. Some can shoot even backwards, which is awesome. There are some powerups on map such as repair, oil that you can spill on the track, mines etc. It all works together very well.\n\nMultiplayer is a typical madness. Capture the Flag, Deathmatch, Last Man Standing. Just Awesome. Too bad that nobody plays this game on MP which is shame because it's so much fun even with bots. Runs fluid smooth, has no lag issues, so what's the matter?\n\nThere are some flaws. Sometimes Ai runs in circles when FPS goes down on older PC's. There were some problems for me with my steering wheel, but I got them resolved, and mentioned above slow single player campaign start which is annoying and can make you bored of game quickly if you won't get new car soon. I also wish for more cars, and weapons. There were some problems with achievements, but other than that, I had no glitches.\n\nGame is good for what it is. It does entertain you, and it does it pretty well. Question is, is it worth 22,99? For me, yes, for others looking for a realistic racing game - not really. Buckle up, this is going to be hell of a ride!\n\n8/10","November 25, 2013","true","13.7"," 105 of 129 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","105","129","0","1"

The rash of Twisted Metal clones that came in the early days soured many, and even Sweet Tooth and the gang haven’t had the best track record as of late. Last generation, Burnout took up the car chaos crown, with its traffic checking and Crash Mode, but the developers got lost in Paradise City and are now toiling away at the endless barrage of samey Need For Speed titles. Gas Guzzlers Extreme, a new entry in the genre by Gamepires, isn’t going to set the world on fire, mostly due to its lack of flamethrowers. However, the game does strike a nice balance between the crash heavy races of Burnout and the heat seeking missiles of Twisted Metal that any fan of the genre should take notice of.\n\nI wrote more about it in my full review, available over on Geekenstein.com: http://www.geekenstein.com/gas-guzzlers-extreme-review/","November 10, 2013","true","2.4"," 70 of 87 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","70","87","0","0"

Futuristic hovercraft blowing each other up was made legendary in the Wipeout series and psychotic characters driving contemporary vehicles made blowing your friends up a blast in Twisted Metal. Gas Guzzlers Extreme is a good, old-fashioned vehicular combat racer which brings nothing new to the table but adds a new title to a solid and entertaining genre.The realistic thing about Gas Guzzlers Extreme is that you play as a redneck who has been recruited to race in a tournament created by rednecks for rednecks and, let’s face it, if anyone would be dumb enough to strap weapons on their cars and race around shooting at each other it would be rednecks.For fans of games like Flatout the amount of vehicles may be a bit small but coupled with a number of engine and weapon upgrades and the ability to customise the look of the car, there is ample opportunity to make the eighteen vehicles on stock completely your own. Cosmetic upgrades are free of charge and completing races will unlock new stickers and rims for your car. Engine, brake, and weapon upgrades, however, cost money which you earn during the race by finishing in a top spot, destroying enemy cars, performing daredevil stunts, and completing bonus objectives.Scattered throughout the tracks are weapons and boosts waiting to be picked up by the first car to hit them.The weapons available range from machine guns and shotguns to plutonium tipped rockets and some can fire both forward and backwards.As you can see, there is nothing really new about it, but the levels are very well designed and they come in seven different settings, ranging from dry deserts to snow covered mountains. None of the tracks I raced on was irritatingly complicated or idiotically simple, so the design team deserves complements for hitting a nice middle route in that regard. Races are tight and exciting and the AI functions very much like you would expect a real racer to behave.The graphics are adequate and the sound design is good but where the experience truly excels is music. The rock tracks that play during races blend perfectly into the action and boost the already heart-pounding excitement of the race.The game’s sense of humour is also a nice touch and everything from the track and bot names to the driver dancing the hula with a tire while you customise your car in the garage put a smile on your face both during and between races.This game is a welcome addition to the combat racing genre and although it adds nothing new to it, it holds up well against games like Twisted Metal. This genre is severely under-served on the PC and I encourage anyone who enjoyed the likes of Interstate ‘76 to pick this game up.","December 21, 2014","true","33.0"," 62 of 76 people (82%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","82","62","76","10","1"

The game features a single player campaign spanning over three separate championships and a multitude of races leading up to unlocking said championships, in which you can pick and choose which type of race you'd like to play. You have your classic race with no weapons other than specials (mines, smoke, oil spills, and the like), battle races (where you must complete so many laps and stay alive while trying to kill your opponents), and knock out races (number of laps equals number of opponents, and you can either win by killing everyone else or completing the laps remaining). Over time, you'll unlock some fantastic game modes such as deathmatch (whoever kills 10 other cars first wins), capture the flag (my personal favorite, where you must capture a flag and drive it to the other flag, which in many cases is picked up by the opposing team; death and explosions ensue),and last man standing (eight cars spawn on the map, kill and try not to die until you're the last). You can pick and choose from whichever game modes you want to play, earning points to further your standing. If you find classic races boring, you don't have to play them at all (other than one per championship), which is a pretty cool feature.\n\nThe cars control great, and differentiate a bit between one another. You have options to upgrade your car's body, weapons, and paint job, even down to what color your license plate is. There are quite a bit of cars to pick from, and many unlock during your journey through the campaign. The cars are not licensed, but are made to appear like real branded cars (the car The Matador, for example, shares the likeness of the Lamborghini Aventador). The settings screen allows you a variety of options, including turning cursing off, which I did simply because I liked having the option (this also would make this game suitable for children, as other than the cursing, there is no blood or graphic violence other than explosions, which are fun for the whole family).\n\nI beat the game's entire campaign in about nine hours, but it doesn't have to end there if you don't want it to. The game also features multiplayer for those who like to play online (not my cup of tea, personally, so I did not check this option out), quick races, and you can even continue in the campaign like normal, sans championships. For those who only play single player like myself, don't fret. The game's AI is some of the best AI I've ever seen in a game of any genre, and I'm not exaggerating. The AI in this will not let you win easily, and their ruthlessness in battle is what made capture the flag so fun and memorable for me. I did not notice any rubberbanding, however. The AI will mess up like you do, driving over mines and crashing into each other, keeping the game fair, yet challenging.\n\nThe game doesn't feature a very memorable soundtrack, but it's not terrible by any means, and the music that plays during upgrading sessions reminded me a lot of Fallout 3. The graphics of the game are pretty great for 2013, other than some blurry background textures that you shouldn't be paying attention to anyway. The only two negatives I have for this game are that for one thing, I never did figure out how to use the smoke special every single time I picked it up. It seemed finicky, like it would only work a third of the time you legitimately picked it up, so I'm not sure if it had a cooldown or what. The second negative would be that although you can pick between multiple game modes throughout the campaign, the race tracks seem to randomize, and you often have to play some of the same tracks quite often, despite unlocking new ones nearly every race. Also, if you are wanting to play a certain game mode but don't want to play on the track it offers, you can't switch the track within that game mode. You'd either have to suck it up or play a different mode (the latter of which I usually did, since they all are fantastic).\n\nGas Guzzlers Extreme is a fantastic game that should belong to every racing fan, and it serves as a great "learning tool" for those gamers who are looking for a good intro game to the car combat genre, as its options and various difficulties make the game approachable for genre veterans and beginners alike. It's one of those games you'll keep on your hard drive even after you beat it, because it's an easy game to drop in and drop out of. I would personally rate this a 9/10. I was looking for a car combat game that would make my heart race and fulfill my need for destruction and explosions, and Gas Guzzlers Extreme did so in every regard.","September 17, 2015","true","9.3"," 35 of 39 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","35","39","0","4"

In addition to the kick ♥♥♥ soundtrack, the cars are beefy in an arcadey way, the tracks are fun and often challenging, and the guns....oh man the guns!\n\nSo, there are a few different race modes (all the racing standards really), but in addition to all the standards, there is also deathmatch. DEATHMATCH! That is balls out crazy bad assedness! There is also capture the flag (which is pretty much deathmatch with an obvious objective added).\n\nThe campaign mode (so far as I have gotten) involves moving up through the rankings while buying new cars, upgrades, weapons and of course tricking out your cars as well. Each race features three modes to choose from (typically standard race, battle (with guns), and elimination). It's as simple as that.\n\nYou can select a cheeseball voice for your racer and s/he comments throughout. I chose Arnold, and get some laughs out of it.\n\nSo, in addition to the guns (THE GUNS!!!!), there are also pickups such as smoke, oil, mines, etc....flapjacks happen to be one of them lol...that you can then drop to mess up the other drivers. There is also nitro for that extra boost. You obviously have a myriad of ways to destroy your fellow racers, not the least of which include good old fashioned ramming. You can also pick up buffs like shields and double damage along the way. All are obviously single use or timed (depending on the type of pick up).\n\nMultiplayer features all the modes in a seven race round robin of sorts. They are team oriented, and if you play with somebody you know, you can definitely incorporate tactics into the matches to increase your odds of winning. There weren't a ton of players online when I played last night, but it was still a ton of fun and the game populates the matches with bots to fill them out if you don't have all 8 players to fill a server. The bots are actually pretty solid players as well lol.\n\nI would say this may go down as my fave racer. It is intuitive and easy to grasp, but still rewards practice. It has fun tracks, cool guns and upgrades, and no small amount of humor involved (outside of the voices, you might have a blow up doll or president bust passenger in your car, you might find penguins on the track, etc....).\n\nDefinitely must own, must play.\n\nDo Eet.

If you play singleplayer and need a challenge, by choosing from 4 different difficulties, you will be challenged.\n7. If you have a group of friends to play this game with, multiplayer is just awesome, you can lose a lot of time to it.\n8. Optimization. There are plenty of graphics settings if you are struggling to reach your desired FPS.\n\nCons:\n1. Multiplayer: As this game didn't have a lot of marketing and its developed by a really small team in Croatia, its not very known. Because of that, it is difficult to find others to play it with. I've been lucky and found a group of Americans.\n2. No splitscreen. As there are not so many players online, it would be nice to have splitscreen. I was sad as I could not play it with my friend when he came over to my house.\n\nI would recommend this game if you are looking for some combat on wheels.

The higher tier has more tracks but the game seem to have 4 environment only. Every race you win gets you cash to buy or upgrade your car, there isn't much ginding in the game since the money win per race is sufficient for you to buy multiple cars and upgrade them. Every race in the game has additional objective for you to complete, completing them will grant you extra cash. Objective such as: Kill Stu Pitt by smashing or be the first in every lap or get most kills in the race and etc.\n\nThe career is filled with 3 game type at the start, power race which is like normal races with no weapons (is boring), battle race which let you use guns (great fun!) and there is knockout race where the last racer gets eliminated every lap or you can blow up your oppenent to get them out of the race (this is pretty challenging). Later in the game has last man standing which is like a demolition derby from FlatOut but with guns! There is a death match mode as well in tier 3 where the first person to score 10 kills wins the match. In both Last Man Standing and Deathmatch mode, the player start with no weapon but they always have a random weapon for you to pick up in front of you. You can pick multiple weapons and swap between them in this game modes. After a few wins in a row, you'll be given a sponsor livery for you to put on your car, having the livery installed on your car will grant you additional cash and when there is a sponsor event you'll be invited to race in it. I only went through 1 sponsor event (I prefer the custom livery than the sponsor livery but it seems like you need sponsor livery to unlock sponsor event), it is a team race. It is simple, keep your team in front and stop/blow up your enemy when they try to take your team's lead. The other event I saw is a team death match, there is a total of 3 teams in the match and the first team to get 30 kills wins the match. Sponsor events brings a lot more cash than the usual races.\n\nFor the career mode, there isn't a fixed career structure. You can play the entire tier until the tournament unlocked by playing power race only if you want, the game dont force you to race a specific race mode that you may dislike, the only time it forces you to play through a specific race mode is in the tournament, you have to play each mode once. You progress the game career by climbing a leaderboard, the tournament is unlocked once you reach the first position of the leaderboard, the game dont force you to enter the tournament either, you can continue earning money for your upgrades even after you unlock the tournament. The AIs in the game is challenging, they are fast and it is definitely better than the typical NFS games AI, there are about 6 difficulty setting in the game.\n\nThe tracks are great, large wide tracks with a lot of room to run and dodge the bullets and there are some which are tighter and more twisty tracks which is much more challenging. The cars drives pretty well, not the best driving physic since all the cars feels the same but it is still fun. The weapons variety is great, it ranges from shotguns, machine gun, mini gun, rocket launcher, grenade launcher, gauss rifle and homing missles.\n\nI'll recommend anyone to this game if they are looking for a great arcade combat racer.","January 1, 2014","true","27.7"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

This game is also not split screen which is it's biggest down fall.\n\nI've read somewhere that this game could be comparable to an xbox 360 version of Mario Kart. Can such a comparison be made? Sort of. The game does deliver a fun arcade impact but instead of over stepping its boundaries and becoming limitless, Gaz Guzzlers Extreme simply plays it safe.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the fact that there is multiplayer is nice however there is NOT split screen (... seriously... get on the split screen thing for PC already people). The gameplay controls are what would one expect from a crash into everything type of game. The impact system is rewarding and when knocking out a player with a good nitro boost kamikaze, apparently you get more points. There are weapons that can be attached to the vehicles but this is where the game starts limiting itself. Playing career mode I've gone through four different types of weapons (one being a shotgun may I add and a second being a shot gun able to shoot forward and backwards). This is where it sort of sucks because I feel a lot more (maybe such as adding mortars etc...) could have been added. There are oil slicks as well as smoke clouds that are added into the game but serve more as defensive measures than offensive. This saved a bit of grace with the game giving it a little more to do. Career mode is fun and unlocking new cars slowly becomes rewarding. My favorite part to this game though is being able to choose different sort of races while moving on with your career. There are races where you can put weapons aside and make it a bump only race. This is a high light to this particular racing game, and sadly one of the only things to allow the player to step outside of the box. Career mode also offers players sort of side bonus races where the sponsor will have you play capture the flag. The variation in races is nice, and the tournament feature is a neat bonus.\n\nIf you want to run the game at 64x... do it because changing graphics within the game sometimes leads to a crash. None the less my computer goes nuts when running this game but the graphics do look good. The car selection is decent and the weapon selection and effects could have been better.\n\nSounds are as good as any vroom vroom sound.\n\nThis game is cool and has it's moments, but I don't see much replayability in the future either than a game of multiplayer once in a blue moon. If it added split scren this game could have got a +1 easily, followed by another +1 for having a multitude of weapons. But falling short with an appropriate rating of :\n\n7.1/10\n\nScreenShots :\nWhat it looks like being shot at\n\nI absolutely love when games pay attention to detail. Nice to see the back of the car\n\nSmoke screen about to clear up. They are quite effective in this game\n\nMoment of impact","February 24, 2015","true","3.0"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","5"

Car combat games, I mean. The best we got was the Twisted Metal Remake on the Playstation 3 in 2012, and that was after years of silence in that genre. Back on the Playstation 1, the best Twisted Metal competitor was undoubtedly Vigilante 8, and Gas Guzzlers reminds me of that game quite a bit, though it focuses more on actual racing than Twisted Metal or Vigilante 8 did.\n\nThe game is also quite beautiful, with gorgeous lighting, cinematic motion blur, and highly detailed tracks.\n\nMy issue with the game is the progression. The demo was great fun, because you had a pretty good car and a varied list of modes to play through, between arena deathmatch, combat racing, and even capture the flag. The progression in the full game is a lot more tedious; you have to work your way up buying new cars one by one, but you are locked out of the good cars until you reach a specific point in the game. It always felt like I had more than enough money for whatever I wanted at any given time and that the game was intentionally holding me back and restricting me to lame cars.\n\nYou are also very slowly eased in to the game's more intense modes. Expect to spend a couple hours doing slow races, often without any weapons at all. Eventually you'll end up with a garage full of cars you'll probably never drive because they are objectively worse than stuff you get later on in the game.\n\nDespite this, I'd still recommend it. There's a great game in here, you just have to do some digging to get to it.","January 20, 2014","true","13.8"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","1"

It's kinda fun for a while, you can't play too much at once, just few races because its too repetitive. There are few types of races like with or without guns, knockout (every round the last one is destroyed) which seemed as the most entertaining for me and deathmatch or last man standing mode. From time to time there are sponsored events and championships. For every race you will get some money in order to improve your car or buy a new one. Possibilites of car improvements are very limited and there is a long way to unlock them, the only visible modifications on your car are paint, stickers and rims. Long story short the money in this game isn't an obstacle, it is just too repetitive and it takes just too long to unlock all the cars, improvements and tracks. Multiplayer is an another chapter.

At first I considered giving a detailed point by point, but this title just isn't worth my time.  Not worth it to play, not worth it to go in depth.  I'll skim the surface.\n\nGas Guzzlers Extreme is what it is, a brainless party racer with boring/unrewarding controls, poor track layouts, and a consistently tasteless sense of humor bashing users over the head at every turn.  It's a game where gently nudging somebody off the track is far more effective than pounding them for half a lap with automatic weaponry.  More frustrating than fun.\n\nThat said, the game does look pretty good, has a decent number of race modes, and the career progression seems pretty well put together.  Even though it's got those premium ingredients, Gas Guzzlers Extreme is let down when they come together and provides a below-average experience overall.  I can picture the game having an audience--everything does.  For some, there is surely fun to be had here, but it isn't for me, and I wouldn't recommend it.","December 13, 2014","false","1.3"," 40 of 73 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","40","73","0","0"

As a lover of Rogue Trip on PS1 I have been hunting for a game like this for some time. I went through a couple indie games before I got to this one and it's exactly what I was looking for: Cars with guns.\n\nThe career mode reminds me of Need For Speed Underground 2 in many ways... but with guns. It does take some getting used tot and the default key bindings are rubbish, however once you're up and going and shooting and racing it's a really great game. I love that is has a plethora of ahievments to unlock that actually feel meaningful to get (similar to Counter Strike: Global Offensive). The graphics really are top notch. If you don't have the specs to play this game at max settings you're really missing out on some great stuff.\n\nIt's challenging and rewarding as a PvP race game. I don't like the Power Race mode (cars WITHOUT guns, boring eh?) and I'm not a massive fan of the Deathmatch/Last Man Standing/Capture The Flag modes either. They are fun to play around in but the lack of a minimap of any description is just killer, it's like playing a FPS game without a radar. It's fun, but it's not as fun as the races.\n\nHaven't done a lot of multiplayer just because there aren't really many people playing it as far as I can tell. One thing I like aobut the career mode is that you progress, you upgrade and unlock, you have to think about where and when to spend your money (not that there's a real shortage of it), and that isn't present in multiplayer. All cars are the same and all upgrades are unlocked, which is fun in a sandbox mode kind of way but it is much more satisfying to have earned those things yourself.\n\nWould love if I knew some more people playing the game because I think there's a lot of great things to explore and experiment with. No regrets buying the game at all and will certainly continue to play it.","April 26, 2014","true","13.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

Kind of a Vigilante 8 and Burnout meet Dirt Showdown. Looks great and plays solid.\nGood assortment of game modes and thankfully a decent enough to work singleplayer campaign.\nFrom standard racing to full blown vehicular CTF warfare.\n\nI only have 2 problems with it.\n\nIt locks up my desktop when I exit it forcing me to sign out of my windows account and back in as the Game screen sits frozen on top of everything including taskmanager.\n\nAnd secondly every time I go to play online there is nobody playing forcing me to play against AI.\nHonestly quite surprised this game doesn't have loads more playing it. Definitely has a AAA polish to it.\nIf they could get more people playing online this game could easily consume hours of my life.\nTime for some PR work from the devs me thinks. This game could easily become a name franchise like Flatout and Burnout.\n\nOnly thing I'd add to the game is having some kind of progression and levelling unlocks so you could upgrade and buy vehicles like in the offline career mode instead of having everything available from the get go.\n\nBut yes, if you like shooting cars with cars while racing in realistic looking environments then this game is definitely worth checking out especially if it's on sale.\n\n","September 8, 2014","true","20.7"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","2"

The end result feels somewhat like an R-rated version of MarioKart. Its fairly straightforward once you learn the what the few powerup symbols do. You earn money from races and then maintain a garage with multiple cars with a moderate amount of upgrades. I mean, its not like a Gran Turismo level of upgrades, but they all work and make things feel faster/more responsive/more powerful.\n\nWhile I definately recommend this game - the caveat is that you get it on a sale, which happens almost weekly it seems. I'd never pay the full asking price because of this.\n\nPros:\n+This game is really fun when played in relatively short bursts.\n+Graphics are pretty nice considering it doesn't take too much to run it.\n+Cars handle pretty well. Everything feels good.\n+Lots of options all around: great selection of cars, customization options, weapons and upgrades. There is certainly enough meat on the bone here.\n+I haven't even gotten to multiplayer yet, but there is alot to be had with this.\n+From what I see there are four race 'types' - basically a spectrum that ranges from 'pure race' to 'arena battler'.\n\nCons:\n-Generic heavy metal/rock music is generic.\n-Being an arcade racer, it is fairly simple for those of you that want more complexities associated with simulators.\n\nTotally fun for the (nearly weekly) discounted price.","December 29, 2015","true","1.6"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

Turning left and right is really realistic and it may be hard to drive for the first few races but once you get the hang of it you will be a real guzzler maniac!\n\nMaps are briliantly made, I was stunned by the enviroment while I was driving and how every road feels different. On dirt it's really hard to steer and break but on concrete it's the opposite and you can go really fast while still having control over your vehicle.\n\nThere are a lot of game modes which remind me of FPS games like "Capture The Flag" and "Team Deathmatch" and they are really fun because the weapons in this game are f*cking awesome! Once you destroy a car it blows into 5 million pieces and every piece is very detailed (they even look amazing on low settings that I play on)\n\n\nThis was written in 6am while I was struggling to keep my eyes open, I will most likely update it every once in a while since I really enjoy the game and it was developed by people from my country which makes me even more interested in it because gaming and video games in general aren't really popular in Croatia so I want to see how popular it will get.","December 31, 2015","true","11.2"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

What total nonsense. They claimed that playing death matches or capture the flag would make the game more fun. I played both (specifically where I said "Multiplayer games against bots") and they were still not fun.\n\nEdit 2: I've checked the steam page for Gas Guzzlers and there's not one negative review with over 50% of people who found it useful.Huge redflag.

Getting a kill in a race is incredibly satisfying, mostly because when someone dies in a race they are COMPLETELY out of the race. If you can ram them hard enough, you can even kill opponents in races that don't have guns, and there's even an achievement for it. Sadly, the weapon classes are limited to shotguns, miniguns, and rocket launchers. The good news is that there is some good variety within each weapon class. There's plenty of vehicles available, including a Reliant Robin and a DeLorean, and all vehicles can be upgraded (however, some vehicles can be upgraded further than others). The vehicles seem to just scale though, and it's more a case of 'what's better' instead of 'what would work best for me', which is a bit dissapointing. You can also choose from 4 sets of voiceovers for your driver, 3 of which that are silly, and 1 that is just Duke Nukem (possibly unlicensed, but I don't care). The sponsor system is cool; you can only have one sponsor at once, you only get bonus money from your sponsor if you have the sponsor's decal equipped, and sponsors might abandon you if your performance gets sloppy. Sponsors will also invite you to special sponsor team events where you are given a car and a weapon, and you are put on a team led by your sponsor with the objective of defeating a team led by a rival sponsor, with a sizable cash payout if your team wins. Standard career events are randomly generated based on what tracks and gamemodes you have unlocked, with optional secondary objectives that offer bonus cash if you complete them. The game's humor is good, and it's crude, but not completely tasteless, with subtle refrences in all sorts of places.\n\nThis game made me realise that Full Auto 2 would have been more than just mediocre if it was more like Flatout 2.\nIt's a good thing FA2 and FO2 got drunk at a party and woke up next to each other without pants.","March 16, 2014","true","6.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You loved Carmageddon. You always liked the concept of cars with weapons.\nPut that in a blender and you get this brillant game, Gas Guzzlers Extreme.\n\nFirst of all, holy crap what a lot of game modes and possibilities in one rather unknown game. Customizable cars (even in multiplayer!), a hell lot of tracks and maps and go on.\nNow the game can have this all and fail. But it does not. This is action filled racing and killing. The controls are really arcade; most like you should expect of such a game. It still is hard to get proper control; you have to defend yourself against other drivers, while attacking them and still racing.\n\nNow what does your car have beside well... being a car?\nYou'll be fitted with two sorts of weapons. First of all, one type of gun will be fitted on the car. You may choose it depending on the game mode, and you can't change this in the race. You can only pick up extra ammo for it.\nSecond there are special weapons you can pick up during the race, a bit like in Blur. Think in mines, spilling oil, smoke and extra boost.\nTalking about boost; your car has it. It is earned through various ways, as in these pick ups, and well not driving so clean; hitting other cars, powerslides, destroying stuff that is in your way and more.\n\nThe graphics are just good. Nothing extraordinary, but neither is it ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Same for the AI.\n\nThe game itself is one of the most perfect racing multiplayer games in its sorts. It really is one of the most fun games to play along with others. A bit like Mario Kart really; the misery of others is what makes it fun.\nSo, without a doubt recommended.","January 12, 2014","true","8.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Getting a kill in a race is incredibly satisfying, mostly because when someone dies in a race they are COMPLETELY out of the race. If you can ram them hard enough, you can even kill opponents in races that don't have guns, and there's even an achievement for it. Sadly, the weapon classes are limited to shotguns, miniguns, and rocket launchers. The good news is that there is some good variety within each weapon class. There's plenty of vehicles available, including a Reliant Robin and a DeLorean, and all vehicles can be upgraded (however, some vehicles can be upgraded further than others). The vehicles seem to just scale though, and it's more a case of 'what's better' instead of 'what would work best for me', which is a bit dissapointing. You can also choose from 4 sets of voiceovers for your driver, 3 of which that are silly, and 1 that is just Duke Nukem (possibly unlicensed, but I don't care). The sponsor system is cool; you can only have one sponsor at once, you only get bonus money from your sponsor if you have the sponsor's decal equipped, and sponsors might abandon you if your performance gets sloppy. Sponsors will also invite you to special sponsor team events where you are given a car and a weapon, and you are put on a team led by your sponsor with the objective of defeating a team led by a rival sponsor, with a sizable cash payout if your team wins. Standard career events are randomly generated based on what tracks and gamemodes you have unlocked, with optional secondary objectives that offer bonus cash if you complete them. The game's humor is good, and it's crude, but not completely tasteless, with subtle refrences in all sorts of places.\n\nThis game made me realise that Full Auto 2 would have been more than just mediocre if it was more like Flatout 2.\nIt's a good thing FA2 and FO2 got drunk at a party and woke up next to each other without pants.","March 16, 2014","true","6.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It has replaced Grand Tourismo 3 A-spec as my favorite racing game, and that was a game that I got 100% gold on all races and tests.    The controls of GGE are sublime.  At first a seasoned racer might think the controls are a little simple, and that the simulation is not realistic, but this completely falls by the wayside as the game increases in complexity and speed.   When you start getting the faster cars, and onto the harder tracks, the game assumes an incredible speed, and you begin to be amazed and start thinking things like "did I really just pull that off?!"   All in all, this game sets the standard for a Car Wars road racing video game.   There is no other game better.  The game also as an incredible amount of songs.  The game is light hearted and all the cars, upgrades, race tracks and gameplay are whacky jokes.   For example a M3 BMW is a "Bummer 3M"  And a Shelby GT500 is a "Lord Shaggy 500 JT"    Recently I've tried some other racing games, and frankly the "learning curve" on the controls has been tedious and annoying.   I put that in quotes because I know how to drive a car fast, and I've been playing racing games for a long long time.  A game should be good enough that you're not fighting against the controls.   GGE delivers, the controls are sublime.","October 20, 2014","true","22.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

You race in different events to collect money to buy/upgrade cars. As you move up the rankings you can compete in a tournament. After successfully completing the tournament you can move up to a higher tier with faster cars.\n\n+ Lots of different game modes, classic , deathmatch, capture the flag etc. Each one is fun to play and offers something unique.\n\n+ Tons of weapons in 4 categories: Machineguns, shotguns, rocket launcher and grenade launchers. Each weapon has its own strengths and weaknesses\n\n+ Lots of well designed race tracks and arenas\n\n+ lots of options to customize each race. Two options stand out for me; Arcade mode means your car does not loose traction depending on what surface it's on, and rubberbanding can be adjusted in the multiplayer for AI bots you can race against.\n\n+ Dedicated servers so you can play multiplayer against bots and thus earn some of the multiplayer achievements\n\n+ developers have supported this game long after release and continue to be active on the forums.\n\n+ The DLC zombie mode is a fun, frantic horde mode against zombies.\n\n\nThe Average:\n\nThe soundtrack is not memorable but it does get the job done.\n\nThere are still some people playing on the servers but it would be nice to see a lot more.\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis is a fantastic arcade racer that should be played by more people. The developers have done an amazing job with this game. I considered this a 'hidden gem' within the Steam catalogue. If you love arcade racers, check this game out.\n","March 13","true","13.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It has replaced Grand Tourismo 3 A-spec as my favorite racing game, and that was a game that I got 100% gold on all races and tests.    The controls of GGE are sublime.  At first a seasoned racer might think the controls are a little simple, and that the simulation is not realistic, but this completely falls by the wayside as the game increases in complexity and speed.   When you start getting the faster cars, and onto the harder tracks, the game assumes an incredible speed, and you begin to be amazed and start thinking things like "did I really just pull that off?!"   All in all, this game sets the standard for a Car Wars road racing video game.   There is no other game better.  The game also as an incredible amount of songs.  The game is light hearted and all the cars, upgrades, race tracks and gameplay are whacky jokes.   For example a M3 BMW is a "Bummer 3M"  And a Shelby GT500 is a "Lord Shaggy 500 JT"    Recently I've tried some other racing games, and frankly the "learning curve" on the controls has been tedious and annoying.   I put that in quotes because I know how to drive a car fast, and I've been playing racing games for a long long time.  A game should be good enough that you're not fighting against the controls.   GGE delivers, the controls are sublime.","October 20, 2014","true","22.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It's surprising how my view on this changes when you add guns and utter destruction.\n\n\nOh, this game. I found it in some weird bundle and tried it with little to zero interest... man was I wrong.\n\nGameplay-wise, GGE is a fast paced racing-shooter-multievent game. You  take part in tournaments where you need to complete races in various modes (ranging from "normal" race to arena/CTF), earning money and unlocking cars, upgrades and new game modes in the process.\nI love a lot of things about this game, from the general "I don't fing care" humorous kind of style to the music. Some texts/voices are hilarious, as are the first cars you race with. Graphics are also quite good and I like a lot how damage is dinamically represented on the cars.\n\nIt gets a bit repetitive after a while, but it's good for a half an hour of brainless distraction (and destruction) once in a while. It also has  multiplayer but I haven't tried it yet, although I fear the servers are a bit empty because this game is unluckily not as known as it should.\n\nI don't know if it's worth getting at full price (here it is €23+5 for the DLC) but if it is on sale buy it without hesitation!","January 4, 2015","true","11.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

You race in different events to collect money to buy/upgrade cars. As you move up the rankings you can compete in a tournament. After successfully completing the tournament you can move up to a higher tier with faster cars.\n\n+ Lots of different game modes, classic , deathmatch, capture the flag etc. Each one is fun to play and offers something unique.\n\n+ Tons of weapons in 4 categories: Machineguns, shotguns, rocket launcher and grenade launchers. Each weapon has its own strengths and weaknesses\n\n+ Lots of well designed race tracks and arenas\n\n+ lots of options to customize each race. Two options stand out for me; Arcade mode means your car does not loose traction depending on what surface it's on, and rubberbanding can be adjusted in the multiplayer for AI bots you can race against.\n\n+ Dedicated servers so you can play multiplayer against bots and thus earn some of the multiplayer achievements\n\n+ developers have supported this game long after release and continue to be active on the forums.\n\n+ The DLC zombie mode is a fun, frantic horde mode against zombies.\n\n\nThe Average:\n\nThe soundtrack is not memorable but it does get the job done.\n\nThere are still some people playing on the servers but it would be nice to see a lot more.\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis is a fantastic arcade racer that should be played by more people. The developers have done an amazing job with this game. I considered this a 'hidden gem' within the Steam catalogue. If you love arcade racers, check this game out.\n","March 13","true","13.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

If you enjoy these types of games--everything from Blur to Wipeout--then give this game a try (there's a free demo). This is about as good as this genre gets.\n\nPros: Weapons: There are a variety of weapons to choose from and most have a tremendous feeling of heft/firepower.\nExplosions: When you blow up an opponent, the resulting explosion is extremely satisfying.\nTracks: A nice variety of tracks that feature plenty of shortcuts and alternate routes.\nDifficulty: There are several difficulty levels. The game can be as easy or hardcore as you want it.\nDemo available: The demo is great for trying out the gameplay and playing with the graphics settings to make sure the game runs well on your system.\nCons:\nHumor: It's a mixed bag. It's a bit on the immature/borderline offensive side of things. Some of it was funny, but it sometimes crossed the line of good taste (IMO). Thankfully, you can turn off the voiceovers, which is the primary source of the questionable humor.\nThe one thing I won't comment on is the graphics. That's because my system actually comes up a little short of the minimum specs. While the game is technically playable on "medium" graphics on my system, I prefer to play it on "low" for silkier gameplay. Admittedly, it doesn't look that great. But it plays great. That's good enough for me.\n\nOn a system closer to the recommended specs, I bet it looks great. Again, download the demo, play with the graphics settings, and see for yourself.\n\nBottom line: It's a great arcade combat racing game. Get it if you're a fan of the genre.","December 7, 2014","true","36.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Had to lower the graphics quality even further (which it had been on Medium preset before, now its on Low preset) and set the resolution from 1280x720 to 1024x768.  Thus I give the customer service an A+.\n\nI ran through one race after these changes were made, the AI actually appeared to be a bit more competent; they are actually trying to complete laps now.  I still wound up passing them by, but thats not a bad thing; means the AI is not built for rubber band physics, which in turn means the game is fair.\n\nSo would I recommend this game? Yes, I'd probably give it around a 7 or 7.5 out of 10.  Where as before I would of probably given it a 5 or 5.5 when it was bugging out.\n\nSo give it a shot, its a decent racing game.\nIf you have any issues with the AI and controls, try fiddling with the graphics and resolution settings a bit.","December 14, 2014","true","1.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/killerfrosti/recommended/243800/","killerfrosti","Pepsiman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/killerfrosti/","606 products in account","NOTE: to the people who don't like to read, there will be a short summary at the bottem of this revieuw.\n\nThis game is awesome. Basicly it's a racing game with weapons and powerups combined with a strange kind of humor that if you can apreciate that kind of humor will make you like the game that much more. I've played the game for about 4 hours now and I think i've seen enough to write a revieuw about it. If I'll encounter more awesome stuff in this game I'll change the revieuw.\n\nThe game starts off pretty awesome, You create a profile and get to choose a protagonist for your driver. You get to choose between 2 voices no-one cares about, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Duke Nukem. Of course Arnold and the voice actor of Duke Nukem didn't record these lines but I know who voiced Duke Nukem and I'm familiar with his Duke voice, and although the guy sounds like Duke there's a clear difference between him and Duke's voice, but the develloper went the extra mile and made him really sound like Duke Nukem and that's something I have to give them credit for. I don't know how acurate Schwarzenegger's voice is as I'm not as familiar with his voice as with Duke's voice but it does sound like Schwarzenegger.\n\nAfter you created your profile you're good to go. You start off with a little bit of cash so you can buy your first car, put some guns on your car and you're off to your first race. At the start there are 3 game modes you get to choose from: Power Race, Battle Race and Knockout Race. Power Race is a race without weapons but with powerups like mines, oil slicks, smoke trails nitro's and repair pickups. Battle Race is a race with powerups and weapons. Those weapons are attached to your roof and can be used to shoot the living hell out of your opponents with weapons like machine guns, shotguns and rocketlaunchers and some of those can even shoot in 2 directions so no one is safe in front or behind your car. Oh, and cars donnot respawn so if you got destroyed it's race over. Knockout Race is basicly the same as Battle Race but this is more like an Elimination race as the last player that crosses the finish line gets eliminated and that goes on till there's only one car left. There's also Last Man Standing after completing the first tournament, which is basicly a battle in an arena that ends when only one car is left.\n\nNow you might be wondering what the goal of the game is. For as far as I know it's winning all the tournaments. To get to a certain tournament you have to race untill you scored enough points to take on the tournament, you'll get points for winning races and killing opponents. Than you can participate in the tournament to compete for the most points which will be rewarded for winning and killing opponents. after you won the tournament you'll get some money and a new car. It isn't the most origonal idea but it works fine.\n\nAnother big part of the game is it's humor. Not all of you can apreciate it but it doesn't affect the gameplay if you don't enjoy it but it makes the game that much better if you do. from wheird opponent names like Sum Dum Guy, Kent U. Seemee and Lui Bricant to sponsors with names like Happy Smoke that fill your car with pictures of weed if they sponsor you. I personaly enjoyed this kind of humor. Talking about sponsors, sponsorship is a big deal in this game. They will give you extra money if you win races and you'll unlock special sponsor events that reward you with a lot of cash if you win. Sponsor events are mostly team based games like Capture The Flag and Team Deathmatch. You can get a sponsorship by winning a few races in a row. If you do well they'll pay you more money but if you end up on a losing streak they will stop sponsoring you.\n\nI also want to mention something about the music in this game. The music in the main menu and during the races isn't anything special, but it isn't bad either. it pretty much concists of generic metal tunes that will get you in the mood but nothing memorable. The music in the garage however concists of things like country, jazz and I even heard the Dutch and American national anthems, it just adds to the fun factor of this game.\n\nThe only downsides to this game are the ability to restart races during a tournament which alows you to try the smae race over and over again untill you win and the amounth of racing tracks. There aren't that many which can make the game repetitive. I didn't think it was a big deal because I had a blast playing this game no matter what track I was playing and it is 3 times cheeper than most tripple A titles but keep that in mind if you want to buy it. Also the game is pretty easy on it's default difficulty setting as you will barely lose a race so sponsors keep bringing in more money and you'll become too rich. I don't say this to critisize the game it's just to tell you that if you want a chalange you should crank up the difficulty. You can also change the difficulty later on so you don't have to do that while creating your character.\n\nLong story short it's an amazing game. If you want to play a Racing game as Duke Nukem or Arnold Schwarzenegger with  more action than just driving around in circles then this is the game for you, races are fun and the gameplay mechanics work very well. The only downsides are te ability to restart tournament races and the amounth of racing tracks but that can easily be justified by the game's relatively low price tag. Therefor I give this game an 8/10","February 23, 2015","true","9.8"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","8","13","0","0"

This is like all those old fps car games like vigilant 8 and so on, mashed together with some mariocart-ish power-ups. Throw in some bad and sleazy comments, and i'm sold.

Played next car game: wreckfest, was dissapointed. Played the new Carmageddon and it is fun, but was missing something. Turns out that what Carmageddon was missing was nice visuals, better control of cars and lastly ... shotguns and rocket launchers.\n\nThe different modes offer a bit of replayability. If you just want to straight up race in super cars, you can. If you want to blow stuff up with a grenade launcher in a reliant robin, you can. The zombies DLC adds another reason to buy this aswell. Waves of zombies, cars, guns and power ups. great stuff.\n","June 15, 2015","true","16.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Gas Guzzlers delivers.\n\nFans of cars and explosions will have a blast zooming around the game's large selection of tracks across a variety of environments, including deserts, snowy mountaintops, tarmac tracks, and backwoods trails.\n\nThere's a good selection of cars and even more weapons to equip them with, as well lots of other unlockable goodies to upgrade and decorate your cars. The solo campaign is great, but beginner racers might find it slightly difficult. The AI racers also all have really stupid (and frankly immature) names too, but that's not really a huge deal I guess.\n\nControls are responsive, and gameplay is tight and rewarding; there's something satisfying about blasting away your fellow racers, or forcing them to crash into things. You may also find it's reminiscent of kart racers like Mario Kart and Diddy Kong racing as you dash around collecting powerups, repairs, and cash bonuses.\n\nThere's also a wealth of multiplayer modes, so you can choose your flavour and start blowing up your friends however you like.\n\nI highly recommend this one, can't get enough of it.","October 19, 2013","true","20.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/indigojam/recommended/243800/","indigojam","IndigoJam","http://steamcommunity.com/id/indigojam/","160 products in account","This game has tracks that are blatent remakes of some from A LOT of different popular racing games from the past (Trust Me it's a GOOD thing, some are based on REAL world racing tracks though, so I guess technically those aren't ripoffs), then they add variations, mirrored mode (confuses the heck out'a My dyslexic azz), racing modes with no weapons, with JUST the drop types (Mines/oil-slicks/smoke-screen), and with full on weapons! (The racing is like this nasty, yummy, mix of (depending on the mode) NFS Underground2 (EZ drifting to gain NO2), Midnightclub Street-racing (the full on weapons racing), Spyhunter (the OLD retro game, in the mode with just drop weapons racing), Twisted metal (the Deathmatch modes), Vigilante-8 (also the DM, & CTF, team modes), Burnout (the fragging other racers by hitting your boost then ramming them), Grid/Gran Tourismo (the REAL racing tracks), Dirt (the AWESOME rally tracks).\n\nThis all come in a pacage with AWESOME graphics, smooth controls, VERY scaleable options so this game will run on ANY PC with enough tweeking (for weak PCs try the pixal scale % option out). Controls great with a KB (I've heard), and great with a controller. Even with most'a the graphics turned down to run this game on My laptop, it STILL looks easily as good as say Fuel, or NFS World.\n\nOnline is where this game is BY FAR the best overall car game going right now, there's servers (dedicated run by the company) ALL over the world, so you can find one where your ping will be a low #, there's servers for different skilled drivers, servers that are race only, deathmatch only, CTF/DM only, and some that are a mix of them. All of the servers I've been on had voting turned on, you can join an empty server, vote to change the options the way you want (Add/remove bots 1 at a time, bot difficulty (6 levels), team/single mode [yes you can race in team mode ☺], team stickers, respawn options for battle, track/map, Friendly fire, I'm sure I'm forgetting some, but this game has it all!\n\n***EDIT*** The online is FULL of cheating little Brazilians from a clan they call "FUN", that were also the kids who beta tested this game, they cuss people out, know every single stupid trick, & will even use hack-tools on you like lag SPAM, if you DO manage to beat them, they have not only done this to Me (under more then one name, so they didn't always know it was Me)... BUT they did it to no less then 7 some odd other players who responded to My Steam forum post complaining about these kids behavior... buyer beware, if you plan on playing this online, plan on getting griefed by trolls***\n\nThis is the racing equal to Serious Sam 3BFE, more options then you can shake a stick at, lagfree online play, drop in/out so no waiting for others to play, everything you could POSSIBLY ask for. So far as I know there's no region blocks ect. so everybody worldwide can play, I've played on some of the EU, and Russian servers with almost no lag on My cheap/slow DSL.\n\nThe single player is neat too, has lots of difficulty settings for everybody to enjoy the game, has upgrades, mods to put on your cars, ect. Oh online everything is opened already, just go setup your online profile (car, main weapon, vinyl, paint, rims/color, ect.) before you hit refresh to scan the servers. Don't be discouraged if nobody is online, people always come, & you can levelup your online profile VS bots of any difficulty you chose.

The level design is very good forcing you to make strategic choices on weapon and powerups while ripping up the various game modes including Cups and Championships which are won by competing in Power-up Races, Weapon Races, Knockout Races, Massive Deathmatch Arenas. Each event has bonuses for doing specific things like finishing 1st every lap, Killing a specific player with a specific weapon or style, dropping Smoke or Oil on a number of opponents, etc, etc.\n\nMy little gripe is with the controls, or more to the point, having to set a button for change weapon as the default button didn't seem to work. After I set a button for changing weapons things improved in Deatmatch events :-)\n\nI would advise anyone thinking about getting it to give the Demo a few races, that's what I did and quickly realised I wanted more.\n\nThe Graphics, Sound, Physics and Handling are all AAA title good.","January 2, 2014","true","32.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sponsers are a great addition. The cars and tracks are very well detailed and the AI is very tough without feeling cheap. Multiplayer is nice however the game comes with enough content to keep most people happy. I also liked the music and sounds. The game tracks do get a lot better the more you get into the game. Snow, hot air ballons and more. The tracks are very well done.\n\nI really like this game. A lot of the cars are name brand cars you will know right away however they are all called something different in game. The more I play this game the more I like it. Its not perfect but its darn close. I still feel like as great as this game is. I think its missing something and I can not put my finger on what. However that aside its still one solid racer and if your a racing fan and want to blow up other cars this is the game for you.\n\nThe game does come with many modes, one is no weapons for the purist of hearts however the only way to go up in ranks is to do the tournaments and they do require hurting other cars.

This game has multiple modes that allow players to options to choose from weaponless racing, weoponized racing, or straight up deathmatch car combat. The wacky named cars and drivers, deep voiced announcer, and cheesy dialogue all pay excellent homage to classic car combat games of the past such as Twisted Metal and Carmageddon. There are lots of vechicles to choose from and many ways to customize your vehicle with choosing between various mounted guns, paint jobs, and rims that anyone who enjoys making their game avatar their own will very much enjoy the features. Although Gas Guzzlers Extreme sufferes from some weapon balancing issues, predictable A.I., and a lack of an on screen radar, I found the game to be one of the best examples of a modern car combat game and a great appeal to old fans of Twisted Metal and Carmageddon.","April 22, 2015","true","5.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It pretty much looked like the game I remembered, but with decent graphics.\nSo, I kinda had to buy it and I enjoyed it a lot so far =)\nIt could use a few more weapons, but to be honest, I couldn't think of anything really missing. The basic weapon roles are filled (machine gun, shotgun, rocket launcher).\n\nI'd like to mention one more little thing, because it's something I haven't seen in a while: If you kill a car in a race, it actually is out of the race. It's not reset after a short delay or any of those shenanigans, you can enjoy watching it burn where you shot it lap after lap =)\nAnd you can win a race early simply by wrecking all opponents.\nSo, I guess my point is: It's more a shooter with you sitting in a car than a racing game with the occasional shooting.\n\nCar handling is decent and enjoyable, but obviously not realistic in any way or form.\n\nI'd give it a 8/10, highly recommended if you want to shoot a driver if he dares to drive ahead of you.","April 26, 2015","true","2.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

The names and some of the wording of things is a bit Meta, but entertaining. It's one of those racing games I enjoy because they're not all cutting edge and technically bloated like San Francisco Rush. If I have a complaint it's that the tiers for unlocking cars is spastic. I unlocked the first 6 cars in the first 2 hours and haven't unlocked anything since. Seriously, I haven't unlocked any new cars in the last 3 days and I the number of times I haven't come in first (And by that I mean second) You could count on one hand of a lousy shop teacher. I thought there was something I was missing. I slowed down just to kill the other cars to get bonuses, even cranked the difficulty. Nothing. I looked it up and everyone else says 'Just keep grinding and you'll start unlocking cars again'. I'm at 181 points. (Number two in the game is at like 50).

Shooting on the run can prove a little bit challenging at times, but there are enough options to be satisfied depending on the way you like it. If you're more of the ramming type, go for a shotgun. If you'd rather play it safe and focus on driving and shooting accurately, go for a machine gun or a rocket launcher.\n\nGame looks fine, and the graphical options are wide enough to make the game run on toasters.\n\n... this is the best thing ever!","June 9, 2015","true","14.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

While inferior aesthetically to say, Jak X, Gas Guzzlers is mechanically sound, possessing solid controls, easy to use weapons and a diverse range of cars. The physics engine in particular is well-implemented, avoiding the sense of weightless sliding about you get from games like Twisted Metal, nor the drunken careening into obstacles of Grand Theft Auto- unless you run over an oil slick, of course. It’s very easy to ♥♥♥♥ up driving controls and in a driving game, thus ruining the entire experience for everybody involved. Not so here. However, in other areas, Gas Guzzlers feels very much like the budget game it is. The music is ignorable at best and there is absolutely no semblance of plot, though there is amusing flavor text for each of the weapons and looks-real-but-has-a-fake-name cars. The campaign is structured like every other driving game ever, wherein you play a series of one-off races to rise through a leaderboard to the top, then becoming eligible to enter a tournament and advance to the next tier- three total. in this game’s case. You may receive a sponsorship and then gain additional funs from each win, and there are periodic exhibition events that force you to use a particular car and play a particular gametype but have large payouts. You unlock additional cars, tracks, parts, weapons and cosmetic customizations as you progress, most of which must then be purchased. There’s a fairly diverse range of tracks and arenas, and even gametypes featuring hordes of zombies in the multiplayer, if you have the “Full Metal Zombie” DLC. I was disappointed that no zombies appear in the campaign. However, barring tournaments and sponsored events, you may choose what type of event to play, allowing you to focus on a race type you are good at or enjoy over others. Also of note is the ability to select a voice pack for your driver, including a reasonable facsimile of Duke Nukem, though even his one-liners will eventually wear a bit thin. I must note that none of Gas Guzzler’s flaws is in its gameplay. If you like games that have cars with guns on them (and to my distress, many people apparently don’t) you will enjoy Gas Guzzlers. If you don’t… then why are you reading about one?","August 25, 2015","true","8.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jtarlton/recommended/243800/","jtarlton","jt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jtarlton/","1410 products in account","Gas Guzzlers is a great destruction racing game. Gameplay is your standard racing-with-guns experience, though I haven't seen a game like this with limited ammo before. You'll need to pick up ammo on the track if you run out. Opponents are generally beatable, but they occasionally seem to get unreasonable bursts of speed. Let me break it down:\n\nGOOD:\nBattle racing\nDecent physics\nEnjoyable player investment system (Car and customization unlocks are well paced and worthwhile)\nSense of humor (You can have Duke Nukem sound clips as your driver voice, the car names are all satirical, you get points for chicken squishing, etc.)\nGraphics look great\nController Support\nAnnouncer (Yells "DOUBLE KILL" etc. during races)\n\nEXTRA BONUS POINTS:\nReliant Robin ripoff car\n\nBAD:\nPoor optimization (I have to turn everything all the way down to get a decent framerate at 1280 x 720. FFS I can run Assassin's Creed IV better than this.)\nAI sometimes feels cheaty\nInput lag (at least with a 360 controller, haven't tested anything else)\n\nAs a last aside this exact game (so far as I can tell) was on Desura about a year before it showed up on Steam, titled Gas Guzzlers: Combat Carnage. Desura refuses to give Steam keys claiming it's an entirely different game. This seems pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ to me, but I think the publisher changed since the original release, and most likely the new one didn't want to give out copies.\n\nGet this game if you like battle racing. Think VIgilante 8 or Full Auto. If it's your thing the $20 price tag isn't too much. On sale for under $10 I doubt you'll be dissatisfied even if you have only a passing interest.","July 21, 2014","true","1.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Especially ones that include weapons against your opponent. Hell, we haven't had great ones come to mind for years (Carmageddon, Diddy Kong Racing, etc). So what makes this one stand out?\n\nEverything. This game spoils you with some seriously cool graphics, gameplay, and humor right from the get-go.\n\n*WARNING - THIS IS NOT A DRIVING SIMULATOR - TURN AWAY AND GET ASETTO CORSA OR WHATEVER IF YOU WANT THAT KIND OF GAME*\n\nWhat kind of cool graphics? Well, let's just say this game isn't going to run smoothly on your old 2009 PC. I'm fervently against graphics-over-gameplay gaming, but this is so beaufitul and the way it plays is so much fun that I can't wait to run it when I get my GeForce GTX 770 in (planning on running two of them, but I'm getting off-topic). So I guess I'm kinda griping and praising the game at the same time, with saying it's "necessarily beautiful" and if you don't have a PC that's capable of running it without horrible lag, it's going to affect your gameplay a TON (perhaps even unplayable).\n\nWhere do I begin about the gameplay? You drive a car, shoot opponents, win, get money. It's not that easy, though. There are different types of races available that you need to get to know to advance yourself in the "Career Mode". Tons of tracks. Tons of cars. Tons of weapons. Tons of playability when you mix and match all three. As I write this, I'm only 4 hours into the game, and I'm blown away. I picked this up for $10 on a sale, but I would be happy paying the $25 had I known about it's existence prior to clicking on the "Weeklong Deals" button.\n\nThe humor? It's all around. If you don't have a good sense of humor, well, you're just a stick in the mud and aren't going to have a good time with the game. Yeah, it's a little juvenile in some of it's humor, but that's what makes it great. Your opponents have names such as "Jack Kass, Luke Likesheet, and Alotta Fagina" (you giggled at at least one of those, didn't you? ;) *snicker*). Currently, I'm driving a car that's sponsored by Buttwesser. Yes, Buttwesser. Once more... Buttwesser.\n\n9.5/10 - This game is going to get a lot of playtime from me.\n\nP.S. - Haven't tried the multiplayer, but holy crap that would be awesome.","March 13, 2014","true","21.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I have not seen any of these. I'm surprised at how bug free this has been for me, the performance is great but that may just be my really expensive gaming PC, and as far as winning, the people saying it's impossible are just really bad at it. I almost win every race. Which, is probably the biggest thing I don't like when it comes to racing games. I play FlatOut, there is no challenge at all and I'm pretty much garunteed to overlap the AI every race. This? Well, it is more of a challenge. I pretty much never overlap anyone. Which is good. The AI are actually decent at driving, unlike a lot of other stuff. And the weapons make it even more fun and challenging! Overall, this game is good. I would suggest getting it if you enjoy racing, shooting, and derbying all mashed together.","February 27, 2015","true","26.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It makes no apologies for its ridiculousness and it doesn't need to. Fantastic at getting some actual adrenaline pumping and on the higher difficulties in the campaign it can provide an actual challenge. The races, which are the focus of the single player, are fun enough but are not the highlight of the game. The absolute highlight is the deathmatches, and capture the flag modes. Deathmatches make me amazingly nostalgic for my Twisted metal days and feel like the perfect blend of that old school gameplay with modern gaming tech. Capture the flag is a fun thing I haven't seen done in a car combat game before and actually works really well, the mad dash for the flag closest to you when the respawn is chaotic and the feeling of crashing into the opposing flag carrier, destroying them, and depositing your own flag is incredibly satisfying. A few shortcomings are the lack of clarity in how to advance in the campaign and the UI design could use some work, I found myself not being able to figure out what team I was on in a team game without bringing up the race stats on the overlay which I found a bit annoying. Additionally the Last Man Standing game mode, while very fun in multi, can be infuriating in single player considering when the difficulty advances enough the opposing AI develops the ability to know exactly where every repair powerup on the map is and as soon as you get them below half health in a fight they will turn and make a break for it. When there are multiple enemies remaining this isnt a problem as gun fire is coming from multiple directions and they usually cant make it however when it comes down to you and one CPU having to try and chase them down and finish them off before they can reach a repair powerup becomes nearly impossible and it can make the game drag on for an eternity. I had a few of them last for over 30 minutes before I decided to just give up on the mode in singleplayer entirely. Overall however this is the most surprisingly exciting I have ever found a game. I have put far more hours into it than I thought I would already and I'm just getting started.","December 11, 2013","true","14.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Not in a good way but I suppose that is the wheel's fault not the game's so stick to the keyboard or gamepad unless you have a good steering wheel. Anyway this game is like if Burnout 3 and Twisted Metal had a baby.  It has a certain sense of humor that takes me back to when I was little when butt jokes were funny and I really appreciate that. I normally don't really laugh at stuff like that but this game was able to make me laugh quite a bit. The graphics are stunning for an indie title and the controls are solid. It has a good original soundtrack that is very suiting to the play style and the weapons are very satisfying. You can even select an exaggerated Arnold Schwarzenegger or Duke Nukem as your driver's voice. That alone should make you want this. Come on, click that little add to cart button.  Now.

While inferior aesthetically to say, Jak X, Gas Guzzlers is mechanically sound, possessing solid controls, easy to use weapons and a diverse range of cars. The physics engine in particular is well-implemented, avoiding the sense of weightless sliding about you get from games like Twisted Metal, nor the drunken careening into obstacles of Grand Theft Auto- unless you run over an oil slick, of course. It’s very easy to ♥♥♥♥ up driving controls and in a driving game, thus ruining the entire experience for everybody involved. Not so here. However, in other areas, Gas Guzzlers feels very much like the budget game it is. The music is ignorable at best and there is absolutely no semblance of plot, though there is amusing flavor text for each of the weapons and looks-real-but-has-a-fake-name cars. The campaign is structured like every other driving game ever, wherein you play a series of one-off races to rise through a leaderboard to the top, then becoming eligible to enter a tournament and advance to the next tier- three total. in this game’s case. You may receive a sponsorship and then gain additional funs from each win, and there are periodic exhibition events that force you to use a particular car and play a particular gametype but have large payouts. You unlock additional cars, tracks, parts, weapons and cosmetic customizations as you progress, most of which must then be purchased. There’s a fairly diverse range of tracks and arenas, and even gametypes featuring hordes of zombies in the multiplayer, if you have the “Full Metal Zombie” DLC. I was disappointed that no zombies appear in the campaign. However, barring tournaments and sponsored events, you may choose what type of event to play, allowing you to focus on a race type you are good at or enjoy over others. Also of note is the ability to select a voice pack for your driver, including a reasonable facsimile of Duke Nukem, though even his one-liners will eventually wear a bit thin. I must note that none of Gas Guzzler’s flaws is in its gameplay. If you like games that have cars with guns on them (and to my distress, many people apparently don’t) you will enjoy Gas Guzzlers. If you don’t… then why are you reading about one?","August 25, 2015","true","8.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

But you can also ditch the race all together and do free for all team battles, including capture the flag. The free-roaming game modes gave me some flashbacks to the good old Twisted Metal days.

I'd rank it up there with DiRT Showdown, Flatout: Ultimate Carnage and other first rate arcade racers.\n\nThe graphics are great, it supports my Fanatec Porsche GT3 RSR v2 wheel and pedals, the humor is hilarious low brow and I even like the sound track music, which is a rare thing for me.\n\nI haven't had any problems, it runs fine with all the eye candy maxed out on my AMD 1090T 3.2 GHz 6-core, ATI Radeon R9 280X DC2 TOP, 16 GB DDR3 RAM machine.  Silky smooth framerates.\n\nThey've done a great job with this one and it definitely deserves some attention.  I spend most of my time with hardcore racing simulations, but now and then I like to leave off the realistic stuff and go crazy with a good arcade racer,  This one fills the bill nicely.\n\nHighly recommended.","November 2, 2015","true","5.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I got it on a whim when it was on sale, and I've gotta say I'm happy with what I payed. At the time of this writing I've only clocked in about two hours, but it was two hours of explosive combat driving with the right amount of humor to leave a smile on your face. This game isn't bogged down by some stupid plot to explain why everyone attached guns to their cars, and there's no slow-moving rpg elements as you build your cars. No, this game is just full-fledged arcade histaria as you blast your way through the pack of cars while Arnold Swartzeneger laughs and screams out cheesy movie quotes. It's a fast-paced game that gives you some challenge, even if it does rely on rubber-band physics. It'll keep you playing on the edge of your seat.

Do you like Racing? Go for a "Classic Race". Do you like slaughtering your enemies and do not care for racing at all? Go for "Deathmatch".\n\nThe Singleplayer takes about 10-15 hours to be played through and is fun (most of the time). If you fail to win a race - just buy a better car.

I actually kind of figured I'd bought a dud, but figured, whatever. Maybe it'll work some other time. Finally booted it up again, and it worked...\n\n... only for the Steam controller to not work.\n\nAlright, so the configs solve the problem, remapped to keyboard controls, a quick switch in the menu and viola, I can finally play my game!\n\nSo, despite a pretty rocky start, it's good. In fact, I'd go so far as to call it an unexpected gem. One of those real treats that I'm still getting from Steam, an impulse buy that is more than worth the money.\n\nA ton of unlocks, a variety of game modes with an admittedly slightly repetitive single player (start at the bottom of the ranking, race, destroy, smash your way to the top of the ranking, enter tourney, win three races rinse repeat), good soundtrack and a kind of frantic humor that otherwise would annoy me but blends seamlessly into the satisfying, visceral combat and conquest.\n\nAnd that's the crux of it, really: the joy of high-speed, eye-melting explosions while the faux-celebrity of your choice belts out complete insanity to the hectic crescendo of a shrieking minigun. Running through explosive barrels, crashing into other drivers, DESTROYING other cars, and generally crying blue havok refills the nitro tank and gives you a little speed boost. It's well designed, and when it works best it becomes a bloodthirty speedfreak cycle, like surfing on a wave of corpses.\n\nTo summarize: some rough edges, but a heart of gold. If you can look past small annoyances, there's a lot here to love. And, ultimately, it's fun. FUN. I'm looking forward to beating the absolute ♥♥♥♥ out of it.","February 21","true","8.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

It is a basic concept but works well enough to be fun and addictive. Some player may get bored with the basic concept but for those player who don't have much experience with car battle games. Then this will fill the void nicely. There is lots of upgrades, tracks & weapons to unlock as you progress through the career mode. There are three main features to customise your cars with, colour, sticker and rims. Getting through the career mode does take a bit of time and luck. It does not necessarily matter how good your are but it will help.\n\nControls of the cars feel realistic enough. They feel heavy and planted to the ground. The control input is very responsive.\n\nThe graphics are very good depending on the performance of your computer. There is an issue with frame rate dropping when in the middle of a pack of cars and going at high speed. I believes from other players that this issue does appear whatever graphic performance setup you have. So this maybe a terminal issue in the game. However the frame rate does not drop enough to spoil the game. It will take a little practice to adjust your judgement when this occurs.\n\nSound of the cars are realistic and make controlling them feel real. Firing the weapons sound good on release and impact. The sound track of the game I am really impressed with. It sets the mood of the game just right. I only play the soundtrack during the menus. Listening to the carnage in the game play sounds just as good and feels satisfying.\n\nHighly recommend this game.

I've not counted, but there's at least 20 or so vehicles in the game. You can customize each vehicle with skins, customized license plates, change the color of your rims, upgrade your parts and weapons, etc.\n\nThe controls work great, even with a keyboard, though I prefer using an Xbox 360 controller, which the game supports perfectly (just plug it in, launch the game, and you're good to go), The developers made the vehicles feel weighty, and it feels great when doing races. This could've easily been split into two different games, a car combat game and a straight racing game, and they'd both feel great to control.\n\nThere's a good selection of maps, which is always a huge plus for any car game. The graphics look really nice, too, every map and car looks nicely detailed. It isn't Gran Turismo levels of graphic fidelity, but for me the graphics in this game are perfectly fine.\n\nI highly recommend the game, I've had a blast with it so far, especially when playing with friends, and I'd also recommend the DLC. Both of them add a handful of extra tracks, the zombie DLC is incredibly fun, especially the Survival mode, and there's a few cars added as well from the DLC!","June 16, 2015","true","4.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Reminds me of the old Twisted Metal games for Playstation. It's a solid racing game but with tons of action, explosions, and even zombies. I was just going to play it for a little bit to kill some time, and I ended up getting hooked on it.\n\nThe positives are the gameplay, difficulty, and visuals. The game is exciting, with guns and explosions and a few jumps. Quite satisfying. The game can get very difficult on the higher difficulty settings, which provides a great challenge. The visuals are probably the strongest aspect of this game. Very gritty, but at the same time flashy and over-the-top. Overall, it's a very gratifying experience.\n\nThe downside is that there is pretty much no choice at all in terms of cars and equipment. Each new car is basically a complete upgrade of the previous car, so there's no strategy or preference at all. The best car is just the best car for everything. All upgrades can be bought, and there's no need to design anything. You just choose the best car with all upgrades, and that's the best. Would be nice to see slower heavy cars that are better for battle, or super fast cars that get wrecked easily.","October 15, 2015","true","27.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Don't have many hours in it yet but multi-player was fun, I haven't progressed enough in the campaign mode yet to see if that has much value.

You could compare it to Twisted Metal or Vigilante 8, but it's less story-driven, and there are no characters.

In singleplayer the AI intelligence level seems to vary from completely daft to T1000.\n\nIt's definitely a sleeper title that deserves more love.

Reminds me of the old Twisted Metal games for Playstation. It's a solid racing game but with tons of action, explosions, and even zombies. I was just going to play it for a little bit to kill some time, and I ended up getting hooked on it.\n\nThe positives are the gameplay, difficulty, and visuals. The game is exciting, with guns and explosions and a few jumps. Quite satisfying. The game can get very difficult on the higher difficulty settings, which provides a great challenge. The visuals are probably the strongest aspect of this game. Very gritty, but at the same time flashy and over-the-top. Overall, it's a very gratifying experience.\n\nThe downside is that there is pretty much no choice at all in terms of cars and equipment. Each new car is basically a complete upgrade of the previous car, so there's no strategy or preference at all. The best car is just the best car for everything. All upgrades can be bought, and there's no need to design anything. You just choose the best car with all upgrades, and that's the best. Would be nice to see slower heavy cars that are better for battle, or super fast cars that get wrecked easily.","October 15, 2015","true","27.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

My best choise is double-sided minigun, and there is no better weapon (sadly).\n4) I hate LAST MAN STANDING, because when there is only two players left the game can lasts forever.\n5) Stupid AI.\n\nAnyway, If there will be more racing tracks and better engine it would be really awesome game.\nI got my fun, I like this game, I haven't tried multiplayer yet, I think it's better then singleplayer.\nI hope this game will develop further.","December 26, 2013","true","9.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Nothing bad about that but no new wooov experience. Anywy back to this game, short story.  2 Words: Mad Max and Death Race on steroids :)\n\nDepending on what type of race you choose you will be able to upgrade parts such as engine, brakes, tires and more. And if not satisfied buy yourself a new unlocked car. And the cosmetic yup its here as well. Paint your car, put on bought stripes, paintbrush stickers and why not some new shiny rimes  ;) The car handling and physix is spot on in this game. Love it. The feeling when you accelrate feels down to your bones.\n\nCampaign: Choose your car and upgrade it with the money you have in the begining. (Dont worrie you will earn alot more as you progress and unlock more stuff.) After that you are being showed a screen where you can pick your favourite type of race. You will progress in a leaderboard up to the top. And you will unlock more cars, parts, stripes, wepons and more depending how you beat the maps placing 1st,2nd or 3rd place.\n\nIn campaign you will also get sponsor contracts where you can earn some big cash and drive their sponsored car. You can also unlock sponsor car skins wich will give you some extra cash if you use them and win any race.\n\nQuickrace: Here you can choose Car combat, Normal race, Destruction derby, Last man standing or why not zombie mode one hell of fun if you ask me. Take some friends with you for a game and you will have a blast. Iam getting this for my son thats for sure. Love it. (There are more gamemodes in the game, the above is an example.) One last thing quickrace is awesome for killing some time. In my case i have been playing quickrace destruction derby, defend base and survivor zombies for hours already. ;)\n\nMultiplayer: Is the same pure fun as singleplayer but with real people online ;)\n\nGfx 10-10 (The quality of textures, animations and physix's is midblowing)\nSFx 9-10 (Sfx and music is fitting the game perfectly)\nGameplay 10-10 (The car handling is one of the best i have experienced in the arcade genre)\n\nI have been trying to look for some flaws but couldnt find anything wrong with this game. My new gem in my collection for sure. I would recommend developer to have this game as free weekend, i can promise that most of all new players who didnt have a clue about this game will buy it. RECOMMENDED FOR SURE!\n\nPlease note! That zombie mode is bought as DLC and i would recommend buying all DLC.

The graphics are so stunning they actually caused my computer to overheat, yet I experienced no lag, frame skipping or input delays even on the highest graphical setting. The customization for both your car AND your driver are at a somewhat simple level that does not overwhelm the casual player but still allows for a nice level of individuality.

This is one of those games that is easy to pick up and hard to master; a game that I find myself thinking about in the middle of a work day or right before I fall asleep. I really admire games like that.","June 26, 2015","true","29.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The graphics are nice, the handling well done and a nice choice of tracks/arenas.\n\nIf your looking for single player campaign action this may well fall short of your expectation but if your about fast quick pick up n play multiplay, then a romp you will have.\n\nIt creeps into the thumbs up for me but not by much as while the multiplay makes this worth a buy, the normal price tag makes me wince when i weigh it up pound for pound.\n\n( While i wont change my original review or that of the DLCs because i do want people to consider the point im making before purchasing just the base game only, i dont want people to think this is a bad game as its most certainly not).","March 6","true","16.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's a nice throwback to games like Twisted Metal and Carmageddon. The humor is awesome. The upgrades are awesome. The music is awesome.\n\nBut...\n\nThe driving is extremely mediocre. The cars need to handle a bit more arcade-like for this kind of game. They feel heavy, the cars don't turn, and it takes weeks to get back up to speed when you hit something. Even standing on the nitro you rarely get a sense of speed.\n\nThe tracks need to be less annoying. I'm talking Nitro-ing through a straight and then of course there's a strategically placed pillar right as you enter the turn to stop you dead. This, and other "don't go fast" annoyances are far too common in this game. Who the hell wants to approach turns with caution in a game like this? I love more tactical games like Grid, but if I want that I'll go play Grid.\n\nThese annoyances really start to become glaring about 10 hours into the game when the difficulty ramps up. At some point it stops feeling like a smash-mouth racing battle and it starts necessitating too much deep thought, strategic pick-ups and conservative nitro-ing. In fact, not firing your weapons starts to feel like the better option in most cases, and how dumb is THAT??\n\nIt's very close to being a good game but these flaws keep it squarly in the garage.

Majority of the game was played in medium difficulty. tried Impossible but it REALLY was impossible.\n\n8.5/10 The game and race are good, my problem was the gameplay when racing and you are only allowed to use 1 weapon. There are only a few viable weapons in game from my perspective. I believe even AI's dont use the other weapons as well. AIs in Arena modes are predictable. Performace was GREAT played on both a 5 year old PC and a cheap laptop. Probably the first game i saw that used the "pixel quality"   The game is still fun. Played a few rounds in multiplayer. Better races if you can find other players.\n\nBonus point for having an active developer correcting my mistake\n\nNeeds improvement on AI as well.as the core gameplay with only using 1 weapon in battle races and last man standing hurts its replayability for me. AI can be improved but not really necessary for the mode i am having issues with.\n\nRare achievemnt Hunter:I somehow lost a game but got a IMPOSSIBLE difficulty badge even though I was the first to die. and the achievement requireme to kill ALL HAHAHA","June 24, 2015","true","15.5"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","4","9","2","3"

I wasn't expecting modes like TDM, CTF, etc... in a game like this, but it works. In race modes, there is another way to win - destroying everyone else, and it is fun. It takes a little bit time to get used to the game, because you are not only there to race, but also to fend for yourself.\n\nGraphics, sounds, music are all alright. You can choose to run the game in 64bit if you desire. Gamepad is fully supported. Car customization is not the best, as you mostly deal with internals, but it is sufficient. Just don't expect NFS Underground II levels of customization!\n\nSad to see there is little to no multiplayer action though. I guess it is due to the amount of time passed, and maybe as people consider this genre a niche for some reason. But I can only imagine this game being even more fun with real people, especially friends. But I still have fun playing the Campaign mode to be honest.\n\nAlso, when you crash someone, you get the middle finger. Overall, I recommend this game to anyone who are into "car battle" or racing games.

Lots of humor brought into the game, be it computer player names, or the included voice packs. (Hail to the King, Baby!) Also, why wouldn't you want a game that includes a Reliant Robin look-alike!\n\nIt's an amazing arcade racer, with the expected handling and control that you'd expect from such. Think Burnout Paradise, but now you have shotguns/miniguns/RPGs/grenade launchers/railguns/nukes to blast the competitors out of your way. Power-ups are scattered around the race tracks, and can definitely help you catch up if you're behind, or to keep the competition in the dust.\n\nWhile the game is a blast to play, it does quickly get repetitive, as there's only a dozen or less tracks for each mode, and that's not including when you drive the opposite direction. With exception of a few game modes, you're locked to your weapon of choice from your garage, or sponsor for the duration of the race, so make sure it fits your preferred style of destruction! In-game money does seem to be a very moot point, as you are rewarded with exuberant amounts (assuming you place first, and have the sponsor bonus cash), and upgrades honestly don't cost much, and only take a single race or two to be purchased. As for buying cars, by the time it's released to be purchased, you already have enough winnings to not even hesitate purchasing it, even with buying every upgrade for every vehicle as soon as it's available.\n\nGame modes include:\nClassic Race: No guns, no power-ups, but boost is included.\nPower Race: No guns, but you do have power-ups. Driving skill of the track, and power-ups are the key to winning.\nBattle Race: Same as above, only with your guns now.\nKnockout Race: Same as battle, only the last player of each lap is eliminated, and the race continues until only one person remains. Taking out opponents can quicken that final lap, as they do not respawn. Neither do you either.\nDeathmatch: Set in an open area, weapons are scattered around the playing field, and you can switch between the ones that you have collected during your current life. First to the set score wins.\nLast Man Standing: Same as above, only you don't respawn.\nCapture the Flag (Team): Also set in the same open arenas, there are two flags that need to be captured. Only one player from each team can take a flag, and in order to score, the flag holder needs to collect the second flag from the opposing team. First team to the set score wins.\nTeam Matches: Any of the above modes can have set teams, and the team that reaches the score, or highest ranking of the race wins.\n\nOwning the Full Metal Frenzy DLC, the two vehicles are just plain remodels of two existing cars, with the same stats, handling, and performance. Dominator, Demolition Derby, and Domination Derby are great modes, but that is all the DLC brings, as Zagreb is very small, and the flags spawn in 2 of 4 places and alternate back and forth, unlike other maps that have several spawn points. The Cowboy arena is also very hilly, and hard to get your sights set, as well as for this arena, the computers are more prone to running away and hiding, rather than trying to fight you, sometimes forcing the clock to run down, as they boost from health pickup to health pickup.\n\nAll in all, it's a great fresh game, with great influences, pushing it in all the right directions, and steering away from poor decisions of it's inspirations. Grab the demo, enjoy it, then purchase it! I do recommend buying it when it goes on sale, as $10 is a fair price for this game, not $25, especially with how minimal the DLC bring, and their high price for what they include.","March 8, 2015","true","40.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

When you're in the lead, the 2nd place car has that same 'tether' to you that all racing games have.\n\nThe AI is always ahead in terms of upgrades (example: Some cars already have rear-firing rocket launchers when I've only just unlocked the rear-shotgun), they seem to have an unlimited supply of nitro, they recover too quickly (a car will hit you with a pit maneuver, spinning you around 360, but it will continue on as if it passed through thin air), and some tracks have you start on an incline, which means you've lost before you start because you have to struggle to accelerate while the people in the front positions peel away because they started on level ground.\n\nAll the power-ups are made for dropping in front of people behind you, which is useless on two fronts. A) You can't get in front of anyone. B) Again, the AI recovers from tripping up too quickly for it to make a difference.\n\nThe only 'fun' events are the Sponsored Team Deathmatch events, because all cars start on something resembling equal ground. And that's the point of my rant. A game is fun when you win, and win with a sense of having actually competed with peers of equal standing. Not when you have to grind for $50 participation awards per race, just to get that $2000 exhaust upgrade that allows you to lose the race just three seconds behind the 7th Place car instead of five seconds. Except not, because by the time I get it, the other drivers will have upgraded their cars and widen the gap again.","March 25","false","18.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","6"

I don't know why i love this game so much but its possible that it's because GG reminds me of my favorite childhood game on the N64 called Vigilante 8. I only have one gripe about GG and that's the fact that you can't map your fire buttons to the mouse buttons, you specifically have to use the keyboard. I'm not to fond of this decision and one of the steam forum posts i read on the matter almost gave me cancer because a developer stated there was no use for having mouse controls in the game because it'd be a feature almost no one would use. With that statement i don't think the developers have any bloody clue how PC gamers play.\n\nOverall i would recommend getting this game while it's on sale, however due to the mouse issue and due to the devs apparently having no clue what they're talking about i only give this game a 7/10. It's a great game but without mouse support for firing it because harder than it should be.","March 9, 2015","true","17.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Not even close. It's your typical team based multiplayer (CTF, TDM) and there is no co-op option anywhere in the game.\nSeeing how the devs interpret co-op explains the overall lack of quality in the game. It's your typical "we've made a team multiplayer, let's call it co-op" thing. Also not enough players to fill up two teams.\nIn conclusion it looks and feels like a poor mashup of Blur, Flatout etc. Only recommended to genre fans.\n\nRecommended price point: 5$","December 17, 2014","false","1.7"," 21 of 45 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","21","45","0","0"

When you play a normal racing game there isn't really that much excitment, it seems that every race is the same and gets kind of boring. Even though there are different tracks and such doesn't really keep me intrested. This game however keeps me intrested enough to play more than regualar racing games. So what is so different about this racing game than others? Guns. On this game you get guns on your cars!\n\nGame PlayThe gameplay is fast and very furious. With mayhem that could happen at anytime during the races, from your car bashing into another or you shooting another car it really makes it satisfying enough to extend the playtime of this game for me anyways. There are multiple modes on this game which don't always require you to race other cars. Deathmatch mode is exactly what you would expect it to be. You and a few other cars get set with guns and you shoot each other with them, this also ties in with online mode, along with bots that you can go against as well. The game itself has so many modes that I can't really cover them all, just know that there will be a lot to do on this game to keep you entertained. The controls are tight, which is essintial for a game like this at a fast paced speed. There a few upgrades and car customization as you would expect in typical racing games as well.\nScore (Out Of 10): 10 - Very nice replay value and destruction. Along with loads of game modes to keep you intrested\n\nGraphics/Art StyleThe graphics of this game is beautiful. The cars themselves look amazing and relaistic, along with the terrain of the game, sky ect. The atmosphere of the game is really set by the graphics if you get what I mean. In some areas it feels really nice with the atmospheric graphics. With you being in the wasteland and all it feels like this is the right place to be shooting up other cars and destroying them.\nScore (Out Of 10): 8 - Very nice graphics\n\nMusic & SoundsThe music is alright while racing around and shooting your friends (maybe now your enemies) as you try to avoid their line of fire from their weapons. The sounds of each of the weapons firing isn't really all that, as usual just the generic use of the guns shooting ect.\nScore (Out Of 10): 6 - Would've liked some more music variety and sound variety\n\nConclusionFor the price of this game is pretty steep, but you will get a enjoyable gameing experience for it and would be very happy that you bought it.","March 1","true","1.6"," 8 of 19 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","8","19","0","0"

There is no peer/client listen server option.  The only way to play a private match with your friends is to run your own dedicated server.  Yes, the devs believe it's 1998.\n\n2.  The peak number of players in the WORLD at one time is 200-ish people, right after the Steam Xmas sale.  This will drop back down to a dozen on a busy day in a week.\n\n3.  Even if you want to bother setting up a server, opening up ports, and MANUALLY GIVING YOUR FRIENDS THE IP TO CONNECT TO (that's right, it's a quakeserver!), there's no steamworks integration.  Seriously.\n\nIt's like the devs decided they wanted to make a game with zero future.\n\nIf you can get this for $2, it's worth it for the singleplayer, but not much more than that, as by the time you can pick it up at that price, there will be no one in the world playing (that's 2 weeks from now btw), but maybe you can sucker a few of your friends to pick it up and you can pretend it's the 90s again and feel the nostalgia of setting up and running an external dedicated server that you give the IP to your buddies to play for 15 minutes and then never play again.\n\nPretty sure we'll never see another game from this developer.

However after watching some thrillers and played the demo, I became quickly addicted and bought instantly the game up. I never regretted it.\n\nI like a lot the fact the weapons must be really mastered before you can manage to destroy some cars. I saw in the past several car shooting games where you just had to shoot 3 times and the car exploded. The music is great. I loved the "Duke" cameo. And the graphics are awesome.

Just be wary of the high graphic requirements. I'm changing to a thumbs up because it really is a well made game for the money, it just seems to have requirements that exceed how detailed it is.\n\n\nOriginal Review:\n\nI really love this game but bad framerates and ugly AA really seem to ruin it for me. The version before the update actually ran better for some reason. I have other games that look way better and run at 3 times the framerate. Terrible programming. Once I can afford a couple grand for new video cards I'll see if I can crack 60fps lol. I can in Grid 2, Grid Autosport, Dirt 3, F1 2013 etc with all settings pretty much at max with 4x AA and 1080p\n\nI7 4790 3.6\ngtx 750\n16 gig ram","April 22, 2015","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","13"
