Also note that this is not your traditional dot point pro/con 5 second review. This is an editorial piece telling the story of how I fell in love with this amazing game.]\n\nAlthough I like to consider myself a true gamer-girl through and through, I have to admit that there was one single genre I'd never tried - an MMO. The whole "pay to play" thing was a huge hurdle for me when I was a child, and so despite my fascination with the idea of such a large, virtual community, everquest and the like were always out of reach.\n\nFast-forward a decade and times have unsurprisingly changed. With nearly all ♥♥♥♥♥♥mes becoming free to play, I finally had a chance to try out this genre that had piqued my interest for oh so many years. So around December 2012, I bit the bullet and started trawling through free-to-play MMO's, to see what all the fuss was about. And I have to admit, my first choices did not live up to my expectations. I tried games like Mabinogi and Rose online, but the combat just felt totally clunky and painful. There was little in the way of moving and dodging, with most of the focus simply being on casting skills with incredibly long cast times, and even longer cooldowns. Or alternatively,  just whacking something with a stick over and over ad nauseum, before it keeled over and died. The graphics were bland, the enemies were repetitive, and the story seemed non-existant.  I was beginning to think that I'd been seriously mislead about the nature of MMO's, and that they were all essentially just fancy IRC rooms.\n\nBut then I installed a lil game called Dragon Nest. Like my previous choices, I spent a large amount of time tinkering around in the character creator, eventually choosing a class called - wait for it - tinkerer. This is a cute little girl of about 13, who, when given the twin pigtail hairstyle, beared more than a striking resemblence to me at that age. The similarities were quite uncanny, which immediately grabbed my attention. Instead of roleplaying, I was simply getting to relive my youthful days as a young teen - something which meant a lot to me, being in my late 20's and utterly depressed at the fact that I'm not far off my thirties.\n\nBut the other games had nice character creations too, only to be let down by the game itself. So I wasn't all that optimistic about this game either.\n\nMy pessimism was shattered the instant I entered the game world. After a short introduction scene, I found myself in a beautiful snowy town, decorated with x-mas items and a nice big christmas tree at the centre of town, along with some really cheery christmas-y music. Not only this, but I saw many other characters running around - lil tinkerers like myself, sorcerers, and some rather charming looking clerics. The whole place was very pleasant and inviting, and I really felt a warm welcome to the game and the community as a whole.\n\nAs I ambled around the town, obtaining main story quests as well as side quests, I noticed that the story behind this game was very well executed, with lots of voice acting on all the main NPC's - a welcome change from static walls of text from mute characters that I'd encountered in nearly all my previous ♥♥♥♥♥♥mes up to this point. I was also approached by a polite warrior gentlemen, whom, upon noting my newbie status, kindly started explaining many of the concepts of the game to me. He also invited me into his guild, which I was somewhat hesitant about as I didn't feel I would be of any use as a newbie. He assured me it was fine, and that anyone was welcome. I'm glad I accepted the offer because I went on to meet many wonderful people, who taught me a great deal about the game and were more than willing to help me complete tasks on many occasions.\n\nInitially however, I chose to complete the dungeons solo, just to get a feel for the combat in this game. This isn't really an open world MMO, you simply have a town with many quests available, and then you have a closed instance field outside of the town for you (and any party members), with several dungeons being accessible from that field. This makes the game suitable for a wide audience, without needing too powerful of a computer (although don't get me wrong, the graphics are very pleasant too!).\n\nUpon entering my first dungeon was my next pleasant surprise. The combat in this game is amazing! It was how I'd imagined all MMO's would play, prior to actually playing them. I've been told this style is called an action MMO, and it plays somewhat like a first person shooter / third person shooter, with a huge emphasis on reaction times, dodging, combo'ing, as well as carefully choosing the most ideal order in which to carry out attacks. It's very frantic, but also very rewarding. It's easy to pick up, but very hard to master. Having tried other apparent action MMO's, I have to say that Dragon Nest hands down has the best combat I've ever experienced - it's THAT satisfying.\n\nI continued playing through about the first ten levels, but I was alone and in truth the game didn't feel that much different to single player RPG's that I'd played. This all changed when, upon my next visit to town, I was invited to my first party. I think this was the point where the game stole my heart, and I knew that I was going to be playing this for a long time. In fact, I ended up playing for 24 hours straight that very day, it was *that* endearing to me.\n\nThe game promotes teamwork heavily, with many abilities to help each other out in the form of buffs, debuffs, heals and the like. Not only this, but it was just simply fun to feel a part of something so grand. Even just chatting in town (which we ended up doing for hours) was immensely satisfying, and I met over 30 friends in that first day alone.\n\nFrom this point on, the game consumed me - I played it all day, everyday, whenever I had the free time to do so.  I was really eager to see what would happen next in the main story, while at the same time being happy to party with those of similar level (or even help those at lower level catch up to me). Before I knew it, my friends list was maxed out at 100. I had to tell people to add me and just send me a message whenever they wanted to party, as I had no room left on my list. Such friendships made me feel really happy - something that had been sorely lacking in my real life ever since an incident that left me scarred with PTSD, during which some brutish man tried to kill me (literally) over a road rage incident. He very nearly succeeded too, as he pushed my car towards a tree at 100 miles an hour, which I missed by mere inches. But I digress, this review is about the game not my own injustices.  I merely wished to portray that my friends here really helped me come a long way to recovering from this incident.\n\nSo back to the game now - at this point I was steadily getting through quests and making my way towards the level cap. So now is probably a good time to talk about the "pay" features that you have in any free to play MMO. Dragon Nest adheres to the policy of paid items being primarily cosmetic in function - this is not a "pay 2 win" game, and there are many well known players who have not paid anything for the game at all, whom are still some of the most powerful and well-geared characters on the server. Of the few items that *do* help make a character more powerful (namely jellies for enhancing items, and stamps for allowing to sell certain high grade items on the market) both of these may be purchased from other players with in-game gold, negating the need to spend real world cash.\n\n[Part 2 of review continued in comments to this due to length restrictions.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Amaurus/recommended/11610/","Amaurus","Amaurus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Amaurus/","133 products in account","Note: This review is a bit outdated (It was made at around 70 cap). Some of my complaints might have been addressed at this point but I have not played the game recently so I cannot tell for myself. Fundamentally this review is still accurate though.\nMy steam time for this game is not accurate. I likely have at the very minimum 1,500~ hours in game.\n\ntl;dr: Gameplay is solid and suprisingly good with a reasonable amount of depth. However, the grind from lowest level to max level (even with someone grinding you) can be nigh unbearable. The games optimization is hit-or-miss with many players computers as the optimization seems to be based on CPU power with it hardly if at all utilizing the GPU. In terms of class-to-class balance, the actual devs are fairly incompetent at making sure one class doesn't completely dominate the others.\n\nIn depth\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay of Dragon-nest is primarily fast-paced combat with heavy reliance on reflexes, ability to predict the enemy movements, and knowing your own skills. The combat has no casting bars rather relying on animations which makes you feel as though you are 'in control'. Many of the higher level skills do a satisfying amount of damage in PvE and a reasonable amount in PvP. In my experience, the end-game content (Dragon nests) often devolve DPS races to blow up the boss before it has a chance to do any of it's harder mechanics. Simply getting hit by some of these bosses could result in an instant death for you. Note: In the end-game content, after you die, you are dead until the raid (called 'nest' ingame) is complete or your entire party dies.\n\nPVP:\nPVP deserves it's own section because for many players it is simply all that matters in the game. PVP is largely player-skill based as a highly skilled player can easily combo the other player to death, giving the other player no opportunities to fight back. There are a few types of PVP in Dragon Nest which I will describe quite simply. There is Ladder, Endless, 1v1, and blacklisted 1v1.\nLadder is what many players might call 'competitive' mode with a rating, but in reality, it is simply an infestation of a single class. Gear plays a role in this mode and for many PVP'ers, no one actually cares about it, since gauging it as a metric of skill is completely stupid.\nEndless is simply 8v8 combat. Given its playercount, it is easily the laggiest mode for many players and, simply put, is a mind-less cesspool of high AOE skill-spamming. Gear does not matter.\n1v1 is what it is. Gear does not matter.\nBlacklisted 1v1 is different from what you might expect it to be. To give it a bit of a background, many players view some skills as overpowered compared to other skills (example: A mercenary's 'Iron Skin'). Most classes have a few of these skills and players will mutally agree to not use these skills. For some players, Blacklisted 1v1 might include entire classes or very specific rulesets and for many players, what is blacklisted to someone might not be blacklisted to the other. Most 'legitimate PVP'ers' play this.\n\nOne other 'important' aspect about PVP is PVP rank. PVP rank is arguably important because there is an icon associated with your rank. Initially, it is a brown egg icon next to your name. As you PVP more, you get more experience and the icon changes. The other icons are blue (silver) and yellow (gold). However, be warned, the blue and yellow icons are EXTREMELY difficult to attain as they are exclusive to a certain rising XP threshold. It is difficult to describe in words but simply put, if you were to attempt to become the player with the #1 amount of experience, it would easily take you a year of pvp'ing to get even close to it.\n\nSound:\nThe sounds of Dragon Nest are fairly average I would personally say, although, one of the key issues many players seem to have is that the voice-actors for some of the classes are borderline cringeworthy, prompting some users to completely disable the voice or download a foriegn language voice mod. Another one of the issues and to many players and advantage is that most if not all the skills have their own special voice-line for casting that spell. This means when your Adept (that's a class) casts Inject, every single time you are going to hear what sounds like a child say, "This might sting a bit!"\n\nGraphics:\nThe graphics are good and fantastic for many of the skills. However, some classes and raids (nests) in particular have crippling effects on many player's computers. One class in particular, the Alchemist, has a few spells that are strong in PvP simply because for many players, casting it is 'like opening six movies at the exact same time', resulting in a crippling half-second burst of lag.\n\nCommunity:\nThe community of Dragon Nest is fairly odd. A mix of Anime fanatics and normal people coupled with a loud creepy population. The population seems to be a mix of 12 to 19 year olds with some guilds greatly skewing this margin. I highly recommend finding a guild that suits your playstyle rather than joining one of the ones that you get invited to right off the bat. The best way to do that is make a friend in-game and try their guild.\n\nServer & Game Issues:\nThe server occasionally seems to have frustrating issues with lag. Sometimes these issues are extremely frustrating as they might completely void and entire 'nest', leading to a player missing out on loot. One of the most notable issues is the completely unavoidable 'Hackshield', and instant kick from the game resulting in the failure of the games anti-cheat. It is not detecting a false-positive, merely it just messes up.\n\nPay-to-win Factor:\nSuprisingly, this game isn't nearly as pay to win as I expected. The only pay-2-win'ish factor seems to be Dragon eggs and, even then, the only good thing that comes from them is wings which boost your characters movement speed in everything but PVP. When it comes to costumes, 'green' costumes boost stats which can pretty much only be purchased through NX (real life money). However, 'blue' costumes which boost stats much greater than 'green' costumes can only be reliably purchased through large amounts of ingame gold.\n\nOverall: The game is suprisingly good but has a good few problems that detract from some of the good parts. The game seems to have a large issue when it comes to grinding of either money or levels. There are minor issues with the community regarding it's vocal immature side.","March 1, 2015","true","443.6"," 63 of 65 people (97%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","97","63","65","8","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/destro-kun/recommended/11610/","destro-kun","Ultimate Shit Stain","http://steamcommunity.com/id/destro-kun/","424 products in account","For some clarification: I have played this game since Open Beta around September 2011, long before it was released on Steam so I'd average around maybe 5,000 hours give or take a thousand.\n\nThis game used to be the greatest thing since sliced bread. The combat is phenomenol, still kind of is. The story is gripping although a little trope-y. Most if not all of the classes are unique in their own way, each having their own playstyle. Now why would I not recommend this game despite all the good things, it's only because the cons heavily outweigh the pros.\n\nLet's start with content. Content is one of the biggest concerns I have had with this game for a while. The level caps have increased from 16, 24, 32, 40, 50 etc., with each cap including a couple of small 'nests' which are more or less instances with 4-5 bosses with some mechanics built in, a raid which is essentially like the nests only with 8 people instead of 4 and then the hell raid which adds a couple mechanics and makes everything stronger. Each cap lasts about 5-8 months with the exception of 40 cap which lasted nearly a year and some odd months. These months are filled with grinding the same dungeons and 'nests' week to week to try to get the best gear.\n\nNow we'll talk about gear. Gear follows a familiar rarity system, Normal, Magic, Rare, Epic, Unique, and Legendary. Normal to Rare is highly disregarded when playing Dragon Nest, if you're seen wearing them you'll be kicked from a party without hesitation, but we'll get into community in a bit. Epic gear is obtained from doing the nests over and over again for materials to craft. There's usually 2 different Epic sets for each cap, one being for magic-based classes, the other being for physical based classes. Unique gear is obtained from completing the normal raid and getting it dropped randomly. Legendary gear is recieved from drops in the hell version of a raid. Essentially to get the best gear in the game you essentially have to just have immense luck, and not to mention a team which can actually clear a raid consistently.\n\nGear does not change any part of attire except for your weapons, so if you're looking to be a fashionista without forking over some cash you're out of luck. When it comes to making your character not look like the average joe, you'll usually have to pay 15-30 dollars on a costume. A lot of the time you won't be able to mix-and-match costumes to get the "ultimate" look just based on the fact that you'll lose a set bonus. These set bonuses get better the more you pay up, and if you ever do feel the need to mix-and-match you'll have to get lucky buying gachapon and getting the single item that allows you to do so, did I mention you need one for each piece of equipment you wish to alter? That's not all, if you're looking to get the highest rarity costumes you'll need to fork over even more cash to get sets and fuse those set pieces together for a CHANCE at a higher rarity costume piece. Good luck!\n\nClass balancing is another of the bigger concerns with the game. Every so often there's a balancing patch, when this patch comes around there will ALWAYS be that one class that excells over all the others. This a lot of the time leads to people completely shunning other classes based on their tier list. And when it comes to nerfing a class, the nerf will just be making another class significantly more powerful than the other. If you're thinking about exclusively playing one class and still being able to join up with others then I'm sorry to say that's not the case.\n\nLet's get to talking about the community. It's a fairly small game so the community is kind of scrunched up. A lot of the people are generally really nice, but when it comes to actually playing the game, personalities may be a bit skewed. A fair bit of players, especially the people who have been around for a long while, which make up a fair portion of the game, are elitist in one way or another. There is a list of requirements for joining parties ranging from having proper gear, the highest enchantments, the best gems, etc. It doesn't matter if you're trying to learn how to do the latest nest or something to that extent, you will be kicked on the spot if the party leader is not appeased by your gear. This game is without a doubt not friendly to new players, I hate to say.\n\nPVP is one of the few things this game has left to offer, and even in that case PVP has had an incessive lag since the game was released till now.\n\nI could keep going on and on about all the problems with the game, but I feel I've covered the bare essentials. A couple years ago I would've recommended this game, but unfortunately it just fell into the usual Korean MMO loop of unfortunate cases.","December 13, 2015","false","879.0"," 92 of 112 people (82%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","82","92","112","10","3"

You are able to use your skills using the short cut keys "1-10" or change your key bindings to see which better suits you. Dragon nest consists of 2 game modes or 2 of both, PvP and PvE. You start off as PvE but later through the levels you can change to PvP or do both. The game consists of 8 Characters of which they have their own unique skills and abilities.\n\nClassesClasses have 'specialisations' where they can change into their first and second job and focus on that particular area of combat. Specialisations are granted at level 15 and level 44.\nThe 8 classes include:\nWarrior\nArcher\nCleric\nSorceress\nTinkerer\nKali\nAssassin\nLanceaFor more information of the classes and what specialisations they have go to the Nexon website @ http://dragonnest.nexon.net/guides/class-guide\n\nLike every game they have their pros and their cons. Here are mine:\nPros:\n+Gameplay system. The choice of movement and mechanics are great\n+Community. Everyone is nice but you do get the occasional person that isn't so nice\n+Exp rate. There are so many opportunities you get with bonus exp to level up your character as fast as possible\n+Simple. Easy to learn but takes practice to learn the mechanics of the characters. Practice makes perfect\n\nCons:\n-The lack of designing your character. The class you choose has already determined of what type and style you are. You don't really have that much of a choice to change your personal features, and the gender has been set to that class.\n-Repetitive. The game can get a little repetitive at times, doing the same dungeons over and over again. But it isn't really that much of a bother if you have a friend to play with you\n\nOverall\nI've played Dragon Nest when it was in Beta, but I've kept quitting and coming back 3 times. I've finally stuck with the game. Leveling can be hard at times and you have no choice but to the grind to get to the level you desire, but that's with most MMORPGs. When I reached the level cap, I thought it was worth all the hard times of grinding. You'll think that reaching the max level will be the end, but it's a whole new chapter and there are far more things to do and goals to be set.\n\nHere's my friend's guide for leveling:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=472939421\n\ntl;dr. it's good.\n\nFeel free to add me or ask me any questions in the comments!\n","July 1, 2015","true","340.4"," 55 of 58 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","55","58","0","2"

It starts off a bit slow but once you select your first class specialization(ie. Warrior-->Barbarian, Mage-->Fire Mage) the game becomes much more intense. The combat is easily the highlight of this game; the feeling of decimating a battlefield with 30 enemies on screen with a giant AoE attack is great! I only feel the character customization is lacking... Options for hair and faces feel limited and classes are gender-locked, so if you want to play as a male Archer, you're outta luck. Overall it's a pretty solid MMO with plenty of dungeons to try your hand at.\n\n4/5","November 29, 2013","true","643.5"," 78 of 93 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","78","93","0","1"

However playing solo can be quite boring sometimes so it's best if you get someone to join with you.\n\nAs with all games there are pros and cons, the most annoying cons I have found are the gender locked classes, and that certain cash items have to be bought with NX Prepaid (using cards etc.) not with NX Credit (using your credit/debit card and steam cash). Other than that the game is quite enjoyable, and isn't entirely a p2w game like most so called f2p games are.\n\nAs for PVP, pretty much anyone stands a chance at being good no matter what character they have, it all comes down to skill. Though according to various forums some classes are better than others, but I disagree as I have watched so called OP classes get absolutely destroyed by the so called lower PVP classes.\n\nThe quests and levelling system can be quite grindy and repetitive at times, but if you're with a friend you dont really mind quite as much since you clear the dungeons quite quickly, most of the time in under 5mins.\n\nI highly recommend this game for anyone to try.

So I installed it, thinking it would one of those F2P games that I would play for 20 hours and stop playing. My friend had a Sorceress from before and my other friend made a Tinkerer, so I decided to make an Assassin. I specialized him to Taoist, leveled him to 20, and got bored with him. I saw that the Tinkerer can summon a giant robot and hit things with a giant wrench, which reminded me of Max from Dark Cloud 2, so I made one. When I got to choose a Job Specialization, my friend had previously made his an Engineer, so I made mine an Alchemist. This is when I really dove into the game, finding out that most of the Alchemist’s abilities are really fun to use. At level 45, I got to choose a second job specialization; the Adept’s increased Fire and Ice power or the Physician’s increased Poison and Healing power. I chose Physician because I like playing healers. Now I have 350+ hours in the game and probably not stopping soon.\n\nWhy do I like this game\nI like it mainly because it’s an action RPG with fast-paced fighting and I love action RPGs. This game is not a freemium at all and very little pay to win(costume items give very little stats, and you can buy item protection jellies and revives with real money).\n\nWhy should/shouldn’t you play it\nWhile the gameplay is fun, I have many problems with it.\n\nBandwagoning: Raid parties tend to favor certain classes/specs over others and instantly kick the ones that are not meta. My main class, Physician is one of those non-meta classes and I have trouble finding parties since people favor Light Bringers over Priests and Physicians. This is due to the whole “Light Party” meta that is pretty much centered around Light Bringers, Crusaders/Inquisitors and Light converted DPS classes.\n\nBad model textures: The textures in my opinion are low quality and unappealing.\n\nAnnoying voices: 80% characters in the game have very cheesy lines.\n\nThe Tinkerer is a 11 year old girl: The Tinkerer is commonly referred as the “Loli Class,” and the fact that I main one makes me feel like a pedo. I just like their skillset that’s all.\nThere many reasons why I feel people don’t play this game. First is the anime-esque art style, since a lot people dislike anime. Second is that the graphics’ quality is bad. Third is the niche community of mostly otakus and weeaboos.\n\nOverall what do think\nI really enjoy this game. I find the gameplay fun and interesting with a high amount of replay value. I would suggest people to at least try it out to see if you like it or not. This is a good game to delve into if you are bored, so I pretty much recommend this for people to play.","January 11, 2015","true","557.2"," 38 of 41 people (93%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","93","38","41","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dracohandsome/recommended/11610/","dracohandsome","DracoHandsome","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dracohandsome/","207 products in account","Dragon Nest is an instance-based action RPG playing much like an arcade game with no targeting, a strict class tree, a less strict skill tree, and more or less no character customization whatsoever. For instance, all Tinkerers are time-travelers who somehow turned into adorable lolitas, and all Kalis are abundantly female spirit dancers with sweet, slightly shy temperaments and dead masters.\n\nMasters in their tribal ninja teachings, not BDSM masters. Moving along.\n\nDragon Nest's English localization is -incredibly- well-done, with dialogue that is not only legible but actually full of character and humor. The voice acting is goofy, but in a way that lines up with the character in question. The child king is nasally and distinctly lacking a courtly presence, while the storage NPC constantly complains about the horrible things other people / you leave in storage. The marketplace NPC will insult you for being poor (regardless of how much money you are holding because he's so damn rich.)\n\nDungeons have multiple difficulty settings, and the baddest ♥♥♥ dungeons are the titular Nests (though not necessarily dragon nests.) Abyss is the fourth and highest difficulty of any other dungeon, but it is the first difficulty of a Nest, and most of them have a Hell or Hardcore one that's much much harder than that. Nests are effectively your chokepoints for progress through the game, and at any given time one or more Nests will be the "endgame" dungeon. The catch is, you can only /win/ one given Nest a limited number of times every week. You can fail as many times as you want, but the great majority of items from Nests are only acquired after a successful clear.\n\nSadly, despite its charms, some significant flaws mar Dragon Nest and detract largely from its otherwise polished gameplay:\n- As said before, character customization barely exists and development is largely one-way-only - there isn't as freeform choice in character build as there would be in a standard MMO like WoW or Everquest II. It's basically an online arcade game.\n- It is possible to miss content. This is usually something trivial such as a non-title achievement, but it will still drive completionists up the wall.\n- The game is entirely instance dungeon-based with little to no open world. The exploration fields don't have any combat in them, nor any content other than NPC's to talk to and gates into instance dungeons (similarly to Sonic Adventure.) This can make the game feel very railroaded and monotonous.\n- Costume items, which are largely cash-only and non-tradeable, also give you stats and perks. This means they're not costumes. They're cash-only equipment.\n- Titles also give you stats, but the majority of those are acquired ordinarily ingame and you may use a display title different from your stat title.\n- As with most if not all other free games that have equipment upgrades available, Dragon Nest's equipment upgrade rate is abysmal without paying cash to improve it and/or protect items from destruction. These items thankfully can be traded, but as cash items they will cost a small fortune.\n- Holiday events, and events in general, almost never give anything permanent and unique. They give consumables and temporary costumes at best, or items that can be obtained in normal gameplay. They're generally quite underwhelming and unrewarding.\n- The keyboard control scheme is VERY awkward and can't be remapped.\n- If you like endowed girls at all you won't be able to play as Kali, because she's constant softcore pornography on the screen and very distracting. She's the only character with jiggle (Archer / Sorceress / Tinkerer are all B-cup or less whereas she's at least a D-cup with a huge butt) and her dance animations border on profane. This is especially jarring given her dialogue is written as though she is very sweet and innocent.\n\n\n\nDespite these flaws, the game is colorful and fun with only a couple friends. You can form guilds, but only four-odd of you can run a dungeon at once anyway, so you don't need to bring a legion.\n\nAnd Tinkerer is SUPER CUTE. Give it a shot and see if you like it.","December 8, 2013","true","88.0"," 28 of 32 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","28","32","0","0"

That is what gets me hooked on a game. I made the awful mistake of summing up this MMO with many J/KRPGs out there. I think most of these have very cliched story lines or have poorly written scripts. But Dragon Nest is not the case. If you're a fan of reading quests and PVP, this is definitely a game to try.\n\nThe story begins differently for each and every class you choose. Granted, they fit into the typical anime character archtypes, the boy who never gives up, the mysterious and talented but silent hero. However, their stories are interwoven in such a way that the characters interact somewhat differently with the NPC dialogues, making it interesting for different perspectives on the main story quest line.\n\nAs for the state of the game, the devs and GMs seem to pay attention and have interest in retaining their population as well. Spontaneous events occur that you simply click on and teleport to an instance for all sorts of strange games, some familiar and fun with great rewards at the end. The community seems to be tight knit, and the servers swell every time a new content pack is released, and then over the course of two months, dwindles back to a steady population. This is common and expected for most "themepark" type MMOs such as WoW as opposed to "sandbox" types like EVE online.\n\nThe gameplay is very fluid, and each class has a large array of flashy skills that make watching their animations very enjoyable every single time. Learning combinations and stacking them is highly addicting. The only thing that feels a bit weird is jumping, there is a very slight pause before taking off from the ground, but this is probably intended this way for fairness in PVP. In a game like Dragon Nest, bunny hopping could be an issue especially with melee classes.\n\nMODS! There are mods for this game from intricate skins to voice packs. In most youtube videos, you often hear the characters in the Korean / Japanese voice overs. Admittedly, I installed a Japanese voice pack and mixed it up with Korean as well. I understand neither of the language. But the game sounds MUCH better. The dialogue and the quests are completely in English. Even the cutscenes will not be a problem as they are completely captioned. It gives a more arcade feel to the game.\n\nOverall, Dragon Nest is a game that is definitely worth playing and worth recommending. Given Nexons track record on their game development, I feel that Dragon Nest is one of their better games and I hope the community grows and Nexon continues to support Dragon Nest. With its addition to steam, a steady influx of new players decide to give this game a try. It's very newb friendly if this is a beginning MMO for you, and free to play. Give Dragon Nest a shot!","February 14, 2014","true","62.3"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","26","29","0","0"

However with different starting points for every class trying to play as different classes with your friends can become an issue but you will find yourself back with your buddy in a while.\nThe classes are genderlocked so if you want to play as a archer or a magic caster you will have to play as a girl or if you want to play as the cleric or sword-wielder you will have to play as a guy. (Most people including myself don't see this as a huge issue but is worth mentioning.) Classes do have multiple paths depending on your playstyle.\nSo far the levels/dungeons feel easy even on the highest difficulty with little penalty for dieing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/werehowin/recommended/11610/","werehowin","Howin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/werehowin/","95 products in account","Edit: It seems the developers of this game have really sped up the update pace, which is good and slightly alleviates some of the issues.\n\nWhile it's combat is great and it sure did have a lot of potential as a game and is even actually enjoyable when things are fresh, it's not something I'd recommend playing in the long run if you're looking for something to invest a decent amount of time into. This is due to quite a few reasons, the combat is great and there was/is potential but the game has fell short in literally anything that isn't combat since release and continues to do so with no signs and a incredibly small chance of ever being fixed.\n\nLets start off with a few issues\n\n-Lag is common\n\n-PvP is not balanced and never will be most likely\n-PvE is not balanced and never will be most likely\n\n-New classes always eclipse previous ones and are overpowered in one way or another in order to promote new characters and purchases of costumes and other things for these new characters (A trend common in F2P titles). The community also supports this (Goes along with it IE: Bandwagonning,etc) and will not allow you to join parties if you're playing a class that isn't as good as some of the others sometimes.\n\n-RNG is HUGE in this game and very good at screwing you over with it (Probably in part to get you to pay for items you need to safely enhance gear instead of investing large amounts of time in getting gold just to try again)\n\n-Sub classes of each main class usually change from which one is best to again, promote buying class change scrolls and what not for money.\n\n-The graphics are worse than something from 2005 and the game is not optimized at all or something is totally broken. Even with current hardware don't expect 60 fps, it's always been like this.\n\n-A lot of the really nice purchasable things like mounts, wings, weapon skins and other things are only obtainable by dragon eggs. It's like a gachapon/lottery with a really small chance to get the items that are actually worth anything, usually you just get junk. Eggs aren't cheap either, $1.50 per single Egg and $30 for a 30 pack. You might not even get one of the good things you hoped for by spending that much either, there's people who pay hundreds to get certain items.\n\nNow none of this is the main issue with this game nor are these all the issues. I'd say the main problem with this game is the roots of it, the way the game is designed. The game is instanced based with town world hubs. You have dungeons with monsters and a boss at the end and nests/raids which you can do a certain amount of times a week.\n\n-Dungeons are useful for leveling up till cap.\n\n-Nests are useful for getting drops towards crafting gear and other things.\n\n-Raids are for end game gear, there's also a hardcore version.\n\n-Dailies can be done once you reach cap, dailies consist of doing the current cap dungeons in order to get certain items that are useful.\n\nSo here's the deal, level caps come with\n1) Filler content (Constant class rebalancing and fixes that never actually fix anything and just shift power for money)\n2) A new set of dungeons\n3) New nests and raid for each cap\n4) A new class\nYou'll get one good update every 1~3months with others being nothing special (Subject to change of course, I no longer keep up with the update pace/quality as of recently)\n\nSo.. here we go, you put so much effort and time into content which is not fun for more than a week at most in order to be able to be strong enough to enjoy the new good content that comes out every 1~3months. This content is usually fun for a week at most (Excluding raids which take more time to master/beat through typically). You do dailies every single day (if you can stand doing them), nests every week (that are boring once you've learned them which takes about a week because it's literally doing the same thing every time you do them over and over which goes for any content released in this game) and the same applies to raids after a bit too. You also grind dungeons for drops, maybe grind some other various things the game has for gold and that's.. it. The game itself is fun, the combat is good and all that but all you're doing in the game is the same thing over and over and over every day in order to gear up which takes time just so you can enjoy and participate in the end game raids. There's nothing else to do, it's all instance based and not open world so you're doing this or afking.. It's just.. a shame, it's not worth your time. You'll have fun at first but by the end of it the boring, repetitive, and chore like content you need to do to get strong every day and week heavily outweighs the fun you'll have with new fresh content.\n\nAgain, this is only the main flaw and only a flaw to those who aren't playing the game casually, there's a million other problems to this game stacked on top of it that I haven't mentioned aside from how static it is. There's better stuff out there to enjoy and Black Desert is coming too which has potential. If you're looking to play a game and enjoy/invest your time in it and have fun (The reason most people play games in general), this isn't for you. It's a great game to casually play though as the combat really is just that good.\n\n~Person who's played this game since close to the initial release","August 31, 2014","false","550.8"," 52 of 82 people (63%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","63","52","82","6","11"

The only critique I can make, as well as being an aspect that I really like and something unique about the game is the session-based arenas in which all combat takes place. On one hand I quite like having them in sessions and having a set objective and path each time, but it becomes repititive if you have to complete several quests over some levels in the exact same area.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Knux57/recommended/11610/","Knux57","TAW | Havinstroke","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Knux57/","58 products in account","The Good:\n-The best combat system of any RPG I've ever played. The system involves having an abundance of awesome skills at your disposal and several fighting game mechanics. The system is perfect for creating a ton of different combos that flow together very nicely.\n-Leveling up is always rewarding. Not only will you see very noticable differences in your performance with new gear, new skills are unlocked frequently.\n-While the class selection may appear small at first, each class branches out into 2 paths twice. So with the current 6 classes available, that's really like having 24 classes.\n-Each class feels unique. This includes the classes that are made from branching out. Lunar Knights and Gladiators may both be Swordsmen, but the only similarity between the two will be a couple of basic skills and their character model.\n-PVP has a great amount of variety. You can join a 1 on 1 lobby to fully experience the fighting game mechanics, you can participate in hectic 16-player team deathmatches, free-for-alls, and "kill the other team's leader" matches, or you can play the ghouls mode, which is a standard zombie mode that functions well as a completely level-free form of PVP.\n-Higher-level PVE and PVP demand a high amount of skill from players.\n-Leveling up is mostly painless. There will be patches of grinding you'll do here and there, but the grinding in this game is much less repetitive than in other RPGs.\n-Every skill you are given has a purpose. There are very few skills that become obsolete.\n-Tons of stat builds to choose from.\n-The voice-acting is full of personality when it's there. Voice-acting is most prevalent during combat, with many skills making the character using them say something. Important NPCs also have voice-acted greeting and farewell lines.\n-The main story is solid and easy to follow, even if you're like me and skip through most of the dialogue. It will also provide cinematics to spice things up from time-to-time.\n-If you put in the time to read it, the dialogue for main and side quests is well-written and genuinely funny.\n-Locations are very diverse and well-designed.\n-A unique art direction that combines cute with badass perfectly.\n-It's easy to find parties at peak player activity times.\n-Tons of seasonal and update events with useful rewards.\n-A solid guild system with features such as custom guild emblems, guild storage, and guild buffs.\n\nThe Bad:\n-The format of the world. While it's perfectly functional, it's a huge shame that this game isn't an open world. The only time you'll ever feel like you're in a populated world is when you're in a main town. As soon as you leave one, the only players you'll have any physical contact with is whoever is in your party, which only includes up to 3 other players at a time. There will be a few NPCs out in the non-main town areas, but they don't help the feeling of loneliness very much.\n-All PVE gameplay is instance-based, and the instances, while being highly detailed and just right in length, are usually a linear path. Sometimes quests will give you additional objectives besides getting to the end of an instance, but that only happens rarely.\n-Minimal character customization to start out with.\n-You'll have to ask around for info on the game's deeper mechanics such as paralyze, super armor, and knockdown.\n-Skills are not always described nearly well enough. Skill descriptions never provide information like how many invincibility frames a skill has, how strong it's ability to break super armor is, etc.\n-Armor sets that you don't buy with real money only have one appearence per rarity. For example, a common and a rare set of armor will look different, but a level 20 set of rare armor will look exactly the same as a level 50 set of rare armor. This happens in a few cases with weapons too, but not usually. Curiously, headgear is a part of all gear sets, but will never be visible on characters unless it's one of the epic-rarity headgears (which do actually have differing appearances compared to other epic headgears).\n-Server instability can be an issue at times.\n-The things that cost real money are terribly over-priced. A full set of cool-looking armor that gives some extra stat bonuses costs about $20, though you can reduce the price a bit if you're willing to "rent" the armor for a limited time instead. Having played Nexon games that use this format of over-priced microtransactions since 2005, I have never bought a single thing from these shops and have enjoyed the games anyway. As a side note, you can earn NX (the currency used for these microtransactions) for free, but the means of doing this often involve a LOT of personal information sharing to a LOT of shady websites. If you try to use fake personal information, you'll end up like me and get permanently banned from the service.\n\n(Overall, the cons aren't very significant, so just give this game a try)","December 19, 2013","true","104.1"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

The classes proved a refreshing twist on MMORPGs that many others fail to achieve. The combat is exciting and stylish on every class in both PvE and PvP even with unbalancing on classes. The story line is pretty interesting, if you decide to even pay attention to it. However this game is not without its fair share of flaws. I'll make a small list to explain some of the more pressing problems\n\n1. This IS a Nexon game, which if you know from their other games they treat the Chinese version of the game MUCH better.\n2. Stamina system, again another Nexon thing. Once you hit the (current) cap the game drains you stamina (called PWR here) in as little as two or three dungeon runs\n3. Juggling dominates PvP. You can find rooms that let you burn your PWR for medals known as "chill" rooms so it is not as big of a problem as the two above\n\nThis game is worth playing. However expect to be treated like crap by the customer support and just Nexon all together. It offers a great experience to both new and old MMORPG players.","December 14, 2013","true","252.6"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

Sure, the difficulty is p*ss easy until some end-game raids, and running the same dungeons over and over can get a little repetitive, but if you like mmorpgs with very flashy abilities, this is a great game. I remember reading once that the Alchemist class has an ability with so many flashing lights, it tends to crash people's computers (it then got blacklisted from many PvP tournaments). There isn't any real need to spend real money, as there are no pay-walls and the 'special' gear is mostly just cosmetics. I wouldn't recommend it for everyone, but it is free-to-play, so all you're really losing is your time (which I think is well spent, as it is always fun pummeling monsters). Another really nice thing is that the story is actually really interesting. Each character has their own story line too, and my personal favorite is the Assassin one, which has to do with time travel, though I won't spoil it.\n\n\nMy one problem with this game is that too few clothes are worn. But some people would consider that a plus.","February 23, 2015","true","143.1"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","67","10","15","9","17"

I was actually grossly excited about T5 finally fixing all the issues: the class discrimination, the elemental party imbalances, and I even like the new UI after I finally got used to it. I will miss the old content, as some of it I never got the chance to enjoy, but what can anyone really do?\nT5 was a long overdue update and altogether I think T5 has improved the game,\nexcept RNG on RNG. But I don't think that'll ever get fixed.\n\nYou can expect an action MMORPG, with a not quite as in-your-face 'give us money' campaign as compared to a lot of other free MMO's. If you hold vanity as a need you'll see a lot more difficulty on that front, as well as if you treat the game like a job and need the best of everything.\nYou can do end game content with a little effort without putting money in, but some people will always have a stick up their bottom trying to be better than everyone else. The game will be work if you do that though.\n\nWhat makes me adore the game is and always has been the combat though.\nIt is unlike anything I've had the pleasure to enjoy in other games.\nAs a veteran player whose put over 100 hours into the steam version, and at least 300-500 hours prior to getting the game on steam, I recommend the game, with all its troubles.","December 5, 2015","true","153.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

It was innovative and kind of first of its kind. The only problem I have with DN and the main reason I stopped playing it is- I felt lonely. DN is a race to the top kind of game. It wasn't like that in the beginning but slowly became that. Everyone is racing to the top/cap and then after a while you've got newbie towns that become an absolute desert, and you've got no one to do instances with. The only time those towns become populated again is when they release a new character. If you play this game with friends, then it'll be a fun game to play and I'd recommend it. However, if you're thinking about coming in by yourself, then I'd say don't bother. It'll be fun at first, but you'll eventually feel lonely and will stop playing.

I did my first actual transaction with them about a month ago. I wasn't a beginner by no means by that point but their transaction interface is well..for the lack of other words "confusing". Especially when you are purchasing via Steam it does NOT say if it's credits and/or what. "charge nx" okay so that doesn't tell me anything I'm sorry but it's true. "buy nx" that tells me it's some sort of game currency that's all it tells me.\n\nIf you plan to BUY anything from Dragon Nest I would HIGHLY advise you to read their terms first. I will NEVER buy anything from them again. Their customer support has been....superiorly unfashionable to say the least. If you enjoy the game so be it, and they even recently came out with kali class on the American version!\n\nGame rating: 4/5\nPayment rating 0.00000001/5\n\n","February 22, 2014","false","58.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Parties seek specific classes/will not play with specific certain classes so do your research first. Unbalanced class system. This applies to both PVP and PVE, but mostly to PVE. PVP is awesome and absolutely skill based, with equipment not so much [they nerf equipment to balance the playing field a little, better equipment is still advantageous].\n\n2. Plenty of guilds/active player base... HOWEVER they're not the cream of the crop people, there are nice players but more than half the time you'll deal with immature ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that devote a bit too much time [and real life money, with microtransactions reaching several hundred dollars] on this game. That being said, if you're looking for VERY active people to regularly play with, this is the right game.\n\n3. Free to play entirely... HOWEVER the microtransactions does give VERY NICE boosts in-game. For example, end game you might have.. 800k HP. But with a $30 costume, you can have 900k HP without having to buy expensive gear. Costumes can also boost your movement speed [some classes are SLOW AS HELL], which is kind of nice. Some costumes are really cool, like robotic wings... or a dragon mount/pet... even fun things like a fluffy sheep.\n\n4. Unbelievable amounts of grinding, there's no way to avoid this. You can buy powerlevels, have fun with that. Grinding for max level then for decent gear, because the bosses hit HARD and unless your skills can avoid the bills, keep farming that gear. Also when partying with people they won't even play with you if you have bad gear... so YOU BETTER GRIND.\n\n5.  Speaking of #3 and #4, microtransactions can be used to.. avoid grinding for money a bit. You can buy items with real life money, and sell in game for gold.\n\n6. Noncombat skills available, just not purely combat oriented. HOWEVER ... 3 skills: cooking, fishing, farming. No one fishes/fishing is completely useless. Cooking is likewise the same and the ingredients for cooking are so weird/hard to obtain that it's not worth it [have to rely on RNG drop rates, not gathering]. Farms are overpacked/almost impossible to obtain farm spots unless you can acquire a few spots and obsessively watch over your spot so no one else takes it.\n\n7.

Speaking of skills, very wide choice of skills, and specializations for your desired class.\nGraphics are brilliant, very well drawn, and simple. The way they should be.\nIsn't as pay to win as I thought it was gonna be.\n\n-Cons.\nREALLY, REAAALLLLYYY grind-esque experience, most of the game I was either grinding my character to the cap level, {which they are ALWAYS, changing.} Or, I'm paying others gold to boost me to those said higher levels.\nGame speed isn't always the best, as it likes to lag a LOT, It might just be me, though. Eh, who knows.\nGood variety of class choice, but they're genderlocked, so -1 for customization.\nThe very buggy, and annoying "HackShield" always seems to ♥♥♥♥ its pants at random times, causing the game to crash, and me having to reinstall Dragon Nest. Multiple times, If I may add.\n\nOverall opinion?;\nGood combat, good graphics, good storyline. but ♥♥♥♥ everything else.","August 2, 2015","true","206.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Agentflutters/recommended/11610/","Agentflutters","Agent_Flutter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Agentflutters/","42 products in account","Now, the veterans can defend this game all they like, but I started playing the game around the day that the infamous level 90 patch came out so let me release a review from the viewpoint of a new play who has reach level 75 and stopped playing due to immense boredom\n\nPros\n>Combat System\n-The combat system is the only thing that this game has going for it, you can pull intricate strings of combos and abilities\n>Classes\n-Each class is unique and awesome, I love how they all look\n\nCons\n>EVERYTHING ELSE!\n-Let me elaborate\n\n>Any dungeons below level 90 are SUPER MEGA ULTRA..... easy\n\n-Apparently, these dungeons USED to be difficult, but they decided to completely F***ING remove the hardest difficulties for all low level dungeons. The nests are easy when they used to require a party, (I MEAN FOR GOD'S SAKE, YOU'RE NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO PARTY FOR THE FIRST NEST) you take no damage while the enemies all die in one hit, and you can't even stumble over to higher level dungeons if you want a challenge because it's barred by a level cap, and by the time you reach the recommended level for the dungeon, it'll be too easy. I was waiting for the game to get difficult FOR 75 LEVELS. I WAS ONE SHOTTING EVERY ENEMY AND BOSS IN EVERY DUNGEON FOR 75 LEVELS! At that point, if the game can provide zero excitement for what was essentially 70% of the game, then it's not good game design. And I'm patient, oh I'm very patient, I'm always willing to give a game a chance, but this game could not impress me, it took too long.\n\n>Story missions progress way too slowly\n\n-I won't talk too much for this one. Basically, once you reach level 60, the dungeons that you have to traverse through for the story will have a recommended level of 45. Not to mention, really intimidating monsters appear in the story cutscenes a lot, and you end up getting excited at the fact that you'll be able to finally get a challenge, only to have your  character get stomped on in the cutscene and have the bad guy run off with the important McGuffin that you were sent to chase after and you instead have to fight some insignificant boss, that just basically ends up becoming a miniboss in later dungeons. But hey, at least there's occasional voice acting and almost every character has a unique personality why you can then elborate on through giving them gifts, but that's only fun if you're actually interested in this game's story.\n\n>PvP is "Balanced"\n-Unless you're playing with friends who are around the same level as you, you're essentially not allowed to PvP until you're level 90. Oh, don't worry though, there's and equalizer put into play so that your stats are basically increased to what they would be around level 90. The problem is that your skills still do garbage damage against players who have more points put into their skill trees, have better armor, and have learned their combos while you have nothing to protect yourself with.. The equalizer just makes killing you take like 30 more seconds than it should.\n\nDon't play this game unless you have a time machine. I've heard countless good things about the game before the update, all things that I wish I could've been a part of, but from what I can guess, the developers wanted to make it easier to reach level 90 to appeal to players who want have level 90 characters for all the classes, and for some reason they decided to remove content that didn't need to be removed in the first place.","January 7","false","67.6"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

Ya ya people say this all the time, but the 90 cap was just stupid, they removed Commitions, making it alot harder to get lv.s, they removed abyess(for most dongeons), and I was already ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that you could only aseasse abyess on dongeons the lv. before the next cap. they removed almost all the nests, sure they did make it ALOT easier to get armor and weapons but the Nest really made the game for me when I started back in 2012, they made a few skill changes which some Im ok with, but others like the Insane expensivness of buffs from 3 sp to 10sp(sure the start stats are better but still WAY harder to get buffs for support character in early game because you're too busy making sure your attack is high enough so that you do some actually damage), a big thing I don't like is the now EVEN BIGGER influance of pay to win. I've spent like 320 dollars on the game, and they just release better stat costumes makeing go back and buy more and I HATE that. Not to mention the utter excuse for a balance character Machinima, sure EVERYONE loves her, but only because she is Brocken as **** with WAY to high damage output, and now for endgame. Endgame in a nutshell. ready? Go! Grind Abyess Dgn for epic gear to sell and buy better gear/ grind gold forever, like said in manny reviews the gold drop rate is not much lower than before, now your barely making more then what people could make in 80 cap, which would be fine if the gear cost weren't so much more expensive then the 80 cap, like 500 gold just for a dragon gen ummm.... NO.Now i'm still going to be poping in and out of the game cuz I don't want to have the money I spent go to waste, but I give this as a warning to all players who haven't already done this.

It sports some anime inspired graphics. While still giving some insanely cool and much more dark detail to most mobs and each boss at the end of every portal.\n\nDragon Nest starts you out in a city called "Mana Ridge" which unfortunately seems like a cliche, because it ♥♥♥♥ing is. The game doesn't really start being eye popping until you step outside of the city and engage in your first dungeon. At that point I find you start to really appreciate the games graphical prowess and charming game mechanics.\n\nWhile being cliche with the story and theme, Dragon Nest really does well with its combat. It has you enter a portal into a certain area (think Guild Wars), and from that you can choose one of the varied number of "runs" you can take from there; you then have 5 options for which difficulty you want to run the dungeon on, easy for chumps or abyss for MEN. If I choose abyss (which the game recommends you only do in a party of 4), not only am I a badass mother ♥♥♥♥er. But I also get the advantage of better loot, and more rewards and XP at the end of the run. This part of Dragon Nest has always been my favorite thing in the game, even though the idea isn't original, and even though it literally has you do the same thing over and over.\n\nThat being said, the game sucks in these categories.\n\nWell, one category.\n\nPvP. When it was released, it was the biggest cluster ♥♥♥♥ you could imagine. It promised fluid attacks, and engaging combat. What it did deliver was a trash hitbox system and incredibly out of balance classes. One lower leveled warrior could hit a stun, and just slaughter people. It drew a very distinct line between PvE and PvP oriented classes. I played it again recently on a new character and while some of the before ignored issues were resolved (The hit boxes are much much better now) It just didn't have the charisma the PvE combat had and continues to seperate and distinguish classes as PvP or PvE oriented. Especially warriors. They still stomp everybody.\n\nSo, in closing. Although very cliche at a first glance, and lacking in PvP gameplay. The game does definitely offer an outstanding time for a group of friends or for somebody looking to kill some time online. If you don't mind being called a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ for playing anyway.\n\nnexon/10","April 11, 2014","true","81.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

If it looks different, it behaves differently.\n\nThe cut scenes are entertaining i suppose, but its really all about combat.\n\nLeveling does eventually slow down dramatcially, once you run out of the standard "go kill everything in this dungeon" quests, requiring you to re-play dungeons and boss rooms, over and over, just to level up.\n\nWith regards to the actual overall character progression, its mainly about upgrading your weapons (and armor too of course).\n\nThis is where the Pay to Win comes in, but ill get to that in a minute.\n\nIf you want to upgrade an item, you can minimally improve it up until level eight (the weapons level, not the character).\n\nEvery time you upgrade an item, you spend the materials to perform the upgrade.\n\nOccasionally, the upgrade fails, meaning you lose the mats but keep the item.\n\nAfter level eight, you risk several random outcomes:\nbreaking the weapon (or armor) entirely,\ndowngrading the weapon by 3 levels,\nmerely losing your mats with no change in stats,\nor actually upgrading the item by one level.\n\nThe potential to completely lose your item is very real, and is especially painful, making you go back to previously played content to get a replacement, which you would then need to upgrade again.\n\nSo, you can lose your item on a bad "roll" of the upgrade luck dice (metaphorical).\n\nWhat can be done about this?\n\nYou can pay real money to buy "seals", which protect your item from breaking. (but not from the other potentially bad outcomes, such as deleveling the item.)\n\nThe pay to win ethos permeates the rest of the game as well, with visual changes not actually being tied to the majority of the gear you can get through gameplay.\n\nIts sort of like if TF2 only let you buy hats, no crafting, no drops; they can only be bought with real money.\n\nThe other problem with these "costume" items, is that they also give your character stats, such as "permenant run speed increase of X %", or "+ str, + int" etc.\n\nNow, on to the PvP stuff!  This is where DN shines.\n\nThe PvP combat is epic, there are juggles, and tons of fun to use skills on timers (much like WoW).  DN combat is more about positional awareness, but it still relies on knowing what cooldowns are not active for your enemies.\n\nHowever, since there are juggles, if your "get out of a juggle" cooldowns are cooling down, then you're just hosed and can take a significant amount of damage while not being able to do anything about it, much like playing Marvel vs Capcom.\n\nThis issue is even more present, since you're fighting more than one enemy at a time.\n\nAlso, since DN is so focused on what gear you have and how upgraded it is, you are forced to play the PvE to level up, to get good gear, and to get the mats to improve your gear.  Additionally this means that PvP is more of a side thought, than a legitimate alternate way to level up or progress.\n\nOverall i had tons of fun with DN, but once you understand the upgrade system, why it is Pay to Win, and how PvE recycles content, id say its a worthy way to spend some time, but ultimately i felt cheated by its Cash Shop.\n\nBeware, Nexon may only be the distributor, but all of their games are notorious for abusing the Cash Shop mechanic, just like Dragon Nest does.","December 19, 2012","false","1.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Supro64/recommended/11610/","Supro64","Goat in a Taco","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Supro64/","21 products in account","Dragon Nest is probably one of the top 5 Free MMORPGs out there. With a top notch combat leveling system, and best in class PvP action, Dragon nest is defently a game that should be considered playing, if a fan of MMOs. The game starts you off with selecting a class of your choice and each of these classes have their own seperate main story lines that really add to the replayability. Keep in mind that these classes are gender locked and in total have 9 different options to chose from, The art style of the game is more anime and some of the NPC voice acting is hard to get through without cringing. The soundtrack is honestly top notch and when parred with the soundeffects of the game from the skills/abilities or simply basic attacking, creates an audio masterpiece. PvE inculdes a long enjoyable story sepperate for each class, alongside 100s of side quests and daily quests. PvP is extremely fun, arguably the best of all MMOs, all though, i wouldent recomend before level 35, due to most of the PvP community consists of max level charecters (90), and due to them being max level, not only do they have more experience, but they can easily trap you in a chain of attacks due to your lack of skills at a low level. Dragon nest is a heavily instansed bassed game, but if you can get passed the 5-15 seconds loading screens, this shouldent bother you. In the terms of character customisation, outside of the cash shop, your options are extremely lacking, however if you are willing to invest 5-10 dollars, you can begin to gain some freedom. On the topic of the cash shop, there are tons of options for not only costume, but actual in-game items aswell. Through steam you are able to use your steam wallet for the cash shop.\n\nPros:\n-Top notch combat.\n-Tons of content in PvE.\n-Outstanding party play.\n-Unique dungeons.\n-Very cool combat animations.\n-Dungeons rate performances.\n-Competative and Enjoyable PvP.\n-Main Story line differs for each class.\n-Consistant art style .\n\nCons:\n-Charecter appearence customisation is EXTREMELY lacking outside of the cash shop and micro transactions\n-Gender locked classes.\n-Some of the faces are just.....bad.\n-No customisable UI.\n-Heavily instansed bassed game.\n-Cringe worthy voice acting.\n-while yes there are a lot of side quests, some of them are straight up anoying.\n","March 13","true","53.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It is fast paced and entertaining. I will list some of the pros and some of the cons to the game.\n\nPros:\n-Cute chibi style animation\n-Unique classes and specializations\n-Live-action combat (yes you have to aim)\n-Good story\n-Supports different playstyles (pvp, pve elitists, and pve casuals)\n-Leveling is pretty easy\n-Decent ability to replay (reroll multiple characters)\n\nCons:\n-Repetitive quests (you will have to do the same dungeon several times)\n-Not new player friendly (takes a lot of getting used to as far as crafting, build guides, rotations, and how to obtain gear)\n-Not very challenging until higher levels\n-Cosmetics (costumes, while visually appealing, give stats and you have to pay real money for them, I am cheap so no thank you)\n-Small community (good luck finding answers to your questions, most people just wing it)\n-The running animation is hilarious in the worst way for all classes\n\nWhen all is said and done it is a very fun game that is easy to get into but difficult to get into competitive content. I would label it more as a casual game. For a free to play game it is not pay to win, but it is pay to look better than everyone else and have a bit of an edge as far as stats if you buy costumes and pets. It may not be perfect but it is a great game to kick back with friends who are tired of playing other things.\n\n","March 17","true","133.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

First of all, the combat is very good. When you attack and kill things it has weight to it. You feel like you are striking your foes. But that is all that is good in this game.\n\nTHE BAD:\n\nThe UI is clunky and not customizable at all. You can't even see more then one action bar. You can't move UI elements to appease. These are things that should be standard in any MMO since 2003.\n\nYou can't keybind more then one action bar full of actions. 1-8 is all you can assign and you have 3 classes worth of skills. This is nonsense.\n\nLoading screens everywhere! Join a dungeon, loading screen. Kill two groups of mobs, loading screen to next area. Kill a group of mobs, go to loading screen to next area. That is INSANE! More loading screens than a PSOne game.\n\nBalance. The game is way, way too easy. From what I read on the forums they nerfed enemy damage and increased EXP multiplier so that you can reach level cap really fast. So people migth think that is a good thing but to me, personally, it is not. Learning the game is half the fun. Do you really want idiots that barely know how to play in PvP and in your Guild because they reached max level cap in less than a week? There is no way they know their class.\n\nLoot at the end of the dungeon/raid is random. So it's very possible that you do a dungeon over  many, many times to get a piece of a equipment that you want. This is crazy. I had to do a dungeon 10 times before I finally got a better weapon.\n\nCash Shop is full of "7-day" items. You basically pay real money for temporary items. I know it's common in most Korean MMOs but this is complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. All real-money transactions should be permanantly tied to your account.\n\nAnother problem is if you go on hiatus for a month they lock your account. Don't be surprised if when you come back from vacation your characters will be gone. You have to contact support and provide detailed information to get it back. This can take up to a week and by then you probably don't want to play anymore.","January 13","false","2.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","1"

The game requires dedication, but if you stick with it the game can be extremely fun. The community is wonderful, and most people are willing to help. Make sure you join a guild because they will probably be more than willing to help you out. The first guild I ever joined was willing to gear me when I reached the previous level cap ( no guild I was ever a part of in Wow would do that). I am still with that guild and glad that I have stuck with them. The only real downside to the game is the time it takes for new content to come out. If nexon would keep the US servers up with the servers in SEA that would be awesome. So, in closing I would just like to state that dragon nest is one of the best MMOs you could ever play, but be prepared to spend some time and maybe a little money (only if you want to look awesome).","December 24, 2014","true","624.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Anyways if you are looking for an awesome rpg this is one to try out, but i must warn you, it is a pay to be able to kick ♥♥♥ in pve type of game, pay to win if you would like me to put it a better way. in this game if you want the best gear you got to be fully loaded not in cash but in gear, you have to be ready for anything the enemys throw your way and in order to increase your gear to top notch you need to spend cash so that you wont lose to the clumsy black smith who should be a pro at crafting gear . Anyways if you havent tryed this give it a try even though i wrote all of the above, give it a try it is a good game and if you like it and say to your self that you are going to dedicate your self to it, then spend cash on it ''pro tip'' leave the vanity items for last and craft your gear first. crafting your gear to 6 is free but byond that point it will break. look for the shop and buy jellys and you will be able to use that to protect your gear from breaking. oh and one last thing looks can be deciving in this game some people dont have good gear and can play very good and other look really expericed but they dont play that great so if they need help give em a hand maybe one day they will help you. teamwork is the keyin this game. 10/10 for me just wish getting jellys was much easy if you have questions about anything just send me a Message and il help you out with what i can.","December 10, 2014","true","23.0"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","1"

I have to say, Dragon Nest is the only MMO that I've gotten deeply into. I've found that compared to most other MMOs, this game has a much simplier way of going about things, which is a good thing, don't worry!\nThe combat is very easy to grasp, and quiet enjoyable with the big flashy moves and sweet combos :)\nThe ingame Marketplace isn't as terrible as some people say. I personally don't have any problem with it.\nEven if it seems like you get overwhelmed with the amount of quests sometimes, i.e. reaching lvl 30ish, just accept them all, and the quest menu really helps organize them, telling you how many quests per dungeon you have.\nThe community isn't the best in terms of finding other people who want to do the same thing as you i.e. low lvl characters looking for abyss runs, or looking for some buddies to lvl up with. Nexon could refurbish the party system to make it costumizable and have a better "search engine" in game to find parties with the same interests.\n\nThe only two problems I found that I have with the game are the Arena and arriving at the Lvl cap.\nThe arena seems to be 90% made of lvl 60 (lvl cap) players, leaving no room or welcoming feeling for anybody lower than lvl 42. :( Now there are the very occasional custom games of low and mid lvls, but its only about 1-2 of those games per couple hours, if that.\nArriving at the lvl cap...I have to say, I was extremely dissapointed. First off, the game has a PWR system, which is an in game "energy" system for doing dungeons. i.e. I'm lvl 30 doing a dungeon by myself, it will take 30 out of my 800 power for that dungeon. The amount used per person decreases, the larger the party is. Also if you are party with a "pupil" you are "mentoring" you don't lose any PWR for that dungeon. The PWR regenerates over time (1 day)\nBut...when you reach lvl 60, it uses 10x the original amount. Yeah...\nThis is what happened to me, I was lvl 60 and went to go help my lvl 32 friend do a dungeon on the hardest difficulty. Once I got to the dungeon, it tells me I have to use 198 PWR to do one dungeon. So in the "long run" I would only be able to help him with 5 dungeons in one day. A very large buzzkill i have to say.\nAlthough mentoring a pupil should not take any of your PWR in the dungeons, this concept has no effect at the lvl cap :(\nI do understand that this 10x the amount setup is to stop 3 lvl 60s to rush a lvl 1 through the game in no time or something similar. But if this system could be tweaked, it would be preferable.\nMy idea is that the mentoring system could at least cut the PWR consumption in half at the lvl cap, if anything.\n\nAside from those two things, I find this game to be pretty damn kickass :D\nWell those are my thoughts on this xD *looks up the page* -.- damn I wrote a novel... xD\n\nTake care gamers! Have fun!\n\n~Quazz~","January 30, 2014","true","237.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

But, as soon as you notice the countless connection errors, go ahead and shelf this one, as it won't be getting any better...\n\nI like games that let me play them [7/10]","May 26, 2014","true","25.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I have to say, Dragon Nest is the only MMO that I've gotten deeply into. I've found that compared to most other MMOs, this game has a much simplier way of going about things, which is a good thing, don't worry!\nThe combat is very easy to grasp, and quiet enjoyable with the big flashy moves and sweet combos :)\nThe ingame Marketplace isn't as terrible as some people say. I personally don't have any problem with it.\nEven if it seems like you get overwhelmed with the amount of quests sometimes, i.e. reaching lvl 30ish, just accept them all, and the quest menu really helps organize them, telling you how many quests per dungeon you have.\nThe community isn't the best in terms of finding other people who want to do the same thing as you i.e. low lvl characters looking for abyss runs, or looking for some buddies to lvl up with. Nexon could refurbish the party system to make it costumizable and have a better "search engine" in game to find parties with the same interests.\n\nThe only two problems I found that I have with the game are the Arena and arriving at the Lvl cap.\nThe arena seems to be 90% made of lvl 60 (lvl cap) players, leaving no room or welcoming feeling for anybody lower than lvl 42. :( Now there are the very occasional custom games of low and mid lvls, but its only about 1-2 of those games per couple hours, if that.\nArriving at the lvl cap...I have to say, I was extremely dissapointed. First off, the game has a PWR system, which is an in game "energy" system for doing dungeons. i.e. I'm lvl 30 doing a dungeon by myself, it will take 30 out of my 800 power for that dungeon. The amount used per person decreases, the larger the party is. Also if you are party with a "pupil" you are "mentoring" you don't lose any PWR for that dungeon. The PWR regenerates over time (1 day)\nBut...when you reach lvl 60, it uses 10x the original amount. Yeah...\nThis is what happened to me, I was lvl 60 and went to go help my lvl 32 friend do a dungeon on the hardest difficulty. Once I got to the dungeon, it tells me I have to use 198 PWR to do one dungeon. So in the "long run" I would only be able to help him with 5 dungeons in one day. A very large buzzkill i have to say.\nAlthough mentoring a pupil should not take any of your PWR in the dungeons, this concept has no effect at the lvl cap :(\nI do understand that this 10x the amount setup is to stop 3 lvl 60s to rush a lvl 1 through the game in no time or something similar. But if this system could be tweaked, it would be preferable.\nMy idea is that the mentoring system could at least cut the PWR consumption in half at the lvl cap, if anything.\n\nAside from those two things, I find this game to be pretty damn kickass :D\nWell those are my thoughts on this xD *looks up the page* -.- damn I wrote a novel... xD\n\nTake care gamers! Have fun!\n\n~Quazz~","January 30, 2014","true","237.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The day of December 25th, I went to charge money to the game through steam and it decided that right after I authorized the charge it was going to give me an error code. I did not have time to get the error code number because this has been an issue in the past but I went after 10 minutes to check and see if my NX had been charged, and of course without a doubt it was not charged. I began to search the website looking for ways to submit a ticket or get a refund. I then found out that Nexon does not hand out refunds under ANY circumstances. Which is understandable to a certain extent. Because that it was somewhere between their services and steam's services miscommunicated, I ended up losing $20 of my steam wallet money. I will barely put anymore effort and time into this game due to that situation and due to them not being able to do anything about them basically stealing my money. Even after the purchase showed up on my steam wallet purchases. Thanks once again Nexon for taking my money and ruining my Christmas of 2015.","December 25, 2015","false","68.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

(unless they have a friend/guild willing to hold  their hand)\n- NO BENEFITS for helping new players.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/icantw8/recommended/11610/","icantw8","Icantw8","http://steamcommunity.com/id/icantw8/","30 products in account","No longer recommending Dragon Nest after playing Since Aug 2011. I only recently started playing using the Steam engine which is why I only have a few hrs on record.\n\nI usually pick up this game when there's absolutely nothing else to do with my time, but now, I see no reason to even bother logging in. The servers have always lacked stability as far as I can remember. Anyone who's played since 40 cap can tell you how bad it gets. For an MMO, it's not a BAD game, but the server stability is what ruins it for me. (More on that later)\n\nLooking into how bad the server is, sometimes you will disconnect for no apparent reason. It could be right in the middle of a boss battle or raiding. Other times, it could be when you get a good roll on a rare drop and suddenly you get kicked from the server. This has been going on since 40 cap which was already more than 4 years past and Nexon has hardly done anything to manage this problem.\n\nThe community is more of the same. You'll meet nice people who just want to play for fun and get by and other times (mainly in PvP) you'll meet a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ elitists who think they're all that. For an MMORPG, it's nothing spectacular.\n\nClass balance will always be an issue in the game. Even before the sub-classes came out in 50 cap, there was still class imbalance mainly in pvp.\n\nGearing up chars for certain classes will be heavily dependent on how popular that class is. The more "higher" that class, the more expensive and tedious it will be. Again, nothing notable since it's like this in most MMORPGs.\n\nIn this game, you'll get 2 nests (or one nest in level 24 and 32) starting at lvl 40 cap for every 10 levels which is like a dungeon but with slightly stronger bosses and mobs with higher rewards. Also starting at level 40 is a Raid which you can team up with 8 players (instead of the usual 4 in dungeons and Nests) with even greater rewards. One issue with this is that the nests/raids will get progressively easier as you level up. A lvl 60 will have no problem doing a level 40 raid, even all by himself.\n\nThe focus of the game is to level up your character and get the best gear possible by doing raids or nests. Alternatively, you can gamble by paying real money but you will instead earn "cash-equipment" which is exclusively obtained by spending money, creating an unfair advantage to those who spend money on the game as opposed to those who don't which has always been Nexon's formula. See their pattern now?\n\nPicking up this game was both a blessing and a curse. Having only spend 200 something dollars did NOT detriment my savings but I rather instead spend it elsewhere cause Nexon honestly doesn't deserve your money considering how little they put in to making the game better for everyone. The game leaves a lot to be desired since the popularity is shrinking by the ten-folds and the same content is being recycled, thus making the game dig deeper and deeper into its failing timeline.","February 1","false","4.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The story is boringly repetetive and cliche, the servers lag in most countries so you will teleport back and forth and not be able to hit anything, the community is pretty much non-existant and the people left are max level so they'll ignore you, the devs changed the difficulty system so you may now only play the early levels on the easiest settings, and worst of all: the game is far too easy.\n\nIt seems to have the opposite problem to most mmos, in that it's not 'grindy' or difficult, it's just running through every dungeon and killing everything a few times and then moving onto the next dungeon (It is grindy in that aspect). It feels more like a poorly made and boringly long singleplayer game that still has the lag issues of being a f2p asian mmo. Playing this is just like waiting for the ending to come, and if a game has that quality, then just go back to real life since it's the same ♥♥♥♥, but with characters that actually matter.\n\nThe only way I recommend this game is if you bring together a bunch of friends and play through it in short bursts as a party whilst not taking it too seriously. In 2012/13 you could have done this with players you met in game, but now the only community left are at max level as stated.\n\nBase Game: 7/10\nWhat You Get: 4/10","April 21","false","45.1"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","8","17","2","8"

The graphics are subpar compared to other games such as Aion: Ascension or Guild Wars 2, but it gets the job done. The main point of Dragon Nest is definitely not graphics\n\nStoryline: 8/10. The storyline is centered around your specific class saving the world, which is kind of stereotypical, but once you get into the game, it goes into the lore. Such as the  aging difference of archers/elves or how the Cleric becomes high priest of an organization. Really tedious to start, but great to read through once you've gotten interested.\n\nMusic: 6/10. The music kind of just... fits. Although, during dungeons it can be quiet until you start attacking an enemy, but once the music gets going, you really get hyped for battle and it makes you have a sense of urgency.","October 18, 2014","true","373.6"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/solonazgul/recommended/11610/","solonazgul","SoloNazgûl †","http://steamcommunity.com/id/solonazgul/","140 products in account","Dragon Nest. The best F2P MMO I've experienced.\nI have been playing this game since the level cap was 40 and I have enjoyed every minute of it. First off, the story is really cool and some might say cute or should I say "kawaii". Most of you probably just roll through quests but try reading it at first because you might actually enjoy the conversations and it will give you motivation to keep questing. Even if you don't like questing there is an aspect of "grinding" to level up and it is significantly faster but I don't suggest it because you might get bored too quickly. There are currently 7 classes to choose from which are Warrior, Archer, Cleric, Sorceress, Kali, and Assassin. Each class branches into newer ones at levels 15 and 45. You might to do research on your class before you make your decision because you may branch into a class that you like but not as much as the other options that were available. The graphics in the game are pretty OKAY, I would say it's a very anime-styled game looking at all the characters and voices. Aside from that, the gameplay is what's truly amazing. Skill animations and effects are 10/10 and don't get me wrong there are ALOT of skills for each class which makes the game exciting. You can chain combos any way you want and there is dodging in the game as well as blocking and parrying for some classes. Most of the motivation I got to level up was to obtain new skills to use because they were all just so sick. There's PvP in this game with a variety of game modes and maps that are also exciting though I'm not much of a PvPer but I can say it is very fun if you're good at it. There are several dungeons to do to level up then there's the Nests as end-game aspect I would describe it. There are currently 3 different Dragon Nests (this game wouldn't be called Dragon Nest for nothing) which are Sea Dragon Nest for level 40+, Green Dragon Nest for level 50+, and Desert Dragon Nest for level 60+ . All of them are different but are all packed with intense boss fights so it requires alot of coordination and communication. There isn't alot of equipment in the game and by alot I would mean a gazillion different things like in Borderlands. Rather this game has a fixed number of equipment for each class but that doesn't change     how exciting the game is. You would keep playing to obtain the best of equipment either way and don't get me wrong it is a long journey but that's what makes the game fun! I've been running my own guild for long time now and I've made alot of friends but playing it solo is anyone's preference. Nexon frequently hosts events packed with rewards and there are always updates to come with new content and just everything about this game makes you excited once you get into it.\n\nThis game is one of my all-time favourites and it is F2P.\nI'd recommend it to anyone looking for an exciting and fun MMO.","July 24, 2014","true","384.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TShirtTurtle/recommended/11610/","TShirtTurtle","Alfredo Jones","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TShirtTurtle/","228 products in account","Nexon has developed a reputation for releasing games that, while great on a gameplay level, are filled with microtransactions and alterations to the game to force you to buy them. While Dragon Nest continues this legacy to a degree, it's not as bad as other games the company has put out. From a gameplay standpoint Dragon Nest is very fun with its combo-based combat. The six classes (as of this review) are all fun to play in their own ways, and the specializations they can take let them further define their styles in unique ways. While the early levels can be a bit of a slog, once you get to around level 30 the game really opens up in terms of the skills you get. And whether your fighting alone, with a friend, or against a friend the combat is always enjoyable.\n\nIt's unfortunate then that the rest of the game around it is a little shallow. Quests are your standard affair, either go here and kill this or go here and collect this. A few quests spice things up in interesting ways such as giving you an overpowered NPC helper or giving you a unique enemy to fight, but such quests are few and far between. Thankfully if fighting AI monsters gets boring you can always fight your fellow man in PvP. PvP is fairly balanced (with a few exceptions) with an emphasis on personal skill rather than your gear and stats.\n\nThis brings me to the much despised part of any Nexon game, the cash shop. While games like Mabinogi and Maplestory are pretty much pay-to-win when it comes to their cash shop, Dragon Nest really doesn't feel that way. Sure the costumes give nice stat boosts and there are items that protect your gear from breaking while enhancing them, but such things aren't necessary unless your absolutely serious about min-maxing. Even then you should be fine as long as you invest in a decent skill build and have practiced enough to use your skills to their fullest. You even get a special level up reward box that gives out certain cash shop items like storage and inventory space, meaning you don't have to spend a dime so long as your patient.\n\nI have a feeling alot of people have/will blow this game off just because Nexon is publishing it, which is a shame. While it has its flaws Dragon Nest is a pretty decent action game if you put some time in it. It might not be the best game ever but it certainly is leagues above some of Nexon's other games. I advise you to give it a try and at least play up till level 30 or so before you pass your final judgement on the game.","November 26, 2013","true","029.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I can't really think of anything I don't like about it, although I'm sure there's a few flaws in it, they're certainly not significant at all. The art is genuinely pleasing for an anime-style game, there's a pretty good choice of classes, with my only complaint being that they are genderlocked, but I haven't really found that to be much of a problem, personally. I like all of the dungeons and how they all have their own theme and the different difficulties are definitely a nice bonus. I find that it is also quite possible to be good at the game without spending money on it, and the Dragon Vault gives good options for character customization by allowing different durations for the equipment items, along with stats on most of them. I find Dragon Nest to be an all around amazing game, currently my favorite, and I would definitely recommend it. :)","November 30, 2013","true","13.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I took the time to try out different classes to see how they were and I can say each class seems worth playing, never did I feel like any class was downright boring, useless or underpowered. You do normal attacks using the left mouse button and special attacks, which are usually kicks, with the right mouse button. One thing I didn't quite like was the fact that your skills are all placed on hotkeys, which imo, defeats the purpose of this game being an action mmo.\n\nThe graphics are childlike in appearance and remind me a lot of the Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles series though it's a little disturbing how this game is with certain female characters and also "panty shots".When you create a character, you get a choice between 3 or 4 different hairstyles and clothing options, giving this game very minimal appearance customization.\n\nOverall this game seems good for what it is but I can't recommend it over Vindictus though for people who don't care for Vindictus, you could certainly do worse than this game.","August 14, 2014","true","30.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

C9 and Vindictus are dead, Dragon Nest is still very much alive.\n\nThe combos aren't nearly as good as C9, which makes it very newbie friendly, but at the same time the Raids are much more difficult, catering to the hardcore players.\n\nIf you give this game a shot, at least play until level 24, when you get the fun skills. When I first tried it out I dismissed it at level 12 or so because it was generic, but obviously I just didn't have any of the good skills by then.\n\nThey really did a good job distributing buffs and debuffs throughout the classes, every raid contains no multiples, and the ones that do only have one or two, making most classes desirable.\n\nAs for p2win, you can get virtually everything by grinding, which may take a bit, but it's certainly not as p2win as most other F2P titles.\n\nThe only major downside is the gender locked classes, the tinkerer looks like she's an 8 year old girl... But if you can see past that, it's most definitely one of the best games out there.","December 1, 2013","true","344.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

You dont see a move go right through a monster or player and see a -MISS- icon. The only way to miss is to have bad aim.\n\nBe prepared to devote your life to this game, and be willing to give up your soul.\n\nEDIT\nI guess i should be a little more precise.\n\nPROS:\nCombat System: COMPLETELY INCREDIBLE. This is a 4/5 year old game, and that fact there are no target locks, and no other game that i can think of with a combat system that also DOES NOT USE target locks, makes this game stand out way above the others. If you miss, its just bad aiming, or the inevitable lag.\n\nStory Line: Ive only played one class completely to the current level cap storyline (80 atm), and i absolutely love it. People say that MMO storylines arent the greatest, and i understand that having played few other MMOs as well, but i have to say DN has a amazing storyline (For Kali class anyways, havent branched out into other classes as much.)\n\nLeveling: This is not a grind-cringing spending months to hit level cap. In fact, just recently they LOWERED the needed exp needed to level up per level. If you no-lifed 4 days, im pretty sure you could be level cap, or really close.\n\nContent: The amount of content in game is enourmous, albeit alot of it are lower cap level nests and such. But the game doesnt totatlly abandon, having weekly nests to have a chance of getting level cap equipment to gear up. But the thing that kept me playing for 6000+ hours was the raids. Finding a dedicated group of 7 other people, to learn, and defeat the dragons every level cap, and finally doing it for the first time. That'll never get old.\n\nCommuntiy: Ive met alot of nice, friendly, funny people in this game. There are alot of people in here that are willing to help you, whether through tips or finding someone to leech out of (dont leech please), to make youre experience be a good one, and helping you learn about your class. I spent so much time in game, in chat systems talking to these people, theyre family to me. More so than my real life friends.\n\nCONS:\nCommuntiy: The saltiest people are in this game. I swear they eat a bag of salt before they start playing everyday, thats how salty there are. But ofcourse, every community has those right? Dont be suprised to meet one. Want some help running level cap nest? If you join a party and you dont have decent gear, -permakicked from party-. But they did add diffilcutly levels to nest, so i guess it balances out..... to a point...\n\nLatency: THIS IS THE SINGLE THING KILLING THIS GAME (Well nexon in general). DDOS on MapleStory AFFECTS DRAGON NEST BECAUSE WE RUN ON THE SAME SERVER. Why? Cant they afford dedicated servers for Dragon Nest? Im pretty sure they can from the $$$$ people spend in this game for cash shop items. Lag is so bad, it affects pvp, character skills going off when youre juggling them, getting hit by stomp mechs WHILE IN THE AIR, and just bad lag in general. I know there will always be lag, but when people start mass dcing from the world, then yea, im pretty sure its not our bad comps. Also PVP is a terrible mess. A beautiful, stunnin, bright, and at times, VERY VERY LAGGY MESS. But i digress...\n\nRandon Number Generator(Cash Shop, Enhancing, Etc): Alot of beautiful costumes, pets, wings etc. Too bad the Random Number Generator is terrible. Want the newest wings? Buy a 30 egg pack, worth $29.90, and hope that RNGods are with you. Ive seen people spend THOUSANDS trying to get things in those eggs, myself included, and to be dissapointed in my bad luck. Want to enhance a Legendary Grade weapon to +12? Good luck grinding for the gold, to just see it gone in 1 try, that probably wont succeed anyways. With so much people spending money on this game, they should atleast compensate those who spend past a certain limit. i mean, to spend a months paycheck in one go... and to get nothing in return... yea thats definetly not worth it.\n\nCONCLUSION\nWould i recommend this game? Hell yeah, this is a awesome game, with not that bad graphics, and a incredible story line and combat system. Find the right people in game, find the right group to do stuff with, and to find a right guild to be a part of, then this game will be very enjoyable. Dont try to be a leecher, cause many people WILL ignore you, or avoid replying to you. Plan on spending on this game? Your choice, i gave you my outlook of the cash shop, but i guess if youre lucky, it wont be so bad. But ive seen so many unlucky people. But one word of advice, if youre still trying out the game, make a decision whether youre not youre planning on playing for the long term. In any game really, you should debate if youre going to or not. Would be a waste to spend $$$ just to quit a month later.","October 5, 2014","true","700.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

I wouldn't say that all people who enjoy anime would enjoy this game, its just a common trend I've seen in players.\n\nThings that I've been Impressed in this game:\n\nSTORY: As a F2P game, its got cut scenes and great voice acting for many of the characters. If invest the time, you can find a variety of amusing and deep storyline in the game.\n\nUSER FREINDLY: Well, its a typical Fantasy Rpg, with skills binded to action hot keys. The Games Dugeon to Dugeon action makes playing the game simple and user freindly.  Death dosn't have a major penalty and PVP play is available in specificl chanaels.\n\nRE-PLAYABILITY: This game encourages replay ability, if gives you XP buffs to your characters though the Unified Skill system, you have Server (cross character) storage as well as a mailing system to send stuff back and forth between characters. And since theres multiple characters with multiple prestige classes, theres plenty of variety in game play styles.\n\nIf you haven't played a Nexon Game yet, you shoudl definitely give this game of Vindictus a try.

This game is not only a themepark, but I've never seen smaller themepark levels in my life.  I mean, it's like you go into a large closet, when you kill the mosters in there, all 8 of them, you move to a new closet kill another few monsters, and then another.  What?  That's a game?\n\nThere's no open world by any stretch of the imagination.  This isn't even remotely an MMO.  If you could compeltely revamp the game so you could actually explore a world without hitting a zone exit every 3 seconds (and I mean, 3 seconds), you might have had a decent game here.\n\nI have no idea how people can play games like this, especially if your first games MMO's were UO, AC, EQ, and so on.

But if you're like most people with a job, you'll end up spending hundreds of dollars, if not thousands of dollars, into this game.  Note that money spent mostly cosmetic.  I used to have one of each class maxed and fully geared.  I was also #1 and #3 in PvP ranking in the server I was in, and was a leader of moderately successful PvE guild.  I played this game for over a year and it was fun at the time, and the raids are done well.  But the main thing about this game is that it lacks content.  Whatever they do have is pretty good, but the fact that you're forced to grind same thing over and over and over and over, just isn't very entertaining.

I put together a short list of pros and cons for your studies.\n\nPros:\n- Nothing\n- Zero\n- Nada\n- Zilch\n- Did I mention NOTHING?\n\nCons:\n- Everything\n\nSorry. I'm just very angry right now. I'm going to go eat a salad.","July 27, 2015","false","0.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

But if you're like most people with a job, you'll end up spending hundreds of dollars, if not thousands of dollars, into this game.  Note that money spent mostly cosmetic.  I used to have one of each class maxed and fully geared.  I was also #1 and #3 in PvP ranking in the server I was in, and was a leader of moderately successful PvE guild.  I played this game for over a year and it was fun at the time, and the raids are done well.  But the main thing about this game is that it lacks content.  Whatever they do have is pretty good, but the fact that you're forced to grind same thing over and over and over and over, just isn't very entertaining.  I may have recommended this game in the beginning, but soon you will see why I can't recommend this game.\n","February 11","false","499.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I plan to do so though.\n\nAs with all of my other reviews, they will be scaled from 0 to 10 on a few criteria.\n\nGameplay: 7.5/10: This game would get a perfect 10, if a few things were reduced/removed. A. GRINDING, Be prepared to grind your ♥♥♥ off in this game. When the game's level cap was 50, it took me several MONTHS to hit 50 on my non-boosted toon. B. Gear Upgrading, Ok, so in this game like classic Nexon fasion there is a gear upgrading ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t system. You have to spend real money to get anywhere near past about +10 on your gear, though some people are generous enough to post the jellies on the Auction House, for ♥♥♥♥TONS of Gold... These are the only things really hampering the gameplay. Otherwise, it's very fun, action based MMORPG with alot of flashy skills.\n\nGraphics: 9/10: This game would again get a perfect 10, if 1 thing was tweaked. visual effects of the Tinkerer class. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSSuRETYUU8 watch that video if you want an explination (a very funny one)\n\nAudio: Japan/Korean Voices: 10/10: American Voices: 8/10:  There used to be a mod for the game that added in the Korean voice actors for all of the classes, but it didnt continue after about Kali got released, If I could read Korean, I would be playing KDN because the voices are like 3000x better in that game. The american ones are just a bit too cheezy at some times, though some lines are funny. also, Shield Charge in KDN is one of my favorite lines along with the American version of Justice Crash.\n\nOverall: 8.5 out of 10. I'm actually going to agree with IGN on this one, it's a good place to dip your toes into the F2P genera of games, and a good place to stick. PvP is fun, PvE isnt that bad, just alot of grinding. If there was a Maybe button for the Do you recommend this game, I would probably hit that one, but Yes will be good enough.","January 15, 2015","true","137.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

Mainly with Hack-Shield. Once you get it working, have fun with your addiction. This game is pure fun. I can't get enough.\n\nThe developers goal was to basically combine console level Hack'n'Slash gameplay with traditional MMORPG features. And it worked. It worked so well. The character customization is a bit lacking, but it is still there. The game is not a money sucker by any means. When they same Free-to-play, they mean free to play.\n\nThe graphics overall are not the greatest, even on max settings. But as long as you are not a graphics Wh*** you should be fine. But overall, the graphic style is very nice. It's bright-ish Anime inspired graphics are not exactly new to the MMO genre, but overall are nice.\n\nI haven't even gotten to the Combat. Oh my, I can not get enough of this gameplay. The combat is absolutely gorgeous. It has your basic left-click attack. Your right click is your special. And then you have your skills, the skills are respectivly on the number keys, which does take a little while to get use to at first. But after awhile it won't be so irritating.\n\nThe music in this game is also quite beautiful, and works perfectly in the background to build tension. It is no Kingdom Hearts or Elder Scrolls, but it is still quite nice. The composers did a nice job.\n\nGameplay 9.7\nSound 8.8\nGraphics 7.6\nReplay value 10\n\nOverall 8.9/10\n\n~RadiantNight7","April 6, 2014","true","22.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I'll start with the bad: the game is very cookie cutter, story line, level grind, being usless untill level 20, and so on. I have also seen better graphics, WAY BETTER. The game also feels frustratingly easy, but takes a long  time. It's like every other F2P MMO out there.\nBUT WAIT THERE'S MORE!\nNow for the good stuff; the game is adorable, the npc's have funny personalities, It's quick to understand, and really fun, almost relaxing. But what is really unique about this game is the community. I was playing for the first time trying to figure out what to do and bam, in the first FIVE minutes I met three people (all higher level than me) just hanging around, who invited me to their party. Two minutes later they where going on all my quests with me and showing me what to do. They helped me until I reached lvl 10 when I had to get off and catch some sleep. We have keept in touch since then but it's really cool how I met them so soon and how friendly they where, I'm used to playing games where nearly everyone is "lone wolf" kinda thing but It's really nice to have people to party up with and just hang out.\n\nI'm keeping this short and sweet so overall first impression is: I'm No longer forever alone. This game is fun, have some paitience, give it a try :P.","June 8, 2014","true","9.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I play with my best friend and we have fun clearing the dungeons on the harder difficulties. I love experimenting with each class. (can't wait for the assassin!) I also enjoy the contrast between the character looks and the monster looks. It goes from "oh, that's nice." to "Oh GOD oh, what the hell IS that thing... THAT'S AN ORC??!! I've never seen an orc like that before. Who designed these monstrosities??!! WTF is goin on????" I love every bit of this game and I'll spend endless hours playing it in the future. Take note NOT to be discourged because of the gender-locked classes. they're fun none the less and you'll get used to them!

For me, it was my first experience with a game like this. Mainly because it was 3D. :3 Don't judge me. Anyways, it was a beautiful game with fast and stylish combat as well as vivid characters and decent humour. I suggest you give it a try until the end. The main problems for me when playing is that, the game is quite slow and tedious. At the beginning, of course this shows the most but as you progress through, entering each area and doing each quest was indeed slow. It was worthwhile though because you were awarded with rewards. I still recommend this game for all ages.

It reminds me of Cube World which is one of my favorite games. I like the free roam fighting style and the feel of the  character moving around and evading attacks. Also, the game dosen't look that bad. It runs perfectly fine on my computer and looks pretty decent. Overall a grat game for being free. My only problem is that the characters are gender locked and that the weapons and the armor don't look that different as you progress. I'm not sure how different the armor looks as you get to the higher tiers of levels, but at the moment, they all seem to look the same.","April 11, 2014","true","7.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The storyline is amazing, and keeps you wanting to read most of the dialogue the characters have to offer, the many landscapes look beautiful, even with the old-school type graphics this game harbours. And, finally, the gameplay. It is the best aspect of this game so far, and it's what makes this game different from other MMORPGS. You feel like you're actually controlling your character; it isn't the same 'point and click' formula which has, unfortunately, taken control of most other MMORPGs of the era. Above all else, this game manages to be a unique, excellent experience which I am sure that you will all treasure.","June 20, 2014","true","284.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The graghics in this game are ok but what makes this game really stand out is the teh fact that even though there are only 5 or 6 classes you can have any mix you want, for instance you could be a healing class who is better at dps than healing or a tank that buffs the group, the options are almost unlimited for what role you can play.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/modestmayer/recommended/11610/","modestmayer","ZΦdiΔrK","http://steamcommunity.com/id/modestmayer/","328 products in account","First off- the most important thing is: the most fun I have had in a game since I was about ~12 (I'm 27, and i'm talking about FF7). The action in this game is... amazing. Fast paced, intense, and above all it's just fun.\n\nAlso, character progression is great. Each class specs into 2 different tiers, and from there 2 more, etc. This, combined with the fact that you can spend your points on different abilities, means you can have 2 people from the class performing different roles and adds uniqueness (kinda) and flexibility. Each new ability you unlock can be dramatic, and the best part is you can pump points into any of them depending on how you want to play your character. I hate when games have the useful skills and the useless ones, and it's just a no brainer.\n\nUnfortuantely (and this may have changed since i last played- let me know if it has) the in-game economy is set to nickel and dime you to death. I played up to level cap (when it was 50). Each new level they give you items to seal your good equip/items (thus allowing you to sell on the player2player market, otherwise your item is tied to your character). But as soon as you reach level cap, you get no more of these. This means, once you are out, as i was, you have to pay a ridiculous price for these seals. I can't remember what the price was, but it was ludicrous. There are free ones you collect in the game, but after playing for hours upon hours (i think my game time was arounf 172 hours?) i blew all of them and got maybe a few to work, if that. The rate of success on these free ones was so low, and the price of the paid ones so high, that it wasn't worth playing anymore because I essentially couldn't make a decent amount of money and i certainly didn't want to ditch my epic gear to an in game store for pennies. I sincerely hope that has changed since i stopped, but i doubt it has. Let me know though if it has, because i would LOVE to pick this game up again.\n\nAlso, i only dabbled in the PVP, but it was very good from what i played.\n\nIf this game had an option to buy it outright for a set price ($60? i would pay more even...) and just let you buy and sell freely in the market, maybe with some other options, it would be in my top 10 games ever, imho.\n\nAll in all, i would highly recommend playing this game- only with the foresight of knowing not to let yourself get addicted, only to have withdrawals when you force yourself off of it at level cap (when things get really interesting). Or maybe even play to level cap, and then start a new character.","February 24, 2014","true","197.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It reminds me of Guild Wars with the instance dungeons and I think it is nice you can go back to redo them at a higher level to challenge yourself or try it at the same level to get the best rating for better loot at the end. Cute graphics and the story that I have been following is interesting. My one complaint is I keep getting kicked off of it but I have afeeling that is more to do with my computer and connection.","March 1, 2014","true","5.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Starter classes branch into more elaborate and specialized paths that only enhance the enjoyment of the game. Although the game is based around instances/dungeons, the action and varied monsters make up for the lack of an open world. Can't seem to find any other game that deliver the same action as this game. The cutesy anime graphics may put off some potential players, but for those who do not mind the anime-like graphics will find this game enjoyable. Dungeons/instances are always more fun with friends, but solo play is still pretty fun to play through. A very recommended game for those who seek a true action MMO. ^_^","March 3, 2014","true","199.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Moves combo up with each other to give you a nice feeling that you're actually beating the crap out of what your fighting not like Skyrim when your attacks just pass through the enemy and it feels like your slicing through air. You can also feel how strong the bosses are when you see that they have no knockback at times due to their sometimes gigantic proportions. Each class you pick, they have a different role in the story line, I quite find this interesting and fun.","March 5, 2014","true","27.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The People who run the servers are the nicest bunch and ACTUALLY TAKE WHAT PEOPLE SAY AND WANT INTO CONSIDERATION, The game is based around personal improvment and makes you want to play it for longer.\n\nGrinding sounds pretty boring right? Well the fighting just feels so good that grinding isn't a chore!!! The only negative I have found in this game is the lack of flexibiltiy when it comes to gender choices because they are allready set with the class you choose. But gender doesn't really matter in this game.\n\nThe story is excellent and is easy to follow! No confusion, and doesn't even have to be done, great cut scenes and each character has an individial story and they all are connected to eachother (kinda like a puzzle).\n\nP.S. The fighting moves are great and also the PvP is smexy (there are no annoying-♥♥♥ factions)","March 6, 2014","true","128.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Hop on it.\n\nEdit: Okay, finally, time for an actual (really quick) review.\n\nDragon Nest is an Action-MMO (Aka, not your typical tab-target, spam F1-F5 MAX DPS ROTATION GOOOO WoW clone) with a fairly deep story, and decently done in game cinematics.\n\nIts a dungeon based 3d-beat-em-up meets MMO essentially. There are 6 characters, each with 2 subclasses, and then 2 more subclasses branching from those, and a 7th character (The Assassin) somewhere down the line coming.\n\nControls are pretty tight, and the game looks great. Each class has a large amount of varied skills, and you have the freedom to build the characters how you want (though, there are obviously prereqs for skills you may have to meet).\n\nNPCs are actually fun to talk to, and there's quite a large amount of dungeons in game.\n\nThose things being said, there are a few downsides, and I highly suggest you take them into consideration before you sink time (and money) into the game:\n\n1. While leveling, you'll find yourself making very long trips into town to talk to a bunch of really spread out npcs for questing reasons. Its tolerable in Lotus Marsh and the starter towns since they're pretty small, but its utterly atrocious in Saint's Haven, as its such a big place, and entering the castle counts as a map change. It drags the pace of the game down considerably at times.\n\n2. Its hosted by Nexon. For those of us familiar with them, I need not say more. For those who aren't, Nexon is a VERY greedy company, known for charging their players out the (insert word for butt here) for many things. While the game is free to play, you'll find yourself wanting avatars (armor that provides slight stat bonuses, but mainly exists for cosmetic reasons), and other things from their in-game shop. The prices in the shop for said avatars are misleading, as those are the prices for the shortest duration non-permanent version of the item. Instead, if you wish to keep things forever, you'll find yourself paying about 5 bucks per piece, which well, is a lot. Which is further compounded by the fact that NX items are not tradeable, so you can't just buy them off other people with in-game money outside of specific circumstances.\n\nThose two probems aside (pace-breaking quest gathering sequences that take up to 20 minutes sometimes), and overpriced cash shop items, its an extremely fun game gameplay-wise, and I'd suggest checking it out if you're looking for an actual game when you think of MMOs.","December 19, 2012","true","169.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The presence of a pay-to-win shop is not as prominent as other games (if vanity items like instant use potions could be considered pay-to-win), since personal skill is as important a factor in survival as your gears. Hack-and-slash veterans will feel comfortable fighting at difficulties higher than what the design recommends. Although the sound design might not be as sharp as AAA titles, it gets the job done and isn't a massive distraction, with character voicing appropriate for their personalities.\n\nIt's definitely worth trying.","January 27, 2014","true","7.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Go to Nexon's official website at http://dragonnest.nexon.net/ and download their client instead. The steam version is regularly plagued by log-in and patching issues and the only fix is to re-download the game every single time. Nexon and Steam doesn't seem to care about this version anymore.\n\nNow, on to the review! If you want action-oriented MMORPG with flashy / cool-looking moves then Dragon Nest is the game for you. You have your basic rpg classes in the form of Warrior, Archer, Cleric and Sorcerer. The other available classes are Tinkerer (a sort of engineer) and Dancer. Upcoming classes are Assassin and Lancer.\n\nThe world is instance type wherein areas (including towns) are separated like dungeons. Although, the towns are very big themselves. The dungeons get bigger and bigger as you progress into the game. Lastly, the environment details are well made and numerous.\n\nYou gain exp in the game by killing mobs in dungeons, clearing the dungeons themselves and completing NPC quests. When you gain a level you get skill points which you can use to unlock your skills. Core stats are pre-set by the game. Pretty much a standard level and skill system. There's a nifty feature wherein you can see a demo of a skill first before you get it. That way, you can see if you'll like the skill or not.\n\nExp is very fast from Level 1 to 50. 50 to 70 is when the grind starts but still doable and not boring because of the awesome combat system. If you're a hardcore player that can sit a whole day in front of a computer then you can get to the level cap in a week or so. If you're a casual player like me, at level 50 onwards you can gain 2 levels a day or 4 while still being able to stand up and do other stuff. That's pretty fast by today's MMORPG standards.\n\nI won't go into the other details of the game because to be honest, it's very big even though it's instanced type. I just provided feedback on the basic features that players tend to look forward to.\n\nSo again, if you're into action and flashy moves, this is the game for you. You're not really missing anything by not dowloading the Steam version so go the Nexon website I provided on this review and get their client instead. Trust me, it'll be less hassle in the long run.\n\nNexon Dragon Nest Official Website:\nhttp://dragonnest.nexon.net/","May 21, 2014","true","135.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you plan on getting the  decent  gear or that top pvp ladder spot you better be ready to grind those dungeons till your eyes bleed. It is very much a grind-to-win game. And is the very standard "Collect X amounts of stuff" MMO crap that we have come to enjoy (sarcasm). The story is mediocre at best. Customer support is quite possible one of the worst, as the publisher is Nexon.\n\nThat being said though, it still has it's great moments. If you just sit back and ignore all of those fancy collectables and pvp lags, you will realize that it can be enjoyable. The skills and classes are very diverse and offer a lot of interesting combos and techniques to play around with in both pvp and pve. The community (for the most part) is friendly and willing to help you if need be. And the variety of enemies the game throws at you keeps pve challenging and engaging.\n\n5.5/10 This game barely edges out on my scale. Do not play this game unless you like running the same dungeon repeatedly because you will not like it. However, if you are truly just in it for the experience and not the competitiveness, it can still be an entertaining game.","September 30, 2014","true","98.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Dragon Nest has a bit more of an RPG feel to it than Vindictus. The control is a bit different and resembles more like a mix of Vindictus and Guild Wars 2. However like other free online RPGs, its not really MMO, and its not very open world.  Missions are fun, but NPCs make you do them over and over. 4 character classes to choose from (again gender locked), Fighter(Male), Cleric,(Male) Archer(Elf fFemale), and sorceress (Female).  At upper levels you get class changes and take different class specializations.  Lots of fun, but you will tire of it if you play too much.","January 4, 2013","true","875.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But you can choose from 4 classes, each with their own unique abilities and strengths. So if you want a fun MMORPG, you should download this game and try it. Character design is pretty cool, the enemies can be a tad bit difficult, but hey what do you expect? for the enemies to stay at an easy level? lol, whats the fun in that , seriously.... But all in all you shoudl try this game, if you like MMORPG's. The only thing i dont like about this, well is that its llike Vindictus, meaning that you cant really free roam in this game, but oh well. Its a very good game if you like the MMORPG style like Vindictus, its very fun, and you can lose countless hours in it and not even realising it","March 21, 2013","true","10.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Its diverse fighting is one of the best little features in the game. Anime style graphics make this game look great. When your fighting you will definatley feel like you are breaking the earth. Only setbacks of this game is it is gender locked and that there isnt very much character customization. Sooner or later though NA (North America) will get more classes such as the Assassin which is Dragon Nests' biggest project at the minute. The Assassin is only available in its birth place, Korea, and is based on what his name is, an assassin. Very good game, despite those bad features the game looks great and is very fun and addicting.","April 4, 2014","true","38.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

And this one I absolutely fell in love with. It's got great gameplay (feels more like 3rd person action than an MMO, which I like) with some awesome abilities you can gain, a pretty good story that actually goes in depth, compared to some other MMO's I've played, and actually has some characters that you grow to care for. Not to mention that the style is very nice, along with the designs of most of the weapons and armor.\n\nThe ONLY issue I would have to say (but this could be said about other games as well), is that when you get to higher levels, like 45+, you will need to grind so much XP, it can be a bit teadious. But, if you have a group of friends, or can make some new ones on here, then you can go do some nice raids, and high level grinding, and that'll help out a bit. Otherwise, this game is pretty awesome, and I've enjoy every moment I've spent playing it.","July 7, 2014","true","102.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's been out for a few years but if you get into a nice guild the fun can really start, especially once you start forming friendships.

This game is highly recommended for people who have become jaded with the standard World of Warcraft clones out there. You can actually make real progress playing an hour at a time instead of having to organize a raid that takes 8-10 hours of nonstop game play.

It's geniunely plain entertaining, and pretty easy to get into, letting you enjoy the game without trying to sort out too much arcana or data dumps.  Game progression is also logical, so there's always something new to try out.  Stylistically the cartoony nature keeps it light, though there are elements of odd fanservice, seriousness, and irreverance that don't quite gel and seem odd.  However that's no reason not play what is honestly a good, fun, and rather precise game, wether you want to melt foes with fire, smash them with a sword, or just release a mechanical butler and a legion of roboducks.","February 27, 2013","true","40.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Dragon Nest has a wide variety of classes, each with stats that resemble that class which makes realistic gameplay. It also has a great levelling system, quest system, inventory and arena systems, alongside guilds, as well as parties with fair loot drops for its members. The varied weapons, gear and other items always gives you incentive to keep playing. With its fast action 3rd person gameplay, I would recommend this game to anyone who likes fast paced MMORPG's. This game breaks away from the top down MMO’s and does it well.

The whole "point at enemy, push button" aspect is not appealing to me. However, this MMO is different from what I'm used to seeing from them. This one uses a hack and slash mechanic and is quite fun! I actually can't wait to get my next skill, instead of being generally confused when I learn a new one in other MMOs. This games is generally geared for a younger audience, so there's not much to it intellectually, but the characters and quests are charming and at times extremely funny. The whole game has a generic anime feel to it, but if you like good, clean fun in a pretty environment you can't go wrong here.","October 5, 2014","true","38.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

That's when it was still growing here. This game due to verious reasons , one being it's art style , is what makes this game subjective to your taste. Some people played for a bit and wrote it off as unbalanced or child-like. Clearly not giving it much of a chance.\n\nFirst off it is in no way a pay-to-win.\nSecond I've never seen too many games where your level is NOT the main thing that matters , but skill. An example when i first started I had a guild carry me to level 24 . I then faced a level 10 in pvp and lost. He knew what he was doing unlike me.\n\nWith such a large variety or armour , sub-classes , and side-quest. It allows you to create and mold a unique powerful character to your liking. The story various character to character giving you more in-depth gameplay.\n\nMovement is fluid , fighting smooth. The game and the players never ceases to challenge you . You wont get bored unless you spoil it for your self. I mean that in a lot of ways. The fun in this game comes with the story, not knowing what new move you'll get next level, discovering new places, ccreating amazing weapons and armour, defining your character, and playing with the community. Ignore these things and trying to hard can ruin the experience of any mmo for you. Dont outcast yourself and just try and enjoy it.\n\nThe only con i can actually think of is , gender lock. A lot of people just left huh? Well if gender choice is a must have , still give it a shot. If you are not having fun by level 25 (if you followed the quest the right way and paced your self) then go ahead and drop it. However you will be missing out.\n\nLastly have fun. Some characters might not be for you, try something else. Try talking to people. Figure out how to fight. What moves work. Learn how to do and use things from certain quest. This game keeps you on your toes. Everything seems over whelming at first , but it is much simpler then you realize, and a lot more fun too.\n\nPersonal opinon. Your first class just go for it. learn from your mistakes. you can always make a second class and trust me , eatch class is different enough where it wont be tedious in anway to start over. Assassin has my favorite story. Warrior my favorite moves. Cleric is fun for parties. Archer is good in PvP . I could go on forever , I already kind of did lol","December 7, 2014","true","447.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The camera is third person so you always feel like your in the action, with movement being in the WASD, The free to play system is fair and does NOT really affect balance between players, i.e. pay to win situation. Most of your money goes into cosmetics anywa. Plus the game runs, and looks great! I do recommend that you play with friends and take on harder, but more rewarding challenges. A lot of fun is to be had with friends. The only thing that may be discouraging is that you can't choose the specific sex you want to play as for each class. So if you want to be a female, warrior-brute, sorry :/  I didn't have any big gripes with that though.

Beautiful in game art and cutscenes.  Some of the best writing, storylines, and NPC character development I have seen in forever. Immense in scope and pursuable quests. Clever crafting, character building, market system, and social interaction. Dragon Nest is an easter egg on Steam that it seems few people know about and part of me doesnt want to share, but the people who make this game possible should have their coffers lined with gold for such a well made excellently written and enjoyable game.\n\nSuggestion:\n1. Don't be afraid of challenging and even angering some players with impossible to beat quests.Abyss difficulty at any character level of play should be nigh impossible without a team no matter how good you, equipment, and teammates are.\nInscrutable difficulty wins respect, is the best pr, and get the most diehard loyal fans which this truly great game deserves in spades.\n\nLikers Like.

It recently got revamped to make leveling from 1-50 easier, although it will still take time.

Being a free to play, it has some pay elements like costumes, wings that boost movement speed, and harder to get costumes to get even more bonuses, HOWEVER you can buy all of this off of other, TRUSTED gamers with in game gold. It is incredibly easy to make gold in this game if you just try a bit. Combat is incredibly fun and relatively simple to get the hang of, but if you want to do any 4 man nests or 8 man raids right when they come out, i recomemd voice chat for organization and learning purposes. Trust me, makes life easy. The community is admitedly a little terrible due to some imbalances in the classes, but the developer, Eye, is working on these imbalances. I think in a year or 2 it will be evened out into dps-tier based classes. Classes with the least support having massive dps, classe with more support having lower overall dps,  but a massive Burst damage attack they can rely on to keep themselves keeping on. However, you can still find people who want to play against the meta, because honestly... Meta parties take almost no skill to run, and are all about deleting bosses. There are many good groups of players who wont descriminate, you just have to find them. Final note is RNG. It is EVIL. you could be well invested and all set to enhance your shiney new Unique item to +10, and burn through about 80$ worth of enhancement materials (buyable from other players mind you, about 8-10k gold worth) plus a couple thousand gold and end up with a +8 from degrades. However... you could also get to +12 without a single failure. RNG. its random. Luckily, this system will be improved at the current level cap, level 80 epic grade and above equipement will not downgrade until +8, and only one level if they do. Other issues with RNG are when you carry a scrub in a dungeon, they roll on the rare drop, win it, and run off. But hey, it is an mmorpg, thats expected. At least KSing isnt a thing. anyway, decide for yourselves. All games have flaws, but there is alot of fun in this game despite its flaws. find a good group to hang with, get gear, have fun.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nargubyte/recommended/11610/","nargubyte","Nargubyte","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nargubyte/","178 products in account","Before I get into this review, it's worth noting that there isn't much of a midway standpoint when it comes to Dragon Nest.  In other words, you either like it or you don't. That's not to say you shouldn't give it enough time to judge whether you want to keep playing or not, but really, for the most part, you either like it... or you don't.\n\nNow for starters, Dragon Nest is a free-to-play RPG. And this time, when I say free-to-play, I do mean it. One great thing about DN (Dragon Nest) is that you really can go through the entire game/an entire character and not spend a single penny. If you like the game however (and there's a good chance you do if you make it past level 30), you're likely going to end up spending a fair amount of money to make your character look fabulous. Besides the money aspect, DN is also an action MMO alongside it's RPG genre, and it has 'action oriented combat', meaning it's unlike the boring* point-and-click attack scheme most other MMOs have going for them. It's fast paced, and when you get used to it, you'll find yourself pulling off ridiculous arrays of relentless combos without even thinking about it.\n\nDragon Nest currently has nine classes (one of which is currently limited to a 1-month creation period), each of which branch into two unique sub-classes, of which branch into two final sub-classes as well, excluding the Lancea class (which only has one first spec) and the new 'Dark' Class, which is a linear path. For the most part, each class handles very differently from one another, (the exception being not the playstyle itself but rather the roles each class takes on e.g. dps, tank, or healer), and each class also has a unique set of skills that the player can string together to form combos.\n\nNow to get into the meat of the game: the combat. The combat in DN is exceptional for most MMOs out there... in a specific way. Now what I mean by that can be taken a few different ways, so allow me to explain. Whereas Warframe's combat is rewarding in it's smoothness and executability, Dragon Nest's combat is rewarding due to it's magnitude. This still sounds strange, but think of it this way: there is no class that is not a hard-hitting class. In Dragon Nest, every class has at least several obsurdly powerful abilities. Powerful in size, not damage. In PvE, you find yourself facing waves of enemies rather than groups of two or three, and this is countered by the insane AoE abilities Dragon Nest has to offer. Rather than swinging your sword back and forth a few times to hit an enemy in front of you, you swing it once, and it sends a shockwave of dust at your enemies causing them to fly backwards and die. In DN, it's quantity combat. That's the best way to put it.\n\nFinally, I'll mention PvP - since it's a large aspect of the game for many players - even though my knowledge on it is limited. The PvP in Dragon Nest is incredibly fast-paced. Seriously. If you're against a skilled Windwalker, good luck and good bye. Now that's not to say DN's PvP is unfair, because it most certainly is not. The PvP system uses percentiles, so even when facing higher-level opponents (aside from the amount of abilities unlocked) it remains fair and balanced. Again, my knowledge on this particular aspect of the game remains limited, since I avoid PvP, but if you want a hint (pick Assassin for PvP it's nuts).\n\nOverall, I'd just say give DN a shot. I loaded up the game several months ago half-expecting an unfinished pile of laughable potatos, but what I got was less laughs and more gasps as I slowly discovered the charm that is Dragon Nest. To reiderate, just give it a try. You'll know if you like it or if you don't. And on the offchance you do, I'll see you there.\n\n\n*PERSONAL OPINION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(And I swear if the second spec for Lancea isn't a Scythe wielding class I'm going to replace my hardrive with a potato)\n\nI am now running my PC off approximately 3.5 volts of potato juice","August 5, 2014","true","901.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Honestly, when I first saw it, I thought it was going to be like all of the other MMORPGs. Basic few classes, leveling, lack of people, and then get bored maybe a week or two into it, but I have been playing for over a year now, and I think it's awesome. There are not only 7 different classes with another on the way to choose from, but each class gets a subclass at level 15, and then it splits yet again into more customization at level 45. There is no lack of players, either. There are multiple channels filled with players in all of the different cities. Party play is fun and the dungeons are expansive. I absolutely recommend this game to the MMO players out there. If you've ever played Vindictus, it has a similiar game-play, but a bit more anime-esque.

This still sounds strange, but think of it this way: there is no class that is not a hard-hitting class. In Dragon Nest, every class has at least several obsurdly powerful abilities. Powerful in size, not damage. In PvE, you find yourself facing waves of enemies rather than groups of two or three, and this is countered by the insane AoE abilities Dragon Nest has to offer. Rather than swinging your sword back and forth a few times to hit an enemy in front of you, you swing it once, and it sends a shockwave of dust at your enemies causing them to fly backwards and die. In DN, it's quantity combat. That's the best way to put it.\n\nFinally, I'll mention PvP - since it's a large aspect of the game for many players - even though my knowledge on it is limited. The PvP in Dragon Nest is incredibly fast-paced. Seriously. If you're against a skilled Windwalker, good luck and good bye. Now that's not to say DN's PvP is unfair, because it most certainly is not. The PvP system uses percentiles, so even when facing higher-level opponents (aside from the amount of abilities unlocked) it remains fair and balanced. Again, my knowledge on this particular aspect of the game remains limited, since I avoid PvP, but if you want a hint (pick Assassin for PvP it's nuts).\n\nOverall, I'd just say give DN a shot. I loaded up the game several months ago half-expecting an unfinished pile of laughable potatos, but what I got was less laughs and more gasps as I slowly discovered the charm that is Dragon Nest. To reiderate, just give it a try. You'll know if you like it or if you don't. And on the offchance you do, I'll see you there.\n\n\n*PERSONAL OPINION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(And I swear if the second spec for Lancea isn't a Scythe wielding class I'm going to replace my hardrive with a potato)\n\nI am now running my PC off approximately 3.5 volts of potato juice","August 5, 2014","true","901.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Dragon Nest is a game made by Nexon and, what I would call, like Vindictus' younger brother. The combat is very involved as compared to other MMORPG's and skills are very satisfying to use. All-in-all, I would say Dragon Nest is a very fun MMORPG and if you like Vindictus, you will most likely enjoy this game.\n\nPros:\n- Cutesy Anime Style (Maybe a con if you're not into that?)\n- Runs fairly well\n- Satisfying/Solid Combat\n- Straight-forward and easy to understand\n- Not Pay-to-win (Last I checked anyway...)\n- Has the general quality one can expect from a Nexon game\n\nCons:\n- Progress slows down rather significantly around level 40\n- Difficult to gear-up later on\n- PvP is incredibly broken\n\nThe bottom line is, I haven't really had any bad experiences with Dragon Nest, and it's F2P, so why not give it a try?","April 16, 2014","true","102.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I mean the towns you can see players by joining different channels etc, but to actually participate with others in quests and what-not you have to party with them. That just takes too much out of an MMORPG for me. In my opinion it's actually NOT an MMO.

The graphics are on par with PS2 B-grade titles, but the game still stutters like crazy due to the Tera / Zelda style realtime action combat.  The worst part of the game are the zones.  They're as big as a closet and you're required to battle about ~25 enemies at once.  There is no room to manuever or do anything other than spam buttons ala God of War.  While you hit one enemy there are three flanking you from the sides and rear.  It feels like a single player game instead of an MMO because up to level 10 I saw maybe two other players the entire night.  The quests are lame and non inspiring with awful translations of the original "humor," just like every other crappy Korean mass produced MMO.  For a newbie to MMOs it might not be not bad, but anyone that's played an RPG or MMO that wasn't made over 10 years ago on a modern computer will just roll their eyes and uninstall after 15 minutes.","September 8, 2014","false","6.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

The combat system is along the lines of Kingdoms of Amalur (with flashier skills) with a 4 player Co-op dungeon system added into it. It also has a branching job advancement system where you choose your path of skill development depending on your preferences. The game started with 4 classes: Warrior, Mage, Archer, and Priest, Since the 2 more classes have been added: Alchemist and Dancer. The Thief/Assassin is currently in Korea and on its way to the US soon. I'm sure more classes will be available for years to come. I suggest you watch this video " http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRRj-av5lTY " to see the  way skills look in the game. Everyone has their preferences, but I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TO ACTION RPG FANS LOOKING FOR SOME FUN CO-OP OR SINGLEPLAYER ACTION!

Before you say I haven't played it, I've played 200+ hours from their website, not through steam.\n\nThe combat system is excellent, It's modestly free to play, (the one exception is mounts, it's like 40$ for a chance to get one, but mounts have miniscule use. Trust me.) Dragon nest is an extremely immersive game. The classes are all very fun, and pretty balanced. The only downside is, content updates are rare, being a asian game, we get patches 1/2 YEARS later.\n\nImportant things to note about dragon nest.\n\nThe entire game is balanced around PvE, this doesn't mean the PvP is utter ♥♥♥♥, but it's not as good as it could be. Most classes are way stronger in PvP then PvE (namely Kali.). The PvE is 100% instance based. Not once will you find a mob that isn't in an instance.\n\nMy honest opinion ratings:\n\nCombat (overall): 9.5/10\nPvE: 9/10\nPvP: 8/10\nP2W (pay to win 1 being very much so, 10 being not at all): 8/10\nGraphically: 5/10 (the game really lacks in this. The ♥♥♥♥♥iest of laptops can run this game fine.)\nOverall: 8/10\nBottom line is, this game should not be overlooked.

Pretty much run around towns trying to find Rose, supposedly a girl who has the power of the "Ancients. "\n\nAlso can lead into a grinding fest if you don't reach the level requirement of a quest, then your only hope is to do plenty of sidequests. Mainly the quest that will have you grind is going to Saint's Haven which requires you to have a level of 25 I believe, I can't remember.\n\nThe combat system is really fun and doesn't get as repetitive as most games do. But a dissapoint in gender-locked classes. Most classes in this game you would see in any other MMORPG excluding Kali, don't bash me about tinkerer because it's pretty much a ranged shooting class.\n\nDownside is the community support, which I'm pretty sure we're not surprised because it was developed by Nexon.\n\nOver all, I find this game pretty fun and you can get into quite easily. But I don't encourage you to spend actual money to buy stuff off the website.\n\n8.5/10","May 27, 2014","true","55.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

But not the kind of game I will spend time in.\n\nI did nto get far.  At all.  Between the cutesy art and giant boobs, or the rediculously basic tutorial, I can see that the game is not meant for me, a 30+ year old gamer who wants to be challanged and have skilled paly rewarded.\n\nWhat thres me off the game:  Extremely limited range, on "Ranged" characters.  Also, (might be chagable, I did not attempt to fix) the camera aims your spells/attacks.  Meanig you have to look at the badguy you want to hit.  Not a bad thign right?  Except it meant it I was constantly shooting at things feet because I did wanted to keepa  good veiw of the game as well.  But you effectively have to choose between aiming and seeing from a decent angle.\n\nYou start out weak I get that.  I'm sure the game gets better.  That's the nature of MMO's.  For all I know 5 minutes further down the road it gets less bland,   But the beginning skills for the 4 classes I tried, were rediculously boring and uninspired conpared to the very interesting skill videos showed off at character creation.  And I don't want another "grind through the boring ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t in hopes of to getting to the good stuff" game.  I have enough other games that are fun from the get go to choose from.\n\nNot a bad game, but no pull to entice the player past the tutorial that teaches you how to push the spacebar.  But it just gives no reason to play it over other games.","November 8, 2014","false","1.8"," 9 of 21 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","9","21","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ryansanguine/recommended/11610/","ryansanguine","Ryan Sanguine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ryansanguine/","79 products in account","Dragon Nest:\n\nMuch like the latest Folger's commercial, Dragon Nest doesn't seek to surpass the typical MMO, it looks to land right where every single other one has already innovated, and in most cases, the others have done so in much more engaging and profound ways.  In fact, Dragon Nest doesn't tread any new ground what-so-ever.\n\nPrepare for another... Umm... Adventure?  Dragon Nest features a tired storyline that never engages the player, character classes and progressions you've seen for the last decade (or two), an uninspired crafting and upgrade system that's been done to death by every j/k-RPG on the market, and an overpriced cash shop that attempts to lure you in with functions that remove many of the, simply put, intentional annoyances of trying to play the game, such as pitifully limited inventory space and automatic loot pickups.\n\nGameplay is nearly completely combat-based, with drawn-out town segments featuring quest gathering and loot selling.  Combat fails to innovate; expect keyboard gymnastics and mouse-flinging typical of this genre, often interrupted by loading screens every few minutes.  Seriously... The loading screens destroy any immersion to be had here.\n\nI would dare to say that the game features some unique artwork and a handful of beautifully modelled monsters and characters, but most of the game centers around scantily-clad female characters (because that's what appeals to the typical gamer, right guys?) which you are introduced to immediately during the game's first loading screen, and 'emo' androgenous males that have left their "provocative" stink on every RPG from the east since Square-Enix.\n\nMusic and sound effects are nothing worth mentioning; I was mostly annoyed by the droning music clips that are featured and muted it within an hour of my playtime.  Sound effects are cartoonish and repetitive, and their lack of variety becomes painfully apparent during combat.  It should be no surprise that the voice acting featured in the game is top-notch, cream-of the-crop, steaming garbage-on-a-hot-summer-day that always sounds completely out of context; how these voice actors are cast or maintain careers is completely lost on me.\n\nThe story begins with you being some ho-hum walking randomly through the wilderness, and two little girls are attacked by orcs, one being some oracle that you're desperately trying to save for eons, yet every single time you get close, you feel like you should see "Sorry Mario, but the princess is being held in another castle!"  Oh, and there are evil dragons, apparently.  Most NPC dialogue seems to assume you know what's going on in this world, but the game doesn't ever make an earnest attempt at introducing any of the lore to you so that you know what the hell is going on.\n\nOverall, Dragon Nest is a mediocre game; it doesn't innovate in any area, and it's formula is tried and true.  It may be free-to-play, but it makes every possible attempt to make you open your wallet to essentially unbreak itself.  Being a Nexon game, expect their lovely gem 'HackShield' to break and crash your game on a near-hourly basis, often throwing false-positives or simply having some kind of failure that will cause you to lose your progress mid-dungeon.\n\n3 / 10","June 6, 2014","false","11.9"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","14"

(could be a positive aspect for some people, I personally just wanted to play and try the gameplay before getting into the side story)\n- Not a lot of explanation about how to regroup or join friends that aren't at the same starting point as you. (Comes when you can meet, but you have to play 3-4 instances before you can really join.\n\nSimply not a game for me. It was over hyped by the community and compared to Vindictus in term of action. I can affirm there is no ressemblance. It is was more mechanical than its Nexon's related.","November 5, 2014","false","1.4"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

Also you don't even need to read the npc text just watching the cutscenes will give you the facts about what going on in the story. There tons of dungeons and pvp arena's. This is one of the best nexon games out there. The download is fast and the controls are easy to use. Theres tons of people to meet.

The anti-hack crap doesn't always load and therefore the game then also doesn't load. The game sometimes takes forever to launch, one time taking me over a half hour.\n\nUntil these bugs are fixed, this game can only earn a 2/10 in overall. Honestly a 9/10 in appearance and a 7/10 in gameplay. The 2/10 has the extra 1 point due to the fact the Kali class dances like a dirty stripper, which i eternally love to the ends of the earth.\n\nWithout that one thing... this game would be stuck at 1/10 for me.","December 18, 2013","true","9.8"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

COming from vindictus this game seem like a childs game but in the long run has great pvp system. The controls are very responsive and has great comabt mechanics. The community is very helpful and enjoys running things together. Raids are a challange and you can find yourself face down in the dirt real quick. If you are a fan of any action mmo then you should try out dragon nest. They have introduced the new assassin class which is super bad ♥♥♥, you want crazy dps all I have to say is shinobi.\n\nPros: great community, awesome pve, great mechanics and great anime style graphics, Dont need a top end pc, crazy good pvp including more then one pvp mode, not an over priced store.\n\nCons: Grind fest which can lead to a headache, nexon customer service(have better luck in forums). SInce it is free to play there are outfits which boost stats (they do have free offers to do for currency), so you can consider this slighty pay to win( in pvp) but i have seen people whip ♥♥♥ a free to play.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vaagur/recommended/11610/","vaagur","Vaagur","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vaagur/","2091 products in account","Dragon Nest is a typical free-to-play MMORPG that you can play solo or with partying with friends. It doesn't offer anything really special compared to other MMOs and it is extremely casual.\n\nThe graphics are alright and the music is pretty good, the gameplay is fluid... But, that's far from being the issue i'm having with this game. Pay-to-win usually is, you know, somewhat bad and it makes you stronger than players who don't pay or it takes longer to achieve a certain level of power... But in Dragon Nest it's an entirely new story.\n\nI started a new character and I was questing with a friends, Monsters took about 3-4 hits each and using spells usually one or two shotted them, you know, pretty standard... Until we earned NX gear from our "Reward Chest" at around level 9 (you obtain one of those everytime you level up). It was a full set of NX (paid) gear that lasts 7 days. Now, the monsters I was fighting at around this level had about 50 health maybe... And I was hitting around 10-15 damage with my basic attacks.\n\nWell, after I equiped the gear, I was hitting around 4000 with my basic attacks and the monsters were just as weak as before! So for the next few levels, I was 1 hitting everything, including bosses with my basic attack... How fun!\n\nAlso, in your "Reward Chest" you can find "Goddess's Laments". They're used to craft armour, weapons and jewelry... But, they have only implemented armour and weapons for the older classes or something, because if you play a Machina, you can only craft jewelry with those crafting materials and nothing else!\n\nAnother thing, if you have played this game before and you want to play it on Steam, you can never get the Steam exclusive mount, because you need a fresh account to obtain it.\n\nOverall, the game is way too easy, anyone could play it with the paid gear you are given and you get it every few levels it seems. I wouldn't bother playing such a game.","April 29","false","7.6"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","5","14","0","0"

I had the highest graphics and didn't lose a frame, but it looked like ♥♥♥♥. I am now going to uninstall the game and whoever looks at this, understands you should not get this game nor buy anything in it. I am not gonna reccomend this to my friends and also another thing.. Maybe you should have a better layour because I CANT FIND A DAMN THING THE IN TOWN WHERE YOUR SUPPOST TO FIND STUFF. I LOOKED ALL OVER AND FOUND NO SHOP OR ANYTHING. Heres a little tip, MAYBE PUT THE ACTION OF THE NPC ABOVE IT. And another thing, who the hell makes your characters, the girls are ugly and the guys LOOK LIKE GIRLS. I hope you change my mind.....","March 18, 2015","false","0.8"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

Is this game worth playintg, sure.. why not.. its fast paced, easy controls, fun gameplay. I mean for free it dont get much better then that. Of course you have the option to buy items in store, but i have not really taken the time to look into their store since there is not much of a community playing the game, so i rather not put any money into buying any cool items from their store as i would see it as a waste.\n\nI do recommend this game if you are bored and looking for something to pass the time for a couple weeks while you wait for your next game to be released or something like that.\n\nI will definitly be watching out for a part 2 of this game if it ever comes out, hopefully it will full the community.","July 31, 2014","true","3.8"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"
