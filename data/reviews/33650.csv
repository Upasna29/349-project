"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shikono/recommended/33650/","shikono","Elfee","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shikono/","382 products in account","Puzzler world is like a puzzle magazine from a kiosk but you can make 3 different profiles, so also other family members can play the game with an own profile (or you try the puzzles in an other language) and of course you have way more puzzles than the most magazines have.\n\nVariety:\nThere are different types of puzzles, for example Wordsearch, Sudoku, Fitword, Silhouette, Spot the difference, Crossword, Code word, Hangman and so on. In the challenge mode you can play 560 main puzzles and always when you solved one you are able to play an other mini puzzle. So the amount of puzzles in this mode is 1.120. There is also a Quickplaymode but the puzzles in this mode are so easy that you very probably won‘t play it. Anyways for so many puzzles I give 10/10 points because the most puzzle magazines have like 100-200 puzzles.\n\nLanguages & Orthography:\nThe possible languages which you can choose are: American English, British English, German, Spanish, French and Italian. Of course this is a great selection but maybe they should add also Russian and I can’t give the full points because there are sometimes little spelling mistakes in the game, e. g. I have had a hangman puzzle where I had to search a „panet“ (correct word would be planet) and the result was „merker“ but the planet is called in German „Merkur“ (english = Mercury). Such mistakes are really rare and don’t disturb the game too much so I can give for the languages and ortography 8/10 points.\n\nGraphic:\nThe graphic is simple. What else? You can’t expect that much from a puzzle game and it’s adequate for some minutes playing puzzles. For the people who want to make all the achievements as fast as they can, I give the adivce to make some breaks between. You don’t have the highest resolution in this game so if you play it for hours you maybe get stinging eyes or a headache. My points: 5/10\n\nControls:\nThe controls are really easy. You can use the keyboard or you click on the letters with your mouse. There is also a handwriting recognition function. 10/10\n\nLevel of difficulty:\nSome of the puzzles are really easy, some are normal. Sometimes you need a bit time to get the solution but it won’t break you if you are into such puzzles. Sadly there is no option to change the level of difficulty. ;(\n\nAchievements:\nThere are 15 achievements which you get easily. No bugged ones. The only con is that there are no leaderboards.\n\nPrice: The normal price for this game is 4,99 €. For so many puzzles this price is okay but I advise to buy the game on a sale. I bought it at Steam Summer Sale for 0,79 € (valuta calculator says: 1,08 Dollar ^^) and for this price I am really happy with this game.","July 14, 2014","true","11.1"," 47 of 47 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","47","47","0","14"

What the game gives you that the magazine does not are of useful hints when you need them, but only if you have enough hint tokens that are earned through completing puzzles. You also get way more puzzles than would fit in a magazine and if you pick it up on sale it will cost less than one too.\n\nIf you are expecting an innovative masterpiece that will challenge you then you can give this a pass, if you want something to waste a few minutes now and then to keep your mind engaged then I can recommend this game to you.","December 23, 2014","true","4.6"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","21","22","2","0"

There is support for multiple languages, treating British and American English as two different languages - and they should, for a game like this. I accidentally tried the British one at first and had a terrible time at the crossword. Then I switched to American and the crossword got MUCH easier. If you're not worried about full completion of the game, you can skip as far ahead as you want - all content is open right from the start of the challenge mode. And there is a lot of content - over 1200 puzzles in total.\n\nCons: The difficulty progression is very slow. In the beginning, the puzzles are tediously easy. Hardcore puzzlers will be a bit annoyed at having to slog through the beginning, before the puzzles get hard enough to be really interesting. The proper order of operations is not followed in the "equate" bonus puzzles (they don't do multiplication/division before addition/subtraction like they should), but this is easy enough to get used to. The silhouette "puzzles" are really not puzzles at all. Switching languages means you have to start the whole challenge mode over. Puzzles are not randomly generated and once you've solved one, there is no replay value. Too many hint tokens are given, removing some of the challenge from harder puzzles.\n\nThis game is particularly well-suited to younger puzzlers, since the slow increase in difficulty and ease of the starting puzzles make it very comfortable to get started and train your logic brain. However, I don't regret my purchase, despite the tedious easy beginning of the game. I've spent a few fun hours on it and I look forward to a quick crossword or link-a-pix each morning to get my brain started.","December 17, 2013","true","10.6"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

I prefer my puzzles with the exception of Crosswords to be Hard/Expert level, but I can still enjoy a puzzle if it ranges anywhere from Easy thru to Expert.  Thus I was able to complete all 1120 of them and due to that I give it a thumbs up.\n\nTo illustrate just how Easy some of them are:    Hangman -   7 letter Word (English) with the clue "Day of the Week".  Pretty hard to miss that one.  If it was an isolated instance I wouldn't comment, but the WordFit and the Hangman are beyond easy.  Those two types of puzzle get "epic fail" as they're well beyond easy.  The rest are enjoyable enough.\n\nBuy it on sale.

Some of them are easier, some are harder - but you can acess half of them at any point. Second half are bonus challenges, paired with regular ones. You unlock them by completing first one from the pair.\nThere are 14 challenges, like crosswords, spot the diffrence, wordsearches, hangman ect. It may seem boring, but completing it is both fun, and challenge.\nAfter each game (both regular and bonus), you pick a present. It may contain a hint, or a letter (7 of them grant you with around 100 hints). Hints are aviable only in regular challenges, and they provide a bit of help when you need it. They are divided into 3 groups: 5, 10 and 20. The more expensive the set is, the bigger is help, and effects vary in diffrent challenges.\nNot much more is possible to be said - it looks a bit like childs game at the beggining, but it's actually quite a nice game.\nIf you like achievements - this is a perfect game. It takes less than 6 hours to get all of them here, as there are only achievements for completing 10 of each challenge, and nothing for having 100% of the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/osagemorgan/recommended/33650/","osagemorgan","Osage Morgan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/osagemorgan/","551 products in account","It's a reasonably fun diversion, but there are a few things that make it so that I can't recommend it. First and foremost being that it's not too hard to find puzzles of a similar ilk online for free -- and often with better interfaces. (Just compare the Link-a-Pix in the game to the same found on Conceptis's own website.)  The second problem is that some of the games aren't really puzzles per se... showing the user a picture and asking them to memorize it for three questions isn't a puzzle, it's just a memory test. It's not a puzzle unless one has to puzzle something out. Memorization is just an irritation. There's also a staggering difference in apparent audience between puzzles; the Codeword puzzle is clearly meant for advanced puzzlers, while Silhouette is obviously set for the grade school crowd, but they're all mixed in together.\n\nFinally, though it's a minor element, it bothers me quite a bit that the Equate "puzzles" don't follow the proper order of operations. The only thing worse than a puzzle that's stupidly simple is one that's only challenging because the desired answer is actually wrong.","May 13, 2014","false","58.4"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

There are so many FANTASTIC puzzles to choose from and the prizes are unbelievable! This game should be a $60 game because of how deep the campaign mode really gets, and how immersive the game is when your playing it. There is absolutely nothing bad to say about Puzzler World and it should be IGN's #1 game of All-Time. There has never been a game that has made me cry when the campaign ended but this did, [SPOILER ALERT] the fact that Jacob Giancola (the main character) overcomes his addiction to link-a-pix and defeats the evil dragon puzzle was just truly astounding. The way the final cutscene looked was better than watching it happen if it was in real life. There will never be a game so memorable than Puzzler World, besides of course Puzzler World 2 which brings back Christo♥♥♥♥ingidiot to life after he dies in the crossword puzzle section of the first game. I reccomend this game to anyone who loves a very interesting story mode, UNREAL graphics, and perfect controls and gameplay. I give Puzzler World 8/8 m8 and I would indeed play this entire game all over again. There will never be any game created that is as good as this masterpiece, not even Call of Duty.

Asking for thumbs down, that's what.\n\nExistential issues aside, the other reasons not to buy this:  The interface isn't really aimed at PC, you can't change the resolution (although it does have a handy handwriting recognition capability, because presumably the developers didn't know about keyboards).

But for sure, puzzle wasn't done good for a selection of over 1200 puzzles, it's just many many pages of puzzle selection tiles, fitting in 4x4 square.\n\nIt also gives you hints points after solcing a puzzle, which is randomly determinated. All done with a fake choice feeling due to it giving you three present boxes to choose, but it's all random anyway, so yes. Then you can use hints during the puzzle for help, like me not being able to solve a single crossword by myself.\n\nAnd well, since some people like different puzzles, at least it does one thing good - allows you to choose any puzzle from all selection. Aside from another half of puzzle types puzzles that you only after solving one main puzzle. So, not so nice, actually.\n\nActually, it's hard to review it, it's just collection of various games. It's OK. It does things, gives you fun of types you want and is a bit clumpsy. Also, no awesome music. Shame.\n\nAs for me, I am there only for Link-A-Pix puzzles.","April 22, 2015","true","23.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Nothing too fancy and you can turn off the music (thank goodness).  At $.49 this is a no brainer.\n\nEdit: Now that I have played this game for a while I thought I'd add a few thoughts.  The puzzles really are quite simple and the gameplay gets...lackluster...after a while.  I don't think I'd pay more than I did for the game but it does allow for just a quick gaming session when I feel like it.\n\nOne thing that really annoys me is that the game starts with the music on.  You have to go through the user selection before the options actually are set.  I always hit the mute button before starting the game just so I don't have to listen to it.","February 2, 2015","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Saw that "Puzzler World" is for sale at 49 cents and it was a must buy, lol. That's a very nice deal that I got. Why? - you may ask. Well, there are 8 puzzle types and over 1100 different puzzles in Challenge Mode. If you got stuck at solving a puzzle you can use hint tokens. You earn them by completing puzzles. I used a lot of those for crosswords as I am not very good at them. Really fun game and if you can get it at this price it's a steal. For real. Got 100% achievements in 8 hours but might play more. I usually don't play games that I already "completed" (earned 100% achievements) but I can do an exception for this one. :P Also, I noticed that there is a sequel and it's also worth 49 cents. Damn, I feel so lucky. :D I used to solve such puzzles in a notebook when I am not on the PC but now I can do that in these games. And let's be serious - you can't even buy a newspaper with a crossword for this price. So, my point is that if you like puzzles you'd love "Puzzler World".
