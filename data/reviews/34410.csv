"http://steamcommunity.com/id/4887247/recommended/34410/","4887247","47","http://steamcommunity.com/id/4887247/","115 products in account","Death to Spies: Moment of Truth is a WWII-era stealth game in which you play as a Russian agent named Semion Strogov, a man tasked with eliminating espionage-related threats to the Soviet Union. The missions that you must accomplish range anywhere from gathering intel to assassination, with the locations in which you will be inserted range from German military camps to an English hospital. The areas are varied, and you never feel like the developers ran out of ideas.\n\nThe gameplay of Death to Spies is very similar to the Hitman games, with most of the stealth revolving around disguises. While crawling through bushes and vents are a viable way to play the game, using the game's disguise system is the most reliable way to play. The disguise system in this game is usually pretty realistic, and the AI is consistent when it comes to detecting you (I'm looking at you, Hitman 2 Japan levels), so you always know why your disguise did not work, and what you can do to improve it. Certain disguises don't work in certain areas, and if you take the clothes of a high-ranking officer, the guards will recognize that you aren't the person you claim to be. Adding to that, in the higher difficulty settings, blood-stained clothes and clothes with bullet holes are unusable, so stabbing and shooting is a no-no. Much more reliable weapons are the garrotte and chloroform if you prefer a non-lethal approach. The game doesn't seem to punish you for taking the lethal approach (as long as you are merciful to civilians), unlike many other stealth games out there.\n\nI can't speak much for the graphics of the game, since it doesn't seem to like my graphics card, washing out all the colors. This made the game look like an old movie, which in my opinion added to the atmosphere. The animations are nothing special, but they do their job and you can always tell what's going on. The music was mostly forgettable, but it always fits what's going on.\n\nOne thing I did not mention earlier is that this game is very difficult, and the poor shooting mechanics don't do anything to help it. Unfortunately, there's no tutorial in this game, so some of the more nuanced parts of the game must be learned through experience. I personally enjoy when games give me a challenge and didn't mind the lack of a tutorial that much. As for the shooting mechanics, this is a stealth game, so you shouldn't be shooting much anways. This game really shines when you're walking down the corridor of a German military base, doing your best to remain inconspicuous.\n\nThe thing that really sets this game apart from other games in this genre, and indeed, from other games period, is the amount of realism in this game. As I said earlier, if you stab people or shoot people, it renders their disguise useless, and people may recognize you if you take a unique disguise anyways. One of the options in the game is to make everyone speak their native language, adding to the atmosphere. Being a German speaker really helped me here, as most of the enemies in this game are German, and certain small hints can be drawn from their chatter. Strogov himself is, obviously, a Russian speaker, making all of the briefings and cutscenes in Russian with English subtitles. Death to Spies itself was a Soviet anti-espionage program during WWII, which I did not know originally.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed Death to Spies: Moment of Truth. People calling it a rip-off of Hitman obviously didn't see the game for what it is: a realistic spy game set during WWII. A disguise system and assassination missions don't make a game a Hitman clone. Though the story is mostly nonexistent, and the game's soundtrack is mostly forgettable, Death to Spies: Moment of Truth is a fun stealth game that, as long as they iron out some of the wrinkles in (hopefully) future installments, could become one of my favorite games. This game is a definite recommendation, as long as you don't mind a difficult game.","May 24, 2014","true","15.5"," 61 of 65 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","61","65","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chapston/recommended/34410/","Chapston","Chapston","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chapston/","90 products in account","If you like the Hitman series, have an interest in espionage or WW2 this game is for you. It is a bit dated now, and you can see this by the graphics and the UI however that doesn't harm the game in anyway as even now it is very playable.\n\nWEAPONS\n\nThe first reason I liked this game was the detail in terms of authenticity and gameplay. There is a large amount of historically accurate 'spy' weapons availiable including a Nagant silenced revolver and the classic silenced sten gun however if you are looking for a shooter this is not for you. Most of the weapons feel fairly weak - mostly because they are silenced but even the machine guns feel a bit 'odd' for example the STG 44 doesn't sound right and doesn't give a real kickback it should do, by affecting you physically, it instead just seems to tilt up when you fire. The guns are hardly the main meat of the game but for an authentic game such as this they could have done better.\n\nVEHICLES!\n\nMoving onto a positive note there are vehicles in the game, and correct me if i am wrong, but i do not think hitman or any other simular stealth games include the ability to drive vehicles whilst useing them as a tool to hide bodies or escape. Sure they don't drive very well but it is not a racing game and they are slow, but it is nice to have the option to hide a german officers corpse in the back of your bad-♥♥♥ opel blitz.\n\nAI\n\nThe AI is competant at what it does, the detection system is good - the sense bullet noises, if you are near them or in their line of sight and yet still allows you to use morphine or take out a guard from behind. There is always problems though-AI can be a bit stupid sometimes by repeatably charging into a room you are camping in whilst you gun 20 of them down, you cannot just walse through missions like this though as in the end they will pull back and wait for you, or 'lob' a grenade into your hiding spot.\n\nSTEALTH/TOOLS\n\nThe main component of any game of this genre is stealth i.e the ability to have to avoid, usually enemies, without being noticed. In Death to Spies moment of truth there is a variet of ways to do this...\n\nYou can go in quiet using morphine, silenced weapons, diversions and patience to outwit the enemy or you can play it on easy and run-and-gun, but the latter doesn't work often and why would you want to anyway? The stealth is statisfying but you don't have the ability to do much in the way of interesting tactics. The interactions you are given throughout missions are good but they can be hard to find sometime, I spent ages trying to work out how to get passed a party of german officers only to find that the plumbing had to the solution.\n\nGood points:\n\n-A Completely solid game, I have had no problems with running it and the aesthetic and the gameplay complement each other perfectly (although the art direction is nothing to write home about- but the normal 'trying for realism' graphics suite it well).\n\n- Authentic levels, objectives, weapons, uniform (there is disguises in the game).\n\n-Up to you in how you complete the mission, big level design with choices of which way to go and what you do and (I think) sometimes even say.\n\nBad points:\n\n-Lack of direction, doesn't really tell you the options you have to complete missions, and figuring it out as you go along on harder difficulties ends in death.\n\n-Boring mission objectives (Blow A up, kill B officer, find C secret documents - very cliche)\n\n-Bad gunplay\n\nOverall I had some fun with it, I would recommend it if you are remotely interested in this period of history (late WW2, early cold war), stealth games or simply a challenge (saboteur mode is hard - no disguises).\n\nIf you would like to learn more about this game message me on steam or if you have any possible ideas or improvements I could make to my reviews also message me.","November 27, 2013","true","10.5"," 46 of 48 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","46","48","0","2"

You are a russian agent operating behind German lines and accomplishing all sorts of tasks, ranging from killing high-ranked officers to sabotaging entire U-Boats. The graphics arent't up to date, but the game looks very nice. There's so much detail in everything and the game manages to create an extremely realistic and tense atmosphere! The Uniforms, the guard routines, the Nazi hierarchy and the layout of the levels... The 40s march music sounding from the radio and the Nazis themselves chatting in German (The German is perfect by the way, they hired native speakers). Not so perfect are the German signs and Book texts, but that won't bother you unless you're a native German speaker.\n\nDeath to Spies isn't your average shooter, it's a stealth game at it's finest. Simply drawing a weapon at the wrong time will get you killed in an instant.\n\nI would not recommend it for impatient people, because in some levels you may have to sit around for quite some time to figure out what you're supposed to do.\n\nI honestly don't understand why this game got so little attention when it was released...","May 4, 2014","true","29.3"," 33 of 42 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","33","42","0","0"

After a couple of years I could finaly play it again, and it has aged well. Like a fine wine, Death to Spies: Moment of Truth is best enjoyed in short sips. Take your time with it and feel how its taste brings you into another world.\n\nSet in WW2 and the early days of the cold war, you play as a Russian spy and infiltrate German bases and camps. There are also 3 missions in the USA, the UK and a Soviet base (with a bunch of filthy traitors! hrrrng!). The levels (except for the USA level) are AMAZING. Even tough the "objective zone" isn't always that huge, you have the feeling that you could travel the whole world from your current location. Detailed bases and vehicles decorate a realistic, living world that  really sucks you into the game. There are tons of weapons, uniforms, driveable vehicles and many different ways to solve a problem.\n\nTiny minus point is the German writting and speech in some of the levels, but this shouldn't bother anyone too much.","August 7, 2013","true","12.7"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","21","22","0","0"

If you require a good game which involves planning, thinking, observing and acting at the right moment this game is for you. You really need to play the first one before hand which is now really cheap and just as good! The first one has a boot camp which introduces you to the franchise and gives you all the basic controls. This one just throws you in to continue the story! It has driveable vehicles, many weapons and objects to use at your disposal. You can use, steal and loot enemy weapons, uniforms (and get away with wearing them) and the enemy are none the wiser unless you pass  SS personelle or an Wehrmacht officer. This is a modern version of "Hidden and Dangerous" series which is my all time favourite but no longer obtainable or playable on recent versions of Windows. You choose your weapons, kit, equipment and even a backpack to carry extra things to help such as wire cutters, explosives and compass/binoculars ect ect.\n\nTakes forever to play and even longer to complete but at the end it's deffinitely worth it! Replayability is good and each mission has hours of different approaches. It's not a run and gun (although you can do this if you choose) if you wish to survive minutes or create a party conga line of enemies in a bunker doorway. Personally I give this game a 9/10 purely because the concept is genius, but the 1 it missed out on was because they have not made another one which is disappointing! No DLC or future anouncements of further franchise expantions which is a shame but does not cull the name of these two little beauties which are Death to Spies and Death to Spies - Moment Of Truth.\n\nGo on....make a party conga line of Nazis in a submarine base....you know you want to ;-)","August 6, 2014","true","22.1"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","21","22","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bobobaggins/recommended/34410/","bobobaggins","Consigliere","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bobobaggins/","352 products in account","Russian, WWII-era Hitman.  I didn't really even know anyone had ever attempted to do something like Hitman. And what a brilliant mix, a Hitman game about killing Nazis!\n\nOkay, so first off, this game ran fine (Windows 7 x64 still), in widescreen at good resolution without any effort on my part whatsoever, all I had to do was disable depth of field to get rid of some nasty textures.  You can't even get most Hitman games to run in widescreen without doing all sorta funky hacks, and again, its a Russian game, most Russian games I've played required serious effort to get running on any modern system.\n\nThat outta the way. HOW DID I MISS THIS!?! I love the Hitman games, and this is arguably better than some of the old Hitmans, maybe even on par with Blood Money (maybe, I reserve judgement until I've finished the game).  I've never heard of Death to Spies until this sale, which really sucks because it does some things better than even Hitman does. For starters, if you shoot a dude anywhere but in the head, or if you slit his throat//stab him, the uniform he's wearing has bulletholes/blood stains, which are a dead-giveaway, so you can't use it.  Small, simple, brilliant. The objectives are a lot different, the primary focus isn't necessarily assassination like it is in Hitman, you're more of a spy than an assassin in many cases, you just have a license to kill and you USE IT =D\n\nSecond, this game rates your performance waaaayyyy differently, killing someone other than your designated target doesn't automatically bone you out of the highest ratings, its more about how professional, silent and clean you are. Strangle a guard and hide the body - and containers to put bodies in are rare in this game, you just have to dump them somewhere out of the way - and you're golden; make a mess, have a body get found, or set off an alarm though and your score is obviously penalized like most stealth games.  If they find a naked body you've taken the uniform for, they start looking for intruders wearing that uniform, making it useless and lowering your score.  However, you have a backpack, and you can actually carry disguises with you, again something we've never seen from Hitman. You have to do more than wear the clothes though, if you're disguised as a Nazi soldier, you need to swap out Russian weaponry for German weaponry, found on bodies usually, or you can choose to start the mission with German guns in most/all cases. If they see you using Russian guns while posing as a German sentry, their suspicion of you raises very quickly. Additionally, your dude can go prone and crawl, which is really useful in open, outdoor sections without generous cover (not to mention making sniping a hell of a lot easier).\n\nYou do have a non-lethal option, namely a bottle of chloroform that works similar to how it did in Hitman 2 though it has 5-10 uses and 1 use knocks out an enemy for the rest of the mission, whereas knockouts in H2 only lasted minutes. You can also just punch someone in the face, but its not as effective and is noisy. Also of note, you can actually drive vehicles in this game, which was never a thing in Hitman; its useful too since the maps are pretty big; you can even use a truck that has a canopy to hide a body and move it around. On the hardest difficulty, the ability to take disguises is removed entirely, which basically equates to some missions being impossible to get through without garroting a few patrols and guards, however you also get an automatic score boost, to rectify any loose ends you had to tie up.\n\nI'm excited for the third one, it originally failed a kickstarter I think, and its not the original developers or publishers, and its more of a spiritual successor than direct sequel since its a different main character and set in the Cold War, but they have something here, excited to see where they go with it ---\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/406720/","December 29, 2015","true","4.4"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","18","18","0","0"

Whistling to distract. Three stances with two movement speeds between them. Usable vehicles (with usable horns.)\nAccident systems.\nAt least one level with a straight up logistics puzzle.\nOh, and really solid, clockwork inspired music.\n\nMost impressively, easy difficulty has more spaced out patrols and scripted lures that don't exist on other difficulties, ensuring that even novices have more than a fair chance to understand the workings of the game.\n\nThis isn't for people who want a story with their game. Frankly, this isn't for people who want anything but a raw, enjoyable set of levels that end up being fun to play through.\nThe animations aren't the best, nor is the plot anything amazing, and the combat AI isn't fantastic. That said, if you're picking this up the odds are you're not looking for any of those things.\n\nIf you like stealth for stealth's sake, this is easily one of the best games you can pick up on Steam.\nIt's the expansion pack Hitman: Blood Money never got, and you owe it to yourself to pick it up.","March 24","true","140.9"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","18","18","0","2"

It's a bit more graphically demanding. AI has decreased in quantity and increased in quality - there isn't that spamming of enemies and civvies on a tiny map that you got with DtS 1.\n\nThe fewer AI require more "fooling" though - you won't get by with just dressing up as an officer. You will have to dress up as several different character types throughout each level (civvie, worker, butler, soldier, officer, scientist, cop, FBI agent) and have the relevant paperwork in order to be granted access to various sections of the map. The levels and challenges are much more unique, so you won't be doing the same thing over and over again, but instead complete different tasks each mission (reconnaissance, assassination, kidnapping, sabotage, counterintelligence, intel theft).\n\nOverall, DtS: MoT is a shorter, higher-quality version of DtS 1 and is definitely worth playing.","November 25, 2014","true","17.2"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","0"

So basically you are pretty much open to do whatever you want withthis game.\n\nWays to kill in this game :\n\n*Total stealth. - Sneak up on them and Garrotte, or Chloriform them.\n*Brutal Stealth. - Cut their throat, Beat them up with your fists, Hit them with countless blunt objects.\n*Non-Stealth. - Landmines, Booby trap bodies, Rig doors to explode, or set up countless "scripted events" to happen.\n*Stealth at a distance. Throw Knives. Throw Coffeecups, and otehr map objects. Use silenced guns (including silenced sniper rifles.)\n\nLots of startout items!!\nPoision\nFirst aid\nThrowing knifes\nGarotte\nChloriform\nlandmines\nGrenades\nHuge selection of guns.

There as several tweaks incuding the ability to carry a disguise in your backpack, the addition of yellow enemies whom get suspicious only if you get close.\n\nThe biggest change is the disguise system where its more about getting the right disguise for the task as opposed to going straight for the officer disguise, for example in the second mission the officer disguise is good for the 3rd floor however in the shipyard most enemies are suspicious towards the officer. However most of the time getting the officer disguise will do the job.\n\nSome negatives about the game are its length, there are only seven missions, a lack of tutorial, leaving players confused and struggling unless they played the first game, there is a visiual filter that gives the game a sepia filter, which looks extremely ugly in my opinion however you can get rid of it by disabling depth of feild also vehicles are not well utilised, they can be used in 3 missions only and are not too useful.\n\nThe biggest flaw was that the game didn't give you as much help as it should, sometimes I would get stuck and have to go to a guide to work out what to do. For example in one mission I needed to kick a bucket of water on my target to get him to a secluded location, however the bucket looked just like a normal prop and the map didn't highlight the location of the bucket leading to frustration.\n\nOverall if you liked the first game or enjoyed the brutal difficulty of Hitman 2 and Contracts you will enjoy this one, the game is just as unforgiving. Your freedom to choose how to acheive your objectives is less than the extent in hitman but more or less the same as the first game.\n\nPros:\n-Graphics are better.\n-You have some freedom to choose how to acheive your objectives.\n-Unique Disguise gameplay is excellent, this and hitman are the only games that utilise this feature effectively.\nCons:\n-Can be confusing\n-Quite short\n-No Tutorial\n\n","June 9, 2014","true","47.2"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

The game's main character is Semion Strogov, a captain in the 4th department of the Soviet counterintelligence service called SMERSH.

Strogov is back from his previous missions and must now participate in a series of even more complicated and exciting military operations under the code name "Death to Spies: Moment of Truth". The hero possesses all the skills required to accomplish especially dangerous missions including, getting information about the disposition of hostile military and civil units, assassination of enemy agents and representatives of Wehrmacht’s high-ranking officers and espionage.

Coolest thing about this game is each uniform you find from the germans you are only able to get in certain places due to your rank of the soldiers uniform. For this being said you then would have to find a german officer uniform so you can get into restricted areas. Inventory system is well done and can carry backpacks to hold more items. You can also drive cars, trucks, and bikes. Using allie weapons can alarm the enemys if your in disguise. Lockpicking system is pretty cool.\n\n\nIf your a steath person and enjoyed the hitman series, than this is the series for you!","February 25, 2015","true","5.8"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

A lot of the gameplay will be extremely familiar to you and you will enjoy it the same way you enjoyed Hitman. Hell, it's even got an "A new life" type of level where there's a house being guarded by the feds, and the game plays out like Hitman: Contracts, where you watch as Agnet 47 wakes up and then play through his memories of the missions that led up to this point.\n\nDeath to Spies has all of that.\n\nIf you haven't played Hitman, but you're interested in Death to Spies, the game basically works as a giant playground of strategic freedom. You enter the level, receive your objectives, and then the game stops holding your hand while you work out everything yourself. You choose what order you'll complete the objectives in, how many people you'll kill, and plant all kinds of traps to catch your enemy off guard.\n\nMy main problems with this game is that the controls can be a little clunky at times, and that CTRL+S quicksaves, for some reason. F5 already does that, game. I don't need another control to do that for me.\n\nOther than that, Death to Spies: Moment of Truth, is an exciting extension of Hitman that I would definitely recommend to any stealth strategy fans.","December 20, 2015","true","11.9"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

You're a Soviet officer infiltrating Nazi bases, British codebreaker camps, etc, usually (but not always) to assassinate someone or to sabotage their government. It's not as visually impressive as the late Hitmans, but I think it's probably a lot more clever AI-wise.\n\nOne notable feature is the option to play any mission with disguises turned off, but with silenced weapons -- this basically turns the game from Hitman to Metal Gear Solid and often forces you to approach levels completely differently (and usually with a much higher casualty count). Good stuff!","July 27, 2012","true","12.1"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

As i wrote in previous game's review, it's just WWII Hitman. In this game everything is set very classic style. And it's just perfect. Very good AI, gameplay, Beautiful & accurate atmosphere which has ambience of WWII and similar old times. (villages, castle, open ground, vehicles, trains, inner ambience & architecture etc.) This game must get good place in stealth/stealth assassination games. Very nice work!.

It's incredibly difficult at times as the enemy AI is pretty smart and will recognize odd behavior (which can vary depending on which uniform you've disguised yourself in).  This is a game that takes stealthy undercover spy work very seriously. If you run-and-gun, you're as good as dead.\n\nThe best part is that you're free to complete your objectives however you see fit!  Say there's a high ranking Nazi official you've got to assassinate.  Do you want to plant explosives on the runway so his plane explodes when he lands or do you want to impersonate an SS officer, get the official alone and stab him?  How about take him out from a distance with a sniper rifle?  Those options (and tons more) are available.","July 13, 2012","true","31.9"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

I'm a paranoid, slow player in stealthy games. Took me less than 20 hours each. Still, they are non-linear stealth games, which makes them rare and valuable.\n\n9/10.
