For anyone who enjoyed the PC release of Motorhead, this is not it. This is the PSX version. The screenshot previews of the game do not even do the shoddy graphics justice. It gave me a headache to even try to play this in fullscreen, and windowed mode is not much better. This game is also impossible to play with a keyboard, which is what I used to play the game back when it was originally released, and the controls cannot be modified. So please do your best to enjoy utilizing both WSAD and the NUM PAD not only to drive your vehicle, but to decrypt the main menu navigation, as the mouse does absolutely nothing.\n\nPlease do not waste your money on this game. There were no reviews for it when I purchased it, so I had no forewarning of how bad of a port it would be. You're better off finding the PC port elsewhere. It's a vastly superior experience to this version.","September 16, 2015","false","0.1"," 60 of 71 people (85%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","85","60","71","5","1"

I thought maybe they did something foolish, and chose bad screenshots to show off the game, but no, the game looks worse on my GTX 780 than it did on my Voodoo 2.  Somehow there are actually framerate problems too making it difficult to play.\n\nYou can see how the game should look: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0A2uWu52WI\n\nOn the plus side, there is controller support, including for xbox 360 controller. Best thing I can say about the game is that the soundtrack is retained (tied with Wipeout XL for best racing soundtrack).\n\nNot recommended to actually play the game.","September 16, 2015","false","0.6"," 54 of 64 people (84%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","84","54","64","7","4"

They ported the PSOne version!" It would be awesome if it was the PC version. If i wanted to play a PSOne, i would stick to the emulator.","October 2, 2015","false","0.1"," 18 of 25 people (72%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","72","18","25","3","2"

All of twenty minutes to figure out that this games cant be tweeked or configured to overcome the graphic issues before I requested a refund. On a lighter not this game is extremely hard to find on cd I `ve  seen it on cd, amazon and ebay this is probably due to the fact that  Fox interactive went out of business Fifteen years ago.","December 24, 2015","false","0.4"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","1"

Just flat out racing if you're in need of it.\n\nAND DANK MIDIs","November 30, 2015","true","0.4"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","27","3","11","2","0"
