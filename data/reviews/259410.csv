At first it seems a bit flat on the gameplay-side, but it keeps adding some features so it wont get boring of the whole play time. It is controled entirely with the mouse, so its perfect for a session while eating a snack, watching tv/twitch or anything else. For this low price IÂ´ll totally recommend this little gem.\n\nPro	    Not to complicated, but it will add some features over time - like Items,diffrent enemies with diffrent patterns - and a barrel\nA perfect timefiller in short bursts\nAppealing light-hearted cartoon-style\nContra	    A bit too easy\nSometimes the mouse-input seems not the best choice\nFlat story - You are a thief, your loot gets stolen - get it back\nVerdict\nAfter my playtime of round about 4h I completed the game to 100%, but for the low price you get a beatiful, light-hearted stealth-game . Highly recomended for stealthfans, even its not the hardest game out there in this genre. Hopefully the developer makes a sequel.","August 8, 2015","true","4.2"," 30 of 32 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","30","32","0","0"

I honestly thoroughly enjoyed the game play. The learning curve is not steep at all, and once you master the mechanics, you'll breeze through the content. I can imagine racing your friends for the best completion time would extend the life of the game in a fun and social way as well!\n\nBottom line, give this company a chance, and I can see them producing high-quality content in the future.","November 12, 2014","true","2.7"," 36 of 42 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","36","42","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/259410/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Sneaky Sneaky plays a little like a stealth board-game.\n\nEverything functions on very deliberate set of turns and movement speeds, constrained to a grid that acts as a means to make enemy fields of view immediately understandable. Most of Sneaky Sneaky's mechanics are fairly basic, confined to hiding in bushes and stabbing enemies in the back, but developer Naiad Entertainment manages to do a surprising amount with the few systems they have to work with. The further you progress the more involved encounters become, always consisting of only single rooms but adding in different enemy types each with a specific movement and attack pattern, and more options to use parts of the environment to hide and pick them off unawares.\n\nSneaky Sneaky feels a bit more like a puzzle game in this regard than a traditional stealth game. The question is usually less about how you can sneak past enemies and more along the lines of what the most efficient way to take them out would be. And it's a surprising amount of fun for how basic most of your interactions are, with the cute graphics helping a lot to make for much more lighthearted stealth affair than we're used to seeing.\n\nUndermining this are the annoying controls, which use solely the mouse and single clicks for every action, but often demand more precision than such a simple control scheme allows. More than just making it difficult for me to quickly position my character (which is rather important when every enemy has such an exact movement speed that you need to exploit), my clicks would often not register or register too late and have me walking straight into the view of an enemy. I was constantly fighting with the controls and never confident they would do what I wanted them too, with almost every death and enemy sighting feeling the fault of a touch oriented control scheme instead of poor planning on my part.\n\nWhat's so disappointing about this is it's such an easy problem to fix, whether by adding in a more appropriate keyboard or controller control scheme, or simply making the entire game turn based as happens when you're spotted. Either would almost entirely fix Sneaky Sneaky's biggest issue, and make it immensely easier to recommend, though whether either change is on the way I couldn't say. I'd be lying if I said I didn't have a lot of fun with Sneaky Sneaky, but I can only imagine how much more I'd have liked it if I hadn't been forced to play it like a mobile game.","December 13, 2014","true","2.7"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","17","19","0","0"

The game isn't overly difficult, once you learn how things work you should easily get the top ranking on most stages on your first attempt. The RPG elements aren't overly deep and by the end you'll have lvled up everything. Lastly on the negatives the game is very short. I completed the game, gathered the collectables, and went back to get a gold ranking on every stage and came in at 3.3h of gameplay. So its a pretty brief experience. Aside from the negatives though i had a great time playing through the game and now that the developers have lowered the cost to $5 I'd say its certainly worth picking up for a fun night of sneaky sneaky action.

While i would like to see keyboard controls in certain hectic situations, mouse controls actually feel pretty great. Game runs at solid 60fps (maybe more, i haven't checked), doesn't have microtransactions, broken economy, grind or any other shenanigans iOS ports are known for.\n\nAll in all, i would really like to see a sequel developed as a full fledged PC game instead since this style of stealth puzzle has a great potential but i feel like iOS root drag it down.","October 15, 2015","true","3.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/caseymae3/recommended/259410/","caseymae3","caseymae","http://steamcommunity.com/id/caseymae3/","42 products in account","This game was fun, but very short. Only 17 levels... actually 15 since "The End" can't honestly count as a level and the first one is technically a tutorial.\n\nThere are plenty of ways the levels can be completed and played, which explains the abundance of achievements for this small game. But for someone who isn't necessarily interested in getting achievements and would rather just play the game (like myself), I was able to complete the game fairly quickly and without having to use too many of the items in-game.\n\nThat doesn't necessarily mean that the game was easy, however. It definitely has its challenges when it comes to fighting certain enemies, figuring out how to open different gates, and finding ways to sneak around safely. But, what takes all of that difficulty away is the fact that if/when you do die, the game just restarts you in that same room. I personally think it would be more challenging if you were put back at the beginning of the level to start all over again when you die. It would make you take your character's health more seriously.\n\nAlso, not sure if this was a problem that only I was experiencing, but anytime I exited the game it would just freeze right there at the main menu. I could not alt+tab back to my desktop and the game wouldn't do what it normally should do (just close and return me to whatever window I was on previously). I had to open task manager just to get back to my desktop. It was just a minor annoyance.\n\nI recommend this game because despite the couple of cons it has, it was still an enjoyable short game, but I also think you should only buy it when it's on sale.","February 9","true","5.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

In the game, you have to get back a sack of gems that is taken away from you on the start, There are 17 Stages, and Three "Scenarios", Respectively, The Woods, The Canyon (Desert) and The City, each one presents different enemies and different mechanics.\n\nThe main character (Your character) has 4 Different "Skills":\n\n- Health : Ammount of hearts (Most enemies deal 1 Heart of damage, Some deal 0.5, some deal 1.5 and some deal more.)\n\n- Melee Damage : Damage with the sword (You have to be on the tile next to the enemy to meele him)\n\n- Ranged Damage : Bow (You have to manually aim)\n\n- Walking Distance : Ammount of tiles you can walk using one (Of three) "Charges" while in "Combat Mode".\n\nEach time you level up you can add one point to each of them (12 levels total), Health has 5 Possible upgrades, Melee has 2, Ranged has 2 and Walking has 2.\n\nThere is a shop where you can buy, Health potions, Ham (bait), Mana potion (Fills your "Charges" while in combat mode), Hammer (lets you break rocks), Sleepy potion (You add them to arrows and you can make your enemies sleep instead of killing/harming them) and The barrel (You "wear" a barrel and you are completely sneaky for one stage.)\n\nCons of the game :\n\n- Short - 17 Stages, While they are all "Easy" if you dont care about maxing out the points.\n\n- The game doesnt force you to use all mechanics. - I personally only used The bow, sword, health potion and ham. If you are very good (And full of patience) you can finish all stages flawlessly with only a bow and sword.\n\n\nPros:\n\n- Its fun to try and beat all stages 100%. - + Achievments\n\n- The gameplay can get intense if youre almost getting caugh.\n\n- Lots of different paths to get to the ending.\n\n- Lots of different enemies and mechanics\n\n- The art is fun, which makes you be able to play the game for an indefinite ammount of time without tiring of it.\n\n- Some posters have some fun jokes - "The right to brag." , "20 Mins of backrub", etc\n\n- Variety of enemies\n\n- Price\n\n- I only stumbled across 1 bug\n\nConclusion:\n\nI recommend the game to people who like to 100% everything, as it is fun and due to the art style, you can play it for a long time. It is cheap and provides you with at least 3 Hours of fun! I'd say that even peolpe who dont like puzzle games should buy it, to be honest.\n\nSound/Music : 9/10 - Funky and matches the game. Creates a mood.\nArt : 10/10 - The art style matches the game perfectly, Everything is colorful so it doesnt tire your eyes.\nEnjoyability : 8.5 / 10 - If there were more stages, this game would be flawless.\nOverall : 9/10\n\n\nSuggestions:\n\n- Add scoreboards so we can compare our scores for each stage to other people! Would incentivate lots of people to buy due to the competitivity!\n\n- Add Bonus points due to time (The less time, the more extra points)\n\n- Release more stages!\n\n- Add map editors, so we can create our own stages and share with people on an in-game hub!\n\nProps to the devs. Very fun game!","October 25, 2015","true","5.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You play a cute looking thief, who's after the Sultan's rubies, that are now spread everywhere across the map and 3 per level. (why is that gets clear from the opening cinematic).\nThe game is a mixture of turn-based combat with rpg elements and stealth action! The levels consist of a bunch of rooms connected together with one or more pathways.You can always check the map of the current level you're in by pausing the game. Once you enter a room, you notice the enemies inside (if there are any) and see their field of view. Unless you're detected by an enemy, you can freely walk around, gather stuff, trash some barrels, chop down some trees ... fun stuff. One you get detected, the game transforms into this turn based action, but with a twist - you get 3 actions per turn, or well 3 turns before the roles turn. This can be crucial, as you start the game with 3 hearts as your health pool, and if you have not upgraded that and a tough enemy spots you and deals a heart of damage per attack - you're basically rekt. So yea - staying stealthy in a stealth game is pretty important :p so hide in the bushes and behind an obstacle from enemies line of sight  . That, or you have to initiate first, so you get the first 3 turns and oneshot the enemy! The easiest way to do that, is shoot from a distance. You can't shoot from the start of the game, but you learn to use your bow fairly early, and chop down trees and barrels to convert them to arrows, as you can only carry 3 by default. That can be tricky in on itself, as barrels and trees are you main line of sight blocker, that you hide behind.\nI think the game is split / themed into chapters with 5 levels each. Once you change the chapter, everything changes - the enemies, the surroundings, the music ... I'm not so far into the game - completed level 2-2, but I've seen quite a few different enemies : you have your standard guards with swords, you have a melee blob, a ranged blob, a badass wolf(I think it's a wolf) and now skeletons and snakes ... pretty good. Now you might think, that enemies move in a pattern around the rooms they are in, but that's not necessarily the case - if you chop a tree or a barrel, or eliminate an enemy - their movement pattern changes / might change, so getting the drop on them is not as simple, as you might think. Most of the time you will be waiting patiently in the bushes for them to pass by so you can oneshot them with a sneak attack, or dropping a tasty meat on the ground to get their attention, so you can calmly backstab. I mean you can probably go all Rambo, upgrade your health pool first and enter the rooms guns blazing, or well ... bow, chugging potions like an addict, but I prefer the sneaky sneaky gameplay. Important to note : when you die you can restart the level, or restart the current room you died in. If you restart the room - all enemies inside are back to life and you're with 3 hearts of life ( even if you've upgraded your total).\nI think the game looks really beautiful and colorful and cute and just perfect for my taste. I find the music fitting with the overall spirit of the game ( I think the word I'm searching for is cuteness ) The controls are ... o wait, it's just the one - the control is done solely by your mouse, even the movement - maybe the game is a port from a mobile device, or made with a mobile devise in mind(the 3 stars rating system for accomplished level is a dead giveaway). I really like how you shoot the arrows, it's really thoughtful, but I do like me some keyboard controls - even if it's only for the character movement. I'm not so keen on gamepad support, but I'm sure some people will want that / point to the lack of it.\nBeside the rubies, that you gather 3 per level, there are some coins / bag of dosh, that you find on each level, and that you use to buy goodies from the ingame shop - health potions, meat bait, a larger quiver and so on. Potion prices look reasonable, quiver looks a bit overpriced in my eyes, might be wrong, I'm not sure how much money you get for replaying a level, or even if you get any.\nNow there is a character progression in the game - you level up and can improve 4 stats- health pool, melee damage, range damage and movement speed. I'm 7 levels into the game and I'm level 6, don't think I have replayed a level - so the progress is pretty good. Then again, now I notice, that you need level 12 to max all your skills, so I guess the game is not as lengthy as I thought! That might be an issue for some people, especially with this price tag. So in the light of recent past(Halloween) and upcoming (Xmas) sales, you might wanna wait and grab this one when cheaper, as the game is definitely worth playing.\n\nTL:DR you can check my overview video as I show you levels 1-5 and 2-1\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=341188102","November 13, 2014","true","2.1"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","9","18","0","0"

Unless you're detected by an enemy, you can freely walk around, gather stuff, trash some barrels, chop down some trees ... fun stuff. One you get detected, the game transforms into this turn based action, but with a twist - you get 3 actions per turn, or well 3 turns before the roles turn. This can be crucial, as you start the game with 3 hearts as your health pool, and if you have not upgraded that and a tough enemy spots you and deals a heart of damage per attack - you're basically rekt. So yea - staying stealthy in a stealth game is pretty important :p so hide in the bushes and behind an obstacle from enemies line of sight  . That, or you have to initiate first, so you get the first 3 turns and oneshot the enemy! The easiest way to do that, is shoot from a distance. You can't shoot from the start of the game, but you learn to use your bow fairly early, and chop down trees and barrels to convert them to arrows, as you can only carry 3 by default. That can be tricky in on itself, as barrels and trees are you main line of sight blocker, that you hide behind.\nI think the game is split / themed into chapters with 5 levels each. Once you change the chapter, everything changes - the enemies, the surroundings, the music ... I'm not so far into the game - completed level 2-2, but I've seen quite a few different enemies : you have your standard guards with swords, you have a melee blob, a ranged blob, a badass wolf(I think it's a wolf) and now skeletons and snakes ... pretty good. Now you might think, that enemies move in a pattern around the rooms they are in, but that's not necessarily the case - if you chop a tree or a barrel, or eliminate an enemy - their movement pattern changes / might change, so getting the drop on them is not as simple, as you might think. Most of the time you will be waiting patiently in the bushes for them to pass by so you can oneshot them with a sneak attack, or dropping a tasty meat on the ground to get their attention, so you can calmly backstab. I mean you can probably go all Rambo, upgrade your health pool first and enter the rooms guns blazing, or well ... bow, chugging potions like an addict, but I prefer the sneaky sneaky gameplay. Important to note : when you die you can restart the level, or restart the current room you died in. If you restart the room - all enemies inside are back to life and you're with 3 hearts of life ( even if you've upgraded your total).\nI think the game looks really beautiful and colorful and cute and just perfect for my taste. I find the music fitting with the overall spirit of the game ( I think the word I'm searching for is cuteness ) The controls are ... o wait, it's just the one - the control is done solely by your mouse, even the movement - maybe the game is a port from a mobile device, or made with a mobile devise in mind(the 3 stars rating system for accomplished level is a dead giveaway). I really like how you shoot the arrows, it's really thoughtful, but I do like me some keyboard controls - even if it's only for the character movement. I'm not so keen on gamepad support, but I'm sure some people will want that / point to the lack of it.\nBeside the rubies, that you gather 3 per level, there are some coins / bag of dosh, that you find on each level, and that you use to buy goodies from the ingame shop - health potions, meat bait, a larger quiver and so on. Potion prices look reasonable, quiver looks a bit overpriced in my eyes, might be wrong, I'm not sure how much money you get for replaying a level, or even if you get any.\nNow there is a character progression in the game - you level up and can improve 4 stats- health pool, melee damage, range damage and movement speed. I'm 7 levels into the game and I'm level 6, don't think I have replayed a level - so the progress is pretty good. Then again, now I notice, that you need level 12 to max all your skills, so I guess the game is not as lengthy as I thought! That might be an issue for some people, especially with this price tag. So in the light of recent past(Halloween) and upcoming (Xmas) sales, you might wanna wait and grab this one when cheaper, as the game is definitely worth playing.\n\nTL:DR you can check my overview video as I show you levels 1-5 and 2-1\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=341188102","November 13, 2014","true","2.1"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","9","18","0","0"

Enemies move in a series of periodic steps, and shifts into turn-based movement if you are detected. In addition to avoiding detection, your character gets a number of items and weapons which they can use to take care of enemies. This actually gets the game to land squarely in that narrow range in between "instant lose if detected" and "too powerful so detection is meaningless" which is exceptionally rare in stealth games, and is the place where the best ones tend to reside.\n\nIt's rather short - I was able to 100% it in about 4 hours. However, the art style and level design lends itself to a sort of polished charm which is often lacking from games of this length.\n\nIt's a good bit of fun, and well worth the asking price of 5 bucks.","January 29, 2015","true","4.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

If it was $1-2 I would say go ahead and buy it but it's just not that great.\n\nThe art is pretty nice but the gameplay itself is extremely boring and the levels are not that interesting. It plays like a flash ipad game, and if you were playing it on the ipad it would probably slightly more enjoyable.\n\nHowever it still has some major design flaws in my opinion. For example when you level-up all of the abilities that you get (attack dmg up, bow dmg up, movement distance up, hearts up) are all pointless. When you kill a creature sneakily (the name of the game right?) then it's always a 1-shot kill. Thus, in my opinion the game should just drop all of the fighting stuff and just focus on the sneaking. If you get spotted, that should be it, you should get killed without any other options and then have to restart the level. Thus turning it into more of the puzzle / strategy game that it really should be. As it is now it has virtually no strategy and is extremely simple.\n\nThe only difficulty the game has is introdcued by the awkward controls, where the enemies are moving around in real-time and if you click on certain places your guy may take no action at all and thus be standing in the wrong place at the wrong time. I would much rather they converted this game into a turn-based puzzler with more interesting strategy.","November 14, 2014","false","6.2"," 16 of 33 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","16","33","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tgr1/recommended/259410/","tgr1","Kelly Osbourne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tgr1/","434 products in account","The following review is taken in full from http://criticalindiegamer.com/2014/11/sneaky-sneaky-review-pc/\n\n\nA few weeks back a little thief snuck their way onto the website, plundering rubies and capturing hearts as they went. Naiad Entertainmentâs Sneaky Sneaky left us suitably impressed when we previewed it, and now you can get your hands on it too, on Steam!\n\nWe arenât going to beat around the bush, reiterating what has already been said, but Sneaky Sneaky is a lovely little debut from Naiad. In it you play as a thief out to find the Sultanâs rubies, whilst collecting golden coins to keep your arsenal stocked up. Thereâs even some light RPG elements that allow you to level up your speed, health and the amount of damage that you deal. All of this takes place within a pretty pseudo-turn based world.\n\nWhen you havenât been spotted by enemies you are free to roam around the map, collecting items and smashing up barrels. But as soon as you have been spotted the game shifts to a more traditional turn-based RPG affair. During these phases your enemies and you will each get three turns to move and fight.\n\nNaturally, as the gameâs name suggests, you are much better off staying out of sight and striking when your enemyâs back is turned, but If you are quick enough you can land a quick backstab. But you also have a bow and arrow at your disposal. Using the bow is one of Sneaky Sneakyâs real pleasures, because it is wonderfully rewarding to use. Left clicking and pulling the mouse cursor back readies your arrow, allowing you to turn and track your opponent. Releasing the left mouse button sends your arrow hurtling towards the enemy, and land a direct hit if youâve timed things properly.\n\nThereâs an undeniable âearly Zeldaâ feel to the game and perhaps a visual nod here and there. Each level feels like it could have easily been in A Link To The Past â high praise indeed! Youâll visit a handful of different areas from arid deserts, leafy green forests, caves and towns looking for your rubies and the quickest way to the exit.\n\nEach area has its own traps to avoid, or to use to your advantage. For example, certain levels contain spikes that can be activated by a switch, and crafty players could entice enemies by placing some food on the deactivated spikes, only to re-activate them when they are standing on top. And thatâs another ace up Sneaky Sneakyâs sleeve, its combat is so versatile and elastic that youâll always have multiple options at your disposal. If you want to go Rambo and take everything out by force then feel free, itâll be tougher but it is possible. The real reward, though, lays in staying out of sight and picking enemies off one by one, without being noticed. Not only does the game play best like this, youâll be rewarded much more handsomely at the end of each level. Levels come with three rankings, bronze, silver and gold, so completionists  will find a decent challenge in collecting every ruby and every gold medal, but itâs rewarding fun.\n\nSneaky Sneakyâs presentation is similar to many other high quality games youâve probably seen on iOS or Android; sprites are clean, nicely animated and colourful, and although the interface is undeniably lifted from the mobile version of the game, it works well and is easy to navigate .\n\nControls are a real breeze too and feel responsive and intuitive. Little touches like pulling the mouse back to ready your bow feel natural, and show the care and dedication that has gone into the PC version of the game.\n\nWhether you are young or old, hardcore or casual, Sneaky Sneaky is a compelling little proposition. Itâs the perfect game to play a few levels at a time and leave running on your desktop. Kids will eat up its cartoon aesthetic whilst finding the gameplay accessible, and adults will enjoy the versatility of its combat. Pick it up on Steam, itâs a steal!\n\n","November 12, 2014","true","5.3"," 13 of 27 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","13","27","0","0"

I also liked how the game let me discover how things work, instead of guiding me too much in the beggining.\n- The music and the art are an absolute joy to watch and listen to. The entire thing looks hand-painted and is filled with funny details. The little sounds made by the enemies are funny and fit the overall theme of the game.\n- The levels aren't too long, and there's no real penalty for failing. This in turn allows you to try different things quickly and to find your own way to play.\nNegatives:\n- Short game. Three to four hours is all you can get from the game, and that's if you want to collect all the achievements. Kind of steep for a 5â¬ game.\n- The combat is turn based, except both you and your enemies get 3 turns instead of one. This felt unfair to me, especially when the enemy has the first "round". Often you'll find yourself being beaten to death without even getting a chance to run or hide (which I would assume would be a good strategy in a game where the protagonist is called Sneaky).\n- Whenever you destroy something in the map (be it a barrel, an enemy or something else), you then move to the cell where the thing previously was, instead of staying where you were. I have no idea why the developers insisted on this, and maybe there's even some sound logic behind it. For me, this was just frustrating, as more often than not I ended up being detected by some other monster because of it.\n\nOverall, I'd say it was a positive experience!\n7/10, would steal gems again.","March 22, 2015","true","3.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I'd give it a very solid nine out of ten. Can only recommend it, especially since the price has been permanently reduced.\n\nLONG VERSION\n\nWhen I made a Steam account a good friend of mine suprised me with this little gem of a game. That was many months ago and only now did I finally get around to finish everything. It has been a blast through and through and I decided to delete the save file just so I can unlock everything again during yet another playthrough somewhere down the line.\n\nThe visuals are absolutely charming, the soundtrack fits the mood perfectly, and the gameplay offers enough variation to keep things interesting. The name would make you think that you'll be doing nothing but sneaking around corners but you have the option to confront enemies up close with a dagger, take them out from afar with a bow, use the environment against them or employ items found during your journey to give you an edge.\n\nThere's a bit of RPG element to it as you level up your thief's stats and unlock new items but ultimately the game maintains its focus on the puzzle aspect. The controls are slightly clunky in a sense that you can't always predict if Sneaky moves from one tile to another just a split second before an enemy spots him or not. Leveling his speed helps but this can lend to some frustrating moments early on.\n\nOther than that, my only complaint is the length. The game itself, if you're decent at these sort of things, can be completed in two hours. Anything after that is pure fluff - playing to increase the stats of Sneaky, to get whatever achievement you missed and to reach the highscore on each map. In my case, all of that took fifteen hours.\n\nIn closing, I would like to thank Naiad Entertainment for the experience and I hope we'll see a sequel one day.

I highly recommend it for players who are thiefs inside their hearts and always wants to kill everyone silently.

Even though I like to play on easy mode, some require a "survival" mode, which is not provided here.\n\nThis is a perfect game on my steam profile and I only needed 3 hours to do everything.

It was brilliantly simple and very well designed. The gameplay is ULTRA tight and refined. The art style is extremely clean and pleasent and the overall game is exactly as long (or rather: as short) as it needs to be. Sneaky Sneaky doesn't overstay it's welcome. The storyline is extremely simple but at the same time, it is the essence of a more complex story. Like the rest of the game, it is only the most important elements of a story.\n\nI've recommended quite a few games but this one in particular I would say is an essential play. Sneaky Sneaky represents what I believe to be a game that is the most well distilled, honed and perfected title I've seen since Portal 1. Sneaky Sneaky is exactly what it should have been from start to finish and there is nothing else that it needs to be.\n\nIts worth the money. Its worth the few short hours of playtime.

(This is actually a confusing thing to call a pro. There are those, myself included, who prefers hard games with a lot of challenge.\n\nThe cons:\n- A little repetitive, but either way, the game is short.\n- Some confusing detection mechanics, where the mob sees you, but donÂ´t see at all (still havenÂ´t gotten the trick on this).\n- The lack of a map makes you get lost in some maps, without knowing each way you went the first time. Sum on this the repetitive screens on the levels.\n\nI reccomend the game, itÂ´s not expensive and itÂ´s assured fun even if for just a little time.","October 20, 2015","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Doing so nets you a big score which grants you higher experience points that allows you to level up your characters statistics. When you level up, more strategic options become available to you.

The game also lacks any real polish in its mechanics, so issues arise any time the game moves between real-time and turn-based time. For example: attack too late and your sword swing misses and the enemy detects you, move too late and enemies detect you behind a wall or outside their vision range.\n\nObviously it's a mobile port, so the game isn't terribly complicated. Don't expect to distract enemies with anything other than meat, and don't expect alternate routes or strategies. Some things are questionable for a mobile game as well - clicking on an empty space will move your character towards that space, but the game is not smart enough to understand that clicking on an enemy or breakable means move and attack.\n\nWait for a sale.","August 9, 2015","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was brilliantly simple and very well designed. The gameplay is ULTRA tight and refined. The art style is extremely clean and pleasent and the overall game is exactly as long (or rather: as short) as it needs to be. Sneaky Sneaky doesn't overstay it's welcome. The storyline is extremely simple but at the same time, it is the essence of a more complex story. Like the rest of the game, it is only the most important elements of a story.\n\nI've recommended quite a few games but this one in particular I would say is an essential play. Sneaky Sneaky represents what I believe to be a game that is the most well distilled, honed and perfected title I've seen since Portal 1. Sneaky Sneaky is exactly what it should have been from start to finish and there is nothing else that it needs to be.\n\nIts worth the money. Its worth the few short hours of playtime.
