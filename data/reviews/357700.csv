No - does it manage to be some awesome fun? Absolutely! The game is early access and from what I can tell is lacking content, but that's to be expected from an early access game. It's actually very, very fun though and as long as development goes smoothly from here on out, should shape up to be the great game it looks like it's going to be. If you are ok with being an early bird in a game like this, I would highly recommend it.\n\nI've tried every character, but I spent very little time with the melee guy. Every character felt genuinely unique. Each character has a "limiter" of sorts to stop them from putting out endless DPS. The generic shooter guy has to reload, and thus plays much like you'd expect a generic shooter guy to: small engagements, reloading inbetween, etc... He was very fun though, don't get me wrong. He is clearly meant to be the "basic" class of the game, but manages to do so with finesse.\n\nThe sniper girl also plays like you'd expect: She wants to engage as few enemies as possible at once and does extremely high single (or few) target damage. Some of the later levels have large enemy swarms and I haven't made it that far with her yet, but I imagine she is VERY difficult as the game goes on. She was very fun though. Her gimmick is that she needs to charge her shots up, and can "overcharge" to do extra damage. She ♥♥♥♥ing DESTROYS bosses.\n\nThe melee guy, as I said, I didn't mess with much. It was difficult to deal damage with him without taking damage in return. His gimmick is that his weapon can overheat and be rendered unusable if spammed for too long.\n\nThe robot is by far my favorite character. It has amazing stats all around and a shield to absorb damage before losing health, but to deal damage drains an energy bar that slowly fills up. You can switch between 3 modes that charge your shield bar faster, your weapon bar faster, or split charge power equally. You HAVE to switch to do well, trust me. It's a very fun character though.\n\nThe game has a fun unlock system for content, but as I said, there doesn't appear to be a ton of content as of yet. But early access is early access. If you like roguelites and sci-fi, this is a fantastic game.","September 15, 2015","true","4.0"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","17","17","2","1"

How? Basically just kill the hell outta everything that doesn't look human. Rogue Continuum feels like a game that was built for a group of friends/players, all the features seem to lean towards this idea. From the distinct and unique four characters, upgrades, non-stop action this game is all about laughing manically as you blow crap up all around you with your friends. For the most part Rogue Continuum accomplishes this but the experience becomes different when playing alone. Some classes are best used in combination with others, leaving them feeling very under powered when the hordes of aliens come for your lonesome warrior. All the game really needs is some balance, which is what Early Access is all about. So I am sure this won't be an issue for long. Other features like Online play will solve this issue once it's in place as well. The graphics are sharp and have plenty of over the top explosions, and huge aliens. While Rogue Continuum brings it's roguelike elements to the table, one thing that I loved is that it really is simple to just pick up and play. This is a no fuss type of game, just shoot stuff and use your cool powers, collect loot, kill more stuff. It's just that simple.\n\nI made a video preview to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\nhttps://youtu.be/kRM8BtpEBak\nI hope you enjoy!\nMartyr","September 16, 2015","true","1.3"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","9","10","2","0"

Reminds me a lot of Nuclear Throne in the little while I've played. The sniper is probably my favorite class, but I warmed up with the gunner; looking forward to going back to try him out now that I understand the mechanics a little more. It seems like a pretty straight forward title, I can't wait until they add the online coop since I very rarely play couch coop. I think it'll benefit a lot from that addition, but only if they add it soonish. If not, this will fall by the wayside like to many other roguelikes.","September 15, 2015","true","0.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","6","6","3","0"

It's easy enough to catch and there is nothing technial to complain about so far.\n\n+ local couch potato co-op\n+ wireless / wired xb360 controller working\n+ developers are active within the forums\n\n- no online multiplayer yet\n\n22.09\n+++ developers are in fact deeply in love with the common couch potato. I may consider naming my first born Rogue Continuum if this EA is going to continue like that\n\n15.12\nPlayed the new patch today, pretty much liked the overall changes.\nThe medkit issue is resolved and the lower the player hp actually is the more likely a medkit will spawn.\nDestructo (tank) feels a little nerfed, but as much as it pains me to say a deserved one as he was a bit über before.  I certainly hope the 3rd and 4th ability of each char will be added soon, can't wait for Sam's T-Rex.\nI am afraid the community support is a little thin. I very much would like a tiny bit of information on the ongoing process. Not a hand written essay or chinese prosa but something similar to a quick roadmap.\n\nSlowly gets better and certainly could become a great game.","September 16, 2015","true","5.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In game progression feels like Risk of Rain with different worlds to explore and many items to aquire. Persistent RPG style progression gives small permanent improvements. Level and enemy design is varied, 4 characters all have distinct playstyles, and lots of fun can be had with friends or solo. Online is coming soon, and when it does I expect to play an awful lot of this game.","September 22, 2015","true","4.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
