The concept is simple enough, but the execution is high quality.\n\nThe game is basically a 3rd person shooter in which you have to defend a magical rift in a castle from a horde of orcs and other monsters that are trying to get through it. If too many monsters make it to the rift you lose.\n\nOne man against a relentless horde of monsters may not seem fair, but you have a lot of advantages. In addition to your trusty crossbow, you'll have a large arsenal of spells, traps, and guardians to help out. Furthermore you earn skulls for completing levels, and you can then spend these skulls on further upgrading your arsenal.\n\nAt the start of each level you'll have time to plan and set up your defenses and get a feel for the layout of the area. You'll be told where the orcs are coming from, what route they are likely to take, how many waves there are, and even what monsters you can expect to come knocking down your door.\n\nThis is important because, despite the simple premise of "orcs must die," this is really a tactician's game. The first few levels you may be able to survive using just your crossbow, but as the difficulty level increases you will have to diversify your tactics or perish. You'll start facing more orcs, tougher monsters, monsters that come from multiple entrances, and even multiple rifts that must be defended simultaneously.\n\nI will give one bit of warning that is not mentioned in the game-- if you intend to play on the default (war mage) difficulty level as I did, in order to earn the maximum of 5 skulls per level you not only need to prevent any orcs from reaching the rift, you've also got to do it within the par time. Once you start the initial wave the timer starts, and it doesn't stop even during the "break" periods you sometimes get between waves.\n\nThe game is single player only. The graphics and music are adequate, but not AAA quality (this is an indie game, after all, and I don't expect AAA quality here).\n\nThere is a storyline which is short, simple, and entertaining. Borderlands fans will recognize the voice of Axton the Commando as the War Mage.\n\nIf you like third person shooters or defense-centered gameplay you'll like Orcs Must Die!","November 15, 2013","true","26.4"," 89 of 98 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","89","98","0","0"

It's smooth, colorful, bloody, violent and pretty damn difficult at times.  It's a lot like a single player Dungeon Defenders.  Removing the multiplayer makes it easier to see whats going on, and allows for more creative thinking.  Each new level, trap and ability you unlock will leave you thirsty for more and more Orc blood!\n\nThe traps are extremely divers and fun to experiment with.  Some combos work better than others, and some strategies are easier for different people.\n\nThe pace of the game will keep you on your toes, and the learning curve is well balanced.  With the constant addition of new enemies and new traps, your tactic will have to change throughout the game.\n\nIts a good length for the content as well.  If it was longer, it would feel drawn out or not leave enough room for omd2.\n\nOver all, this game is a lot of fun and worth buying – on sale!  I only stress that this is bought on sale because you can play all of the omd maps on omd2 – with or without a friend.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=7261685","March 31, 2014","true","11.6"," 28 of 31 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","28","31","0","0"

This game is not just an RPG but also a strategy one.\n\nIt is a tower defense game, basically, but as opposed to the usual top-down approach this game uses a third person perspective. It is an interesting choice but certainly makes the game convenient to play. The rest is the usual stuff: the orc waves are getting more and more difficult and the player unlocks more types of traps. Oh, and of course, on later levels we have to look out for more areas as the enemies can approach our base from several directions.\n\nIf you are bothered by the fact that one single orc reached your base and because of that you lost a couple of points you are free to replay all previous levels for better results. This replayability and the dozens of available levels make sure OMD is a long-lasting experience. At the time of writing this review the game has a 75% discount and its GOTY edition certainly is a catch for just 2 euros.","August 2, 2014","true","2.4"," 25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","25","28","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/genoforprez/recommended/102600/","genoforprez","genoforprez","http://steamcommunity.com/id/genoforprez/","385 products in account","This is a really great and fun tower defense game mixed with real-time action game... once you get the hang of it. Not to imply that it isn't fun right out of the gate, but it doesn't take very long for you to sort of realize that the game wants to be played in a very particular way, and if you aren't picking up the game's hints, it can get frustrating. There are frankly a lot of things about this game that are VERY USEFUL INFORMATION that it doesn't do a particularly good job of explaining to you. Here are just a few examples of things that are confusing and will drive players to consult ye olde Google:\n\n1. How in the hell does the skull system work...???\n2. I'm kicking a** and no orcs are getting into the rift, but I keep getting low scores...???\n3. I have no idea what I'm supposed to do with this steam trap...???\n\nHere are the short versions to those answers:\n\n1. For 5 skulls, beat the level, get lots of combos, don't lose any rift points, and beat the mysterious "target time" that you have no idea exists or what the specific target time is unless you finish the level and select "statistics" from the end-of-level options then look for the fine print.\n\n2. Combos. It's not enough to just kill all the orcs and keep them away from the rift. You have to kill lots of orcs simultaneously, really fast, as much as possible.\n\n3. The steam trap is a worthless piece of crap that does nothing useful (and it's not the only one). Just ignore it.\n\nIf you want to head down the path of victory instead of the path of what-the-hell-is-going-on, then here is where you should start:\n\n1. Wind Bracers\n2. Archers\n3. Tar pits\n4. Barricades\n6. Ice amulet\n7. Steel Weaver -> Death Augmenter\n\nYou'll unlock these as you progress, but those are probably the most useful traps in the game. Orcs plodding slowly through a snaking trail of tar while 15 archers fire flaming arrows at them simultaneously? While you simultaneously use the bracers to blow huge crowds of them into a lava/acid pit? Victory.\n\nYou'll pick up more tricks and variations as you go. Swinging mace trap + tar pits = virtually unstoppable. Expensive, but heavenly.\n\nAre fliers a problem? Or maybe ogres? Or maybe hunters? ICE AMULET THOSE A-HOLES.\n\nIt's really fun once you get the feel for it and find the optimal strategies, but aspects of the game can definitely feel mysterious and frustrating at first.\n\nI'm just three levels away from 5-skulling the entire game. It's been a good time.","April 22, 2015","true","45.2"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","91","21","23","4","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrivateGodfrey/recommended/102600/","PrivateGodfrey","Captain MooMoos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrivateGodfrey/","490 products in account","This is a long review so if you want just a brief summary of why I recommend Orcs Must Die! then skip to Results and read from there.\n\nRobot Entertainment mixes elements of different game types to conjure up a brilliant rendition of the tower defense genre. Taking action packed battles and mixing them with strategy you get a game that pushes both hack ‘n slash as well as base management.\n\nStory:\nThe order has fallen, the last War Mage is dead, and protecting the realm is now left up to you his apprentice. You must fight your way through the unlimited hordes of orcs as you defend the rifts from falling into the wrong hands. As you press through your adventure you come to learn the evil forces are being led by a corrupted War Mage who plans to destroy humanity. Will you be able to save the world from falling into darkness?\n\nCampaign:\nThe campaign is broken down into three acts. The first act has ten levels, the second act has 8, and the third act has 6. Despite each act having fewer levels than the last they are all about the same length as the number of waves increases throughout the campaign. Each level unlocks a new element to the game and once you’ve completed the level you gain the new item for any preceding or future level. Each time you beat a level you get a rating of one to five skulls, unlike most games these skulls actually are given to you as a currency which you can use to upgrade items. You can only get five skulls per level, meaning you cannot beat a level scoring five skulls then play it again to get another five skulls. Each level you can choose from a mastery tree that allows you to kit yourself out for that level, based on your strategies this can vary greatly throughout the campaign. You will progressively unlock more tower/item slots, which start as you only being able to equip three towers/items but later on you’ll find yourself with 10+ slots. You play the entire game in third person, and similar to other games of the genre you are able to join in the battle and help your towers out. This means you are not just sitting there waiting between waves, but rather taking an active part into the gameplay. Some levels you may find yourself not needing to join in, while others you will be right in the fray.\n\nGameplay:\nEach level allows you to equip an inventory which allows you to choose from a combination of spells, weapons, and towers. There are two weapons (crossbow and bladestaff), four spells (flame bracers, ice amulet, lightning ring, and wind belt), two guardians (paladins and archers), and 17 towers. I found myself typically sticking to the same set throughout the entire campaign, but there are many different strategies you can go for. By placing player activated traps you can take a large part of the game, you can sit back and use guardians to do most of the work, or even mix and match. The gameplay is fast paced and really pulls you into the mix by getting you to experience new elements each level.\n\nArtifacts of Power DLC:\nArtifacts of Power is a DLC that includes new items and towers. The DLC includes two traps (Shock Zapper and Floor Scorcher) and two spells (Vampiric Gauntlets and Alchemist Satchel). I used the Floor Scorcher and Vampiric Gauntlets a few times, found the Shock Zapper completely useless (as you need a roof for it to function), and used the Alchemist Satchel to get a +50 kill streak for the achievement. All and all this DLC isn’t exactly necessary, but if you can get it on sale and included in the pack it’s worth grabbing.\n\nLost Adventures DLC:\nLost Adventures is a DLC that includes new level, enemies, and even a new tower. There are five new levels, which offer more skulls allowing for even more upgrades. There are two new enemies the Frost Bat, and Cyclops Mage. It also includes one new trap the mana well which allows you to refill your mana gauge. This DLC is completely worth it as it adds additional content, new enemies, towers, and refined leaderboards. If you can get this on sale or in the bundle you will not regret it.\n\nResults:\nOrcs Must Die is an epic tower defense hack ‘n slash game that keeps you pressed and wanting more. With rating systems that actually give you rewards, fun and interesting enemies, a long and arduous campaign, and an amusing little story Orcs Must Die is a Must Buy (too easy). If you are looking for something similar to Sang-Froid or Sanctum this is pretty much in that line. Once you beat Orcs Must Die you’ll feel like you need to buy the second one as it makes you just want to play more.\n\nPros:\n+Leaderboard system that allows you to rank yourself amongst friends.\n+Level rating out of five skulls which can then be used to buy upgrades.\n+Loads of spells, weapons, and towers to choose from.\n+Skill trees which can be customized each level to allow you to change how you play (more player intensive, tower support, or mixture of both).\n+Smooth graphics which look good and don’t push it too far.\n+Funny and amusing dialogue which gives you a laugh without being offensive.\n+Intense amount of action, keeps you pressed and fighting between each wave.\n+Built in level traps (such as rolling locks, acid pots, lava pots, and ballista).\n\nCons:\n-I had a few levels glitch where an enemy wouldn’t leave the spawn point and thus I couldn’t kill it requiring me to restart (this was annoying if it was at the end of the level).\n-If Gnoll Hunters fall into acid pits they do not die (as I learned when I set up a level that used nearby acid pits to kill enemies).\n-One of the DLC levels (Reverse Tower) is just The Tower in Reverse. I know this is obvious from the title, but if you purchase the DLC before playing the game its disappointing to find out one of the levels is the same thing just backwards.","April 27, 2014","true","17.5"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","18","19","0","0"

I refused to let it go until I beat it on the hardest difficulty and got all the achievements. I give this game five skulls (and a horned helmet to boot)!\nA fun, addictive, and enjoyable experience that keeps on giving.\nOrcs Must Die! is not the type to focus on its lore or story more than it's necessary. There's a legion of baddies out there and it's up to you and your ridiculously generous array of traps, weapons and spells to stop them. The simple and funny cinematics and voice acting cover the rest. The protagonist is witty, easy-going, wise-cracking, and arrogant to the point of annoyance. And as such, I lovingly refer to him as Bruce Campbell.\n\nThe HUD and menus are minimalistic and have been built for easy and simple navigation with a gamepad. Even so, using a keyboard is in no way inconvenient especially when considering that all of the action is paused while looking through the menus.\n\nThe graphics are in no way elaborate or any form of high definition but they are far from being poor or shoddy. Considering the high level of action and running around required, they are quite appropriate as nobody wants to have to restart a mission because they got overrun by orcs while looking at the pretty walls. The sound effects fit with the visual style amazingly well, the music is very fun and needs a lot of time for the repetitiveness to become annoying, which sadly cannot be said by the quippy voice acting which does get old pretty fast.\n\nThe controls rarely feel awkward and only become a problem for perfectionists (such as myself) who wish to align all their traps perfectly. The heat of battle on higher difficulties makes for split-second perfect placement which when failed might require users to restart the mission. The Options menu is quite modest but fitting to the purpose of Orcs Must Die!. The Achievements don't ask too much from the user and completionists will get almost all of them by the end. In regards to the Leaderboards, some of the higher scoring users got there with cheats that allowed absurd numbers but ranking among friends works just fine and in real time.\n\nI installed Orcs Must Die! and played through the first two difficulties with a constant smile on my face, pretty much bewitched by the fun combination of traps and spells I could use during each mission.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/antwog/recommended/102600/","antwog","Antwog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/antwog/","192 products in account","Orcs Must Die! Is a first-person tower defence game developed and published by Robot Entertainment. It was released in October 2011. You play as a War Mage that defends his rift, or base, against the enemy orcs and fellow allies. In the first-person aspect, your War Mage has weapons that you use against the enemy and you construct defences to defend your Rift. This game is purely single-player. This review will cover the overall concept in regards to story and downloadable content, gameplay, and to a smaller extent, performance.\n\nOrcs Must Die features a simple concept with an easy learning curve. The simple concept is tower defence and there is no tutorial because you place units to defend and should not require assistance. This game features 25 base game missions with 5 separate missions through the Lost Adventures DLC and there is a small story attached to the base game missions. The DLC contained new units and new levels, so while there is a passable amount of content, for $2.99 it does no harm. There is three difficulties so this game has enough replayability for 25 hours. Regarding the story, I did not overly understand the actual story at hand because it was not emphasised. The start of each level had the War Mage advancing the unclear story such as him being alone in the mages and having to defend against the enemy. There were around three cut scenes in the entire base game missions that succulently revealed the story but without those, the attached story was unclear and an afterthought. If the story was emphasised more through cut scenes this game would have been better. Moving on, each level is different and vary in difficulty, providing a new experience with most of the levels. For instance, as one level progressed it increased in difficulty. As the missions progressed, it became harder in difficulty. Therefore, I praise the level designs that are neat and add diversity and fun towards the game. As for enjoyment, I enjoyed the missions and the overall concept and style for the most part, but levels started to become stale and therefore, were becoming boring but luckily I finished all missions on easy difficulty without being burnt out.\n\nThe gameplay is basic and has a large amount of variety. The gameplay aspect is a wave begins and your units and your player beat the enemy, gaining income to spend on other units or upgrades. There is a very nice variety of units because there is a total of 30 units and weapons, and while I used the same eight for each mission there were other options at least. One feature is the upgrade tree, which is three different trees with different abilities and the player chooses one per level. You spend your currency you gain from killing enemies on unlocking abilities in the tree through a vertical skillset approach, which is you unlock skill one, then you can unlock skill 2 and so forth. For instance, one skill may be reducing the reload times for timed units. I like this but I believe its unbalanced because for 29 missions I used only one tree and the other mission I used another one, as that particular tree I mainly used drastically improved the powers of my units. Another system is the upgrading of abilities and/or reducing the cost of your units after the levels by using skulls. For instance, upgrading archer guardians would reduce the price from 600 coins to 500 coins. This proves incredibly useful because of the course of the level, as things get harder, you need stronger units. The game makes the little things count, such as witty comments from your War Mage to the sweet killing animations, providing a light-hearted atmosphere. Furthermore, the artwork is very nice with its cartoon approach that freshens the games apperance. The one main issue I had with the gameplay was the generic movements by the AI and their lack of animation in attacking and rushing. For instance, I felt that each unit lacked diversity in movement and animation because the ogres have different clothing and names but all have the same animations and movements. This is the same with the orcs and the flying units. It gets repetitive as well because you get the feeling its like 'oh, the ogre is charging at me again'. The other small issue was the pathfinding bugs with enemies, but not a major issue.\n\nThe performance was consistent and is optimised. I could play on max settings at 60+ FPS. This is not a big deal but just thought I would mention it.\n\nOrcs Must Die is a solid game. It benefits from the simplicity and diversity of the game in enemy characters, units and the basic nature of defending against multiple waves of enemies. It suffers from the lack of animation and movement in enemy, that makes the game repetitive and towards staleness. The story is very disappointing as it is an afterthought, though it has its small moments. The artwork and gameplay is neat and light-hearted and the overall atmosphere of the game matches this description. I completed the game in eight hours and this was an appropriate length because I was close to being bored. But, I enjoyed it for the most part because of the simplicity. Furthermore,  has its pros and cons and is a solid game, however, it does not stretch into being a good game. At $12.99 for the game of the year edition, I recommend it on sale. It’s a fun game that is casual and easy to play but there is not enough fresh content to play this for twenty hours.\n\nRatings system:\nFor this particular game, I will rate the concept and gameplay judging from what I wrote and average those scores. I will then range the score to what I felt it should be given.\n\nConcept: 6.5/10\nGameplay: 5.5/10\nOverall: 5.5/10\n\nThanks for reading my review!

Attributes of both genres are blended together perfectly to form an addictive and entertaining little game. This is a game that is very easy to enjoy.\n\nOrcs Must Die!  does a great job taking 3rd-person action elements and blending them with some tower defense to establish a good basis. Then they sprinkle in the lighthearted atmosphere and charming characters with the simplistic-yet-captivating mechanics of the game… and it shapes up to be a really fun, delightful experience. It’s definitely the kind of game you can dive right into and get hooked for hours.\n\nThere is a relatively large amount of different towers and abilities in the game when compared to many other games in the tower defense genre. You have plenty of options and can have fun experimenting with different strategies. The level designs also vary enough that they call for different approaches to beat them, so you will have to try out different tactics in order to succeed. And there is a fair amount of different enemies which keeps things fresh as you progress through the game.\n\nThere is also a scoring system and leaderboards to add replay value.\n\nThis game is just downright fun.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","November 18, 2013","true","23.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

First person tower defense is nothing new but it is how solid and streamlined Orcs Must Die feels that makes it stand apart from it's competitors.\n\nYou are the last of the War Mages, not the brightest, not the strongest, just the last one. And you are all that stands between the peasants of the land living in an idyllic medieval utopia and being introduced to the business end of a rusty axe. To stem the tide of orcs pouring in through magical portals you must progress to a succession of levels killing increasingly larger and more diverse waves of enemies. To help you on this task you have your trusty crossbow and variety of traps and magic.\n\nYou start each level by choosing which traps and weapons you want to use, completing missions unlocks more and completing them well allows you to upgrade them. As you slay orcs you earn gold which can then be used to place more traps or to gain various in-mission upgrades. As the levels progress you are introduced to all the classic tower defense enemies, the fast runners, the big slow damage sponges, the attackers that run straight for you, the suicide bombers that can kill your barricades, the fliers that follow completely separate paths from their ground dwelling kin and every other enemy that has been in every other tower defense game to date.\n\nGraphically the games goes for a sort of cartoonish look that works fairly well most of the time and the music does the job equally adequate. The various juvenile one liners being spouted by your character grows tiresome rather quickly however.\n\nThere really isn't much to set Orcs Must Die apart from any of the other tower defense games out there, it does everything they do and never strays too far from the path of tried and true. What makes it shine however, is how extremely solid it all is. No action is wasted and every item in the game feels like it serves a purpose. The gameplay is tight and satisfying and although the nature of the genre makes it repeat itself quite a lot as you reach the higher difficulties it manages to maintain a longer lifespan than most tower defense games.\n\nAll in all Orcs Must Die is your standard first person tower defense game, extremely well made and a must have for any fans of the genre but not a game that will attract any newcomers or a game that brings anything new to the genre. A tried and true fomular, executed solidly.","May 31, 2013","true","94.6"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

You play as the War Mage, who's job is to kill Orcs, often in rather comical ways.  In each level, the Orcs will spawn in waves and try to enter the rift and it's your job to kill them.  This done via laying traps, using weapons, or placing guardians to fight by your side.  After each level, you will be given a new power to use and skulls based on how well you did; the less Orcs that make it through the rift and the faster you do it, the more skulls you earn.  These skulls can then be spent on upgrades for your traps and guardians.\n\nAfter many hours of gameplay and tens of thousands of Orcs slain, I can safety say that this game IS FREAKING AWESOME.  I've sunk about 45 hours into this game (counting the dlc missions).  Let that sink in: 45 hours of gameplay!  There are triple A games out there that give a fraction of gametime with several times the cost.  It's a steal, esspecially if you can get on sale.\n\nHowever, this game is about exactly one thing: killing Orcs.  Beyond that, there's really nothing else to do, but for its price, its a hard deal to beat.  If your own the fence, try the demo or watch some clips on youtube.  And if you like what you see, buy it.  Especially if you can get the entire series bundled and discounted.\n\nTLDR: 10/10\n\nDisclaimer: No Orcs were harmed in the writing of this review.

It is the second game made by Robot Entertainment whose studio is made up of people from the now defunct Ensemble Studios. Why is that significant? Well at one point in my life I was a console gamer, I won't go into specifics because those were dark times filled with low framerates, but I digress. The game that I played the most on xbox was Halo Wars which was developed by Ensemble. Being the amazing devs they are, they have yet again impressed me with Orcs Must Die! The objective of the game is to stop orcs from reaching the rift(s) on each level by placing traps and using weapons. Each level has multiple waves of orcs that increase in difficulty over the rounds and if enough orcs enter the rift(s) the rift score drops to zero and you lose. The plot of the game is surprisingly interesting aswell since you play as a War Mage who is the last member of an order dedicated to defending the rifts which are sources of magic for the two worlds. I think they could have gone more in depth with the story even though this is a somewhat silly game.\n\nVerdict   -   Well worth the time and money.\n\nBTW   -   This is better than that Rift mmo.","August 7, 2014","true","8.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The rift is basically a portal from the orcs world to the human world, if too many orcs make it through the portal, the game is lost.\n\nYou start off with a few simple traps, a sword, and the always equipped crossbow. But as you get further into the game you will unlock new traps and eventually upgrade your traps with skulls, which are unlocked depending on how well you do in a level. As you progress through the game you will unlock more slots to equip different traps, these are kept if you go back to a previous level, which you might not have done so well on (or maybe you did really well and are replaying it because it's so much fun).\n\nAt the beginning of each level the game tells you where the orcs will come from, the route they will take and the types of enemies you will encounter during that level. The levels are divided into waves, the gap between waves is really a quick break in which you have time to place some traps with the money you have collected protecting that rift.\n\nLevels are only short which makes it a great game to fill in time whilst having fun. The art style is also great and fits perfectly with the gameplay, and some of the cheeky comments the War Mage makes. The soundtrack is really upbeat and part of what makes you so happy playing this game.\n\nThe only downside to this game is that, unlike its sequel, it is only single player.\n\nBut overall Orc Must Die is a great game for any casual gamer, especially those that are fans of both the action and strategy genres.","December 25, 2013","true","4.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I am an avid tower defense gamer; there is just something undeniably satisfying about stoping someone from reaching their goal.... its actually kind of sick really. This brings an intresting change of pace. The humor is pretty engaging, I find myself eager with each new level to hear what kind of quip the War Mage will say. The traps are creative and encourage you to find new ways to supress the Orcs. Will your bombard them with Archers while they are arduously walking through a tar pit, or perhaps you would like to take them on yourself while cattle them into a grinder. Whatever menacingly creative way you wish to protect the rift, this game has something for you.\n\nPlay it if : You love tower defense (I assure you, you won't be dissapointed)\nAvoid it if: You are an Orc Lover, You are not creative, or obviously if you don't like tower defense\n\n9/10 in my book\nThe only thing holding it back is no mutiplayer, but the second game remedied that issue","November 10, 2015","true","11.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","2","2","3","0"

In many ways, it's similar to Dungeon Defenders (see previous review), but you play as only one character and there is no customization, other than what traps you decide to use on each level. That doesn't make it bad, however. In fact, it's a real plus in the game's favor... as the main character is, well, quite a character! I guarantee his goofy lines will bring a smile to your face. Gameplay is standard fare for the genre - progress through a series of levels in which you must set up traps and defend your magic rift from hordes of orcs. Every new level completed adds a new trap or ally to your arsenal, making for a smooth progression (though nothing is ever really a cakewalk). You will be challenged, for sure... especially on later levels. If you're looking for a new tower defense game (or maybe looking to try one for the first time), Orcs Must Die is about as solid as they come.

Being a fan of the Orc race myself in video games, it was enjoyable to slaughter thousands of goofy Orcs as they rushed towards you in the many different levels this game's storyline had. Many different games these days have vast differences in graphical designs, yet this game struck a good balance between keeping it simple and looking good at the same time. The same goes for the different skins and models available throughout the game.\n\nThe cutscenes explaining the storyline are a bit short, and lacking information at times, but the idea of this game is pretty straightforward; you kill Orcs. Lots and lots of Orcs. You've got many different ways to do it, all ending up in the brutal slaughter of Orcs. There are many different contrapments and weapons to help you along the way.

But Orcs must die sets a new level in this genre.\nCombining a 3rd person action game with tower defence, it created the ultimate action survival game.\nSet in a fictional fantasy universe, you have to defend humanity against hordes of orcs from another dimension. For that, they built big fortress' around the portals, you have to defend.\n\nFor that, you not only have weapons and spells, but a big arsenal of traps and mechanical defend systems, from ordinary spike traps to big swinging clubs, burning pits and big brutal mechanical grinders.\nEvery level is made of one or several floors with one or several directions the enemys can spawn. You have to defend the rifts to the normal world, so the orcs dont conquer it.\n\nUsing the right collection of traps, wisly using your abilitys and being a tactical genius desides about victory and defeat. The game doesnt take you lightly. With the first levels being easily understandable and mostly fast to solve, some maps are difficult beyond everything encountered before. Some maps need tricks you have to find out all by yourself, some just need you to be fast like sonic, defending two rifts at once.\n\nHaving a small storyline, mostly living from comedy, the campaign is really fun to play. After one playthrough you unlock another difficulty, that is a serious challenge (and was a real pain for me).\n\nIt isnt a real game for casual players, but a good game, for tacticans, that not only want to think but slay their way through their enemys.","February 5, 2015","true","154.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

That one sentence is actually all you have to know about the game with the same title. It's a mixture between tower defense and an kind of action-rpg, where you have to prevent orcs and all their fellow companions like ogres, flying wyvern, and all that good stuff to enter the portals to the outer world. To do this, you have to... kill them. Of course.\n\nStory:\nIf you actually want to play this game because of the story, you're considering buying the wrong game. There is basically no story, except if you call that little bit of dialoges between the hero and the villain a story. They're fun to listen to, as mentioned below aswell, but nothing special. Just the regular "evil person wants to destroy the world, hero has to stop her"-story.\n2/10, but f*ck that, that's not what makes the game the great game it is, so read on.\n\nGameplay:\nBefore starting a game, you have to decide which items you want to use. There are about 25 different defense elements and 5 weapons for the player, such as a lightning ring, an ice ring or a blade, and of course the crossbow, which is your standard weapon.\nThen, after having built your line of defence, you enter "G" and the actual fun begins. Orcs and other creatures come and run to the portal (or portals, as you have multiple ones to protect on higher maps). Depending on your build you'll have to do more or less yourself, while your defence units are killing the mobs.\nThere are three difficulties, one for beginners, "Warmage-Difficulty" (which is the standard one) and "Nightmare-Difficulty", which you unlock after beating the game on Warmage-Difficulty. On nightmare, you have only 3 seconds before the game begins, then you can't stop it anymore, so you have to think fast and play fast. There's actually skill required.\n9.5/10\n\nGraphics:\nThe game is not the newest. It hasn't got high-end graphics, but I like the comic-style of the art design. It's playful, fun, and excentrical. It fits perfectly to the game and to the main character, who's a little bit narcisstic, sarcastic and feels over-the-top, which makes him super fun.\n7/10\n\nSound/Music:\nThe entire sound is great. While fighting, there's a mixture of rock/metal music with old, somehow medieval music playing. It's fast, it's hard, it rocks, it's just excellent if you like this kind of music.\nIf you headshot enemies, there sometimes might be special e-guitar riffs played, which makes them quite satisfying.\nThe monsters sometimes may comment your actions or say stupid things like "why does his crossbow shoot 1000 times a second?" with ultra-stupid voices, which makes them REALLY fun to listen to. Also, they make somehow fun of themselfes, which fits into the concept of Orcs Must Die! pretty well aswell.\nThe hero - the Warmage - is nice voice acted and sometimes also comments the action going on on the screen in his sarcastic way. Pretty fun aswell.\nThe villain is nice voice acted aswell, and the dialoges between her and the Warmage are in most of the cases really fun to listen to.\n10/10, definitely.\n\nOverall:\nOrcs Must Die! is a great tower defense game. It's fun, challenging, entertaining, humorous, and hours fly by like a few seconds when playing it. I love it.\n36.5/40 (as story isn't important, if you want to consider it, you get a 38.5/50; but trust me, it's a 50/50 for me personally.)","May 18, 2014","true","33.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Girlbeard/recommended/102600/","Girlbeard","Girlbeard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Girlbeard/","661 products in account","Horrendously good fun. My main grievance is that the Warmage (the protagonist) is a complete idiot and the game takes every opportunity to beat you over the head with that fact. Fortunately you can mute the game so you don't have to listen to him. Another small issue I had was that there are occasionally little nuggets of exposition during the game, but you can barely hear them over the sound of orc giblets spraying across the level.\n\nPutting those issues aside the game rewards you with an army of orcs and associates to slaughter your way through with a variety of pokey, burny, zappy and crushy things. The score system gives you an incentive to go back to earlier levels with your new toys and make orcs die in new and interesting ways. You can approach each level in a variety of ways, so if you prefer setting up a death alley and watching the carnage from afar you can do so. But if you prefer getting up close and personal with a blade whilst a tar pit slows your enemies down, that's a valid option. Later in the game you unlock 'Weavers', giving you mid-game temporary upgrades for your traps and skills which add to the number of strategies you can use.\n\nI didn't have any technical issues with the game although on an older machine the game did slow down a little when a lot of enemies were around, but otherwise it runs well.\n\nOverall I'd recommend it to tower defense fanatics as well as action or strategy game fans.","July 21, 2014","true","17.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Orcs Must Die is one of those games. From the moment you start playing, its slick presentation becomes very apparent, ranging from a charming artstyle, to nice fast-paced music, and a comedic tone.\n\nBut presentation is not the only thing where the game shines. As a tower defence game it has some pretty ingenious trap ideas, such as trapdoors that release scorching flames, spring pads that launch orcs into the air, as well as acid bombs and even knights and archers. The level designs are also very well made, at times providing very obvious spots for where traps are ideal. And in addition to traps, you also unlock weavers, which are sorceresses that provide you with passive skills for the duration of the level. Upgrading these skills makes either your abilities or your traps/guardians more effective at what they do.\n\nAt the end of each level, you get a score (which is shown against scores of people on your friends list) and a rating out of 5 skulls. You can then use the skulls to upgrade some of your traps.\n\nOverall the game was loads of fun. I've had a blast. Perhaps the only minor criticism I have is that when starting a new level that has more than 1 enemy entrances, it's often impossible to tell where the enemy is going to come through first. But it's a very small nitpick. The game is fun. If you like tower defence genre, get it now.","September 23, 2015","true","23.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Slaughtering orcs, trolls, goblins, and other mobs is hugely satisfying, especially when racking up combos and abusing skill trees and environmental traps.\n\nThe game's only flaw is that the hardest difficulty, Nightmare mode, is a bit on the unfun side, as it immediately starts all attack waves automatically, removing the element of careful planning. If you're a completionist aiming to 5-star every level, be prepared for the tedium of restarting every single level dozens and dozens of times from scratch until that one magical run where nothing goes wrong.\n\nAside from that, highly recommended game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/102600/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","975 products in account","Quick Summary: Orcs Must Die is a combination of third person action and tower/trap defense, similar to Sanctum but with humor and medieval weaponry. The game is a lot of fun, but unlike the sequel, there’s no co-op gameplay :(\n\nYou take on the role of a cocky student war mage trying to hold back the onslaught of orcs coming through into our world. The hero is pretty dumb, but fortunately the orcs are even dumber and their paths through each level are almost completely predictable. With your magic traps and artifacts (for casting spells) you need to make sure as few orcs as possible get to the end of the level and enter the rift (sometimes there’s more than one rift to defend).\n\nThe game is broken up into individual levels, each with a different map, and on each map can be multiple orc entrances and exit rifts. At the start of each level you are given unlimited time to run around and see the layout, as well as set up your loadout (which traps or spells you can use during the level). Once you’ve started the game you cannot change your loadout, you’d have to restart the whole level. You have a ton of traps to choose from, although a few of them aren’t much use and you’ll likely be sticking with the basics like wall arrows, tar pits, and barricades for most of the game. You’ll be facing only a few different kinds of orcs (fast runners, arrow shooters, ogres), but they’ll be coming in large numbers so the key to beating each level is channeling the orcs into choke points where you can use fewer numbers of traps. The traps cost money so you can’t just fill the map with them (and unlike many other tower defense games, you cannot upgrade the traps during the levels).\n\nThe biggest difference though between Orcs Must Die and traditional tower defense is the fact that you the hero are on site blasting enemies alongside your traps. You’re armed with a reasonably powerful rapid fire crossbow that’s able to kill small numbers of the slow moving orcs, or the really fast runners that die in one shot. Your traps usually have cooldown times so you cannot rely on them to catch every orc. For example, a spike trap might only trigger every 5 seconds, and during those 5 seconds, more orcs might run over it. It’s up to you and your trusty crossbow to fill them with arrows while waiting for your traps to be ready again. Every level you beat unlocks a different trap type or spell (like fireball or lightning) so by the end of the campaign you’ll have a massive arsenal to choose from.\n\nPros:\n+The difficulty ramps up slowly and gives you a chance to learn various strategies for tackling levels. In the meantime, enjoy the humor. “Oh no he di’nt” – Orc, as he’s knocked into lava\n+You can go back and replay levels with your newly unlocked traps and spells. The game tells you the top scores for each level that your Steam friends achieved. I’m not that competitive though, I just wanted to finish each level and see the story.\n\nCons:\n-I mentioned the difficulty ramps up, and by the end some of the levels seem practically impossible to get max score if you’re trying the Nightmare difficulty.\n\nOverall, Orcs Must Die is a little known gem. The metacritic score is high, but nobody really talks about it. Some of the Steam achievements require mass grinding though, which is a little annoying. 9/10\n","March 17","true","16.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Beware of your mouse finger getting tired though because the combat (apart from the traps you have built) relies on your quickly spammed attacks. The game runs very smoothly and while it's repetitive, it decently maintains the fun as core mechanics are a pleasure to play.\n\nHowever the biggest knock on this game and a very big reason I don't give full recommendation buying this game is that it lacks co-op option. This game would be a lot better in co-op - and indeed the sequel Orcs Must Die! 2 is very much the same game as the first one - new levels but co-op added. So Orcs Must Die! 2 is definitely the way to go, however I would slighly recommend getting this game too as while the sequel has made this game a bit obsolote, owners of Orcs Must Die! get the maps from this first game playable in OMD! 2.","January 6, 2014","true","1.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

And if you are already a "tower defense guy", then this title is a must have.\n\nDespite it tower defense style, you can defeat most of the levels using only spells and weapons like a fire crossbow, a magic sword, bottles of acid and many other apparatus, just like a FPS/action game. Or even better, why not both? After you spread your vicious traps throughout the fortress' hallways you can equip one of your weapons of choice and slay any orc that pass through your killing machines.\n\nOrcs Must Die! have a wide variety of traps, weapons and spells that you can use to stop the hordes of orcs from entering the rifts, you'll play it on the role of the last (and funnier/dumber) War Mage alive, and your duty is to defend the order and protect the land of man from being invaded through the rifts.\n\nFun is the only word capable of defining this game.

Orcs may not be real, but their trials and tribulations have taught me more about the fragility and splendor that we call life.\n\nI can’t express how transformative this masterpiece is. Let’s be clear, it’s not just a masterpiece of the tower defense genre, but of humanity itself.  Orcs must die has turned me into a better person.

You’ll run around killing them with a mixture of clever traps and third person shooting but this tower defense game is really the story of the poor Orcs that you decimate. Every Orc’s story is told with a hallucinatory intensity, whether they were tossed off a cliff by a spring, slowed by tar before being perforated by poison arrows, burned to a crisp by ground based fire traps, or stabbed to death by the merciless protagonist. Orcs may not be real, but their trials and tribulations have taught me more about the fragility and splendor that we call life.\n\nI can’t express how transformative this masterpiece is. Let’s be clear, it’s not just a masterpiece of the tower defense genre, but of humanity itself.  Orcs must die has turned me into a better person. As a result of this game I’ve decided to clean up my act. I will no longer leave spike traps on the floor lest my future offspring trigger them. Also, I will try being friendly with strangers rather than freezing and shattering them.\n","May 25, 2015","true","32.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","2","3","3","0"

Oh, and boring, just to mention it again.\n\nAnother fun fact: Orcs Must Die is NOT a tower defense game, even though it could easily be mistaken for one. But I would rather consider it a 'Tactical Defense TPS'. You're not a commander building towers, you're a guy building traps which are meant to aid you in wrecking Orcs. Lots of them. And boy, it's fun.\n\nLet's begin with the art style and sound. Both are fluent, coherent and quite fine. I won't say superb, because the game obviously is neither an AAA title nor top-actual, but it's well above what would be necessary as a minimum.\nA big point of the game is it's humor, that clearly hit my favour. Whether it's Orc's philosophing and quoting famous memes, or the utterly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥-charming protagonist, or his even more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ monologues, the game makes you chuckle. Whilst orc's get gibbed left and right.\nWhich is literally all this game is about: Killing orcs in the most fashionable/efficient/hilarious way possible. You got a wide array of different traps, weapons and champions at your disposal, and often the level'S themselves have special environmental hazards, high bridges ideal to kick orcs off from, lava pits...\nEven as an enemy of TDGs, the game was great to play.\n\nWhich leads us to it'S only downside: 'was'. The game is terribly short. I've beaten the entire campaign + bonus missions at this point, with a perfect completion on about 75% of all levels (many of those on first try). Yes, there is a 'Nightmare' difficulty, but I'm not sure whether I will go for that or rather switch to the sequel ofthis game instead.\n\nBut hey, it's a budget game,so we can't exspect 40h playtime, can we?\nResult: 8/10 Solid and extremely satisfying way to waste time. ^^","December 12, 2013","true","11.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

There is just something so incredibly satisfying to watch hordes of Orcs get blended in a maze of traps. From spikes on the ground or the walls, massive popup furnaces that churn walls of fire, milling barrels, rotating axes and the most epic weapon of them all in my opinion, the swinging mace. Or if you want to have some fun, the spring trap that makes them go airborn. You can either make them fly over the halls from one side to another using spring traps that face each other (it's just funny to do that :D ) or you simply throw them in lava or acid. Don't feel like blending the orcs? No problem, you can shoot them yourself with crossbow or use various other powers on them as well as place archers and knights that will fight for you. And when you think you exploited all the options, there are also powerup cards that give you special abilities like stronger player characteristics, stronger and faster traps or more powerful weapons. You invest some of the funds you have to buy traps into them and make yourself or the traps more efficient. Just awesome blend of FPS, lite RPG and tower defense. It's brilliant and i can't wait to play Orcs Must Die 2. Just have 3 more missions in the first game, but so far i'm totally in love with this game. Oh and unlike in the Dungeon Defenders, you can re-route their paths with barriers, so you can funnel them through one hallway to make your defending job easier, create a choking point where they all clutter together. It gives the game a proper tower defense feel and a lot more options to exploit on for maximum Orc blending power!\n\nThe game engine is also fantastic. From what i can tell they are using their own engine, but it's super fast, looks really good and has really nice character physics (really love the way how player's dress is affected by the movement) as well as physics that affect the orcs. And they achieved all this without the stupid PhysX. Thumbs up for that! And all this packed with quite well placed humor and player character making fun of himself and the orcs. And the way how developers presented the main character as the most stupid person in the world. It's just really funny game as a whole and love it for that.\n\nAnd since there are so many different options to play through the maps with various approaches to horde control you can have countless hours of fun with the game.

When I went back to play it, it felt like a new game again because I was able to become more creative with devising new trap set-ups. Simply put, this is easily a very enjoyable game that we can keep going back to from time to time until the sequel comes out!\n\nDear Wife:Strategy is the key to winning this game. It invites you to be creative and rewards you with being efficient. Unfortunately, murdering thousands of orcs may not be your cup of tea, so to speak. We’ll definitely pass this one.\n\nMy Last Thoughts: KEPT. I allowed it to stay in my hard drive until the sequel came out.\nIMPRESSED.

Many of the levels, it seems, require you to run back and forth between two different entrances.  In co-op this works marvelously (10 of the original maps can be played in the second title in the series), as each player can hold an entrance, calling the other when things get hairy.  The number of weapons and traps is also less than the second game.  Perhaps this is an unfair criticism, but at the very least, perhaps this review will be helpful to others who are tempted to visit the first game after trying the sequel.","May 6","false","1.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

In Orcs Must Die you control a warmage, in third person view. So instead of building traps in an isometric sort of  view, you now run around setting up traps and actively killing enemies with your character. There's never a dull moment and the fact that you gain new traps after finishing a level gives incentive to keep playing. You'll want to come back for more, it's THAT fun.\nOther than that, the game mechanics are pretty much the same as any other tower defense game; you kill enemies, earn cash, upgrade traps, and try to prevent enemies from taking over your rifts.\nOnly downside, in my opinion, is that it's a single-player affair. I'm sure it would've been more fun when played in co-op mode but maybe that's something for the sequel.\nDon't let that stop you from buying it though !\n\n[Rating: 87/100]","October 15, 2011","true","7.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You play as a white guy, the apprentice of another white guy, and spend literally the entire game killing orcs. That's super racist! I mean, it's not like it's sort of racist or anything like that. The name of the game is "Orcs Must Die!" It's not "Orcs Must Die if Convicted of a Capital Crime" or "Orcs Must Die if it is Necessary to Employ Lethal Force in the Course of Self Defense" or "Orcs Must Die if they are Soldiers in a Justly Fought War" or anything like that. Replace "Orcs" with any other race in the title and you'd have a lawsuit on your hands! The only reason this game isn't banned in Germany is because nobody cares about orcs.

It combines 3rd person shooter with tower defense. This allows you to actively participate in the defense. You'll be shooting down enemies while managing your defenses.\n\nThe level design gives you enough choice to try out different tactics. Sometimes there is one obvious tactic. Other times you have to try out different combos. Even though not all traps are as powerful/balanced, you can't always use the same traps.

You play as the rather dense but ♥♥♥♥♥ure Warmage, who must defend the magical Rifts from untold numbers of marauding orcs, using an array of traps, guardians, spells and weapons.   The main game of achieving a 5-skull rating (no orcs escaping, within a par-time) on all maps is a good challenge - which further fuels your abilities at large-scale orc maiming, as skulls can then be spent to upgrade your equipment.   Slaying the hordes is plenty fun enough, however therein also lies a complex combo-system adding much further depth of play, where the more traps and their afflictions hit an orc, the higher the combo-points, thus making every map replayable to experiment and chase that higher score.   Crisp graphics, great voicing, music, humour and still packed with pure, fun gameplay that's as good on a pad as with a mouse.   Quality arcade action that's only surpassed by it's more content heavy sequel, yet still worth playing first.","December 21, 2012","true","49.4"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

Firstly, most of the levels' difficulty results directly from one decision the devs made; instead of allowing choke-points or open spaces or a single path, the people who made this game decided that each level be bifurcated, but provided portals to allow us to traverse the two.  Pick one, devs.  Difficulty or ease.\nAs well, barricades are among the most expensive single buildables.\nIn this vein, it is much more economically viable to murder all the monsters yourself, as traps are A) very expensive and B) reset much too slowly.  So why, for the love of Atheismo, is there only a 'cash bonus to trap kills' purchaseable!?  Why can't we simply rely on weapons?  Oh, right-- because the devs decided to split each level in two, so we can't simply use one route or the other.  You're forced to use both the (mandatory) crossbow and (shoddy, unreliable) traps.\nStill, it's a fun romp, even for its faults and flaws.","March 14, 2012","false","3.0"," 15 of 52 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","15","52","0","6"

But that was before I got it.\n\nThe concept of being able to attack yourself and use towers is nice and when executed properly works well. Orcs Must Die did not execute it well. Its problem is that if you don't attack you fail and on most every map there are 2 points the orcs come from and there are not 2 of you so you kill 1 side while the other gets through then you go to push back the other side meanwhile the side you were protecting gets up and then your at the very end of the map trying to shoot 2 ways at 1 time and it doesn't work. The only tower to make your enemys stop (at least as far as I played) is not even a tower its a KILLABLE Paladin. So unless you make like 3 of those at each side they all die. Even with 3 they die. Even with lots of support from ranged towers they die. Without using them the enemys move too fast and your towers can't hit them for long enough to kill them and you die.\n\nAnother big problem is that they tryed to make too many towers. You get a tower after each level and they were probably running out of ideas and were just making stupid things. What I really don't like is that 90% of the towers have almost no difference except look or wether its on the wall or the floor or the ceiling. And alot of them just push the orcs so they are only usefull in certain levels where they can push the orcs off the level. Also the ceiling mounted ones alot are useless because the level will have too high ceilings and they won't hit anything.\n\nIt was fun for the first 8ish levels but overall I give it a 5/10. I would recommend you go buy Sanctum 2","March 1, 2014","false","5.6"," 6 of 31 people (19%) found this review helpful","19","6","31","0","2"

A mixture of Tower Defence and 3rd person action, you lay traps to slow down, maim, and kill orcs to prevent them from getting to your base.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zombkraken/recommended/102600/","zombkraken","THE KRAKEN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zombkraken/","453 products in account","This will be the first half of our review for the Orcs Must Die! series. This is the review for the first game, the overall score of which will be averaged with the overall score of Orcs Must Die! 2 to give us our final score for the series as a whole. So far, it’s prospects of a solid score are looking fantastic. Let us begin.\n\nI – Story [7/10]\n\nOrcs Must Die! is a third-person tower defense game from Robot Entertainment, in which, the player assumes the role of the Hero; an otherwise unnamed character and the last living member of the Order. The Order is an ancient and powerful guild of War Mages who have taken it upon themselves to guard Rifts (magical portals that connect the human world and the “Dead World” which also provide a source of magic throughout both worlds.)\n\nThe Dead World is home to a faction known as “The Mob” and is comprised of various creatures such as gnolls, ogres, and (of course) orcs. The Mob is lead by a former student of the Order known as the Sorceress. During the course of the game, the Hero is fighting to keep the Mob at bay despite their every increasing aggression and frequency of attacks.\n\nSpoiler Alert: In the end, the Hero steps through a Rift and closes it forever by means of a spell. Although he saves the human world from destruction at the hands of the Sorceress and her limitless legions, he also destroys the source of magic for both worlds. The human world, now dependent upon magic, begins to steadily deteriorate. The Sorceress, stripped of her powers, is trapped in the Dead World with a gratuitous amount of angry monsters.\n\nThe of OMD! should be thematically familiar to the vast majority of gamers, moviegoers, and readers alike. It is tried and true and it worked wonderfully for the game. That being said, it has still be done before.\n\nII – UI [9/10]\n\nThe user interface was great. It was simple, the minimap worked like a charm, and I kept pressing the “ready” button long before I was actually ready. (Please note that that was not the game’s fault, it was all mine. It felt necessary to talk about it though.) In-game HUD was very user friendly and all of my stats/currently equipped traps (towers) and equipment were easy to refer to. However, the menus seemed to feel a bit clunky. Maybe it was just me, but I felt that they could have used a little tweaking.\n\nIII – Gameplay [10/10]\n\nAs I mentioned in a previous article, I wasn’t always a fan of tower defense games. In most cases, I’m still not crazy about them. But, every now and then, one comes along that attaches itself to my heart like a parasite and sticks with me for the long haul. Orcs Must Die! is one of those special little parasites.\n\nThe vast majority of the maps are incredible free form as far as defensive strategies go. The game starts you off with fairly easy maps and they continually increase in complexity as you hack and slash your way through the campaign. As someone who is (in general) not very good with strategy, I weirdly loved this. It gave me a good chance to brush up on my defense skills and figure out what needs to be where so I’m not eyeball deep in orcs in a few minutes. Should I build outward or inward? Do I need to worry about aerial a-holes or not? Loved it.\n\nAs far as using your character in combat, the third-person perspective was implemented expertly. A reticle is clearly displayed (and not easily lost) so that I can wade straight into the action if need be or snipe fools out from afar. Primary and secondary weapon functions are easily used and easily mastered. Movement is very fluid and the character’s sprint speed is comfortable fast.\n\nIV – Content [10/10]\n\nOrcs Must Die! has a lot of content, especially for a tower defense game. The core game has 24 maps, 6 weapons, 19 traps and minions (in total), and 11 different enemy types. Not only this, but any upgrades you purchase for weapons, traps, etc. are permanent and stay with you throughout the entire game. This is fantastic, in case you were wondering.\n\nThere are two different DLCs for OMD! (Artifacts of Power and Lost Adventures) and both add their fair share of extra content as well. Really though, if you end up purchasing this game, you’ll probably end up picking up the DLC at some pint as well because you’re going to want more.\n\nV – Visual [10/10]\n\nEvery last graphical detail of Orcs Must Die! is enchanting. Character and enemy models are very well done and have a charming, cartoon-esque quality to them. The environments are wonderful and every map has something new for you to ogle in your downtime. When you’re not setting traps or slaying orcs, it’s really worth it to take a few minutes to just explore your surroundings.\n\nVI – Audio [10/10]\n\nSeldom has a game had a more fitting soundtrack than Orcs Must Die! does. Seriously though, just phenomenal. You can annihilate thousands and tens of thousands to this epic score and never grow tired of it. That goes for the annihilation too. It has a very metal feel to it on the whole and I’m sure that War Mages the world over could happily crush skulls to it all day long.\n\nOn top of the score, the voice acting is absolutely superb. The Hero is hilarious and you’ll find yourself laughing at his one-liners and his celebratory dance moves map after map.\n\nVII – Overall [9.3/10]\n\nOverall, Orcs Must Die! is a great game and a true testament of what a tower defense game should be, in my opinion.","January 31, 2015","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The orcs come in a series of waves, and those waves get longer and more difficult until the end of each level. As you complete levels, you gain additional types of traps, and the more you succeed, you gain points to spend to upgrade those traps to make them more powerful.\n\nOverall, this is a very simplistic game... first person shooter meets tower strategy. But, it's kind of addicting, as the traps lend a bit of humor in to the fray, often being used to knock orcs around the maze and off ledges - and a variety of other things that aren't worth spoiling for anyone.\n\nWait for a good Steam Sales (such as the weekend one presently going on) and add the entire franchise to your collection for less than $10. It's definitely worth that for some nearly-mindless entertainment! And, with a Steam-based leaderboard, you can compete with your friends.","August 3, 2014","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This one does more than convince me of this take on the genre - it keeps me coming back for more, time and again.  It's a simple game on the surface, offering an incredible amount of depth and replayability.  The story, though rather stark, is carried by a hilarious, well-acted lead (think a somewhat less intelligent Ash meets a less annoying and offensive Duke) and I genuinely wanted to know more about the world.

Well-designed levels and trap variations provide endless ways to kill orcs! There is no set blueprint to beating a level and it is easy to try out many different strategies. OMD is suited for casual players who want to breeze through the slaughter but also provides a challenge for those who want one -- 5-skulling all the levels on nightmare took quite a lot of strategy tweaking and redo-ing. My only big complaint is that in nightmare mode you don't have any time to set up before the level starts.

At first I was somewhat alarmed by the fact of non-stop killing with the help of various mechanisms, but when I started to play it I was totally absorbed in the process. It can be classified as Tower Defense game, but among other rivals in this type of computer games it is IMHO one of the best.\n\nThe aim of Orcs Must Die is very simple – not to let hordes of orcs, trolls and the like into our world. You are given a tower with one or several portals to be defended from numerous waves of monsters. Upgrading from level to level you are also provided with new different devices, skills, mechanisms, as well as earning money to money to buy ambushes and modernize them. The two most brilliant features of the game are in my opinion the highest level of action tension (what I feared most while playing is that somebody of my household would call me for something) and the elements of tactics and strategy.\n\nread more http://www.viewforum.net/gaming-dept-171/orcs-must-die-2767/","December 8, 2013","true","36.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Played within that order. Once you have completed the game on nightmare you can aim for the highscore tables, but high scores are achieved by getting combo kills, so require entirely different tactics.\n\nThe traps are interesting, there are a handful that you will never use and others you will use in some levels. The swinging mace is one of the most deadly traps you can use.\n\n2 DLCs - Lost adventures adds 5 maps, 1 is a map already in the game played in reverse (a very unique map and a very entertaining map, playing in reverse does make it harder). They also added a handful of new monsters, like the frost bat. Well worth getting.\n- the second DLC is not as worth while, contains a few new traps and weapons. Accessable from the start of the game as well, which makes the first few levels extremely easy if used.\n\nHowever, both DLCs are worthing picking up when on offer.","December 13, 2011","true","31.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Play as the former wizard's apprentice, the War Mage, as you strive to protect magical rifts to the protagonist's homeworld.

The game is so fun that will have you hecticly thinking on your virtual feet to plan the many ways to dispatch the onslaught. Replay levels several times after you manage to unlock all the traps, weapons and upgrades to see if you can make it to the top of the leaderboards amongst your friends or the rest of the world.

With all of the DLC(new weapons/traps), you are given a wide array of weapons and traps to set up to help you kill invading orcs. Just take a look around your map, learn the path the orcs are going to be taking to get to your Rift(the "main base" you're trying to protect, if you will), pick your arsenal for the map, and let it begin! Each Rift will allow only a certain number of orcs to be let through, but let any more than the maximum run through it and it's game over. Campaign lasts a good 7-11 hours depending on how fast you play and how good you become at the game, and then the rest is just playing the game because it is a fun way to pass the time.

The map layouts are filled with opportunities to take advantage of, such as chokepoints and lava pits, and then you can use your avatar to plug the gaps in your defences. The hard rock background music adds to the intensity, and there's a nice Plants vs Zombies style sense of humour. There are hours of fun here even after finishing the campaign, as you can try to complete the maps on higher difficulties or go for 5 star ratings and high scores.

The dungeon atmosphere really makes it stand out from the growing crowd. Lots of weapon and trap unlocks give the right incentive to want to push further in the campaign missions. It does get quite difficult as a single player game because the monsters often attack from opposite sides of the map and it's hard to be fighting two places at once--they do provide portals to shorten the journey but they always seem to be poorly positioned (would have been nicer if you got to place the portals yourself). There is also a high dependence on your shooter skills because the trap reload times take forever in the heat of battle, although it is possible I haven't figured out the right mix. So far, I've only seen upgrades for traps, not weapons which is a bummer.\n\n\n\nNo coop is the game's major weakness, but it is enjoyable despite.","December 6, 2011","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With the myriad scenarios and cartoonishly gruesome methods of dispatching orcs at your fingertips, it's hard to put down. My only gripe with Orcs Must Die! is that there doesn't appear to be any sort of multiplayer mode or level editor, things that would vastly increase the game's replayability. However, despite being a single player game it's very entertaining.

You play as the magicians apprentice and you must stop the Orcs from reaching the Rift, which is a portal to your universe.\nEach level the Orcs break through the doors (or fly through holes in the ceiling) and make their way to the Rift coming in waves. You lay traps in their path, from spiked floors to swinging blades the Orcs blunder through your traps becoming so much meat and with each death you get more money to place more traps. Of course should you get bored of watching them die you can enter the fray yourself firing either a rapid fire crossbow or engaging in melee. Once you complete the level you get skulls based on how well you did which you use to purchase and upgrade traps.\n\nThis game is pretty good, if a little repetitive and the difficulty really ramps up in the later levels, especially if you haven't got the right traps or upgraded them enough. It's very satisfying to see a horde of Orcs be decimated as they wander through your traps, all the while never firing a single shot yourself.\n\nFor £6.99 it's a great game, well worth the price.\n","April 18, 2014","true","15.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well is it really tower defense? It's a yes and no. Towers in this case are traps and you can place them during waves as well if you have money. However you yourself can also defend (much like Sanctum, in fact these two are simliar in more ways then one). Some of the early levels you can beat without usinga  single trap but later you'd have a very hard if not impossible time (in my opinion) to beat the levels without using traps. Traps vary from simple floor spikes and wall arrows to flame spitting floor traps and tar pits. It's not your traditional tower defense but it fits enough for me to put it in this genre. Upgrades to the traps comes outside of the levels and are permanent. No need to worry about which one to upgrade, you do it once and it's for good. There are a lot of traps and weapons in this game, a great variety for many different strategys and plenty of replay value.","March 19, 2012","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Orcs Must Die essentially said to me, "Okay, so you don't like sitting around watching towers kill things. How about if YOU get to kill things too?" And I was like "Okay OMD, I'm listening." And what fun I had. Orcs Must Die strikes an amazing blend of frantic third-person combat with the strategy of Tower Defense, creating a game that forces you to think and react with equal speed. It is challenging, occasionally frustrating but ultimately very rewarding, not every game leaves me feeling so satisfied when the credits finally roll. It's damn funny too, with its idiotic but endearingly determined protagonist and an Ork horde that's quite disenchanted with the whole marauding business and would rather not die horrible deaths in the service of their whiny sorceress.","February 13, 2012","true","14.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
