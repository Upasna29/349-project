Pocket Rumble focuses on reducing the barrier to entry of the genre using a simple two button combo system, while retaining the mind games and exciting strategy people love fighting games for. It's a game in which even a novice could immediately see the metagame after just a bit of practice and explanation, despite how casual it initially appears. It is incomplete as of now, but it looks like it'll become a pretty stellar game once the full release comes out, hopefully sometime this year.","February 1","true","82.2"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

It distills fighting game mechanics down to a two-button configuration, and makes for a really nice, tight experience that really is easy to pick up but deep enough to invest a lot of time in.  The animations are really nice and the characters are clearly inspired by SNK's pocket designs, and in my book that's a good thing.  The color pallets are intentionally limited, but again, if you played the NGPC fighting games, you know what you're getting into here.  It's all intentional and the developers are achieving exactly what they set out to create.  If you aren't a fan of the NGPC fighting games, I can't say for sure how you'll react to all of this, but for the price I still think it's worth a try.\n\nNote: I miss using the clicky little joystick on the NGPC.\n","February 2","true","0.4"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","4"

This is probably going to be whack."\nI was certianly wrong.\n\nAt the time of this review, there are currently two characters playable in this build.\nBoth have four different special attacks, two to each button.\nThey also each have their own unique mechanic.\nNaomi builds meter pressing A+B, and uses it similar to a Force Break, or an EX attack, while Tenchi has a meter that builds up with each special move you use, and gives him access to a super.\nI'm very interested in seeing what other characters will have to set them apart from the rest of the cast.\n\nSpeaking of the cast, while not all characters are playable, you can actually look at them from the character select.\nAll the designs so far look good! The stage that you can currently play on, the school room, also looks nice.\nThe Training Stage is pretty bland, it's very reminiscent of Street Fighter IV, and V's training stages which I personally am not a fan of.\n\nThe game itself is fast, and fun. All characters have 12 HP, and each attack takes away one HP.\nThere's honestly not too much to say about the gameplay if you've played fighting games before, it's just fun.\nThere's no FADC, Roman Cancels, or anything like that, so you'll have to be careful just throwing something out on wakeup, though with how each character seems like they'll have a different mechanic, maybe a future character might have something like that? Who knows.\n\nThe netplay is wonderful, I've only had two or three bad matches out of the ton I've played so far. It's funny to me seeing a game as small as Pocket Rumble having excellent netplay while other, bigger titles like Mortal Kombat X being basically unplayable online, so kudos to the devs for not making that mistake!\n\nSo, overall, it's worth the $10 price tag it is currently at. I don't normally buy into Early Access games, but I'm always down to support a new fighting game. If you also aren't a fan of Early Access, I 100% recommend throwing it on your wishlist, and keeping up with the game until it fully launches, than picking it up whenever it does, because I think this game may have a good future ahead of it!","February 4","true","10.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

I'm basically using this to actually build some solid fighting game fundamentals. In a more typical fighting game, I usually learn a character's special moves, and then I just only ever do special moves. So I never actually build any knowledge about when to play defensive, practicing combos, using normals for damage and spacing/poking! Because anyone can do the special moves in Pocket Rumble, the difference between a good player and a bad player is really stark! I wanna get gud! :D\n\nAlso, love the aesthetics of the game, both visually and in its sound/music.

I'm an avid fighting game player. Although my favorite genre is rpgs, fighting games have always given me the spriit for a competitive edge. Pocket Rumble definitely satiates this desire but why? First and foremost, Pocket Rumble is a retro style fighting game in the veign of old pocket handheld fighters meant to bridge the skill gap between the casual and competitive player. It does this by using simplistic controls. Only two buttons are used with regular normals, air normals, and special moves. At first, the controls felt a little strange because specials are done by holding down the corner directions and holding the button down as well. However, after figuring out the controls, the special moves were pretty easy to adjust to. Each character has four specials and a meter bar. However, Every character's meter is used in a different way. I'll use the first two playable characters as an example. Tenchi has traditional "shoto" character commands (I.E. Ryu and Ken) he utilizes a fireball and  anti air maneuvers and once his meter is filled he can use a special "super" fireball. Naomi, on the other hand, is strictly rush down. She uses a lot of forward advancing special moves with options to mix up the opponent. Her meter is used to make better versions of her specials and she is able to charge it up in the veign of king of fighters or dbz games. Each character moving forward is meant to specialize in their own form of meter building and special implementation, so much so that the characters become shout outs to many other famous fighting game series. WIth this variety in the style of play ,even though only 2 characters are available as of this review, there is going to be a lot of depth to the systems. Even now Its hard for me to stop playing this game online for any amount of time because I'm enjoying it so much. It feels responsive and brings fighting games back to the basics of spacing, anti- airing, and mind games. It is difficult for new fighters to break into the genre and make an impact so I hope that anyone reading this review can give it a chance. Right now it is low on content but once the final product hits we will really have something special on our hands. I recommend looking under the hood of early access to take a peak though. You'll probably like what you see.","February 6","true","12.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I'll be honest, the first time Pocket Rumble tried getting Kickstarted, I was somewhat skeptical and furious: this game claimed to be an homage to the SNK's classic scaled-down fighting games for the NeoGeo Pocket Color, but to me, it looked less like a tribute and more like full-on plagarism and art theft. Fortunately, Cardboard Robot Games apparently realized their mistake and their second attempt was altered significantly, offering up something that truly looked like it was inspired by those impressive for their time handheld fighters.\n\nThe game's mechanics are fairly simple: good for a beginner, but still fun for someone who's familiar with the genre. While most fighting games just give you a standard health bar, Pocket Rumble chooses to give each player a health meter with 10 segments. Each time a character takes a hit, they lose one segment and if a character loses all 10 segments, they lose the round. Health meters are replenished at the start of each round and interestingly enough, the losing player can choose to switch characters between rounds. You're limited to two attack buttons (light and heavy) and special moves are easy to perform - simply press either down-forward or down-back and an attack button, while super moves are similar, but require both buttons (as well as a full meter).\n\nAs of now, there are only two playable characters: Tenchi and Naomi. Tenchi plays something like a shoto-clone, while Naomi evokes a rushdown playstyle that reminds me of Terry Bogard. Cardboard Robot Games promises a new character each month, so hopefully they'll add some variety to the gameplay. There are also only three modes at the moment: local multiplayer, online multiplayer and training mode. There's also a brief overview of the gameplay mechanics, which will eventually be replaced with a full tutorial mode down the line.\n\nTL;DR: It's still really early, but it shows a great deal of promise. I'll update this review once the game leaves early access.","February 2","true","1.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This game takes that wall and turns into a tiny ramp that you'll climb very quickly.\n\nYou'll be able to take part in that mental back and forth between you and your opponent, of figuring out what your opponent wants to do, how to beat it, how your opponent is going to beat what you want to do, what your opponent can't deal with and picking apart the weaknesses in each other's playstyle rather than wrestling with the game to figure out what you want to do. You'll be able to see and experience why any serious fighting game player can't help but let their passion and excitement leak out when they talk about their favourite games or moments.\n\nFor more technical stuff  I'm based in the UK and had a number of very playable matches against folks in the US, the netcode is very stable. If you like to sink your teeth into the fine details of the game hitbox display and a frame data meter give you all the information you'll want are already in the game with full frame data in movelists coming later.\nTraining mode has all the essentials you need (most importantly a record function!).\n\nMost importantly the game is absolutely adorable, the character designs are amazing and the stages have extra effects that trigger whenever you hit the final round to really get your pulse racing. This is a game clearly made by people who love and understand fighting games and the people who play them.\n\nThe game despite being in early access is already a complete if small experience and I'm certainly convinced that it'll only get better as more characters, stages and game modes are added.","February 2","true","9.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Not much too it in terms of match ups with the starting two characters, but it has all the fundamentals to a fighting game to make it a decent learning curve (hit confirms, mix ups, footsies, etc). It really has the potential to be as big as Dive Kick or Lethal League and I highly recommend it.

I'll be honest, the first time Pocket Rumble tried getting Kickstarted, I was somewhat skeptical and furious: this game claimed to be an homage to the SNK's classic scaled-down fighting games for the NeoGeo Pocket Color, but to me, it looked less like a tribute and more like full-on plagarism and art theft. Fortunately, Cardboard Robot Games apparently realized their mistake and their second attempt was altered significantly, offering up something that truly looked like it was inspired by those impressive for their time handheld fighters.\n\nThe game's mechanics are fairly simple: good for a beginner, but still fun for someone who's familiar with the genre. While most fighting games just give you a standard health bar, Pocket Rumble chooses to give each player a health meter with 10 segments. Each time a character takes a hit, they lose one segment and if a character loses all 10 segments, they lose the round. Health meters are replenished at the start of each round and interestingly enough, the losing player can choose to switch characters between rounds. You're limited to two attack buttons (light and heavy) and special moves are easy to perform - simply press either down-forward or down-back and an attack button, while super moves are similar, but require both buttons (as well as a full meter).\n\nAs of now, there are only two playable characters: Tenchi and Naomi. Tenchi plays something like a shoto-clone, while Naomi evokes a rushdown playstyle that reminds me of Terry Bogard. Cardboard Robot Games promises a new character each month, so hopefully they'll add some variety to the gameplay. There are also only three modes at the moment: local multiplayer, online multiplayer and training mode. There's also a brief overview of the gameplay mechanics, which will eventually be replaced with a full tutorial mode down the line.\n\nTL;DR: It's still really early, but it shows a great deal of promise. I'll update this review once the game leaves early access.","February 2","true","1.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The art, music, and characters aren't very inspired, and get very old quick. The early street fighter games are flashier than this.\n\nBut it isn't just the presentation that is sterile. The gameplay is robbed of a lot of the things that make fighting games interesting. The mixup is drab. Combos all feel the same. There's not much difference in damage with most moves, which means you have less reason to go for bigger commitments and bigger moves when you can deal plenty of damage with a few jabs. [In most fighting games, it takes about 100 jabs to kill an opponent, while in this, every individual hit takes away 1/12th of the opponent's health.] There's not much defense aside from invincible reversals, which are very basic. In general, most matches play in exactly the same way. There's not really any sort of skill ceiling, and there isn't really any sort of strategy.\n\nIn the end, this is a fighting game that doesn't have anything that fighting games are supposed to have. It's not worth the money and not worth the time to play a game like this. Either buy a real fighting game, or go get something actually fun for $10.","March 28","false","1.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

The simplified controls may not be for everyone because the game can feel like it lacks depth and some people are weird like me and really enjoy difficult combos. Patches and many other changes can affect this but as of now I do not reccomend the game. BUT feel free to try and it and return it to get your own opinion. This game is really impossible to judge fully because it is incomplete and because it is hard to explain in an inerview. It does not take long for you to decide if you want to keep the game or not.

I'd hold off on this one until they add more content unless you really want to give it a go.","February 27","true","11.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I showed him Pocket Rumble and used the simple inputs and interface to teach him basic fighting game mechanics and fundementals such as spacing, zoning etc. His play was a lot better afterwards. I think this game strikes the perfect balance of being fun for new and experienced players. It is the perfect tool for getting into fighting games and learning tools that can be applied throughout the genre. Can't wait to see the finished product!","May 6","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
