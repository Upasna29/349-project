If you want to relax and play an easy game that makes you feel like you don't suck at playing games then buy this.\n\nALSO I cannot switch from full-screen to window mode. For a game this casual i would of thought that it can be played in window mode. bah!!!","March 14","true","2.8"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","8","10","2","0"

This game is a quick play that allows you to achieve tasks quickly and move through the levels with ease.  The cute inhabitants of this small world bring brightness, colour and fun to the game and even cheer you on with each achievement.  I recommend this little pearl of a game for a short chill out/mental break  session from the real world, a chance to escape reality and be the hero of California.\n\nFor our epic giveaways and similar reviews head to http://www.steamified.com/\n\nTo join in our fantastic community join our Steam group\n","March 26","true","1.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"
