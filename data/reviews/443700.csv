Some parts infuriating, some parts hilarious. Aesthetically, it's downright beautiful. The epic catchy looping music, the beautifully designed map (literally a map) with all manner of objects scattered around. I step into The Inner Sea thinking I was going to be a Pirate like in Sid Meier's Pirates! An hour later, I became the most prominent walrus trader in the New World (made sooooo much money from their tusks). Bet you didn't see that coming.\n\nThe game is simple, you sail around a randomly generated map, trading, exploring, and blowing up other guys ships. The combat is unforgiving and difficult but it has a lot in common with Windward. You travel from port to port, doing missions against very powerful foes. You upgrade your ships, get new ships and try to survive. Unfortunately, the combat is UNFORGIVING AS HELL and you will die a lot until you figure out which ships to not ♥♥♥♥ with. That's alright though, part of the challenge I suspect. Seriously, in about 5 minutes, I went from having a Caravel, to a lifeboat, to a Viking Longship and then back to a lifeboat. Twas hilarious but mildly annoying. It teaches you that maybe Piracy isn't the answer... and that life is better spent gathering Walrus Tusks as a career.\n\nGameplay Footage:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91Acye9iOAE","March 30","true","5.5"," 56 of 58 people (97%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","97","56","58","21","3"

The small map leaves alot to be desired.  The resource generation is tiny, I've only found out how to gather fish and walrus Ivory.  The ivory is OP as a resource, sells for a ton and you can easily exploit harbors near walrus resources to quickly max out cash.\n\nThe game needs to have a the ability to create your own harbor/island.  The seemingly randomness of blueprints needs to be clarified.  I have collected what seems like all of them, as im just getting dupliates now.  But there is no way to know for sure.  And I can only seem to randomly be able to apply the blueprints, i guess its dependant on which ship you have?  That information would be great to know.\n\nThe random "skeleton" or "Tower" dont seem to do anything.  It would be cool to capture these things and have them do something?\n\nThe questing UI is horrible, and completely not worth your time.  The EXP/Gold per quest is insignificant with the walrus farming, and ship battles.  you can kill 5-7 ships in the time it takes to complete a mission, and atleast as far as my 2 ship fleet is concerned, killing other ships is 5-7x more exp generation.  No known benefit for completing the missions.\n\nThere needs to be a way to understand when other skills unlock.  Im not sure if these areas are just not yet developed, or its a mystery.  Overall tooltips need to be created to give the player an understanding of all the concepts of the game.\n\nFun to kill 1hr.  With more content added will be worth the $10","April 2","true","3.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

I was struck at the menu screen with the beautiful music - through I did find it a bit repetitive after being in game for 20 minutes.\n\nYou start out with one ship, blown into an archipelago. Though the game's blurb mentions that it is in the 17th century, I did not see a lot that reflect that, i.e. clothing style, etc. It did not look modern, just not historical enough to my eyes. Maybe dsquare will improve upon that - perhaps add in your captain that you can dress in different styles - like as your fleet gains more power you can make your captain and crew look more cool - more "piratey". What helps me to feel a "immersed" is to be able to connect with your characters.\n\nGameplay\n\nI played some time in the game and did not get to a bigger ship, just my little guy The Buccaneer, and we were handed some tasks from different governors on different islands. Since the first part of the game is mostly discovering the map, there needs to be a lot more to do - what is available now is fishing (which seems to be infinite  - you can fish as much as you want - a bit cheaty) and getting ivory. My understanding is that there are sea monsters but I did not see any while I played. I would suggest perhaps caves to explore or treasure maps that you can find/steal, for example.\n\nI also noticed islands that were empty. It was unclear whether you could claim the island and build it up and become governor or not. A base-building aspect would be awesome!\n\nThe naval battles were simple - you just steer your ship so that it is broadside to the enemy and it will automatically fire. But, and a big but here, the game automatically goes to slow/normal speed and will not allow you to change it back. This sucked because I ended up with some very, very slow naval chases while some big pirate ship chase my little ship out of it's waters. I could not speed up the game and was forced to just sit there. Hmph.\n\nThe battles could be added onto with a lot of cool ideas, like taking prisoners or gathering other factions to your side to band together or even romancing the other captains!\n\n\nPros\nBeautiful artsylte\nLovely seafaring music\nLots of potential\nResponsive dev team\nCons\nBattles are forced to normal speed\nThere needs to be a lot more music tracks\nFreer camera control is needed, not just one direction, three zoom levels\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe Inner Sea has a LOT of promise. It could be the addictive, sandboxy, naval goodness I want - but for now, the game lacks more to DO, more to engage with in the early game. But, since I believe that dsquare is devoted to the project and actively listening to suggestion, I think your early-access purchase would be worth it - even though you may have to wait a bit for the full game experience you want.\n\n\nThis review was submitted by The Jessa Channel, a YouTube channel that focuses on gaming Let's Plays served up with a soupçon of silly and a whole lot of story. Though dsquare provided a copy for review, all thoughts and opinions are entirely my own.\n\nIf you would like to check out the game in action, here's a gameplay video to enjoy:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNnVERPaiIs","April 8","true","1.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Sorry guys.There was help all the way and feed back listened to by the Dev from those a lot  more computer savy than me.So the support can only be described as outstanding.. Collectively I'm sure this will develop into a brilliant game with the input from the punters and from a dev who listens and cares about this game...                                                                                                                                                                                .. Certainly the game looks nice right now,I like the music, controls are fine,all good.It's tough,you have  to be pretty careful who you pick scraps with and no glitches or crashes.Support and game both are fine,   I certainly do recommend The Inner Sea.....","April 13","true","1.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"
