The environment is not just for the sight seeing, it plays a role in your strategy and the paths taken by the AI is modified by it. You will need to adapt quickly and devise an optimal route in which you want attackers to take.\n\nIn the game, you will be creating a path for the AI to take, but unlike most tower defense games, you can block the path. However, AI will start to attack if there is no other way, and you will lose towers or crystals as the game calls them - which could be part of your strategy.\n\nWhile planning your maze, be advised that it is not always the best plan to put your core to the furthest possible corner.  Your crystals will need power and the source is your core. You might start dropping random crystals around, but those would be ineffective compared to the powered ones. Also note that only the same type of crystals can carry or transmit the power between each other, i.e. if you want to place some powered red crystal towards the gate, you will need to create a path of such crystals starting from your core.\n\nLuckily you can stack crystals on top of each other, so it is not a 2D maze you are trying to construct but a 3D one. If you place a crystal on top of another one, it will drop and replace if the bottommost one is destroyed. This gives you some buffer before attackers can breach if you are busy somewhere else. If you want you can also construct crystals above the ground, but they should be touching to an existing crystal on the same level.\n\nThere are 5-6 different types of crystals, each with different abilities, as most tower defense games you have some attacker crystals, some slowing down crystals, some AOE crytals. The interesting ones I could call a "tank" crystal, which has high health but has no attack, so that it can guard other crystals behind it. There is also a teleporter crystal, which can charge and teleport attackers further away. One other type of crystal is used to gain more resources, if you can find a ray of light in the level, and place those there they can generate resources for you.\n\nWhile working with all these, you will struggle to look around for hidden chests, that might appear from time to time. Those will give you some extra resources which you will definitely need. I remember a point in game trying to find a chest where I had no remaining resources and an orc was trying to destroy my last green crystal before the core.\n\nThis game will not hand you the success in a golden platter, you will need to work hard for a strategy and the weakest point in your defense will fail you, easily. And I'm talking about the "normal" difficulty mode, the game also has "hard" and "hell" modes for the hardcore gamers.\n\nI agree that I had to spend some time to get used to the controls, however you won't have any problems once you are familiar with the game. And actually they are not that complicated, you can play the whole game with just mouse if you want.\n\nI believe the game has high replay value, as placing core to a different position can change your game experience altogether, or changing your strategy in terms of maze planning will change everything. Considering the different difficulty settings, if you need to spend more time, you will find a level for your needs.\n\nIn my opinion game has a nice price point, considering the amount of time one can spend on this. I believe Tiestru brings a nice touch to all those tower defense fans.\n","August 21, 2014","true","16.8"," 61 of 80 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","61","80","2","0"

I should have known better from looking at the screenshots and video. Camera controls are horrible. Graphics are unpleasant to look at. My enjoyment of tower defense games, curiosity, and $8 price tag (20% off) are why I purchased it. This one looked like you could even maze in it, which is lacking from most TD games. There are also no sound controls and the music is irritatingly bad. Crystals of lightning look exactly like crystals of fire. Very lazy and half-♥♥♥♥♥ design.","August 20, 2014","false","0.6"," 62 of 108 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","62","108","0","3"

Although I am a sucker for story plots and backgrounds, this game doesn't have the faintest trace of that. For evil to be destroyed, the light must be kept from the darkness. Pretty much your average plot.\n\nI've played the first mission (which is the tutorial) twice, because the game decided not to save my progress. It happens, not complaining about that. And played the second mission too. There are no variety on the towers. You get a wall, fire, ice, a teleport tower which works by "filling up" a teleport bar on that enemy, and when the bar gets full it gets teleported back to its spawn point, a lightning tower that must be "enchanted" to work and a resource generator. And that's it. Of course, there's this new feature which allows you to stack towers one on another, so you can create your own combo, so that can count as an "upgrade" system alright.\n\nThe enchanting system, however, is interesting: As long as you have a line of same-coloured towers connected to your core, they'll get energy from it and get boosted. Since you can build on top of other towers, you can play a bit with three dimensional paths to take your core's energy further.\n\nIssue is: You'll spend 20% of your time trying to stack the tower on the tower you actually wanted, and having it being placed anywhere, but where you wanted it. The camera it's fixed at a weird angle, and you can only adjust it's height.\n\nAnd you get that for 11 missions (not counting the secret levels). After that, you have a hard mode, and then an even harder mode, which I can only guess it's the same, but with tougher and beefed up enemies.\n\n=====\n\nIt's your generic simplistic tower defense, with no standing-out features. On top o' that, there are no achievements, nor Steam TC, so I think this one could be passed.","July 5, 2015","false","0.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drahzek/recommended/317720/","drahzek","DrAhzek DarkBrony","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drahzek/","145 products in account","I don't recommend this game to anyone looking for something refreshing. This game is so simple it hurts. Level designs are nice and shows a great promise, but it's a lost cause because of the game mechanics. Destructable towers make sense, but it's just annoying to see a huge map, with lots of possibilities, and being able to raise only a few towers before the game ends(pretty much the same problem like in Sanctum 2, but in here it's not because of the tower limit). The other issue is the variety of enemies and towers. Enemies are too repetitive and all towers look the same. It gets boring surprisingly quickly.\n\nThis game would be even 6/10 if they'd changed the towers/enemies designs and made the game longer(more enemies and waves) and more strategy-like(large maps, full of opportunities, are begging for huge "towers&walls" mazes like in the rest of tower defense games). For now, it's only 4/10, mostly because of nice graphics.","August 21, 2014","false","0.9"," 26 of 50 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","26","50","0","0"

At first it seemed promising. But, the camera controls quickly ruined it for me the first time I was on a challenging level and needed to quickly pan from one area to another and back again. In a TD game, this is probably one of the most important things in making the game playable, so when it isn't done extremely well and easy to control, the game as a whole is quickly ruined.","January 8","false","3.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The enemies are just blocky orcs that all look the same (the only difference being color of the head) and sometimes we also get simple spiders or scorpions between the waves of orcs.\nWell at least we HAVE those spiders and such among the enemies, the towers at your disposal are completely lacking in imagination, creativity... and usefulness. The towers are just generic crystals, that differ in color, based on their function, and there are only six of them.\n\nThe gameplay is nothing interesting or new, the open, 3D environments where you can build whatever tower formation you want, is probably the only good thing I could say about this game, but while it is nice idea, the game failed to utilize it (and also, camera controls are rather poor and mildly annoying.)\nOpen levels like that could be used to let players build large mazes of towers, and let them test various different strategies, but the game decided to make short levels, where you barely have time and resources to put even a dozen of towers, before you have to start from square one in the next level. And even if you had those and could build actual mazes, it wouldn't work because you can't really direct enemies as you want, since for the most part they'll just destroy towers in their path, and charge straight for the core. So all you can really do is to make simple formation around the core, and wait until all the enemies die, so you could do the same thing in the next level. That is also enforced by the fact that most towers are pretty much useless, and you'll probably use only two out of six available.","June 24, 2015","false","1.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It does lock you from selling though ...\n- Mobs sometimes get stuck, at first I thought it was normal, giving you breather, but alas it looks like its a bug.\n\nSuggestions:\n- Get rid of restart button that resets progress\n- Fix pathing of enemies getting stuck.
