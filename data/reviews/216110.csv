A whole lot of fun, reminiscent of the old Cannon Fodder games. Overall it looked GREAT but the controls, since this was ported over from a touch interface, were a bit lacking. After the publisher read so many comments about this short-coming they added the ability to use keyboard / mouse for controlling your characters. I would have preferred Twin-Stick controls but I'll take what I can get here. :)\n\nAfter the update I have been loving this game greatly. Game loads quick, gameplay itself is quick to pick up, and the graphics are, cartoony but, fantastic.\n\nIf you enjoy leading some characters around shooting and blasting things you'll have a great time with this title. Also, since everyone must join the bandwagon (and I, for one, love them for it), this game also includes a zombie survival mode. Maps are a bit small for my tastes and it gets a bit hectic sometimes leading your "snake" of men through the environment and zombies, but overall a ton of fun.\n\nIn summation, buy this game (on sale or full price) today and support a developer providing great games, and, who listens to their player-base.","April 2, 2015","true","3.8"," 56 of 65 people (86%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","86","56","65","10","0"

Chose this game (thanks Josh) installed it, and felt like it was going to be another one of those budget pieces of crap.\n\nI could not have been further off base with that assumption.\n\nYou begin each mission with a brief overview of your objectives. You get to see your squad, and how many people you will be bringing along for the mission. You can buy single mission upgrades, as well as training that lasts from mission to mission. Once you have selected your squad loadout, and upgrades, you begin.\n\nCute, colorful graphics work well, along with some nice explosion effects. Purposely cartoony sound effects and voice acting fit the theme.  Varied mission objectives keep it interesting. Default controls are completely mouse driven, and are terrible. Switch over to WSAD movement and mouse controlled firing, and it controls perfectly.\n\n$5 for this hidden gem. Wait for it to be on sale if you must, but Id pick it up at full price.

It's not a bad game by any stretch, more mediocre than anything else - and it may appeal to big fans of the genre. I just wasn't particularly taken by it.\n\nAlthough it's an iOS port, Tiny Troopers is far from poor and the dev deserves props for patching in some additional control options to overcome teething problems left over from the initial touch interface. A small thing, but always good to see. The game plays exactly as you think a casual topdown shooter would - you track through relatively simple missions with your squad, following along in a string ala Cannon Fodder. Unfortunately, the similarities pretty much end there.\n\nThere are quite a few missions in the game and trying to get three stars on all of them would be a reasonable challenge by the standards of an iOS game, even if they do get samey fairly swiftly. The zombie defense mode is also surprisingly fun for a little while. The graphics are cute and the humour is there, at the very least - the game seems reminiscent of the 3D Worms games in both senses.\n\nUltimately though, what's fun for an hour or two quickly gets stale - and that's why I can't recommend this game. Worth picking up on sale if you like the genre, but otherwise this one seems destined to clutter bundles. Tiny Troopers, I salute you for your efforts but I can't banish Cannon Fodder from my mind. Perhaps that's on me and I shouldn't be making so many comparisons, but that's just how I feel. It suffers the same fate as the numerous Lemmings clones have over the years - even today, they suffer by comparison to the original.","July 5, 2015","false","5.9"," 31 of 35 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","31","35","0","0"

So, if you were thrown off from buying this game because of older reviews that were posted before the changes were made (such as TotalBuiscuit's review), please consider trying the current version on sale, it is freshly polished and has been vastly improved.\n\nTiny Troopers is a lot of fun, the Command Point system along with the Ranking and Leveling add a nice touch to make the game feel a bit more progressive. Individual trooper levelling makes a return and works essentially the same way as it does in the original Cannon Fodder games, each mission a particular trooper survives and completes will provide them with a new rank making them tougher, stronger and improve his weapon capabilities.\nThere are a total of 30 missions in the campaign, 10 missions per chapter. Once these are complete, there is a Campaign+ option to try and challenge yourself further giving this game some replay value, the Zombie mode is a nice touch too to give yourself something more to do.\n\nThere isn't much else to say here. The game is really enjoyable, while not exactly groundbreaking, and is a great game to play if you're looking to get into something quick and fun for a low price. It takes no time at all to get yourself clued up on how to play as the tutorial takes no longer than a minuteto complete because of the simple controls, meaning you can jump right into the action almost instantly. Also just for the record, this game is superior to Cannon Fodder 3.\n\nFor £3.99, I defeinitely recommend this game. When it is on sale, I can't recommend this game enough.","December 9, 2014","true","13.2"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","23","27","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/poddster/recommended/216110/","poddster","Pod","http://steamcommunity.com/id/poddster/","732 products in account","Buy it if it's cheap.\n\nIt's entertaining, but don't expect it to be as good as Cannon Fodder 1/2. It lacks the fluidity and speed present in CF, also you can't split up squads. Such a comparison would usually be unfair, but Tiny Troopers is basically an unashamed attempt to be an "inspired by Cannon Fodder" type of game.\n\nHowever it's better than the real Cannon Fodder 3. I'd also say it's better than Foreign Legion or Bunch of Heroes, so buy it if you were thinking of buying any of those. (If you're looking for something slightly less arcadey, look up 'recruits'. It's been greenlit but is not on the store yet. It's on Desura though. Also lookup running with rifles)\n\n\nThe campaign is weird. There's a persistent set of points/money used, which is gained by completing missions. But if you repeatable fail missions not only do your troops die (and therefore you get poorly skilled replacements) but you don't get any money. You often need to spend money to get some one-time only extra troopers, but if you fail the mission and therefore they die. It's as if the mission has cost you negative money! The game has an angry-birds style ability to choose to replay previous missions (complete with a 3-star rating) so I imagine players can grind old missions for money if they need to cash to buy some uber-force for later ones. I didn't have to do that when doing 'campaign 1'. A quick google and I see it's an iOS game with IAP. Now I'm not surprised by the odd campaign structure. ;)\n\n\nThe mouse controls are tricky to use, but very faithful to CF if you've played it. With the mouse, you click and ALL troops immediately go in that direction. If you want to walk one way whilst shooting the other a great amount of mouse dexterity is required (especially to keep a constant speed up). This was one of the major sources of difficulty in the original Cannon Fodder on later bullet-hell style levels and one of the main adrenaline producing factors.\n\nSwitching to WADS removes that sense of urgency but presents its own problems. (They're also non-rebindable, grr). The keyboard controls are strange and differ from the mouse controls in that all the people no longer move at once. They turn it into a semi twin stick shooter crossed with 'snake'. i.e. you only move the front guy and the rest follow, meaning that if you change direction most of your squad will staying in place for a second or so as the lead guy moves past them, which makes them easy bullet sponges for the enemy. It's pretty annoying.\n\nI don't know if that quirk of the WADS control scheme is to make it more 'balanced' (as all troops instantly moving in the same direction would substantially reduce the likely-hood of your trailing guys getting shot yet be easier to control), or if it just wasn't thought about at all.\n\nAlso: The camera is a bit annoying when shooting, especially on the zombie level.\n\n\nOverall it's quite fun. If they were to up the walkspeed of everything, make the projectiles slightly smaller, make the projectiles faster, make better walk animations, and fix the annoying WADS snake issue I'd say they'd have a very entertaining games on their hands.","December 28, 2013","true","0.9"," 23 of 35 people (66%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","66","23","35","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wirdjos5/recommended/216110/","wirdjos5","Wirdjos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wirdjos5/","89 products in account","Tiny Troopers has a tendency to blur the line between cheeky cartoon violence and horrifying child soldiers. There's plenty of playful allusions to pro-war propaganda and action hero stereotypes, but there's also goofy, childish voices choking out their dying breaths. It's hard to say if the game is playing towards a peculiar sense of humor or if it's trying to build some kind of satirical statement. Either way, that part of the experience is as effective as it is forgettable, just enough to stumble the mood but not quite enough to halt the fun. Troop formation and movement is based entirely around following the leader in single file, so the game quickly becomes a bizarre version of Snake involving bullets and explosives. The campaign is very short, but it ends just quickly enough to avoid overstaying its welcome. After thirty levels it does feel like Tiny Troopers is out of new things do with its formula, which is why it was such a pleasant surprise when Zombie mode turned out to be more than a depressing reskin. The survivor-styled mode reduces the game down to its essential parts and actually grants more control over troop composition than the main game. This extra mode was the perfect cherry to cap this short, silly, (if somewhat disturbing) arcade-like experience.","March 8","true","5.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","1"

Missions on maximum difficulty can be completed effortlessly the first time you see them, provided everyone but your main unit means nothing to you. I'm guessing that the "challenge" is that you can only control the head of your squad and all other members move like a snake behind him. Therefore, when you are trying to avoid fire, you have to do so in a way that does not allow the other members of your party to get hit when they arrive at your location two or three seconds later. Basically, it's inevitable that your main unit will be grossly overpowered and everyone else will be new and inexperienced.\n\nReally, I would sum this game up by saying it's just not very good and be done with it. However, it's struck me right from the main menu that this is intended to be something like 3D, isometric Call of Duty for eight year olds. I don't really mean that in a condescending way, and this isn't really a game that I'd give and eight year old to play unless I was trying to explain military strategy of the Iraq war (run in with thousands of troops, shoot up locals, watch your troops die, and accomplish nothing yet make a lot of money). But really, the maturity level conveyed and depth from the game definitely makes me think ages 8 - 10 and lord knows I can think of better options than this for somebody's childhood.","December 23, 2014","false","1.4"," 28 of 52 people (54%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","54","28","52","6","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tablis/recommended/216110/","tablis","Tablis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tablis/","741 products in account","Tiny Troopers is based on the venerable Amiga classic Cannon Fodder to such an extent that it's pretty much a bootleg of it. Which is not a bad thing purely of itself, although it is casualized and streamlined to "get with the times". Now that could be a bad thing depending on how much of a purist you are, and how attached to the original Cannon Fodder might you be. Luckily for me - and the game, too - I am hardly attached to the original (despite having some sentiment for it) and thus I managed to enjoy this experience.\n\nPart of this casualization stems from the fact that the game was initially developed for mobile devices and ported to PC only at a later time. So the finer points of game design such as how difficult the fights are, or - more precisely - how many opponents might be typically visible at one time are steeped in the realities of touch controls, small screens and the mobile game audience (I'll mercifully leave it at that).\n\nBefore we leave the subject of the game's heritage, I'd like to touch up on its visuals. They're 3D, yes, but a very particular kind of 3D that an experienced eye will immediately identify as "mobile 3D". Which generally boils down to being blocky, unimpressive and focused on performance (low poly).  Which, in turn, means that no effort was spent on improving the visuals for the PC port - or not enough effort, anyways. The saving grace of these visuals is a smart, cartoony art direction that makes good use of the limited resources available to it. The result is that the game looks "acceptable" on PC, kinda like you would expect an indie game to look.\n\nThe original Cannon Fodder tried to convey an anti-war undercurrent in its design and humour. It backfired as it was misunderstood by some and caused controversy, but not the kind the authors intended. I hope those rotten peaceniks learned their lesson, but if not, I can at least see that the developers of Tiny Troopers learned that lesson in their stead. No such triteness is detectable here, the game is pure, nonjudgmental entertainment. It evokes the kind of cheerful imagining of war most of us had when we were kids, similar to what I recently experienced when playing Battle Group 2. Indeed, the target audience here appears to be very young.\n\nThere are 30 levels, each available in 3 difficulty settings. This makes the game somewhat short but not tragically so. These are available as part of a campaign with soldier progression and permadeath (sans Boot Hill) or as standalone missions to farm currency. There is also a survival mode dressed up in zombie trappings and some sort of NG+. The difficulty settings are well apart of each other and offer a varied experience. In the achievement department, "Battlefield Triage!" requires a few hours of aggravating grinding but the rest are straightforward.\n\nI had fun with this. I'd recommend it for a few laughs and some nostalgia, preferably when a discount is available. It's a mediocre game, but I've seen much worse.","May 8","true","8.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You control one or more trooper with the help of additional specially skilled troopers (i.e. medic, machine gunner, special ops, etc...) and the help of extra weapons such as grenades, rockets and air strikes.  The graphics are cartoony and really well done as they lend themselves well to the atmosphere of the game.  The sounds are really good with nice background noises, a nice touch.  There are 30 missions, obviously each getting tougher and three different difficulty levels.  Once you beat the game, you get the new "plus" edition which intensifies the game even more.  On the higher difficulties, this game surpasses the casual and becomes an intense action game.  The storyline is forgetable at best, but it's the fun action that makes this game fun to play.\n\nAlso, a zombie mode was added later on for those that enjoy a good survival gamemode.

Overall it looked GREAT but the controls, since this was ported over from a touch interface, were a bit lacking. After the publisher read so many comments about this short-coming they added the ability to use keyboard / mouse for controlling your characters. I would have preferred Twin-Stick controls but I'll take what I can get here. :)\n\nAfter the update I have been loving this game greatly. Game loads quick, gameplay itself is quick to pick up, and the graphics are, cartoony but, fantastic.\n\nIf you enjoy leading some characters around shooting and blasting things you'll have a great time with this title. Also, since everyone must join the bandwagon (and I, for one, love them for it), this game also includes a zombie survival mode. Maps are a bit small for my tastes and it gets a bit hectic sometimes leading your "snake" of men through the environment and zombies, but overall a ton of fun.\n\nIn summation, buy this game (on sale or full price) today and support a developer providing great games, and, who listens to their player-base.","March 24, 2013","true","1.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

During the short 3 chapter campaign, you accumulate points to spend on non-permanent upgrades including a specialist soldier. During the missions, you pickup usable items like grenades, RPGs, and air strikes. Then you collect medals to spend on permanent recruitment upgrades. Your characters gain experience as long as you keep them alive; if they die, you get new fresh troops. The game does lack controller support which would make the gameplay even better, but you can't go wrong for $2.

Given it is a very small area you are fighting in, this is an artificial constraint built in.\n\nCampaign: Money is the lifeblood of the game, so when you run out of money, it's game over. So why the developers decided to slug you $50 every time you kill a chicken is beyond me. ARE YOU TRYING TO TAKE THE FUN OUT OF THE GAME ???\nOh, more artificial contrainsts  - escorting NPC's means not deviating AT ALL, or they die. To add insult to injury, you lose $500.\nThis makes sense in a game with IAP, to encourage players to buy more coin, but as there is none in this version, SO WHY ♥♥♥♥ING HAVE IT ?\n\nIf your team gets killed - too bad. No replaying the mission, revives, nothing. So you make a mistake that wipes out your uber promoted soldier ? Too ♥♥♥♥ing bad. Yes, I know it is the same in the iOS version but does it *have* to be ?\n\nThere are many things they could have done to make TT a much better game on PC, but instead it's just a cheap cash in with most of the fun cut out of it.\n\nStick to the iPhone version - it's more fun, has more uniforms and gear.

My verdict is this: If you're looking for an easy to learn, basic mechanic top down shooter then you will definitely enjoy this game but if you go into it looking for a well thought out deep tactical experience, one might find themselves a little disappointed. The mechanics are very simple, you lead a squad (every member of your squad automatically follows the unit you control so no worries about micro or positioning) and complete objectives based on each level (this is typically "kill all enemy units", or escort "unit A to point B" typ stuff) while along the way there are hidden items that will allow you to purchase temporary upgrades and equiptment for your men at the end of each level. However you also have to ability to call in med kits, grenades, and other equiptment at any point during a mission so as long as you don't get completely surrounded you can almost always keep your men alive.\n\nThe game's squad tries to take on an Xcom style approach where as a soldier completes missions and survives he will get promoted with gives him a series of buffs and enhancements. Similarly however if a soldier dies he is gone for good and is replaced with a lower ranking soldier. This part can be very frustrating since there is no save option during the campaign so if one your men dies he's gone no matter what. To make up for this though the player can replay individual missions of the campaign and receive a seperate squad of soldiers than his main campaign squad.\n\nThe combat is very basic. Youre squad follows you in a line, you Point and click to shoot, no cover, no ammo, no changing positions. Certain items like armor and grenades can be purchased between missions to add some variables into how the combat will play out.\n\nThe graphics are pretty well done even though i'm almost convinced it uses the same engine as Diablo or Torchlight. The sound effects and voice acting are all intentionally cheesy and exagerated which suits the light heartedness of the game very well. All in all the asking price is pretty fair and if you're into top down point and click shooters or MOBA style combat then you will definitely get some enjoyment out of this game.","March 31, 2015","true","1.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game might be fun on a mobile device w/ a touch screen, but using a KB + Mouse, it's just frustrating and boring. The game basically teaches you how to be an inept tactician by encouraging you to exploit dumb AI. Just get behind a corner, fire a shot and wait for the enemy to run into your ambush. Yeah, it's about as entertaining as watching snails race.\n\nPros:\n-It's pretty!\n\nCons:\n-Enemies shoot you from off-screen\n-Perma-death - seriously? (Troops can be shot by enemies that are off-screen, and you have perma-death?)\n-Movement is horrible\n-The targeting is horrible\n-No controller support\n-Controls are frustrating\n-Constrained camera\n-Dumb AI (Just imagine Lemmings w/ guns)\n\nLuckily, I only wasted a dollar on it.","May 17","false","2.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It does what it says it does and can be actually a lot of fun for the first few minutes, the problem is it gets old quickly and feels more like a free flash game than something you'd normally buy on steam. It doesn't hold much replay value and after about an hour you've seen all the game has to offer. I wouldn't say it's terrible by any means it's just insanely repetitive, with that said, there are hundreds of other games on steam that are absolutely amazing that I would reccomend in a heart beat, even at a lower price range. In the end its just personal preference, but IMO, I would reccomend spending your money elsewhere.","January 27, 2014","false","1.0"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

Guide them through 30 deadly missions with varied objectives: destroy enemy armoured formations, save hostages and eliminate enemy generals, to name but just a few.\n\nYour troopers will face enemy infantry, snipers, technicals and even tanks. The casualty rate is going to be high but there’s an endless supply of fresh recruits to step up and fill the ranks. Those lucky troopers who survive from mission to mission will be promoted, and each new stripe they gain makes them tougher.\n\nTo increase your troopers’ chances of survival, use Command Points to give them better equipment, reinforce their team with a specialist like machine gunner, medic or delta force and call in support drops during missions. War might be hell but this is the funniest way to fight in one!","May 26, 2014","true","191.3"," 20 of 48 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","20","48","0","0"

Sound is good and the graphics are OK.

Short but fun.\nThe con is the baseprice and the replay-value.\nIt's not worth €4.99, because it is really basic, just get it when the game is on sale.\nThe zombie-mode felt like a mweh endless boredom.\n\nSadly, there was no story behind the troopers either, but that's what you get for 4.99","May 13","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
