They even made the buttom HUD went transparent whenever you fly too close to the HUD.\n\nThe game does made me said なんでやねん!? (Read: What the!?)\nIt's a short game, there is only 3 levels to beat but that doesn't mean this game is easy to beat.\nEach level consist of horde of minions, mini-boss, and the boss.\nThe difficulty from stage 1 to stage 2 went up higher than I expected, thanks god I have played "Touhou" before.\nAnd the stage 3 is a hassle because the minions move faster and you have to depend on the enemies bullet to destroy the blue shield.\n\nBullet Hell fans might enjoy this!\n","July 22, 2015","true","0.4"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","19","24","3","0"

Don't let the idea that it has "only three stages" dissuade you from purchasing it. You'll get more entertainment from Nandeyanen's three stages than you would from games that are twice its length (and far more than twice its price).\n\nWhen it comes to gameplay, Nandeyanen!? nails it. Controls are tight and responsive, and everything necessary for dispatching foes is provided right from the start: standard bullet stream, companions to summon, a charge beam, and the ability to "counter" enemy shots. Among these skills, the "bullet counter" is especially notable for its orginality. Functioning much like a "parry" would in a fighting game--specifically Street Fighter III, for those old enough to remember--a successful counter deflects incoming fire. Managing to deflect a torrent of bullets feels pretty satisfying, and using the other skills efficiently is fun, but you'll have to play on "normal" or "hard" to appreciate the cleverness of Nandeyanen's mechanics. The easy difficulty setting oversimplifies countering bullets, making the game *too* easy.\n\nAs for the game's visuals and music, Nandeyanen!? doesn't miss a beat. The game creatively draws upon Japanese mythology to produce a dream-like, immersive world. The stage backgrounds have a lovely hand-painted look to them, and the sprites populating the stages are vibrant, featuring a degree of animation uncommon in bullet hell shoot 'em ups. The game's soundtrack perfectly compliments its visuals, smoothly blending traditional Japanese instruments and vocals with contemporary beats. I haven't experienced such an effective adaptation of Japanese folklore and music in a game since Okami. As with that classic, some familiarity with Japanese culture may enhance appreciation of the game, but thorough knowledge of all things Japanese is not required for enjoyment. Anyone who enjoys beautiful art and music will more than likely be pleased by the game's unique aesthetic and mystic atmosphere.\n\nTchagata Games really has made something special. Yes, it is a short game. But that's typical of the shoot 'em up genre. What's not typical is that Nandeyanen!? offers not only sound gameplay but  also a well-imagined world that has all the appeal of a folktale. This is clearly a labor love by a small indie team invested in crafting a game worth playing and a tale worth telling.\n\nBuy it.","July 23, 2015","true","3.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

The music is ok and the game isn't too diffcult. The gameplay mechanics and  the overall pace feel strange (in a bad way). What I really don't like is the art style and the animations. The backgrounds are ok but everything else looks just ugly and amateurish. I wouldn't recommend it. Not even for the low price. There are many much better shoot'em ups to play.","December 19, 2015","false","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

It's kind of typical fair when it comes to bullet hell games and doesn't do any particular thing wrong or right. It's short and if you're a fan of the genre you might like it. The backgrounds are nice looking. The art design isn't my cup of tea, it definitely has that indie feeling to it.
