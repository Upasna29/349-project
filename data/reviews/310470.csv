Even on the main screen clicking on additional content takes you to a window with included button that helpfuly states 'go to shop', even though there is no DLC to buy just yet.  Even so I decided to give the game a try and I am unhappy to report that my impressions from the many let's play videos were correct.  GAM is quite simply the bare bones of what could eventually become an excellent game.  It is at the moment an extremely shallow offering with little to no depth, in which you engage in the mind numbing process of tweak the trade route with an economy system that already needs a patch.\n\nBut what about the other side of the game, surely it can't just be trade?  Well people, I am sorry to say that the combat system is even more shallow than the trade system, and those of you expecting a Total War type mini-game will be sorely disappointed.  Quite simply you send your units against the enemy units and may the largest army win, there is no battlefield strategy at all.\n\nIt is to the credit of the developers that they have made a game so lacking in depth somewhat enjoyable if you approach it in the right way, which is why I think it will only get better with time and lots of money spent on DLC's.  Unfortunately I am not prepared to spend what could amount to hundreds of pounds on a single game, and if you take my advice hold off on buying it for a couple of years.  By that time there will maybe be a GOTY edition out with all the DLC's included.  Not recommended as it stands.\n\nEdited after 14 hours play to point out a few problems:\n\nTrader Ai is as dumb as your average rock.  Balanced or production settings, doesn't matter.  Trader will still cart stuff around that are not needed while leaving needed goods stockpiled and gathering dust.  Major rework of Trader Ai needed.\n\nProduction costs too high, quite often outstripping the value of the goods produced.  This means that  all production needs to be micromanaged or you end up with a crippled economy and spiraling debt.\n\nTroop upkeep way too high which means that a human player can never match the Ai in numbers.  Again, adds to spiraling debt.\n\nBands of animal that gather in huge numbers and appear to be more intelligent than most humans, seemingly calling out to each other from miles away to come and join the fight.  I cannot stress enough just how much of a nerf these animals need.  Same for the bandits.\n\nResources:  Two problems here.  First there are only 20 of them which is a very low number for any kind of trading and economy sim.  Secondly, they are the same all over the map instead of being region specific so there is no real reason to explore far and wide in search of those rare resources.\n\nCombat system is just bad.  Rock, Paper, Scissors affair that can drag on for hours if there are enough troops on either side and boils down to blob vs blob.\n\nGame as a whole lacks meaningful content.  This is supposed to be a sim of medieval life at a city state level yet all you do is trade and take over a few neutral states.  Don't even try to take over Ai controled major factions because they will have more troops than you, more cities than you and the ability to produce new units out of thin air while your bank balance crumbles, at which point the entirety of your army will give up and go home, even mid fight.  These developers need to look at a few games from the past such as the guild series etc. and take a few hints.\n\nTutorial campaign needs an overhaul so that it actually teaches you how to play and doesn't screw itself over by, for instance, telling you to send mercs against shield using bandits.  For those that don't know mercs use polearms which are apparently pretty useless against shields.  Maybe someone should send a message to the past to let Alexander know that his pike phalanx is actually crap, who knew?  A simple change here such as putting those bandits on horses would alleviate that problem.\n\nMap being huge is made pointless by scouts on speed and by enemies / animals that can see you coming from 50 miles away and rush to engage you in battle.  It is also made pointless by archers that apparently have space-age bows that can fire and hit from miles away.\n\nGame needs a x10 speed option instead of having to hold down the spacebar all the time.\n\nChronicle is not very useful as it stands.  Events should come up as a clickable icon at the top of the screen when they happen.  If the icon is not clicked on then it should vanish after a certain time to avoid screen clutter.\n\nAi cheating needs to be severely toned down and should only be there at all on higher levels.  Normal level should be a level playing field.\n\nI could go on but that lot gives you some indication of the state of the game.  Peace all.","September 25, 2015","false","14.2"," 1,089 of 1,220 people (89%) found this review helpful 43 people found this review funny","89","089","1","43","35"

Don't let my small ammount of game time fool you, I assure you I know what I'm talking about. There is a TLDR at the bottom.\n\nWhen you come to this page and see that it has 44% positive reviews, thats for a reason. The game is basically an economy simulator, and it dosent even matter that its in the medeval ara, it could just as easily be in modern times, becasue theres nothing special about it, other than the buisinesses being of the type from that era. The ENTIRE, let me say it again, ENTIRE game is about managing an economy, and trading. Usually this wouldnt be bad, but heres why it is\n\nCONS-\n\nThe economy system works great, when you build a city, you choose five of the ~20 recources to produce, problem is,  you can get these is any city in any country in the world. There is no reason to create a city outside where you are, or to even trade with another player, becasue you can get it all right there. In fact, you can just build ~5 cities and be set for the rest of the game producing everything you need.\n\n\n"but if I get more people, wont I need more cities to produce more things to keep them happy?" nope, you can litterly just stay where you are, theres no reason to expand. Ever.\n\nOnce you've completed your ~5 cities and are trading with yourself, or others if you want, but you really dont need to, the way players grow in power and gain more money is by building more buildings, but heres the kicker: after the first about 30 minutes of the game (and these games take longer than most Civ. games) the rest of the game is incredibly repetative,you just switch from city to city, constantly buying more buisinesses of the exact same type, more and more, over and over again. and this is all if you haven;t gone bankrupt by this point, which most people are struggling with too hard to even care about the other players. This game might as well be just singleplayer, becasue it dosen't matter if your opponent is there, your both probally drowning in debt. Not to mention the problem with armies: not only are they so simplistic that a second grader could do it with both hands tied behind his back and a blindfold on, theres no reason to buy anything other than low tier units. The only thing that makes a country special is its "unique" units it can get, but  you don't even need them, you can just spam pikemen (lowest teir unit) to get your ♥♥♥♥ done just as well, they are cheaper to maintain, and cheaper to buy, and you can get better attack/defense ability from spamming say ~5 of them than you canfrom a special unit that would cost you more. Not to mention that the debt is so bad that you fall into debt in the damn tutorial, and guess what, if you don't get all the way to the end, you gotta ♥♥♥♥in' start all over again. Have fun with that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.\n\n\nPROS-\n\nThe graphics are alright I guess\n\n\nTLDR: You pretty much do the same thing for the eintire 3-4 hour game every game economy wise, armies are a joke, a 2nd grader could understand and the teir system is useless and broken, might as well be a singleplayer game becasue all players A) have no reason to expand or attack and B) you will all be too busy drowning in debt to do anything about eachother, its a game of see who can float in a sea of debt long enough to not have their "empire" fall apart. Put simply there are better, cheaper games out there. But I mean hey, the graphics are pretty good.\n\n\nOh and I almost forgot, theres only 2 way battles, so if an army of three meet up, one will end up reinforcing the other, even player armies. And not all the units fight, so if you have an army of 4 units vs 4 units, only 2 of them fight each other, the other 2 stand around with their ♥♥♥♥♥ in their hands wondering what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on for litterly years (the battles take something like 5-10 in game years to complete...that makes sense...). So when you go to kill the bandits that have been robbing your trade routs, the bears that have been plaguing the forests will come and reinforce the bandits, while the army of wolves stands idly by waiting for you guys to finish so it can follow you back to town and rob your trade caravans.\n\nIn fact, if you don't read anything else, just consider this:\nAmmount of people who have finished a multiplayer game: 1.1%\nAmmount of people who have captured another players town: 0.7%\nAmmount of people who have won a multiplayer game: 0.7%\nThose last two, are the same.","November 8, 2015","false","14.4"," 496 of 611 people (81%) found this review helpful 91 people found this review funny","81","496","611","91","20"

This is both a semi review and message to the Devs. First off on a good note.\n\nThe AI is good, its hard, its smarter than most I've seen and you should be proud of it. Now nice time is over.\n\nHere are a few points to improve the game vastly:\n\n1) Have MORE than 20 resources for the world. When you start the game you have 5 resources already being collected, so developers you already are able to have 25% of the ENTIRE WORLDS RESOURCES straight off the bat? With your second town, proper placement and adding points into tech to gain refined goods such as bread, beer or pork you will easily have 10 resources. Whats this? You have 50% of the ENTIRE WORLDS RESOURCES AND AVAILABLE PRODUCTION WITHIN 5 MINUTES OF THE GAME???! So the economy will quickly get swamped by the SAME GOODS EVERYONE ELSE HAS, especially when you double or triple production with more points in tech. What is this, the industrial revolution in 1050?! So consumption is so damn low, production is high, population doesn't want to pay taxes or buy things, economy crashes worse than Greece could try. Adding double resources will alleviate the economy issues, diversify and creating interesting games. Ok how about add cows? Get milk, make butter or cheese? Those 3 items don't exsist in the game, devs this is Europe. How about making weapons?? How about making ships?? How about being creative and stop taking the model of EA.\n\n2) Make combat at least mildly interesting as a Zerg Rush. With a possible basic outmanuvering like Hegemony, Medieval TW or any other real time strategy game.\n\n3) Should've made an effort with voice acting with characters instead of the same 10 lines if that many. Seriously get draining, nothing as inspiring as the original stronghold series.\n\n4) Lack of immersion as towns don't look that alive or feel alive, the world seems small. Adding more sounds like chickens, cows, pigs or priests would lighten up the game.\n\n5) No religion aspects? No modifiers to troops, towns or unique personalities? No Patriach or Pope? Oh I know, the Pope obviously wasn't important in that timeframe no worries.\n\nRandom things that could be added. Why not have hunting, why not have several crops barley, leeks, several drinks, whiskey, spirits why not hunt several animals, deer boar, why not attrition, why not better weather mechanics, why not more comfort items, why not a decent economic game, why not a decent military game. Why not a fulfilling game?\n\nNow to quote -ITS THE ECONOMY FOOLS - Paradox Interactive Eu4 random event. Seriously if this was meant to be an economy game, which you devs HAVE DONE BEFORE, then make it vaguely similar or even God-Allah forbid fun. The premise was smart with good intentions but being lazy, narrowminded with actively saying DLC DLC DLC is a great way to end your career in EA.\n\n"But Cat!" Said the devs who worked 5 hours this week.\n"Coding is hard in an airconditioned room with long breaks, long meetings, long periods of fixing last weeks problems"\nYou'd probably be given a good review if you did your job and provided a fun game. Said a cat with a malicious look and blood in his eyes.\n\nHow I now view you guys:\nYour day at work is now consisting of just jerking off at the thought of how great.  How you created this game awesome  with your co-workers. Then you guys join in a circle jerk about how great you are. Then for the daily ritual the Devs this unholy pentagram circle jerk of satan produced this game of sin. You guys can't even compete with the Medieval Total War of 2002! The Pope should call a Crusade on your sins, all of Islam should call a Jihad on your decadance.\n\nNow if you're butthurt I'm glad you read this, but now get off your damn ♥♥♥ and provide a decent game. Seriously why should I buy another game from you in the future and god forbid a DLC? Should I now treat you like CA with lacklustre TW games? Are you going to be like Sid Meier and ride off his name and produce overrated games with little to no content but push out DLC and two years after release its ok? Now I won't get my friends to buy this, I will actively say "Don't buy this game" to anyone who asks.\n\nBut if you guys provide DLC for free which makes the game as intended i.e. to be good, this review will be deleted and I will actively support you. Until then, such is life.","September 26, 2015","false","7.3"," 584 of 805 people (73%) found this review helpful 169 people found this review funny","73","584","805","169","30"

Why go and ruin what was a fine release (comparatively to others games, looking at you Rome 2). It makes no sense but instead people whine and complain about it lacking depth and that the common cry of "the combat is crap" etc. This game has amazing depth, it took me about eight hours to control 65% of the UK and to deal with my economy. This isn't the run of the mill RTS game. No, this is something challenging, difficult and has a niche crowd. This game is for those that enjoyed Europa Universalis 4, Crusader Kings 2 and Civilization 5, this is a thinking mans game, not the equivalent to Call of Duty in strategy form. The map is huge, the graphics are splendid, I get to watch my town grow AND before I was able to see this I was complaining about a lack of walls, well I found my walls, they are in every villages keep. I am alright at this, I will help anyone I can with managing their economy and dealing with the issues of a growing empire.

ZERO immersive.\nI bought this game on pre-release, and that's a mistake I'm never doing again. Please, don't trust what you see on the promo-videos or the screenshots, because what you imagine is not what you get.\nI did play this game with an open mind and a positive mentality, however the game itself made every possible effort in order to make me dislike it. Let's see:\n1.- The only guarantee is that you're going bankrupt. No matter how hard you try, if you ever feel like doing anything besides pressing space bar (for x10 time) and see a couple of trade routes moving, you will go bankrupt.\n2.- The trade route system is nice, however as an "economic" or "trade" game it's quite dull. The amount of resources is quite low, and there's no reward in establishing long distance trade routes that could bring "exotic" goods from -let's say- Paris to Constantinople. And that's a basic thing about trade in human history... we want the things that are from very far away, and we're gonna pay hard for them. But no, not here. You will be surprised that the goods in Constantinople are more like the same that the ones in Nuremberg. Even games from almost 20 years ago (like Merchant Prince) had a much more better economic and trade system, not to say the overall immersion.\n3.- So you like those battle screenshots? Forget about that. The units upkeep is unbaerable and unrealistic. Just by having 5 of the basic units (axemen and archers) you will see your funds crashing. And no, you won't see them winning epic battles, because they will be crushed by leopards (that multiply while fighting) or bandits (extremely more advanced and equiped units, that also multiply while on combat). Don't even dream to take over a city or defeat another player in battle, it's not gonna happen.\n4.- The city and population management lacks any in-depth. It's boring.\n5.- Diplomatic options and AI are extremely poor.\n6.- There's no cultures. That means that if you play in Arabia or Scandinavia it's just the same. (and as I mentioned before... you will produce the same).\nI could keep going on and on and on. I hope the developers do improve this game, but if they think I will ever pay a single buck to see the improvements just forget it... I already got ripped off with 35 dollars.","September 29, 2015","false","10.3"," 233 of 312 people (75%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","75","233","312","10","10"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SimuLord/recommended/310470/","SimuLord","SimuLord","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SimuLord/","122 products in account","This game is a niche within a niche, designed to appeal to a very specific type of strategy game fan.  Basically, if you ever played another game from this same developer (Patrician 4, Port Royale 3, or Rise of Venice) and found yourself wishing that you could have a bigger role in building the actual world and not just trading in it, this game is everything you've ever wanted.\n\nThat's what this game ultimately is---a combination of a Civ-style empire builder (in real time) with 4X elements and the same trading simulation you know and love and have probably been playing since the days of Ascaron (from which studio Gaming Minds' people came, kind of like how Obsidian's full of Black Isle refugees and how Firaxis is Sid Meier's old Microprose team reincarnated.)\n\nOnce you know that, you can start taking this game on its own merits, and there's a lot here if you want to deep dive into it.  In theory, you could just produce all 20 of the game's commodities in four cities total and be completely self-sufficient, and that's a perfectly valid goal to set for yourself in freeplay, if an utterly limited way to do things.  Where the game shines is in how those resources interact.  Gone are the days from Patrician 4 where you constantly asked yourself "why are the mills that make clothing nowhere near the places that manufacture their essential raw material?  Why would anyone want to make something that relies on shipping something in from 1500 miles away in a cog?"  It makes game sense (profits proportional to effort required) but it's wildly unrealistic.\n\nNow you can plan your economy based on what the land provides.  Make towns in meadows that serve as your nation's breadbasket, sending food to that mountain outpost that makes your metal goods.  Butter up your AI rival by creating a town that makes a ridiculous amount of money trading them what they need, and use diplomacy to keep from having to go to war.  Or master those economy mechanics to support a military, but note that realism is in place here---large standing armies just weren't part of this game's time period.\n\nIf you geek out on this genre (and check my Steam library---I geek out HARD on this genre), this is the game you've been waiting for, the culmination of everything a trade simulation and empire-type game can be.\n\nBut that comes with a warning---this game has a "mixed" Steam rating for a reason.  It is absolutely, positively not for everyone.  If you weren't blown away by the previous efforts from Gaming Minds, this will not make any new converts.  I recommend this game, but only to people who are ready to embrace what it has to offer.\n\n(I haven't mentioned multiplayer, since I'm exclusively a singleplayer gamer.  Bear that in mind as well.)","November 20, 2015","true","27.2"," 147 of 189 people (78%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","78","147","189","7","4"

All the elements are pretty basic and the variety of goods traded are few and bland. The only thing you are doing in this game is setting up trade routes and simple trade alliances with the occasional boring battle over which you have no control whatsoever.\n\nThis could have been an awesome game of medieval town and business development with intricate production chains and in depth trading, but sadly it is not. If they had kept the Grand Ages city building style or made a more in depth medieval business simulator like the Guild or even Tropico style it would have been a bestseller. Now it's a game that does neither of the elements that made the other games enjoyable very well. If you want a good enjoyable medieval styled game you'd better play Patrician, Knights of Honor, Medieval Total War, Cursader Kings 2 or the Guild.\n\nI can recommend this game only for people who want to play a basic trading game and are bored with all the older games. In my opinion all the other older  medieval ( trading ) games are better in every way. This is much too bland and not worth the full price. This game should be priced more like simple Indie-games in the 10-20 euro/dollar range. I got it cheap, but if you pay the full price you'd better refund this...this is not worth the price. Even most indie games are better and worth more then this game.\n\nHuge disappointment and a loss for those who want to immerse themselves into medieval trading and building. Maybe this game will be better in the future, but I doubt it.","September 25, 2015","false","1.6"," 215 of 289 people (74%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","74","215","289","9","11"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Grimmblut/recommended/310470/","Grimmblut","Grimmblut","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Grimmblut/","162 products in account","Beautifully made empire building game in a non-fantasy setting of medieval Europe. Furthermore, it is not like Total War (in a positive way, I'm a TW-fan myself). It focuses more on the strategic, econimcal and diplomatic aspects than TW. GA: Medieval offers an enjoyable, fully narrated campaign, alternatively an "open world" play mode and multiplayer mode. I have not yet tested the multiplayer, but will update the review once I have.\n\nMy impressions so far from --- (very bad) to +++ (very good):\n\nStability: +++\nNo crashes and no issues with alt-tabbing in and out of game.\nMusic: ++\nNice, soft medieval background music.\nGraphics: ++\nBetter than the map view of current Total War titles so far. Lacks the unit details of TW, though, but zoom-in and zoom-out is far more smooth plus the weather details are better.\nGameplay: +++\nIn the campaign, you start as the ruler of a small city and have to increase your wealth and power by military and diplomatic means. The missions you receive during the campaign will help you with that. GA:Medieval has a very nice balance of micro- and macromanaging, which is something that I imagine is very hard to design. E.g. you can set up trading routes for your traders within seconds and just let them trade between these cities on their own. They do a good job with that. However, you can still take over manual control to send out traders to buy or sell the exact items in the exact quantities you need. You may stumble over "adventure sites" with your scouts which most times will result in small combats and a bit of loot, if you manage to get the upper hand. Diplomacy is no one-way communcation in this game. AI-Characters may contact you with diplomatic offers or even missions, which may raise or lower your diplomatic standing with other parties. You can decide which buildings to build in your cities, but have to keep an eye on what you want to produce with them, how much and what kind of ressources they need and if there are enough workers in your city to run the production building. Overall very nicely done with a lot of choices to be made.\nTactics: -\nSince I mentioned Total War in my review, I thought it neccessary to touch the topic of "tactics" this game offers. There is no separation of strategic map movement and tactical battles. There is one map which handles both. You do not control the movement of units in battle and so forth. You send them into battle and can pull them out, if you feel that you have to. In this aspect, GA:Medival is far, far behind of TW. If you think GA:Medieval is another TW-clone and you play TW because of the tactical battles, then GA:Medieval will be a vast disapointment in this matter. On the plus site, units in GA:Medieval tend to follow a rock/paper/scissors mechanic, e.g. Archers beeing superior against infantry, but weak against cavalry etc. So you have the tactical option of chosing which units to send into battle against which enemy.\nMultiplayer: ?\nNot yet tested.\n\nI'll add more info to my review once I've gather more insight in the game.\n\nEDIT 1:\nThe first good impressions did no lie. It's good and it's getting better, including NOT A SINGLE graphic or game bug, crash or other technical issue after hours of continous gameplay. Remember that this is the first day of the game's release! Furthermore, and I try not to spoiler, I want to let you know that the advancement of your rank isn't just a number that increases over time. Entire new aspects of the game become available and you continously shift from micromanaging to macromanaging - without losing the ability to micromanage units, cities and so on if you feel you should intervene.\n\nEDIT 2:\nThe story of the campaign is easy to follow and surprises with some "interesting" turns of events. Again, I don't mean to spoiler. That said, I just got the steam achievement "Got Laid!". :D\n\nEDIT 3:\nThere's far more trading to be done than I tought. Although you can "fire and forget" your trader units and send them on a trading route of cities you specified where they buy and sell stuff, you will still want to micro at least one trader unit. I'm still early in the game and maybe the weight of the trading aspect will shift once I've advanced my rank from names that sound mercantile (Merchant, Landlord, etc.) to more noble titles. I still review the Gameplay as very good (+++), but the focus on trading that I feel in this early stage of the game push the rating a little in the direction of "only" good (++) without justifying a demotion yet.","September 25, 2015","true","20.2"," 312 of 434 people (72%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","72","312","434","13","15"

The game feels empty, a bit boring and simplistic. Imagine a Civ 5 with the biggest world imaginable and basically 8 opponents and a few citystates and no need for expansion because 4-5 strategically placed production centers can just aswell produce everything unlimited as could 40-50 cities. There just aint no need for a massive empire nor does it help to have one other than have it. Population is strictly based on your production buildings.

They have fixed the very expensive military. Good. It still lacks reason in the production area as far as costs are concerned, and it is time consuming to either conquer or admit towns through trade. Once you have done a couple either way, it is boring and tedious. There are usually about 30 or so towns to bring to your cause, and they are all the same, just slightly different combinations of goods. Leopards and cheetahs (in England?) are very tough ♥♥♥♥♥cats and can kill entire military units, and they also respawn.\n\nYou cant control military units in battle except to run away, and you build through a menu rather than a city sim. Disappointing but I will follow any changes they make and update thie review.\n\n\nI played this on normal settings for 40hrs over several games.

It's well thought out, and in depth.  The problem I see is many players don't understand the concept of supply driven economics.\nMyth #1.  You just need 5 cities.....\nIt's true, you can have 5 cities, and between them you can aquire all the resource types in the game....Seems fairly simple, even droll, However...This game has an in depth Economic aspect!!!  Trade is the primary source of income in the game.  That being said, your cities trade with one another, making profit, BASED ON SUPPLY AND DEMAND!!   If all 5 cities have all the resources they need, and they only trade with one another, as the cities grow, the supply Increases, and the demand Decreases.  This causes the trades to become less, and less profitable, and eventually your trade routs are loosing money rather than making money, and you go bankrupt.\nYou have to carefully choose which resources you have in each city, based on the resources available in the area of the city, AND the needs of the neighboring Cities, be they yours or another player, or the AI.  I'm just 10 Hours into the game, I am a Baron, with 8 Cities, I have a Standing army of 50 units, and I am a Millionare...Litterally.....\nMyth #2.  There's no need to aquire more cities.\nThe game has a research tree that, as you could guess, enhances your economic abilities, and gives advanced units etc. Every time you level up, you get 3 more points to invest in "Development" (the research tree.)  The most effective way to level up, is *Drum Roll*..Aquiring More cities.!  More cities means more research, means a stronger economy, means bigger military, etc.   You can bribe your way into gaining near by cities, or just build one your self.  Again, if you just sit there with 5 cities selling the same goods to them they are going to flatline.  Expansion is essential!\nMyth #3.  There is no replayability.\nPerhaps not in the campaign, since it is a linear plot, but there are numerous strategies one could employ to try to advance, even in the Campaign.  The free play option, is just that.  You can adjust the difficulty and numerous aspects of the game in the Single player version, to say nothing of a Multiplayer version.  ( I have not gone into Multi PLayer yet.)\nSo replayability?...There's plenty.\nNow to be fair, the game does have some things I find amusing, if not anoying...Like n "Army of wolves"...350 wolves fighting as an organizd unit???? Rreally?? It wouldn't be so bad, but the will soundly defeat an army of 500 Militia...\nThen there's the fact that your merchants Only focus on Profit when they are automated, and pay little attention to the city's Needs, like food, and they don't seem to prioritize certain resources over another in a city.  For example, I have a city that needs Coal to manufacture tools, But there is another city in the trade lane that is just low on coal in general (doesn't "Need" the coal).  The Merchant will drop the coal in the first city that is lowest in the product to gain the most profit, rather than send it to the city that requires it to produce a product First.  As a result, you sometimes have to micromanage trade routs.\n\nAll and all it's a great game.  Chalanging, fun, and in depth... You just need to have a basic understanding of Supply driven economics, and the rest is trial and error.\nI absolutly recomend this game!","December 2, 2015","true","22.7"," 110 of 144 people (76%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","76","110","144","5","2"

Then your empire gets more complex.  At that point, you realize that you can't do much to control what the traders do once you set up their paths, and every battle is basically throwing your troops at theirs, and hoping your troops which get a bonus line up against their troops that suffer from that bonus (if there are mixed troops, there is no telling how it will go).  You have no control over them at that point.\n\nEnvironment:  Europe feels... empty.  Others have said it.  They are right.  The game advertises sometihng like 20 million square miles, but your scout covers them in short order.  In spite of that, there just aren't that many cities to interract with.  Eventually your opponents will blob out uncontrollably (France had all of France and half of Spain by 1074).  Your cities never revolt,  and combat is easy to avoid, so you can just spread out in every direction, making an empire so vast that it would have been unmanageable in the medieval era.  In fact, the game encourages you to do this, since the best of each unit type can only be received regionally.\n\nEvents:  There are never good events, only bad ones.  Famines without excellent harvests.  Plagues without baby booms.  Volcanoes without the subsequent soil improvements.\n\nTrade goods:  limited in quantity, and you can easily make cities in nearly every region that can make the top tier goods without trading.\n\nCampaign:  Easy to complete, but only if you don't strictly follow it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hikariws/recommended/310470/","hikariws","Hikari.ws","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hikariws/","56 products in account","GAM is not a bad game, but I can't recommend it.\n\nMany people say it's broken or that it's a recess simulation. The game is just hard to learn.\n\nIt is basically an RTS, but the strategy resides in the trade system. War does exist, but it happens only a few hours after the match starts, and it's very expensive.\n\nWar requires little strategy and no tatics. You just send your army on the enemy and let them fight, while you go back to manage your empire's trade economy. If you want a game aimed on war, just don't buy this, it has less of that than Civilization.\n\nDiplomacy is also limited. There is a rank, as follows: neutral > be allowed to transit inside the empire > trade inside it > peace > ally army. We can only go up or down 1 rank at a time, then there's a cooldown before we can change rank again. Only when we're on neutral we can declare war and attack. If we're above neutral rank, we must go decreasing it over time before being allowed to declare war. We are able to trade resources and gold, pay for ranking up and demand payment to remain on current rank (else decreasing it).\n\nThe trading system is the most complex I've ever seen, and it's what we spend most time working on. Basically, there are 20 resources on the game, they are consumed by citizens, military and production of other resources. In example, every person needs to eat grain, building stuff requires lumber, and we can also use grain to produce beer, which people drink.\n\nFrom those 20 resources, each city can produce 5. The excess of production is bought by traders and sold on cities that don't produce that resource locally. When a resource is in excess, its price decreases, when it's lacking its price goes high. Traders must buy cheap and sell expensive to profit. We can automate traders routes, but the economy is dynamic and we still need to be always watching what's in excess and what's being needed and manage it.\n\nAs I said in begining, this game could be good and has potential, but it lacks in many areas:\n\n1) The game is too hard to learn. Keeping the economy alive is a challenge. After more than 10 runs I learned how to handle it, but it's always a challenge and we must be careful to not let the expenses overcome the incomes.\n\n2) That's why some people call it a recess simulation, because of how hard it is to manage an empire economy. And when our balance goes 0 (which means bankrupcy), traders can't buy resources anymore and the army denies obeying orders. Yes, we paid a big amount to train the army, we pay weekly salary to them even when they are idle, and when we need them, if we don't have money at the moment, they just stay on current city and denies to leave. If they are fighting and money goes to 0 (most of it spent paying them), they leave the fight and go to nearest city and never leave it.\n\nImagine how frustrating it is to be being attacked or be in the middle of a fight, have spent gold and resources building an army, and when you need them they aren't there for you.\n\n3) Resources aren't geographically spread. Manufactured resources, like cloth, beer and bread, can be produced in any city, given that town has the raw material needed to produce them. Raw materials are limited to places on the map where they are available and we can settle a city. The problem is that 20 resources is a low amount, and in an area where we can have 5 cities we'll find all raw material resources.\n\nBecause of that, there's no incentive (resources-wise) to expand the empire. Be it by conquering or trading. Expanding is just more of the same.\n\n4) Multiplayer is boring. It's the old create/join game. Matches take many many hours to happen, nobody stays online for so long. Matches can be saved and played later, but then new players will start on already developed cities, which they might not like.\n\nAlso, the game has a feature to fast forward time. In single player, it works kinda well. But in multiplayer, it only happens when all player activate it together, holding the space key. In practice it never happens, and there is still the lag that hang everybody when any 1 player lags. This makes multiplayer be MUCH slower than single player.\n\n5) War is expensive. Not only because army is extremelly expensive, sieaging a city takes time untill it's stolen. And when it finally happens, the costs of maintaining that city are very high, while the city in the begining produces pratically nothing. We must quickly send an automated trader to merge it into our economy system and wait for it to recover. While that, our income remains negative and our balance decreases risking reach 0.\n\nAnd when we finally bring the city back into working... we earn nothing for all the trouble. It's just a normal city as any other we have, but much more expensive than a settled one since it's already developed. We can't destroy a stolen city, of remove it from our empire. Once taken, it will be there and ours forever.\n\nThere are 2 reason we may have to steal a city: a) at the long run it will be less expensive than settling one, because its business buildings will be already bought (but it's cheaper to settle and build ourselves than spend on the war to steal it) and b) when we have already settled cities on all the available land and our borders are close to our neightboors.\n\nThere are of course strategies to bring an enemy to bankrupcy and pwn him hard, but we're usually busy trying to avoid our own to effectivelly be able to do it with others.\n\nIt's so hard that even in the campain, which is a bsics tutorial, we bankrupt and can't continue.\n\n================\n\nBecause of all that I can't recommend GAM. There are other better and cheaper games out there.","October 14, 2015","false","55.9"," 108 of 144 people (75%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","75","108","144","11","4"

THIS GAME HAS A NARROW APPEAL AND WILL NOT BE RIGHT FOR EVERYONE***\n***Please do your research and consider your expectations carefully before purchasing***\n\nA Slick and Barebones Wedding of Kalypso's Strengths...And Nothing Else\nLet's talk a little about the context that spawned the  "whats" and the "whys" behind Kalypso's Grand Ages franchise.  Hopefully we'll reach some insights about the games and their place in history.\n\nKalypso's flagship Tropico games are arguable among the best examples of the citybuilder genre in the last decade, and they've achieved a market saturation so viscous I'm confident in my assumption that you have most likely put at least a few hours into the franchise.  Kalypso uses a large portion of its sales capital to reinvest in the constant refinement of gameplay systems.  If there's one thing Kalypso knows how to make, it's a high-grade citybuilder.  For the most part in the Tropico games the major mangement systems and input-output relationships are balanced and intuitive- but also immersive and challenging.  Though I grudgingly admit that at some point Tropico 5's gameplay grew too cluttered and frenetic for me to enjoy. I'm old and I have ADD and I just can't keep up.\n\nMeanwhile, however, Kalypso has been quietly producing, reproducing, and more or less defining the standards for many contemporary mechanics and play paradigms within the somewhat niche genre of historical commodity-management games.  If you already know all this, I hail you as a fellow and thank you for keeping the genre alive.  If you aren't sure what I'm talking about, take a look deep in game list or at old bundles gathering dust in the ether, or think back to deep sales you've ignored.  Kalypso developed its systems across three paralell historical franchises: Patrician, Port Royale, and Rise of Venice.  These games aren't for everyone, but what they do- a lite but compelling simulation of "Invisible Hand" market relationships- they do very well. Most fans of the genre (myself included) own and play most if not all of Kalypso's contributions. The systems reward gamers who approach situations with some shrewd forethought,  who conjure a little extra willingness to grind, and who summon the chutzpah to make a few heavy gambles against the caprice of future markets.  Usually this just keeps you in the black but when it all works as you planned, you and your dynasty become fabulousy wealthy, and your organization's trade activities grants your allies prosperity and your competitors destitution. In-game this extraordinary success just means some shifting digits on a little spreadsheet with some fancy historical trims. Maybe that's why this genre in its purer forms is such a niche product.\n\nAs a devotee of both genres I was giddy when word starting circulating about Kalypso's new concept, the "Grand Ages" franchise, which would combine the lessons from their other games into a seamless historical management sandbox.  Unfortunately what emerged, Grand Ages: Rome, was a jumbled Frankengame.  It was interesting but clunky and unintuitive, a sort of high-concept quagmire with a confused sense of scale and a baffling set of competing paradigms. Kalypso had included almost every system they'd ever made and then threw some more in there on top for good measure.\n\nA Roman Pundit Said "There's Nothing New Under the Sun"...By Medieval Times Most of the Old is Gone Too...\nIf GA: Rome is one side of the pundulum's swing, then GA: Medieval is the full swing opposite.  Kalypso has eliminated everything but the commodity management sheets and has stripped city management down to a single interface book from which you can either build one of the limited and static improvements or upgrade your commodity production facilities.  The rest of the UI follows a similar pattern: icons move around a map and at certain times you interact with various spreadsheets to influence or direct markets and growth.\n\nDon't get me wrong: it's deep and complex and finely balanced.  But it's startlingly narrow.  Every player is more or less exactly the same in terms of abilities and playfeel.  The only concessions to cultural distinctiveness are the local names and complexions of traders and governors.  The fact that the map is Europe is completely irrelevant to the gameplay, except that depending on your geography skills you may be able to predict resource placements.\n\nIf GA: Rome was a Frankengame, then GA: Medieval is a skeletal golem: its disparate pieces may function together so well that at first it seems a living thing- but it's not. There's little heart and no breath in this automaton.  But I am convinced Kalypso will continue their refinement and eventually the Grand Ages we dream of will emerge.\n\n6/10-Conditionally recommended for niche fans and for collectors\n\nNo Drama, Just Reviews","September 28, 2015","true","10.8"," 126 of 172 people (73%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","73","126","172","6","12"

I am no expert, by any means. But I pre-ordered and installed the moment I could. I spent most of my Friday playing. I had obligations after about my 7h mark. That being said: I recommend this game for the person who wants to play Empire Economic Sim. After about the 5 hour mark you finally get in to the combat part of the game. It is lite and not very in depth. It is very laissez faire, and if you are looking for some in depth combat, look somewhere else. The game is about establishing an empire and its trade routes. You build an army to protect that and take over other empires.\n\nThe combat is similar to Knights of Honor, if you know the reference. Your men attack in a battle if they are in the general vicinity. You get bonuses based off your armies make-up. Swords beat Pike, Pike beat horse, Horse beats Archer etc. But it is very hands off after moving units in to the area.\n\nBut the game shines when it comes to the economic sim. Building multiple supply chains, figuring out what merchant will make the most of his run, specifically defining his route and what goods he will trade. It is all done very well. And look beautiful. This game is fun for the people it is designed for. If you want a Total War redux, look some where else. Even against the AI it is challenging and figuring out the optimal routes is fun.\n\nI am no expert, and I feel I have only slightly broken in to this game.

The idea has great potential, and I enjoyed the earlier stages of the game, but overall it falls flat. It's fun building your initial settlements, getting all of the resources and optimizing the trade routes. Then, nothing really happens beyond that. The resources are few and you have all of them so what now? Build more cities with the same resources with traders running similar trade routes? There is no payoff from expanding far and wide; you might as well place your cities as close together as possible because the same resources can be found just about anywhere. No cultures either, everyone has the same building tree. At this stage of the game you run into other empires and it becomes a tireless grind. Diplomacy is non existent beyond paying gold for neutrality/trade/alliances. Combat is super simple with only a few unit types and no micromanagement. This is fine by me, I expected this when I bought the game but there are just no pay offs beyond this point, combat or otherwise. The AI will puke out another army every once in a while, you will eventually fight them off while also battling bankruptcy, and maybe take one of their cities. Trying to integrate it into your empire is a chore because you already have everything it produces. I guess you can have traders go there but really who cares. Now it's just stuck on repeat with nothing interesting left to explore. You clone your initial group of several cities over and over, try to organize the chaos of captured cities, and buy more trade carts. The AI has zero personality and reminds me of text-based RPGs. Cities and military units are also lifeless. Fights are not fun to watch. It's sad because the graphics are great, the economics and trade are solid, and I can imagine a great game here but this is just an empty version of that.\n\nAs far as comparisons to other games, this is more like Tropico that anything else (which makes sense since it's also Kalypso). If you've played it, imagine matching farms with factories and seeing palace guards fight.. but not as good.","September 30, 2015","false","36.2"," 68 of 86 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","68","86","2","0"

This game has a lot of potential and while I agree it maybe kinda pricey compare to some of the older games with a very similar genre this game still have its own merit to make it stand out from the rest. Now let me list down some of the things that you should know before purchasing this game;\n\n1. THIS GAME IS NOT TOTAL WAR - thats right, some of the screenshots might a little bit misleading making some players to believe that this game is similar to the franchise that is Total War. I must warned you first that this game is not about total war but more on trade and economic warfare that an all-out battle between soldiers.\n\n2. THIS GAME IS NOT A POLITICAL SIMULATOR - the politics in this game is rather abysmal and frankly for me personally is kinda disappointing as there is really not much for you to do when it comes to politics; other than the occasional declaration of war and trade or any other sort of agreements between neutral and hostile cities/players. It is really simplified to the point where if you are to do any agreement between you and the AIs, all you need to do is pay a sum of money according to the amount of population they have. Disappointing yes, this is one thing I hope will change in the future.\n\n3. THIS GAME IS NOT A CITY BUILDER – too often I see people complain about the fact that there is little to no choice of placement of buildings within the city compared to the likes that is Civilization/ Banished etc so let this be warning to you: This is not a city builder, in fact I would think this is more of an empire builder than anything; you get WILL get the choice to place where you want you city to be, you WILL also get to choose what buildings you want to build in said city, BUT you WILL NOT get the choice of where you want said building to be place at in said city.\n\nTHIS GAME IS A GREAT TRADE-EMPIRE BUILDER SIMULATOR! In fact I would say it shows a somewhat perfect way of what capitalism is all about. Now I’m not here to talk about politics, I’m here to talk about the game itself. One thing great about this game is that really challenges you to make use of what confined land you are given/ spawned in and how to make use of said land’s natural resources.\n\nAs you may already (or not) know, there is 20 resources that you must take advantage of in order to make the money that you need to expand your trade empire. To acquire said resources you must build businesses that will generate the resource that your city is geared for. Another thing you must also take note is that the MERCHANTS in this game that you HIRED are completely in it for their own profit. They will not work like a mindless drone controlled by some human player on what and what not to buy for no profit for them at all. (Though if I am not wrong there is a way for you to do that after researching a technology) They WILL go and buy whatever they think they could make some form of profit from and WILL SELL it to any FIRST CITY they go to that they THINK THEY CAN SELL FOR THE HIGHEST PRICE. Of course where the merchants goes to is completely controllable by the player but how and what they is mostly determined by the merchants. You can control this somewhat by controlling the trade route that you set them in manually or by building the warehouse and designating the resources you want them to stockpile for resale in another city by another merchant. This may seem very complicated at first but after playing it for awhile (or reading the guides that some of the community has made) you will eventually get the hang of it. This game has a nice balance in micromanagement and macromanagement and may be for everyone.\n\nWarfare in this game though pretty much boils down to a numbers game with a simple rock-paper-scissors format where archers beats swordsman, swordsman beats spearman and spearman beats horseman. Maintenance of the troops is also somewhat a problem in the early game where you have no money as the troop’s payment is rather high and note that you must maintain the troops with supplies from your nearest city as well giving them a range penalty on how they can from your empire. Most of the time a spam of mercenaries would be enough for most situations, only at times you will need to have a small contingent of elite troops such as knights and the likes. Another thing you should not is that certain units are regional base and can only be hired at certain regions. There will also be the occasional raids by bandits and the likes where you can build an archer tower to kinda counter it. A problem I have with this would be the large attacks of wild animals like bears and wolves which the developer has will looked into.  There is also a naval warship and the likes but it’s pretty much the same as the land.\n\nSo here’s the indepth review/ preview of what this game is really like. Now some might argue that this game is unpolished and is set up for future overprices expansions but basing it off on Kalypso ‘s, the most expansive it should be would be around 20 dollars and below. Now I’m saying it based on SGD (Singapore Dollars) pricing so I’m not sure what it would be you monetary terms but I’m sure if they do make it so pricey it would be worth it. Take a look at Patrician IV: Rise of a Dynasty. It’s a pretty pricey amount for a DLC but hey it was worth it.\n\n\nNOW FOR ALL THOSE WHO SKIPPED ALL THE WAY DOWN HERE, HERE’S THE SHORT VERSION OF IT:\n\nPros:\nStability – No crashes so far, all in all pretty stable even on the highest settings and when Alt-Tabbing in and out.\n\nMusic – I personally love the music in this game, Nice and soft medievalish music\n\nGraphics – It’s actually better, in my opinion, than the Total War games map view and less laggy compare to their newer games. The troop details are not as extensive as Total War though.\n\nGameplay – Campaign in this game is a good combination of basic tutorials and open campaign gameplay. Though be warned, it will still take a while to get used to as they do not explain every little detail to first time player. Trade is a big factor in this game and even more so than war or anything else for that matter. Do not be deceived by the Screenshots and trailers talking about war in this game as it is nothing more than a rock-paper-scissors numbers game. This game has a nice balance in micromanagement and macromanagement where trade is biggest factor for victory and is definitely not for everyone.\n\nCons:\nBugs – Like any game out there, there will be bugs. Currently there is a bug where you builder will start upgrading the road only to stop halfway even when you have all your necessary resources needed. Another bug is the occasional resource missing bug where it will say that there is a missing resource.\n\nWildlife – Attacks by wildlife is ridiculous at times as there will be times they will spawn 4 to 5 Bears hunting down your merchants as you trade. It really breaks the immersion. One way I counter this is to build a couple of towers around the roads where they attack and manned them with archers.\n\nWarfare – Like I said earlier and I cannot emphasize it enough, it is nothing but a numbers game with a rock paper scissors format. The only other way to do war is to blockade the cities with ships/ sieging them with troops and starve the city out with something like a timer where troops on both side will die as the game progresses.\nI'll add more info to my review once I've gather more insight in the game.\n","October 11, 2015","true","71.6"," 76 of 104 people (73%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","73","76","104","8","0"

A BIG Plus for this. Not too many new games like this - Attila and only partially Crusader Kings 2 and Civilization V.\n\nCool graphic. I wished that CK2 had it like this. Very good solution. You have strategic view but you can zoom in and you see a city into the details (no need for separate window). I would only like more variety, more faces, more colours and flags and most importantly that developers add different cities look for different regions. And I would prefer if the characters and soldiers were less comic drawing and more reality shots. Bonus plus, that humans are scaled to fit everything else on screen, enough with those giant soldiers covering entire city.\n\nIt is a complex game not too easy to learn, yet not too hard.\n\nDislike:\n\nOverly agressive AI opponents, for my taste, for a game like this. Large minus.\n\nNot too many difficulity levels. Three.

Everyone is moaning about going bankrupt and army costs and how its a reccession simulator. Well its not your are just overproducing the same commodities or your town management is not right.\n\nRight for people who are thinking of buying this game the promo videos are misleading to say the least and the game on the videos are not quite the game you get, Internet shopping right?? BUT... this game is fun and if you stick with it you will have fun so lets get starting on this review.\n\nThe campaign is really good and gives you really good advice and help to advance through it so thats a bonus. Start with that because if you do an open game you will have NO idea what to do. The trading system is good by adding more traders and carts to different locations that you in in reach of because of supply but it lacks depth as all commodities can be produced well.....anywhere. Wine in scandinavia? furs in egypt..? that really needs tweaking. Diplomacy needs looked at as everything costs a fortune be it gold....commodities amongst others every lord/emperor/prince i have met are greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.\n\nCombat is really a cluster ♥♥♥♥ and that is probably the worst part of the game from roaming lynx, bears and wolves who all dwell in caves and no matter how many time you deal with them breed like rats and just come back. I do like the bandit camps and that is more realistic and once you destroy the camp its gone. But you cannot destroy the caves and they will respawn. Combat seems broken I had 5k troops VS 240 bandits and during the battle only 1200 could fight.... so 3800 were standing around the batle cheering on their allies its just not right. Wolves and lynxs can be dealth with but the bears JESUS what do they have machine guns??? they just slaughter your troops, info on bottom battle panel\n\n" your polearm does no more than glance off the enemys formation"\n\ni mean come on?? I have do deal with machine gun wielding, phalanx formationed bears IT REALLY NEEDS WORK.\n\nNow the expansion part is fun and gets harder as you go along now you dont always have to take over towns by force it will cost you far more than you need to. You can do it via diplomacy granded you are liked by their population at over 95% by selling them commodities they are running low on and also your sympathy is over 80%. Population liking i get but sympathy i dont.... Also when you start a campaign you have 8 competitors or how ever many you set but wheres the victory conditions or any idea on how to actually complete the campigh you have just started...... does not say it anywhere maybe you just take out your competitors right??? you would think so but they are always 10 cities infront of you and have atleast 5 x your army its like picking a fight with an apache gun ship ffs\n\nI seriously hope this game gets patched or they need to start giving money back to some people who may have been mis sold PPI..... sorry thats another subject. For the reasons of the promo videos and serious lacking of battle gamplay, no victory conditions on campign and general gamplay issues i would really like to recomend this to anyone that i dont like. Buy it if you like and if you like it im happy for you may even have a game sometime but just remember\n\n\nwatch out for the machine gun wielding phalanx formationed bears :)","September 30, 2015","false","26.3"," 58 of 80 people (73%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","73","58","80","13","0"

It suffers from an overblown advertising campaign that left too much to the imagination. Buyers came expecting a trading game on a grand scale and were severely disappointed. While trade is the crux of the game, it is not a traditional trading game. Sales/profits constitute the entire economic system. Efficiency is counterproductive to success.\n\nEX: Salt requires Timber to produce. If you produce Salt and Timber in the same settlement, you lose sales/profits. You have to produce Timber in another settlement and sell to the one producing Salt. That's the foundation for the entire trade/economy. You have to figure out the combinations that allow settlements to export all their goods and import all the additional goods needed for a growing population. There are 20 goods in total. A settlement can only produce 5.\n\nEX:2 Development Points open new technologies. Points are awarded for the total area your settlements occupy; measured by the circular footprints of your settlements. Building settlements close together to minimize travel times for traders and troops will cost you points. Where footprints overlap, the area is only counted once.\n\n"...play by your own rules in free play..."\n\nThe deal breaker for me was no true Freeplay/sandbox. I'm required to have at least 1 AI competitor, which makes decisions in nanoseconds from a programmed strategy. No matter what disadvantage I give the competitor so I can build in peace, it comes tearing past me demanding tribute with the threat of war.\n\nThere are some other minor things that should be corrected but I believe the devs have left it for dead. Talk of DLC and updates is dated months ago. Last update only increased marketshare [added MAC users] There's nothing but lip service in the forums from developers. "I'll pass that suggestion along. Can't promise anything."

The AI runs well, in fact in most cases the opposing AI will run better than you ever will, so it's not like you're not going to have a challenge, that and the AI traders you command do a pretty effective job, like they did in Rise of Venice, but because of Rise of Venice I can't say I was particularly impressed as it's not new, we've been seeing it for the longest time.\nNow sadly the amount of goods you can create or trade is once again limited, like in every other Kalypso published title of late, it's like they can't go beyond the simple variety of goods for whatever reason, so the maximum we have is 20, which means you can effectively create & distribute everything within the first 5-6 city's with good placement, the game sadly misses a lot of core goods that could be there, but I'm not really sure if this is that big an issue seeing as trading is all automated anyway. It's again nothing we haven't seen from past games, it's all still here with no improvements to innovation.\n\nThe combat, like in most Kalypso games has always been there but they've never really been able to hit the nail on the head & in most cases I'm fine with that, I don't expect stellar combat mechanics from their titles, but Grand Age I have to say has the poorest combat mechanics I've seen in quite some time, it's a prolonged zergy mess, it takes way to long for combat to end, upto weeks for small scale battles & years or even forever for larger scale scenarios, when you & your enemy are fully developed there is no stopping the production of units, you can create units quicker than you can destroy them, so you end up with this eye saw of a mess bogged up in an area until someone goes bankrupt.\nNow that I think about it, they could have taken the combat out & my experience would have improved, that's how bad I consider the combat, you might as well just make it so you have to buy out all the competition, which is another issue I have with the title.\n\nThis is where in my opinion the game falls off more than anything else I mentioned, the Towns/Villages & your interaction with the enemy through Politics & Diplomacy, it's all mediocre with no depth, Money gains you everything for the most part, influence/Sympathy & enemy towns, whatever you want to call it, it's all countered or based on how wealthy you are, it's not controlled by your actions or how you act. That also means if you want to destroy you opponent you can buy out their towns gradually if you're wealthy enough, though I have yet to see the enemy do or attempt this, probably because you'd decline as you're not ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\nTowns/City's are all just Troops & Money spitters, they don't do anything besides that, they don't interact with you or with each other in any real sense apart from when you're using automated traders to pump more cash.\n\nI try not to compare games to other games that take completely different approaches to what they're trying to do, but there are definitely games out there that Grand Age could have taken from, Crusader Kings is a perfect example, hell even Mount & Blade could have influenced this title in a positive way, both of which are filled with depth, in the areas this lacks it, diplomacy/interaction/towns.\n\nMeh, I can only hope they introduce DLC that improves it in a positive way, I don't even care if they go down the Crusader Kings 1000 DLC route, as I'm sure economic simulators a somewhat of a niche genre anyway.\n\nThis review is mostly due to people on the forums who are trying to get others on the forum to create positive reviews for another lack luster title.\nI apologies in advance if this review seems unorganised or poorly written, I don't usually write reviews for anything.","September 28, 2015","false","19.1"," 41 of 55 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","41","55","0","0"

All the groundwork is there for this to be a truley spectacular game, but it just falls frustratingly short. Falling back to cliché car analogies - it's like someone took the time to design and make a very beautiful sports car, but did the interior lazily with some bad IKEA furniture at the last minute.\n\nIt's missing that extra finish, those few extra mechanics which make the game far more fun and engaging (this could be anything from a political system, to more building options, etc.).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/commissarbro/recommended/310470/","commissarbro","CommissarBRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/commissarbro/","1034 products in account","To sum up, this is a game very similar to Patrician with Civ 5 diplomatic elements and very simplistic Total War combat mechanics. Even then, I would compare this game to the classic, Knights of Honor (go buy that and thank me later). The game, aesthetically, is downright beautiful. The towns feel alive and are incredibly visually appealing while the soundtrack is peacefully immersive and you're immediately drawn into this economic simulation Gaming Minds has presented for you. It's actually really peaceful and enjoyable just to watch your (eventually) sprawling country to just "live." How's the gameplay though, you ask? It's alright. Relatively simplistic and easy to get drawn in to it's a pretty barebones simulation of economics on a Medieval scale. You build this building to make "this resource" while paying "set amount of money" as salaries and upkeep and sell the excess as profits. It's not exactly innovative or unique but it's most certainly competent and can be relatively stress-free unlike games such as the Guild 2 where market fluctuations from all manner of events can make or break your Dynasty and personal relationships can increase or decrease the longevity of your life span.\n\nThe combat in this game can also be clunky at times. I don't know if it was intended this way or is just glitches but it seems like troops don't always want to engage troops that are already currently engaged which is rather strange. I found myself battling this problem while trying to take over my nearest neighbor who seemed to have been protected by his city's selection box.\n\nAll in all, the game isn't bad, gameplay-wise it's your standard economic simulation, and not much else. Aesthetically, artisitcally, it's downright gorgeous and it makes for a damn beautiful game to just vicariously inspect.\nGameplay Footage and Overview:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thNCs4itz6A&feature=youtu.be","September 25, 2015","true","13.6"," 89 of 140 people (64%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","64","89","140","9","7"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nusensei/recommended/310470/","nusensei","nusensei","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nusensei/","342 products in account","Grand Ages: Medieval is interesting in that, outwardly, it looks like many things that it isn’t. It takes its name from Grand Ages: Rome, in turn descended from the Imperium Civitas series (Glory of the Roman Empire, Imperium Romanum). However, Medieval is not a city-builder. From trailers, the game looks similar to RTS games like Total War, but military conquest is a token inclusion. The idea of trade and economy might bring up memories of Patrician or even Europa Universalis, and the top-down view even resembles Civilization in some ways. Grand Ages, however, is none of that.\n\nAt best, imagine Civilization with every part of the game stripped down, and the only thing left over is the resource management. I do not exaggerate – resource management is the only gameplay mechanic of this game. It is a very specific niche with a very specific appeal, and there’s that satisfaction when you figure out how to do it right. Sadly, that doesn’t take long at all.\n\nDespite many complaints that the economy is too hard to figure out, it is actually far too simple. The core of the gameplay is centred on the production and distribution of 20 resources, including grain, wine, metals, and so on. Certain resources can then be used to manufacture more advanced goods, and in turn luxury items. These are then sold via trade routes to other cities for profit based on supply and demand. An observant player will realise that succeeding in the game isn’t really based on conquest, but understanding how to get resources to where they are in demand.\n\nMastering the economy starts off with establishing trade routes to cover the resources you don’t have, but once you build new cities with specialties or source from other towns, you’ll find that you can easily supply the 20 different resources internally quite easily, and from there it really comes down to distribution. An understanding of shipping routes on a FedEx scale, with hubs and spokes and warehouses, makes more sense than manually buying and selling. The game features a rather generous auto-trade system with the AI-controlled traders picking items based on demand and always selling at profit. As long as you have enough resources being produced, and enough carts to carry said resources, there’s nothing impeding you from turning an easy profit.\n\nMilitary conquest is barely a thing. First you get annoyed at how your troops get obliterated by packs of hundreds of wild animals that stop your trade routes. Then you set up a strong enough economy to click the train button a few hundred times to build a massive army that takes ages to siege down a city. You either blitz through whole empires with weak fortresses, or spend weeks sitting outside a town to see which HP meter goes down first. There’s no control; just which blob is bigger. And if you don’t want to play the military game, you can just buy out cities with the infinite money you generate.\n\nPerhaps what is most difficult to swallow is that the game isn’t challenging or difficult because of the depth and complexity of the game. It’s because the game’s interface is shockingly designed. For an economic empire builder, there is a surprising lack of information on-screen. Most of the vital information is hidden through several menus. Fine-tuning your economy is more a matter of manually checking lists and then, much to the hatred of my wrist, having to click on what to build, whether it’s more carts or more businesses. It’s agonising that these things aren’t automated or at least provided with shortcuts. Most of the time I spent in the game was looking at menus and clicking the plus button a hundred times.\n\nThe game features a campaign mode, with a story-driven conquest based around the Byzantine Empire, as well as a free-play mode where you can play anywhere in Europe. The campaign teaches you some basics, but is very easy to complete once you master the economy – which takes around 6 hours. The fact that there is only one campaign is sorely disappointing considering the whole map is there, which leads me to believe that Kalypso has another dodgy DLC model in mind. This lack of replay value destroys the value of buying the game. If you’re looking for endless new campaigns such as what you might get from SimCity, Europa Universalis or Civilization, you will not get that satisfaction. It’s just too quick and easy to get a strong economy going and very little challenge.\n\nThis ridiculous tedium, lack of complexity and low replay value renders Grand Ages: Medieval a dismal game. If you like drawing lines on a map, clicking the same button a thousand times and watching a number go up, you might like this game. Even then, you’ll tire of this within a few days. This has been the easiest, least challenging game from Kalypso I have seen.\n\nFor a playthrough of the campaign, see my video series:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbSrMih8cl4","October 30, 2015","false","32.0"," 36 of 49 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","36","49","0","0"

The trailer is misleading. Take a moment, let that sink in...\n\nRight then!\n\nThe combat is extremely simple; Total War this is not. _Do not buy it for the combat._ It's also a bit fiddly and could use a little improvement for what is there, but it boils down to Rock, Paper, Scissors with a ratio control. Have a lot of archers vs a lot of melee and no horses? Bonus to damage, and so on. It's a game of balancing the combats, and numbers. Pure, simple, numbers. If you can field and finance more than the other guy, you'll likely win.\n\nOverall, it's more akin to Patrician than many others I've played, though there is a bit of a Hegemony vibe in there, and a bit of those progress quest-like games too. Numbers, numbers, more! MOAR!\n\nThe trading is the main point of the game: setting the towns up and picking production to create profitable routes, and expand your empire. Grand Ages: Medieval, however, takes a little bit different of an approach. Instead of being able to micro everything, you're controlling the macro. There is no placement, there are no trees to worry about. You plonk down a business, and once it generates some workers it's off an running.

This game lets you found towns, produce and trade good, make war and peace. it has a very nice campaign to show you the basics, there are some special buildings like the Inn where you can buy traders, builders, play a game of dice and send workers to other towns, a church lets you feed feed the poor and hold festivals etc.\n\nDon't expect anything like the total war games, the combat is pretty much out of your control. You can recruit mercenries, pikemen, axe men, scout, cavalry, mounted archer, archersand ships.

Combat does appear in the game, but you do not control it, like the Civvie games for example.\nManagement of trade and production can be both manually controlled or automated, allowing you to play the way you want to.\n\nThe cons:\n\nContent. As it stands the game is quite hollow, there is definately room for the game to be fleshed out in almost every aspect. Content has clearly been removed or never added with the intention of being made available via DLC.\nMods. As far as I can see there is no mod support what so ever, but then again the game was only released yesterday, so we will see if the game will become moddable or not.\n\nConclusion:\n\nA good game but it is in need of fleshing out, I personally do not mind paying for DLC, but only when the game adds something new to an already fleshed out game. Take Cities: Skylines for example, the new After Dark DLC for that game is by far the most outstanding and worthwhile DLC I have ever purchased. What I do not like is content being removed for the purpose of DLC just so developers can make more money. GAM is a good game, it certainly has potential, but the path the developers seem to be taking in terms of content/DLC, I am not sure weather or not I will purchase any DLC if and when it comes along.\n\nOne final note: the price.\n\nThis game is NOT worth 30 pounds, I pre ordered at a discount which I am thankful for, if you do not own this, wait a while and see what the developers do with it. As another review said, wait for a steam sale, or wait for a GOTY edition with DLC included.\n\nBottom line, wait to purchase and give it time.","September 26, 2015","true","5.5"," 65 of 104 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","65","104","0","0"

It includes aspects of diplomatic, military and economic control but, frankly, only the economic aspect works and that is strongly reminiscent of Patrician.\nThe military aspect of the game is poor. You research techs and build units, which are very costly to maintain but you have little control over them other than pointing them in a direction and letting them get on with it. Mounted units move faster than non-mounted, and get into the action first. Some simple way of keeping the units together when moving would be nice.\nThe diplomatic aspect of the game is not much better. You can negotiate agreements with mayors of cities or competitors. You need a Peace Agreement before you can ‘see’ into a city in the same way that you see your own. It doesn’t follow. To me, a way of setting up a trade mission would be more intuitive.\nYou can take over cities militarily or by trading. Sieges are boring and quite why you should be able to take over a city because you supply it with goods eludes me.\nThe trading side of the game is all Patrician. There are no real views to help you manage your empire; each city can produce only five products out of a total of twenty and some of the products require research and consume other products, so there is a supply side problem which is the most challenging aspect of the game. Once you get to the point where you have twenty or thirty cities to manage, plus the traders that are necessary to move the goods between cities, all your time is spent micro managing the production chain.\nEvents happen; fires devastate areas and volcanos erupt at amazingly regular intervals. Wild animals are annoying.\nI bought this with high hopes but was disappointed. It’s nowhere near as good as the Civ games and frankly, Patrician works just as well as a trader game.\nNot recommended.","November 10, 2015","false","91.4"," 24 of 33 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","24","33","0","0"

Forget about the negative reviews. The developers have released a ptach that fixes many release day issues. Also, this is a not a total war game - the battles are fought on the strategic map between the units.\n\nSpeaking of which, the Military is way cool. There are several unit types including Spearmen, Archers, Axeman, Swordsman, Cavalry, Mounted Archers and the cannon fodder unit Mercenaries. Also, each Region has a unique unit. Poland has Knights and Kiev has Crossbowmen as examples. All you need to be able to recruit the unique units are two things: Unlock the unit with Development Points and have the appropriate Barracks in that region.\n\nHowever, long before a Military can be raised a player must conquer the Economic System. Grand Ages: Medieval has a way cool economic system. Each town may have up to five production commodities. In order to increase the size of the city the production must be increased. This will cost money and lumber and bricks = lots of all three. As the city expands the population will require more different goods to be happy. Increasing a city past 1,000 population is good for income but the city will want more different goods.\n\nThe citizens of a city will use the commodites stored there and this mean income. The larger the population the more commodities requried by the citizens. More variety of goods are also needed. Really large cities generate good amounts of money.\n\nTrade routes are also important. These can be set up to run automatically or by manual. Trade routes are the best at making money.\n\nSettlers can be recruited to expand the Kingdom. As cities are created and they grow more Territorial Claims will increase. This will eventually gain the player a new rank and along with it Development Points. Development Points are required to unlock more commodities, infrastructure improvements, and military units.\n\nMilitary units are very expensive, both in gold upkeep cost and comodities used. Grain is very important for the military and the cities. The early patch of the game lowered the military gold upkeep costs by about 50%, making it more possible to to have a military = once the Kingdom is large enough to support the troops.\n\nGrand Ages: Medieval is not a short game, however, gthe game speed may be increased as desired. It is a true strategy game at its finest. This is now a really fun game to play.","October 4, 2015","true","163.7"," 41 of 67 people (61%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","61","41","67","4","5"

But it is not good as a game because every single game mechanic is lacking depth and complexity.\nLater in the game, when you have the right technologies unlocked you even don't need to think anymore. You build 4 cities, so that these 4 cities do have any ressource available in the hole game (it doesn't even matter which region you play in). You build 30 ressourcebuildings of each type and you have a production/consume ratio of 1:1. That also discourages you from trading with anyone else. So this becomes more of a goods-transportation simulation in which you don't have much to do (except for automaticly trading with yourself and founding some cities from time to time). I got millions every month and have most of the things unlocked with just 8 cities, without ever expanding into another region.\n\nThe AI: You can get them to pay you XX millions every 10 weeks or so simply by threatening to cancel the transit agreement. You can ignore them completely, if you get attacked you just spam out 5 units and don't need to bother with them for another year, and like i said: You don't need nor want to trade with them.\n\nThe combat is also not good, even for it's simple mechanic. It just takes ages for every battle. I could live without a good combat, but at least it shouldn't be annoying.\n\nThe game is lacking replayability. You can get everything by just staying in your starting region, which destroys the purpose of what should have been one of the game's strength: the large map. It doesn't even matter what starting region you choose, they're all the same, they just have different borders.\n\n\n\n\nThe Trading is one of the most simple trading mechanics i've ever seen in a trading-sim; the battle is probably the most basic i've ever seen in any game; the city building is what i did expect, but also very simple; The diplomacy is also one of the most simple, and i'd say partly broken; The Replayability is not existent.  And that's pretty much everything this game has to offer right now.\n\nIn it's current state i can't recommend this game, especially considering the absurd price.","October 3, 2015","false","11.8"," 18 of 25 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","18","25","0","1"

I have expected this game to have far more depth. What you get is an extremly  hollow shell ready to be filled with DLC. The devs could have put in so much more effort to fill this world and make it a deep and intersting one. The framework is there, but you can cover all there is to do in this game within an hour.  You build up your towns, which by the way is unimaginatively bland, and you set your traders to automatic trade. That's basically the game in a nutshell. Mind you, this is suppose to be a game based on trade and it's a big fail. The trade aspect is nothing compared to Patriacian or Port Royal.\nThere are of course a few more other things you can do, like building an army and counquer your rivals but its not the core of this game and it's as well poorly executed and shallow. Also, you simply buy up every neutral town around you within minutes, because it is far more efective than using an army and the battle system is not enjoyable anyway. I really wanted to like  Grand Ages Medieval, as I have been following the game's development for a long time, but it's just another example of pushing out company greedy products who's whole existence is build on spamming DLC. I don't mind DLC, as long as you at least put effort into the base game and give the consumer a well rounded product, especially for the asking price.

I looked at gameplays and trailers and I started to get hyped for it since it looked pretty nice. Once I got the game I started it with hopes of a new empire/traiding game where economy would be the focus since that is what they said (devs,youtubers etc..)\n\nAfter a couple of hours I managed to create a little empire after several tries whilst learning the game. I discovered a place where you could see other empires and how well it went for them and so I went in there to look and I beheld the empires that had blobbed the entire map while I only had like 4 cities the AI empires each and everyone had atleast 10 cities... I thought to myself "well i better pick up the pace then". After an hour I had 15 cities and my army was big until I saw the size of each and every other AI empire.. 30-40 CITIES EACH??? Wtf? So after this I started over and this time i did my best to build up a stable empire and I grew quickly but even when it went quiet well for me the AIs spammed cities everywhere and they all had perfect economies. I coninued to play the game because I wanted to find a way to win but since every other empire took decisions every milisecond they could easily defeat me in a war that they started.\n\nAfter this I quit the game for a while. I came back to again a while later and I started to look not into myself for problems but into the game instead and the games Economy system is broken. It does not work as economic systems would work in a logical game or reality. Lets say I produce Salt but I need timber in order to produce it. So would it not make sense to create a timber place next to the salt factory to minimize traveling time and costs? Well not to the game since if you do this then you lose more then you gain... WTF? DEVS?? DO YOU EVEN LOGIC??\n\nI was very disappointed in this game but I learned a good thing after I noticed that I could not get a refund. I learned to listen to my gutfeeling and not to buy on impulses. After this game came out my personal economy improved not just because the game was good but because it was ♥♥♥♥.\n\nDO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU WANT AN ECONOMIC GRAND STRATEGY GAME.\n\nBUY THIS GAME IF YOU WANT A MOBILE GAME ON A PC.

I can play games such as the ones I mentioned for hours and still want more. This game doesn't seem to do it for me in that same way. So, for the time being, until the devs can add some things that bring this game to life, I can't recommend it.\n\nKeep in mind: I've only logged 18 hrs into the game at time of review and will come back and edit if I need to add or delete anything if the game is improved. But for now, I'll give a quick run down of good and bad, and include suggestions to fix the "bad", based on my current experience:\n\nGOOD\n- Beautiful graphics\n- Nice, ambient soundtrack\n- Challenging market supply and demand with trade routes you can manage and monitor for profitability\n- Challenging computer AI\n\nBAD\n- An extremely limited amount of goods. It won't take you long to acquire and produce them before you're having to fight against market saturation and trying to keep prices from plummeting, which will send you into bankruptcy. I'd like to see twice the number of goods in-game than what is already there. Also, I think consumption of goods needs tweaked. You're more often than not producing more than your cities are consuming.\n\n- Diplomacy, I've noticed, boils down to how much you're willing to bribe your neighbors to get them to join your growing empire. If you go to war, there is no cunning military strategy, only who can spam the most troops to outnumber the other guy so you can take over. Needless to say, the diplomacy aspect needs work. I would tweak the "Sympathy" that town leaders have for you to increase more with gifts and to decrease slower over time. I'm playing a free game right now and will bribe 20,000 gold to a neutral town and only see sympathy increase by 1-2% with their leader. So, you'll throw loads of money at a town you're hoping to add to your empire with little result.\n\n- The military aspect is badly flawed. Troops are very expensive to maintain and will send you into debt if you recruit too many, competitors and NPC threats will most always be stronger and have more troops than you, troop morale drops quickly and will see your men fleeing from battle, and battles drag out for far too long. I would decrease the troop maintenance cost, add a leader character to accompany troops into battle to keep their morale from flagging, tweak the AI on how quickly competitors/NPC units can field an army, and change the battle schematics to not take years or just be a war of, "the winner is who has more troops than the other guy".\n\n- Towns are basically just lifeless entities that have no real living, breathing quality to them that lets you feel like you're there. Only the names really differentiate them. So, towns are essentially production centers, a market to sell goods, and a spreadsheet you can pull up. It would be much more life-like if there were more ambient sounds when you're zooming in on your towns to check them out (dogs barking, town crier telling the news of the day, etc) more animations of villagers hustling and bustling in the streets, and the ability to micromanage and develop your individual towns where it actually will alter their appearances based on your decisions.\n\n\nThat's all I have for now. At the moment, the game is a very bare bones, but a challenging trade sim....it delivers on that. However, it lacks big on personality and depth that makes you want to explore the world and spend countless hours getting lost in the medieval life of your empire.\n\n\nGrade:  4.5/10\n\n\n","September 30, 2015","false","57.4"," 32 of 53 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","32","53","0","0"

This is required because the the tutorials in the game do not really teach you how you should play\n- many of the core concepts of the game are good.\n\nThings i dont like\n- The AI is in my opinion overpowered to the point where i cannot beat it even at the lowest difficulty levels\n- personally i missed a "free build" mode in this game where i can just mess arround without any ais killing you.\n- the number of different reousrce buildings you can build is 20. This is enough to give the economy some dept but ithe production chain is a bit simple compared to other games such as the patrician series.\n- you cannot permanently kill beast lears/ bandit camps requiring you to micromange the military.\n- The militrary is relavily simple where the army with the biggest combat strength simply wins a battle. personally this is fine with me, but if you are going to buy this game then you would probably like to know this.\n\nOverall i would say that the game is pretty good, but not great, and not worth the 40 euros asked here on steam.

I think the tutorial should go more into depth because I really had to flounder a bit before I figured out how to do the basics.\n\nOnce you get your economy off the ground and have several cities, the game becomes a little on the tedious side.

It's more similar to Patricians than you first realize.  But after you start getting big you start to see there are differences between the two games, and in my oppinion enough to merit buying this game.\n\nOne thing to note is that the business purchasing aspect of the game is much easier to work with, in that they have really good information on all your towns in one tab.  So if you can see how much coal all your cities are producing and just add a few more buildings for coal, then once they're built you have more coal.  And I think that's why people don't recommend it, because they have made accessing your data much easier.\n\nI DO miss doing quests, technically you can do quests for other towns, but they are very few and far between, and I felt like there was always quests to do in Pat IV, but it's very fun to create your own cities and build them up.\n\nAll in all I really enjoy this game, and the trading aspect of things, if you're looking for a good trading/producing/town building simulator this one is great.\n\nOne last note that should be mentioned, the developers in this game are AWESOME.  They have noticed the negative reviews and stated that they are working hard to implement what the community has requested for free.  They have worked hard to release this game, they are quick to respond to bug reports in the forums, and they release patches on a regular basis.

Like Crusader Kings 2, you can’t just jump into it and expect to automatically understand; the mechanics, particularly in relationship to supply and demand, took several attempts for me to understand. Unlike the Tropico series the goal is not to produce as many goods as you can, but just as many as your towns consume, then link them up with merchants. Supply and demand can be discovered under the “All towns” tab in any city and once you have a trading route the money starts flowing in. After you’ve established a strong economy, it’s a blast using your massive financial reserves to manhandle other players or A.I.s; buy them out of their towns, amass a massive army, whatever you want to do. However, you will get bored of it after you understand it and have played a few hours over the last few days. Without a modding community through the Steam workshop, every map is basically the same or a subset of the same map of Afro-Eurasia. There are also goods that are not included in the game’s original 20 goods that might make an interesting addition, such as marble, incense, and spices.

Once you understand the economic system (which is fine and relatively simple once you have your head around it - it is HORRIBLY explained in game though) the game comes down to a repetitive cycle of "look at list of industry production vs used", "select relevant city", "build relevant industry", "look at list of industry production"...\nYour economy will crash the first few times you play, until you work out how the system works on your own (the tutorial will actually make it harder to learn).\n\nIt's so easy to get all the resources you need, without even thinking about it.  You can get a massive economy by trading within your own empire.  Anything outside of that is just with a handful of neutrals for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles.  There is no need or even reason to bother trading with another player.  Why help them? It doesn't help you (well... nowhere near enough to be worthwhile).\n\nThere needs to be more reason to continually expand.

One of the best i've ever played.\n\nNow i've read quite a few reviews on steam because the game was rated at 44% at the time i bought it and i found a couple of things quite curious:\n\n1) Nobody said the game was a buggy mess. Nobody talked about any bugs.\n2) Everyone complained about believing it was supposed to be just like Total Wars games with detailed combat plus the trading aspect.\n3) People complained about not enough products, 20 is too low a number for them. And you can reach all those products with 4 towns.\n4) The ai is pretty good, even your own. But it should be better!\n5) There is already a choice on the main menu for future dlc...\n\nAnd the game is rated 44% for actually working and being a very great TRADING game? And you will notice the bad reviews come from all those early adopter that bought the game when it got out in september. Oh my gawd! Not another company that LIED to us and didn't give us what they said they would do! Oh no! Honestly, the bad reviews read like little babies that didn't get what they wanted so they smashed the game while crying to their moms!\n\nNow, on to a far more balanced review from a guy who didn't know this game existed before 2 days ago and didn't expect anything from the developer:\n\n- This is a T.R.A.D.I.N.G game. You build towns and must satisfy their needs so they can grow and produce more products that you can sell to other towns to make them grow. You earn money from selling to your own town and other towns. That's the basic concept of a trading game. It looks boring as hell, but oh god it is not! The balancing of production to fullfill the needs of everyone and not overproduce too much is QUITE challenging.\n- The map is biiiiig. Sure you could in theory build only 4 towns that only trade among themselves and do nothing else. But what about the other gazillions cities out there? Most of the time, they are too far for even a lot of traders to supply efficiently. So you need to build more towns, closer to them to fullfill what they miss. Cluster of cities is the key here and is easier to manage too.\n- Only 20 products to manage is not enough? Some of those products take 1 or 2 other products (That are also consumed by the cities) to be produced. It soon become a holy mess of dynamic supply and demand from hell and it is insanely fun.\n- I think the war aspect is pretty good for this game. The game is a grand strategy like Europa Universalis and you don't go into details like strategic combat (Like the Total Wars series). And honestly, you don't want to. Just managing your empire takes all of your time, you don't have time to waste on tiny or even not so tiny skirmishes. You have an empire to feed! And when war happens, it's a whole other ballgame! Now you need to supply the troops in the field, send more troops as needed and still keep your cities happy! It's like ratcheting the difficulty level. Oh and the ennemy can just attack those nice traders of yours running around and just ruin your economy! Hehehehe\n- So battle is like spear - sword - axe - archer - horse with a bit better units as your research them. Nothing fancy but from a grand strategy point of view, everything is there. And for those who believe you only need spears, i'll send you a couple of swordsmen to destroy your huge army of spears and we'll talk after that.\n- The game has no bugs at all. It still received a patch december 15, which is better than a looooot of games out there.\n- The game is very well balanced and polished. The gui is pretty well done. I haven't found a place yet where i told myself that the gui should have a button that does this or should have this automated. Nope, it's all there and thought for.\n- The automation of your traders is pretty good. You tell them which town to supply and they do all the trading for you. You only need to watch when they fill up their max capacity and improve it from time to time. That way, you can spend your time fiddling with your production of goods which is where the real challenge is. You have many ways of automating the trader and even can specify things directly if you choose (like buy X goods at Y price at town A and sell it at Z price at town B), but the more you mess with the trader ai, the more you shoot yourself in the foot long term.... Hehehehe\n- The learning curve can be pretty steep, but if you play the campaign, it's a huge tutorial and very well done (Plus, you get laid ;-). I believe it's also a bit easy because when you overproduce a good by quite a bit, the price of the good doesn't crash too much which would have terrible consequences on your budget!\n- The game is realtime with adjustable time speed from pause, to x0.1, x0.5, x1, x3 and x10 speed. Since it's my first game, i play mostly on x1 speed and pause when needed.\n- There is research. As you improve your level you can improve 3 things. It is a basic affair but with deep consequences. You want to put points everywhere, but need to schedule what you really need first. A couple of high end products are not availables until you research them (like making clothes. everybody wear rucksack before that! ;-)\n- The graphics are very nice for a game that don't really needs them, but hey can't say no to eye candy when everything else is great.\n- The potential for adding new interesting stuff into the game is fantastic. I don't know how much the devs are going to go there, but it's intriguing what stuff they could add to it. Just a couple more products with interesting effects would add new challenges.\n- There is a diplomacy of sorts to ally with other towns, even militarily and eventually take them over by money(prefered and easier) or by force. Each town is quite independent unless you face a uber empire.\n- One of the few game where i still haven't got to bed at 3 AM and still don't want to go and i'm not tired because far too engrossed in the running of my empire! xD\n","January 7","true","34.8"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","12","18","0","0"

Now that I have it and played it several times, it turned out to be the disappointment I hoped it would not be.  First of all the economy system seems very unbalanced. The game concept is that you set up towns and grow your population by creating new businesses, hence the more business the more citizens in your kingdom. The problem is that more business leads to an excessive amount of goods produced which are not consumed by the population or cannot be consumed by all kingdoms combined [AI kingdoms included]. So you end up with too many goods and now where to sell them, run a budget deficit, can't recruit new unites or deploy your army unless your cash flow is positive again. On the other hand it makes  no sense to lower production of the goods that are being over produced because that will result in a smaller population , less tax and a faster way to financial ruin. The Devs need to act fast if they want to save this game.

I'll explain better.\nDIPLOMACY\nDiplomacy does not exist, I think also in Alfa Centaure there were more options. We are in the age of Crusader Kings II - really some kind of effort for this aspect could give some flavour.\nECONOMY\nThere is some resource management, and the economical model is nice (althought beoing not revolutionary - also less "ambitous" games like Cosmonautica have price / quantity variation).\nThe system good - road - merchant - prices has become repetitive and there is a plenty of games that have already showed up being unsuccessful just focusing on this (look Offtrade Company).\nThey simply become boring fast.\nWAR\nAs the dev declared this is not a war simulation so the model is what is is.\nGENERAL ASPECT\nIt is just a personal opinion, but this game totally lacks personality. The name is Medieval but the same game could be ambiented on the moon or in every other age and nothing would change. It lacks the flavour of CK2 or The Guild, not mentioning Anno.\nAt the end I find it overpriced for the containt.","September 27, 2015","false","3.1"," 28 of 49 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","28","49","0","0"

Automatic trade routes sucks (the "manual setting", which is actually a technological achievement, is good for nothing), interface is bad (you have to move your mouse just a bit to sell/buy 2 or 3 units more), and as other players have mentioned, diplomacy & warfare are close to non-existent (not to say some bugs when you're sieging 3 times the same robber cave).\n\nSo, it's just a simgame about trading, but with only few products, quite lousy interface & very bad AI traders (they buy & sell at stupid prices, and again, the manual setting won't change much). Sometimes you win millions, sometimes you lose them, but you never really understand why (the trick is just to close down your factories and wait a bit, hoping you're not having some fight on).\n\nLike most sim games, it is still fascinating.

I had really high hopes for it as a deep empire-building strategy game... what it appears to be so far is a micromanagement sim. This game makes features out of mechanics that many other games would automate, such as selling surplus goods to neighboring towns and buying up commodities that you aren't producing yourself. Want to unload your excess food onto your starving neighbors for some extra cash? Then you need to buy all the excess from your townspeople, load them onto a merchant wagon, wait until said merchant arrives at the neighboring town, then sell them your excess goods. A lot of work for what many games have reduced to a single button click or slider adjustment. Sure, you can set up automatic trade routes for your merchants, but production is never consistent enough to be able to rely on these, and even if it was I'm not sure what you would do in the mean time considering just how much of the game the trading mechanic makes up. Then there's the questionable "sympathy" guage, seperate from the actual relations guage, that is somewhat ambiguous and never seems to rise when it should. No big deal right? Wrong, good luck growing your empire beyond 3 towns without people able to consistently raise neutral towns sympathy ratings beyond 80. For these reasons and a few others I just can't recommend this game to anyone other than hardcore economy sim enthusiests as much as I was really excited for this game.","September 26, 2015","false","14.9"," 25 of 44 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","25","44","0","0"

One thing to realize is that you are not going to learn this title in a single play session.  There is a heavy emphasis on economics, trades, supply and demand as well as managing your overall production to influence your local markets and or crash your competitors markets.\n\nGiven the era this game is set within, there is a limited combat system but for the most part it consists of ensuring you distribute your units equally so that no matter what units you face you can enjoy bonus damage versus what ever units you encounter and combat.  That being said there is very little control beyond this once your engaged in combat save the option to flee which will then cause you're selected units to run home screaming all the way.\n\nWhile this is a real time strategy game, in many respects it's plays much more like a turn based game.  Insofaras, each "Week" triggers changes in the economic landscape prompting the player to check each of their cities to ensure that any overstocks are bought up by traders to ensure the local market price is preserved for next weeks production cycle.  In addition to this each city is capable of producing only five out of twenty commonities meaning that active trading is essential to economic viability.  However you can only produce a single trader per city and it can take many weeks to travel along any of the longer trading routes a player might setup.  It is very easy to give into temptation and 'fastforward" the game.  Which is a quick way to watch your economy crash.\n\nPay close attention to any city under your control that displays a red explamation mark.  It means trouble, and if your don't fix it quickly.  Well don't blame me for the results.\n\nIts fun, it's interesting, In two days I've already put in over 20 gameplay hours on this thing.  But it can also be frustrating, infuriating, and more difficult than it seems.  Overall a fairly realistic world domination sim as it might have been experienced in medieval europe, albeit with much more up to date information on locations that would normally yield up only months, or years old intel.","October 7, 2015","true","76.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

TW has emphasis on military with a backdrop of economy... this game is the opposite. Economy trade focus, and military runs in the background almost.\n\n\nto those who cant make money... you have to realize that every town consumes EVERY GOOD... and the larger the town the more consumption there is. towns can only produce 5 goods.  get better at trading. in fact... thats the whole design of this game, its awesome. Ive never had a bankruptcy problem in this game that wasnt my fault and i fixed it in due time.\n\nalso the bigger the traders are (the more carts they have) the more upkeep they cost. dont send out traders with a billion carts if they arent using all that cargo space.\n\nhave ONE... just one city with a warehouse with all goods.... all traders connect to that city. overproduce timber, bricks and metal wares (the are required for buildings not just consumption)\n\nnow heres the kicker... all that economy is nice, works well etc.... but then you get into war. its fairly simplified and the total war series blows it out of the water on the TACTICAL scale. on STRATEGIC scale.... this game is actually better than TW. the AI will attack you and attack you to win... cities get sieged when the opponent is weak. total war series always left me frustrated with neutered enemies that would blockade a port and NOTHING ELSE.\n\nthe tactical simplicity is actually a good thing IMO.... fewer options means more game focus on other things but most importantly the AI has fewer things to screw up.  all it has to do is allocate numbers to fight numbers, seige when not fighting. recruit and send reinforcements when possible. it does that brilliantly. gal civ series, civ 4, Total war series... all have failed to do what this games strategic AI can do. gal civ maybe could do it. starcraft 2 ai is also good.\n\nthis game is amazing... ive been allied with an AI so i could see what they were doing... they were at war and all along their front they were fighting\n\ni havent played at the highest difficulty yet, but the only weakness is the AI has yet to declare war on me. i build up in peace while theyve been fighting each other for a long time.\n\n","October 5, 2015","true","66.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

All I can say is that ppl are expecting too much too fast for the first release of this game. This is not Grand Ages: Medieval IV... it is the first one. All I have to say to those with such a negative outlook of the game is to think of all the wonderful games on their first release...they were not so amazing now were they? It took expansion packs, patch releases, etc. Give this one the same chance to work on it before writing such harsh judgements (the patch made to this game has already been released and fixed some of the issues/concerns identified in a very expedited manners, demonstrating how serious the developers are to make this game great). I decided to purchase the game disregarding the comments after looking at the various walkthrough and comments from SERIOUS players, not from those who just want everything handed out to them. This is a trading game and it should be about macro management, patience, strategies, etc. Please do not dumb the game too much. As for the army/warring aspect of the game, well, I want a trading game. If I want a war game, I would buy Age of Empires.\n\nThere are some areas, of course, that do require improvement. Here are my observations so far:\n\n- The slide system for selling/buying goods is not very friendly, especially if you want to set a very odd/specific numbers.\n\n- True, the list of commodities is not really representative for the size of this map and would suggest adding more variety to the list. In medieval time, milk/eggs/bronze/silver/iron/beef, etc (you get my drift) were common commodities.This might generate various buildings such as Metalsmith, milkfarms, etc.\n\n- Notification system: I would love to see a similar alarm notification system for mayor missions and disasters as the one used for attacks or diplomacy discussion.\n\nSo far, I am very pleased with the game and I am sure the developers are more than happy to improve it since they seems to enjoy playing it as well.\n\nI would give this game a 4 / 5 so far.","January 24","true","31.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

It is my belief that those people who wrote a bad review, went into the game expecting a full on strategy war game. Let me say this, the game is a simulation game with many bonuses. If you play this game expecting a simulation game you will be very pleased with the extras that the developers have thrown in. I am enjoying the time with this game and spend afk time considering what my next move will be.\nLet me offer a little advice to get you started, upgrade your products as quickly as possible so you have the full variety of merchandise to distribute to your cities. Keep your trade routes small to mid range and make sure that the route has most products available to purchase. If you go for a high end product in a city, pomp for example, make sure the same city is producing the other items needed to produce that item.\nWhen considering placement of a new city, think about what is available on the map around it. Is there access to fish, fur, metal or coal. Can you use these items for a more expensive product and will it fit into the current trade routes you have in the area?\nTake time to play the campaign. It will teach you some of the basics but there is still a lot for you to learn on your own and that is one of the joys of playing a new game. Try different things and if it doesn't work, well then you learn and add to the replayability of the game.\nI definately recommend this game. Have fun building your economy and buying out your competitors. Oh, and if that doesn't work, build an army and seige thier cities until they submit.","April 7","true","31.6"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

Keeps me thinking and easy to get lost in....once you get the hang of it. It took me at least 4 starts to be able to get things off the ground somewhat efficiently. It takes time, a lot of time, to do things well in this game and keep pace witht the pc. That's how I want it, but it can be discouraging at times. It's got it's minor issues and things I want adjust but that goes for pretty much any strategy game out there. They said they haven't encrypted anything so it's possible to be modded and I do look forward to people tweaking a few settings, early game is rough once a military becomes necessary. Even so I've finally gotten a good game rolling and am loving the challenge of this game. Finally taken over a few towns, and more or less keeping pace with the PC factions who grow rapidly even on normal.\n\nSome may find combat a little underwhelming. It is pretty simple compared to the trading system. It basically always comes down to who has the better economy as battles can go on for years as you cycle troops in and out while trying not to go broke and expand at the same time. Honestly there's so much going on with the economy and expanding that you don't need to get dragged into the finer details of combat. I do wish there was more feedback for what is going on with the battles, That can actually be said for lots of things in the game. I'd really like more infomation on mouse over of many values because it can be really hard to figure out the breakdown of variables going into them.\n\nIs the game perfect, of course not, but I'm finding it really complex and entertaining, even if I did spend hours getting my ♥♥♥ handed to me.","September 28, 2015","true","66.6"," 15 of 27 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","15","27","0","0"

If you are a dedicated strategy gamer and like trade, ecoomy and strategy you should give it a look.  The highpoints are placing cities, planning your expansion, and building up a strong trade network.  Using trade and diplomacy to take over cities is a fresh twist.  The early game is fun and the AI is good.\n\nThe current weakness is the end game- it turns into a grind.  You can have an overwhelming advantage and it still takes a long time to gain control of all the regions.  One idea- give the player a slider and make it customizable how many regions you need to control.  Combat is limited, but for me it's good enough to compliment the other elements of the game.

The Trading and the combat are mobile device quality without all the flashy things to click on.\nThe military untis are meh. The combat is just send your troops blindly into combat until the enemy gets tired of hacking them down the key is to keep sending MOAR troops to blindly die. At first I would watch the fight and retreat soldiers that were dieing and send fresh troops in but that got boring so I just sent waves of soldiers at anything that wanted to fight. (It helped out that I had over 140 000 000) Also the barbarian hordes constantly are a problem when you expand to 20+ cities. I came up with a strategy: after destroying there village I would errect a defense tower on top of there dead corpses to remind them that there maw beaches.\n\n\nIts an easy game once you understand how to manipulate the Trade routes properly. Start a route with 4 close cities (as many as you want really as long as there not producing the same materials... unless the demand is so high you need multiple cities producing the same product) let the trader run the route a few times then click on the trader on the bottom left there is a barrel "Change Route Analysis". Once the trader has ran the route a few times he will have a good representation of the supply and demand on the route then add production slowly untill you get a feel for it add lots of carts to your traders (carts are built at the inn and have to be individually added to your trader)\n\nI was going to give this a Yes for recomendation then I wrote this review and even though I did enjoy the game it doesnt sound like I enjoyed it and the more I think about it I can not recomend this game unless it was cheap.","September 28, 2015","false","25.5"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

The initial storyline is interesting but way too easy, The world is too small and there are too few resources. 5 per town and 20 total. You can make as many of those buildings in a town as you could want and in theory control those goods for the entire map. The world is just too small for a game of this scale. I defeated an empire out of Russia and controlled half the map just from capturing his capitol. You can control an area on the map with 5 towns. The economy makes no sense. I add up on my own all my income vs expensives and should be well into the green, instead I am losing money, much more than should be possible. The military units are very expensive for the small bonuses they provide and are just used for zerg rushing. You can have an entire army and only a few units will attack (I had 138 units but maybe 25% were actually fighting). The morale portion of combat is interesting but can be crippling. I had units that suddenly retreated and were stuck in a town because they had no replacements. Unfortunately that town was bugged (Vlore) and I ended up having to just dismantle those units. While this was happening, a rival empire decided to attack me. All my units were stuck in a town and I had no way of replacing them in time to save my city. The year is 1050 and there are no religious wars, really? This is a time of crusades and violent political wars.\n\nThis game has a lot of potential and I hope the devs improve, but it is just too simple and easy to beat at the moment. Increase the map size, add more building types, add more resource types. Add more stories, During the middle ages there could be a mission for a crusade, or to defend against crusaders. Add more political and religious factions.\n\nIf you played Grand Ages Rome, this product went in a completely different direction.","October 4, 2015","false","34.4"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

But what made the game totally unplayable for me is the military part of the game which has taken the brunt of the worst reviews as well.\n\nTo start... The upkeep cost of the units are too much, at least in the start of the game... By the time you have an econnomy strong enough to support a large army, you are already making enough money to take over town peacefully, which in turn actually takes a lot shorter time. Here is the worst part of the game. You don't control armies or give them any directions besides pointing in a general direction and make them go there. and if they are intercepted by anything... Be it an enemy unit, a wild animal, or a scout... The entire army will attack it... Which i can kinda take... What I can't take is that a single battle takes... Months... and I'm not exagerating... I had a mission to conquer an enemy town by military force, Knowing the flaw of the combat system, I lined said town with troops before I declared war... And GO! I besieged the town, but the defences were too great, so I had to periodically recall wounded soldiers home to heal, a system that usually works... however bandits and wild animals blocked my path between my town and the enemy town... so now I have three enemy units blocking my way... and as I mentioned earlier, for some reason, a single battle takes months to complete... so while I had an entire relief force on the way to besiege the enemy town, a pack og wolves and bandits were able to hold my army at bay long enough for my besieging troops to die off... Once I had dispatched the wolves and bandit and continued on to the town... I had to re-besiege the town again, and the patch got more animals back to block me, holy hell! no, I quit the game after noticing the failed siege took over half a year, while I know sieges can be long lasting.... fighting off wolves with cavalry, swordsmen, and archers shouldn't take months.\n\nI want this game to work, but unless a patch comes out, I won't play this game anymore.","September 28, 2015","false","14.2"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Turns out it is just another Patrician game.  I like Patrician games so I gave it a pretty good try.  After having played the campaign and then conquering the entire known world in free play I can say without a doubt that this is the worst of the Patrician clones.  It's such a regressive step back from the old games it's not even fit.\n\nThere is no manual battle mode.  In previous games you manual battled with ships.  In this game you have land troops.  Having a manual battle like Total War or Nobunga's Ambition just makes so much sense.  But it doesn't have it.  Instead you just rally your armies to a battle location until eventually you win or lose that location.\n\nThe trade is way less complicated but more tedious than previously.  The manual trade is unlocked later on and the automatic trade is simply better.  There's never a real point in using manual trade as automatic routes will always work out better.  Instead you tediously have to build up "carts" to add to your merchants.  You can only have a merchant per city so you're adding insanely high amounts of carts to each trade route.\n\nHaving gotten to the point where I capped out my capital at $999,999,999 it seems like the game breaks down at this point.  There is a cap on how many buildings you can build (albeits a high one), the neutral partners can no longer be bribed without it instantly resetting to older levels, and competitors seem to avoid war while expanding instead.\n\nOverall the game is very disappointing and not worth it.  Save your money and get Rise of Venice instead.  It's the same rough experience except it's more polished, has more features, and allows for far more.\n\nThe only nice thing about the game is that you can build your own cities, and it's a giant map.  Being able to see your cities grow is an amazing feature.  However it doesn't quite fit in with the trading simulator aspect of it.","October 4, 2015","false","61.5"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","6","10","2","0"

I won't go as far as saying its a terrible game but for the cost of it, it really does lack.\n\n-The music is bland and uninspiring. Might as well turn it off and put your own music on.\n-The combat is as others have said uncontrollable. I had sent out a mercenary unit to fight bandits and it literally took weeks of ingame time to have them fight, and they still lost, to BANDITS. Heaven help if you fight against another city state's military.\n- The economics seem broken as i'll have something like 70k of gold but keep loosing money and thats without the red ! telling me that i'm running deficits. I have the max number of traders with lots of carts going to every city that most of the other cities are at least doing well and dont have any buildings except an inn and at least 1 production building for each of the 5 production slots. Like another reviewer mentioned your finances always seem to be on the brink but when you build a military unit (which you'll need to do to fight bandits robbing your caravans) it seems to put you over into the red.\n-Graphics are ok. They are not crazy awesome. I expected to zoom in to the villages and really see great detail but its just kinda blah.\n-True the game doesnt crash, but for a game that offers rather bland content and a game that costs as much as this one did, I would expect it wouldnt.\n\nMy personal lesson learned: no more pre-orders of games without actually playing a demo or an early release of the game. Certainly not for a game that had cost as much as this one. I'd think if the game cost $10-$15 maybe $20 it wouldnt be so bad, but the $33 i paid for it as a pre-order and their regular asking price of $40 well thats just too much.\nI do not recommend this game. If you like this sort of strategy game, buy one of the Total war series or Civilization. I dont think this game will improve as they've made their money and the developers are probably onto the next dev project imho.","September 26, 2015","false","6.6"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

In the same way that the Total War series is more appealing to a mass audience than the Europa Universalis series, GAM appears to be a very niched game that isn't for everybody. I have played the game a little but watched plently of pre-release streams.\n\nA large portion of the criticism of GAM has been deserved:\n- Combat tactics are non-existent, battles basically come down to who has more numbers.\n- Diplomacy is overly simplistic, even if this is a trading simulator.\n- It appears to me that my income derives mainly from selling goods to my own citizens rather than actual trade with other cities. The trade with other cities appears to only be for the purposes of obtaining different goods that drive my prosperity up.\n- In the features listed on Steam the game world is described as "gigantic" and consisting of over "20 million square kilometres". While this might be the actual area of the terrain that the region of Europe covers in reality, GAM is by no means something on the level of an open-world game or even a massive scale game. While not entirely inaccurate, this contributes to the game representing that it is something, yet delivering something else.\n\nThe issue here is that the game was overhyped with the gaming community having the impression that GAM would be this amazing offspring combining the best elements of games like Total War or Europa Universalis. GAM is certainly NOT what some of the reviews I read made it out to be before release.\n\nHaving said all this, I don't believe it is fair to place all the blame on Kalypso. There were numerous pre-release streams available for us to check out and decide for ourselves what the game actually was. Yes, most of the negative reviews of the PC version I have read came after release, but it's not like Kalypso attempted to hide anything about the game pre-release.\n\nI do hope to see marked improvements in the diplomacy system. I also feel that the combat system should be removed entirely if there is no feasible way to include some degree of tactics or strategy (however, I'm thinking something like what Europa Univeralis has for battles might be work pretty well).\n\nMy thumbs up also stems from my belief that there is great potential for the game and it eventually will turn into something great. It would appear that a lot of the imbalances and problematic mechanics can be fixed with patches in the future. We will have to wait and see if Kalypso does keep its promise to improve the game and release some of the smaller content updates as free DLC.\n\nIn its current state I'd give this 6.5/10 (again highlighting that I enjoy this type of game and it's personal perference). If improved I believe it will turn out into something special.","October 1, 2015","true","6.6"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","10","18","0","0"

They're not bad, but nothing really sticks out. Character portrats and animations are terrible\n- Music is good, but overall audio design is fairly bland\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- Despite playing the tutorial, which introduces most things, the game really doesn't tell you how to effectively balance your  economy. There is a lot of trial and error.\n- Kalypso Launcher DRM is worlds better than, say, Uplay, but I don't know why companies bother these days.\n- There is no faction diversity for the most part. Expect to fight a lot of mirrors of your build and cities.\n\nFinal Verdict: This game is fun, and with a few patches, can be a truly great game. It does a lot of things good, but many games do those things much better. Bottom line: If you want to play a citybuilder game with a heavy emphasis on trade and combat, play Anno 2070. It does everything this game does, but does it better. Still not a bad middle ages trading/management sim though.\n\n","September 25, 2015","true","4.3"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","12","22","0","0"

This is NOT a City Builder game like the other Grand Ages titles were. I heavily recommend watching a couple Gameplay Videos before buying the game. Dont buy this game expecting to get another Grand Ages: Rome.\n\nOnto the Review!\n\nAbout the game:\nGAM plays in a no-fantasy medieval Europe. The player starts out as a humble trader, and slowly works his way up to noble and later even Emperor. The basic Gameplay consists of managing your towns. You construct different businesses and a handful of different support buildings (Warehouses to store more wares, a Church to raise the maximum population etc.). Meanwhile you send out Traders, trying to make a profit trough the basic "Buy low, sell high"-principle. Competitors or neutral mayors can be contacted via a basic diplomatic system, allowing for trade or transit agreements, alliances and of course, war. Towns can be conquered diplomatically, by making yourself popular in the city you'd like to have, and then integrating them into your own empire. On the other hand they can also simply be conquered. However, standing armies are costly and battles can take a considerable amount of time. So War may not be the go to solution every time. You also have the option to found towns yourself. Settlers can be recruited to found a town of your own, with different ressources being avaiable depending on where you settle down.\n\nThe good:\n\n- The game is fairly easy to get into. You might go into the red on your first and second try, as it's easy to overspend on buildings and diplomacy. But it only took me about an hour to get into it. Menus and controls are straightforward and easy to understand.\n\n- The game looks very nice. You can opt to get a birds-eye view from above, which is very useful when planning trade-routes or just getting a good look at your ever expanding empire. Or you can zoom in all the way and watch your subjects go about their work.\n\n- The Campaign is well done, with good looking cutscenes and a fully voiced narration. It takes you trough every part of being a ruler, introduces new concepts one step at a time, and adds a nice background story to it.\n\n- There's a fair variety of military units, depending on which region you're in. It's based on a simple rock, paper, scissors principle, with every unit being strong against one type and weak to another. A decent army composition can win even when outnumbered. So simply spamming wont get you the crown.\n\n- The development system is simple, but satisfying. It's your choice if you'd rather focus on more production, better roads (so your traders get around faster) or developing better military. The amount of different wares increases over time, and so does unit variety. The game branches out the longer you play.\n\nThe bad:\n\n- Managing larger empires can be a hazzle. There is no easy way to manage all your trade routes, beyond a simple menu that either shows each of your traders, or each individual trading route. A big overview of all your current routes and what is transported on them would've been nice.\n\n- Wild animals and bandits can be incredibly annoying. Bandit fortresses can spawn upwards 2000 people. With the relative cost of troops it's very possible that you have to deal with repeated raids over the course of a couple hours, until you have decent units and enough money to support them. Animals spawn randomly around the map and will scare off Traders, causing them to drop their wares. You can get them back easily, which is fine initially. But once your property spans across multiple regions it becomes incredibly annoying to hunt all those fu*kers down. Animals also seem a little too strong, with a couple Lynxes being able to wipe the floor with most basic units, making it necessary to hunt simple animals with half an army. It would've been cool if patrolling was a thing, or being able to set up guards for your traders.\n\n- The game can come off as a little to easy for veterans of the genre. Once you get the basic concepts down, it's very easy to sit at around 1 mil in cash. At a certain point deep into it, the game becomes a formality of just buying the same upgrades in every town and watching the numbers raise. If you want a challenge, you'll probably find it in multiplayer.\n\n- More of a personal gripe, but I was dissapointed to see that the towns show very little visual represantation of the stuff you build. It would have been great to watch some big, buzzling towns, crawling with people. But the Towns in GAM stay rather small and undimpressive. This is especially sad for big cities like Constantinopel, where I expected to see some eye candy. It reduces the fun I get from watching my Empire grow.\n\n- The game as a whole suffers a little from wasted potential. It's functional, and what it tries to do it get's done. But it's nothing overly special. Many areas could have been expanded upon, and it lacks the long-term replayability that games like Europa Universalis or Crusader Kings offer. Compared to some of the more meaty contestants in the genre, it's also much simpler and less deep.\n\nTL/DR:\n\nA great game for people who enjoy games like EU or CK, but want it a little simpler. It could have been a lot more, but also a lot less. If you're unsure about it, wait for a sale. I'd personally pitch the game at around 20 Dollars to get the most bang for your buck.","September 25, 2015","true","6.7"," 18 of 34 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","18","34","2","0"

You settle cities for resources, build buildings for production, and so on. The combat side to the game is rather simplistic and expensive, the combat system could use a bit of work.\n\nRegion specific resources would be a nice addition too, but it's not urgent. Alot of people complain about, how depthless the game is, or how it's too difficult and you always end up with massive debt. Not true. The game has alot of depth with the porsperity system and trading system. Trying to supply a town with all it's required resources, and distribute the produced resources is a challenge in it's self.\n\nThe game has a steep enough learning curve, however, after I played my first game and went on to my second one, I had the trading system down. I quickly gained a large cash flow and expanded like wildfire. Then I built a huge army and wrecked the AI.\n\nThis game is for people who like Europa Universalis, Crusader Kings and such. It's a niche game which admittly could use a couple of additions, and a combat revamp but, I still really enjoyed playing it.","January 4","true","9.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Once hub produced metal and the other consumed it to make goods.  The consuming cities were not producing their goods because they were short metal.

Devs- please add ALOT more goods like triple what you have try adding different weapon types as goods (maybe even require these goods for troops) try adding silk, spices, milk, cheese, cows, goats, pigs, chickens, eggs, bread (you already have pastries but bread would be just grain), different types of armor, horses, clay, paper, ink or dyes, sugar, crabs, pearls, gold, silver, split up the metal into copper,  and iron, add whales, tea, cotton, cocao, split up the different fruits, ale, whiskey, mead, (this should all be free too because the trade system was supposed to be complex but it's not) Those are just some ideas on trade goods to add to help gameplay.\n\nTrade goods are not regional, so you can get everything all in one area. There is no need to really expand too far or trade with anyone outside of your empire except early on. Devs- please make the goods more exclusive to areas.\n\nProfit margins still need some work. You do not make enough money to cover expenses and actually turn a profit, partially because of the lack of variety and under use of goods in towns (make towns consume more), which causes saturation of the market.\n\nCombat needs to be spiced up. Devs-Make up formations and such. You could set it up to where archers can be flanked and wiped out for instance. Add more troops types. Add the ability to patrol areas to troops or make towers have garrisons that patrol between pairs of towers. With this, you could increase bandit activity for them to fight. Take away the heavily armed and armored bandits for some lighter geared guys. Let's be honest, bandits rarely had full mail, shields and swords.\n\nAdd more buildings in cities and maybe take away 1 or 2 types of production in each city IE: drop it from 5 to 4 or 3, to encourage more cities. Make cities revolt or something to add some depth. You could make buildings increase happiness or order as in the TW series and cause other factors decrease it. Add cultural and religious factors to make cities have more depth.\n\nThis game has tons of potential and I'm still hopeful that it will become one of my favorites but it really needs some addition content that should mostly be free. I do not mind paying for some of it like maybe different troop types or something but the trade is the biggest issue since this is a trading game. This game should be Civilization, Total War, and Port Royale mixed into one insanely fun game but for now, it needs more content added badly. I can see this with only 10 hours of playing time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","October 4, 2015","false","32.9"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

So either the game mechanics aren't polished right now, or their values are off.\n\nI would not recommend this game unless you know exactly what you're doing and absolutely LOVE this style of game.\nIf you're looking for more Comabt-based games, this isn't for you.\nSave your money.\nIf you're looking for hours of trading and boring times of doing nothing, then this game is for you.","September 26, 2015","false","96.4"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

To peole who want to know what this is about\nMost of the bad reviews on the game right now are because people didn't search properly and were expecting a city building and/or total war type game. This is not that, if you are looking for that then dont buy this game and get dissapointed. This is a trading simulation game mostly simillar to Patrician 4 (and other games like port royal series and rise of venice). The goal of the game is to become succesful in producing, distributing goods in cities  so they prosper and make a profit out of it. Most other aspects of the game like the campaign story, war, raids etc are just small additions. So if you want to play a war game or city building this is nto for you. If you want to try out economy sim games then this is the newest addition in the genre.\nkey points: Short campaign that is purpose is to teach you game mechanics. Trading sim as its core, war/raid armies as a flavour.\n\n2. Pros and cons  (this part i write for veterans of previous titles, to hopefully make the review helpful for them too)\nPros:\n- huge map , i mean really huge map comparing to everything these games have offered so far. Map is also nicely partitioned in regions that offer you a title etc. Also option to only isolate the game on any part of the map you wish (if you dont like huge map)\n-addition of technologies\n-improved graphics, decent soundtrack\n\nCons:\n- You don't view the city in detail to build it (like in patrician 4), that is no problem with me to be honest, especially since there are so many cities you could build\n-The trading part seems a bit simplified. For one the option to keep products in the warehouse is gone. And the whole gameplay mechanics of figuring out efficient ways to organise trade (keep warehouses locking products, only selling on max prices etc) is gone too. So the automatic system the AI uses seems like the best choice...maybe with a few interventions of a manual trader.\n\nGenerally i'd recommend this game if you want to play economy sim, you will most probably enjoy it\n","September 25, 2015","true","68.5"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","8","15","0","0"

I find the learning curve to be pretty steep as the tutorial only serves to help users understand the bare basics of the game. I'd recommend most new players play the campaign before setting out on multiplayer or an open game. I chose to play an open game simply because I learn better through trial and error and multiplayer rather than campaigns.\nComparable Games: Victoria II, Civ 5\n\nGraphics:4/5\nNo doubt the game isn't absolutely stunning in terms of graphical appearance, but it is ultimately very smooth in all graphical aspects. There have been some reported issues with Nvidia gpus and I am running a R9 390X and have not experienced a single issue running the game on any setting.\n\nCombat: 3/5\nCombat here could be positive or negative depending on what you're looking for. I find the combat to be exactly as it is in Civ 5. Each unit earns exp, can become stronger as it "levels up" and winning or losing fights depends on a unit's combat strength. Luckily there is a retreat feature for units in combat, so your units won't simply die right away like they do in Civ 5 if you're presented with a poor matchup. As of now, combat isn't great, but it certainly isn't terrible.\n\nAudio: ?/5\nI honestly haven't really been paying attention to the sound all too much as of yet. I've been entirely focused on learning all aspects of advancing my settlement. I'll update this later on.\n\nContent: 3/5\nSo as expected of the growing trend from gaming companies in the last few years, most games are presented in a bare bone fashion with the potential grow based on sales of the product. Since this is the vanilla version of the game, there isn't a vast amount of content readily available. I imagine with expansions the game will get much better than it currently is.\n\nThe main issue I'm having so far is with trading and economics. Combat is simple, but growing your settlements isn't simple whatsoever. Your settlement is given the option to produce 5 products in each town that you create. You upgrade them just like you do in Vic 2, you aquire the needed resources, wait a period of time, and businesses will begin to attract workers to your town. Based on the overall supply and demand of the products within your towns, the prices of goods will vary.\n\nMy first few runs through I tried some rapid expansion and found that ultimately, I was trying to accomplish too much too quickly. I've tried both quick expansions wide and tall and found them to put myself in terrible situations later in the game. Understanding economics and the limitations of your settlements is key to success. It really is. Also, having scouts roaming around is very helpful. "Ancient ruins" as similar to those of Civ 5, spawn on the map randomly, granting resources and money.\n\nGameplay: 4.5/5\nNo doubt, I've been playing Civ 5 a lot and found the game to be quite simple once you understand the basics of your preferred strategy. Victoria II is a much more difficult game for me as the economics aspect is much more real. I give GAM a 4.5/5 in gameplay because of how smooth the game actually is. The game is live RTS just like Victoria II, you can speed up or slow down the game according to your own pace. There's no lag when experiencing a lot of interaction on the map. GAM is ultimately an unforgiving Grand Strategy game basically taunting all strategy lovers with the most basic question as you grow your settlement with the intent to conquer Europe: are you good enough to win?\n\nThe challenge is good enough to keep me interested until I can conquer Europe on an open game mode. Also looking at this very idea from a time value of money perspective. The game is roughly $40 USD. In order to make the game worth the cost of buying it at minimum wage of $7.50 USD, a player would have to play GAM for roughly 5 and a half hours. That said, the game has proven to be worth my money even without the vast amount of readily available DLC which will most likely come later on.\n\nAll hail Brittania!","September 26, 2015","true","13.2"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","9","17","0","0"

If I want strategic combat, I'll play the TW series. If I want more in debth trading, I'll play one of the many space sims out there. If I want a relaxing empire builder with toned down elements of all that is related to 4X games, in medieval times no less, I'll play Grand Ages: Medieval.","September 26, 2015","true","3.7"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","9","17","0","0"

People seem to be upset it isnt like total war... idk why they thought it was gonna be the same i sure as a hell didnt.  The economy is challenging, but if its going south you have ample time to fix it as it isnt immediate debt its "okay i lost 2k this week im going to lose 3k next week, whats wrong and how do i fix it."  People are saying the economy has no depth, the fact that its supply and demand makes it have depth.  You produce goods to meet the demands when you start to be producing excess you have options.  1. expand and find new markets or 2. drop the production and create a demand for it.  Military is meh, but it isnt suppose to be in the spotlight. (atleast not yet i have a feeling because of all the hate they're change the war aspect)  The one thing i think that NEEDS to be changed is the upkeep on the troops.  Its almost more profitable to let the bandits just pillage your trader than it is to pay for the men to keep them safe.  or maybe i just suck at making money and think 1k a week is a lot while others may think its chump change.\n\n","September 26, 2015","true","46.9"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","9","17","0","0"

Review done.\n\nOh alright, let me add a bit of rationale then.\n\n1.  The user interface takes 4 clicks or more for things which should take 1. Very badly designed indeed.\n2.  It has combat in it with no options and no strategy\n3. It has diplomacy in it with no options and no strategy\n\nThis seems to have been an attempt to make an accessible strategy game. It does have its charm, it looks pretty and it is more accessible than most strategy games of late.  However, someone should have said that when people want "accessible" they dont mean, nothing behind a pretty bit of nothing.   Or at least I didnt.  I thought this might be a bit like settlers but learning some lessons from that in terms of being a bit more open, having some progression and being a bit less linear in many respects.\n\nIt isnt. Its light on content, options and any much to do after a certain point.  It is like a child of a friend or relative that is really annoying but cute.  Cute wears off, annoying never does.\n\nOne way to overcome it would be to add some depth and character.  The depth just doesnt seem to be there.  A real shame as I can see so many ways this could have been so much better. I am no game designer so I imagine those that are know what they are but were not permitted to develop some of the aspects of the game which seem about 40% done.  This feels like an early access waiting for content.","December 2, 2015","false","7.3"," 14 of 27 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","14","27","0","0"

It is almost strictly a trading game, not at all comparable to Civ5.  Its comparable to Kalypso medias Port Royal 3: Pirates, only there’s no combat like there was in that game.  I like the concept of growing from a small village to a major force, BUT…\n\nHere’s a hint why some people are frustrated.  If you look at the slides advertising the game it show armies, vast “terrifying” armies and fleets (“armadas”).  I played enough to take over France and Spain and I could barely afford a single squad let alone an army.  That’s it.  Forget the military option, you can never afford it.  I made a couple of squads and they went to fight some bears.  You can watch the weeks tick by on a timer on the screen.  I estimate that these two squads (my entire army) fought those bears for two months before they won.  The only option I had was to run away.   No control over the squads.   If you’re going to advertise armies make it an integral part of the game.  Don’t lie.\n\nDiplomacy is essentially trading with a neighboring town, then paying them off.  Since you rarely have any money, it takes a long time.\n\nGraphics are nice; it’s got a great zoom feature on the little hamlets.  They probably spent a little too much time on this and not enough on the mechanics.  By the way, I see a number of people are having problems with Nvidia graphic cards.  Beware.  I have an ATI card and have not run across any bugs or crashes so it is solid from that angle.\n\nPeople play the game for 4 hours and say it’s great.  It is fun for 3 or 4 hours.  Unfortunately, shortly after that they realize that’s it.  It just continues on this repetitive grind of trading.\n\nI don’t think it would take a lot to fix the game, increase the income, lower the military costs, diplomacy hmmm … got some work to do there, but hey that’s what troops are for.\n","September 26, 2015","false","58.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

It's a shame soo many people purchased this thinking it was Total War or some other game...\n\nTo describe this game... It's a mix of some of the following games:\n\nVenice/Patrician III/Patrician IV [series] (trade)\nHegemony series (Supply lines)\nKnights Of Honor (with updated graphics, but slightly dumbed down/simplistic combat)\nParadox Games styled combat\n\nThis game is not:\nCOD (Call of Duky, which I will admit I like... but this is not it)\nTotal War (been a fan since the original Shogun... The combat is closer to games like Super Power 2)\nParadox Strategy games (love them and own most of them, but the economy is not "all connected")\n\n\nI give it a 8.5/10.\nThe Good... I like the Patrician III/IV economy, which is almost 100% in your control (other's merchants can buy your stuff [i think]). The combat... well, lets be honest, is a lot like risk... but with a heavy weight given to class (much like paradox games, some troops do better vs a specific type).\n\n\nThe bad... Well, most people don't like to wait to build their economy (looking at you COD players) before they can build a massive one-sided zerg (like Darkfall). Lastly, the devs need to make a little video on how to develop your economy (for those of you/like me who don't like reading to figure out how to play the game a purchased 1+ weeks back).\n\n\nOnce you play it a few hours (which you will need... as well as restarting a few times) you can build a proper network on cities and traders to balance your resources...

It's really sad that this game is getting such awful reviews. Most of those awful reviews are people who didn't actually see what the game was before purchasing it and are giving it a bad review for it not being a TTW or Civ5 game. A lot of people are also making the mistake of this as a successor to Grand Ages: Rome.

The issue is that you need to constantly be patroling for them because if the bandits start stealing all your merchants goods you can go from a groing cash pile to one in the red real quick. And if the bandit camp was allowed to grow in neutral or competitor territory it can be very difficult to eliminate\n\nNow I have not progressed enough to know everything about the game, so disregard my compaints if they happen to already be there and I just dont know it.\n\n1st- The game needs a recomended help/tip on resource buildings in a town to help guide people as they grow their empire\n2nd- The game needs an automated patrol action for military units\n3rd- Military units through discovery or size of empire either need to cost less in upkeep or they need to scale up as you go, an example of something good would be that you get 1 unit at reduced upkeep per city, or when in range of a city\n4th- This might be there already. but seige weapons need to be put in to reduce siege times,\n\nSo The Pros= Graphics(Really are good enough), Program Stability (No Problems so far)\n\nCons=Military upkeep difficuty, The trade and econmic system being slightly cumbersom at the beggining and potentianaly tedius as you grow. And the fact that the screenshots advertised make it look like battles are more of an RTS style than a Civ/Risk style.\n\nWould I Recomend this game. Yes, if you like this type of game, you will most definetly enjoy it, if your not sure its your thing then watch some videos, and put it on your wishlish and wait till its at a cost that to you, it dosnt matter if you like it or not.","September 26, 2015","true","11.4"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","4","8","0","0"

It also capably juggles the trading that the ANO series had with a little more depth and automation. It took a few hours to get used to the system but I did manage to make it to nobleman in my second game.\n\nThere are problems at the moment though, balance in the combat department is sorely needed.\n\n-Bandits are insanely powerful. If you aren't fielding about 3 to 1 troops it will take months of in game time to kill and for some reason they can hold off your units until the last man.\n\n-Bandit Camps, which I asume spawn bandits, are guarded by a force double that of my empire, so Im not sure if I should have been flieding about 30 units at a time, but they had at least 10 units and they do not go down easy.\n\n-Animals are very confusing, they are seemingly one of the most effective bandits in the game, constantly traking down and chasing traders losing me a lot of profit. So animals with no leaders or formations should be relatively easy to kill, right? Nope. slightly better with a 2 to 1 ratio rather than 3 to 1, but I find my armies losing hundreds of men to combat with a group of lynxs. I don't have the best knowledge of how militaries worked in medieval times but I think that I could lead 300 guys with swords, axes, and bows against some forest cats and come out on top without needing hundreds of reinforcements.\n\nI find myself with the question of what theyre trying to simulate here. Searching/hunting for the creatures? Some kind of wider infestation of creatures? It doesn't make much sense to me that they aren't even routed at some point and take half my unit's health down.\n\n-Combat time/siege time it takes extremely long to fight/kill/takeover anything. 1 capable but single town kingdom took 3 years of constant siege (siege timer over 11k) was able to produce peasant units wo delay me, and even with 8 to 1 it was taking so long to run out their timer and so long to kill their 1 unit spawning every minute or two that after 3 years I couldnt keep up the siege and ran out of money.\n\n-micromanagement requirements. Having to rotate out units after combat is ok, as long as the loss was meaningful. I had to  rotate units more than 30 times over the course of the siege and still made very little headway. Ran out of money, morale dropped, units route, siege timer goes back up. It was very disheartening.\n\n\nWith all that though, I played a lot of this game and had fun learning the mechanincs while playing.  The game is pretty and the game word is huge. Also reminded me of the Heros of might and magic overworld when I was microing my scout. With some balance patches I think the game will make more sense and be significantly more playable. Be prepared to learn NOT to always produce as much as possible before you flood the market and crush your profit margin. It's counter intuitive at first, but you learn to pay attention to what you need to and it becomes much clearer.\n\nno crashes so far and alt-tabbing works: stable!","September 25, 2015","true","28.0"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","8","16","0","0"

The combat side of gameplay is very hands-off.\n\nThe game currently does feel very difficult keeping your bank balance in the plus however like Port Royal 3 (another game developed by Kalypso and also one of my favorite games), once you learn how to play the game and the tricks that help you win it is very fun and challenging to play.\n\nIf you are concerned about the price or are unsure about the genre I would recommend picking up a copy of Port Royale 3 which is essentially a naval based version of Grand Ages Medieval.\n\nMost negative reviews are due to people not understanding the genre and were expecting another Total War variant or feel the game is broken (don't understand the economic mechanics). The game is fine but does require patience while you learn.\n\nI highly recommend the game however do your research first and make sure this game is for you.","September 26, 2015","true","8.2"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","5","10","0","0"

It is almost strictly a trading game, not at all comparable to Civ5.  Its comparable to Kalypso medias Port Royal 3: Pirates, only there’s no combat like there was in that game.  I like the concept of growing from a small village to a major force, BUT…\n\nHere’s a hint why some people are frustrated.  If you look at the slides advertising the game it show armies, vast “terrifying” armies and fleets (“armadas”).  I played enough to take over France and Spain and I could barely afford a single squad let alone an army.  That’s it.  Forget the military option, you can never afford it.  I made a couple of squads and they went to fight some bears.  You can watch the weeks tick by on a timer on the screen.  I estimate that these two squads (my entire army) fought those bears for two months before they won.  The only option I had was to run away.   No control over the squads.   If you’re going to advertise armies make it an integral part of the game.  Don’t lie.\n\nDiplomacy is essentially trading with a neighboring town, then paying them off.  Since you rarely have any money, it takes a long time.\n\nGraphics are nice; it’s got a great zoom feature on the little hamlets.  They probably spent a little too much time on this and not enough on the mechanics.  By the way, I see a number of people are having problems with Nvidia graphic cards.  Beware.  I have an ATI card and have not run across any bugs or crashes so it is solid from that angle.\n\nPeople play the game for 4 hours and say it’s great.  It is fun for 3 or 4 hours.  Unfortunately, shortly after that they realize that’s it.  It just continues on this repetitive grind of trading.\n\nI don’t think it would take a lot to fix the game, increase the income, lower the military costs, diplomacy hmmm … got some work to do there, but hey that’s what troops are for.\n","September 26, 2015","false","58.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I click anywhere and I seem to be setting off some different ui piece and navigating to the menus you want is hard and annoying as you often have to open windows and then sub-windows. The menus navigate better using the keyboard.......\n\nThe game itself I think could be quite fun, it could perhaps use some tweaking to make it harder or give harder options.

So heed not those reviews.\n\nGrand Ages: Medieval. A very great and difficult strategy game. And also, very underrated. Allow me to give my full review.\n\nVisuals\nThe visuals in this game are outstanding. The graphics on highest settings are simply beautiful, especially when you zoom in. Not only that, but seamless. You can zoom from a view of much of europe, to zooming in just above tree level, and it all feels completely seamless. Zooming from sky view right above your largest bustling city invlolved nearly NO lag whatsoever. It is also nice to zoom into one of your cities, and see each and every building you built there on the map, with civilians working the fields, or chopping trees, etc. All in all, the visuals are stunning.\n\nInterface\nNot too much to say here, other than the fact that the UI is very acessible and easy to use. I was able to navigate it easily from just minutes in, so I believe the UI was done very well.\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay is mainly in three phases.\n\nThe first phase is early game, which consists of heavy trade micro management. In this phase you settle the odd city, build roads and explore. But the biggest part is trade. However, as you only have one merchant, you will find yourself personally sending him city to city, buying items for cheap and selling eslewhere for more where it is needed. Military expansionism is nonexistant as your army is a token force mainly used, if anything, to raid merchants or bandits.\n\nThe second phase is mid game. By now, you are continuing to expand your empire, by number of cities. You will have larger numbers of merchants, so you will have them set up on automatic routes, trying to get a good spread of resources throughout your kingdom. Now, you will notice AI expansionsim too, and will find yourself waving your fist at red because he keeps settling north Italy, your rightful land (grumbles). Your military will start to play a significant role in fighting larger numbers of bandits, and perhaps seizing the odd city state.\n\nLate game is obviously the third and final phase. Now it is a competition to be the Emperor of Europe. Militaries will get quite big and VERY large battles and long drawn out sieges will occur. Trade is important here, but it will not consume 50+% of your time anymore. This is where the game gets very intense, and it becomes a game of diplomacy and war.\n\n\n\nAll in all, this game is great. If you are looking for a Total War remake on a world map, or a Grand Ages: Rome-like city builder, look elsewhere. This game is very unique and there is really nothing like it on the market. It is, however, a thinking mans game, so if you want something mindless and easy, do not buy this.\n\nHowever, past all that, this is a great game, and I reccomend picking it up. I believe it is well worth full price for the fun you will get out of it. Now, without further ado, here are the pros and cons.\n\nPros\n-Beautiful soundtrack\n-Stunning visuals\n-Very challenging gameplay, hard to learn, harder to master\n-Very simple diplomacy system, yet it serves its purpose perfectly\n-Early game trading is very entertaining\n-Late game conquest and large scale trade is even MORE fun\n-Game requires you to think and punishes you for making stupid decisions\n-Overall fun gameplay\n-Good AI\n\nCons\n-Combat is a bit barebones, yet it serves its purpose very well (Perhaps not a con, but a neutral?)\n-Economy can be a bit TOO hard to manage sometimes...\n-Running out of money is essentially a death sentence. It will send you spiralling to doom\n-Campaign is somewhat boring, and does not restrict the player enough, as well as not guiding you well (no completion rewards causes you to go bankrupt easily... in a tutorial)","September 26, 2015","true","7.8"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","48","11","23","2","0"

There seems to be a stream of "its not Banished" and "its not Total War" stuff being thrown around on these reviews.  While I like both of those series, I was looking for an easy to use commerce simulator only.  I actually liked that the combat was minimized and uninvolved.  Unfortunately, the whole game ranges from too much management to too little, depending on the scenario and what resources you are looking at.  There are some bugs, which I'm sure will be fixed, but honestly I think the game UI and experience just isn't smooth.

Still you give it a shot, and for all it's ambiance-all you get is a massive headache because no matter how you play, how much gold you start with, nothing you do will prevent your economy from running negative--effectively ending the game (as you can't do much with a negative economy). So basically, if there is a point to playing this game, it's simply this: how long can you last before you end up w/ a negative economy!\n\nNow, to be totally fair; yes, there are people out there who like playing "doomed to failure" type games b/c they get some kind of thrill from the "challenge!" Me: not so much. I would compair such a "challenge" to someone running at full speed and ramming their head into a brick wall. An actual challenge would be if there was a chance or a way to make it through the brick wall and get to the other side. But seeing how many times you can hit the brick wall in such a fassion before ending up at the hospital from a massive concussion is no challenge, and it's no game. Cassino's actually have better odds of winning, simply because there's actually an element of chance that can turn in your favor allowing a win.\n\n:(","April 28","false","9.6"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

However, I can't recommend it.\nHere are the two main reasons why (purely subjective)\n\n1) The game's crashed on me twice in two hours. Obviously there will always be game day release bugs, but Kalypso doesn't get a pass, because it's not an Indie company with a tiny budget, where they couldn't have had a decent Beta test. On top of that being CA$44 and, having issues with my nVidia graphics card (as it doesn't detect it. I'm not the only one,) Kalypso is a fairly large company, issues like these should have been caught before release.\n\n2) This game might as well be called Patrician V: Medieval, and not Grand Ages: Medieval.\n\nWhile I did see screenshots, and play videos, I was still hoping it would be a successor to "Grand Ages: Rome", at least in SOME way. It has absolutely nothing in common with it. In my opinion, they should have chosen a different name. Grand Ages: Rome was a fantastic, and unique game. This game, however, is basically just another iteration of the Patrician series. The only real difference is that instead of buying keys, and towns, you can found your own.\n\nI like Kalypso, and its unique games, but if you're wondering whether to buy it, I'd wait for a 50% off sale. By then the bugs will be fixed.

It is a economic simulator more than a strategy game but it is simplified, so simplified i will rather sit with friends drawing cards for wood, clay, sheep, and rock while using my gold, books or rolls of wool to upgrade my society and i find that more fun.\n\nThe game looks promising, but the fact that it has allready shown that you will need DLC's to unlock more of the game when it is brand new is rather bad, i want a game where a DLC is an addition to the game, not a part to complete it with. Otherwise, for you that are like me and loved Grand Ages : Rome, DO NOT and i repeat DO NOT buy this game if you like the Grand Ages Series, This game spits on the Grand Ages, as it is nothing like the previous one. Partly because it is not the same developer, only same publisher. I did see trailers to it, gameplay videos and similar so i knew that it wasnt like the other one, yet when i tried it i felt so locked down. I could not really do much, i was stuck with these allready formed villages that i did not really decide how they would look like in the end. So to summarize i will add some pros and cons to the game.\n\nPros:\n-The graphic is decent enough, may look bad next to all big games for 2015 but for its genre it is rather good next to the size of the maps in the game.\n-The Trading system is easy to use, either automatic or by your control\n-The diplomacy towards the AI is decent enough, simple but okay.\n-The random events are rather fun, even though historically there would not be volcanoes spawning around Scandinavia (That's where i started) in the medieval times.\n-The upgrades are well thought off and simple\n-Animations are decent enough\n-I like how you can fasttrack or put everthing on pause or superslow, that is good.\n\nCons\n-The AI's seems rather plain, like there is no real difference between the ones in the game, none of them speak different languages during a game, i dont want the entire Europe speak English, i allready got that in movies. To be hones they kinda reminded me of Skyrim's voiceactors, only two voice actors that do most of the voices in a entire game\n- Things are too simplified, even at the highest settings (pro) so it feels rather simple for a strategygame'\n-You can't really design what you build.\n-No strategy in the army system, like in the Grand Ages : Rome you got special attacks and such for the units, right now it was just big army vs other big army = biggest army wins.\n-Not remotely close to Grand Ages: Rome\n-The system of only getting upgrades by increasing in rank is rather boring for a RTS, that would work better for online play then single player.\n-Gets boring quick as you learn the game fast without any real struggle unless you don't understand english.\n-All armies look the same, except colour and coat of arms.\n-Seriously, when did every medieval city look exactly the same? Not everyone had the castle in the middle of the city, some had them outside on hills overlooking the city.\n-Again, it is not like Grand Ages: Rome and i don't think it should call itself Grand Ages: Medieval, as using a series name without looking similar to it is just bad. I think it could rather just call it Medieval and i would like it better.\n-It lacks real depth\n-The Tradesystem is so simple that you try to just get like one more coin than what you got earlier for the same trade to attempt to make some coins.\n-Seems to be dependent on having a DLC, which is bad as a game should be strong enough on its own, a DLC should not be a part of what makes a game complete.\n-Seems to much of a mini game\n\nTL;DR If you want a simple minigame that is more suited for a mobilephone, get it. If you want a proper RTS game that challenges you, go somewhere else.\n","September 26, 2015","false","0.6"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

This is not the case in this game. In this game you mirco manage trade for the sake of it. For an RTS it is currently very light on strategy and very very repetative. The depth of the combat and diplomacy are truely insulting for a full price title.\n\nThe developer did not help itself by appearing to willfully misrepresent the game in its videos and scrren shots on Steam in the weeks before its release.\n\nBut to thier credit the developers are trying to fix some of the problems with the game but I fear that will be a long hard task to get this game from where it is,  a trading/depot development game to the epic empire builder that most people expected.\n\nIt has some of the tools to get there but as seems fairly common in the past few years of game development, the community has a fair better idea, and many great ideas for how to make a game work properly.\n\nAs proved by Total War Rome II and Civ 5 people have very high standards when it comes to RTS games, especially when their expectations are not met.

However, I can't recommend it.\nHere are the two main reasons why (purely subjective)\n\n1) The game's crashed on me twice in two hours. Obviously there will always be game day release bugs, but Kalypso doesn't get a pass, because it's not an Indie company with a tiny budget, where they couldn't have had a decent Beta test. On top of that being CA$44 and, having issues with my nVidia graphics card (as it doesn't detect it. I'm not the only one,) Kalypso is a fairly large company, issues like these should have been caught before release.\n\n2) This game might as well be called Patrician V: Medieval, and not Grand Ages: Medieval.\n\nWhile I did see screenshots, and play videos, I was still hoping it would be a successor to "Grand Ages: Rome", at least in SOME way. It has absolutely nothing in common with it. In my opinion, they should have chosen a different name. Grand Ages: Rome was a fantastic, and unique game. This game, however, is basically just another iteration of the Patrician series. The only real difference is that instead of buying keys, and towns, you can found your own.\n\nI like Kalypso, and its unique games, but if you're wondering whether to buy it, I'd wait for a 50% off sale. By then the bugs will be fixed. Or unless you're desperate to play what may as well be called "Patrician V: Medieval"","September 25, 2015","false","2.0"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NinjaBoy2/recommended/310470/","NinjaBoy2","ninjaboy2","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NinjaBoy2/","62 products in account","Ive played this game for about a day now and i do like it but there are alot of problems with it.\n\n1: the resourses are the same everywhere, i mean everywhere, just the basic things youd expect to have in every kingdomw or country around the world. There are no exotic resources like spices, ivory even gold which is a basic resource in all games trading and grand strategy. Also a city may have 10 resources avalible but you can only use 5 of them which i feel is a little poor. So if a developer does end up reading this please add more resources as it is really boring and also allow for cities to use all the resources surrounding it.\n\n2: unlike in most grand strategy/ empire building games you do get to pick where your cities go, however you dont get much choice in the way of buildings, each city can only have 5 resources utilised and even then you dont see them on the resource tiles you only see the buildings in the city which is also poor cause you would expect to see where there are trees to be a logging camp, where theres iron a mine etc. Also there arent many utility buildings avalible which is also very poor.\n\n3: trade, to call this game a game of immersive trade is plain lying. The trade system is completely flawed as you cant do much trading and to set up a manual trade route looks easy but it rarely works and is so much hassle. With 5 cities you can be manufacturing all resources avalible so there would be no need to trade with other cities.\n\n4: Diplomacy is terrible, everything requires gold to do, theres no just offering a treaty to them you have to pay gold and after a while it becomes a rediculous ammount of gold just for a trade treaty despite the fact that the city wont even be worth 1/100th of what they demand. so its utterly utterly poor.\n\n5: combat is also poor, its not bad but still not much choice in terms of units, and when attacking a city it not only takes a rediculous ammount of troops but also when attacking a city with no walls what so ever, population of just 200 and no troops in it even if yoy attack with 10,000 men you still have to wait which is stupid if a town has no walls and no defenders then you should just be able to walk in and take it not wait 50 in game weeks to take it over.\n\nThis game has the makings of a great game but its still really a game at 0.5 level, still needs soo much work done to it still needs so much put into it, this is not worth £30 , Its worth £10 cause there is very little in it and very little options to reply it as youre doing the same thing over and over and its too repetitive. Kalypso youve kinda robbeb people here with this, if you dont add more stuff in then you need to reduce the price as this is not worth what youre charging for it and you know its not.","October 30, 2015","false","1.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Once I reached this point, I kind of lost interest, as all the technologies had been researched and there was no real competition.  Don't take this as meaning this game is boring, I played for a solid 12hrs straight before this point.\n\nRegarding diplomacy; if you have enough money, you can pretty much buy anything.  You can pay other leaders, and once they like you enough, you can simply buy their towns from them.  If this sounds too easy, then you can build up armies...\n\nArmies: They are expensive as ♥♥♥♥ to maintain, and the lower level units give better stats per upkeep than the higher level units.  It's pretty strange.  What makes it even stranger, is that you'll spend most of your time using your armies to fight wild animals (who take a fair bit longer to kill than bandits....strange; it's like the molerats and radroaches in Fallout: Shelter).  Additionally, the inability to fully destroy the structures containing wild animals led to me having to build a fort next to them, and keep rotating in fresh, healthy troops into it, just to fend off wild animals. You can create forts, but they can only stock one unit at once, which makes them only really useful for fending off a single unit attack, rather than possible enemy armies (of which I never saw one).\n\nThe combat itself is really, really, really simple.  There are barely tactics involved. It's just who can have a larger stack of units with higher combat value; with a little bit of alteration depending on which units types are better at fighting other unit types (doesn't effect it that much).  A bit of theft from the Total War book would have helped them out.  That being said, the resource management/trading side of things craps all over Total War.  And that is why this game is not a flop; and it gains my recommendation to play it.","September 29, 2015","false","11.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I eventually got a nicely balanced game going on. For me, this is a good sign; the more complex and balanced a game is then the more game play I'm going to get out of it.

People may have been mislead by this.\n- It's not for everyone. You have to be a fan of economic simulations to like it.\nEven Wikipedia lists it as "City building, Real-Time strategy"... which is not totally wrong,\nbut pretty misleading. It's an *economic simulation*. With a little city building, and a little warfare\nmixed in.\n- I would have liked it more if you could actually choose locations for buildings in your cities. You can't.\n\nThe :|\n- The map is pretty big. However, cities take up much more space than in real life. So you can't build as much cities as are\nin Europe, but you can build a whole bunch, I guess around 100.\n- The user interface could be more intuitive at times - but I got used to it fast.\n- The sound and graphics are not outstanding. Though it is cool that you can zoom in and out from\na view of Europe to a view of a single city. Unfortunately the zoom is not as seamless as it could be\n(There are 4 zoom levels - hard to explain, watch a video to see it).\n- The story seems mediocre (so far), but the illustrations and voice overs are nice. The animated models are not great though.\n- I have not tested the multiplayer mode yet. I think it could be fun, but I haven't tried it, so I cannot comment.\n- I don't know how it plays if you have half of Europe "conquered", because I only have about 12 cities now.\n\nThe :)\n- I have always wanted a game, where you have different places(cities), that produce different goods\nand have to exchange those goods. There are several games that are similar in this regard - like\nAnno or even MiniMetro, Factorio, or SimuTrans. (I have to say at this point, that when I first saw GAM,\nI thought "Civilization", but Civ does not focus on trade.)\nHowever GAM also makes use of the principle of supply and demand.\nSo you can't just build huge amounts of one particular (expensive) good, and sell it all the time.\nIf you produce too much, the prices will fall and your production costs will exceed your income.\n- You have to define trade routes between your (and others') cities. You can limit these to certain goods / amounts, or\njust let them "buy cheep, sell expensive" which works good in most cases.\n- Armies play a minor role. For me, this is a plus. I have spent hours defeating a bandit camp (of 200 guys)\nbecause I just couldn't pay enough soldiers. Whenever I defeated a bunch of bandits, I ran out of money.\nThen the soldiers just wont fight any more - they go back to the next city and wait until you have money again.\nAnd those damn bandits regenerate pretty fast.\nIt was all my fault. I had to build this one city next to a bandit camp.\nThe thing is: I could have survived without much fighting, and I like that in this kind of game. I like\nthe fact that you cannot just buy a huge army and overrun everyone.\nThat could be fun, but there are already enough games that do that, and it just doesn't fit into this simulation\nkind of game.\n\nTechnical stuff:\n- I just found one weird bug: It keeps telling me that this savegame was played by someone else, so I cannot unlock\nachievements. That's not good, but I don't care too much for achievements, so I'm fine. Also, I read in the changelog\nthat they fixed this bug, but only for new savegames. As far as I understand it, it shouldn't effect you, if you haven't\nplayed yet.\n- There have been two patches in the first week. They apparently fixed a lot of bugs, but I didn't run into any of those.\n- There's this Kalypso installer thing which starts every time you start the game. You can register an account there.\nIt's a little annoying, but it's only two clicks to skip it, so I don't mind it.\n- I heard this game will be released for consoles. I would strongly recommend it playing with a mouse!\n\nOverall, I can say that I have played 15 hours of this game, and I still want to continue.\nIf you are into those kinds of games, you should definitively check it out, watch an hour of a Let's Play -\nand then decide. It definitively does not deserve the "mixed" reviews that it gets on steam.\n","October 3, 2015","true","30.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

There are real annoyances like almost unkillable bandit dens and similar for some wild animals, but they don't overwhelm. I have played games like Patrician from the same company and this does have resemblances in the trade engine. The ai opponents are capable and hopefully they are not cheating. I for one am happy I got this game. It adds to the 4x genre. It still needs some fine tuning, but the developers have been efficient in release patches that deal with annoyances.

I started with the campaign which acts as a tutorial of sorts as well as I'm not one to just jump into a game and then blame the game for not being enjoyable simply because I didn't take the time to get a handle on the basics.\n\nSo,  I'm giving this a 6/10 soley due to the fact that despite it's shortcomings, Grand Ages Medieval managed to keep me engrossed. There are echoes of other RTS and trading style games here, like the early Anno games for example, but you get no say in layout of your cities - the AI does a lot of things for you in that regard. I can appreciate that on the scale of the map, you may well want some help managing things, but at times this isn't always executed well.\n\nI do see potential here if the developer continues to enhance the game. Frankly, I feel like I'm playing an open beta that lacks the finer details and polish that a finished game should have. While I've encountered no game breaking bugs, there is just a fundamental lack of depth to unit rosters, diplomacy and warfare. The one thing that I cannot forgive at this stage is the LACK OF SIEGE ENGINE units in a game set during the Middle Ages that requires so much sieging to be done. Seriously, what were the devs thinking???\n\nTo sum up, based on my observations and experience during game play thus far:\n\nPros:\n\n- Big map, nicely rendered IMO\n- Stable with no bugs that I've found to date\n\nCons:\n\n- Can get a bit repetitive - the addtion of random in-game events might help this - the only missions from towns are "get me some of this and I'll like you more" - needs more variety.\n- Battle mechanics are annoying and overwhelming force doesn't always mean quick victory.\n- Sieges favour defenders given there's no siege equipment in the game and sieging forces are easily distracted by small enemy untits. There is also a limit to how many units can siege.\n-  Ruins / Caves - keep away from them and don't build roads near them. Impossible to clear out permantly and when attacked spawn large numbers of wild animals instantly.\n\nMeh:\n\n- Unit veterancy is gained in battle, lost with replacement of casualties but would be nice for immersion's sake if your units could gain some permanent perks for length of service, battles fought.\n- The late game empires that  seem to form are difficult to overcome given the way battle and siege mechanics work. Micromanagement becomes a chore at a certain point.\n- Unit cap based on your ruler's rank - not size of your empire.

Right now at the launch i could not recommend this game to anyone.\n\nEdit: Did i mention that the pre-order price was 38 euros which was supposed to be -15% off, but the launch price is 36.99?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ringhloth/recommended/310470/","ringhloth","ringhloth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ringhloth/","351 products in account","The game essentially attempts to be a Patrician 4 or Rise of Venice across all of Europe, with combat mechanics and more focused on ruling than trading. I found Patrician 4 and Rise of Venice both to be okay games, and while I expected it to fall short of them because of its lofty ambitions, I'm surprised by how much it was.\n\nBy the way, before I go in depth, let me preface with this: in the open gameplay, there is no Constantinople. It doesn't exist. What the campaign centers around is completely missing in the open gameplay. There are many other settlements, like Venice and Genoa, which are really conspicuous in their absence.\n\nTrading:\n\nThe trading is significantly worse than in Rise of Venice or Patrician 4. Even though there are possible more cities, they're on a much, much larger scale, and you'll usually only find communities of 3 or 4 cities that would trade with each other. Also, each city is limited to one trader. In order to compensate, the consumption that cities do is drastically lowered, to the extent that it's really only super profitable to deliver goods to facilities that consume them. Not only that, but because each settlement can freely choose what it produces, production is actually less interesting. Resources become really common, and instead of a well balanced, hand-crafted system, you have just a jumble of weird production.\n\nCombat:\n\nCombat lasts a ridiculous amount of time. It's silly how long it does. It can take 6-7 weeks. Early combat, where your scout is attacked by bandits, is the most boring thing to watch, because on a scale where the weakest true military unit has 100 strength, scouts have 2, and bandits have 1, so they'll almost never do any meaningful damage to each other, and it takes months for anything to happen. It's also absurdly expensive, where trading isn't profitable enough to really make any difference.\n\nRuling:\n\nRuling is boring, and poorly done. You make barely any money from doing it, and the trading system is tied to it to poor effects. Constructing new buildings isn't interesting, taxes aren't useful, building new cities is essetially what caused this game to be as bad as it is through the vast amounts of open territory, and the tech system just feels like the game hiding things from me for no reason, such as telling my traders what they should trade on trade routes. That's a basic feature of automated trade routes. Why is it locked behind tech? The upgrades to military should cost significantly less upkeep than they do now, but instead be marginally better. Rather than tier three costing 5x as much but being 3x as effective, it should be 1.5-2x as effective but cost 1.25x as much. After all, you've already sunk very valuable tech points into them, and they're unique units for the place you started. They should be outright better.\n\nOverall, they game tried to be something that it wasn't, and failed at being both what it wasn't and what it was. This happens all the time in the game industry, and it always ends badly.","September 25, 2015","false","7.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It seems as if it's hard in the beginning, but once you understand the supply/demand principles, it's pretty easy to sit on a cash pool of millions regenerating weekly.\n\nFor the rest of the game, it's not very exciting, because I'm very much missing any kind of serious battle system, which is sad. All you do is build a few defence towers against bandits/wolves/bears, put in a troup of archers which you send to tavern from time to time to restock, that's it about your terretory, even your war opponents won't attack you. If you want to attack, it's pretty simple: Get one taller squad of a good mixed troup (ranged/blunt/sharp/pike) and basically just win. I get along pretty easy with ~10 of those troups, and if one dies, I just build one up in the next barracks and send it into battle - that's no problem as long as the battles last.\n\nThe basically not-so-easy econmy system as in a lot of other war-centric RTS games mixed with a more complex war and fighting system would be REAL fun. I'm really missing that part.\n\nAlso, I'm very much missing a lot of diplomacy options as you have in other games, as in example expanding your terretory through marriage. There, a lot of the Turn-Based titles make a much better job.\n\nIt has had more potential than what it's now. But the game overall is fun and I still like to play it (a lot). If you know what you get and you like that kind of game, go for it. If you like epic battles - don't go for it.","September 30, 2015","true","53.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

Just completed my first full playthrough of this game, and I liked it. The map is huge. I mean really really big. Really. Best as I thought I had a good corner of the world sliced out for myself, a few alliances quickly revealed to me exactly how vast the world I played in was, and how little of it I in reality controlled.\n\nBut, and there is a but. The game has some shortcomings.\n\nIt is built around a simplified trade and millitary system, without much progression. You unlock a few specialised units as you advance (locked to regions; e.g. Longbowmen in Great Britain etc) - but the trade/commerce system never changes from the start until the end. There are no regional supplies, basically only some very basic consumption type goods for food, a few "component" type commerce items (like wool for cloth, grain for beer) and a few "business items" (finished products, like clothes, jewellry, tools) - and that's it. So you basically end up having 100 cities or more, all producing the very same goods, and moving them around in a simplified "balance all" traderoute system. This works ok in the beginning, when you have less than 10 cities and choosing what each city builds and distributes actually makes sense - later on there is no point whatsoever, and the whole idea of setting up and min-maxing your traderoutes is just pointless. You don't care what they build; you just add production facitilites to cities for them to grow.\n\nBut all things said, I did enjoy the game. I just feel it falls slightly short for much replay value. Also; I conquered the world, but didn't get to grandstand in a massive throneroom being worshipped by the world. What's up with that?   Game just carried on, like a sandbox that never ran out of sand.\n","October 5, 2015","true","21.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It would be nice if there was some character building. The opportunity to select a trait (ie. diplomacy bonus, cheaper soldier upkeep, increased production, ect.) every time a promotion is earned could go a long way to flesh out the rulers.

The economy system is not straight forward and can be rather difficult to manage. The game had a pre order DLC which is becoming the sad reality with a lot of games today and illuminates the fact that games are just sources of income for developers like this. I dont mind paying for a game, but this game with the DLC included is not worth $40.\nMy next complaint is very nit-picky, but I feel like there are those who will agree with me. Two units of swordsmen had trouble with wolves... Not to mention that their battle with these wolves started in winter and ended in summer.

If you enjoy Patrician, chances are you might like this game. If you expect, and want, exciting, engaging, and awesome tactical combat... you won't get any... at all.\n\nIt is all about trade routes and founding cities in sensible locations. Figuring out how to manage the trade routes to return a solid profit may take a while, but the economy can be balanced. Expect to restart the campaign a few times to get it right. Take your time, don't rush through the objectives. Producing too many goods can be tempting, but will eventually collapse your trade-routes and your economy. You can produce up to five different supplies at each town - and deciding what to produce where - is important to your trade route and economy. There is simple diplomacy. You barter for transit agreements, trade agreements, peace, alliance, war and so on.\n\nAnd, for this part I recommend the game for those that enjoy a pure economy sim. But, only if you can suffer the frustrations below:\n\nYou will need a Kalypso account (I'm so tired of signing in with every single developers useless "social" platform).\n\nYou have little to no control over what your armies do. When engaged in combat, your only tactical move is flee. You compose your armies of units with strengths and weaknesses and pit them against enemy cities or units. You are a passive observer to combat, watching a siege that might take years, or a combat between 12 men lasting a month or two (ingame time). You discover a monster den here and there that seemingly cannot be destroyed. Packs of 70+ wolves, lynxes, and what not, will harass your traders. Bandits will spawn camps so big defeating them has a good chance of ruining your "empire". I have not tried multiplayer, and I won't.\n\nAll in all the good outweighs the bad to a small degree for my part.

The premise is similar to Civilization (and most other empire building games): you start with one small town, build the economy, settlers, armies, then spam cities across the map till you bury your opponents under the weight of your empire.\n\nHowever, the gameplay is very different from most other games of this type. First, there is much less warfare. The barbarians are relatively passive, and do not constantly attack your cities. Also, armies are expensive, so you fight fewer wars with fewer units.\n\nThe biggest difference in Grand Ages compared to most empire games is the economic model. Grand Ages is primarily a trading game. There are 20 commodities you cities need, but  each city can only make 5, So trading is required. A large interlocking trade network is key to success. However most of your trading can be automated, so you don't constantly have to keep track of dozens of units like you do in many empire builders.\n\nI said I like this game the longer I play, because the economic system is so very different from other empire building games  and takes time to learn. In some games, once you get a few key technologies, your cities will earn obscene amounts of money. But in Grand Ages, the cost of production comes very close to equaling your income from sales. So building more factories to produce more goods is not always a good policy. You must balance production against demand. If you produce more than you can sell, prices will fall,  your production costs will be greater than your sales, and you quickly go bankrupt.  It takes practice to learn to only build businesses which have enough demand to support them. (I recommend watching some Utube videos dedicated to explaining the economy to help understand how this works.) One huge annoyance is that some of the most important charts on managing your economy and trade routes are buried under layers of screens. Read the forum and watch some videos to find these key charts.\n\nWhile they are great games, Civ, EU, and Total War have been around for decades, and I find the game play getting really stale. Grand Ages Medieval introduces what I find to be a fresh approach to empire building.\n\nMy main gripes are with the poorly organized economic charts, and the very poorly optimized campaign game. I thought the campaign was supposed to introduce you to good gaming practices, but I learned more about  game play watching 30 minutes on Utube than in several hours of playing the campaign. The campaign progresses at a snails pace, and did more to hinder my understanding than help. I had to restart several times because my economy kept collapsing when I tried to followed the advice of the narrator.\n\nI would rate this game 8/10, and worth the price compared to similar games.","September 30, 2015","true","62.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Found your own cities, and expand your empire through either peaceful negotiation, military means, or creating settlers.  Each city location has access to strategic resources, and it is up to you to decide what is produced in each city, based on those resources.\n\nEach city can manufacture up to 5 resources (out of 20), which are either consumed by your citizens, or used as trade with other cities.  Whilst trading is a big part of the game, it is more important that your citiznes in each city have access to a wide range of products to ensure prosperity.  Provide your cities with the goods they need, and your empire will flourish.  Fail to do this, and watch your empire crumble.\n\nThe balancing act here is to ensure your cities produce a wide range of goods, and then establishing trade routes to pass goods through central hubs to ensure each city has a wide range of products available, and balancing production to ensure you have enough to meet demand, without creating excessive supply which can lead to financial hardships on higher difficulties.\n\nThe campaign acts as a basic tutorial, and while it explains some game concepts very well, it completely ignores other key aspects of the game, and if you try to follow the story to the letter, it will probably lead to bankruptcy and frustration.  It took a couple of re-starts for me to finish the campaign, realizing what i did wrong and going back and doing things different to get through.\n\nThe tech tree appears pretty basic, but depending on what your towns can produce, will depend on what order you unlock things.  Quite often, a manufacturing shortage can be solved by investing in a research that increases production, saving alot of money and resources building new manufacturing sites.  Also, depending on your starting region, will determine how your military progresses, as regions have basic units they can all produce, as well as units specific to different regions.\n\nThe game also gives you a choice on what level you would like to micro manage your empire.. You can manually set your own trade routes, detailing exactly how much to buy and sell in each city on the route, or select auto to have the AI run it for you..  Whilst I am sure the AI does not run 100% efficiently, it does a pretty decent job of ensuring cities have what they need, as long as your hub has the resources to supply.\n\nOverall I have really enjoyed the game.. I find it quite challenging to keep abreast of eveything, and finding the right balance is key.. Building 2 new sites in 1 city, could cause shortages of other goods in your empire, as the population growth leads to more demand for all goods..  It can be difficult to get into, but once you 'get it' I find it to be a fun game, and the devs have so far shown they listen to the community and respond, and are here to make the game better.","October 6, 2015","true","14.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

This is not a military game, it is an economics game. It does that very well in my opinion. It does have a hell of a learning curve, which most people whine about these days when death comes in negitive numbers, not in battles lost. Having a military is extremely costly, that is truely to deter anyone from trying to turn it into a military rush game. THIS ISN'T A TOTAL WAR GAME, and it has nothing to do with the earlier grand ages rome. If you wanted combat, go else where. the combat model in this game is set up so that you dont have to pay attention to combat, troops are very fire and forget, and no amount of tactics will save an inferior army. The bandits are a little over powered for my tastes, given the massive military costs, but thats it for military complaints.\nAs towards peoples failures, this game was set up to be like the middle ages, in the middle ages NOT EVERYONE SUCCEDED. The best players of this game will still lose because of a random plague at the beginning or something of that nature.\nthere are parts of this game that are not intuitive, but anyone who has taken a college economics course will tell you that economics rarely is. And as i said before, this game is true to the economics of the time. Can you have a max size city? Yes, larger is always possible, but you have to be a master at logistics, and almost no one is.\n\nTLDR: This game is fun, but has a harsh learning curve, and is about realistic economics, not warfare.","September 26, 2015","true","45.4"," 9 of 21 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","9","21","0","0"

The game is very obtruse, is nothing like EU4 or Civ 5, and is mainly a trading game (which is fine).  However, due to the trading system in the game, there is a very large learning curve, and since the game is centered around trading, you'll most likely find yourself scratching your head for a few hours before shelving it, the game has *much* potential in the future, but in it's current state I cannot recommend this game and requested a refund, I do have 4 hours played so I might not get that refund, but we'll see.","September 26, 2015","false","4.8"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

I should say first that i didn't play it a long time so i probably pass through good points, but here is what i feel about it:\nThe map is big, and doesn't seem to lag on my computer. So it's a good point.\nThe economic system seems to work well, but it's hard (at less for me) and that's a good point too.\nYou can't place buildings where you want or design castle like you want like in a Stronghold, it's more you choose the type of building like in a Total War, and the ai place it where it can. But i believe with the number of cities you can create/conquer and so manage, it may be necessary to do so.\nThe Battles. I believe it's due to the system (real time on a big map) but, even with the rock paper scissor system with the types of units, battles look like big melees, i hardly manage something, you don't have any siege engine, you make the siege of a city with a timer to get it, it's less good than a Stronghold battle, and so far away of a Total War battle feeling.\nI don't regret to get this game, because i was waiting for it, but if you ask me because you are not sure, i don't recommend it. :/\n","September 26, 2015","false","9.6"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

It is first and foremost an economic simulator with war and diplomancy thrown in for good measure.\n\nYou take the role of a small city cheifton and from there you manage your village into a city that trades with other towns/cities in the region. You expand your influence by settling more cities as your hometown grows. You have to be able to micromange your economy to be successful in this game, it is not a  build a base to destroy your enemies game. What it does accomplish very well is its level of detail and replayablity based on what region of the world you play in. As you explore there are different events that can help or hinder your fiefdom. Natural disasters, bandits and wild animals hinder your trade and kill your people. So maintaining a balance of defense and economic prosperity is absolutely crucial to your success.\n\nMy only real compliant with this game and this can be easily fixed, is the map can be to large when playing the whole of Europe. you can literally go hours without seeing an other opponent. The game stops you from adding no more than 8 opponents on a giant map and adapts if you chose to regionalize, which is fine for most players, but if your looking for a small arena map with alot of opponetns, than this is going to dissapoint.\n\nThe learning curve for Grand Ages is about 1-2 hours in my expereince learning how to trade properly can be fustrating but really rewarding if you take the time to read the prompts and consider the laws of supply and demand.\n\nOverall the game is pretty solid as it is more of a economic simulation that compares to Europa: Universials or Crusader Kings.","September 25, 2015","true","13.5"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","17","1","6","0","0"

But once you spend a few hours learning the mechanics, you will be on your way to understanding just how to stabilise trade and take out bandits and hostile invaders, including many wild animals disrupting your peaceful settlements.\n\nIt is rather satisfying knowing that you or any other faction cannot steamroll their way through the game. Soon you will be able to conquer neutral or enemy settlements and explore the stunning map.\n\nCriticism >\nThe game does require a few economic and military tweeks.

I am kinda surprised that people are surprised by the way this game is developing. I have enjoyed GAR, Tropico 5 and Imperium Romanum and I am happy to add this one to my library.\n\nThey have fixed the main issues that impacted me playing in the meantime and that deserves some credit. Having said that, the economy does need some tweaking to make it work better here and there . The tutorial/ campaign could stand to be more explicit in the hows and whys of economy building during the campaign if there isnt going to be more of a tutorial separate from the campaign.\nLearning how to build profitable trade routes are a challenge to figure out but not impossible. There is a lot of good stuff in there.\n- During the campaign, it seems no one wants to offer a trade alliance without a significant impact to your cash reserves a bit too early.\n- Focus on building traders and carts according to trade capacity on each route and only get additional traders seemed to help me but for a game that is trade intense, there should be more about how to set the trade routes up effectively in the campaign.\n\nVideo graphics are right on target for me and I really enjoy being able to still go in close and see the people doing different tasks. I also enjoy the seasons changing. Overall in this area I am happy with it. I enjoy the voice overs and would encourage you to do the same with the mission pop up dialogues during the campaign to further enhance the player experience.\n\nBottom line, I like what they have done so far and I look forwars to seeing more. I am glad you won't be microcharging for additional content. I think the approach for future plans for a big expansion like tropico had are on target and look forward to playing more multiplayer too. :P Don't let the mixed reviews fool you, if you appreciate RTS and city building, you should add this to your library.","September 26, 2015","true","41.2"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","4","0","0"

Managing all the goods is fairly easy as soon as you understand the system and get a cycle of 4 cities together. But until you reach that point you have a very very annoying meantime, where your towns are still developing and growing.\nThe combat has a weird feeling to me aswell... the circle is fullbut my troops are still in combat for ages... yes i know it means that my troops are outmanning the enemy by far, yet the fight seems to be endless\n\nNegotiating with NPC mayors doesn't have a loot of benefit to me anymore. They don't send traders themselves it seems and i have to build my own buildings around their productions, so it's just easier for me to run over them with my army real quick and re-build the town from scratch.\nWith the NPC players i didn't have to much contact yet.. just found the first one of them and yea...when i look at the scoreboard i am like "♥♥♥♥ this guy, i dont need to trade with him"\nAnd why don't i need to trade with him? because i have all goods for myself already. That's a big issue i think, because it makes trade agreements really unnecessary. the only thing that differs from each nation is just the one empowered troop you can train there. So what i am missing are important ressources like in Civ V, that you just dont have like almost everywhere per default. I want to get something out of trade agreements, like importing goods that i just don't have in my own lands.\nBut this is just not the case, because there are no such important ressources and every 4 town cycle has all the needed goods almost guaranteed, if you used your brain while founding a new one.  Also this system doesn't really allow me to just go for one good that i want to produce, like make one town a freaking wepaon factory and sell those into the entire continent, while i import food and lumber from NPCs/players around me\n\nAnyways, as i said: I don't know why i like this game. You can see i only pointed out flaws, but yet i still play the game every day for a few hours.","September 29, 2015","true","32.8"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","14","1","7","0","0"

You buy and sell hoping to turn a profit somehow but in the time I spent with it not even my automated ai-controlled merchant could turn a profit.\n\nThe combat is what I was looking forward to the most. I had thought that I'd get a nice economy going then conquer my enemies with pikes and bows but even that was a let down.\n\nYou simply send your unit to attack the enemy unit and have no influence over the "battle" at all.\n\nTo put it simply, sitting there tweaking a production & trade menu for hours on end just isn't my thing.","September 25, 2015","false","3.2"," 3 of 13 people (23%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","23","3","13","0","1"

However, all of those aspects of the game that I'm into are completely autonomous. What I'm left with feels like a real-time version of Civilization. For some people, this may be exactly what they are looking for, but it simply doesn't have big appeal for me.\n\nA big part of the game seems to deal with trade. Ordinarily, I like trading games, but again many of the aspects that I like about trading games aren't here. I like more management in my game, while this feels a bit too casual for my tastes.\n\nFor die-hard Civ fans, I'm sure you'll love it.

Music is lovely but sound effects are sometimes jarring especially if you zoom in on any battles; the battles themselves are simplistic but good enough as this is more about trading and empire building than Total War Combat.\n\nEssentially the enjoyment comes from building new cities watching them grow and flourish or fail depending on how well you have grasped the game. You have to trade between your cities and friendly neutral towns with different resources to allow expansion and population growth until finally you reach metropolis size. Some of the features such as the warehouse I'm not sure are functioning as intended and the better you do at the game the more you are punished for it in diplomatic relations. I.E if you have 100000 coins you will have to pay 10% for a friendship bribe with a neutral city but if you have 5000000 coins its 100000 coins........so a bit a poor game mechanics there but honestly once you have the hang of trading you don't miss even a million coins which is what it costs to buy the average city once you are friendly enough with it. My first game play on campaign was also exceptionally frustating as I hadnt gotten the hang of trading and I was 250000 in the red and unable to trade and couldnt get out of bleeding money and with only the auto save I had to start the campaign again from scratch as there is no re-do chapter button or staggered saving......you have been warned ;)\n\nThe biggest problem with the game at the moment and possibly something they will hopefully rectify in the future is the lack of resources and building slots so once you have all the required resources built in a chain of cities you essential admire your work for a little while then build a settler and go do it all over again and this is not a bad thing I'm just saying once you have played it far enough into the game you will find yourself wanting more diversity. There are twenty different resources to manage so maybe they didnt want to overwhelm you at the start and getting to grips with it can leave you a little dazed and confused until you get the hang of trading.\n\nIf you want a relaxing engaging game that requires strategy and planning then this is a game for you. If you are looking to get stressed and kill stuff then go play World of Tanks.\n\nI can understand certain negative comments as the balance at the start does seem a little well unbalanced. It is very difficult in the begining i.e one mistake with your economy and you go bankrupt; you get usually one peasant with a spear to defend your city/cities and can barely afford their upkeep but in comparison when you have I can't remember how many developed cities I have now in the campaign mode I earn around 100k everytime i touch the x10 button and have swordsmen cavalry coming out of my ears with so much cash floating around I just have nothing to do with it so yeah maybe eventually they will rebalance the game.It does have a steep learning curve but stick with it as its very rewarding. The help guide has typos and errors and I often couldnt find what I was looking for but I figured it out in the end; mainly in the start its just wanting to know what resources combine with what to make whatever and that is not very clear unless you hover over the icon in a certain menu.\n\n*Update*\n\nSo having now logged over 30 hours of gameplay I am still enjoying the game and have found a few things out such as you can specify upkeep costs,troop costs, economy stability, disaster effects etc in a menu before you start a an open game but again I found this by accident rather than design and if only the developers pointed a big sign post to this menu it would wipe out half of the negative reviews right there. You know troop cost too much.......building upkeep too much etc etc. The truth is though having played it at the start I found all the complaints that everyone else has but having mastered it my little French Empire is swimming in gold.......I kept my finger on the space bar for the x10 effect, which you can set to on and off when you hit the space bar instead of holding it down.......another complaint by players and another missed sign post by the developers, and before I knew it I had 12 million coins.\n\nI wish a wall would appear around my city......hint hint development team. I do find it jarring that the game has been developed with consoles in mind as the controls are there and that is perhaps why it has a simplistic feel to it......after all P.C users are a more intelligent breed than the average button bashing console owner and probably 20 years older too.\n\nYou can also broker treaties between the different factions and it actually works which is a nice touch. Usually games are very much about the A.I ganging up on you and you battle the world but in this I felt more like the U.N which was a cool feeling for a change.\n\nThe A.I does however spread like a plague across the map and if you play it on the whole of Europe you are only allowed 7 opponents and there are erm 11 or 12 starting locations so yes you guessed it.......while you potter around building up the French Empire for example they have already expanded from Italy into the Balkans.....Spain........North Afrika.........and beyond which would easily be aleviated by allowing an oppenent in each starting location.\n\nFor the game to last and to turn around the negative reviews it needs economic diversity based on location and of course more resources to trade meaningful upgrades and a tweaked combat system.\n\nAlso I liked the whole puppet master feel you get when you are selling French Knights as was the case for me to two factions fighting on your borders and watching them slowly grind each other to dust with your mercenary troops.........their long suffering peasants naturally turned to me for salvation in the end and their empires collapsed slowly.\n\nOh and who's idea was it to have a giant beaver as a statue???? I like beaver as much as the next man but a giant beaver statue.......\n\nWould I recommend you buy this game, no.Wait until it is on sale then purchase it.\n\nDo I think it could have been a great game, yes but for now I think its just good with room for\nimprovement.\n\n*Update*\n\nSadly I'm just simply bored with it now.......even with a good imagination you can only rinse and repeat so many times and there is simply no depth or lasting appeal to it. It has been a pretty dissapointing year for game releases in general. Oh well Total War: Warhammer to look forward to until them I will go back and play Crusader Kings II which has HUGE lasting appeal and depth and has over 600+ hours logged on it. Are P.C games just getting harder to make or are playtesters just getting worse?","September 26, 2015","false","45.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After you play for 20 hours, it's over. You played through the whole game. Sure, it's easier for veterans, like me, of commerce simulators like Patrician, to play this game, but in the end after you learn how to play and what are the most important things to do, it's over. Not even like Patrician. Patrician wanted you to pinpoint manage structures. One city crumbles, other cities crumble. One city arises, others can, with your skill. But in the end? In the end here Random events do basically nothing. They are random, sure, but they come and pass and you don't even notice them.\n\nTrading: Probably the worst part.\n20 resources.\ntoo few? too many?\nPatrician III has the same amount\nSure\nBut patrician expands on merely a quarter of this game! This game could be HUGE. If only, if only a subroutine for weapons, siege weapons, more detailed production charts... Instead, you basically set up an economy, trying to make the best of your cities, and In the end you copypaste your scheme over and over in the whole europe. Corn-fruit here, Brick-Wood here, Coal-Metal-Ironwork here, and so on, over and over and over again.\nWhich is a pity because it could have been much more detailed, with many more things.\n\nBUT\nAnd there comes the WORST part\n\nIf they ever tried to do a thing like that it would have clashed with the trading system.\nOh Gosh the trading system\nManual Trading? Said no one ever. That's how you can summarise it.\nYou will NEVER, EVER do manual trade. But the worst part is the AUTO TRADE system\nthere is no way you can defend it. On one side, auto trade is everything you need. Connect 3-4 max 5 cities with the one  of spawn of your merchant. On the other, when you unlock the possibility to manually set the quantities and pricing of each thing, Suddenly you realise that it's WORTHLESS doing such, because you can't Autobuy in one city and manual sell in others. No. EITHER ALL ARE AUTO OR ALL ARE MANUAL.\nAnd MoreOver, there is no single digit customization. Pricing ranges only can go from 120% to 100% to 80%. And you are stuck without being able to actually doing a smarter trade because it's clunky.\n\nWar system is useless\nYea there are synergies between units. But ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ THERE IS NO WAY 2000 TROOPS TAKE WEEKS TO KILL 100. Not realistic, not even cured. It looks like everything is based on Percentages.\nThere are no siege weapons, either. Sieges are all a matter of how can pull the most troops around the city and keep them there. From the closest city. Regardless of the content of the city but only if the city is prospering or not.\nMore, there is no use of having lots of troops. You will NEVER overwhelm the opponent. You will have to wait patiently that the percentages work and SLOWLY kill the enemy units. completely Nonsense.\n\nIn the end this game need more work. More depth. You can't have 20 resources in a game which is 5-6 times larger than it's predecessors.\nI really look forward because the concepts are great, and I, regardless f what it said, really love this game.","October 2, 2015","false","46.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The more I play the more I have to dig deepter to get the trading. So, know it's a trading and empire expansion game. There is no real action. It is somewhat slow moving, time is ticking and can be sped up a bit, you get the picture. Don't buy if your're looking for something else. It has instructions that require complex thought. This is not for Total War fans. It is more like the Civ series in the battle area, with the ai conducting outcomes, but trading and city/empire expansions are way way more complex.","June 2","true","27.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I really like their concept of the trade routes and getting goods to all my cities.  The problem I see for this game is that after you've got a few cities and have obtained all the trade goods it becomes very repetative.  Build a few cities and create a trade network among them and repeat.  If it was possible to obtain more numerous and more rare trade goods to add to the network it could be more challenging and more interesting.\n\nThe military aspect of the game is very simple and unimaginative.   You build a bunch of troops and throw them at the enemy.  You have almost no conrol over your troops once in combat so battle tactics and strategy aren't much of a factor.  It quickly becomes very tedious once you go to war.\n\nIm dating myself here, but it almost reminds me of Caesar 3.  Really feels more like a low complexity city builder than a Grand Strategy.  This game has alot of possibility, but just needs some fine tuning to make it replayable.  Replayability is where this game really falls short.\n\nI give this game a 5 of 10","June 4","true","113.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
