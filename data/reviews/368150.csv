The protagonist Faye is great. My favorite lady is Kika though, I just adore her self centeredness- I hope I can ship her and Faye, time will tell.\n\nAnyway, I am loving the story, I am extremely happy with my purchase. Awesome game, the choices I have been presented with so far have very interesting consequences. The storytelling is masterful, all the characters are vibrant and complex, very diverse and interesting. Excellent game. Very strongly recommend it, I am glad I found it while browsing here on steam.","March 20","true","3.9"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","16","19","2","0"

WORTH IT! Rising Angels: Red Rose (the first part of Rising Angels: Hope) was absolutely amazing but was pretty sad when it ended halfway. But, I preferred the art style for the characters in RIsing Angels: Red Rose but don't let this put you down because the story is amazing.\n\n10/10 would recommend","April 1","true","2.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

In fact, it is impossible for it to end in het. It's hilarious how BTFO the het gets.","April 12","true","4.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

The morality behind it is so questionable is actually disturbs me eveytime I think of the choices the writer made, creating this story, and the lessons we're to learn from it..  Wish there was options to actually make Faye pull away from this character...\n\n-A bit spendy\n\nThats it really, a great game so far, bit pricey.","April 29","true","8.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
