Just for clarity, let me state that I had already beat Millennium: A New Hope, and that I also only played the game on normal difficulty so my review will be based on those facts.\n\nIf you're a fan of the old 8-bit or 16-bit RPGs that were popular on the SNES or other systems, you're probably going to like this game.  It's very smooth, has nice artwork, good music, and I didn't have any problems with bugs.  Beating the game will probably take in the ten to fifteen hour range, depending upon how thorough you are in seeking side quests.  This game has a number, and you have to be a bit creative to discover them all without cheating.  The only ones I found a little superfluous were ones at the end where you basically went and had to hunt down gates in places you've already been.\n\nBut, I digress.  The story is set in a world where the lead character is Marine, a young girl who is living in a kingdom where a despotic ruler, Lord Dragon, with the help of some nefarious underlings, is running things where only a few benefit and many suffer.  So, she is trying to collect heroes to help fight him in a future election.  While searching these out, she goes on various misadventures.\n\nCombat is standard RPG menu based fare with basic attacks, accessible skills, defense, and item functions.  It can get a bit repetitive, but the game isn't too bad about making you work to level up at normal difficulty, and they offer easier modes called easy and story for those who want less of a challenge, and a harder mode as well for those who prefer.  Dungeons will take about an hour to two hours to clear.\n\nOne thing that is challenging is finding all the secret rooms.  Millennium 2 often hides secrets, so be sure to look and click around a lot.  Some players use the mouse mode to do a quick check of the screen to see where jumping off screen can lead you somewhere new.  These quests are almost never essential to the game, but something players should seek out because they offer substantial advantages to the characters in game.\n\nIt's a good game, and I'll be purchasing the third when it becomes available here on Steam.  For the price I paid, just under $5, it was definitely worth the cost in terms of entertainment, although the one thing that does frustrate me a little is reaching the end when it felt like it was just beginning.  But, in terms of producing these types of games, I've been a fan of Aldorlea for a while, and if you like games in the RPGMaker+ vein, this is as good as it gets.","July 15, 2014","true","21.0"," 31 of 39 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","31","39","0","0"

As the story progresses, it becomes a bit more thrilling, too. The length and number of quests / areas is similar to the previous game, so if you like the first one, this one is definitively worth playing.","July 11, 2014","true","5.5"," 35 of 50 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","35","50","0","0"

It starts off great.  You get to see Mystrock finally and the sheer difference between the peasants' way of life and that of the Mystrock citizens which adds to the overall lore of the series and we also get some more details about what Marine's quest is going to involve and actually get to meet some of your upcoming foes.\n\nThen the game takes a bit of a nosedive when you end up with just Benoit and Marine again and are looking for some more warriors.\n\nThe game definitely suffers a lot from the fact that Marine is easily distracted from her quest by her emotions.  We learn in this game that she very much wants to know what happened to her mother and she'll always help a person in need even if that may delay her a lot.\n\nSo overall it is a fun game, but it has a lot of low points and starts well and then sinks a bit untl you get some more party members and does finally improve.\n\nOverall pros:\n+More of a choice of party this time around.  You'll have more than 4 people available so you can try out some different choices.\n+Some great backstory and character development for Marine and Benoit and there are plenty of fun parts to the story.\n+The ability to import your save from the 1st game is really nice to help give an edge.  Also this game does have available some stuff that will be invaluable even through the last game.\n+Some of the more annoying achievement typs from the first game weren't included here which made it more fun to 100%.  There's no achievement for not using go-through, which makes it far more bearable to backtrack and no achievements for finding orbs\n\nOverall cons:\n-When importing you don't keep all your gold, stats and levels so the game can start off a bit harder than the end of the first game was due to this.  Importing does have an advantage because you'll have more gold and levels and you'll have most of your items as well.\n-Way too much focus on a certain massive spider and Jezebel's griffin.  The sheer amount of time spent on these quests made it very hard to suspend disbelief on how realistic things could be.\n-A decent amount of backtracking will be needed if you want to finish all the quests.\n\nOverall though, I do think the game is worth playing because the plot will enhance your experience in later games and many items you pick up in this game will be very valuable down the line.  While it is very possible to play the later games without having played all the previous ones, you'll be at a disadvantage for not importing a save and the overall experience will not be as good because you will have missed some plot points.  In good news though, the low points don't last too long, only up until you get your first warrior in this game.  There are enough good points that it's worth its asking price and you'll get a good solid about 15-20 hours of play from it.\n\nEdit to add: After having finished the whole series I do want to add a couple of points to this.  This game definitely is one that sets up some plot elements that will be fully resolved in the 4th and 5th games.  So while you can understand 4 and 5's plot fine without this one, it will mean a lot more if you've played this game and seen the setup.\n\nAlso, in the last area of this game you can get 99 diamond nuggets with a bit of grinding and also max out on some powerful healing items that can't be bought in any other games.  That fact alone will make things much easier in the later games, especially the achievments for earning gold.  Those diamond nuggets will save you a ton of grinding for gold and will help with some boosts to party members to make up for some of the losses you can take from starting a new game.","July 15, 2015","true","22.3"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","18","23","0","2"

It is a game that features the old style rpg gameplay that many of us have always enjoyed. And while there are many of these type games available ---- no one does them like Aldorlea.\n\nTo begin with, the storytelling in Aldorlea's games is excellent, engaging, and very deep with many curves that are surprising but not illogical. So, as a player, your interest is held from the beginning and remains throughout.\n\nThe graphics and animation are beautifully presented.\n\nMusic is surprisingly nice, and fits the circumstances of game events perfectly.\n\nLoads of quests to take on, and secrets to discover as you move through this story concerning the gathering of warriors that add up to 30-40 hours of gameplay with lots of replay value ---- and now with all the Steam achievements it simply means another replay for me! And I'm sure I will enjoy every minute of it. No one does these games like Indy, and at the current sale price the game is an absolute steal. I can't wait to see the other games in the series here at Steam ---- and, for that matter, ALL of the games from Aldorlea. They are that good.\n","July 11, 2014","true","0.5"," 22 of 34 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","22","34","0","0"

K.","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197973230221/","3588 products in account","Care Spoilers. The second of five parts. The story goes further searching new warriors for the battle, the rebellion against the rich suppressor Lord Dragon. This time we search in the west of the country then in the east like in part 1 and after the monk we founded, now we find another strong men that have his soft side like Hirado has it too. This time for the beauty of words and he is most time very helpful fighter only  1 time he is like Mr. T and his planes phobia from the A-Team because bad Juju he fears and again we get a tough woman in team that not hunts crocodiles but tame many dangerous animals. Both can be very useful.\n\nThis time you get at some points to get a bigger party like a second lovely fairy, a terminator robot and a thing that is helpful like Kapador from Pokemon, but maybe it evolve to something stronger in other games like a Garados Version, maybe something dragon like, who know without the people that had the luck to play 3-5 already. So you have the choice. Damn that the roboter cant update himself, it would be nice if he would get somehow leveling up like other maybe he could need longer for it so more exp he need and maybe some metals or other stuff, but that would be nice to upgrade him, too. But its fine.\n\nThe story is not much bigger then 1 but a great aspect with the mother comes in it and the end of 2nd part is great and sad, too. Nothing what no one could think before see it but damn its fine. The game has again 40 quest + 1 great bonus one and again you need to take care what to do first, because quest overlapping danger that you cant finish Quest 12 when you have finish 4, need to play hardcore to encounter all 8 bosses (normal 6, easy- very easy only 4) but its nice to take care, sure could be there sometimes a second solution like lending the book for quest 12  or MiniBoss Babys in Gigantic Lair for be a 2nd poxed chance but its only a few. The guide and/ or game could be mark this dangerous quest from the beginning somehow like RED for to it first priority but its fine. So it has 5 modes (story mode) and is really tough even with importing your save (items and co. from 1) and later to 3, the bosses can be really tough and frustrating but damn are you happy if you beat them, like starting weekend.\n\nThe quest are fine, some reminds on part 1 and some are tough again finding charms, gates or Bokden again that hides this time even better then in part 1. The 32 secret rooms are very helpful but really hard to find, the last one Nr. 7 in the autumn woods was even not in the guide so well good hidden it is and there are other secrets to find too like a house and a garden or a 2nd room you maybe need an item to find, all really great and hard to find but be happy if you done all 32 and get the many stuff out of it and find every piece that the developers make hard to find. I enjoy the game again very much only that you cant get the choice of getting back the items of Hirado, Katrine is hard, so take care before they leave your team, save often enough, they leave soon (Spoiler Hirado after Myst Town leaving and Katrina after beating the 1 boss in the underground after the earthquake) and take them their items back if you have them from game nr. 1 and second some areas you cant go back, so really check every corner with enter very well and enjoy, there are many secrets/ hidden objects everywhere.\n\nI hope you give this game a chance and maybe enjoy it. Its sad that so many people play game nr. 1 and write a review but Nr. 2 dont get this great support i give this game personal 9.4 of 10.0 points. The areas are great even a second ancient area, 2nd swamp area dont feel like the ones in game nr. 1, the music has good parts and some that are middle positioned. So check every map and corner and reach nearly 100 % of the game and hopefully you want like me play part 3 now. Thanks for reading and a great time.","October 25, 2015","true","22.1"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","9","16","0","5"

In it you will also meet some of the not -so-ethical opponents who will do their best to hinder Marine.The story extends to new areas with different scenery - quite breathtaking and new enemies. still has hidden rooms and quests. some of the animal kings can be hard to kill so leveling up and using skills is necessary. overall a great 2nd story","January 14","true","14.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Unfortunately part 2 of Millennium just isn't as good at all and reading reviews of the rest of the series I see that the main issues I have with part 2 only gets worse as it progresses.\n\nThe main storyline was much shorter than the first game. Things felt more unbalanced and there wasn't enough areas to explore to make all the traversing through the map feel anything but like a boring grind once I'd already visited a place.\n\nBut what really killed the game for me is how things are time sensitive. Unless you spend a lot of time searching every inch of the screen in the areas your character walk through you may later discover that you can't go back to that area. I like exploring and I had a lot of fun finding all the secret rooms in the first game. The first game had a time sensitive issue as well but not being able to buy all the things from the forge because I hadn't been aware of it  wasn't so dissappointing that I felt let down and I felt that I could easily replay the game on hard mode later and make sure not to forget the forge then.\n\nIn this game however I discovered that I had already lost the chance of completing all quests half an hour into my game since I had no idea I wouldn't be able to revisit Mystrock again once I left. It was a very disheartening discovery 15+ hours into the game that I wouldn't be able to complete two quests because I hadn't spent more time searching through the first town I went to before leaving it again.\n\nThis series makes me feel as if I need a walkthrough to guide me step by step through it if I want to complete all the quests. I usually don't want a walkthough until I've been stuck and desperate for a while.\n\nMillennium - Take me Higher just isn't fun enough to restart the game and replay it and I've lost the will to try the next part of the series.","September 8, 2015","false","29.0"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"
