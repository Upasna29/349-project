Well I can assure you I have played this game long before it came out on steam, in fact I remember its early betas and all its glorious bugs, plus I moderated the forums for a time as well. Before purchasing this game it is important to remember a few very important things.\n\n1. The game was made by the Minnesota Zoo and a few other educational institutions, as a result funding was very limited, and its amazing they put together this game with what meager scraps it got, it also caused controversy in the government here as people thought they the State was "wasting money" on creating "video games".\n\n2. This game has a heavy educational focus so others may find it quite boring, but if you want a glimpse into part of the struggle wolves go through this game helps paint a good picture.\n\n3. The graphics and mechanics are rather basic, as pointed out funding was exceedingly limited, furthermore this game is rather old, as games go, so it wont look as top notch as newer releases, however it does its job well.\n\n4. Multiplayer, they have added the pup raising missions which for a long time were removed due to safety and legal reasons, thew fact that this is added in will add a huge amount of fun for a group of friends to enjoy.\n\n5. The controls will take some getting used too but once you get the hang of it the game will feel and progress much more smoothly for the player. So have some paitence if your just starting out.\n\nI strongly recommend you buy this game, if for nothing else than to support several worthy causes, and hopefully show that there is a market for more simulator/educational games out there.","March 25","true","3.0"," 192 of 214 people (90%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","90","192","214","8","17"

This review, as it stands, is based on singleplayer only). ***\n\nI remember playing WolfQuest back when it was first created, and for its time and the purpose it was created for, it was enjoyable. WolfQuest was (and still is, in a form) freeware and can be accessed via the games external website. If you have never played this game I would recommend trying this out before buying this version, to prevent a build-up of negative reviews that do nothing but show someone hasn't done their research before taking the dive to purchase it.\n\nThat aside, this version has been updated with additional features, and with that a price tag to help support further updates and development (not like your usual ‘Early Access’ games, expect new things from WolfQuest. Especially since it looks like sales have exceeded the teams’ expectations!)\n\nPoints that I would like to see improved or added:\n\n- Camera: The camera angles were a significant problem for me. The camera was fixed, with only horizontal plane movement (where the option of movement via mouse was checked). When it came to my wolf using its super powers of defying gravity on the impossibly steep hills on the starting Amethyst Mountain map, the camera angles were very disorientating and only after a short time I had to avoid any terrain that wasn’t a gentle slope or flat as it became physically painful to tolerate after a short length of time – especially when I couldn’t look up a steep hill and all I saw was ground. A similar problem with the scent view where the camera is fixed slightly too low. I hope in future updates that free movement of the camera (vertical ‘up-down’ movement) is added so that players can move it to the lay of the land. Fixing the camera to head movement would also be a great addition, rather than having the wolf physically move to see in another direction.\n\n- Ambient Sounds: Would love to see an improvement and addition (i.e. more birds/animals) on ambience sounds.\n\n- Graphics: With the funding through sales, I hope improvements on textures and the additions of assets are made to improve the atmosphere of the game. I can see optimisation and finding a middle ground between younger players with potentially older/minimum specs and older players with higher specs, will be challenging. The game was released back in 2007 however, and I think an update in this area would be greatly appreciated by a lot of people.\n\n- Free roaming NPC’s: While wolf encounters and spawns of prey are in fixed areas, I would love to see free-roaming animals which would make for more dynamic gameplay.\n- Advanced tracking: As a tie-in with the above addition. Further signs of animals such as tracks, faeces, fur caught in bushes etc.\n\n- Drinking Water:\n\n\n\n\n\nDrinking.\n\n- Advancements on Stats and UI improvements: I.e. Thirst, Hunger. Easier in-game access to additional stats.\n\n- More factual information: As I have seen around the community hub, I think it would be a great idea to add real pictures and more in-depth information on the wolves we play. These could possibly pop-up upon certain activities and events.\n\n- Missions/Side Objectives: Apart from the one, main focus each section of the game, I would like to see plausible side objectives to improve re-playability value.\n\n\nAs the game stands, I’ve had difficulty deciding what to give this review, but in the end have gone with not recommended.\n\nThis is not for the game being bad! I have high hopes on updates and development in the future and would recommend anyone willing to support the efforts of the team to buy this game as it is currently. But if you’re dubious about purchasing it just yet, please do try the freeware version first!\nI will definitely come back to this review and update as development progresses and will hopefully change my rating soon! I will also add more improvements/additions I’d like to see or problems as I think of them too.\n","March 28","false","8.4"," 93 of 116 people (80%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","80","93","116","6","4"

Last I saw a new map was maybe 4 years ago, but this newer one is almost just as good as the others.\n\nThe Steam release gives you more skins and different howl sounds from what I have seen. Also experience points (and then some). I'm glad new things were added because it has been so very long. Paying the $10 for this new content instead of downloading for free, for what I assume is not getting updated, is worth it.\n\nAll in all, sure it is free on the official website but $10 is not that much. I also bought the game for nostalgia as well.","March 26","true","17.8"," 41 of 50 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","41","50","0","0"

It's still free, as version 2.5 on the WQ website, but buying this version off Steam is well worth the money. The paid version is a much more enjoyable experience, as a large number of bugs were fixed, the game was balanced better, there's improved graphics, a new map, extra features, etc. The developers aren't looking to make a huge profit for themselves by charging money, they've already put their own free time into this game without funding and are looking to use the funding received from sales (as well as feedback from players) to continue to improve this game.\n\nWQ is educational, but that doesn't mean that it's not a really fun game to play. I honestly love it, and even though I've been playing it for so many years I still find myself getting addicted to it again every so often. I first started playing this game when I was 9 years old, and I remember how well it drove my passions of science and animals, encouraging me to keep learning and become involved in discussions, as it was also the first online community forum I became a part of.\n\nI'm aware that simulation games aren't for everyone, but I've introduced this game to non-animal lovers and they've still enjoyed playing it simply for what it is as a game. I really recommend that everyone gives WolfQuest a go.","March 26","true","1.2"," 40 of 51 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","40","51","0","0"

This FINALLY made it onto Steam!!! I've been waiting...\n\nNow For the review :\n\n- I've seen some people complain about the Graphics, I have 1 Reply (Yes, It's cliché BUT it's true) Graphics are not everything... They really are not, and besides they are not too bad for a 2007 game with a small budget.\n\n- The Maps are very nicely made, sometimes they can feel a little empty but thats not a problem for me.\n\n- One of the main reasons I like this game is it can be played without the need for FULL attention, This means I can Watch YouTube and Stuff like that while playing, Basically it's a nice game to relax and play.\n\nAnyway I really would reccomend this game to anyone who thinks they like the look of it, or just LOVE Wolves like I do.\nMajor Kudos to the Devolopers of this game for adding extras like the Steam Badges, this just adds to the charm and I look forward to getting the badges, in fact by the time someone reads this I might just have the badge. In all great fun game to relax. Thank you for reading.

I'm excited to see the changes in store for WolfQuest, especially now that the game has a chance to reach new audiences. I bought it for a second time because I believe that the future is bright.\n\nThis game is still in development, and what you see here and now is not necessarily what is going to be present in the future. Keeping in mind that until recently, WolfQuest has been a nonprofit project, it's reasonable that there's not as much content as you might find in a triple-A title. Naturally, there are some hiccups and some bugs, as with any game, but they have never interfered much with the game as I've experienced it.\n\nFor being a game in what most would call "alpha", it's a beautiful game with a unique premise and an aim to educate. Most peoples' understanding of wolf behavior harkens back to the big bad wolf of old, and that has influenced the success of conservation efforts worldwide in a negative way. This game gives a unique look into the lives of the wolves of Yellowstone National Park, one that is unforgettable in every way.\n\nHere's to the future. Updates, additions, changes... whatever it holds, I'll be there, and I'm hoping others will be too.\n\nPS: Annoying bears for no reason is fun.","March 25","true","2.8"," 25 of 33 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","25","33","0","0"

The game's main purpose is to help players understand wolves and the roles they play in nature by playing a gray wolf themselves. You to learn about wolf ecology by living the life of a wild wolf in Yellowstone National Park and is a family-friendly, fun game for people of all ages.\n\nThe original game was released in 2008 and I was not aware of it until it came to Steam. The game has been tweaked for the Steam release with enhanced graphics, sound and gamplay features.\n\n\nPro's\nActive Developers (New features coming in June)\nFun relaxing gameplay.\nController support.\nVery challenging on difficulty levels "Arduos & Bring it on".\nIt's something different, I would like to see more games like this.\nLoading times are very short.\nCan play in servers with up to 5 players, hunting with other players is good fun.\nCon's\nPhrase chat in MP, this can be frustrating to communicate with.\nI like the Music in the game, however I'm not a fan of the guitar twang on every single attack hit you make.\nThe main game in its self is very short.\nThe world does feel empty but stuff like this is bound to be addressed.\nAI for your mate can somtimes go rogue and they just end up running off and doing something unlrelated to your task. (This is currentley being addressed)\nYou can run out of things to do fast.\nFinal Thoughts\nThe overall game is fairly basic and can get repetitive, but it is still fun and has replay value. Eduweb have so far been active with updates and have stated they have plans for the future. Afterall when the game made it to Steam they didnt expect the influx of players, that much so that their servers could not handle it and they needed to upgrade it to maintain connectivity with thier servers and Steam. We have been recieving patch's with game tweaks since day one so all is looking great from a support point of view. Eduweb has already said they would look into making more games like this and perhaps adding more content to Wolf Quest if they belive people would buy it.\n\nPlease see attached my 100% Achievement Guide.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=658506497\n\nSee you in the hunting grounds,\n\nFreerider-Dave","April 17","true","9.7"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","14","16","2","0"

I've been playing WolfQuest for roughly four years now and am also a newbie mentor on the WolfQuest forums and website.\n\nThe gist of WolfQuest is that you're a young adult wolf (two years of age) that just left its birth pack in search of a mate. After customizing your wolf, you're dropped into the Amethyst Mountain region of Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming. Your main goal is to attract a mate, which would be a dispersal wolf of the opposite gender. Once that task has been completed, you're taken to the Slough Creek region of Yellowstone. There, you have to claim a territory and eventually raise your own litter of pups, whose appearance will take after their parents (you and your mate). For the final quest of the game, you must take your surviving pups to a rendezvous site marked as a star.\n\nThere's also multiplayer, which consists of player-hosted servers that can host up to five players per game. There are two options: Raise Pups and Pack Life. Raise Pups is the entire Slough Creek arc of missions, meaning you and your "pack" (the other players) must ensure the safety and survival of a litter of pups. Pack Life can be anything, really. Exploring or hunting or roleplaying or just chatting. There's two versions of a multiplayer game: public and private. Public servers can be joined by any player, but the chatting options are very restricted. Private servers can be joined only by players who know the password to the server. The chatting options in a private server can vary from a restricted chat (phrase chat) to a very free chat (text chat). There is also the option of voice chat, in which the players can talk by inputting their voice. All of these options are selected by the host.\n\nThere's also a variety of improvements and additions. The first is accounts. In WolfQuest 2.5.1 (the previous version), if you somehow destroyed your computer or the WQ files are deleted, you lost your wolves and your saves. In WolfQuest 2.7, your files are constantly saved if you log into a special WolfQuest 2.7 account. That means you can play on an old computer, purchase a new computer one day, reinstall WolfQuest and continue right where you last saved. There's also more customization. In the old WQ, you had a choice of five pelts, a name, a gender, stats and the pelt tints. In WolfQuest 2.7, you get more pelts, a limp, scars, ear customization, a radio collar and howl types. And how about Lost River? Lost River is a new map that takes place near a creepy abandoned city. Trust me, it's freaky. In one part of town there's ominous messages spray-painted on the garage doors of houses. There's no sign of life except for an elk herd in the city, a carnival and papers flying in the air. The other parts of Lost River are relatively normal: mountains and rivers and rolling plains. Voice chat is also new to the game.\n\nI guess my only issues are some glitches, occasional lag and the graphics. WolfQuest is made from Unity, if I recall correctly, so you won't be seeing any next-generation graphics that look 100% realistic and smooth and all that here. It's not unbearable or terrible or anything, but the graphics aren't anything that would get a bunch of praise, honestly. In multiplayer servers, you might experience lag or your video driver stopping and then coming back. There's also some glitches littered around.\n\nOverall, this is a good game. If you want to see for yourself, don't get the full game. Download the free demo first. If you like it, buy it. If you're a fan of wolves and look for a proper wolf game, this is for you.","March 25","true","2.5"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sealedkyuubi/recommended/431180/","Sealedkyuubi","Direwolf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sealedkyuubi/","50 products in account","This is exactly what it says, a wolf simulator through and through. It looks pretty good compared to some of the other one's I've played and is easily the best wolf/dog simulator I've seen on steam. Same can be said for the sound (wildlife instead of music makes it seem more real). You literally feel like you are a wolf when you are dropped into the world and forced to hunt. Actually having to use your senses makes it interesting as does cutting off an elk from the group to get it, raising a family, and things like hunting bears requiring a pack of your own make it more realistic. However, the biggest negative for me were the controls. Using the keyboard feels okay though a few things are pretty unresponsive no matter how you set up things. Namely using a controller was impossible as things were just odd and too awkward to use (which sucks because that ruins the game to an extent for me anyway). That said, totally worth it if you like these type of games (or like me and just really like the canine family) then pick it up on sale. The asking price at the monent isn't really worth it.","April 20","true","11.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It was nice graphics for the time it was made (which I think is good in general), the soundtrack is great, the controls work really well, and it was interesting gameplay.\nThe starts off saying you're a two-year-old Gray Wolf in Yellowstone, that's looking for a mate and den to live in. You hunt about 8 Elk to get 800 exp. and then you go off to wolf territory to get yourself this wolf of your dreams..er, the wolf you created dreams.\nAfter you get your mate (which can take either a short time or a rather long time, one time it took me around 15 minutes because I didn't exactly understand what to do at first, haha), you can either stay on the mountain and explore and hunt more, or you can go to the creek where you will raise your cubs and start a family.\nNow, after you get to the creek, you look for a den. After you find the den you desire, you do a few more things to confirm the territory, and then the four puppies are born! If you have enough exp., you can name 'em. Naming the little things is pretty fun after a while, if I say so myself.\nAfter the pups are born and named/left un-named, you begin to take care of them! You have to keep them heathly, well-fed, and..well...alive, for the most part.\nAfterwards, you have to bring your puppies on a long and potentially dangerous journey. you have to keep atleast one cub alive until you reach your destination, and then, guess what? Congrats, you've finished the game!\n\nAnyways, sorry if that was a little too long. WolfQuest in my opinion is a 9.5 out of 10, and would be a 10/10 if it had told me I needed an account to get achievments..I spent hours getting all of 'em only to realize my steam account had not picked up on any I'd gotten and I had to completely restart everything. It was kinda annoying.","April 21","true","32.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Wolf quest is what you make of it. You create your character (a wolf of course) and have them do as you please- you make your own story. This game is not complex or deep but it is entertaining and a wonderful game to play when you're either bored or stressed out. I played this game for hours as a child when I was in my weird wolf obsessed middle school phase and it provided me hours of fun and good memories. For that reason I am glad to spend $10 and play it again and try out the new features. Its an entertaining game, its a good game. If you are looking for intense story lines and beautiful state of the art graphics- this is not for you. If you are looking for a nice wolf simulator game, looking to have a challenge and create your own story I recommend this game!\n","March 27","true","3.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IronBlockGames/recommended/431180/","IronBlockGames","Iron Block Games","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IronBlockGames/","84 products in account","Just going to say, it's a good game, but it has some flaws that need to be addressed.\n\nI use to play WolfQuest years ago when it was free and enjoyed it. After coming across a recent let’s play of it I was surprised to still see the game exist and was quick to support it as it looks like there working hard to build upon the foundation they had with the free version. That's great!\n\nYou can play Single Player or Multiplayer. Single Player is good to get use to the controls and the basics of the game. Outside that it's a bit boring and empty. You may see an elk once in a while or come across a stranger wolf to chase off or a bear, rabbits, coyotes, but mostly it's a lot of running around and gets boring rather quickly.  Multiplayer is where it’s at.\n\nThere are two types of game rooms for multiplayer... Public and Private with two games modes, Pack Life or Raise Pups with a max of 5 players per room. You need to know a room name and password for the private rooms as there's no room listing for it to show what's out there. There is a room listing for Public however. Public rooms are restricted to an emote based chat room. Meaning you have a listing of basic sayings to communicate with. Like "Let’s hunt!" "Okay!" Whereas Private Rooms have a proper chat room and even voice chat.\n\nHowever the drawback to the game now a days is unless you know someone or have a few friends to play with you'll rarely if ever get to really -play- the game outside single player.\n\nThe issue comes down to people want to join private rooms to have more freedom to type. You'll often find you enter a Public game to play, only for people to start going "Let’s make a private room!" "Will message you!" Then the host leaves ending the game. Even if you agreed to the private room, you'll unlikely get that promised message. Meaning its back to public rooms to see the same thing repeat.\n\nYou can make your own Public room, but you’ll be faced with the same still, people coming on, asking for a private room, then leave. I have tried being that one that makes the Private Game, sent out the message to the others, but no one joined. Thus back to Public rooms again to see the same thing play out.\n\nI have almost two hours into this game, and outside poking single player to get the hang of the controls. I have yet to really -play- the game. It’s just the same thing every time.\n\nJoin game\nSomeone: Let’s make private room!\nEveryone/You:  Yes/Okay/I agree!\nSomeone: Promises to message you!\nHost leaves ending game.\nNo message ever comes. Did the room ever get made? Never find out.\nRepeat with next public game you join.\n\nWolfQuest isn't a bad game if you have a few friends to play the game with. But if you're like me and don't have anyone else that plays, you'll likely face this same issue and struggle to sit down and enjoy the game.\n\nSo yes, I’d give this a 2/5 just for the fact that it shouldn’t be that hard to sit down and truly play the game with people. When you have yet to play a game after trying to for almost two hours, that’s not a good thing. If they address this then maybe I’ll come back, but for now it’s not worth sitting there for hours hoping you get a game going to play.\n\nFor some suggestions:  I would love to see more than just 5 players per map. Let you have more than one pack on a map, like rival packs you see in the wild. Let there be fights to take over the others pack or invade another packs area, or team up and form a joint pack. Add in bigger maps with more to them. Right now there’s a small selection of maps and most have the same theme. Smooth hilly Forest area with a river etching through it with an elk hunting zone. There’s one very hilly map with a road going through it, but I haven’t been able to explore it due to the above and not getting a game going. Let’s have more hidden dens, caves, little nooks to find and explore. Let us also play as the pups. Right now the pups have a basic sandbox mode to linger in a select spot, and mimic emotes you do. Outside that they don’t do much.\n\nTo end this, there is a lot that can still be done with this game. But when the core thing, -playing the game- is something you have to struggle to get going, it’s not worth it unless you have friends to play with you.","March 29","false","1.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","2"

During the journey, whenever eagles go to attack one of your pups, they are invisible and their deaths in inevitable. I've seen this be a problem for other players too, and it's really disappointing and unfair when you've done so much to keep your pups alive only for them to die from something you couldn't prevent.

The new customization options are awesome and allow for more personalitly to be given to your wolf, the updated AI is wonderful (the elk fighting back makes it far more challenging), and the new map Lost River is great to explore.  The graphics are refreshing and the music and sound effects are top knotch.  Also, different howls?  I love it.\n\nThere are a few odd bugs here and there, hopefully that can be smoothed out with future updates.  The most notable one is the slight delay in you not pushing down the forward/backward buttons and your wolf's reactionary stop.  Also, at Lost River, there's a bug when you run into a coyote, the tracking arrow will immediately point to another coyote and won't disappear until you kill it.  Otherwise, the game seems fine, and those should be patched in the future.\n\nThis game is great for educational purposes or if you just want to run around and hunt elk.  Yes, the game is older but the updates have helped it stand up to its fellows.  It's good to see that this game will be able to be funded again so that it can grow, and not to disappear into cyberspace as simply a memory.\n\nIf you like simulators and wolves, this is the game for you!\n(And also did I mention multiplayer pup raising?)","March 26","true","12.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

You can choose from 2 different play style modes: Pack Life, and Raising Pups. Pack life is what it sounds like you're in a map with other players and you basically just hang out/RP or go hunt stuff but Raising Pups allows the server owner to give birth and multiple players can choose a den site and raise the pups together. But just like the single player mode the multiplayer pups game doesn't last very long at all and once you complete bringing the puppies to the "star on the map" the game is over. Only thing new is a new map and customization.\n\nTO THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE NEVER PLAYED:\nLook above, you play as a wolf in various settings like forests in Yellowstone to abandoned towns. You can join up with other packs on multiplayer and "live the life as a wolf" but in reality you're going to be doing the same mundane tasks over and over again. Sadly in multiplayer you can only have "phrase chat" which basically only allows you to talk in the chat by clicking on pre-set words the game gives you. If you want to be able to talk openly you'll have to go into a private match, customization is a nice addition to this game you can choose pelt styles, your color, ears styles, radio collars, and even scars, your howl type, and even a limpy leg which will allow you to stand out in the pack. In my personal opinion WQ tends to get pretty boring after 30 mins. to an hour of  playing as there really isn't anything to do...Hopefully now that the game is being treated as such we'll get more content that will help with this.\n\nAll in all Wolf Quest is pretty fun, I've been playing for years and I'm really happy to see that it's finally being treated like an offical game, and that it will hopefully keep growing to be a wolf survival game that everyone's been wanting. The price for this game isn't bads at all and I'd honestly say it's pretty worth it if you have friends to play with!","April 30","true","5.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Issues in the older game like relfections showing up on land awkwardly in slough creek are gone thank god. The game also has a lot more sounds making it feel more nature like.\n\nBugs/Complaints\n\nReflections are..bizarre when you first enter Slough creek in the winter go across the water you will see what I mean\n\nAuto saving is nice but it lags me during very inconveniant times\n\nThe AI for your "mate" Could use some work my mate will run off with pups and make getting to my summer home a lot more difficult my mate also seems to lack proper hunting when we attempt to hunt when they hunt alone they do fine.\n\n\nSuggestions: Add more animals perhaps more packs, Maybe Add  Disease, or even human hunters who may try to kill you and your family if you manage to kill the calf in the farm.\n","March 25","true","10.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The single player is a little short if you know what you're doing but the multi-player has great potential for roleplaying (if you create a private chat in Steam rather that the Wolf Chat ingame which is /very/ restrictive).\nThere are lots of wolf coats, stats and howls to choose from which makes it feel quite personal and because the community isn't massive, when you're in multi-player you never feel out ranked or out played.\n\nI don't know if it's quite the right price (personally I think it could be a little cheaper for those who would only be interested in singleplayer) but if you're really into wolf simulation then this is an amazingly fun little game to play :)\n\n9/10 - would reccommend! ****/***** stars :)","April 2","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was a fun little wolf game where you found a mate and raised your puppies. I'm happy to see that they are still working on this game.\n\nThis is pretty much a wolf simulator where you can well... see what it's like to be a wolf. The developers of this game really want you to feel like you're living the life of a real wolf. So that means no goofy colors, no exotic customizations (tatts, piercings, y'know...), etc. The developers also do not take lightly to players who are rude to other players so their chat in multiplayer is where you can select from a list of what to say. Private games allow you to have voice chat, type chat, etc. But private games require a password. So if you can somehow manage to befriend someone through selected chat, you can start a private game with them (there is an add friend option, then message option).\n\nPros (to new and old players):\n-New ways to customize your wolf (while still keeping the feel of a natural wolf)\n-New additions to old maps\n-New map\n-Secrets to explore/come across\n-More expressions\n-Find an NPC love\n-Raise NPC puppies\n-Raise pups with real players\n-Hunt\n-Weather changes\n-Daytime/night time\n-Enjoyable OST\n-Achievements\n-Game modes\nAnd much much more.\n\nCons:\n-Camera can be a little loopy sometimes\n-The occasional glitch/bug\n-No option to switch out of "parent approved" chat in public multiplayer game (Although I do like the fact that the admins kind of what you to make friends then add friends, get to know them, and then talk through typing/voice. But I don't see why strangers would pick on you. I mean c'mon! you get to be a wolf! That's awesome! You can pick on people on ♥♥♥♥♥)\n-No minimap (you'll understand why this is a con)\n\n\nEverything about this game is great. I hope the developers continue to work on this game.\n\nOh and if you want to add me... My username is FleshMachine\n;)","April 1","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

I consider it more of a wolf simulator than a true survival game. You do have to survive off the land by hunting game and fending off preditors, but it focuses on more of the wolf life. Finding a mate, raising pups in a den, and protecting them till they grow up. The game is rather short, about 5 hours of play time, but it was still enjoyable. Most of your play time will be through the different difficulties and achievments. Wolf customization is fun to, you can even give your wolf different trait bonuses between strength, stamina, and speed.","April 4","true","33.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
