Feeling like no one understands you or bothers to even care about your issues. Kind of having deep conversations with yourself, and fighting with yourself. Depression is terrible and I wouldn't wish that on anyone...so to see this kind of scenario actually laid before me in such a well written manner was refreshing..but also saddening. Although I wouldn't handle most of my situations like the main character did, I could still empathize and actually feel care towards the character. In my opinion this game is something everyone should play and give a thought to..even if its only just once. There's a bunch of reading..well its basically an "interactive story", but it was well worth the read.The author makes valid points towards the current state of society, how we treat our fellow man, and things that most people wouldn't publicly say. I honestly hope whoever reads this will pick this game up and see for themselves.\n\n"Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem."

This is the game for you. It's also for the people that have friends going through this.\nThe game is very text heavy, there is no gameplay as such. It's more an interactive story on social commentary, past events and life as some people know it. It's a work of art.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IceoAwesome/recommended/288040/","IceoAwesome","Iceo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IceoAwesome/","238 products in account","Actual Sunlight is an indie title about depression.\n\nThis game contains strong triggers towards thoughts and feelings such as suicide and depression. Please make sure you are in a strong mental well-being before playing this game. I have listed all the suicide hotlines that I know of, they are available below.\n\nYou will probably never play a game quite like  Actual Sunlight.\n\nThe story follows a man named Evan Winter, who is struggling with depression. Straight away you sense that he has lost nearly all hope, and is only hanging on because he hopes it will pass.\n\nEvan‚Äôs problems are taking their toll. He works for a company he doesn‚Äôt respect, with many employees he doesn‚Äôt respect, he is overweight and wants to try and change that, but work is dragging him down.  He keeps spending money on video-games when he thinks he is wasting his life. Everything in his life seems to have a problem with it, which leaves him with such a depressed mind that no matter how hard he tries to be optimistic, everything seems to be overwhelming to the point where he can‚Äôt see past the bad.\n\nEvan has been given advice from people on how to live his life. About how he should ‚Äúlighten up,‚Äù or how he should look at the world. Things that many depressed people have been told. But it isn‚Äôt helping them, because it is a mental issue, so merely changing your perspective on something won‚Äôt help because the thing you need to change isn‚Äôt an easy issue to fix. Evan will laugh it off or make self-deprecating jokes, or merely try to deny it. But underneath is that little bit of honesty that they really hope you hear, because they are too scared to say it directly.\n\nActual Sunlight  was made with RPGMaker by one man, Will O‚ÄôNeill. But behind it‚Äôs simple graphics is an incredibly powerful story.\n\nThis ‚Äúgame‚Äù is brutally honest with it‚Äôs writing, it‚Äôs like being in the head-space of someone or reading their diary, it is SO incredibly personal. But I do think it contains a story that needs to be played by people to truly understand what it is like, at least to the best possible ability. It isn‚Äôt a game I would recommend to someone going through depression unless they feel they can 100% handle it. But I do think anyone with a family member, friend or colleague that might have depression, should play this game, so they can truly understand their loved one.\n\nThis game isn‚Äôt one I can score, because it would be like trying to score someone‚Äôs life, someone‚Äôs thoughts, someone‚Äôs journey, it would almost invalidate everything I have said. But if you have a loved one suffering through depression, take the hour and a half to finish this game and try to understand what they must be going through. It‚Äôs a rough journey, but you should be by their side to the best of your ability.\n\nIf you need help, please talk to someone or contact your country‚Äôs suicide hotline below.\n\n_______________\n\nSUICIDE HOTLINES\nAlbania: 127\nArgentina: (54-11) 4758-2554\nAustralia: 13 11 14\nAustria: 142\nBarbados: (246) 4299999\nBelgium: 106\nBotswana: 3911270\nBrazil: +55 51 211 2888\nCanada - Greater Vancouver: 604-872-3311\nCanada - Toll free-Howe Sound/Sunshine Coast: 18666613311\nCanada - TTY: 1-866-872-0113\nCanada - BC-wide: 1-800-SUICIDE (784-2433)\nChina: 0800-810-1117\nChina (Mobile/IP/extension users): 010-8295-1332\nCroatia: (01) 4833-888\nCyprus: +357 77 77 72 67\nDenmark: +45 70 201 201\nEstonia (1): 126\nEstonia (2): 127\nEstonia (3): 646 6666\nFiji (1): 679 670565\nFiji (2): 679 674364\nFinland: 01019-0071\nFrance: (+33) (0)9 51 11 61 30\nGermany (1): 0800 1110 111\nGermany (2): 0800 1110 222\nGermany (youth): 0800 1110 333\nGhana: 233 244 846 701\nGreece: (0) 30 210 34 17 164\nHungary: (46) 323 888\nIndia: 2549 7777\nIreland (1): +44 (0) 8457 90 90 90\nIreland (2): +44 (0) 8457 90 91 92\nIreland (3): 1850 60 90 90\nIreland (4): 1850 60 90 91\nIsrael: 1201\nItaly: 199 284 284\nJapan (1): 03 5774 0992\nJapan (2): 03 3498 0231\nKenya: +254 20 3000378/2051323\nLiberia: 06534308\nLithuania: 8-800 2 8888\nMalaysia (1): (063) 92850039\nMalaysia (2): (063) 92850279\nMalaysia (3): (063) 92850049\nMalta: 179\nMauritius: (230) 800 93 93\nNamibia: (09264) 61-232-221\nNetherlands: 0900-0767\nNew Zealand (1): (09) 522 2999\nNew Zealand (2): 0800 111 777\nNorway: +47 815 33 300\nPapua New Guinea: 675 326 0011\nPhilippines: 02 -896 - 9191\nPoland (1): +48 527 00 00\nPoland (2): +48 89 92 88\nPortugal: (808) 200 204\nSamoa: 32000\nSerbia: 32000\nSingapore: 1800- 221 4444\nSouth Africa: 0861 322 322\nSweden (1): 020 22 00 60\nSweden (2): 020 22 00 70\nSwitzerland: 143\nThailand: (02) 713-6793\nUkraine: 058\nUnited Kingdom (1): 08457 909090\nUnited Kingdom (2): +44 1603 611311\nUnited Kingdom (3): +44 (0) 8457 90 91 92\nUnited Kingdom (4): 1850 60 90 90\nUnited Kingdom (5): 1850 60 90 91\nUnited States of America: 1-800-273-TALK (8255)\nZimbabwe (1): (263) 09 65000\nZimbabwe (2): 0800 9102\n\nDisclaimer: This review was written gradually over 6 or so months, if others have voiced their opinions that have been voiced similar to mine over that time that is by coincidence.","December 10, 2014","true","1.4"," 70 of 83 people (84%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","84","70","83","4","13"

I'm not in my late 20s/early 30s. I'm not working a job I neither love nor care for.  I'm a college kid from China studing economics here in the States. Oh, and I do cook pretty well, and my obsession with precisely following Ikea's assembly instructions proved to be a bit overwhelming to the few friends I have.\n\nOther than that, it's pretty close. I'm in an alien country, spending money I don't have learning stuff I neither love nor am good at, getting by with passing grades, lying to my parents that everything's fine so they wouldn't completely lose faith in me and their decision of funding my study, and of course, escaping into videogames. I live with four roommates under the same roof who each lives their own lives and barely social at all. I've no idea if I would ever find a job, or even complete this degree. I've gained 40 pounds since I came here, and the mirror image of Evan is not far from myself. Hell, I even have a similar "relationship" like Evan and Tori with my ex, my first date, who I broke up with 4 years ago. And for the past four years, I've been living with my broken promise, which I never told her, that I would make a man out of myself one day and finally face her with confidence, along with dozens of other promises I could not keep.\n\nI've seen my university's counseling service precisely once.\n\nI'm pretty sure I just failed a class I have to pass in order to proceed to a dozen of courses to complete my degree.\n\nI've been keeping a sharp-tipped fruit knife within my arm's reach for the past three days.\n\nI woke up early this morning after 5 hours of medically-enhanced sleep, and I run into Kotaku UK's article "How Video Games Can Help With Depression", in which Actual Sunlight was mentioned. I found a let's-play on YouTube, and two minutes into it, I knew this is a game I need right ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing now. Only $5. It's not like I haven't been wasting hundreds of dollars on games already.\n\nPlaying through the game took me 1.5 hours. It was 1.5 hours of storming emotions, mixed with pre-coffee, early-morning drowsiness. I completely understood every single word, and every single pulse behind those words. It is the life I've been living for the past four years.\n\nAnd it feels good to know there're people out there. People out there who really understands.\n\nAnd, although the game's ending *minor spoiler* is not exactly happy, I feel strangely motivated. It pinned down every negative emotion that's been bombarding me constantly, like scalpels cutting around a gulping tumor, summarizing everything I want to be rid of.\n\nBut mostly, it's just nice to know that there're people out there who understands.\n\nAnd, coming back to it, it wets my eyes that the author put down that one line:\n\n"Don't you ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing dare."\n\nSo I won't. I'm gonna put up one more fight. I've made choices and I had my consequences, but there's still chance. I'm still depressed, but now I actually feel that I'm not alone, and there are those out there who are still putting up there own fights, and there's no excuses for me to give up my own.\n\n===\n\nI know this is not technically a review, but I'd say this reviews the game better than any actual review and accurately reflects what the player is signing up for.\n\n\nBTW, I just realized that I unintentionally threw that knife away along with a bunch of litter in a cake box.","December 16, 2014","true","2.9"," 45 of 51 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","45","51","0","0"

I don't mean mature as too much violence mature. Actual Sunlight tackles a very tough subject. Depression. If you are depressed, don't play this, because it will get you even more depressed. Even if you're not depressed, this game will very likely make you sad if you pay attention to its story.\n\nMy hours played do not seem like much here, but I bought this game before it's steam release and played it through, and it was amazing.\n\nActual Sunlight is probably the most accurate depiction of depression in a game to date. It can hardly be defined as a game, really. It is more of an interactive story. Don't let that stop you though, if you're not depressed, you'd be doing yourself a favour by buying it. I can't go into a too in depth review without giving to much away, but it is about a young man named Evan Winters who is suffering from depression. I believe that a lot of people can relate to what he's going through, even if not depressed.\n\nThe game was made with RPG maker, so expect the graphics you see in the screenshots. If you don't like reading too much, you may not want to buy it, but that would be a mistake.\n\nAt this price, this is a story worth reading and seeing.\n\n9/10","April 3, 2014","true","1.2"," 41 of 48 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","41","48","0","2"

There's a raw reality, sadly, in the unavoidable conclusion of this game. Some might appreciate this, but this is definitely a marmite scenario because I'm not sure if you should play this game when you are depressed or at a very low point. Reaffirming what your most negative thoughts are about yourself, does not seem like a wise thing to do and this game does not offer much hope, just affirmation.\n\nThe game itself in terms of mechanics is more of an interactive story, whereby you have little sway on the outcome. It's a basic style, done in RPGMaker and the creator has put effort in where he can with little touches and the  dialogue. That said this game is dialogue heavy. The narration screen which projects the thoughts of the lead character is what you'll see more than the environment.\n\nThis is not a bad game, it's simple, it comes from a powerful and real place, but I think that I would not reccommend it, based on my own conflicts with being stuck in depressive ruts. That's not to say it's awful at all.\n\nI wrote a piece about how it's ok to not play depression based games, when you are depressed or going through stages of depression, which might explain my personal thoughts (though I could say much more).\n\nhttp://www.destructoid.com/blogs/GlowBear/it-s-ok-not-to-play-depression-games-279830.phtml/","November 9, 2014","false","2.3"," 53 of 69 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","53","69","0","5"

You can swim fine, you can handle it, stop drowning"\n\nActual Sunlight is an interactive text based short game that talks about depression. Depression is not an easy subject to discuss nor is it easy to relate to in our case. I've been exposed to the topic and have few people in my life with Clinical Depression, It was tough for me to deal with them and support them but there is no way I can imagine what they are going through. Actual Sunlight has one of these cases and from what I've been through, you know you hit rock bottom when you start contemplating suicide. That is probably the intention behind this game, to bring awareness to the whole topic.\n\nI've been torn on whether I would recommend this game or not. There are many reasons for both in my own opinion. For example, I'd recommend it if it would raise awareness to depression and familiarize people with the topic so they can find a way to support someone before it is too late. I'd not recommend it because it is not a very engaging experience, however, that would be quite offensive to the experience on "Evan Winters". I decided I'd go with recommending it only because it is not a simple topic and I'd be happy knowing this game could spark a feeling for someone.\n\nFor the full review, check http://mouseandcontroller.blogspot.com/2015/11/actual-sunlight.html","July 2, 2015","true","4.2"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","19","23","0","0"

It's just sad."\n\nActual Sunlight is best described as an interactive short story portraying a man fighting a losing battle with depression; as the protagonist's dark thoughts get the best of him his hate for himself and his own life send him down an ever darker spiral.\nThere's not much of a game here but its strong narrative, great writing and rarely touched subject matter make Actual Sunlight an experience worth considering for those strong enough to face its bleak, hopeless nature.\n\nPROS:\n\n-top notch writing creates a great, mature narrative\n\n-the few artwork pieces used in the game are simple yet beautiful\n\n-good soundtrack\n\n-holds no punches when it comes to subjects such as depression, suicide, self-hatred, abuse etc...\n\n-will easily evoke strong emotions and/ or provide some food for thought\n\nNEUTRAL:\n\n-the themes presented will be too much for some, the game is crude and bleak and could easily cause discomfort to gamers who are either too sensitive or too close to the subject matter\n\nCONS:\n\n-some phrases can feel a tad too stereotypical\n\n-very short, you'll be done in an hour\n\n-little to no player input is required\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=583351845\n\nActual Sunlight is an experience...a bleak, raw, thought-provoking, emotional journey that is sure to stir strong emotions in its audience. There's basically no light or hope here, the story goes on and meticulously chronicles the feel of desperation, self-loathing and hopelessness that many people fightning with depression face every day. There can be a few bitter laughs here and there though, if you're a cynic like yours truly, when the game provides some social commentary on how relationships or job seeking work nowadays.\n\nEvan Winter, the game's protagonist, is on the far end of the depression spectrum but there's no denying that many people will feel familiar with at least a few of his thoughts, actions and feelings: hereby lies Actual Sunlight's true strength as the game lets you project your own uncertainty and discomfort onto the tale being told.\n\nIs this story one for you? It's honestly hard to say...I was deeply touched by Actual Sunlight and personally feel it'd be experienced by basically everyone at least once, provided you won't be upset or disgusted by its themes. I must also warn you though, just as the dev does ingame, that this story could also push you further down a dark path if you're having issues yourself so tread accordingly.","December 25, 2015","true","2.9"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"

There's almost no traditional gameplay in it. You play it not for "fun", but rather for an emotional experience and perhaps for some insight into the psychology of depression.\n\nIf you're still reading, then maybe you're open-minded enough to get something out of this game. You play as Evan Winter, an overweight white-collar drone who tries to bury his loneliness in video games, daydreams, and misanthropy. Gameplay consists of guiding Evan through a few days in his overly routinized life, interacting with other characters and environmental objects in order to trigger Evan's dark and sardonic commentary (the game is very text-heavy). As the game progresses through its roughly hour-length, Evan's depression becomes increasingly severe. There is only one possible ending no matter what choices the player makes along the way. And with a name like "Evan Winter" ... brace yourself.\n\nOne of the things I liked the most about "Actual Sunlight" was how the developer took advantage of the unique features of video games as a medium in order to convey Evan's psychology in a visceral way. The graphics are mostly flat, basic, and bland; environments are constricted; and the narrative choices given to the player are ultimately illusions -- exactly how Evan feels about his own life. Which is not to say that "Actual Sunlight" asks you to agree with Evan's worldview, but rather to take a walk in his shoes as a cautionary tale. When the game is over, the player must do something that Evan also does every day: put down his/her own controller, return to "real life," and ponder the choices that they may not have even been aware that they were making. The difference is that we have Evan's example to learn from.\n\nSounds like a party, right? ;) Buy "Actual Sunlight" if you are looking to think and feel more than to "play," and if you are capable of handling dark subject matter. It took me a couple tries to get into it, but ultimately I'm glad that I did.","July 6, 2015","true","3.8"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

It is not a game for the faint of heart, but in its dialogue and dramatic scenes lies a tale of understandable sorrow. The sorrow of never quite knowing one's self or one's worth is a burden that can truly drive one to the brink, and for Evan, the brink is always on his horizon. Dreaming of a better life with a better job, better coworkers, better relationships, and better hobbies eventually cuts into Evan's comprehension of reality and what it means to truly be alive. In this narrative, the player and Evan will discover what life is, its meaning, and what it is to have the power to overcome the obstacles one faces with that knowledge. Sometimes the knowledge, the freedom from the surrounding obstacles, comes at a terrible price; but Evan, trapped in a world of constant fluorescence, truly, honestly, and simply wants the feeling of Actual Sunlight.","October 29, 2014","true","1.5"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","16","19","0","2"

It is a portrait." The person it portrays is perhaps relevant to many who read this review - but it is in no way supporting of morbid things such as suicide (one doesn't have to relate to appreciate the Actual Sunlight experience, but someone interested in psychology and / or mental illnesses will probably be intrigued by Actual Sunlight.)\n\nThe out-of-character message was added to explain his concern for who comes across the game and possible negative reactions (or triggers, if you prefer) - and to switch and say out-of-character "That ain't you. So don't. Don't you ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing dare." (Here you have to remember what the game deals with - i.e. suicide.)\n\nI agree with the reviews shown on the shop page that are taken from other sources than Steam reviews. It's a powerful portrait, perhaps because the developer refers to himself in the out-of-character message.\n\nI recommend it to people who are not searching for the common perception of "video game", but a psychological experience. It would also have to be someone willing to pay its worth (base price 5 EUR / USD) for a short amount of game time. Few people will spend hours on it (including those who do several playthroughs, even though there's not really replayability), and most may just spend minutes on it before they complete the story and catch the point.\n\nHowever, before considering buying, follow the trigger warnings. How do you react to powerful depression- and suicide-themed novels, music, real-life stories or whatever?\n\nActual Sunlight deals with serious topics, and I'm not sure how much courage it took the developer to create this. All-in-all I appreciate the developer sharing this portrait and do not regret my 4.49 Euro spent on it, but rather would do it again and will look for other interestingly-named titles from Will O'Neill.","April 4, 2014","true","4.7"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","2"

Like many have said, it is an accurate representation of the thoughts and mindset of a suicidally depressed person, accurate to the point that I worry about anyone who has these thoughts or feelings playing this game and emulating the protagonist. The game is linear. Plot points are unlocked by making certain decisions and talking to other characters in a specific order. It was almost reminiscent of Takeshi's Challenge in that way, but unlike Takeshi's Challenge, decisions you make in Actual Sunlight have little to no effect on the progression of the game. In fact, the only decision the game lets you make is the order in which you talk to the characters around you to progress the storyline, which leaves you feeling like the ending is inevitable, another thought that someone suffering from clinical depression might have. The game is so spot-on with the symptoms of depression that the developer threw in an in-game note urging young people to not follow in the protagonist's footsteps, which is a nice thought, but I feel it could have been worded much better and overall read as something he felt obligated to do given the subject matter of the game. In short, this game could be a great tool for those who have never felt suicidal to understand what a friend or loved one is going through, but it may not be the best thing for someone going through a dark moment in their life to play.","May 20, 2014","true","1.6"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

It is a somber story that certainly does not start in a happy place, but it only sinks lower from there. Depression is not an easy thing to talk about, and Actual Sunlight does not attempt to shy away from every thought that comes from a dark place. The protagonist expects a stranger to try to strike up a conversation with him as he gets on the bus, getting annoyed that some stranger would try to talk to him in a pathetic attempt to make friends, but then the stranger simply tells him something mundane, like his shoes are untied. The protagonist feels stupid for hoping that someone would talk to him, just so he could reject them, but only finds out that he was the one who was pathetic enough to want human contact with a stanger on a bus. He uses videogames and material things to drive away the emptiness he feels inside. He thinks his co-workers are terrible, but he envies them. Nearly everything sends him into a feeling of bitterness and defeat.\n\nFinishing Actual Sunlight is not so much rewarding as it is sobering. The gameplay aspect has you interacting with objects and people as you walk around in an oldschool JRPG perspective. There is little to be done besides exploring the environment and talking to other characters, which just peels away more layers of melancholy.

What he writes is awful but has glimpses of truth. Lost in his own internal fantasies, he crushes himself and others in an internal, negative monologue which overlays his world. Like so many of us, he attemptes to sate the emptiness inside with electronics, video games, and alcohol -- only to find the next day that he is still himself, he is still full of unrealized dreams, and he is no step closer to happiness.\n\nWhat is maddening about Actual Sunlight is that we never see a positive glimmer. There is only a suffocating blanket of despair and self-loathing, which extends to every object and person in Evan's world. He is an estranged being who never grew into the ideals gently and lovingly given to children, that concept of being able to be whoever you want. Even feels entitled to a better life, but he makes no effort to get it. His dreams flop uselessly inside him, and the rage builds.\n\nThe game ends crushingly. There is no redemption, no change, no hope. If this game is attempting to be a message encouraging others to not let their lives fold out like Evan's, it missed the mark somewhere.

Actual Sunlight zooms in on the themes of depression, suicide and the feelings of loneliness and uselessness in a very, very direct way, hitting one straight in the face time after time after time. It does so alsmost exclusively by using text, text one has to scroll through by hitting enter again and again and again. There's not much more "gameplay" except for walking around your depressive character in a generic environment and talking to objects and people. This triggers ... more text ofcourse. Whole the time, one gets confronted with ideas and opinions about how bad/gross modern society is to its core.\n\nNow I don't have a problem with text-based games as such - back in the 1980's several excellent games were text-based -, but the actual texts used here, and the way the different themes are handled, is really too grim and too "in-your-face" for me. Having experienced the loss of a loved one to suicide quite recently, I could hardly bear playing this. Themes like these presented in such a direct way as here, should imo be the subject of therapy-sessions in a well cared-for, safe environment. To punch this through one's throat as it's being done here, may help in making a point, but it's not healthy for the ones playing or rather reading it....

I chose to give Actual Sunlight a "thumbs-up" because it's well made, not because I had a good experience playing it. At any rate, I think it's best to look at what I will say below as a warning or observation rather than a review.\n\nFirst of all, this isn't really a game. It's a narrative experience centered on Evan Winter, a man who thinks he's worthless. The only things to do in Actual Sunlight are examine objects and talk to NPCs. The only choice you have is in which order to do them. Each interaction you perform presents a written vignette that will gradually lead you deeper into Evan Winter's troubled life. Through talking to a limited cast of characters and examining Evan's home and work environments, you will learn about how his life has gone stagnant and gain insight into exactly what Evan thinks of himself, his culture, and his circumstances. These vignettes are sometimes humorous (in a cynical way) or sad, but they always seek to illustrate the profound loneliness of Evan. It took me about an hour and a half from start to finish.\n\nThe writing is good. That, almost exclusively, is what will carry you through the experience. But when you finish reading the last sentence of Actual Sunlight, you're not going to be smiling. You might not even feel the satisfaction of having read a well-told story... even though the writing does deserve praise. Here's the catch: if you suffer from depression or social anxiety, like I do, reading through Actual Sunlight can be triggering. If you play this game, you are going to stand in the shoes of a man who has no hope and thus no future. If you think (mistakenly) that you are even remotely in the same situation, then please consider firing up some zombie-killing simulator instead. It'll make you feel better than following Evan Winter around.\n\nActual Sunlight is unrelentingly, brutally harsh and dark. There is no redemption to be found here and certainly no happy ending. This game seeks to embrace the old idiom: "sometimes the light at the end of the tunnel is a train." It's like witnessing a horrendous car wreck and trying to make sense of it. Can you? Is there any meaning or purpose in something like this? Why did I play this game? I appreciated the quality of most of the writing, but I certainly didn't have fun. In fact, I feel pretty bummed out.\n\nSo there. There's your warning, and I got something off my chest. Now where's that shortcut for Plants vs. Zombies? <click-click>","March 4","true","1.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's the story of someone who is permanently mired in depression, self-hatred, and crushing hopelessness. The narrative is primarily the protagonist's own twisted introspections and personal observations of the world around him. The gameplay brings you through his life, as he lives it. It feels like taking a tour through an exhibit of someone's mental illness.\n\nThe game is short, but the story is fairly compelling. It has a fullscreen mode, but no configurable video settings beyond that. It has controller support, but the analog movement lacks precision and the d-pad doesn't seem to work (I use an Xbox 360 controller), so you might be better off with keyboard controls (arrow keys and Z).\n\nOverall, I'd give this game a solid recommendation if you like stories that deliver a strong message, but aren't necessarily meant to be happy.","April 3, 2014","true","1.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

It doesn't give you much choice or agency over what you do in the game but that's somewhat the point, and it's an interesting few hours to say the least. To quote a few reviewers -- ‚Äòit is quite possibly a dangerous game [‚Ä¶] a game that could drive someone to depression or worse‚Äô (TP Review), ‚Äòthis game probably shouldn‚Äôt be played if the you have suicidal thoughts, a tendency towards self harm, or are just plain not having a good day‚Äô (Penny Arcade), the game is ‚Äòwritten in such a way as to make the player consider their own lives, and there are clear attempts to draw parallels between the gamer and the character‚Äô (The Indie Game Magazine).

I thought I couldn't be that bad. I was wrong.\n\nThis game was made in RPGmaker, however is is an amazing game.\n\nI cannot stress this enough; If you suffer from depression or are depressed, be very weary of this game, it hits you very hard.\n\nYou are Evan Winter. A middle aged overweight failed writer. You live in apartment alone. You jack off every night. You hate your job, your co-workers don't really understand you and everyday you think about throwing yourself off of your apartment complex roof just to end it all.\n\nThis game goes through Evan Winters life and how monotonous and repetative it is. He wants to change to be a better person but it is already too late. He lies to his family saying everything is okay. His only escape is drinking.\n\nEvery day tasks are made into a complex puzzle and everything is questioned.\n\nSlowly you see Evan getting more and more depressed to the point where he is borderline insane.\n\nEvan Winter is an in-game representation of the developer as this is very similar to what he went through. The game breaks the fourth wall as the developer speaks to you directly and tells you not to ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• up like he did.\n\nThere isnt much story to the game neither is there much gameplay, consider it more of a text adventure. However the writing in this game is superb and a guarantee that a few lines of text will hit you hard, they did for me. It makes you think and contemplate your life and think where will I be in x amount of years.\n\nThe game is very short and only goes through about 3 days of Evans life.\n\nInteract with EVERYTHING, seriously each object brings up new text or an event. Some of them are very clever.\n\nThis game will suprise you and shock you and has a sad ending.\n\nI give this game a solid 9/10.","April 21, 2014","true","2.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Sometimes, I have to go back through the game a second time, or spend a few days thinking about what I will write in order to accurately recommend the game to others. However, I've decided to change things up this time.\n\nAs others have said, it's a game about depression. But it's also hard-hitting. It's about being cynical about your own life and dreaming of days when you can become rich, well-off, and set for life. It's also about the feeling of hopelessness that starts when people ask you "where do you see your career or job in a few years?", a feeling that trickles at first but can intensify into a waterfall if you don't smile and ignore it. One of the game's main issues deals with the idea of 'are you happy where you are, and if not - would you bother going to the effort of changing that?'\n\nAnd the game makes a statement about the world we live in: a place where people like to repeat the tired clich√© of "you can do whatever you set your mind to" rather than admit that this is another one of those myths that we accept at face value. I don't believe that every person, who is a few years along into a career or job, who is in their early thirties, will feel as cynical as the game's protagonist....but I have some friends who assure me that the feeling is indeed common. F*cked if I know, but this kind of thinking can only lead down to some dark places. Ones that the game does its best to expose and form a discussion around.\n\nThis game embodies that idea in a well-scripted, concise story. It makes me think that what we fear the most is not living bored with life, alone, paycheck-to-paycheck, but in losing to reality and giving into those feelings of hopelessness.","June 25, 2014","true","2.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

There's comfort in knowing you're not alone, but sadness in the realization that some people will never teeter back to even remotely okay and that there truly is no comfort for some people besides to just end it.  "It gets better" doesn't apply to everyone, no matter how many times we insist it does, no matter how badly we want to fix someone or their situation.

What I find fault with is that this isn't so much an exploration of the topic of depression and its effects, as it is a reveling in its misery and depravity. There isn't much of a point to the game. The player just rides along through a few days of the main character's terrible existence before he's faced with a terrible decision. I think I understand what the designer was attempting to perform with this approach and design, but it's not something that I would recommend for anyone as its just far too dark and hopeless. I would never recommend it for someone who is going through depression as this doesn't present or even explore any possible oulets for recovery or for resolution, except suicide. The main character wallows in his own misery while the player is drug along for the ride, and then he dies.\n\nI didn't enjoy it one bit, and it was miserable. Perhaps that was the designer's intent.

Evan lives a miserable life of boredom and disappointment, he's stuck in a dead-end job and has no friends nor love.

Totally unexpected that the game would play out as it did, however.

Not because of poor gameplay or plot, but because of the content. Actual Sunlight is about dealing with depression in a very realistic manner. Things are not sugarcoated or made to be politically correct. The protagonist isn't someone to sympathise with easily, but at the same time, you, the player, do feel and understand where he is coming from.  The gameplay isn't very difficult as it is mostly clicking and interacting with the items  in our protagonist's daily life, and noting his comments regarding such things. So in a sense, I suppose this will fall under the category of an interactive story. In short, this is an excellent game which tackles a very difficult subject.","December 1, 2014","true","1.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I think. -\n\nOne thing that I'm glad was included in this game was the out-of-control anger scene. I think that people who haven't experienced depression may only think that depression is about feeling sad, hopeless, and having suicidal thoughts. The commercials never say anything about the anger that happens. How it literally takes over your mind and you sometimes can not control the things you say or do when it grabs a hold.

That said, it might not be for those who have conquered or are battling depression. Also, I played Actual Sunlight before its Steam release, but the game on the storefront is identical to the drm-free version, as far as I am aware of.\n\nActual Sunlight features extremely descriptive accounts of the mind of a man named Evan Winter. Through his eyes, you (The Player) will see how Evan sees the world, in all of his frustrating and cathartic perspective. For the short duration of the game, you will large amounts of text that provide some detail about how Evan sees the world. The game features humour that walks the line between Black Humour and the ranting of a broken, dispirited man; the title of the opening monologue ("Why Kill Yourself Today, When You Could Masturbate Tomorrow?") is a good idea of what you can expect.\n\nThe game's dreary tone is reminiscent of Cart Life; it is a game of a sad existence, told through the eyes of a man who is at the end of his tethers. Actual Sunlight leads up to a predictable and yet open-ended climax, and this will be the part of the game that will make you feel most strongly about the entire experience.\n\nActual Sunlight is a game that gives as much as you want to take; this is both its strongest point and its weakness. The game relies on your exploration of the environment to unravel the story of Evan. From his little musings in his apartment to his observations on the world outside, Evan has more or less given in to his depression. While this is effective in letting the player manage how much he or she wants to learn about Evan, you should be aware that you need to click the x button (there's partial controller support) on almost everything. Also, nearly everything in the game is text based, so be prepared to read. A lot.\n\nOn the techincal side. I couldn't get Actual Sunlight to run in fullscreen, so it will probably run in a window with a smaller resolution, just in case you are very particular about the resolution that you play your game at. If anyone has a fix for this please post it in the comments of the review.\n\nTL;DR Actual Sunlight is a fascinating experience, and it will resonate with you if you have had any kind of experience with depression or with people suffering from depression. THAT BEING SAID, DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME IF YOU ARE DEPRESSED, AND THAT YOUR CONDITION MAY BE AFFECTED BY THE TRIGGER WARNINGS IN THIS GAME.\n\n[ url=http://www.polygon.com/features/2013/7/10/4459018/patient-transcript-actual-sunlight] If you would like to learn more about the game, you can read this Polygon interview about the guy who made this game, Will O' Neill.

The meat of the game is in text, observations and essays that are by turns hilarious, heartbreaking, acerbic, and sharply observed. Within the space of a few hours, as the story descends to the very darkest of places, you'll have experienced the full range of human emotion. That's not something you can say about many games.\n\nThis is an important game. It will broaden your perception of what a video game can be. It may well broaden your understanding of the world and the people around you - the quality of the writing is such that you really feel like you're walking in this character's shoes, and experiencing a life that may be very different to yours.\n\nThis all sounds very pretentious, I suppose. That's not something Actual Sunlight revels in. It's different to most games, sure, but it isn't flashily artistic or anything so ostentatious. It's a very honest game.\n\nIt looks great too, with some visually beautiful hand-drawn artwork and original music that dabbles in ambience and takes inspiration from the Toronto hip-hop scene (if you're into that kind of thing).\n\nIf you're even a little bit curious, I couldn't recommend this game more.

It's RPG Maker VX Ace with custom artwork.  We could talk about length.  It clocks in about 20-30 minutes depending on your reading speed.  Gameplay?  Think Gone Home, or Dear Esther.  It's much more about art than it is about needing to fit in the mold of the medium it occurs in.\n\nI think the big thing about this game, though, is message.  It's not a cautionary tale, it's not trying to save its protagonist or give you the opportunity to try and save him, you're not trying to see how many imaginary points you can earn in keeping the unfortunate and unavoidable end from occuring.  This is his life, and this is how it is; a picture of a sad, lonely, fat 30ish year old locked in a downward spiral.  Say what you will about the rest of the presentation, but the writing is great (fortunate because you'll be doing a lot of reading).  Fascinating character study and relatively unique, both in what it tries to do and especially what it is about.\n\nOne additional detail: sometimes games like this are accused of being so un-game-like that they should have just been in another medium, a graphic novel or a film or something, maybe. I think the nature of it being a game, and more importantly a game that offers you false, meaningless choices, is important to the portrayal that Actual Sunlight is trying to achieve. Simply watching it or reading it wouldn't give you the connection to just how meaningless and routine Evan Winter feels that his choices are.","April 8, 2014","true","1.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It only took me 100 minutes to finish this, so keep that in mind when deciding on your purchase, but it's one of the most beautiful and meaningful games I've ever played.\n\nThe visuals are deceptively charming for such a somber game, the writing shifts from beautifully depressing to downright funny, and it's complimented by a nice soundtrack and some great CG illustrations.

I really started to empathize and relate to the character, and I think this would be true even if I didn't have the life I do.\n\nObviously the subject matter is quite sad and hopeless, but the authors own commentary on it is anything but.

I sincerely hope that no one else makes my mistake and don't read the reviews before playing.\n\n*Directly After Completion\ni didnt realize that t he ending was inevitible. i thought the story would be about struggling with depression and eventually making it out, not.... definitely wasnt a good idea for me to play it, becuase i have mdd and due to a mess-up with meds ive been in a bad place for awhile. being in that headspace really messed me up, i cant stop crying\nwhy didnt i read any revieiws\n\n*After I Calmed Down\nFirst of all, I want to say that I understand Evan, I identify with him so freaking strongly that it hurts. It's so hard to overcome, when everything seems hopeless and worthless and everything is screaming that you'd be better off dead- you believe it, because nothing seems to say otherwise. Those thoughts that won't go away, always telling you to give up, that you're nothing, you'll never be anything, you just take up space and time and inconvience people. You can't think of people who love you; you can't think that you can be helped; you can't think that things could ever get better; you can only think of how much it /hurts/, and how much you want it to stop.\n\nBut, I don't understand the purpose of this game, to be honest. There's no saving Evan, there's no message that you should get help if you're suicidal; hell, it says that a therapist won't help you, that nobody will help you. There's nothing that says that this is the reality of a suicidal person, and that's why mental health perception and care need to change, or there's nothing that suggests this is just an insight into someone who's depressed- for all intents and purposes, it paints suicide in a positive light. It says that suicide was really Evan's only option to be happy, that it's everyone's only option.\n\nWith a subject like this, you cannot make suicide a viable option, let alone make it seem like a good one. It is just asking for someone to finally do it. If someone played this while they were suicidal, it's very hard to believe that they wouldn't do it. It's not a bad game, per say, but the content was a mistake- not in how it was presented, as putting people into someone's mind is a very effective way to get something across- but in how it was portrayed, the ending. I've seen talk of romantisizing suicide, and if there ever was an example of that, it would be this game.\n\nIf you don't have depression, and you want a heart-breaking look into what it's like to have it, then sure, play it, If you want.\nIf you are depressed and/or suicidal, or even used to be, do not play this game. It will comprimise your safety; It puts very awful ideas into your head. I couldn't be alone after playing this, in case I did something I would regret, like trying to follow Evan's footsteps.","March 7, 2015","false","1.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

There are no puzzles to speak of rather than rarely figuring out which object or npcs need to be interacted with in which sequence for the story to progress. This game have very few environments, i can think of four off the top of my head, and they are all very small environments. There is no replay value to speak of either. So why am I recommending this, and , I really do, play this game. The quality of the writing is very high, and its very rewarding to find that quite a lot of the environment objects trigger a few screens of biting dialogue to enjoy. I live in Toronto Canada where the game`s protagonist lives which probably helped with immersion quite a lot. So to summarize this is a must play, but only if you feel prepared to read alot, and are comfortable with delving with more serious themes like deterministic fatalism, existiential crisis, the effects of consumerist modernity on mental health, and self worth and self esteem issues in people struggling with depression, It lasts about as long as a movie when you do all the reading so you should factor how much money to invest to acquire this title based on how much entertainment you think that is worth. Also be aware that this is not a solutions-providing game, so if you need that feel good-save-everything-from-being-bad story arc in your entertainment you will be left feeling betrayed","October 10, 2015","true","4.1"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

It's about an hour long and features almost no actual mechanics or choice--as the creator says, its intent is more to paint a portrait of an individual than serve as a traditional game. In that it succeeds.\n\nYou are--or, at least, you're watching--Evan Winter, a late twenty-something corporate deadender whose inexorable spiral into depression and suicide is the focus of the game. Evan's bleak, aphoristic thoughts on the world are sprinkled throughout in memos, monologues, imagined talk show appearance transcripts and conversations with his co-workers. They're a joy to read for anyone who likes dark and clever writing.\n\nFor five bucks, I'm glad I picked this up. It's a very short and human game, and I feel like I know the creator intimately after having gone through it. It's the sort of title that, if a) we were better at describing it all and b) we could convince ourselves to finish anything we start, could come from any member of our strangely disconnected generation who wanted to share their soul.\n\nThat said: If you're nearing thirty years old, have any doubts about where your life's headed or any sort of history with depression or suicide, I would avoid it.

It's very close to the real insight behind the eyes of a depressed person, and this game taught me that I need to do everything in my power to help them out.

But it IS a great work of fiction (or maybe not so fictional?) and THIS is why I will never recommend it to anyone whose mental stability I am not 100% confident in.\n\nThis story is about a simple man, suffering from a severe case of depression, and it is everything you think it could be, and yes, it ends exactly how you sucpect it to end - in a grim, but realistic way. The thing that makes this not so original story great is the bluntness and intimacy it is told with. The author honestly tells in your face a lot of well expressed thoughts you will definitely not like to read without being afraid to call a spade a bloody shovel.\nThe thing that makes this exceptional is that it will most likely cause you, the player, to pick out parts of these thoughts that you truly can relate to (hopefully not all of them), and you involuntarily start to remember all the related stuff from your life, and believe me, it's not the the stuff you want to remember, like, ever.\n\nI am not qualified in psychiatry, so I can not make predictions of how this story can influence a person, who is undergoing a struggle with depression. Will it show you that while it is bad, it is not as bad as it can get if you don't turn for help to somebody? Or will it instead worsen the situation to an extreme extent?\n\nThat is why I will not recommend this game to anyone with such problems, or even the hints of the like. Even if you're just a person with a sensitive emotional state like I am, think thrice before playing it, for it can mess up your day for good.\n\nIf it can cause such feelings though, ain't that a great piece of art?","April 26, 2015","true","2.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I do not remember how, but I did. So I figured it was finally time to dust it off and put it in the virtual CD drive (e.g. load it up on Steam). So I did. And the game was... interesting.\n\nI would not really call this a game at all. It is more of an interactive story. The character in the game is battling a severe case of suicidal depression. The game serves as a window into the character‚Äôs life and thoughts, and gives you the option of continuing his ‚Äúordinary‚Äù daily life. You go to work, you interact with people, you go home. Almost every interaction with an object or person leads to an inner monologue in which the character is recalling some passage he wrote, or a conversation with a therapist, or a television interview. As you progress, the nature of these recollections becomes more and more clear, and you gain further insight into the true mental state of the character.\n\nThroughout the game you are met with the recurring thought of Go up to the roof of the building and jump off. Ordinarily I would not spoil a game in a review, but given the sensitive nature of the ending I believe it best to warn you of what may be coming. That recurring thought becomes more and more prevalent, until it takes over the character‚Äôs thoughts and actions. In the end, your ‚Äúchoices‚Äù are restricted and regardless of what option you take you find the same end. You are on the roof, and the character‚Äôs suicide is implied, but never explicitly stated.\n\nThe graphics in the game are typical of an RPGMaker game. Pixellated sprites and environments run abound. However, the game does interject the occasional hand-drawn scene - these scenes definitely do the game justice, capturing the emotion of each character quite well.\n\nAll in all this is not a game I would recommend to most people. Only pick this up if you are looking for a game that falls into the ‚Äúgames are art‚Äù category, as this serves more as a commentary on what it is like to battle depression.\n\nAnd it serves that purpose well, having hit home on multiple occasions with my own experiences.","May 4","true","1.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

This was primarily from one of the many, many walls of text that constitute this "game".

Either the writer saw a really ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• psychiatrist or he did a bad job of making that stuff up because no half-decent shrink should say those kinds of things.

Throgh the lead characters perspective, the story is painfully accurate and holds nothing back to lift the dreadful tone. Its a strong point to consider that this is an utterly depressing and hopeless narrative, but also give the oppurtunity for depressed players to see another perspective of the illness outside of thier own. I cannot recommend this to those who are suicidal, if you are, please seek help through a trusted friend or relative or the suicide prevention line.

Evan Winters is just your everyday guy, but what makes him special is that theres something of him in everyone of us. The worthlessness and misery that Evan feels every day is something that everyone has felt at least once in their lives. You not only feel for him, you feel what he feels as he goes about his day-to-day life, basking in his miserable and meaningless existence.\nThats what makes this game so special. You feel such a sense of hopelessness and misery, but you just want things to work out for Evan and no matter how much he tells himself or you wish it for him, hes doomed to be stuck in his cycle of misery forever and ever. You as the player just want to help him and pull him out of the darkness, but in reality this isnt a game where you are the brave hero. You aren't some noble protector, saving the people from villainy. You are just a man living out your doomed existence.\nActual Sunlight deals with some really heavy themes relating to depression and suicide, so if you are suffering from one of these issues, I wouldn't reccomend immersing yourself into this world too much.

Most simple actions prompts a black & white script for the player to read, detailing what the protagonist is thinking/recalling.  There is no inventory system, no menus, no stats.  You simply guide the character through the simple, mundane life he has.  The game is short (60 - 90 minutes tops), and very linear.\n\nWhat makes this game such a gem is in the writing itself.  It is a short story that is illustrated in to a game.  The player is given a false sense of control over the character's actions, but soon realizes that the character simply has his own agenda to follow, and will only do as he wants.  I found this to be a clever element to help draw the player in to the character's world of subtle agony and invisible suffering.  The only problem I have is the fact that it is so short and linear.  I would have liked to see more awkward social interactions, and even a tease of hope somewhere.  The story is just a slow downhill slope.\n\nIf you liked other visual novels like To The Moon, but wish it was a bit darker like The Cat Lady, then check this one out.","May 1, 2014","true","1.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

If you consider "To The Moon" with it's simple clicking around and somewhat forced puzzling to be lacking gameplay you will not do any better with "Actual Sunlight" regarding that. It's just a few clicks here and there and zero puzzling.\n\nI guess it's bold to deal with themes of (semi-)isolation, depression and suicide. It clearly bears some autobiographic features that may make one feel like spieing into the life of the guy who made this game. But I suppose there is just no way of convincingly working with such themes without having had own experience with it, or at least without being very close to someone who suffered from it.\n\nThe "message" of this game was not clear to me.

Will O'Neill is a big poop butt who thinks Veno is lame and that's dumb.\n9. Venomancer spits acid. You know, like that alien thing in Alien. You like Alien, right?\n8. The name of your character in Actual Sunlight is Evan Winter. That pales in comparison to Lesale Deathbringer, the Venomancer.\n7. One of Venomancer's core abilities is that he can spawn this little mini-Venomancers who spit poison at you. They are adorable. What the hell is adorable about depression?\n6. Venomancer can solo Roshan. I bet you can't do that.\n5. Just look at his new model. LOOK AT IT http://i.imgur.com/rdPX3li.gif\n4. Venomancer hates Viper. This automagically makes him a good character.\n3. His ultimate is OP as hell.\n2. Veno is voiced by Dave Fennoy, who famously portrayed Lee in The Walking Dead. He was also that dude who said the word "mature" weird on Hulu.\n1. Venomancer looks like a banana and that is cute as ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. http://25.media.tumblr.com/d4e318a8e630b79233eb10dd4da95db8/tumblr_mi1382zIsx1rlbnrdo1_1280.png\n\nSo there you have it.

Being my own individual with my own personality in a society that wants people to conform to the needs of your boss & 9-5 jobs whose contract implicitly states that any grounds the employer deems fit to fire is a legitimate reason. Sometimes its just the state of the industry, structural unemployment or declining economic growth. It seems to me like its an issue of a lack of jobs that gives rise to more temp work as well as politics having a major influence on the business world like the government is preventing many industries from needing to adapt, and expect citizens to do the adapting instead... but thats not my focus here. And yet the game strucks a cord with me. I get the feeling of alienation because we don't need to get to really know people in order to get by in whatever role we choose. On the other side we got domestic lives where our senses are getting overwhelmed by the amount of books to read, media to consume and the limitless potential of sharing thoughts with others on the internet. We can get stuck in endless self reflection and time sinks. For some people the hoplessness that comes from all of that can become overwhelming and for some the hopelessnes can become persistent and realistic given their future prospects. I think if there is a way out of this its to realize before its really too late (suicide) that your not alone and there is always time to learn something new, meet new people and go different places to get a feel for what its like to really live & change how you live, day by day. If you don't then it slowly eats away at you, boiling underneath the surface until you finally decide that life is meaningless and dying is the only way to free yourself from your own prison.\n\n+Thought provoking\n+Minimal but I like the art style, does exactly what it needs to\n-Not very interactive\n-Can be depressing if your in a very similiar situation","February 10","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The main character was both unbelievably boring and unimaginably irritating and I didn't want to spend more time with him.  And that's what makes this game so good, and why you should play it.\n\nIt isn't meant to be fun, or happy.  It isn't meant to leave you with a sense of accomplishment.  This is a game that gives you a virtual experience of what depression can be for some people.   This game is hard to play, and I don't mean in a Dark Souls way, I mean in an emotionally draining, exhausting way.\n\nI'd suggest, if/when you play this game, to consider how the game makes you feel.  The anger and frustration with the character is completely valid.  The boredom is completely valid.  Now imagine that instead of those feelings being directed at a game, it's directed at your life.  That infuriating character with the dialog that drives you crazy is your own internal dialog.  Yep, you absolutely know better than to do the stupid things he keeps doing. Yup, you can see how things are going to unfold from the moment you start playing,and eventually you're rushing though everything just to finish the damn game with the obvious ending. Yup, everything would be better if he would just stop whining for a moment.  But he won't.  Welcome to what depression is for some people.\n\nWhat makes this game so good isn't the gameplay.  It's how much it makes you dislike it that makes it good.  If you have never experienced severe depression, this might give you an idea so you can understand what a friend/family member is experiencing.  If you have experienced it, consider this a window into someone else's experience, so you can see how things are similar and completely different all at the same time.  But most of all, please don't play this game if you aren't safe right now...take care of yourself.  Come back to this when you're in a good place - depression isn't easy at the best of times, and double dipping the depression can't be a good thing.","June 1","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
