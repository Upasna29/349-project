You can check my review on it there (http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/recommended/57740), if you are wondering how Back in Action connect with the previous titles, especially with the most praised and decorated Jagged Alliance 2.\n\nJA Crossfire is not taking us to Arulco. New country, now somewhere in Africa, but the drill remains the same – you are a leader of a mercs group, and you were hired to win a little domestic war, bring peace to the land… Well, but the sounding remained the same as well. For instance, if you hire a merc, he's saying something like "see you in Arulco". The devs certainly not overpaid for transferring parts of Jagged Alliance 2 into their games!\n\nThe map of Arulco in the JA Back in Action was smaller than in the original. The map in JA Crossfire is only half of that we had in the JA BiA… Now you may finish the game on the 2-3 day of the game time, with all towns conquered (reads “liberated” in the western military slang).\n\nIf you take that game as an add-on to Back in Action, in the bundle with “shades of red” and “point blank” DLCs, and with the price under 10 euros (75% discount) – only then it may count as somewhat fair deal. It is a new campaign, alright! Not the JA 3, but a new approach, so long-time-awaited! Still, I set the thumbs down, even agreeing that it’s a decent short game in the rather rare genre. What makes me so upset? Well, the bugs, of course! The moment when developers fix achievements (40% unobtainable now) and make quests in the game just a slightly more logically connected and polished – if that moment will ever comes, I’ll rewrite my review into praising one.\n\nNow, I just can say it is playable, but you don’t need to pay for this beta-release. Arrgh, hate those half-baked-offcuts on Steam, pretending, that they are complete games!\n\nMark 5.5/10","November 12, 2015","false","28.7"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","16","20","0","0"

Once more you are in control of a Mercenary Organisation Killers for Hire :D, select your mercs carefully amongst many available to you, some will work well together others dispite each other so pick them accordingly. You mission (Campaign) if you accept it, is to liberate a country (somewhere in the Middle East) from a tyranic Warlord (terrorist, dictator, a threat to freedom...bla bla bla ), the country is divided into small regions which you have to free successively in order to gain access to the next region. Once liberated, the region will provide you with a monthly income to help you in your war effort...nothing is free...even freedom.\n\nYou can then hire the local mob to protect the freshly liberated region, equiping them with guns, armors and training so they can eventualy repel attacks from the Warlord, in an attempt to recapture it.\nThe concept looks interesting, but the implementations is terrible, game interface not intuitive at all, jerky characters, clunky movements, irresponsive commands (death guaranty during gunfights), dodgy enemy AI they see you coming from miles away even when you don't make any noises, some characters skills have apparently have absolutly no effects, enemies shoot at you from crazy angles in which you can't shoot back and many other annoying things like no way to accelerate time if not in World Map, team lose postions when you tab out of world map, 100 reloads because the game decided to save at stupid time, usualy just before i get crippled with enemy bullets.\nI finished the Game in over 30 hours, completing 90% of the side quests too short and too much frustrations to ever play it again. Shame really cose i kinda liked the concept.\nThe game could have been so much better if devs have taken more care, no patch to fix many bugs.\nAlso many achievements don't work.\nOverall, if you have Jagged Alliance 2 then stick with it, because JA crossfire isn't worth your time.","July 14, 2014","false","36.0"," 20 of 31 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","20","31","0","0"

The key is that you should not compare JA:BiA and JA:C to JA2 at all.\n\nThe game is challenging. I played it at the highest difficulty with tactical mode on. I tend to save a lot (and reload a lot :P). Some people found the game extremely hard. Knowing what you do and frequent (separate) saves help this. Or you can play normal mode with tactical turned off.\n\nThe game indeed has some flows (sometimes path findings is clunky or obstacles in your line of fire can be very disturbing), but all-in-all the game experience for me is great.\n\nIf you like tactical games, and you're not afraid of a challenge this game is for you. Be warned, you better play JA:BiA first to learn the game mechanics (though it has /the same/ tutorial), as I really think this game is harder than the original one. For me it was a welcomed plus. :)\n\nThere are new maps, new mercenaries (others have changes stats), new weapons (other weapons are missing). Now all the mercs are willing to work for you when the game starts, which is also a nice twist.\n\nPeople are complaining that they don't get some achievements. I am afraid that this is true, as I've checked, and I don't have the "Bloody Snow" achievement, though I've retrieved the suitcase full of money (about $40k) Others have been awarded. It is a bit sad as many of the achievements are linked with completion of quests. It would be really just notifying Steam about the achievement completion at the same time as they register the quest competed (which they do all right).\n\nOh, and if you can get the game in a bundle, then don't miss out on it!","July 21, 2014","true","43.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Yes, I read some reviews, looked up some gameplay, but it was more like skimming than detailed examination.\n\nThis is a good game in its own right but it does not deserve carrying a name of legendary Jagged Alliance series.\nJagged Alliance died with "Unfinished Business".\n\nI could recommend this game but not for fans of Jagged Alliance series made by Sir-Tech, if they expect gameplay and other little and subtle things mentioned above, which made those series classic and legendary.","May 15","true","1.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

At the point, where my savegame was stuck on a map where the bots would insta snipe my mercs through walls, I knew I was doomed. It was a bug that would not go away, no matter how often I re-load up the game again. And my last save was like hours ago. So, that bug did not break the game for me, it ended it for me.\n\nThis game ... where should I start? I would love to recommend it, because under the flawed, bugged, miserable game lies a decent strategy game that can be really great to play. I had great moments in my 13 hours of game time. Its a great feeling to plan every details of your assault and then watch it happen and - if you are lucky - succeed.\n\nBut the bright side was just a small part of the game. The major part was frustration, reloading maps and correcting where the A.I. reaches its limits. There are so many downsides to this game that I decided to let it rest. I could overcome the missing merc creation feature. I could overcome the missing depth in the mercs characters. I could overcome the annoying UI. BUT I am sick of reloading a map that I cannot win, due to the fact that the enemy is simply broken. While I need to hit an enemy a dozen times, they tend to one-shot my mercs. They shoot my mercs through massive walls, cars, objects of your choice. They see my mercs through objects.. They shoot mercs they cannot see. One enemy killed my merc by hitting him with his riflestock through a wall. My mercs get killed because they cannot find a way to avoid colliding. If they collide during a firefight, they are goners. They will not find new waypoints to break free. Training milita is annoying, because all you can do is give them weapons you find. The list of flaws feels endless.\n\nIts annoying, nearly every part of this game is broken and annoying. Its like playing versus a bunch of hackers, while your mouse is broken and only half of your keys work. And then, beneath this pile of bugs, cheats, flaws, crap, lies a game that could have been awesome.

Since playing the early versions of jagged alliance I remember many hours of fun and enjoyment. I was similar at first with this game but the game is really really hard to beat. Its not simple and your opponents seem to somehow be much faster or better than you despite the fact you bought the most expensive weapons and armour. And even the best mercs tend to be almost impossible to hire early or middle of the game. I eventually had to forget about it since I was literally stuck and either that or start over.\n\nHowever, after awhile I went online and found out how to actually play this game. I then proceeded to replay the game and I actually started to make money and advance. The key is to use the pause and to direct fire to the enemies torso. Also is the importance of your characters stance. I finnally beat the game and was quite impressed. Also, I realized that there is a previous game to this one called "back in action" which I need to play.","January 8, 2014","true","2.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

My experiance JA started with Back In Action and as I understand it, it differs from the originals greatly. That being said, I really did enjoy Back in Action. JA: Crossfire plays exactly the same as the Back in Action era. It's all about taking over strategic points one at a time, managing resource, hiring militia and etc. There is a fair amount of bugginess to the game such as character response or shots that just don't make sense, but nothing that truely renders the game unplayable. At the time of this review I'm 30+ hours in and I got to say I've enjoyed it. I can't say I think the replay value is high, but it's personally not a game I'll forget about once I'm done with it.\n\nThe biggest issues for me is the price and broken achivements. If you're thinking of playing this, pick it up on sale. The current 20 dollar price tag just isn't worth it. It's a fun game, but I'd only be willing to drop 5-8 bucks on it. The achievements being broken isn't a super big deal to me, but may be the deal breaker for many. I've had one or two unlocked so far, when I should have had far more by now. I've read that some others have had this problem as well.\n\nSo overall, great game if you're into the newer JA series, but be prepared for some bugs here and there.","October 24, 2015","true","34.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
