That being said, Hercules II: The Cretan Bull is a nice little time sink, but if you're not a fan of cutesy, casual, repetitious click-fest games, you'll most likely want to look elsewhere.\n\nPros:\n\n+Accessible, easy to pick-up gameplay\n+Graphics are well done and colorful\n+Simple, intuitive interface\n+No bugs to speak of as yet\n+Cards\n\nCons:\n\n-Repetitive (see intro)\n-HoHum music\n-Action queues are limited to two per worker\n-Only two screen options\n\nAgain, for those looking for depth, steer clear - those just looking to relax without over-exertion, Hercules is as good a distraction as any.

Sadly, it still couldn’t afford to have some form of story.\n\nLong version:12 Labours of Hercules II: The Cretan Bull is the second instalment in a fairly successful line of time management games. Just like its predecessor, this one has no actual story or any real connection to the mythical jobs of Heracles, the title is just an excuse for the pleasant visual theme.\n\nThe core game mechanics are the same as before: you have a set of servants who are used to gather resources in order to remove road blocks to the next level. There are more instances where you need to call upon the help of Hercules himself or one of his mythological friends, but the bulk of the work still falls on the never-tiring servants.\n\nSince a sequel needs some new gameplay elements, there are also a number of changes. Storage space is unlimited, but farms have to be harvested manually, before thieves steal the resources. You now start with at least two servants and most levels offer some form of achievable bonus to boost their efficiency; but you need to be a lot more careful and faster to clear the increased amount of obstacles to reach the bonus time limits.\n\nThe result is a sequel that is a little easier for casual players but a lot harder for those who want to get every award, which is probably the best outcome both sides could hope for.","August 11, 2015","true","10.7"," 34 of 42 people (81%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","81","34","42","5","4"

To be honest, I really wouldn't have picked it up at the full price of $8.99 since this is a very basic flash time waster from what I can see. I find the sale price tag to be just right, try not to buy this for more that $3 or you may regret it. :P\n\nThat being said:\n\nAs I mentioned, this is a  very basic flash time management game with solid artwork. If you've played one you've played them all in my opinion. I'm sure that may sound bad, but it is actually a good thing to know what to expect when you're buying something. One of the things I really like is that it has achievments as well as trading cards!\n\nAs far as replay value goes, I'd give this about a medium rating in that regard. I don't think I'll beat it over and over but it has the 'dust off' potential that I mention in my other reviews: You beat the game, shelve it, then dust it off when you're bored months later. Not bad. Most of these just get a once through from me but I think I'll be trying this on the different dificulties once I beat the main story.","June 6, 2015","true","0.7"," 39 of 51 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","39","51","2","0"

I have not enountered any bugs. The game is very fun, it is a time management, resource gathering game in which you play a story involving Hercules, his servants, and mythological creatures such as the Medusa, Minotaur, Cerberus and others. The aim of the game is to do differnt objectives in everyone of the beautifully designed 44 levels, which involve constructing buildings, clearing roads of obstructions, gathering resources and other special objectives. I really enjoyed this game, it has beautiful graphics, beautiful soundtrack and a nice story. It was very relaxing and I really enjoyed how cute it is with all the character designs, and nice and peaceful. And I only bought it for less than 1 euro at the release sale. Since I bought it I could barely stop playing.

Servants run for me."\nThe 12 Labours of Hercules II: The Cretan Bull is part 2/4 of a newly on Steam introduced series of casual time-management flashgames. It has cute and colorful 2.5D graphics and a lovely entertaining soundtrack (one song really sounds like Greek). Placed in the ancient Greek mythology you accomplish many tasks in 40 challenging levels and fight four different bosses. You will also buildup four ancient marvels during the level proccess.\n\nWell part two has the SAME soundtrack. In gameplay now thieves steal your resources and you can buildup outposts. Also different obelisks give you perma powerups. Most annoying is flying goddess Hera scaring away your servants. Otherwise the gameplay has not changed remarkable and the graphics quality is still the same. So for a sequel what did they change entirely? Mostly more business. Your servants must run for everthing. More resources, more jobs in faster time. Now ancient marvels are a zoo and an amusement park. Strange how fast they gave up this ancient topic into ridiculous (rubber ducks in lava). They added some puzzle games and bonus levels. But the best is one achievement to beat 10 times a dev's record on expert mode. Hmm, then I thought to playthrough the whole game on expert ...","October 20, 2015","true","6.1"," 25 of 35 people (71%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","71","25","35","7","2"

The Cretan Bull has been frightened by Hera and is destroying everything. It's up to Hercules (and his workers) to tame it to save the day!\n\nThe concept is still the same: gathering ressources to build farms, workshops or gold mines, to keep gathering ressources and to reach the goal of the level. Now Hercules is no more sleeping but he's rather waiting until you can send him do some works: moving rocks mainly. And don't forget the bonuses that will help you if you're trying to beat the Olympic Time in Basic and Expert modes (the Relaxed mode doesn't hold a time and as such, doesn't count points for a score).\n\nThe main novelty is the appearance of a warehouse: sparring some time and distance between a far away ressource and the main house. It's also expanding the limit of your inventory. Also, you can get annoyed by Hera or Birds that can scare your worker, you have poles that can build in honor of the gods and help you, robbers are taking your ressources from farms, workshops or gold mines if you're not fast enough to collect them and Charon can go take ressources you can't reach for 1 piece of gold.\n\nIn other words, the gameplay, while still the same, has been spiced up. And add the quest to find every piece of a puzzle during the level to unlock a bonus level.... or to beat a "developer's score".\n\nIf you loved the first game, you'll love this sequel. And given the fact that the game isn't hard, everyone can play it.

Don't expect to flex your brain muscle on this one unless you wish to get gold on all expert mode maps.  This is a click fest and nothing more.  However, it is still an entertaining one.  I did like the improvements over the first version.  This time you have to pick up all of the resources, rather than them automatically being added to your coffers.

This time, farm and workshop resources are not automatically collected, so you have to keep an eye on their timer. There are also thieves present to steal your resources if you do not supervise them in time. Some shrines have been added to the game to give your workers some bonuses, alongside a little HOG sequence consisting of puzzle pieces to collect in each level to unlock some bonus levels. Aside these little differences, it is the same game.\n\nThe game uses the same mechanics as the first one, and basicaly contains the same automated actions. The same game, polished, added features and presented to us for more time to kill. Someone mentioned a story there, right? Still consists of thrown around mythological figures with no to little relevant story. Oh, and our villain has changed from Hades to Hera.

Hera has released a wild Cretan bull and it's up to Hercules and his workers to overcome various obstacles and find this bull and tame it.\n\nAs in the previous game, you command your workers to collect resources such as wood, food, and gold, construct buildings and roads, and so forth.  In addition now, though, each level has a puzzle piece to find and if you find all of the puzzle pieces, you can put them together to form pictures.  Then, they will unlock bonus levels which you can play for additional fun.  The levels are the same as before and there are the mini-games, just like in the previous game.  Also, there are both Steam achievements and trading cards so there's definitely incentive to play this game.  This time, there are 3 difficulty levels, as opposed to 2 from the last game.  There's relaxed, casual, and expert so you can choose which difficulty suits you best.\n\nOverall, I found this sequel to be more challenging than the first one although just as fun.

A casual path for gamers that like to relax playing easy games in their free time. Or a challeging one which will prove to be a very big challenge for all the achievement hunters from around the world, as they have think rapidly, beat time scores and have fun at the same time.\n\nThe concept is still the same as the first game of the series. A time management game in which you have to gather resources to help you build farms, workshops or gold mines. Which after, it will help you gathering more and more resources to reach the goal of the level. The funny part is that now Hercules doesn't sleep anymore but he's rather waiting there until you can send him to work, like moving rocks in the most part.\n\nThe second installment from the series prepares for the fans of the game some new features like new scenarios, 22 new achievements to beat, 40 more levels to play through, original minigames to keep you pumped, a new type of enemies and the ability to beat a score made by the very own developers of the game. But not only that, this time Hercules must confront against the goddess Hera, who has been set up as the new villain. Hera has released a wild Cretan Bull into the world and it's up to our hero and his workers to overpower various obstacles, find this bull and tame it.\n\n\nPros- Support for Achievements, Trading Cards and Steam Cloud.\n- Hidden puzzle pieces around each mission for collectors to find, which later on will let you play a bonus level.\n- Plenty of achievements to keep you determined in completing the game.\n- Addictive gameplay that won't let you get bored. 12 Labours of Hercules II it's an fun game that will make you play through it a few times.\n- Relaxing sounds that will keep you company while your servants are gathering resources.\n- The artwork from the game is greatly satisfying as it's friendly with all the ages.\n- The game doesn't have any actual bugs in it.\n- Simple and intuitive interface that will help you get into the game faster.\n\nCons- Same music as the first game of the series.\n- No to little relevant story.\n\nConclusionThe decision you need to do is pretty simple.

This time you have to pick up all of the resources, rather than them automatically being added to your coffers.

Slightly diversified (with new game play features, bonuses and surprises) to make each game a bit different, while keeping enough in common with the previouse one(s), which shortens waste of time and nerve on mastering the next game, that's valuable. Repetative, yet it feels all right here, can't remember myself being driven into bore even once. I beat all four games 100% on expert difficulty and still wouldn't mind to see the fifth. Taken into account the fact that games like these are not my idea of fun (or they weren't at least))) - what better recommendation could i give to a game. If you are looking for a highly involving and entertaining, not all that hard yet challenging enough game - check this one. Probably you will be pleased even beyond your expectations.\n---------------\nСерия из четырех одинаково отличных и очень качественно(во всех отношениях) сделанных игр- тайм менеджеров. Слегка отличающихся друг от друга (по набору игровых аспектов, бонусов и сюрпризов), ровно настолько чтобы не быть совсем однообразными, и при этом не вынуждать учиться играть заново, что несколько сокращает затраты времени и нервов на освоение каждой следующей игры, что порадовало. В принципе они достаточно однообразны, но здесь это не кажется недостатком, не помню ни разу чтобы это как то обломало интерес к игре.  Полностью прошел все четыре на экспертной сложности и не отказался бы от пятой. С учетом того, что сами игры далеко не из списка моих предпочтений (по крайней мере не были))), вряд ли я придумаю способ высказаться об игре в еще более позитивном духе.\nВ общем, если вы подыскиваете что-нибудь достаточно увлекательно-развлекательное, при этом не слишком сложное, но тем не менее бросающее определенный вызов вашим способностям в пределах разумных затрат времени и сил - то это как раз то что надо. Вполне возможно порадует даже сверх ожиданий.","February 22","true","45.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The Cretan Bull plays almost exactly like the first game and judging it as a standalone game, it is relatively fun, especially for the price that it is at.\n\nHowever, on the otherside, this is a second game in the series and there was no real significant improvement or added conent from the first game. They polished up stars a bit and added in some extra things like thieves and random Heras, but the gameplay and everything is pretty much exactly like the first game. They even recycled the music and some of the levels seem awfully familiar as well. Basically the Cretan Bull is more like extra levels from the first game rather than a different game.\n\nRegardless of the cons, if you want to play this game as a standalone with no frame of reference, by all means play it. The game is cheap, nice, and short.\n\nRating: 7.1/10\nRecommend: $1 or less","May 14","true","4.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","0"

Previous installment: 12 Labours of Hercules.\n\nNote: There is a storyline for the game but it isn't much to it nor its' rememberable. Gameplay formula is pretty much the same as the first one.\n\nThis is a time management game, where careful planning is required, limited amount of resources that are available throughout the game; henced the word management.\n\nThis game has the total of four episodes with 11 levels each; totaling out 44 levels altogether. There twenty-two different achievements but each of them come with a requirement.  There are also puzzle pieces to find throughout the game. The four bonus levels can be unlock when the jigsaw puzzle is completed.\n\nThere are three modes, relaxed; casual and expert, the difference between them is the timer speed and scoring. In relaxed mode, no timer and no scoring. In casual mode, the timer drain a slowly and the scoring is moderately low. In expert mode, the timer drain much quicker and the scoring is much higher.\n\nThe stars that are earned from completing the level depends upon on how much time is left on the timer. This only applies to the causal and expert modes\n\nThree Gold star is when the time has not gone pass the arrow. Two Silver star is when the time has gone pass the arrow. One Bronze star is when the timer is completely empty.\n\nReplaying any of the levels will improve the game score and the amount star.\n\nThere are few special bonuses: Freeze Time, Worker Movement/Work Speed, Additional Worker and Increases Resources. All of these special bonuses has a certain time limit but they can be used again once the bar fills-up. These special bonuses are very useful when the game is being played on expert mode.\n\nI don't think that this game much of replay value to it. If you're into time management games then you might find this game somewhat enjoyable to certain extent.\n\n\nReviews for other games of this series:\n12 Labours of Hercules\n12 Labours of Hercules III: Girl Power","July 5, 2015","true","22.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

Surprisingly, it's actually a really fun RTS-style game.  It's a lot simpler than other RTS-style games (only uses mouse so you don't have to worry about needing to have a crazy APM in order to beat the game or have fun).  It's relatively simple to understand, and the game is hard to put down once you get past the first few levels.\n\nThere's 40+ levels in this game (not entirely sure how many, but definitely 8-10+ hours worth of solid gameplay), and each of them build on the previous in terms of complexity/difficulty.  As of right now I'm a little more than halfway done with the game, and I haven't had any problem whatsoever getting 3/3 stars on every level so far on medium difficulty.  If you're one to play only on the highest difficulties, then you'll definitely get challenged.  Relaxed (the easiest diffuculty)  isn't so boringly easy either, so I think this game is able to appeal to a lot wider audience.\n\nWhile this game definitely isn't trying to be one of the harder/more complex RTSes out there, I think it's perfectly fine for what it does.  Pick this game up if you have any doubts, it's easily one of the best game for its price.","December 23, 2015","true","8.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I played and beat the first one couple hours ago and continue the game to second series. I don't really familiar with time management game but I realized something, this is might be my favorite genre, thanks to this series\n\nPro:\n- Great music (same as 1st one)\n- Great assets (same as 1st one), new backgrounds\n- simplified UI and more clicking as they add thief system into game, I think this would be great on mobile, because first one wasn't good on mobile in my opinion\n- new puzzle piece, the objects are hidden very well.\n- so our hero doesn't sleep all time and let his "slave" does the work this time,\n\nCon:\n- boring boss level =D\n\nthis game feels more fast paced than first one because of thief and hades, the gameplay is slightly different because passive resource became active and your finger would keep clicking the task :D","November 19, 2015","true","15.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It focus's on Hercules 7th labor of penance according to the real myth which was to kill a cretan bull that was going around terrorising Crete. In the real myth Hercules stangles it with his bare hands. In game i think he gets it to roll over and gives it a belly rub or something. Must confess I wasn't paying much attention to the story.\n\nThe mechanics of this one if fairly much the same as the previous. The only exception being that a puzzle piece is hidden on each map for you to find. Which when you find them all will unlock four more levels.\n\n44 Levels, 4 of which involve some sort of boss fight or minigame. These minigames are easy to get a perfect achievement on in comparison to how infuriating they were in the previous one. However this does not mean that achievement hunters like myself will not come across some aggrevating predicaments.\n\nIf you are an achievement hunter then i STRONGLY suggest the following. Place the difficulty on the easiest setting. Complete five maps and find the puzzle piece in that map. Do not log out when you have found the puzzle piece as you MUST complete the map you are on. Once you have the 5 puzzle piece achievement, turn the difficulty of the maps up and start earning three stars on all the maps. Remember you have to get all achievements on one profile. Hopefully that will save you from doing two or three walkthroughs of this game like I had to.\n\nLast thing worth mentioning is the fact that they have added a Developers record time which you must pass at least ten times. This is actually quite challenging and makes a good addition for the game. In a nutshell a fun game to pass some time on if your looking for something that will have you in a click frenzy. With all the running around the servants do while wearing short toga's, all I've got to say is this 'thank God they wore underwear back then'.","January 17","true","20.6"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Hera's Cretan Bull is on a rampage, and it's up to Hercules and his servant to put a stop to its destruction and tame the beast.\n\nPros: Much like the previous game, Hercules orders his servant around in single-screen puzzles, where you must reach a variety your objectives by picking up resources and accomplishing tasks that consumes those same resources, tasks such as fixing the path or upgrading buildings, all within a set time limit. Every once-in-a-while, you'll need to enroll the help of allies from the previous games, such as as the Medusa, the Pegasus, the Cyclops and the Cerberus, in order to defeat certain obstacles. You must also fend off thieves who will steam your resources if you don't collect them quickly enough, while Hero appear every so often to scare your servants from doing their work.\n\nCons: The game is basically additional levels from the previous one, with little innovation. There are no new resources, and you barely ever get to use the Lion, the only new ally that joins you in this game. The graphics are exactly the same as the previous one with no apparant advance or additional investment from the artist. The world overlay has much less to do with anciant Greece, and the landmarks you build from getting a Gold Victory in levels are actually modern-looking zoos or resorts. The story is even poorer, and seems more like an excuse to make rimes.\n\nVerdict: ★★★☆☆ - It's up to you\n\nThe game feels even more targeted for a younger audience than the previous 12 Labours of Hercules, but I've come to assume that it is on purpose considering the low difficulty and extremely childish tale. If you're looking for challenging puzzles, stay away. But if you're looking a child's game to develop hand-eye coordination of mouse dexterity, this might just be what you're looking for.\n\n—————————————————————————\nThis was just my opinion.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.","January 22","true","11.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I would not tell anyone to their face that I think they would enjoy it. It boils down to clicking all over the screen like mad, and then getting gold when it's done. It is however, a bit addicting, and easy to pass the time with. It can be satisfying to clear out everything on the screen and collect the resources. The graphics, music, plot, ect. is all dumb.\n\nThis game is basically shiny lights that go off, and you have to click on them to collect the shiny lights. Collecting shiny lights unlocks more shiny lights! After getting so many shinies, you may click the disco ball in the middle, and hooray! You win!\n\nIf you happen to drop a dime, and the developer picks it up, and mistakes it to mean you're buying this game from him, and gives it to you, then go ahead and play this game. I would recommend it then. But to actually buy it? No, I think not.","October 26, 2015","false","9.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

This one, they went the way of the Star Wars prequels: Let's just throw more crap on the screen and call it better.  The result is you have to click constantly.  Any strategy is now lost in a sea of clicks.\n\nYou have to go and collect food and wood from farms and woodshops.  Servants move faster to compensate, but you now have 3/4 servants doing nothing but servicing different farms and woodshops.  And you still have a queue depth of 3, so you will have idle servants because you simply can't click fast enough.\n\nThey also added nonsense distractions like Hera flying down and scaring your workers (click Hera to make her go away).\n\nFirst one was 7/10 for me.  This one I couldn't even make it past the first act before I was overwhelmed with boredom.  4/10.","December 13, 2015","false","5.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

It's a cute game with some good thought behind it. Very attractive graphics, simple interface, nice background music and some fairly complex puzzles that must be solved on a timer. This is not something that is going to keep you occupied for hours at a time. I finished off the first four puzzles in something like 15 minutes. If there are indeed 12 labors to complete, you're looking at maybe an hour or perhaps a bit more to complete. There isn't much of a story to follow (Hercules lost his bull and has to solve some puzzles to get it back) and the game is quite suitable for players of almost any age. Since it's all about acquiring resources in order to complete tasks in the shortest amount of time, it's got some decent replayability in trying to beat your previous time.

It's not particularly difficult.  But not every game is legendary or epic; some are just a lighthearted way to kill ten minutes or so at a time.  "The Cretan Bull" is definitely one of the latter.  It's easy to pick up; easy to put down.  Six months after completing it, you'll probably have forgotten it about it entirely.   But it's modestly fun, and so far as my experience went, bug-free.

Would rather not replay all the same levels again just to beat hard. Given the short time it took me, worth it at sale price (2 euros) but definitely wouldn't pay full (10 euros).\n\nP.s.

They added "thieves" into the game which makes it necessary for you to further micromanage the game as they'll steal your resources and force you to wait to respawn.

It's a cute game with some good thought behind it. Very attractive graphics, simple interface, nice background music and some fairly complex puzzles that must be solved on a timer. This is not something that is going to keep you occupied for hours at a time. I finished off the first four puzzles in something like 15 minutes. If there are indeed 12 labors to complete, you're looking at maybe an hour or perhaps a bit more to complete. There isn't much of a story to follow (Hercules lost his bull and has to solve some puzzles to get it back) and the game is quite suitable for players of almost any age. Since it's all about acquiring resources in order to complete tasks in the shortest amount of time, it's got some decent replayability in trying to beat your previous time. A good job all around and well worth adding to your library, especially if you can catch it on sale.","June 11, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Heck, I'd have been happy paying as many as $3 for this game!!!\n\nSeriously, 12 Labours is a silly little resource management game.  Essentially, it's like doing base management in an RTS game (Starcraft, Age of Empires, etc.), but without the whole "going to war" part.  You give orders to servents to farm, gather resources, clear obstacles, etc., and then try to hit the goals of the map before the timer expires.\n\nIt's not a deep game by any stretch, but it's fun enough.  Their isn't much plot, but the game does have a good sense of humor.  And if you decide that you really like it, there are a number of easter eggs to unlock... if you want to put in the time and effort.\n\nPersonally, I was happy to play through each of the maps just once; but like I said, that got me a few hours of enjoyment.

Not sure if I like the new mechanic of having to pick up your resources (and the thief mechanic) it's annoying as all hell but does give an extra layer of challange, so guess it depends what you like. The extra obelisks were a nice touch and highly useful. They did make your hero powers a lot more useful, some level absolutely needing them to win. The developers times were bloody insane. Overlord achievement is wrong however. You only need 5. 1.1, 1.3,1.10, 2.10,3.1, 3.10 and 4.10 are you best bets for that one. Just a hint there for you achievement seekers.

This is the type of game that I'd play during a study break, or while I'm waiting for a plane. It asks for very little from you in terms of brain capacity or effort, and offers a pleasing, casual adventure in return.\n\nThe gameplay consists of you the player directing multiple workers to remove obstacles, collect resources, and construct buildings for additional resources in order to complete the level's goal. You control your workers by simply clicking on the tiles where you would like for them to go. Strategery comes into play when considering which resources to collect first, when to build farms and workshops for additional resources, and when to activate other abilities to increase the productivity of your workers. This is most likely a game that will only take a couple levels to get used to (No more than 15 minutes), and the only control you need to know is the click of your mouse!\n\nI got the most out of my experience when I decided to strategize before each level and optimized my pathing. Believe when I say that there is a best way to complete a level, and if you want to beat any developers scores you will have to put in the extra effort.\n\nThe negatives regarding this game don't have anything to do with the core gameplay (for the most part). The story is incredibly bareboned and the musical score is pretty forgettable (I turned it off after a few levels). The only problem with the gameplay was level 3.8, in which I discovered a game breaking issue that took me a few minutes spooling through forums to resolve. You can only hold 99 of a resource at a time, and this is a level where it is very easy to collect more than 99, meaning you can collect resources from the map without gaining resources in your inventory, so choose your routing carefully!\n\nIn conclusion, for the 99 cents I paid, there's not much complaining I can do. It gave me a solid 9 hours of easy gaming, it was nice to look at, and there is some replay to be had if you want to collect hidden puzzle pieces in the levels, tackle harder difficulties, or maximize your scores, not to mention achievements and trading cards.","June 18, 2015","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are a few achievement changes, including a more difficult one, Overlord but it can also be easy to get a perfect game in. This one also adds a "thief" element that can steal your supplies. While I find it adds a fascinating aspect to the strategy of the game, it can also be infuriating at times and puts on emphasis on having to rush things. This makes the game a bit of a less "casual" strategy compared to the first since you are on even more of a "time crunch." It's still enjoyable and a fun little gem.\n\nPros:\n-More strategy aspects\n-New "puzzle" aspect\n-Variety of new elements, including thieves\n-Fairly easy achievements\n-Same great art, music, gameplay\n\nCons:\n-Looped music\n-Theives stealing my shiz (T.T)\n-Feels a tad short still (but I like the additional levels!)\n\nMehs:\n-Overlord achievement was a tad of pain but it was still feesible\n\nOverall: 9.75/10","February 22","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Hercules is said to be the demigod son of Zeus, who completed the legendary Twelve Labors, only to be betrayed by Hera who drove him insane and caused him to murder his wife Megara and their children during a visit to King Eurystheus. Throughout the film, it is not clearly established that Hercules is truly the son of Zeus, and many are skeptical of the claim as well as of the stories of Hercules' famous Twelve Labors. Despite this, Hercules is frequently seen displaying unusual strength and nigh-unmatched skill in combat. Hercules is frequently haunted by the memory of the deaths of his wife and daughters by his hand, as well as visions of Cerberus.\n\n11/10 would play it again","December 25, 2015","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you don't care about speed and want to just take your time (like I did) then you can play on the relaxed mode.\n\nThe biggest problems I've found with the game was that it got boring very quickly, being almost a chore to complete more than 2 missions in one sitting, there is around 6 hours of gameplay, more if your looking to complete all the achievements. Along with completing just the main objectives, you can look for puzzle pieces hidden inside each level.\n\nIt's a decent game, I would not get it full price, but if you can grab it for cheap in a sale, give it a try.\n\nPayed $0.20 and made my money back alone from the cards.","February 21","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are a few achievement changes, including a more difficult one, Overlord but it can also be easy to get a perfect game in. This one also adds a "thief" element that can steal your supplies. While I find it adds a fascinating aspect to the strategy of the game, it can also be infuriating at times and puts on emphasis on having to rush things. This makes the game a bit of a less "casual" strategy compared to the first since you are on even more of a "time crunch." It's still enjoyable and a fun little gem.\n\nPros:\n-More strategy aspects\n-New "puzzle" aspect\n-Variety of new elements, including thieves\n-Fairly easy achievements\n-Same great art, music, gameplay\n\nCons:\n-Looped music\n-Theives stealing my shiz (T.T)\n-Feels a tad short still (but I like the additional levels!)\n\nMehs:\n-Overlord achievement was a tad of pain but it was still feesible\n\nOverall: 9.75/10","February 22","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Had more of the same and new interesting stages like managing plebs, fighting off thieves and mining gold. Plenty of time and resources to achieve gold time.

What else? Well, personally I got in on sale for 50 cents - quite the deal! Has trading cards, achievements. The music is good - by that I mean it's not irritating and I actually enjoyed it. Each character does something unique. They are all well-drawn. A lot of levels to complete. Each level is different. Mini-games too. They are short but fun. Extra levels which are usually long-ish. Fun to play.\nTakes a while to 100% but it's not impossible. There's an achievement that some people find a bit hard - "Overlord" (beat dev's time 10 times.) Now, it's actually 5 times. I did that on 1.1 - Expert | 1.7 - Expert | 1.10 - Expert | 2.10 - Expert | 3.1 - Casual. 3.10 and 4.10 also can done or at least someone said so. My point is don't let that stop you from buying the game. I am saying that mostly to other achievement hunters. :D I was hesitating should I buy it or not exactly because of that. It's worth it if you can get it on sale. Pro tip: Never pay full price for a game on Steam. At least that's what I usually do, lol.\nAfter seeing how good "12 Labours of Hercules II" actually is, I consider buying the other 3 games as well. Will wait for a sale, but I am really looking forward to that. I noticed they are 100%-able too so what are you waiting for? Go buy them now. :D","May 19","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
