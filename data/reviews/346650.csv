Wait for it to be on sale for.. well.. for Free.\n\nI have never once regreted buying anything on steam ever, but this game i regret.\nI can't be bothered with spelling and grammar so i'll just list things, eaiser to get the point across.\n\nI had to double check that this wasn't in early access because it just doesn't feel like a game, especially one that warrants £3.00+ for.\n\nIt feels like a game made from one of them poor youtube tutorial videos, there is litterally nothing to it. I've dabbled with unity and what i've seen of the game so far you could make it in a day or weekend, totally not worth the money.\n\nCons:\n-No options menus at all, no sound, graphics or controls menus nothing. Only 2 buttons "New game" and "Exit".\n-It is NOT and i repeat NOT! a fast paced game from what i've played, you don't get timed at all, so it appears you can play a level for 10 hours and still complete it.\n-The feel of player position to the camera seemed offset, i was constantly missing jumps, even basic level 1 jumps.\n-Game uses "Tricks" to win, identical looking level complete doorways with no visual difference and if you enter the wrong one you lose. So think of the "Impossible Quiz" where you would trial and error the game.\n-Other than tricks the levels don't hold any difficulty with no timer, you walk from 'A to B' and don't fall down, some blocks might fall from beneath you but they seem different coloured so just avoid them if you need to stop.\n-No Graphics options, Sound options, control options, mouse sensativity options nothing.\n-It has the caption "Speedrun" but you don't even need to run.\n\nHeres the big one. They included what looks like a DRM free version of the game inside the steam installer that is supposed to be used if the game crashes on start up. WHICH IT DOES. The game crashes on start up, this is not early access but a full release.\n\nPros:\n-It is a game, if you like running to the end of different corridors buy it and play it. I can't think of anything other than that.\n\nConclusion:\nYes i may be negative, but it is a simple game that anyone who has a remote clue of Unity or UDK could make. There is nothing that pushes the boundaries of gaming involved, you could play doodlej**p and or flappythingy and get as much difficulty or more out of them.\n\nTo be honest,  i don't know what i expected when i bought the game. But unless you have a passion for this sort of game or if you have more money than sense. Don't get this game, you will play if for maybe 10mins and probably never touch it again.\n\nI have not spell checked or grammar checked.","January 27, 2015","false","0.1"," 47 of 62 people (76%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","76","47","62","4","0"

It's also stupid.\n\nYou don't have any checkpointing or saving system, so although you can probably get through the first terrible level in a couple of tries, the 2nd level will probably be a little tougher to get through, but each time you fail on the 2nd level you have to repeat the 1st level.  That also means listening to a sound clip of R.Kelly's "I believe I can fly" every time you need to make the jump at the end.  Be prepared to hear that sound clip a lot, because the 3rd level is tough, and you will have to repeat that first level almost every few seconds.\n\nThere's no models, textures, or anything else.  Just platforms that slowly move and try to make you fall, so you can go repeat all the prior levels, without any reward.\n\nThere's also another sound clip, I assume it is the developer's voice saying "you win".  It's a rather crude sound clip, probably his first take, and it wouldn't surprise me if it was recorded on a cell phone from the mid 90's.  You get to hear this sound clip when you reach the end of the level, even if the next level is virtually identical to the one prior to it.\n\nNot to mention the non-installer issues where you actually have to manually install the game into the Steam folder.  Or how it says "SpeedRun" in the game's blurb but speed in this game will get you killed instantly, and you have to hear R.Kelly again.  Actually, not hearing the R.Kelly sound clip is the reward of beating a level, if there is one.\n\nIsn't that copyrighted, too?\n\nTL;DR:\n\n- If you are looking for a half decent game for under $5, look over the "games under $5" section on Steam:\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/search/?filter=ut2\n\nIf something catches your eye and that game's title is NOT "Break the Cube", I would strongly suggest getting that instead.","January 28, 2015","false","0.5"," 23 of 39 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","23","39","0","1"
