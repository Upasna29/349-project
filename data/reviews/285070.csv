I will add a TL;DR at the end.\n\nGameplay\nThe game in itself is fairly simple and ends up dealing with some very heavy themes. In the game you wander across three different parts of the main character's life as you experience his own trip into a sense of madness and paranoia. In your inventory you can hold six items at once while you run around and try to do certain tasks to advance within the game. Sometimes the item could be right in front of you and you could be searching for a long time to find that one item to advance. The story showcases bullying, fear of the dark, and isolation as you explore with the main character. The only thing thing that helps seems to be his videogames, a way to escape his reality. The controls are fairly simple however with controller it would be nice to have the option to switch a button or two.\n\nGraphics/Sounds\nThe artstyle of this game is unique and matches the game really well. Especially how the game is depicted when you are in the Otherworld (the video game). The different monsters and the shadows are interesting to say the least. The music in this game is greatly atmospheric adding to the game’s heavy themes to increase the sense of madness, isolation, and paranoia.\n\nPros/Cons\nPros\n\n+ Artstyle is beautiful\n+ Heavy themes portrayed perfectly to make you see the character’s struggles\n+ Good music and sound effects\n+ Good story\n\nCons\n\n- Bad save system (saves every chapter, but without looking for help some are long and it is annoying if you have to quit and then restart again from a chapter. Once you figure out the level this is not really an issue. )\n- Little replayability unless for achievements\n\nSuggestions\nThese are my personal suggestions that I feel would improve the game.\n\n- Checkpoint system within chapters\n- Ability to change controls\n- An option to enable an objective hint giver after being stuck for X amount of time (not to reveal where something is but maybe something like “Am I sure I checked the garage?”)\n\nFinal Thoughts\nI was able to enjoy the game very much as I played through it. The art and music are both great and I enjoy games that try to encompass the ideas of madness, fear, isolation, and actually succeed. As much as I enjoy the game however, I don’t like the save system. The save system in my opinion is annoying, especially for someone like me who wants to know when something is saved or likes to always save frantically. The breaks between saves is annoying when I play with no guide, figure every little thing out, then have no option to save as I have to leave the game for the night. Overall I would say Between Me and The Night is a very wellmade and polished game with its story, themes, and visuals making it a good title.\n\nTL;DR\nBetween Me and The Night has its bumps such as its save system, however the game is a well made title that is able to thoroughly deal with heavy subjects and the thin line of madness people walk. Overall Between Me and The Night has a good story, art, music and is an all around good title to play if you like this type of game or are interested in the themes prevalent within it.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","February 15","true","6.8"," 28 of 33 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","28","33","0","2"

It's like judging a child before they have had the chance to grow up and reach their full potential. The opportunities are there, the art design, tone, and gameplay are showing promise. On the other hand Between Me and The Night has some serious issues that need addressing. Mostly the game just lacks any content. You can blow through the content of the game in about 20 minutes. While those 20 minutes are filled with some neat ideas such as twisting the genre into a retro game one second and the next an action game. Glaring issues like lack of music, narrative, direction, and bugs really show the kinks in the titles armor. Of course this is all due to the game still being in-development. Taking a bite out of a barely baked cake is going to leave you with a wet mess, does that mean the cakes bad? No. It just needs more time in the oven. This is what Early Access is all about, developing your game with your community. That being said for whats available as of the posting this preview. The price doesn't reflect the gameplay. You are buying this to SUPPORT THE DEVELOPER. I can't underline that enough. I like what I see, I just want to see WAY more of it. I am the type of guy who can see the glass is half full but saying the opposite isn't exactly a lie either. I just hope and believe that the developers will pull this strange, mysterious, title together and mess with our minds just like those 20 minutes did.\n\nI made a video preview to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\nhttps://youtu.be/xS2Ort-bzZA\nI hope you enjoy!\nMartyr","October 10, 2015","true","1.1"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","21","24","0","0"

Upon completion, the young, red-headed boy is then jarred awake by -- what I would assume to be -- the shrill sound of his mother’s voice beckoning him for breakfast.  The game takes place in the life of this boy, whose love for video games seems to be the only escape from his menial living. His passion for games surpasses that of reality as the two intertwine, the boy’s story is being told through grotesque silhouettes of his family and friends through his vivid imagination.\n\nPlayers interact with surrounding objects with some viewed as useless and taking up space, while others are objective items necessary in progressing through each chapter; even then, the protagonist is only allowed to carry six items at a time. The visuals are simplistic and daunting, painting a haunting depiction of the boy’s distressed life with few to almost no narrative text or sound. However, despite the easiness of the game, some may experience a variety of glitches throughout and may be due to the fact that Between Me and The Night is an Early Access game that still needs to go through some patches.\n\nSad to say, even though I’ve been playing the game for five hours, I could not beat it because of the glitches that kept surfacing for me. For instance, when I had no available space for a current objective item, I would drop an item key item on purpose or by accident and it would just disappear, rendering my playthrough pointless. At that point, countless restarts were necessary, starting back from the beginning of each chapter since there is no saving access points. Even with those issues, another one arises! It caused immense frustration. While exploring the protagonist’s high school life, the player comes across what resembles a Gameboy Color. Before playing it, you’re required to retrieve the charger and a game cartridge. After doing so, you engage in a mini-game resembling a dungeon, exploration platformer. Once the level is beaten, however, you’re met with the inevitable, “Stage Cleared!” No amount of button mashing will let me escape that screen and progress into his college year, which adds onto the underlying frustration from the glitching because it’s supposed to continue the story after this.\n\nI really do not want to have to say “Don’t recommend” because the game definitely has a lot of potential! With its intriguing illustrations, fun exploration and mini-games, this was a game I really enjoyed but just became disappointed when I couldn't finish it because of all the glitches the ensued.\n\nI will try again some time to see if any of the problems get resolved and hopefully change the content of this review. But for now, everything stands. Just let me know if you’ve had any similar problems. Below is a video preview of Between Me and The Night, the video had to be done abruptly because of the fact that I encountered one of the glitches again. So if you’re curious and would like to see for yourself, check it out! :)\n\nThank you!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVJZrEPQnhw","November 25, 2015","true","5.5"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","17","21","0","0"

It's a quite interesting game and art design. It has a unique flow of a story as the kid dreams his insane worlds and create things with his mind. Yet that the kid love video games as much as his parents, the house and world will take shape of any unrealistic and childish mind of a young boy.\n\nBesides the good art design, the game pulls you deep into the story for exploring since you have options to intereact objects and many other interesting things to either save in his pocket or "quest" objects. The objects can be anything that might lead on with the story, which you can either do with controller or keyboard. Any object that is interactable has a description, which lead us to the point where the developers are adding more intel to the game, which makes the game more alive.\n\nYet the price point is high for 30-1 hour gameplay in it's current state, then we are looking at something quite unique and we have much to see forward too. So, if you want to see some fantastic art design and follow a young boy while looking through his eyes to either describe his loneliness or what makes him complete, then this game is for you.\n\nHere is the current available content:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXSQvw_8wP0","September 10, 2015","true","2.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","5","6","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/285070/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Between Me and the Night captured my attention. The ability to be someone else is something that I’ve long wanted to be. It’s not that I hate myself but I always wanted to be something more than what I turned out to be. I was a promising basketball player at one stage and had scouts looking at me but illness as well as the fact that I stopped growing when I was 5’7″ and was never an athletic freak good enough to make up for a lack of height stopped me from becoming a professional. I wanted to excel professionally in other athletic ventures but was never very good at anything other than basketball. Other dreams included becoming an air force pilot (my eyesight was never good enough) or an astronaut (I’m fairly intelligent but not when it comes to the required sciences) so being a talent scout, writer, marketer and business person were my limits. Not bad but certainly nothing spectacular. Therefore the premise here was perfect for me. I tend to believe most of us can relate to the young boy in the story who is confronted with the realities of a modern world – including hot topics such as school bullying – and needing to escape it.\n\nThe audio-visual presentation was the absolute highlight of the game for me. I appreciated the technical prowess of the artistic design of the game at all levels. There were a number of aspects that thoroughly impressed me. A good example of this includes (slight spoilers) the way a game within a video game was implemented before the television becomes a spider like insect and claws away from you, early in the game. I thought that it was well implemented. The audio-visual design combine to bring an evocative image of the game that has left me thinking about important social issues long after the game. This may make me sound like a typical critic but I do quite enjoy games that make me reflect upon the important issues of life long after I’ve clicked the exit button. It can be argued that this is as a result of my education and that may be right but it’s not utilized as often as I would like. Everything that is graphically or audibly implemented in the game serves a purpose. There’s nothing that made me think that it was unnecessary or simply too much. It may take a moment for you to understand the why but there always is the why.\n\nUnfortunately I quickly developed a pet peeve with the gameplay. The walking is too slow and while running works there are a number of stairwells and the like that you need to ascend or descend that have to be taken at walking speed. It’s frustrating that you can’t keep running up and down stairs when the walking speed was an aggravating nuisance. Further, this extends to how you manipulate objects and move things – such as climbing on chairs, etc. I felt that it was really clumsy and could have been designed better. Sadly this effects puzzles and other important facets of the game. Several poor game design choices hold the game back. Given that the title tries to blend adventure and platforming genres the flaws in the game mean that it doesn’t quite succeed as well as what it could have at either and you’re left with a game that struggles to be successful in both genres rather than excelling at one.\n\nI have to concur with other reviews that I’ve read. Because the game is a surrealist experience it’s never quite obvious what you’re supposed to do next. I found myself walking around throughout different areas of the game confused. Where do I go? What do I do now? Those are two questions that are acceptable when it comes to puzzles – an answer should be logical but not obvious –  but when it comes to moving from area to area it’s not such a welcome experience. I don’t often like looking up YouTube videos to find a solution to a problem but I had to do so several times during my playthrough.\n\nAn important and positive thing to note is that none of the puzzles require inventory combining. Generally speaking this is something that I don’t like because often games attempt to be smarter than what they are and force you to combine too completely unrelated and silly combination of items in order to proceed. Therefore this can be seen as a huge advantage of the game as it will be one area where searching for a walk through solution is simply unnecessary in stark contrast to other areas of the game.\n\nThe game has the content and the presentation to be spectacular. Unfortunately some of the design choices really hold it back from realizing its ultimate potential. However, the presentation makes Between Me and the Night a highly memorable experience that makes the title an easy recommendation to action adventure fans who can overlook some poor design choices. It’s a surrealist’s delight.\n\nFor similar reviews and our popular giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/\nTo join in our community and our curation please join http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Steamified","February 13","true","16.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

When I previewed the game back in November, I fell in love with the game’s artistic merits but was displeased with the state of the build.  Of course, the question is how can I be critical of something that isn’t complete?  I can’t see the whole picture- don’t know the full intent- I would have to be respectful of the process.  Now, Between Me and The Night is coming out of Early Access, and I can give it a full review.  Sadly, nothing has really changed in the past two months, and that includes the glaring problems that hamper an otherwise enjoyable and thought provoking experience.\n\nBetween Me and The Night is about a young man, journeying through adolescence, dealing with loss and disappointment, and the depression that clutches at his soul.  His crutch is music, movies, and video games- the trifecta for any latchkey kid.  In a very Calvin and Hobbes type way, our protagonist imagines himself a knight, defending the world against- you know, it’s hard to say.  Either way, it’s his escape from a world that doesn’t directly say but heavily implies an unfair shake.  His family seems angry and dysfunctional, school kids bully him, and life hands him nothing but hardship.  Your job is to walk around your home and school, piecing together the puzzle of your life.  The game uses a very simple inventory system that limits a certain size and number of items and presents puzzles to solve before proceeding.\n\nActs are concluded when your character is sucked into a monolithic arcade cabinet, transporting you to a snowy realm where you must battle archers and axemen who stand between you and the castle.  The game’s controls suddenly feel faster, and the focus becomes attacking and defending as opposed to searching the environment.  These sections will make you feel powerful and is an interesting transition away from the more methodical sections proceeding it.\n\nNow, while I enjoyed the experience, I didn’t feel like the message of the game was focused.  Naturally, the player is supposed to feel awkward, escaping life by playing a game like our depressed ‘hero’, but outside of that, there’re some real questions as to what the designers were going for.  There’s elements of birth trauma, questioning of reality and the like- but nothing that really stands out as a full answer.  This is the second time I’ve played the game, and outside of these vague ideas, I couldn’t tell you much more than that.  There’re tapes from someone who’s concerned about your well being, but it doesn’t really explain who they are.  There’s a scene where you rescue a girl from people who turn into spiders, which visually looks awesome, but left me questioning if it truly meant anything, or was more like a fever dream.\n\nPerhaps I wasn’t paying enough attention, and I looked over some of the most subtle clues.  Some of the game just feels like it’s more style over substance, like when a giant head manifests itself down the hall and begins pulling on the rug as if it were swallowing his enormous tongue.  Sure, it’s bizarre and guaranteed to give me nightmares the next time I have a long party night, but what does it mean?  That’s not to say there aren’t thoughtful allusions; I loved finding your mom’s vanity mirror and depression medication wherever you go.  These small touches do fill in some gaps, but I still feel like I was left with more questions than answers when I completed the very short experience.  Also, the ending is very disappointing and abrupt.  If you didn’t have bugs to deal with, you could probably beat this game in a few hours.\n\nAnd yes, there are bugs.  In what I can only describe as a complete shirk, the developers have not corrected any of the glaring problems I found on my first playthrough of the game.  Essential items will pop out of your inventory and into an inaccessible area of the map, forcing you to restart the entire chapter again.  Some items, when retrieved from your inventory, will yield a sprite sheet instead of the single item.  If you walk into an area and return to others, you’ll suddenly find yourself in the background, or unable to interact with anything on screen.  Simply put, the game has invisible hurdles, that will mess up your game, and force you to replay your last ten minutes.  Sometimes, you’ll even know where there’s a glitch, helplessly trying your best to avoid yet another restart.  For example, I had a book that I was attempting to put on a bookshelf and found that if I stood on the table, instead of the chair, I would lose that item and be forced to start over again.\n\nWhen it comes to the game’s visuals, they’re out of this world.  Literally, they remind me of the classic game ‘Another World.’  The polygonal art design is top notch, and the colour palette is exceptional.  The locations transition through the day (a little too quickly), providing familiar areas with the orange glow of sunrise and blue hue of a rainy day.  Creatures are spectacular and have so much thought and imagination to them.  I really can’t say anything critical about how wonderful and poignant the delivery of the art style is.  If I were to review games on their looks alone, this would be a contender for game of the year.\n\nI wish I could say I loved this game. It’s the kind of experience we need more of in our ‘Generic Knight’, beat up the bad guys era of gaming. I’m a defender of empathy games, and I love putting myself in the shoes of other people. While it doesn’t commit the cardinal sin of being boring, it does lack a clear direction. After two times playing and analysing the game, I still can’t come close to defining the core message or possible interpretation I was supposed to take away. I will say though, there are visuals in this game that will sit with me for a while, so if you’re willing to try and decipher the meaning of a piece that may be taking the ♥♥♥♥ than the visuals will be well worth your time- but perhaps not the asking price of admission.","January 24","false","13.5"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","0"

You play as a young man with questionable mental faculties going through a series of traumatic events in his life. The artistic direction of the game is quite nice, with a pleasant surface environment contrasting with the boys inner trauma. The movements and interactions with the world are simplistic, but the experiences take new and interesting directions, which was refreshing.\nAs you go through the game, you learn more about your family and the boys life, but there is no emotional connection between you and the character. You don't experience any of the violence, hurt, and anger that a family going through these events would normally experience. There is nothing other than what the player sees to experience the ups and downs of emotions, and unless the player has personal experience that would tie them to these events, they won't be able to connect with the character.\nThe puzzles are based mostly in thorough exploration of every nook and cranny of the house, or going on scavenger quests. There aren't any complicated puzzles or minigames spread throughout the map, rather a seek and find based system.   On top of that, there were no directives on what the next step or next item to find, so it leaves the player frustrated and questioning the point of the game. I go into more detail about this in the video, which I encourage you to watch if you are interested.\nWhile the art style was interesting, the overall feeling of no direction and constant seeking and exploring make this a game I cannot recommend.\n\nThanks for your viewership and support; for more videos click here.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/SocioPsycho","January 27","false","2.3"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

This is Gamer Guy (In a Suit) from the Echo Army YouTube channel! Today I am bringing you a review of the new point & click puzzle adventure, Between Me and the Night. Between Me and the Night was brought to us on 9/14/2015 by Developer Rain Dance LX and Publishers Lace Games (Lifeless Planet, Robowars) and KISS, ltd (TONS of Steam games incl two I love, Bedlam & Fist of Jesus)\n\n(NOTE: This game was reviewed using a key provided by the Developer)\n\nVideo Review:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/rRGj4a8-V0U\n\nThe "Too Long, Didn't Watch" Review:\n\nVery intriguing tale. Short, but still in EA. Visuals are grand, audio needs work. Big potential, especially w/immersion. Keep an eye, this may round out to be a solid gem.\n\nCurrent state: 3/5\n\nThe "Meat & Potatoes" Review:\n\nWhile this one is still early (in Early Access to be precise!) it has a great deal of potential. This game visually looks great. I love the art style and the controls are very simple to use. Fairly easy puzzles and an interesting story help the pace move along well. It is short, but hopefully that can be addressed since it is still early access. The world is moving, emotionally, in ways. It may touch you, it may not. Depends on your childhood. It certainly has the ability to conjure up thoughts and memories of an earlier time in life. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It only gets a 3/5 due to it needing some rounding out. Better sounds/audio, more gameplay/story, etc. there was a HUGE update recently, so most of the initial bugs are gone. I only encountered minor bugs (I got stuck once behind a chair and could not move) but all in all it was a smooth experience for an Early Access title. I really cannot wait to see how much more this one shapes out.\n\nCurrently rates out at 3/5 and worth the $15 to support the title if you would like to help out. Actual current gameplay is worth about $5, IMHO, but it is still early. I will be following, you should to if this is your kind of game. Potential is there to bump up to a 4/5 easily.\n\n\nHappy Gaming!!!\n\n\nJoin the Echo Army ► https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHZaisOyzF3duSKuBPT8CjQ","November 25, 2015","true","1.7"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","36","4","11","2","0"

There's a lot of neat ideas that makes this intersting like the use of dimensions and lighting.\n\nIf you generally enjoy hard adventure games I'm sure that you'll have a good time here. A few issues detract a little in my opinion though like the very limited inventory space and somewhat clunky controls.","January 27","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I really did enjoy this game as far as I got, but this bug makes it impossible to go further.

I did end up spending 6 hours on it, but mainly because I spent a solid two hours trying to solve one puzzle.\nThere are still some glitches in the game. Sometimes animations or pictures would screw up (eg NPCs disappearing, animations being triggered inconsistently, my sprite disappearing when attacked at an unusal time, an inventory item containing the wrong image for the object). Sometimes I would have difficulty walking up or down stairs in the knight's world. They updated the game since I first started playing so some of these may be fixed already.\nI WISH there was a way to save the damn game between chapters. It autosaves when you progress but if you're stuck on a puzzle (like I was) you have to re-do all previous progress the next time you load the game (though to be fair, once you know them you can redo it pretty quickly...)","January 31","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
