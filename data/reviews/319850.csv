Yeah it is fun, but highly flawed. You are not really trying to get good at building bridges as much as you are trying to get good at understand the game mechanics. I don't know for sure, but I don't think an engineer would have all that much advantage when playing this. It is fun, but I just think the devs could make it so much better without really adding new content (just changing what is already there). They should:\n\n1. Change up the music. It is soooo monotonous after an hour or so. Just have intermittant music if you cannot add any more.\n2. Change up the scenery. It is like the same 3 or 4 scenarios for the whole game.\n3. The roof mechanic is stupid. Just use it less. Why can we not have real elements like wind or weather or something.\n4. QUANTIFY prices and stress for individual parts. Give numbers to things. They never tell you how much money you have - it is simply a meter that you fill up. What is the exact difference between good wood, rope and logs? Is logs twice as good as lumber, or only 1/3? This stuff matters.\n\nThe game is relatively short. If you really want this game, get it on sale or in a bundle IMHO.","September 21, 2014","false","7.4"," 33 of 43 people (77%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","77","33","43","5","0"

I just don’t “get” it. I don’t get why criss-crossing planks of wood positioned in a certain way makes a bridge sturdier rather than weighing the whole thing down. It’s a construction technique that I nevertheless had to pick up pretty quickly whilst playing Bridge Constructor Medieval. You play as the “Architect”, the Kingdom’s one and only civil engineer, whose duty it is to produce bridges when asked. It’s a puzzle game, as opposed to a simulation – which explains a lot, as you may be continually baffled by how things remain aloft.\n\nOriginally a mobile game, Bridge Constructor Medieval, sequel to the somewhat tone-less modern day Bridge Constructor, is a simple affair. The game involves a set of insular, increasingly difficult challenges – physics-puzzles where you’re given a set amount of gold and materials in order to build a bridge safe enough for your Kingdom’s men to cross. Initially there’ll be a lot of horses and carriages meeting their demise, dashed and shattered against cliff faces and rocky gorges below, all due to your shoddy handiwork. Gradually you’ll pick up the techniques required to build the right bridge: one with solid stone foundations, networks of light wooden beams supported by thick, stronger ones, with ropes supporting the entire shoogly mess.\n\nFor the uninitiated, games like Bridge Constructor Medieval are essentially video game versions of the perennial science class bridge building contest in which contestants seek to build the strongest bridge possible using a specific set of materials. In Bridge Constructor Medieval, this challenge is nested within a medieval theme, meaning players have to build these bridges to send letters to nearby allies, repair passages damaged by siege weapons, etc. Most of these challenges ask players to build bridges strong enough to at least transport a portion of the total goods safely across, though there are additional challenges that push players to spend as few resources as possible while maintaining perfect structural integrity.\n\nWhile playing Bridge Constructor Medieval, players alternate between two modes. In the build mode all action is paused, a grid overlay appears in the level, and it is here that players select materials and lay them out for bridge construction. Once this is done, players can switch to the real time mode in which troops and carriages attempt to cross the bridge. At any time players can pause the action or restart to make adjustments to their bridge, which is a nice touch for anyone looking to make the perfect bridge each and every time.\n\nIf there was a thing to complain about with Bridge Constructor Medieval, it is the game's relative lack of polish. Despite having unexpected story hooks and a very handy way of highlighting areas of bridge weakness, the game unfortunately doesn't look as good as it could and its controls can definitely take some getting used to. These are relatively minor knocks in the grand scheme of things, but they are worth noting considering there are other games out there that have provided a similar experience without falling short in these departments.\n\nThe neat thing about Bridge Constructor Medieval is that it offers feedback as you build. When the peasants perform their bridge-crossing, you get to see which parts of your bridge are stressed, and how severely. From there, you can strengthen your supports as necessary – provided you have the budget.\n\nWatching the little guys cross your handiwork can be kind of stressful, though. You wind up holding your breath as green supports turn yellow, then red. Sometimes they snap just as your last horse struggles to pull its weight up over the lip of a cliff. Indiana Jones ain’t got nothing on this.\n\nThough strengthening your defenses against the barbarians is definitely an interesting addition, Bridge Constructor Medieval is enough like Bridge Constructor that it’s safe to say you won’t find much here if you’re luke-warm about the series. Admittedly, it’s a bit of a bore if you have no interest in engineering. Having to pay for hints (in pieces, no less) with hard currency is also sure to turn off some beginners.\n\nIt probably says a lot about my skills as a make-believe civil engineer when my favourite segments were the easy bits which rewarded building death traps. Overall though, Bridge Constructor Medieval is still a very solid experience. Fans of bridge building games should definitely check this one out.","March 16","true","58.0"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","14","15","3","0"

You want to get build a bridge with the materials restrictions given. This requires you to think about the best way to build the bridge without wasting resources.\n\nWhat I liked about this game is that it adds a little bit more to a plain bridge building experience. For most levels you have to get your army across but there are also some variations.  One variation is that you're not only looking to make the bridge hold the load but also shelter your army from incoming boulders. Another variation is that you want the other army almost to get to the other side. This requires you to make a bridge which can almost hold the load.\n\nWould advise to buy this when it's at sale. For the regular price it's just a bit light on the gameplay to match the price. Otherwise I'd recommend this nice bridge building puzzle game.","April 21, 2015","true","2.4"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

There are some cool innovations in this offering though; there is a story of sorts to follow, the chapters are arranged differently; no longer map style which is unfortunate.\n\nThis follow-up to the original is also much harder; the difficulty goes from 0-60 quickly. I personally like a slow increase of difficulty; as opposed to jumping right into complex bridges with 50+ pieces. The medieval aspect and different materials indicative of the era were a definite plus!\n\nWorth $5; more challenging than the original.\n\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/319850/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Last Thursday Steamified covered the original Bridge Constructor. If you’ll remember (or read the article again or for the first time) you’ll know that I really enjoyed the original. I was really looking forward to playing Bridge Constructor Medieval but I never really knew what to expect. What could the developers at ClockStone make differently enough to keep my attention span long enough? If truth is told there isn’t much different except that the challenge is more difficult. This is both a good thing and a bad thing. I’d recommend to newcomers to the franchise to begin with the original unless they were die hard medieval fantasy fans.\n\nOne rather nice addition to Medieval is the introduction of a story. Yes, each bridge or puzzle as I like to refer to them as can be played as individual puzzles but there is a story throughout the entire game. It’s a fairly generic story as far as stories go but it fits the game and is a good touch. The story shapes the way in which the different levels are introduced and how they are themed. For example, the game opens with a series of supply missions that you need to complete. Once you’ve done that you then have a boss fight which is essentially an area quiz where you demonstrate a simple – if you’ve been paying attention – piece of bridge construction knowledge. Then the story moves on into the second ‘chapter’ and so on.\n\nThe focus has clearly been on delivering a more polished experience. There is greater challenge involved. But overall it’s still the same old game that you’re either going to appreciate or decide that it isn’t for you. But I’d like to see as many people as possible give this game and franchise an opportunity if you have yet to do so. I’d ask that you don’t dismiss it out of hand until you’ve at least given it a chance. If it’s not for you then that’s fine but at least you’ve tried.\n\nThere’s not much to write that I didn’t type out the other day for the original. Similar strengths with similar faults just strengthened and improved with a different setting and coat of paint. A good game that suckered me in more than I thought it was going to.\n\nFor similar reviews and our popular daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/\nFor our Steam group please join us at http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Steamified\nFor our Steam Curation please follow http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Steamified#curation","February 9","true","3.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

I think I might have liked the original better because it allowed for sloped bridges which was fun and added some extra challenge I thought. This one tries to make up for it with new modes and has a better (or really at all) story as you take on the role of the royal architect during an attack on the kingdom. You have to build 3 different kinds of bridges, regular bridges, roofed bridges that can withstand flying boulders, and booby trap bridges designed to collapse but not until all the enemies are on them.\n\nMy biggest gripe though is the inconsistency in the physics. Some designs will work one time and fail another with the exact same design. Sometimes a unit will make it across a bridge thats startign to crumble, other times it wont. Sometimes a bridge will collapse and sometimes it wont. I noticed that if i scroll between my virtual desktops causing CPU load to climb it seems to make the physics run in a more shallow iteration, its possible this could be advantageous to someone stuck on a challenge I guess but it was just kind of annoying to have a design fail then spend 15 minutes messing around changing it only to find that the original was actually perfectly functional and I had an unlucky run the first time.","January 10, 2015","true","19.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It would be great if the designers gave users a little more credit and allowed a detailed/advanced mode which showed where the load was moving from to where and why some joints pop before others, better instruction to bridge-building noobs like me, and some better ways to think about building complex structures.","May 25, 2015","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Other new challenges have you build a bridge that is designed to collapse under the weight of the advancing enemy army.  If your bridge collapses too soon, they turn around -- collapse too late, and some of the army still makes it across.  It was a nice challenge to get it collapse at "just" the write time!\n\nI also like how the "Crown" challenges were implemented in the game of reaching the advanced goal, such as building the bridge under even lower cost, or destroying the entire advancing army and not just a smaller number of them.\n\nI set out to achieve all the Crowns from the beginning and it took me close to 7 hours to achieve 100% of the achievements per Steam.\n\nAll in all, a better bridge builder than its "Bridge Constructor" predecessor and certainly worthwhile if you like the genre.  8 out 10.","August 9, 2015","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The placement of support joints is very restricted and many times, joints/lashings will refuse to connect to each other, forcing the player to abandon logic and basically build the bridge the way the game intended it to be built. Overall this game ends up frustrating because it takes away our freedom to build creatively, and forces us to use the same designs to succeed.

This mode began to expose the inconsistencies in the physics engine as you had to build precarious bridges that were under tight tension. This resulted in different results when running the simulations over and over again.\n\nThis version also removed sloping ramps and much of the freedom to be creative... ie jumping cars and stunts. It also had the same building toolset from it's prequel. The combination of these two game decisions resulted in very rigid answers for the later puzzles causing fustration due to lack of ramping up in building experience. Some solutions near the end required meticulous understanding of the support structures which, in my opinion, were very hard for the casual player.\n\n7/10.","February 5","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
