It even caters to those that are not "Great" at Poker. The way they do this is... it has SINGLE PLAYER. So if you feel as if you can not compete with the best, then you can take on the AI. But if you think you have what it takes to take my chips... i will meet you at the table.\n\nOther features that make this game stand out are:\n-3D Avatars\n-Player customization\n-Single player\n-A Story (not completed while writing this, but it is to come)\n-Active Devs that actually listen (contact then via their official forum)\n\nMy review does not do this game justice, you should just download the game for yourself.","May 18","true","75.2"," 35 of 40 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","35","40","4","0"

The character creation was MUCH more in depth than I expected, and that was a nice surprise. I experienced some stuttering frame rates during the short intro scene. The game offers a tutorial that I pretty much just clicked through to get free stuff. It wasn't a big deal, because the game operates off normal poker rules. I was able to beat my AI opponents pretty handily. They appeared to have different betting strategies which kept things interesting. Overall, this was a lot of fun, and considering the f2p model, I can't see why anyone wouldn't enjoy it.

The UI, graphics style, and overall mechanics of the game are very, very, good. If you are looking for a good game  to burn some time with, this IS the best choice. It is also free, speaking of which you can't really complain, if the model is done right. In this case, the devs did a good job with it. You can always play this game without spending a single penny and have no negative consequence to your preformance meaning that this game is NOT pay to win. With that being said, some of the cosmetic items are expensive and will require a long amount of time to unlock.While not a negative, some players may find this off-putting. From what I've seen the community is intact and the player-base is booming.  All this being said, you can expect to find a great game that will suck away many hours of your time as you try to make it big in the world of Prominence.","May 22","true","6.4"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SkyeGames/recommended/384180/","SkyeGames","Skye","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SkyeGames/","77 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI would recommend this game over other poker games. This is not my poker account, if the time played seems low. I have put over 80 hours into this game so far.\n\n+ No pay to win aspect.\n+ They do not bother you with any sort of ads or interruptions. Just poker.\n+ The character motion system is unique and adds another layer to the game. If you need to check your hand, your character shows you doing it. If you say way ahead of time that you will be folding, other players can look at your character and see her getting ready to fold. If you mouse over Call when it is your turn, opponents see your character's hand start to reach for their chips. All of these elements make it feel much more immersive.\n+ The AI for the singleplayer are not brain dead. They also feel as if they have distinct personalities. Try to beat the same table multiple times, you will start to notice those personalities. They aren't just different skins on the same AI.\n+ The game allows off the cuff tournament style tables to be formed. Many poker games only allow tournament style games for their own sponsored tournaments. Here, you can just join one with other players. This is a great function.\n+ A bunch of fun cosmetic stuff like clothing you can unlock and buy with chips. This may seem silly to some, but other players will spend hours staring at my character. I like being able to customize her.\n+ Tables are in rooms that give the actual feel of environment. Not the abstract top down view with disembodied cards that a lot of poker games have.\n+ The devs are very involved and communicate with the community. They also play the game and have an interest in poker. It isn't just a product for them.\n+ There are underground affiliations to associate with, unlock unique clothing and other identifiers with that group. The future possibilities for different players associated with different gangs leaves a lot of future content to be released.\n\n- The only negative I can think of is that at certain times of the day it can be hard to find high buy-in tables. Low and mid tables always have people, but sometimes the more expensive tables can feel a little empty if you are on at weird times. I assume this will change as more people gain chips and can afford the higher tables.","May 30","true","2.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Nothing like buying a 200k suit to sit around at the $100 table. At some point i would hope to see the game have more types of poker than just hold em' yet the game they do have is done beautifly. The only thing i can't stand is that most of the time 2 pair is all it takes to take a hand. Guys, if you ever wanted to play an online poker game then at least give it a try. Much higher quality than i expected.\n\n9/10","May 21","true","10.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

I give it a 8 out of 10.\n\nFeatures\n\nThere's multiplayer, cosmetics to spend your winnings on, single player, friends versus mode, leader board, VOiP while playing the game, avatar character customization and more. There's Texas Hold'em. Chip stacks change in size when you lose or gain chips, making it visually possible to compare earnings.\n\nMultiplayer\n\nYou can play other random people on the internet. You can play with friends but it's limited to versus mode with friends only. Winnings and earns are persistent. Finding a game is fast when using a 1000 chip buy in. Character names allow internet address which would be intersting to those who want to use Twitch or advertise a website. Direct player trading isn't allowed but play with your friend a private 1v1 game, go all in on a losing hand and you've just trade your friend chips. You can "gift" your friend clothes and items you've bought with chips.\n\nFree-to-Play Section\n\nThere's no monthy subscription. No transcation fee anywhere in the game. There's a cosmetic cash shop. You can buy chips with real money but that doesn't guarantee you a win. Should you lose all your chips in all or nothing gamble, you can create another Steam account for more chips.\n\nConclusion\n\nI like the game. A progression system, being able to compete with friends, leader boards, cosmetic shop and everything else will have me recommending this game. I can't wait to see what else is in store for this game.","May 23","true","15.1"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Although the hot micing is too much. There's no way to set microphone threshold or a push to talk. So all you ever hear is background noise, unless you turn the VOIP off. The intro is really long and really loud if wearing a headset and listening to music. First multiplayer poker game. It has a lot of cosmetics you can get with in game currency, which you can spend real money on if you want. However the money you spend won't make you better at poker.

I like it.\nI like it being free, its naif humor and the players, which look like an even mixture of fish and knowledgeable poker players not too angry against the world. I.e., it's not actual poker, but it is soothing. Well done.\n\nTWO requests:\n1) we REALLY need a chat;\n2) Also the option to write notes about a specific player would be welcome.\n\nOk it is free and already good, but it is fundamental to be able to pin down our understanding of an opponent, if he calls everything with 35o till the river, and where all players have beards and that crummy shirt with the skulls, visual memory is definitely not enough.\n\nCan't say anything about the AI, I have played only multiplayer.\n\nAnyway, a nice game, much appreciated.\n\nMany thanks to the developers.","May 28","true","15.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","2"

All the action stops forcing you to quit which means you lose your buyin amount.\n\n-Investments don't add up. Playing for a price pool of 200 chips, for some reason you have to option to 'refill' your opponents chips for 2k. Bonus example: Table items that give you a 5% bonus of xp for x amount of turns cost 2k. Within x amount of turns of bonus xp you won't make back the 2k investment anyway.\n\n-Lack of game modes although it is in beta.\n\n-No option to push to talk instead you have to navigate the main menu to disable or enable your microphone.\n\nA good poker game but alot just doesn't add up and at this point in time you're losing chips due to bugs and it's out of your control.","May 25","true","75.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Graphics and interface are decent. Your avatar has a fair ammount of customisation. Hopefully even more options will be added in the future.\n\nAlright, as you can see in the comments I was contacted by one of the developers which partially solved some of the issues, specifically the frame freezing. Apparently you should keep the video options on medium or high for now. There is still a lot of frame freezing but on these settings it is minimized to 1-2 seconds, making the game fairly playable.\n\nRight now this game is your regular texas hold 'em with options for multiplayer ring game, tournament, and head-to-head. There are also some single player options. As you progress you unlock cosmetic accessories and titles.\n\nWhile it is important to keep in mind that the game still has a lot of bugs, the positive attitude of the developers makes me want to recommend the game despite the bugs. Hopefully the bugs will be ironed out during the next few weeks.\n\n\nI'm leaving the original review for reference:\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGame breaking bugs make this game an awful experience.\n\nIn the book "Good Omens" by Gaiman and Pratchett, the demon Crowley is described as once had "tied up every portable telephone system in Central London for fourty-five minutes at lunchtime". The ensuing frustration of those affected would be taken out on people close to them and so on in a chain of abuse that would tarnish the souls of thousands of people. I would guess that the current incarnation of this game is supposed to fill a similar function when it comes to securing souls for Hell.\n\nWill I be able to even see my cards this round? Will I be able to do anything at all? Do the developers hate people or are they simply desperate to push out the product without any regard to the customer whatsoever? These are the kinds of questions you will be asking yourself as you slowly but surely embrace the darker aspects of humanity while plummeting into an abyss of hate for your fellow man.\n\nThe main issue is constant frame freezes even with a high end PC that plays pretty much everything else on ultra. Other issues consist of the game not starting even when the lobby is full, and the game getting stuck after the short sequence when somebody wins. So not only are you not able to see your cards because the game drops to an FPS of 1 per minute, once it gets going again chances are it will get stuck on the smug grinning SOB that that was able to win that round.\n\nThe tragedy of it all is that beneath the horrid issues lies a decent poker game with ok avatar customisation, graphics, and interface. You should definitely chrck back in a couple of months to see if the bugs have been resolved and this game is not actually some demon's latest strategy to secure souls to be used in the coming apocalypse. If it is the latter then congratulations on a bad job well done","May 23","true","19.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game is fun for what it is, which is a video game. The graphics are good and the reputation system and affililations are cool. Even though this is F2P it is not pay-to-win. Sure, you can buy chips if you want. Any player inclined to buy chips has my full endorsement. There'll be more for me to win.\n\nThis is not real poker; both the AI and the players attest to that. The biggest flaw with the game, in my opinion, is their random number generator. It is complete crap. The flop pairs 3 out of 5 hands, which would never happen in real life. For a real poker player this game is an exercise in patience for exactly the reasons a poker player would understand.\n\nIf you want to just kick back and beat up on players that play way too many hands, this game can be fun. If you can get into the in-game reputation and affililations, this game can be fun.\n\nIf you're looking for a 'real poker' experience then don't play this game.\n","May 25","true","19.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It would have been nice if they put that much effort into their controls which are the worst I have ever seen on a poker game. Virtually no players so far so getting even a minor ring game going is a challenge.

Buying chips lets you play longer or you can use it to customize your character. If it doesn't work for you, then the game will drop frames and glitch in the middle of a game so that you have alt+tab out and lose the game by default. This happened to me every game in single player even after following the dev's suggestion of using windowed mode, so I deleted the local content in my computer.

My friends and I have encountered major lagging issues that are not even computer hardware related or the game randomly drops or hangs suddenly. There has been also some instances where trying to play with a friend is nearly impossible due to many bugs. One of these bugs doesn't allow you to click ready on either end or you might be waiting nearly an hour just to play one single game only to be blind sided out of your chips due to the game hanging. I would recommend this game if it would actually run properly, but until then I will have to wait until these issues are fixed.","June 5","false","7.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

After playing a few hours again I get the same problems again on a lower quality. It can't be that a game like poker needs a higher graphiccard as a game like doom or something else. I think they have a problem with AMD graphiccards and until it's not fixed, it's unplayable for me. About the team I can say it's a realy good Team with a great future! And I think in a few weeks / month they will fix the problem and then I will try it again. If I can play it, I'll change my review again!

That is where the game got muddy for me.\n\nWhile i understand playing with real players that go afk or are being yelled at by their mother can take an eternity to simply click 'check', playing against ai takes bleeding ages! it's way, way, way too slow. you fold on the deal and have to watch the entire hand just to have to winner never show their cards. getting around the table takes far too long when everyone stays in. it just ruins the game 1000% for me. I'm not a huge poker fan, and investing 30 minutes into a warm up game with the easiest AI is enough for me to not want to invite my friends to a private game (not sure if they have them. the only other feature i look for in card games, so if that's not there, it's a deal breaker for me).\nAlso the game is a bear to run. it's an ambitious looking poker game, but it shouldn't be running on lower setting than GTA 5.\n\nSo the TLDR- I see actual promise with an early access game in a genre that could really use a new king. and i don't want to be overly negative because i think the vision for the full game is there.but it certainly needs optimization tweaks, and a shot of addrenaline to be added to offline play. These fixes could make it potentially the best poker game on steam. and i hope in 8 weeks i can come back, erase this review, and say "wow, this one of those games i just come home and play for an hour when i'm having a bad day"","May 28","false","0.4"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","3","0","0"

It's a relatively good one that allows me to play a wide variety of games. This one, not so much. A game like this needs to offer a resolution setting when you start the game, not later. I ended up sitting at the player creation menu struggling through it just trying to get to the menu to turn the settings down. I had to force close it and try again, and when I finally got to the settings I turned them down to the very lowest. This made the game menus run a lot smoother, but as I tried to get into a game, I found I could not. I ended up sitting there for almost 20 minutes while watching the little spinning wheel, and when I finally got in, it still lagged like crazy. Don't bother installing this unless your computer is amazing, which isn't the case for a lot of people.","May 21","false","0.5"," 1 of 11 people (9%) found this review helpful","9","1","11","0","0"

Also, the AI is really dumb and in Single Player mode (Underground) it is very easy to predict the AI's card by their calls and can be easily exploited.\n\nAll together, it's an enjoyable game, what you can enjoy with your friends and take away all ther chips and make them mad.
