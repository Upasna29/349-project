"http://steamcommunity.com/id/irsalamander/recommended/296770/","irsalamander","Duckhunt Doge","http://steamcommunity.com/id/irsalamander/","799 products in account","I will admit it is very nice to see some sports games on Steam, and while I wasn't expecting a whole lot (I paid a whole 3 bucks for the game) I started off really enjoying the experiance but that turned quickly.\n\nFirst, it does look like a nice game. I ran it at full everything and it never saw a chug or hiccup. The lighting was done well and you felt like you were actually boxing. Fighting in Russia saw snowflakes and in Vegas tonnes of flashing lights.\n\nIt's the little things that get to you after grinding the career mode. Firstly, it's a grind. If you win the first belt quickly you will need to replay the same tournement a few more times to earn the credits to level up your character to stand a chance in the later stages. But by the time you've done that the game's terrible AI flaws are very apparent and you won't need half the stats.\n\nStart with a block, jab until your stamina is gone. Block and repeat. You have no actual need for uppercuts/crosses at all. No matter when you knock someone down, you get the same animation as they teleport to the middle of the ring and all replays have what I can figure as sneaker shoe sounds. This is boxing, not basketball.\n\nBut the MAJOR gripe I have. In BOXING you knock an opponent down 3 times... TKO. Real Boxing doesn't have that. I knocked one guy down 5 times in ONE ROUND...... That alone makes me not want to recommend the game. They spent more times working on the giggle of the breasts of the ring girl then googling how Boxing is done.","November 6, 2014","false","3.5"," 101 of 126 people (80%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","80","101","126","21","7"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198110073193/recommended/296770/","76561198110073193","OLD FRESH ™","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198110073193/","615 products in account","Do not be put off by all the negative reviews comparing this game to Electronic Art's Fight Night series of games. Fight Night is a AAA Sports title created by a developer who has a long history of developing boxing games, and it costed 6-times as much as this game. Of course Fight night going to be better, but that does not mean Real Boxing is not an enjoyable game worth it's $10 price tag.\n\nReal Boxing Is more arcade than simulation, and there is not a lot of depth, but the action is fast paced and the multiplayer mode should be entertaining for hardcore boxing fans, at least in short spurts.  The single player career mode is basic, and there are not all that many different characters to fight against, but the mode exists. There are options for editing the appearance of your boxer, but you do not seem to be able to edit your boxer's name, which is a little bit annoying.\nAside from that, there are also the standard training mini games that you would expect to see in a boxing game. These mini games require you to press the right-stick in a certain direction in time with the on-screen cues. As you might guess the mini games become repetitive very quickly (but so did the mini games in fight Night).\n\nThe in-ring boxing action is not very simulation-like, but it's not exactly the mindless button-masher other reviews make it out to be.  You can throw all the punches you would expect (using either an anolog stick or the buttons) but there is no option for using dirty tactics such as headbutts or low blows. You can grab and clinch your opponent, but only when your energy drops below a certain level. Blocking is done with a single button, and it automatically blocks head or body shots as needed. You can also use a perfectly timed press of the block button to slip an opponents punch, creating a slow-motion effect allowing you an extra moment to throw a counter punch. There is no bobbing/weaving. There is no way to take a knee if your getting pummled, and there is no option for switching from orthodox to southpaw stance.\n\nPros:\n\n- Fast paced action with easy to pick-up controls\n- Decent looking graphics and presentation for a budget title\n- Online multiplayer boxing matches\n- Commentary is repetitive but sounds good for an arcade boxing experience\n- it's the only (somewhat realistic) boxing game on Steam\n\nCons:\n\n- Boxer movement/footwork is not very smooth\n- Small roster of characters - No real world boxers\n- Short/uninspired single-player career mode\n- No matchmaking options for the online multiplayer mode\n\nThe bottom line is that it's not exactly a great game, but it's the best boxing game I have on my PC. The game will not have much appeal for most gamers, but hardcore boxing fans will probably find it fun being able to swap leather with other players now and then. It's not Fight Night Champion, but it's actually better than I had expected it to be.","July 2, 2014","true","7.3"," 123 of 170 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","123","170","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hotdogbitchface/recommended/296770/","Hotdogbitchface","Hotdog Bitchface","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hotdogbitchface/","2391 products in account","Well, er. Boxing fans don't exactly have a whole lot to choose from when it comes to Steam games, do they? The truth is, until the Fight Night series makes its way to Steam, this is the best we're going to get.\nThe unfortunate thing is that the "best" isn't really that good.\n\nGameplayThe game plays very similarly to a dumbed-down version of... You guessed it - Fight Night. Fighter movement is controlled with the left stick whilst the punches are mapped to directions on the right stick, or alternatively the face buttons. Left and right shoulder buttons are used for the high-low modifier and block, respectively, whilst tapping the right shoulder button lightly allows for a dodge.\n\nBoth you and your opponent have a health and a stamina bar. Big punches such as uppercuts do more damage but drain more stamina, whilst jabs … You get the drift. Dodging a punch successfully results in a Matrix-like slowdown that allows you to get a solid counter-hit in for extra damage and less stamina.\n\nThe fight goes on until one person knows the other person down and they stay down for a full 10 seconds, or a decision is reached at the end of however many rounds you set it to.\nIt’s the bare bones for any game that tries to call itself a boxing simulator, although the aforementioned issues prevent it from really being a good game.\n\nPoor dodging system - Real Boxing only allows you to dodge in a single direction (i.e. you cannot influence the direction you’re dodging), so the only thing that’s required of the player is timing. The problem is that the dodge comes out so slowly that you literally have to press it before the opponent’s attack comes out. It turns the skill/reflex-intensive dodging system of Fight Night and turns it into a skill-less guessing game\nPoor high-low system – Since there’s no high-low blocking system, holding the block button will block both high and low attacks. What’s worse, unlike Fight Night, where punching the head does more damage whilst punching to the body does less damage but drains more stamina from the opponent (the so-called “money in the bank” approach in boxing), Real Boxing makes no such distinction. It’s almost pointless that they bothered to include body punches at all in this game.\nButton-mashing - You can get through the entire game with button mashing. At no point in the game did I feel that throwing one particular punch was more effective than throwing any other. I beat the first opponent in the game the same way I beat the last opponent – mashing.\nShallow career mode – Literally has you fight one opponent after another, earning cash whilst buying upgrades. Rinse and repeat until you become the supreme champion of the universe or some ♥♥♥♥. Every so often you’re allowed to do a “training mini-game” in order to increase your stats as well. Speaking of which…\nTedious mini-games - There are 3 training mini-games, each improving a separate stat (strength, stamina and speed). Unfortunately, all three are essentially glorified quick-time events, and very easy. It’s incredibly repetitive and tedious, but necessary in order to improve your boxer’s stats\nPoor multiplayer implementation – Purely online matchmaking. No local multiplayer or even the ability to host a game against a friend. I can’t comment further because quite frankly I never got a game going.\n\nOverall, the issue is that the game boils down to a skill-independent, button-mashing affair. I’ve figured out the secret to the game. You ready?\n\nIf opponent has worse stats than you – Mash anything. You can’t lose.\nIf opponent has equal or better stats than you – Hold block. Wait for opponent to drain his stamina, then mash anything. Rinse, repeat.\n\nPresentationI have to admit that the game does look quite pretty for an indie title. Character models look realistic, even if the models are fairly bland. Supports 1920x1080 resolution, which is nice.\n\nSound effects are adequate. Sadly lacks any real music outside of the nauseating entrance music that plays when your boxer walks towards the ring. A single commentator is present for the game, and whilst it’s a nice touch, he appears to only have approximately 10 lines and uses them all at the wrong time. Be prepared as he calls every one of your uppercuts a jab and a complete one-sided pounding as the “Fight of the decade”.\n\nOverall ImpressionI’m an indie gamer at heart. Because of that, I hate games like this. I hate that games like this exist because it’s an example of an indie game making a strictly inferior version of a AAA game like Fight Night and dumbing down all the mechanics and depth whilst hiding behind the fact that it’s an “indie” game. Indie games should never, ever be strict downgrades of AAA games.\n\nUnfortunately, as I said before, us Steam gamers looking for a chance to practice the art of the sweet science aren’t exactly spoilt for choice. This is the best boxing game on Steam right now, and if that’s what you’re looking for then I would recommend you give it a shot. For everyone else though, stay away.","December 18, 2014","false","5.2"," 62 of 77 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","62","77","0","2"

I have this boxing game (REAL BOXING) on my iphone and I enjoy it, here on the PC version they have removed the micro transactions and given you the ability to move around the ring which is something that feels added because that part of the game just seems a little sluggish, there are no Muhammad Ali dancing masters here just flat footed Rocky Balboa type club fighters. But I have to say this is the best "PC" boxing game I have ever played and will gladly support it in hopes we get more Boxing games on PC. The graphics are good, the game supports both keyboard and controller inputs, I like that you can adjust the number of rounds and length of rounds.  There is a quick fight or a career mode, in career mode you can customize and train your fighter to improve his attributes, (although you cannot rename them* UPDATE- The Devs say you can rename the fighter when you create them, click in the box with the name and retype the one you want), there is also multiplayer which is nice and I look forward to. I do not care too much for the in game music or the lame commentator, however the punch sound effects are decent.  I would like to point out that although the Ring Card Girls do seem to have nice physics for their breasts the game really could work on Presentation and Fighter Damage. I would really like to see the DEVs work on and add various cuts, fighter fatigue, some swelling, better footwork, corner men working on fighters between rounds, camera men outside the ring, better fight commentary, a in the ring referee, and ability to change fighter name and face. I will say that I did have a great 12 round fight last night that was very close, I knew this going into the last round and was worried, I did win on points!  I am really hoping that the DEV Team continue to update this game, there is some great potential here and a wide open market for it, now if we could only get someone to make good hockey game! So if you are on the fence I would say get it, it's your best PC option for boxing right now and a decent game for the price. This game screams for the STEAM Work Shop- let the modders go wild and shut EA down!","July 5, 2014","true","9.0"," 48 of 61 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","48","61","0","6"

Its quick, its really simple & easy to pick up, and its guaranteed to make a few laughs if with company.\n\nThe enormous downside to this game, is that mostly everything is dreadful. Boxer customisation, commentary, physics, not to mention the single player aspect doesn't have a storyline. But I mean honestly, for £3.99 on steam your not looking for an AAA game. I purchased the game on a deal so it cost me 20% of its "now" price, so with all things considered and the price that I paid I am fine about that.\n\nBut the reason I am giving this a thumbs down rather then a thumbs up is because of the Developers ridiculous game description, which in essence is a complete lie.  Vivid Games describes it as "ultra-realistic" with "incredibly deep gameplay" with a "comprehensive career mode" which is an absolute joke. If it wasn't for me being such a huge boxing fan and the lack of boxing content on steam, I would have completely skipped this.","January 16","false","20.2"," 28 of 35 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","28","35","3","4"

The sounds of punches landing and that sort of thing is satisfying. There is supposed to be bruising and stuff on characters who take hit's. But I didn't notice any of that. Maybe the Australian version is censored or I need to select it in the options.\n\nYou improve your boxers stamina, speed and strength by complete mini games (the skipping, speed ball, hard bad stuff). You basically just have to press key's in a certain sequence. I think it's supposed to get progressively more difficult at high levels. Then you fight. You can do quick fight (which just pitted me against the same AI opponent repeatedly), tournament for a series of fights or online vs other players. I didn't wait long enough to get matched for an online fight so I haven't seen what that's like yet. Also I'm sure you're supposed to be able make bet's using in game currency on matches but I couldn't find anything like that.\n\nBeating up your opponent and knocking them out is fun. Initially I just spammed the exact same punch repeatedly and won matches without a problem. But in career mode it was starting to get hard by only the second match.\n\nI think this game could be a lot of fun because it look's like it might be really challenging to beat the career mode. And I really like the sound of the online mode. Might be really good to vs. some friends. You can punch people over the internet.

I've had a few online fights and even though the first couple of fights I beat the guy senseless and knocked down my opponent I lost on points somehow, I think when punches are blocked they count as an hit.

I generally do not like to diss on the product of other people's hardwork; viz-a-viz negatively criticize a developer's game, but only if I smell a single drop hard work's sweat in the same zip code of the 'product' I am reviewing.\n\nLet me give you a little background, I have spent more than half my childhood playing fighting games on my good old ps2 and the other half I spent tending my sore thumbs after over-playing Fight night games from EA.\nWith that said you might think I'd compare this game with the Fight Night series but to be honest this is not even a half arsed attempt to make a proper clone of that game.\n\nAnyone wanting to try this game, I'd stop you right there and rather suggest you to try the old Fight night series of Ps2 or Ps3. Off course you'd be downgrading graphically but fighting game's are not just about graphics. The Fight night games of Ps2 will beat this game hands down in every department - other than graphics off course. Speaking of which they aren't really that great to begin with here.\n\nThe Good :\n┼ The game is on PC. Cheaper than buying an used Ps2 and Fight Night CD's.\n\n┼ Get to pounce a HHH / Kofi Kingston lookalike.\n\nThe Bad\n┼ Everything.. it's not even an early access game and it has a lot of bugs including getting you and the ai opponent stuck in a groggy state for an entire round and no keys would work - not even the Game pause / ESC key.\n\n┼ A bad re-skin attempt of Fight Night games, the developer must be in the wrong industry, this is NOT the iphone/android game-app market.\n\nThe Ugly\n┼ Even if I forget every OTHER ugly thing about this game, which includes - but is not limited to : lack of customization for characters, lack of country flags / nationalities etc etc .. despite all that.. the ONE most annoying thing about this game is that it reuses the theme music from Falling Skies (not the game).. albeit a remixed version.. a very annoying remixed version.\n\n┼ My Rating : 1/5 NOT RECOMMENDED  Nuff said..","December 6, 2015","false","6.4"," 19 of 27 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","19","27","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Midtronic/recommended/296770/","Midtronic","Midtronic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Midtronic/","94 products in account","I'm torn on how to review this game.\n\nIf I consider it as arcade-ey, it's absolutely passable.  I might even recommend it to a friend who is into the sweet science.  If, however, I consider it as a boxing sim (which I think is how it's trying to present itself, given the title and promo material), it falls far short.\n\nWhile the graphics are decent, that's about it.  There just isn't much to this game.\n\nThere are three "tournaments" which will give you completion and credits.  Credits can be used to purchase some upgrades (not many -- think "lower the stamina cost of your jab").  You can also play training minigames once every five fights to gain a few points in each of the three (just 3) main skill categories.\n\nIf you fight above your ratings, you'll be slaughtered.  If you fight below, you'll be doing the slaughtering.\n\nAs for the fights, again, there's a good deal of what I'd consider necessities for a sim completely absent.\n\nBlocking is all-or-nothing -- if you block, you'll block all punches, regardless of where they're aimed.  No covering your midsection at the expense of your face, no getting your hands up and leaving your body exposed.  Which, I should mention, isn't a huge problem, as there's no practical difference in where punches land.  An uppercut to the midsection is equally as damaging as an uppercut to the chin, and neither will have any long-term bearing on the fight (e.g. no laying into body shots at the beginning of a fight to wear out an opponent).\n\nThough the scorecard shown at the end of a fight has 12 rounds listed, fights always last 3.  Rounds are 1 minute long.\n\nAll in all, if you're looking for what's essentially PunchOut with a less interesting cast of characters and improved graphics, this is probably worth your time.  If you're looking for a sim, trying to be light like a butterfly and sting like a bee, applying that sweet science all over your opponent's face, look elsewhere.\n\n4 DQs (afaik impossible in this game) / 10 TKOs (afaik impossible in this game)","August 5, 2015","false","4.2"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

Which means I have still yet to knock down any fighter at all. Even after all that I still find it to have a solid structure to the game and if they add the things I talked about, plus custom boxer creator it would make the game a hit. I would recommend buying it as long as the dev keeps updating this game to continue improving what they have started with. Not just to make a quick buck and leave the game to rot.

If you go into the game trying to compare it to that, you'll be disapointed to say the least. But, if you go into it looking for a game where you can waste a few hours every now and then beating on peoples faces, you'll quite enjoy this. This is a mobile port, but I was surprised to see that it's not your crappy run of the mill port that you usually get. The graphics are decent, not mind blowing, the controls are very responsive, and it just feels good when you land hits on the AI. There is a career mode where you can create your own character and fight various other fighters in a bracket for a belt. Leveling up your character is quite fun. The more fights you win, the more points you get to help level up your character. You can even buy perks for your character to get more of an advantage. The fights do sometimes come down to button mashing, but there are also tactics involved in being proficient at the game.\n\nThere is also multiplayer. I've played a couple matches and it's great so far. I got my butt kicked in both, but I admit that it was a fun experience. There was hardly any lag and I connected immediately when another person was found. I was surprised that the multiplayer even worked considering how some of the big AAA titles that get ported to PC can't even get their multiplayer to function properly.\n\nNow, are there things that this game can improve on? Yes, of course. Many. Camera animations, voice acting, more mini games to help boost your characters stats, better character customization, and just overall a lot more content can be added to the game. But, if the devs continue to improve upon this game, it can turn out to be something truly fantastic.\n\nEdit: Yes, you can play against your friends in multiplayer. They just have to be ready to accept the invite quickly. I expect that to be fixed very soon though.","July 6, 2014","true","11.1"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","15","21","0","0"

Real Boxing is such a game (its sequel with its Rocky homage could be pretty cool and probably a more refined version of this game) which sports an arcade style boxing game that can be a good pastime if you are patient enough to wait for your next AAA game on your wishlist until its released or receives a substantial discount.\n\nThe problem is that Real Boxing was not a good pastime for me. I hated the frequent FPS drops, the mindless grinding that is needed otherwise you simply cannot complete the next tournament. Visiting the gym to increase your stamina, strength and speed is possible after every 5 matches (only participation counts; winning these is not mandatory) or you can spend your hard-earned credits to increase your stats right away. So, you go to a quick match then quit after 5 wins or you repeat the same tournament you have already completed - rinse and repeat.\n\nThe simplistic menu design and the overall gaming experience clearly indicates this is a mobile port. There are, however, better games than this and perhaps picking its AAA equivalent is a much, much better choice. Real Boxing is not necessarily a bad game - it just does not have anything to do with real boxing.","April 23","false","5.0"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

It's just very clunky, rigid and that you'd question if the game was actually made by people who know what boxing is.\n\nGameplay:\nEssentially I breezed through the Rookie fights, tried online play, fought a guy with 100% stats. Got KO'd in 4-5 hits.\nThe online just matches you against random people it seems so it's probably a good idea to get your guy to 100% before trying online.\nSo after being disappointed about the online play, I decided to try the story mode again and play the next stage.\nWhich also seemed to be a very bad idea. The difference in strength between me and the NPC characters was quite staggering. I landed 24 hits and yet take off only a portion of their HP and everytime I staggered them they seemed too far for me to even hit them. Overall the gameplay experience was extremely exhausting and frustrating.\n\nSound:\nIt's very limited and the commentator ends up being an enigma that just repeats the same lines all the time.\nNothing special here.\n\nGraphics:\nThe graphics are surprisingly good. The game itself looks nice however their seems to be a lack of overall uniqueness to the characters and a lack of just about every type of customization.\n\nOverall Rating: 4/10 - Not Recommended\n\nFor 1 Dollar or 87 pence on Humble Bundle it's worth the 2 hours I put into it. However I'd recommend you not spend any more than that on this game unless you are a serious boxing fan that's willing to play anything.\n","July 25, 2015","false","6.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I really did. But it has just far too many problems to ignore. I'll list some of the pros, and then some of the cons.\n\nPROS:\n-Nice variety of modes, from career, to multiplayer, to quick fight, to sparring sessions and training where you can improve your fighter\n-Game looks pretty decent\n\nUnfortunately, the good essentially ends there.\n\nCONS:\n-Animations are atrocious, especially in the training sessions\n-Moving around the ring feels like you are fighting the air, it is so rigid and stuttery\n-Nearly every punch looks like they are ragdoll based, so you get horribly disjointed and unnatural looking arm flinging\n-camera is zoomed in way too close, giving you no sense of location in the ring\n-Stamina bar has huge issues, 3 punches and you are dead tired. It takes 3 to break an oponent's block.\n-AI is terrible\n-The pace is so slow because of the stamina issues, the matches just become long drawn-out staring contests between 2 boxers forever in block mode\n-because of the snail's pace, plus stamina problems, speed and finesse are completely non-existent\n-Annoying announcer\n-Extreme lack of customization\n-Lack of gameplay options\n-Lack of fight venues (even Rocky for the NGC had more than triple what this has, and it came out in 2002!)\n-Each player has a health bar the size of Long Island, meaning KO's never happen\n-No point total shown at the end of a round\n\nAll in all, I would stay well clear of this game. The PC still sadly doesn't have a good boxing game yet. and it looks like it won't for a while. If you have a Gamecube, do yourself a favor and find a copy of the Rocky game online.

It's not fun, it doesn't do a good job of emulating boxing, which is why I would imagine boxing enthusiasts would want out of a sports boxing game.\n\nTechnical stuff - No customisability, resolution and graphics effects are locked, you can't change them.

From the description I thought this was going to have interesting choices of tactics (in vs. out) and customizable characters from the get-go (chin vs. speed). All fighters stat the same, and build up, spent on winings. You can also buy different colored gear and hairstyles with the money, which is just throwing away money that coulod be spent on better stats, and is a compele trap. Overall, the controls feel unresponsive (there feels like a long delay between when I hit the button and the attack) and clunky.

The game starts as 3 1-minute rounds. This should be a good indication of how good of a simulation it is. If you are going to play it, be sure to adjust the round and time totals and also turn on the blood. I would highly reccomend playing with a contoller. I found the keyboard controls to be nearly unplayable. Even with a controller, the controls were sluggish and occasionally unresponsive.\n\nThe mechanics of the game are pretty basic. You have a health bar and a stamina bar. The stamina bar determines the strength of your punches. It is short and regenerates quickly. Your health determines how many hits you can withstand before getting knocked down. There is a block and it will block any three consecutive punches where it will then break and place you in a stunned animation. The sway mechanic is a joke. You tap the block button when you see a punch coming for your head and if you timed it right, time will slow and give you a chance to swing back with bonus strength. However, there is little rhyme or reason to it it seems. There will be times when they "dodge" the punch but your arm crumples up against their head after connecting with  their character model. When you get low on health you are allowed access to clinching up to regain health. This is a button mash game which starts off easy but becomes quite difficult against later opponents. Standing up from a knockdown is played the same way but the difficutly picks up after the 2nd time you go down.\n\nThere are only 3 stats in the game. Strength is for damage. Stamina is for your health and stamina bars. Speed is for the speed of your punches and how fast you walk around. You upgrade them through minigames that you gain access to every 5 fights. They aren't very enjoyable. Minigames is the right way to go but they made them feel more like a chore than a way to make your guy stronger. Thankfully you end up buying most of your stats instead of playing those games. You can pick two perks for your fighter out of 8 or so. They can make your punches cost less stamina or help you in the button mash clinch/standup games. While your characters stats feel like they don't matter, having a strength 5 points above their stamina will give you incredible amounts of damage. Strength feels like very much the most useful stat, especially early.\n\nPros\n-It is a boxing game on PC\n\nCons\n-The mechanics are bad\n-Character customization is lackluster at best\n-This is not a boxing simulation game","August 13, 2015","false","5.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Fight Night is a 'Triple A' title from a company with a seemingly limitless budget at it's disposal. Don't be turned off by so many bad reviews that this game has to be Fight Night or it's junk. Fight Night is a full-priced title and this is a budget-priced title ($8 at the time of this writing). Some people need to set their expectations appropriately.\n\nThat said, I really enjoy this game. Part of it might be related to how long I have wanted a boxing game on PC. Part could also be due to having my expectations set so low by reading so many negative comments from others. I can say with certainty that I am glad I didn't listen to all of those comments. The game is not nearly the "button masher" that several people have made it out to be. Speaking of button mashing, you can also use the analog sticks to fight, which was a pleasant surprise to me, as I must have missed that bullet point prior to purchase.\n\nThere are already several accurate reviews already out there (look up "Courteous George"'s for example.His is spot-on in my opinion), so I won't go into great detail. I will just sum this up by saying it's not Fight Night, but it's not a button mashing half-hearted boxing game that was made in a few weekends as some sort of money grab. It is a quality budget title (yes, they can co-exist!) that I would have no problem calling Fight Night Lite, for those who cannot get past the Fight Night comparison. :-)","July 6, 2014","true","16.6"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

Also when u first start the game the punches might seem laggy but its not, your punches will get faster once u train your fighter more. I use a Xbox controller to play and it works great and the controls r real easy and preset with the buttons, Xbox buttons show up on the screen when it tells u to do a combo in training.

There is no "connect" it takes a brief second for the punches to connect (look at number 2 issue for more input)\n\n2.  The AI is "average" offering no real competition unless you play against boxers with higher stats. But then again the whole "inept AI" can slowly pop up. The best way to win? is to keep throwing punches in any shape or form, and avoid knockouts.\n\n3. Lack of in-depth customization. I was hoping that we can customize our own entrance and make it "grand" for our boxing character, and lack of boxing attire and equipment.\n\n4. Career mode could've been more interesting. Seeing your boxer rise from humble beginnings into being a superstar.\n\n5. Mutliplayer is fun, but it can be truly worth the time if you are both boxing fans. Also more and unqiue boxers to fight with.\n\n6. More boxing characters? you will face the same boxers over and over again. Play Mutiplayer if your sick of fighting the same guys over and over again.\n\n7. "perks" need to be more than just enhancing your characters stamaina and get ups after knock down\n\nThis game supports Gamepads. Best to play it with a gamepad so you don't have to rebind your keys the way you see fit\n\nLastly, "Gym" is prety straight forward. You practice to hone your skills if you have enough money you can 'rise' your stats up quicker and also there is a practice fight to see how much your character has improved.\n\nThis game is not 'over the top' as fight nights.

Do your homework before you buy as this is not a triple A title being sold by EA.\n\nIs there anything wrong with this game? No there isn't. Graphics are as good as they come and do not interfere with game play. The game play itself is relatively simple and sort of copies the usual boxing controls we're used to. The right stick just tapping it diagonally left or right (upwards) initiates a jab, going left or right initiates a hook, and going bottom right initiates an uppercut. The punching system sort of feels arcade-ish to a point but has it's moments of simulation. Regardless, the impact system is rewarding and it's nice seeing an opponent go down after countering a punch, putting a few combos together and finishing with a nice hook. The movement system is a bit unfamiliar however the dodging system is again rewarding. The time slows down, your stamina rises, and your fighters ready to deliver a blow given you tell him to.\n\nI like this game. This isn't fight night as many other reviewers are saying but there is enough depth in this game to keep one busy. Train your fighter, make him fight in tournaments, single bouts, make money, spend it at the gym or on your appearance.\n\nFor what it is, I'd give it a\n\nRATING : 7.15/10.\n\n\n***update***\n\nI wouldn't buy this if you're barganing on playing your buddies for fun.

The game is fun for a few hours but becomes quite repetitive.\nThe repetitiveness comes from the fight system being very basic.  Punch Punch Punch and back away.  You rinse repeat this system over and over again until you knock the other fighter down.\nYou progress through 3 different belts with 10 fights a piece.  However the jump in difficulty from the first to the 2nd belt is big.  You need to beat the 1st belt several times before you can compete in the 2nd belt with a fighting chance.  As you progress you can upgrade your character, but at such a slow rate. I had 50 fights to my fighters name and still couldn't compete in the 2nd belt.\nI don't want to say avoid this title, but you may end up putting it down in the short period of time I did.

It's only $10 and developed by a smaller company.  If you want total boxing simulation fun time, buy a console and support EA's decsision to ignore the PC gamer community.\n\nIf you are in the mood for a boxing arcade game, Real Boxing is the game you are looking for.  It uses the Unreal engine and it's obvious imediately.  However, the use of the engine in this case is rather uniqe and it's neat to see a developer using the engine for something other than an FPS.  The single player mode is pretty short but it is useful for building up stats to kick ♥♥♥ at multiplayer mode. The training mini games are pretty repetitive and snooze-worthy but getting good at timing is pretty useful too in the long run.\n\nSome reviews say that this game is nothing but a button mashing fest.  I have found that having a strategy and timing punches works a lot better than just button mashing, especially when your character's stats are low. The controls are pretty straight forward and are similar to other fighting games on PC.  Having a gamepad is ideal.\n\nDon't let the bad reviews fool you.  This game is a pretty good experience for the money providing you aren't expecting a Fight Night clone.  It's kind of a shiny, 3D version of Super Punch Out so if you loved that as a kid, consider giving Real Boxing a try.","September 23, 2014","true","6.5"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

If you knock him stupid and and he's staggered and can't defend himself, your character suddenly loses the ability to move forward, and more importantly can't hit him with what would most definitely be the killing blow. If your character is staggered, your opponent can teleport punches from incredible distances with relative ease. No matter what your stats, your health bar will almost always be less than your opponent. He lands clean shots that you blocked, blocks devistating blows without actually blocking, and will most always win the clinch or use it to run out the clock (which is ridiculous - where's the ♥♥♥♥in' ref...?) And this is just the tip of the iceberg.\nI can't image where this is gonna go when I, (if I'm allowed to) advance in the game.\n\nLike I said, I admit I suck at video games, so it really frustrating when a game that may have won fairly pulls some crap like this.\nGames that cheat are the reason I stopped playing games back in the Nintendo/Atari days because I'm hardly good enough to win in a fair competition.\n\nThe only reason I'm NOT recommending this game is because of that. But if the game developers fix it, or at least update it with an easy level option for non-gamers like me, I'd switch back to a positive review and recommendation in a heartbeat. Because otherwise, it's a great game for the price (and PC port playabilty)","December 24, 2015","false","5.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Actually I do know why; buying a mobile game for the PC makes me feel gypped, hustled, ripped off, like I paid real money for some fake game made for lesser devices. Like someone took my hard earned money right out of my pocket when I wasn't looking. Like a thief, a con-man, a low-life would do! Needless to say, I don't think too much about mobile gaming, at the moment at least. And in case you haven't guessed it yet, this game is in fact a mobile port.\n\nThe majority of mobile games I've played felt incredibly easy, most likely to account for the fact that they're meant to be played on a touch screen without a physical controller. And this game is no different. Which is a bit upsetting for me to admit actually, because at first glance this game comes off as a pretty solid boxing simulator that I never would have guessed originated on smartphones. But after playing it for a few hours I quickly realized how bad of a game it really is, and how clearly meant for smartphones it initially was. Basically all you have to do is lose a handful of matches, level your player up, then never lose again. Because the only difficulty in this game comes from having a weak player. After his levels raise, your opponent's weaknesses become blatantly apparent and all you need to do from there is blindly punch and jab your way to the top. Seriously, all you need are your right and left jabs and nothing else. The game is seriously that easy.\n\nAside from the simplicity of the game, there are still plenty of other reasons to avoid this game like a week old gas station breakfast burrito. For starters, after you complete the incredibly short career mode there really isn't anything else to do, and the game doesn't even try to give you any kind of incentive to keep playing. Typical mobile game. Also, the announcer has about twenty things he says in total and you'll grow tired of them all within an hour. Typical mobile game. The intros are the same for every match, the controls are good but could be better, and there is barely any variety of places to fight. The only thing that may be redeeming about this game is the online play, but I never got into that because I was too discouraged by the single player experience. At least I got this game in a cheap bundle for a few bucks. And for that I'm grateful.","January 12, 2015","false","3.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

I am not talking about the gameplay. I am not talking about the blood graphics. I am not talking about the commentary. I am talking about a combination of them all. The commentary especially is repetitive, though they do change ring announcers after a match, so that's a good thing.\n\nThe Career mode simply has a series of matches where your pre-selected character goes though in order to receive the belt. However, the matches are simply too easy, though I do agree they scale from belt to belt and from match to match.\n\nThe Training system however, is rather fun. Sure, it's a simple rythm mini-game, but it does give a nice addition to the game.\n\nI would only reccomend this to boxing fans that want to try out a different angle at the sport.

The announcer gets boring after a while, the ring girls looks horrible--I wouldn't tap that squarish booty myself, but you can turn off the announcer and you can skip the trailer-trash ring girl with a press of the button. Yes, you CAN dodge to the left AND backward not just to the right. One reviewer complained that you have to dodge before the guy even throws a punch--well, in real life your opponent isn't going to warn you that he's about to throw a punch! If you pay attention you can move just in time.\n\nWhile it's true that the game doesn't natively work with most gamepads (unforgivable flaw) the x360ce vibmod fixes all controller issues (just find your controller's hardware ID for your "PID" device, not the USB (at least in my case) and put the respective numbers after "0x"in the PID and VID lines near the top of the ini file--like so:\n\nVID=0x0d9d #controller VID\nPID=0x3013 #controller PID\nI almost never use controllers for games but it's way more comfortable to play this game with one, though the "training" is better on keyboard--just press Q & E at the right times.\n\nThe AI of the fighters is noticeable if not perfect and each fighter has his own style and it does seem that he adapts to your favored attacks. Body blows CAN slow down your opponent if you actually land them consistently. Hopefully, I'll be able to update this review after I've finished the game.

They at least are ok. As for most comments saying it's "arcade style" I think even arcade gaming on an old arcade machine is better then this. If you do buy it cause even i thought "it can't be that bad" it is that bad.","April 8","false","0.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

However, there is no depth.  What the description of this game doesn't tell you is that you have to choose from a fixed set of characters so your starting stats are also fixed.  The training mini-games are neither interesting nor challenging.  Overall, it just seems like a LOT of corners were cut.\n\nThe makers of this game saw an opportunity: there are no decent boxing games for PC out now so they made a poor game with good graphics to distract you.  I would much rather find 4D Boxing somewhere in the depths of the internet and play that than play this game.","November 28, 2014","false","2.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

While there is a lack of boxing games on PC, this game is not up to standard. The animations are very poor and the gameplay is poorly thought out. Career mode is very skinny with three mini-games that you can only occasionally use to train your boxer, and the title fights are insanely easy on the first circuit and insanely hard on the second circuit. Progression is really repeatiing the same low-level circuit until you can get enough cash to boost your stats to survive getting hit in the next level.\n\nThe fighting mechanics lack any flow or depth. You cannot throw combinations, so boxing is simply a matter of tapping the jab or hook button. Blocking is a one-button affair, and while you can punch through a block, you don't have enough stamina to exploit it. Hit reactions are awkward - punches don't connect to the opponent, so if the opponent is staggering, your punches are sure to miss, which is very unintuitive. The counterattack system seems like something nice, but it's really just an opportunistic slow-mo which is botched by the lack of fluid fighting.\n\nThe characters are all the same. There are no distinctions between boxing styles, so it's really just a slugfest. It's disappointing to see a "Real Boxing" title feature nothing that makes boxing real.\n\nSome other huge flaws:\n\n* Clinch mini-game has no timer. You can clinch for the entire round.\n* Getting up from a KO immediately goes into the fight, allowing the opponent free hits before your controls are live.\n* No three-knockdown rule. The AI is generally unable to come back and gets knocked down right away, but there is no way to win by TKO.\n\nIn a nutshell, winning the game is merely based on when the AI "forgets" to block rather than any tactical gameplay.","December 10, 2014","false","5.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

There is no high-low block system to speak of and really no variance to keep things interesting.\n\nAdditionally, this game lacks all polish and charm.  No character creation or custimization, no sense of progress, nothing to keep you coming back.

I really have fun playing this game, but there is too many simple problems to fix that are not going to be. Multiplayer takes at least a minute to match make IF a match is found that is. The majority of the time I am cought in an infinite search never leading to a fight. During training the symbols that correspond to what you need to replicate dont appear. How do you produce proper input if the symbols are not even suggested? Fight Mechanics are broken. When you open up your opponent they stumble back leaving you out of reach for any follow through punch. What is the point of adding this feature to the game then??  Block is anything but responsive which should be essential to ensure before release. Campaign mechanics are really poor. The stats make no sense. Between the three belt titles the same situation happens. The first couple of players are too easy yet the championship match is just a push over. Players with the least amount of wins end up being more of a challange then the leading players.  The whole game was just far too easy and i dont consider myself amazing at this game.

This is not, in any way, shape, or form, a real boxing game.\n\nFirst things first, the game doesn't help itself by having a shoddy set up. The game defaults of medium graphical settings regardless of your rig when you first start the game. Do yourself a favour, ignore the people moaning on the forums, go into the settings, set everything to max and switch blood on, then restart the game. The game looks at least on par with Fight Night Champion, possibly better, though it's hard to tell as this has a more cartoony aesthetic that makes a direct comparison difficult. For a budget title, the graphics are more than adequte.\n\nIt doesn't help that this was obviously put together by people with no real knowledge of boxing. A 'right jab' is not a jab, it's a straight cross. Common terminology here people.\n\nSo, the boxing itself. This game stinks of 'gotta match budget Fight Night' all the way through;\n\nTraining mini-games? Check, but they're ripped straight out of a late 90's early 00's copy Dance Dance Revolution and require you to press the right button when it flashes green in a box, at the right rhythm. The training teaches you absolutely nothing useful for in the game, it's bashing buttons to increase your stats.\nAI that struggles to overcome a simple jab-jab-straight combination? Check, with the added bonus of having an AI that only seems to throw Hooks/Uppercuts, it's easy to play an outside fighter and jab them to death. Speaking of styles...\nEven less of a distinction between the styles than Fight Night has. No stances, no punch styles, as far as i'm aware no southpaws, no footwork, no leaning beyond a rudimentary 'press button to dodge'.\nUnlimited hold button to block? Check. Slightly better than Fight Night in that 3 punches will break the block, ruined by the fact the canned stagger animation ALWAYS takes them out of the range of any of your punches, meaning breaking the block is essentially worthless. Speaking of animations...\nAnimations are horrible. Knockouts could have come from Knockout Kings on the old N64, no physics, no impact, just a guy falling over like a tree. Tiiiiimbeeeeeeer!\nCanned, nonsensical commentary? Check! My guy has not won the title, it was a standard tournament match with nothing on the line. 4 jabs in a row is NOT a 'tricky combination', a straight cross is NOT a 'nice jab'.\nBad blood effects? Check! After the bad blood developed in the Fight Night community after EA rebalanced the blood effects with the bare knuckle DLC, this game looks like it's been made by a group of 15 year olds who think every boxing match should have arterial blood sprays coming from every hook. The ring gets spattered with bright red blood, dripping from each fighter by the end of the first round. Speaking of damage....\nThere is no inter-round mechanics. No trainer tips, no swelling/cut management, no punch stats. Your health is auto-healed between rounds and you have no real idea of how you're doing, as there are no colour commentator scoring cards.\n\nThere is also no referee. This means no fouls, no point deductions, unlimited clinches, no rabbit punching, etc. The clinches are especially annoying, as there is no end if you and the AI are evenly matched. It's another pointless minigame.\n\nThere are some pros for the game however. Punch stats are generally realistic, as your fighter will be winded after throwing 4-5 punches that land, or missing 1-2 punches. This leaves a realistic rhythm of jab-jab-hook/cross/uppercut before backing off again and finding a new angle. This is however ruined by the lack of footwork etc. meantioned above. It is also ruined by the fact that Stamina is permanent and non-degrading. This means body shots have no value whatsoever. It also elaves something to be desired when you're pushing for a KO, as there is no way to keep up real sustained pressure.\n\nOverall, this is an above average game. It's very reasonably prices, it looks and sounds fine, while the gameplay has been made by people with no real understanding of boxing. Treat it as a arena based quick beat-em-up, with 3, 1 minute rounds, and it's passable.\n\nBetter yet, download an emulator and play Fight Night Champion.\n\n6/10.\n\nEdit: Upon completing the game, several achievements did not unlock. 3/10 if they don't sort this basic functionality out.","July 8, 2014","false","5.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Plus it's the only boxing game in steam that i know.\n\nCombat is more toward simulation than arcade gameplay, where you can't simply smash buttons to win. You need to think your strategy for the whole round, and the following ones. I found the mechanics equilibrated (although dodging is a little irritating, but adds a random factor to the combat).\n\nPlaying tournaments to grind stats could be a long run or boring for some people, but for me it's fun (always wanting more and more!), while learning how to play deeper at the same time.\n\nIn my case were around 17h to win all tournaments (3) without any KO/lost match (leveling stats before to a little more than my adversaries). Although the last tournament is always hard.\n\nGraphics/animations are great, the sound/music is ok, the feeling of contact is really well done.\nI highly recommend the game, i repeat, for what it is. It's my humble opinion.\n\n\n\nAnd now my only "great" complaint:\nThe game didn't work without tweaks.\n\nIn my case: >>"Windows XP"<< (wow!), nvidia GTX570, intel Q9650, 4gb RAM.\n- The game works fluid with max settings, but once loaded the main in-game menu:\n\n> After 8-15s, the game tries to connect to internet, and i got kicked to the desktop with an application error window.\nThe only solution i found myself is to block the game access to internet with my firewall. I don't know if it's a kind of protection, or check, or whatever thing it is, the only thing i can do to avoid be kicked to windows desktop is simply blocking the game access to internet.\nSo i didn't tried multiplayer obviously :)\nAfter that, i got each 8-15s of in-game time, a pause of five seconds long. But "ONLY" when moving around in-game menus (yeah, it's like the game is sending/waiting for online info, and after some tries, it continues).\nOnce started a match/tournament, the game is fluid, without interrupts/pauses.\nAt least, i can play!\n\n> After each tournament final match, the game gives, again, an error to desktop.\nSolution: Not found. Just load / run again the game, and continue. The match results are saved before the error, thankfully.\n\n\nP.D: I hate to train after each match.\n\nRegards,\nHave fun!","March 31, 2015","true","21.0"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","4","8","0","3"

The controls are really simple and you can really feel a difference when training your character. Each time you get hit or knocked out, you struggle with the same thoughts: Can I still win this fight? Can I still win this tournament? Should I change my tactics?\nIt is a really exhilating moment when you watch the winning ceremony after defeating a strong opponent. I haven't tried the multiplayer mode yet but I've really liked the singleplayer mode so far, though it seems to be pretty short because there are only 3 tournaments with 9 fights each. However, the farther you get, the more challenging is the game.

It's not a very full example of what it says.\n\nHowever, for the price, it's fun and loads fast. It keeps things simple and I'm not even a sports or boxing fan, but I enjoyed it.\n\nYou get to make your own character basically, different apparal and you can do the basics of appearance change. For the price the fighting is good and the AI isn't bad. It's not a button masher, but if you wear the opponent down you can hook over and over til they are down, and it makes sense.\n\nButton mashing before wearing them down will not help, unless you are grossly overstatted above the opponent. Or above, them being worn down and too tired.\n\nMy main complaint is after doing the three championships I have in interest in playing.

The regular price for this game is presently $4.99, which is quite reasonable.\n\n---PROS---\n+Pretty good graphics\n+Game has a pretty good feel to it.\n+The presentation of the game seems pretty good.\n+You can create your own player, train him, and progress through career mode.\n+There is a quick fight option as well.\n+The game runs pretty smooth on fairly low/med specs. My computer has a 1.3Ghz dual core AMD and 8 GB ram. Despite the high ram, the CPU is usually my bottleneck. However, It ran well on default graphics settings.\n\n---CONS---\n-I've read that the career mode can be easily defeated pretty quickly, leaving a bit to be desired.\n-The game gives you very few choices to create your player without having to "buy" new shorts, mustaches, haircuts, etc with in-game currency. I don't think it works like in-app purchases, but you have to earn this currency by winning fights. It makes the game feel a bit like a free-to-play smart phone game. Personally, I feel that in game currencies should only be needed to buy signficant things... not stuff that should be standard, like a certain haircut for your customized character.\n\nAll in all, this seems to be a fun game.

Just the right length if it goes the distance)\n\nCons:\n-Ring girls move as if devs have never seen a woman walk before, only read about it in books (also, round card is 50% too small. This bothers me way more than it should)\n-Hard to string together combos when opponent is dazed. I move in for the kill and he's recovered and I'm out of stamina\n-Judges are inconsistent and would drive Teddy Atlas to apoplexy\n\nSummary:\nRemember Buster Douglas Knock-Out Boxing for the Genesis?

It is weird, because even if you knock them down 5 times within 20 seconds, they still get up. Our player can get knocked down twice at most...

This can only mean that the game was so flawed that there was nothing I could do but give it a miss and not feel guilty that it was being put on the backburner...permanently.\n\nWhy?\n\nInitially I had trouble understanding how the game worked because I don't really watch boxing, nor do I ever play it in real life or in the virtual World, even though I personaly have thrown a punch or two during a pub crawl. So because I only knew the basics of boxing, it should really have meant that I would struggle in a game happily named "Real Boxing", but alas here is where I ran into quite a big problem.\n\nSince I was a huge novice, as expected I lost my first two matches because I was doing what I thought was "real" boxing. That was to try and "mix it up" and jab a couple of times, then try a much more potent move, wowing the crowd with a powerful KO. Instead every match seemed rather tame and while they were close affairs, I could not buy a win and quite honestly things were going as expected.\n\nDuring my first three career matches, I had lost two games on points and the last had ended as a draw but things were about to change...drastically. In the game I got myself a draw, I noticed I didn't have to throw so many varied punches, but just throw one particular punch, a jab - then back off a little to recover my stamina. It was a cue that I would definitely bring into my upcoming fourth match where I decided to roll with this uninspring but effecive style of boxing and went back to the ring seeking revenge with my new jabbing prowess...\n\nIn my fourth match all I threw were jabs, and did so with devastating results. I got the combo count to about 3 or 4 then as my stamina wore down, I backed off and let it recover and then I just went back in and hit left and right handed jabs again and again. After each round I had landed about 40 to 60 punches and my adversary had a mere 5 to 15 each time. At the end of the match, I had a resounding unanimous victory.\n\nI then went to the gym and put all my winnings into my boxers speed and also completed the mini games which were available. After 4 matches my speed was something around 70 and by 3 hours played, it had hit the 80 mark. I had a quick footed boxer, with fleeting punches ready to lightly jab into any boxers face as if he were putting on powder with a puffy makeup brush. It was a heavily feminine style of play, but it was effective - and I was tempted to call my boxer Blue Steel.\n\nI won every single match with complete ease, all the way to the title belt!\n\nYes you read that right...! Even though I started with two defeats and a draw, I won match after match thereafter to become the champion. So I went up a division and again put all my coins into speed and again with the same boxing style I won fight after fight all the way until I hit the uninstall button on the game.\n\nThis game has a lot of fighting mechanics, but you don't need any of them. You don't need uppercuts, haymakers, strength, perks, hugging or whatever it is called when you take a nap on the other boxer, etc etc etc.\n\nYou just jab and run away, and inevitably win - which some how reminded me of World of Warcraft back in 2006 when I used to "dot and run" with my Warlock. If you don't know what that means, then you know exactly how I felt when I first started playing this game - clueless. Yet at the end you feel like a champion and it's not because you are good, it is because the game is completely flawed.\n\nRather than kid myself that I indeed was a "real" boxer, I inevitably preferred to uninstall the game. I knew I was nothing but a jabbing phoney and I just could not bring myself to win the career mode knowing that.  Who want's to be the Lance Armstrong of boxing?\n\nI know I didn't.\n\nI give this game an F, or 2 out of 10.","February 28, 2015","false","3.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","4"

The announcer is hilariously obnoxious. I really wish there was more and better boxer customization. There is no real variation in frame or facial structure. I can't play a slick, wiry bantamweight that looks like Rigondeaux - I have to look like competition-fit Kai Greene, with my choice of gear, facial features, and skin colour. You'd think that with how much variation there is in the build, height, and reach of boxers, it would at least be addressed in the game. But nope, every boxer uses the same re-skinned model.\n\nGraphical gripes aside, when I actually play it as I believe it was intended, Real Boxing is such a fun game.

If you choose, every fight can be a chess match, with specific punches chosen to counter whatever they throw, fun and rewarding micro with timing headslips, and a range system that ends up modeling boxing footwork fairly well.\n\nUnfortunately, aspects of the game are broken -the stamina system and the stun / combo mechanic. These mechanics are supposed to reward skilled play; ideally you go in to trade 3 or 4 accurate and carefully chosen punches, then cover up and get back out of range. Unfortunately it is vastly more efficient to select the right perks and run forward while repeatedly jabbing your opponent to unconsciousness. Run at them, jab the guard until it breaks, jab them while they're stunned. Rinse, repeat. Boring.\n\nThere is multiplayer and I have not yet dared. Who knows though, maybe amist all the cheese and jab spam, something resembling Real Boxing might happen.","December 11, 2015","true","12.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I’ve never played “Fight Night” (I don’t own a console), but I’ve played many others over the years (all the way back to Atari 2600 boxing!). From my perspective, “Real Boxing” is the real deal, a legitimate boxing game that’s exciting and involving.\n\nIf you’re a boxing purist like myself, however, you will notice some missing elements of actual boxing, and some aspects are quite unrealistic. I’ll list the CONS of the game first:\n\nCONS:\n-  no body attacks. That is, no punches at all to the midsection (stomach, below the belt, etc.) This is an entirely head-hunting game.\n\n- the controls are a bit awkward, no matter which option you choose (keyboard/mouse, joystick, etc.)  It will take some getting used to.\n\n- Opponents all fight in the same style, with only their stats (strength, stamina, and speed) making the difference in difficulty.\n\n-  the “clinching” system is frustrating and unrealistic. It’s a button-mashing exercise that can last the entire round! No ref will break it up. And usually, you will lose the clinch game against the computer opponent.\n\n- There’s no three-knockdown rule. I’ve battered opponents who’ve gotten up from knockdowns five times in one round!\n\n- Once you’ve won all three champoinship tournaments, there’s little incentive to keep playing the single player mode. You've beaten the game.\n\n- In multiplayer mode, you’ll get massacred by other players online!!!\n\nPROS:\n\n-  The action is fast-paced, tense, and suitably tactical. Keep your guard up! Jab, stick, and move!\n\n- The graphics are quite good. Not “Fight Night,” but still very attractive and well-animated.\n\n- You feel like you’re boxing! (Once you get past the “no body shots” limitation).\n\n- The training mini-games are effective, if a little frustrating at times.\n\n- You can't just blast through the game without building up you're stats over time. You will have to take on some lesser "quick fight" opponents to gain enough ring experience (and stats). Otherwise, "career" opponents will demolish you.\n\n\nOverall, this is a very fun (if a bit limited) boxing game. As many others have said, it isn’t “Fight Night,” but for the price, you’ll get your money’s worth out of this game, especially if you get it on sale or in a bundle.\n","December 25, 2014","true","23.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

My only real fault with the game is it's clunky as crap sometimes. You can dodge an incoming punch, but the movement is sometimes too clunky for you to move in and counter in time. Fight Night (my favourite boxing game franchise, so naturally my go-to comparison, I make no apologies) offered very fluid controls, this feels much heavier and .. well just heavy, and I felt like I was moving on a grid (like the original tomb raider, you know what I mean), it really broke immersion and I never felt I was fully in control of my guy.\nThat said, very satisfying to KO folk. It's interesting though, the fewer rounds you set it to play as, the more damage you'll do. My first match I set to 15 rounds, and I ended up going the distance without getting the opponent's health bar down halfway. Set it to three hours, however, and you'll get two KOs per round easily. For the best balance of realism and arcade brawler I guess go with ten rounds.\nMinigames to level up your boxer are repetitive but more difficulty is added to these too as you go through the escalating boxing tournaments, which was a pleasant surprise that caught me off-guard. Sadly, these involve not just the buttons but the analogue sticks, and I often screwed up because I find it difficult to judge an angle to aim the stick at, so when it wanted the right stick to go up to the right at 45 degrees, I often missed it by going too far 90 degrees, or vice versa, which was frustrating and felt like a cheap fail.\nIn lieu of more polished boxing sim alternatives this will serve well enough, but it could use a bit of polish. More variety in unlocks wouldn't go amiss either, the gear and especially the hair and stuff is far too limited, and you stand a good chance of fighting a clone of yourself, which is amusing but kinda weird :P","October 31, 2014","true","5.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

The graphics are great. The character creation is limited which is understandable considering this is not a AAA game. It has a decent career mode and training to impove your stats. It has a shop menu where you can buy items like boxing gloves, shorts and shoes. An excellent feature are the Perks which you can customize depending on your playstyle (e.g. lower stamina drain from hooks)\n\nAs i said earlier, it has the basic boxing mechanics which makes the gameplay repetitive especially when you're up against tougher opponents which takes a longer time to defeat and having to do the same combo or dodging becomes boring. Because of this you can't develop a deeper and adaptive play style of being an in-fighter, out-fighter or a mixture of both. It could add powered punches (haymakers), step-in/out, side steps, specifics blocks and feints to remedy its limited boxing mechanics. Also the footwork in the game is not smooth and sometimes frustrating.","December 17, 2014","true","10.6"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Not that strategic, but fun semi arcade boxing.\n\nCombat its simple, 6 different buttons to hit (jab, hook, uppercut) x 2 hands, thats for the headshots, you have to press an aditional button to land it on the body. One tap of a button to dodge an incoming hit, keep pressing for a block.\nIf you dodge a punch succesfully, you regain some stamina and the game gets into slowmo, allowing you to counter attack, but the AI can also dodge and counter, so you can get some really nice chains in slowmo.\n\nYou do not block specific parts of your body, its automagical, and not so strategic.\n\nAnd thats about it about the combat, not that complicated to start trowing some punches at the IA. Its decent enough, when you start, but then income the problems.\n\nWhen you start, you have about the same stats than your opponents. Your punches look and seem powerful, they do damage, though you can only hit 2-3 times since you will drain all your stamina, you have to wait to fill it again (few seconds without receiving hits or dodging a punch). After a couple fights, you will get some quick wins.\n\nBut the scaling is terribly. You cannot train whenever you want or have cash for it, this only happens every few fights\nand you can only train once per stat. If you have leftover money, you can pay for the increase of each stat (what?).\n\nOnce you finish your first tournament, the stat difference becomes abysmal. You do virtually no damage, while your opponent hits a jab and does like 5 times the damage you did with a perfectly timed uppercut. Stamina wise is about the same, you can throw 4-5 punches now, but they can throw a flurry of punches. And unlike you, when you are hitting your opponent with a combination, they do regen stamina.\n\nSo at this point you practically are negated a KO fight (seriously, your opponent ends 100% hp every single fight) you do have to box and win by desition, so it gets boring real quick.\n\nTraining itself its boring as well. you just have to press a button at the right time, each training its about the same as the other one, the only difference its the pace at you have to press the buttons.\n\nIf you are a fan of boxing, well, you have like 1hr gameplay on this one. If you have tolerance for boring fights, then prepare yourself, you will hit with wet noodles and have to win most fights by desition (unless you want to make some grinding in already won tournaments).","September 1, 2015","true","7.7"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

On one hand, I want to recommend it as I have had a bit of fun with it. But on the other hand, there are a few things that keep me from whole heartedly recommending it. The graphics are good enough and the animation is fine.  The customization of your fighter, although limited, is a nice touch.\nThe gameplay though, drags down the score. The hit detection is not refined. I counter attack and miss about half the time. I stand in front of my opponent and jab, but wait, he didn't move and neither did I, yet I didn't even touch him. I try to move backwards to regain stamina but instead I move up or down. I attempt to dodge, but the button didn't register, again. I have a hard time with a fighter, go back and fight easier opponents, train then go back and knock him out first round. Yeah, that's realistic. The leveling up system is kind of broken. I have ideas on how to improve it, but let's face it, I'm not a developer, my "improvements" might just break the game.\nBut don't let all these negative comments drive you off. It can be fun. When it is an actual battle and you win by unanimous decision, it's  a great feeling. Or if you are taking on someone who has better stats than you, somehow play it smart and end up knocking them out in the third round with only a blip of health left, it is rewarding. The game does the feeling of the fights right, the atmosphere, it just falls short in the gameplay department.\nIt has so much potential, but potential that is ultimately being wasted unless the developer picks it up again. It's time for the developer to get out of the corner, listen to your trainer and then give it one more go. With a few improvements, this game would be a great title and worth well more than the 4.99 that I picked it up for.\nGive it a shot if you're a boxing fan, but don't expect too much out of it. On the plus side, it is a great excuse to listen to some Dropkick Murphys .","May 12","true","8.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The gameplay ? well almost no mobility for the characters, only one block move (which block EVERYTHING until you block 3 hits and then you are block breaked) for 12 hits you can use. But the range of the blow is weird at best. Sometime your char does'nt even try to get close while hitting. In the same trend you can counter the ennemy. (you can even perma dodge until you get a counter chance -_-' ) But what happened after this counter is that 70% of time you can't even reach the stunned opponnent standing helplessly behind you ! (but you can use your stamina in the attempt).\nOh and I almost forgot => the win can be managed with jabs ONLY. And I must say that those jabs are almost as much deadly as hooks or upper, but way fasters and they interrupts ennemy attacks pretty much all the time.\nLast point to gameplay the training, it's a king in hid kind, it's like dance dance revolution, except it's slow, and only move harder with the number of buttons, so it's still dull, yet "harder"...\nIf the game were to be "ready to rumble (PC edition)" it would be great, but as it stand "real boxing" is a big ♥♥♥♥♥♥ lie.

It's like someone having the right idea on how to make a cake and was on the right track until they f'd up the mix or burnt it. - Get it when it's on sale if you got about 4 hours to spend.\n\nI quite like the controls and the graphics are good enough but I do feel that a lot of stuff was missing considering it's a boxing game with the title """REAL"" Boxing" because there's really not a lot to this other than "Fight five times. Do your strength, stamina and speed training. Buy some strength, speed or stamina" rinse and repeat.\n\n\nWEIGHT DIVISIONS ARE MISSING:\nMy first problem with the game is that there's no weight classes so i'm just assuming because a lot of punching is power punching, all it of it is Heavyweight. Weight divisions can change the game because you can be with the sluggish but powerful Heavyweights or be a light footed, fast moving Flyweight but no, you're just left to a one weight class set.\n\nTRAINING:\nThis actually did annoy me a bit because they were on the right track and I really liked the training mini-games but you've only got three\n\nStrength, speed and stamina.\n\nIt's like "come on, have some variety guys" Endurance, practice moves to improve them.\n\n\nIT'S A NO-BRAINER:\nGo in and box, that's all your career is. Where's the management? There's no schedule and you don't really do anything in your career. Fight 8 times, have a championship match and "oh, do you want this one deal? yes/no?" and whatever you choose, it really doesn't have an effect on anything you do or have done; one choice gives you money, the other doesn't.\n\nI would have like to have seen an injury system so you have to be careful booking fights and being IN fights otherwise it can end your career early. A schedule calendar where you can book fights, manage signings for a new brand of boxing gear, attending a sport convention, accepting or declining movie/tv deals which effects your career time and a reputation meter so say you can choose to slag someone off on social media and that will get you bad rep or have post-fight decisions like "shake his hand" or "talk trash" which can lead you to being a good sport or a prick everyone boos at. Now I know that's being REALLY nit-picky because even big combat sport video games like Fight Night and UFC don't have a rep meter but with something called "Real Boxing" it would have been nice to see.\n\n\nCUSTOMIZATION:\nYou can’t even change the name of your fighter. The hell? Your choice of boxing gear is very limited and because credits can be used on training you’re most likely to forget it exists because each item is like 500 credits so you’d rather spend it on training. To cut long story short: It doesn’t have create a fighter on it and also you can’t even edit the gear.\n\n\n\nSo all I can say from this is: “It’s nice for it being a short game but the title was too bold a statement and there wasn’t much in the game so you’re best just getting it on sale when it’s like £1-£2.something”","April 7, 2015","true","7.6"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

The game reminds me of Ring Kings and Fight Night from the PS2. The game plays very similar to the two mentioned games. You throw punches with the right stick or buttons if you use a controller(Works seemlessly with Xbox 360 controller for me). Guard, block and duck are as you expect.\nWhere the game falls short is the massive amounts of self promotion from the developer. Everything is tagged with the dev's name and logo. All the trunks and gloves have the logo. The ring and padding has the logo, well, it is everywhere. The game has little to no customization, just boots, gloves, trunks, hair(beard, mustache and head) and tattoes. All of which are very little. The skills are as you'd expect for a game like the above mentioned. You train every 5 fights. When you loose, you train a bit and fight again if you have the credits. But, if you need a scratch itched for something you play 5 years ago, it will work.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kr3m/recommended/296770/","kr3m","Kr3m","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kr3m/","2323 products in account","I have to say I have mixed feelings about this game.  It's a fun game if you're just looking to fill a few hours for $5, but you really can't expect much beyond that.  The AI is predictable and easy and there doesn't seem to be much variation from one boxer to the next.  The challenge does get tighter as you move up in the tournaments, but if you decide to restart tournaments that you've already won, you can grind your way to the top skills very easily and completely decimate the AI.\n\nThis game has a lot of potential.  Unfortunately, the lack of players online makes what could be a decent MP boxing game a rather short and less than stellar single player game in career mode.  While, I'm sure it would be more rewarding to not grind it out and actually beat the game in succession, there just doesn't seem to be much of a point unless you want to balance out the challenge and perhaps bother collecting all of the achievements.\n\nDespite all of this, I did have fun even despite the grind for 7 hours which isn't bad considering the $5 price tag.  While, I do wish there were more players online and a more varied single player career mode, I can't say this isn't worth buying or playing because it is.\n\nIn conclusion, I am in fact recommending this game especially at its current price.  I would definitely be willing to pay $20 for a more polished sequel with better AI and more players to take advantage of the multiplayer mode.","June 27, 2015","true","7.2"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Waste of $8 wish steam offered refunds for abandoned projects and 1/4 finished games.\n\nInteraction:\nWas hoping for a game like EA fight night where dodging and blocking as well as good combos would win the day (i.e. skill). Dodge is the same button as block, press to dodge (i.e. tap spam) and hold to block (i.e. wtf i pressed dodge not block... oh you gotta tap spam to dodge). Took me about 30 matches before i figured out how dodging worked. Even after I figured it out, it's not interactive. You dont dodge incoming blows, you predict them before any form of movement has ensued.\n\nApparently this is a mobile app port, makes sense as playing on PC you can't react to anything in real time as i explained above. Its like a dance simulator except minus the visual cue's. If you react while a punch is being thrown its too late. You need to react before the punch is being thrown, like some form of anticipatory foreplay. This made me really sad as it removed all tactical gameplay.\n\nGameplay:\nSo playing through single player, you will notice STATS MEAN EVERYTHING.\n\nThere are 3 main stats (ikr way to many to manage :P) Strength ((how much damage you do, opponents strength stat affects this) ie. 100% strength will do way more damage vs 68% strength than 92%)\n\nStamina ((how quickly you gas out) doesn't really affect ♥♥♥♥ as even with max stamina vs low stamina you can only throw 3-4 punches before being gassed, it only really affects recovery speed in a high vs low stat (like strength as above))\n\nand speed (who hits first) this doesnt really affect much either as i will explain later. Doesnt matter who hits 1st unless its against high level bots who can dodge like it has its own button :P\n\nFor instance you can have better Stamina and speed yet be losing by 3 points of strength, the person you are fighting will hit you and do 3 to 6 times as much damage (ie. 10 vs 30 or 60 damage). even though you are hitting 1st and more times.\n\nPunching doesn't involve any tactics either, as there is a generic high block and no real dodge function. So if you both swing both will hit (depending on punch choice), then it comes down to stamina or strength. i.e. Who can punch for longer or who hits harder. So if you have more speed and stamina you can do 1 more hit at less damage against someone who does more damage in less hits with strength i.e. as above ^\n\nSo playing through all the single player if you just level up before proceeding you can come out and 1st round KO everyone by just swinging then block recover stamina and swing (rinse and repeat)\n\nCharacter development:\nAs stated stats progession is the main point of the game. If you try to play through the game and do the minigames every 5 matches you will have a bad time. Mainly because the minigames are horrible. You are better off just restarting the tournaments and buying all your stats with the cash winnings.\n\nCharacter creation:\nYou can choose between about 8 premade characters and where you are from and your name. Def next level for a mobile 99 cent app port.\n\nMultiplayer:\nfinished the game, decided to try multiplayer got some poor guy without 100% stats. Noticed a lot of lag and blackscreen between the knockdown screens i.e. 3-4 seconds. Also noticed a lot of delay, so im guessing matchmaking isnt done on ping.\n\nAll in All:\nWasn't impressed, the game offered no challenge and when it did (i.e. understats vs higher levels) the lack of an effective counter (i.e. dodge) really made it a pushing isht uphill problem. I actually like playing fightnight against way OP opponents as you could still dodge and outskill them, This game offers none of that depth. Its a 3d SNES port of mike tysons punchout.\n\n","July 7, 2014","false","2.8"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","1"

Does it have depth not really, does it have customization slightly,\n\nHowever this game is the only choice for a boxing game on PC.  If this game was $60 or even $20 I would not recommend it, since the game is only $5 and is the only boxing game available on PC I can't really think of a reason to not recommend it.  My best advice if you get this game is play with a controller, I use a wireless Xbox 360 controller and the setup allows you to either use the right thumbstick and/or buttons to throw your punches.  This game can be slow if you don't watch your staminia.  It involves alot of going in throwing 3-5 punches putting up your guard and pulling back,  If you play your cards right in a match you can however pin your oppenent towards the corner or the ropes and throw a series of shots to the body.  This game can provide several hours of fun if you like boxing, use a controller, and take the time to learn the mechanics of it. Again for $5 you can't really beat it considering it is the only option for boxing.","August 19, 2015","true","5.8"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

The controls (I use an x box controller for it) are quite good, pretty sharp and intuitive, the graphics are decent and I didn't experience any of the stuttering or sluggishness some others reported. The important thing is to not expect the detail and depth of a AAA sports title like Madden or the Show. Boxer customization is perfunctory at best and everyone ends up looking pretty much identical no matter what you do. Game play is a little light, as career mode and random fights (which don't count toward your career) are really all there is to do. Training minigames are nice enough but shallow. If they had managed to make a deep, customizable experience this would be a legitmately excellent game, but as it is it's a nice bit of boxing for pretty cheap.  And hey, maybe supporting something like this will create interest in a full fledged boxing game.

It's not Good enough and thanks for attempting to make a boxing game for the PC. And what's up with the lady with no emotions at all at the end of the bout clapping but her face is somewhat stoned. The controls were clunky and not as accurate when you are button mashing with it. Also the v-sync is horrible you can still notice them even if it was off I was playing this on the big 50" 1080p screen. This is the second game that I was really dissappointed with the purchase. The game was there but come on! this is a next gen we need a next gen graphics for goodness sake.","July 4, 2014","false","0.3"," 4 of 14 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","4","14","0","0"

Controls are a bit flighty on xb360 pad with it's use of analogue stick for throwing punches (can slip to wrong punch types too easily I felt). Had 6 matches in multiplayer vs a friend and noticed i was KO'ing my friend in 30 seconds despite my fighter having inferior stats etc, so dunno if that's netcode related or just bad mechanics in general, fights should be a lot longer endurance even early on, I suppose at the price it's to be expected however.","July 3, 2014","false","0.7"," 4 of 17 people (24%) found this review helpful","24","4","17","0","1"
