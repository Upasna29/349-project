The original Arcade version with the cabinet design and the new remake Rebooted version.\nBoth are great and easy to get used to.\nThe game works fine with the Keyboard and mouse and also with a 360 controller.\n\nSo what's new here?\nPros:\nThe Rebooted version offers updated graphics with new level design and new challenges and Steam achievements.\nYou can unlock new characters, each cost a certain amount of gems that you can find throughout the game.\n\nCons:\nThe repetitive soundtrack in the Rebooted version, hearing it over and over in each level. It would have been nice for a variety of soundtracks. And as far as I see there are no audio options to raise and lower the in-game music volume so you can't play your own background music. :(\n\nBut still for $5 USD, you can't go wrong. It's a great game and an awesome classic. :D","July 8, 2014","true","1.8"," 73 of 84 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","73","84","0","3"

It's not even bad as a Q*Bert game! It's got the whole original arcade Q*Bert in here! Here is why I don't:\n\nIt controls like crap and it makes you grind.\n\nI'm not talking about the gems, even, which you collect here and there to unlock different skins for Q*Bert. Those are silly and a harmless bonus. It's the stars. See, when you begin a set of stages, you see three objectives. "Complete the stage", "Complete the stage under (time)", and "Complete the stage with (score)". Finish one of them and you get a star, it shows you on the stage select screen how many of the 3 you have on each stage, and how many you have overall.\n\nYou need to have X stars to continue on at various points. You will not have X stars if you just beat each world. This is not a problem if you're talented, EXCEPT... you only get one star per run at the world. You can hit all three goals, and it does not care - you're going to have to play it three times for three stars. So you're stuck re-running stages you've beaten already and it becomes a real chore. These gates are pretty regular! There are 5 out of a 36 stage map. I got to the second and went "I'm out".\n\nThe other problem: this game uses the mouse to control Q*Bert. Only the mouse. If there is any other single button or input option, I never found it/got it to respond. It ALMOST makes sense, because of the isometric perspective + hex-based structures in the game, except for the fact that it's just such a pain to have to trundle around with clickclickclickclickclick. You can't even hold the button to make him follow. This will also apply in the emulated "Classic" mode, too, so don't think you're free of that there. (edit: I have since discovered that somehow, the base installation came with the buttons unset for me. There is in fact a keyboard control scheme/way to make him follow a held mouse, even if you have to close the game and reset it to activate it - no in-game options screen at all. The latter is super-risky if he misinterprets which way you're pointing and flies into the void, but this gripe is something I was wrong about and I leave the proof of my idiocy here.)\n\nBottom line is, the game as a whole is way over the line past "acceptably janky" into "it all works, but it works WRONG" territory. Please don't buy this.","July 18, 2014","false","1.9"," 72 of 96 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","72","96","0","0"

How wrong I was.\n\nThe problems begin with the classic version. Why they didn't just emulate the original ROMs when they hold the rights to the game is bewildering. Instead what we're given is a poorly programmed mess of a port that gets many things wrong. Two-thirds of the sound effects are missing. Ugg and Wrong Way are completely silent, as are Slick and Sam, who also don't revert the colours on the cubes (and sometimes change the cubes to the RIGHT colour instead). No ditty plays when you collect the green ball that freezes the board. The game sometimes continues to move enemies after you've cleared a stage. The unused discs don't score any bonus points when you clear a level, instead of the 50 bonus points x level you should get.\n\nAs for the Rebooted part, it is one huge cluster as well. The hexagon pattern removes the difficulty and strategy of trying to clear the bottom corners of the level. Other than the resolution, nothing graphically stands out. The level music and the map music often play at the same time. Q*bert only has the one voice sample and it seems to play randomly instead of when he gets hit. The music is MIDI quality at best and elevator quality at worst.\n\nSteer well clear of this reboot. Not even nostalgia goggles can protect you from this crummy game.","July 8, 2014","false","2.0"," 66 of 90 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","66","90","0","0"

Even the 8-bit Nintendo version had continues making it superior to the PC version, its another example of a PC port where oddly the free legal online versions using java emulating the arcade game are superior to actually buying the game.  Such a core underlying principal of game design should be PLAYING the game, somehow if you buy this your limited to playtime, this happened one of the Metal SLug games only letting you have 20 credits where the legal online free versions offer unlimited continues.\n\nUsing a controller the controls feel delayed, this is a game of speed and precision like most games, but when moving somewhere it feels like the game takes a second to detect it then move the character, this results in death, which results in no fun since dying over and over due to the game being unplayable sucks.\n\nThe rebooted side is interesting with a map and all that but its classic qbert, a fun game but done wrong in this PC port.  Why bother making a game if they dont want us to play it?  Such an odd idea to just crank out code because people can to make a game then forgetting people may want to play that game.  This game gives the feeling that people just knew how to put code together to make a game but had no clue how to make it playable, also visible in the sort of wonky controller support where you cant exit the game without using the mouse or keyboard, meaning it can require up to 3 peripherals to play  Qbert, why not 4 or 5 maybe VR goggles.  Keep in mind the original qbert just had a joystick, not one button, yet this game requires three peripherals, figure that math out...\n\nWorth one quarter, the arcade equivalent since that is what a person would spend before walking away from this abomination.\nRating:  4/10  Value:  $0.25","November 18, 2014","false","0.4"," 22 of 34 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","22","34","0","0"

But I only played one round of the classic version because I suck lol.\n\nAnyway the rebooted version look's good especially in comparison to the original game. It's got some nice if repetitive happy music.\n\nYou have to change the colours of all the tiles by hopping Q*bert on to them. He's supposed to have OCD or something like that haha. Enemies are spawned to try and stop you such as the rolling red ball and the bouncing purple snake. The rebooted version has challenges you can complete each stage in order to earn more stars. The classic version is appears to simply be just that the original game from the 80's or whenever.\n\nThe reboot version is relatively easy. At least to get 1 star ratings on the first 6 levels which I’ve completed. Your progress to later levels appears to be blocked until you have earned a certain amount of stars. So it look's like you need to do better than bare minimum 1 star rating i.e. more than just finish the level. This would mean repeating levels which could be a little bit annoying but it's better than starting all over again from the first stage I guess. The classic version doesn't seem to be as user friendly e.g. there is no warning when enemies drop down so I found myself jumping onto squares and before I knew it an enemy spawned and squashed me.\n\nAnyway the game is fun, so far lol. There are like 50-60 levels in the rebooted version each with challenges to complete. So I'd say you can probably get your moneys worth out of it.\n\nClick here for more let’s play videos =)","July 7, 2014","true","2.3"," 25 of 41 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","25","41","0","0"

The classic Q*Bert insallment of this game is essentially the same as it has always been, so there is no real need to comment on that further, even if you don't care for the rebooted installment, the classic is still worth buying, especially since it's really cheap in the first place.\nThe Rebooted version of the game is a mixed bag for a good number of players, but I don't have any issues with it myself. The difficulty curve is spot-on, the graphics have a great charm to them and there is a really nice variation of levels and challenges to play. It is ultimately nice and solid gameplay and I have no complaints for the price.\n\nThe main issue for this game appears to be the controller support, I personally prefer to play with the mouse controls by clicking (or holding left-click) on the cells instead, so this isn't something that effects me and thus can't comment on, but all in all, yes, I'd recommend this game, especially to retro gamers. It's a great addition to your casual game library that is a fun way to kill a couple of hours once in a while.

Is it Q*Bert at heart?   Yes.    Is it worth playing?  Yes.  Does controller support suck?   Yes.  How do you fix this?  Customize your controls in the options.  Personally, I use on my 360 controller the XYBA for precise diagonal jumping, and then the left and right shoulder buttons for up and down (there are now hexagon platforms as opposed to square cubes to jump on).   So why did they change to  hexagon platforms?  For one, it makes playing levels where the cubes would change back to their normal color a little easier than the original;  two, it allows for level designs that were not previously not possible to create.\n\nSo what are some of the flaws with the game besides the controls?   Coily has a weird jump animation.   He more slugs around then jumps.  The boxing glove enemy makes no sense.  Stay two blocks away from the glove if you want to survive.  The game seems incomplete.  I honestly don't think I was supposed to be able to beat level 36-1.  They throw so much at you that the only way to beat it is to die several times to reset the board for a second.  36-2 and 36-3 are easy as cake and once you beat 36-3, well, the game just stays there with the words "Round Complete."    It doesn't go back to the map or do anything to beat the last level.   Also, the purple gremlin and pig are gone.  Finally, if you're not playing with a mouse, wherever it is on the screen, that's the way Q*Bert will face, and it can slow your character down.\n\nWhat are the pros?  It definitely feels like Q*bert.  Even with its flaws, once the game gets busy and you've mastered the controls, it is Q*Bert.   Red balls drop, Coily chases you while you chase a treasure chest.  Sam will change boxes back to their original colors.  There's a new evil kitty enemy that I like to refer to as the Nemesis Enforcer.  It's entrance is as chilling as when you first encountered the purple gremilin and pig in the original arcade game. The evil kitty will sit there and wait for you to make a move.   Definitely my my new favorite bad guy.   I love the overworld map music.  Totally Q*Bert.\n\nOverall, it is a good Q*Bert game.   I hope they fix some of these things, especially the Coily jump animation and the mouse issue which forces Q*Bert to look in the direction of the mouse.","July 14, 2014","true","10.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I played the coin operated version 25-30 years ago so when another reviewer pointed out that a lot of the classic mechanics and sounds don't exist in this version, it made me realize some of the flaws of this version compared to the original coin op.  Knowing that, I'm still satisfied with the arcade side of this game as it offers the challenge of an old school arcade game.\n\nThe modern "Rebooted" side of this game offers much less challenge than the arcade side as the cubes that Q*Bert would normally be jumping around on, are hexigonal and give the player 6 directions instead of four. It's an interesting twist however there's very little strategy required to finish each map.  Each map offers two additional challenges that are separate from simply completing the map, which are a time challenge and a score challenge.  The time challenge is fun but doesn't offer much actual challenge. The score challenge seems to be almost impossible to fail at in the early stages as completing the map with no additional enemies killed seems to give you the exact score you need to complete this challenge.  Seems redundant.  Plus the fact that you can only go for one challenge at a time (you can't get all three challenges in one round) adds additional flakyness making these challenges seem like an afterthought. It would be nice to have some more unique challenges.\n\nThe Rebooted side also offers different characters to play as after you collect enough of those diamond things, but this is purely cosmetic.\n\nRegarding the controls, XBOX 360 wireless controller works fine with the L analog stick.  D pad doesn't appear to be an option.  A classic nuance of Q*Bert is it's controls as most of your moves are diagonal instead of up down left right so I could see it being frustrating for someone not used to this.\n\nOverall for $5 this is a great deal.  The steam trading cards are selling for quite a bit atm so that's almost an instant rebate on a pretty decent game.","July 12, 2014","true","4.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I prefer the mouse controls personally, and it works great!\n\nI never played Q*Bert in an arcade, but I've seen a few videos of it, and can say that the classic version plays pretty closely to the original. From what I can tell most of the sound effects are there, and it looks just like the original!\n\nThe new version is fun too though! It's the same basic game idea, but with a few added elements. There's gems, which you can use to buy new characters, there's stars, which are required to unlock new levels, and there's new enemies! The stars however did not recieve the best implementation they could have. You have you complete challenges to get stars, and there's 3 challenges per level. You have to play the level 3 seperate times to get them all, and get the stars for them, such as score 2000 points, or beat the level in under 1:10.\n\nThe enemies are interesting too, you have the classic ones all in a new style, and then you have the new ones. One is a boxing glove that punches you away, it feels a tad random when it punches you, but it's still a good enemy (frustrating though!). The next is a treasure that you chase around, I believe if you catch it you get 70 gems but I could be wrong.\n\nThe levels in the rebooted version get extremely hard (at least for me) later on. I'm still having fun though.\n\nThe final thing is the achievements, while I like collecting achievements for games, I feel like in this one it's random. I earned the achievement for winning the rebooted version even though I didn't beat it quite yet, the same happened for collecting all the characters.\n\nThis is a pretty good game for what it is though.

It's not too great of a port. If you really want an authentic one, buy another game collection featuring the game or get a rom for MAME. (You're on your own for that one.

If you're like me, and enjoy simple games once in a while between bigger ones, then I'd say go for it. The only flaws I can think of are the settings that you can only change before starting the game, the 2 tracks of music that never stop playing, and Q*Bert incessantly making his "swear" noise randomly during gameplay. Otherwise, I don't think it's too bad of a purchase if you like these sort of games.\n\nI mean, even if you don't like it, it's only 5 bucks, and you can just get idle to get the game's trading cards (currently selling at almost a dollar) and sell them to get a game you like better, so don't whine too much.","July 17, 2014","true","2.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Which luckly comes packaged with this game. The Orignal plays much like the arcade version i played when i was a kid,quick and fluent. The Reboot then also trys to get a grip on the older version while maintaing a newer "feel" to this classic. At first glance this is already a rebooted classic,that's done well. The reboot offers different characters to play as,in which the orignal different. The reboot also offers not just Squares but using a hexagon form to it. Would recommend this to anyone who has played the orignal and loved it and also i recommend this to new players to this game, which will end up being a instant classic in anyones heart. 10/10","February 24, 2015","true","1.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","3"

Q-Bert two ways.\n\nFirstly, the original version of Q-bert is just the way it was released long ago.  Pyramid playing field, 2D old style pixel graphics, and of course the same cast of characters.  This game is real easy to play with a gamepad.  Diagonal movement works by jumping on the pyramid just as you see on the screen...diagonally.  Sounds simple but I've seen versions of Q-bert where you had to turn the controller slightly diagonal to get that jumping diagonal feel but not this game.\n\nIf you're not familiar with Q-Bert, the object of Q-Bert is to turn the colors of each tile you jump upon to a target color.  You're on a pyramid and need to jump on the steps of the pyramid to move along and change the tile colors.  As you complete each screen the game will progressively move you through levels that make the target color harder to get to (IE: early on you change one color to another while higher levels may have you going through five colors just to get to the target color).  NPC's (Non Player Characters) try and stop you from accomplishing your goal but there's bonus ball drops that do things such as "freeze" the playing field along with NPC's allowing Q-Bert to move without a problem when you collect the ball that has dropped. Q-Bert plays just as it was played back in the day.\n\nSecondy, the rebooted version is like an updated version of the game.  I'm not talking about just a graphical upgrade where it's the same old game only with better graphics.  The biggest difference is the playing field tiles.  You're no longer on just a Pyramid.  The playing field has you on hexagons where you can jump straight up and down the playing field. Structures that are made with hexagons enable a vast array of playing fields to play on.  In the 'rebooted' version you're also given the choice of playing different Q-Bert type characters. The same old cast of NPC's like "Coily" have been updated to modern graphics as well.\n\nGreat Reboot of the game.  The game is cheap enough... but it does go on sale... so buy it on sale like I did.","July 28, 2014","true","7.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/icedus/recommended/285960/","icedus","Icedus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/icedus/","306 products in account","Now, I know what you're thinking.  "F--- yes¹, Q*Bert's momentum is still going strong after his appearance in Wreck-It Ralph, the greatest anything in the history of everything.  Here is a modern update that will do the original arcade game justice and also get me in with the JonTrons and the Jessie Rogerses of the world.  We'll all go out together for strawberry malts and talk about how Square Enix be cray-cray."\n\nBut alas, it is with a heavy heart that I write this review.  I, foolish squanderer of $5-something, am duty-bound to warn you that getting the attention of the JonTrons and the Jessie Rogerses of the world just isn't that simple.  And also that Q*Bert: Rebooted sort of capsizes itself in the modernization process.\n\nIf you dive in, Xbox 360 controller blazing, you'll notice pretty quickly that the game only kind of supports controllers.  Rebooted was clearly designed with mobile devices the mouse in mind, as it's the only way you can navigate the menus and get anything done outside of the panel-hopping you so eagerly seek.  The main event makes a strong case for going mouse-only; the analog stick is an option, but it's pretty janky.  Simultaneously forgetful and unforgiving, the controls weren't above tossing me a cardinal increment off from the direction I pushed from time to time, making me miss an angled (more angled?) jump or outright tossing me into the abyss.  Not even the included original version is spared from this madness.  Home interpretations of the arcade game's controls have varied wildly over the years, but this one takes the cake.  The bad cake with coconut shavings that gives you indigestion.\n\nYou know how to play Q*Bert.  The original game is that, but with bad controls.  But the titular Rebooted half of the package?  Hooboy.  After jumping right in to the first world, all of which are dotted with three stars indicating objectives just like mobile games, you'll be drip-fed the mechanics of the game, one per stage just like mobile games, before being let loose to hop on panels and collect gems for unlocking such enticing character reskins as Q*Bert in Armor and Girl Q*Bert.  When I say "let loose," I only mean until you hit a star wall and are forced to double back to clear more objectives in previous levels this was totally not a mobile port crapped out on Steam, why would you even think that.  It wouldn't hurt if the levels weren't so samey, from the plain background to the barely-different stages.  It's an inherent part of the design of the source material, which was part of its charm (and possibly technological limitations at the time), but the simple design doesn't work at all in tandem with this gameplay structure, the most infamous of phone-ins for the illusion of replay value.\n\nSound-wise, the reboot is legitimately obnoxious.  Everything that makes a noise just makes the one sound, a frankly impressive step down from the (small) variety the characters had to them in the original game 20+ years ago.  The one short song that loops during all the stages plays Q*Bert's most famous exclamation (you know the one, it sounds like "ECKSFEEAHZEEDAYWAYAH") over and over again.  No music at all would've been preferable.\n\nIt's a real shame the game turned out the way it is which, coincidentally, is how many mobile games turn out; the modern Q*Bert is aesthetically pleasing, with cartoony jumping and death animations.  They'd look great in a more vibrant world, one comprised of something even marginally more substantial than polygonal pyramids in black space.  But for all the advances gaming has made since 1982, it seems poor Q*Bert's still doomed to be denied proper entry into such a world.  Until he goes back and does it again with a faster time.\n\nSomeone, somewhere among the staff enjoyed having a hand in making this game.  But I didn't enjoy playing it.  And as for you?  Don't let Rebooted taint your feelings for the original.  If you have a PS3, do yourself a favor and buy the arcade game on the Playstation Store.  The controls are spot-on, and you can experience Q*Bert in all its glory with a neat arcade marquee, instead of a sad mobile... fart bee.\n\n\n¹or maybe should I say @!#?@! yes, like what Q*Bert says, ahahahahaha","August 23, 2014","false","0.6"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

Q*Bert: Rebooted unfortunately misses that mark by a wide margin.\n\nQ*Bert: Rebooted comes with two modes: Q*Bert: Classic, which is an emulation of the original arcade game, and Q*Bert: Rebooted, which is an enhanced remake of the original.  Rebooted gameplay is similar to the original, except movement can made in six different directions instead of four, making it much easier to evade enemies.  Along with a couple new enemies and the omission of Ugg and Wrong Way, the difficulty progression is very slight and very repetitive, as the same five maps are used in the progression track.  It gets only somewhat difficult near the end of the game, and when you do finish the last level, it bugs out and does not go to either an ending or credit scene.\n\nQ*Bert: Classic is still the better game, but this emulation is quite bad.  The controls are not very responsive.  The sound effects for Ugg and Wrong Way are missing. The behaviors of Sam and Slick are also incorrect.  They do not reverse the color changes that Q*Bert makes; instead they actually help Q*Bert by changing cubes to the target color.\n\nQ*Bert: Rebooted is recommended for arcade game nostalgics who don't care about quality or accuracy in their games.  You are better off finding a Q*Bert ROM to play on an arcade emulator.","July 10, 2014","false","4.2"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

You can unlock many different Q*Bert skins to add a bit of variety to an otherwise very bland experience, but most of them look just stupid.\n\nI play games to have fun, and never once did I find myself having fun.\n\nThe maps do offer some variety, but it's not enough to keep me interested.

What can I say that already hasn't been said by others?  I too was dissapointed about the controls.  They suck.  Even when you try to use a controller, there are still problems controlling the character.  The 360 Controller works fine for the classic game, but it's better to use the mouse for the Rebooted part, which is somewhat awkward.  I've NEVER played Q*bert with a mouse!  Now this is terribly important if you want to enjoy the game and FINISH IT.  Like many have mentioned, this game requires tight controls.  No one wants to die a million times because Q*bert keeps falling over the edge or keeps making the wrong turns.  It was hard enough when I played it at the arcade.  However, Nintendo did manage to do a great job of emulating the game's controls as best as they could on their console (*Super Nintendo* Q*bert 3) and I loved playing it.  Why did the developers ignore that crucial detail here?  God knows...  A true classic never goes out of style like the Que!  But this game is a slap in the face.  Although the controller is somewhat better than the mouse, and I did enjoy playing it for a while, but the poor controls are a hindrance!\n\nThe Reboot part of the game is gorgeous.  The colors are amazing, and It's cool that you can choose different characters; and that I can post a great display on my page for others to view, but that's it.  I'm not going "gaga" over it.  I never thought I would do this to Q*bert, but I'll have to give this one a thumbs down.  Thanks a lot guys...you really ruined it for us.

Sadly, it is a mess.  The controller support is spotty, though I got my xbox controller to work.  It occasionally sends me in the wrong direction, which is almost invariably fatal.  There are too many things wrong with the gameplay to compare it to the game I grew up with.  Using a disk is supposed to give you a headstart from the top, not drop a ball on you immediately.   It is also like the stingiest arcade, which gives so few free guys that I'm invariably dead by the time the game gets interesting.  WTF can't I play an easier version?  Do I need to stuff quarters in the machine?    The rebooted version of the game is a horror to play.  Instead of the traditional pyramid, there are these hexes floating in space, so almost every hex is an edge, which is always a fatal plummet when the controls can't be trusted and this weird blinking makes it hard to tell which hex I'm even on.  There can by a couple coily snakes at a time, which don't disappear when you jump to a disk.  Plus the music is more irritating than a porno soundtrack.","August 2, 2014","false","73.3"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Though I feel this is mostly because of the old Playstation version I had as a kid, but this version of Q-bert is needlesly repetitive. You might think "well yeah, It's Q-Bert" and to that I say, why not just release the original Q-Bert because honestly, that's where the most fun is as rebooted is too easy due to being small and adding new directions of jumping. Couped with the fact that you must then replay the levels twice and practically to the point of perfection makes it a real slog. And going back to classic, I honestly feel the mouse style controls aren't the greatest. Q-Bert hops in the direction of your cursor so somethimes he goes where you aren't expecting.

You had a joystick and a button that controlled your character. The skills were dependent on the game. It made for mindless entertainment that eventually expanded into the medium we hold dear. How someone thought that bringing an idea like Q*Bert into the modern era would work is beyond me.\n\nI have nothing against old classics being revived. Pac-Man: Championship Edition is a great example of modernizing a relic and making it feel brand new. Q*Bert Rebooted is not that example. Apart from mind numbing music and horrid level design, the only thing I enjoy from this reboot are the graphics.\n\nHow you can manage to mess up the control scheme to Q*Bert really boggles my mind. Gamepad support works, but barely. Often times, you'll press the diagonal direction required to make Q*Bert jump and he won't move. Other times, you'll swear you hit up or down only to have the orange puff ball jump to his demise.\n\nFor a game that is based on the idea of jumping platforms and not falling, it fails on a basic level to provide that. If I can't reliably control my character, how am I supposed to enjoy the game? For that matter, why do all the level designs recycle ad naseum until level 37?\n\nYou would be forgiven for thinking the 40 levels included in Rebooted would all be different. At first, the game mixes up the grids and keeps you guessing. It's not necessarily great, but something different that builds into new concepts is how classics like Mario can stick around.\n\nInstead, after level 8, the game just recycles everything. No new concepts, no different grid structures; there aren't even different color schemes. It makes for a slog of an experience that feels like you're re-enacting Groundhog's Day. The enemy AI is also seemingly random, which becomes infuriating in later levels.\n\nThe game also has no true ending. Once you finish, you are greeted to a screen of "Look for Upcoming Levels" and that's it. You can't even get closure on this waste of a game. I'd say the unlockable skins give you incentive, but they can all be acquired long before you finish the "last" level.\n\nTo top off everything, even the emulation of classic Q*Bert suffers from control problems. It has all the content, but Q*Bert seems to have a mind of his own when it comes to jumping. If I'm not mistaken, some of the sound effects are missing, too.\n\nReally, the only reason I bought this was because of a sale price. During the Winter Sale, I saw the game for $1. I could have done worse and paid the full price, but even my $1 feels wasted. I'd recommend steering clear at all costs. Q*Bert Rebooted is a prime example of exploited nostalgia.\n\nP.S. Be weary of the reviews on the Steam page. One is listed as IGN, but is linked to a blog post on the site. I believe that is called false advertising.\n\n2/10","May 16, 2015","false","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingsigy/recommended/285960/","kingsigy","KingSigy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingsigy/","526 products in account","Arcade games from the 1970's and 1980's were simple. You had a joystick and a button that controlled your character. The skills were dependent on the game. It made for mindless entertainment that eventually expanded into the medium we hold dear. How someone thought that bringing an idea like Q*Bert into the modern era would work is beyond me.\n\nI have nothing against old classics being revived. Pac-Man: Championship Edition is a great example of modernizing a relic and making it feel brand new. Q*Bert Rebooted is not that example. Apart from mind numbing music and horrid level design, the only thing I enjoy from this reboot are the graphics.\n\nHow you can manage to mess up the control scheme to Q*Bert really boggles my mind. Gamepad support works, but barely. Often times, you'll press the diagonal direction required to make Q*Bert jump and he won't move. Other times, you'll swear you hit up or down only to have the orange puff ball jump to his demise.\n\nFor a game that is based on the idea of jumping platforms and not falling, it fails on a basic level to provide that. If I can't reliably control my character, how am I supposed to enjoy the game? For that matter, why do all the level designs recycle ad naseum until level 37?\n\nYou would be forgiven for thinking the 40 levels included in Rebooted would all be different. At first, the game mixes up the grids and keeps you guessing. It's not necessarily great, but something different that builds into new concepts is how classics like Mario can stick around.\n\nInstead, after level 8, the game just recycles everything. No new concepts, no different grid structures; there aren't even different color schemes. It makes for a slog of an experience that feels like you're re-enacting Groundhog's Day. The enemy AI is also seemingly random, which becomes infuriating in later levels.\n\nThe game also has no true ending. Once you finish, you are greeted to a screen of "Look for Upcoming Levels" and that's it. You can't even get closure on this waste of a game. I'd say the unlockable skins give you incentive, but they can all be acquired long before you finish the "last" level.\n\nTo top off everything, even the emulation of classic Q*Bert suffers from control problems. It has all the content, but Q*Bert seems to have a mind of his own when it comes to jumping. If I'm not mistaken, some of the sound effects are missing, too.\n\nReally, the only reason I bought this was because of a sale price. During the Winter Sale, I saw the game for $1. I could have done worse and paid the full price, but even my $1 feels wasted. I'd recommend steering clear at all costs. Q*Bert Rebooted is a prime example of exploited nostalgia.\n\nP.S. Be weary of the reviews on the Steam page. One is listed as IGN, but is linked to a blog post on the site. I believe that is called false advertising.\n\n2/10","May 16, 2015","false","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I used the program joy2key in order to make it work. More on how I did it in the CON section.\n\nPRO: It's a decent update of the classic game. The progression system is good and it includes both the classic arcade game and a modern update. I can see why other people could be turned off from this game's presentation since it is basically the same as you'd see on an iPhone or Android device, 3 star ratings included. But for something like Q*Bert you don't really want anything too complex and the system they have in place does a good job of giving you reason to improve your skill. On the graphical front it has been optimized for PCs so pixelated mess you may get from similar mobile game ports (looking at you Final Fantasy IV) isn't here.\n\nCON: The real annoyance comes from getting your controller to work. Whenever I tried running the game from my Steam library joy2key just wouldn't work to emulate the controls. The same also goes for if I tried starting it up in Big Picture mode. After much trial I found that if I launched the game from its .exe file rather than from STEAM's menu joy2key worked just fine. It's an annoyance that I hope they fix in the future. Another annoyance is needing a mouse in order to select menu options and start the game. I would've like to just use my controller for this stuff but, as it is right now that's just not possible.\n\nCONCLUSION: With all the cons taken into consideration I'd still reccomend this game, particularly if you use an Atari-style joystick like I did. It'll please both people who likes the arcade original and newcomers alike.","April 10","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
