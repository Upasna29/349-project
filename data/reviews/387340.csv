"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/recommended/387340/","pepsimanvsjoe","pepsimanvsjoe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/","1281 products in account","You're probably well-familiar with the Hyperdimension franchise by now. Alongside Compile Heart's most popular RPG series, Idea Factory has commissioned the assistance of various developers, in order to produce spin-offs. It seems like every year, two or more Neptunia games are being released. Are we heading towards complete global saturation? It's too soon to tell. For now, let's look at the first spin-off to hit Steam: Hyperdimension Neptunia U: Action Unleashed. In the interest of sanity, I'm shortening the title to NepU for the remainder of the review.\n\nNepU is by Tamsoft, the same developer responsible for the Onechanbara and Senran Kagura franchises. Those games are known for their fast-paced hack & slash action... among other things, but let's not get side-tracked just yet. Anyway, the plot of this game follows Famitsu and Dengikiko, two rival gaming-magazine writers looking for the next big story. Since Gamindustri revolves around the actions of the CPUs as well as the CPU Candidates, you can guess where this is going. Neptunia and company team up to complete quests and slash hundreds upon thousands of monsters.\n\nFans of Musou-styled games will feel right at home upon starting this one. Each quest consists of a small arena where monsters constantly spawn. By pressing the X and Y buttons, Nep & the gang perform a dizzying array of moves to decimate these hordes. There are also special attacks as well as HDD transformations for that touch of variety. For most quests, it's best to form a tag-team. Each of the 10 playable characters can team up, so if nothing else, you have Nepgear for backup in case Neptune takes a dirtnap. Your mission is usually some variation of "kill everything", but sometimes there can be hidden objectives or mid-boss battles. The heroines also level-up and earn monster-medals, which can boost stats and unlock equipment.\n\nSince this is a Neptunia game and it is by Tamsoft, a little somethin' somethin' is provided for the fans. You know what I'm talking about right? Fan-service. Unlike most videogames, clothes are not immune to damage. Depending on the severity of the attack, the ladies can get stripped to their skivvies. This affects HDD forms as well. The loss of clothes can result in more damage, for you as well as the enemy. Visually, getting stripped affects some characters more than others. For Vert's HDD form, her attire changes from "leaves little to the imagination" to "Who needs imagination?" In case all of this makes you uncomfortable, damage-immune clothing can be easily acquired.\n\nOverall I think that the combat is fun, but also not very deep. This can be attributed to the lack of difficulty. While the monsters can hit pretty hard, in most circumstances, they'll never get the chance to attack. The ladies of Gamindustri are usually too powerful to be threatened by these pitiful creatures. Their moves have a lot of range, and monsters are easily stunned. When the ladies are transformed, whatever semblance of a sliver of threat that the monsters had slips away. If a quest is giving you trouble, it's probably because you're attempting something that is too high a level. Unfortunately, the level of difficulty never really achieves the right balance. As with the Neptunia RPGs, the challenge of the post-game is in dealing with monsters that have mountains of HP, and are capable of killing level 99 heroines in a couple hits. It might be best to approach this portion of the game with a "don't get hit" mindset. There are a couple accessories that trade survivalability for increased damage output. Dodging projectiles and other attacks is pretty satisfying, but for the most part, you'll be too busy crushing everything to notice.\n\nAlongside the lack of challenge is the absence of conflict. Unlike the Console Industry, everyone in Gamindustri gets along like chocolate and pretzels. Didn't the first Neptunia RPG start off with the CPUs fighting to the death? I know they're all friends now, but shouldn't some attempts have been made to introduce a rivalry in NepU that goes beyond mild teasing? In the Onechanbara and Senran Kagura games, you might cut through a lot of mindless zombies and kunoichi, but you also have to contend with rivals. These opponents have abilities that are on par with your own. Aside from an optional and underutilized bonus mode, there aren't any instances where the CPUs and Candidates fight each other.\n\nThis to me is the perfect example of a missed opportunity. I've played and enjoyed the three Re;Birth RPGs, and while they're all pretty easy, their storylines feel "earned". The characters in these games might have wacky personalities and form-fitting attire, but they also run into problems, argue, and even fight each other. Eventually they rise up to the challenge and defeat the villains that have troubled them throughout their adventure. NepU doesn't have any real adversaries, and the big bad boss is only fought twice, in two very lop-sided battles. There isn't even a lame excuse for the heroines to fight each other. Even if it was something petty like Noire accusing Blanc for stealing her quests, it would make for a more interesting story. Naturally, this would translate into a more dynamic game, especially if you had to adopt a second style of fighting, in order to deal with rivals. Perhaps these opponents could have monsters under their control, and... well you get the idea.\n\nThe PC port is fantastic. Support for a plethora of resolutions and 60 fps? This game's got them. If you're looking for crashes or major bugs, you'll have to look elsewhere. The load-times are also far better than in the Vita version. I suppose that's to be expected, but it's welcome all the same. While not specifically related to the port, I really appreciate that all of the skits are voiced in English. This wasn't the case for the Re;Birth games, and I found myself defaulting to the Japanese voices, because the silence was irritating.\n\nIn conclusion, NepU succeeds if you're looking for something different from the Neptunia universe. There are some hilarious moments, and the process of gaining levels and slaughtering monsters is dumb fun. However, this game just isn't designed to remain compelling for a long period of time. Other hack & slash titles, including those by Tamsoft, offer far more depth and content. While this game is just a spin-off, I sincerely believe that more could have been done with it. Even die-hard followers of the Nep-Nep faith should take caution before plunging into this amusing but shallow diversion.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","March 21","true","18.9"," 326 of 361 people (90%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","90","326","361","15","9"

Fun Hack and slash action!!! Check.  Having the wife walk in on you while you're playing a game with half naked anime girls using suggestive language and bouncing around on your screen.....  Priceless..\n\nWhile I was playing Hyperdimension Action Neptune U, I was quite conflicted, on one hand I was nervous that someone would catch me playing the game.  I'm a full grown adult male but something about playing video games with half naked females prancing about still strikes the teenager in me.  All hot blooded American males have been there, that extra sense  Spidey Sense you get during alone time  ahem, your vision becomes 20/20, you could hear a pin drop on a feather mattress, and your eyes fluctuate between the television and the door.  Even though you're totally into what you're doing, like a tiger you prepare, ready to pounce on the remote control and change the station.  The weather channel firmly ready to go on, nobody suspects anything when someone is watching The weather channel..  Unfortunately looking back, I now know.. if you walk in on a surprised teenager, and notice the weather channel on the television, you should fully know something was rising but it wasn't the temperature.\n\nEnough about my teen years, it's time to talk about HANU, a spin off of the popular Hyper dimension series of video games.  The game is chocked full of humor, intrigue, sexual tension and enough half naked females to give Cinemax a run for it's money.  On top of the scantily clad females  (no I'm not talking about me Silly)  the game tells an interesting story, offers up fun combat, a story about rivalry, humiliation, and redemption.  Also it's a major bonus that the developers gave proper time to ensure the lady bits moved and flowed as realistically as possible.\n\nThe Story\nThe game takes place in a world known as Gamindustri  (Game Industry)  a world protected by divine  females known as CPU's or Console Patron Units... (Holy dang, a Central Processing unit, awesome) and their sisters the CPU candidates.  The game is situated after the previous games in a time of peace..  No major threats in sight boredom begins to reign supreme.  In an attempt to dispel the boredom two of the worlds leading journalist decide to write articles, Dengekiko decides to stick with the CPU's, she wants to write about them completing a series of quest and help bring the Goddesses extra fame and popularity.\n\nMuch like Dengekiko, the second Journalist Famitsu also wants to write an article about the CPU's but as an added twist she decides to focus on the CPU candidates, thinking that documenting the struggle of the candidates would make a far more interesting article.  Both groups head off to write their article.  Eventually after the rousing success of both ladies articles the news agency decides to have the two Journalist write another article, this time they join with the CPU and CPU candidates to take on a series of quest, the competition to see who can write the best article is on, and we as gamers are the winners because we get to play this amazing game.\n\nCombat\nThe combat is a silky smooth hack and slash experience with half naked anime girls.  Special attacks aplenty, and one really explosive attack known as HDD mode, which is essentially when they become super powered versions of themselves typically floating around doing amazing damage while at the same time taking little to no damage.. It's a complete visceral experience which will leave the gamer highly amused, intrigued and wanting more.   The combat is very similar in nature to Dynasty Warrior games, loads of enemies on screen at once, you button mash and watch as your overpowered female heroine slashes and crashes through them like a hot knife through butter..  (ok a few of them have ranged attacks as well, so I guess those are like hot pellets through butter)\n\nHealing is achieved by picking up bottles of potion dropped by enemies, a great strategy for the non exploration stages is leaving the potions alone, killing enemies and retreating to the potions location when you need it.  The enemies also drop coins exclusive to that version of enemy, you can use those coins to unlock special accessories, weapons, or upgrades for the ladies which can be very beneficial during combat.\n\nPro's\nSmooth and fluid combat\nGreat characters\nInteresting enemies\nHumorous non PC dialog\namazing voice acting..\nScores 10 on the fap o meter.\n\nCon's\nCan be kind of difficult to understand what's going on at times.\nIf you're a PC bro, you'll hate this game as it appears very sexist\nNo Bananas...   just kidding\n\nRecommendation\nHighly recommended game, and pretty amazing, a great addition to the Hyper-dimension series of games.  If you're a fan of half naked ladies (who isn't), err well the half naked ladies part sounds sexist...  If you're a fan of hack and slash combat, humorous stories, and totally outrageous non political correct fun, you should totally grab this game immediately.... GO NOW, why are you still reading, get out of the reviews!!!!  Go click the button that says BUY...  and pay for the game..","April 10","true","6.9"," 97 of 102 people (95%) found this review helpful 88 people found this review funny","95","97","102","88","1"

Your mileage may vary, I play all the other nep games on a keyboard.\n\nNEUTRAL: Quirks that might sway some Lack of Depth in mechanics\nNeptunia has never been the series for super in-depth complicated mechanics. It really shows. This sounds like a HUGE minus... However, It's not that bad and simple games have their place in this world. It's all about managing your expectations. It's more of a relaxing buttonmasher instead of a precise, execution heavy action RPG.\n8 Directional Controls even with a controller\n(There's auto aim/locking for normal attacks, so it's not as bad as it sounds)\nNo target locking. The WASD/Control Stick is the only way to choose your target to swing at\nYou must win a couple quests before you unlock unbreakable outfits\nOutside of "Hard" outfits there's no way to disable costume break.\nThe steam backgrounds/emotes aren't that fantastic this time around\nYour mileage will vary. This game features a Common Noire background, which is the first in the entire series. Also it's the only place to craft your Dengekiko and Famitsu background.\nThere are built in cheats in this game\nNo real New Game Plus\nVery limited invulnerability frames^\nDecent speedgame, if you're into speedrunning\nQuite a bit of the game is skipped by clipping through barriers, might not appeal to all\nGeneral lack of hard challenges\nThere are about 3 quests I'd consider calling them "hard", and two of them are DLC. I define hard as having to play thoughtfully, methodologically and exercise some degree of caution. Obviously your mileage will vary. The quests: Famitsu Solo Postgame, Lv99 Neptune/Dengekiko DLC Mission, Lv99 Uni/Blanc DLC Mission^Tip: The most relaible way to get iFrames when you're hit in decreasing order: Switch Partner, Transform, SP/EXE Skill, Dash\nAlmost none of these work if you're knocked airborne, so watch out for that. (All the CPUs can dash once midair in HDD though)\n\nBAD: These problems are likely to trigger people Port issues on AMD\nI don't have any experience on this since all nep ports have run perfectly on my machine, but some AMD users are clearly experiencing problems with this port. Consult a better source for more details. If you're having FPS issues, ensure it's not runing on your integrated graphics card.\nWeak Character Balance\nThere aren't many examples of beat-em-ups with good character balance, and this is definitely not one of them.\nIt's less broken than it seems (everyone's HDD is very strong), but there is still a clear distinction between weak/situational characters and very well rounded ones.\nMissable Achievements\nThis one got me pretty hard. I just spent the 8 hours before this review getting 100% quest completion on a new file because I missed a few on my first playthrough and was locked out of 100%. Since there's no New Game Plus, this is a double whammy.\nStat inbalance: Clear Dump Stat\nIt's very obvious which stat is the best once you hit midgame, after you play the game for a bit you'll know which stat to aim for in your equipment selection and which stats are largely irrelevant once you adjust your playstyle for it. Going full glass cannon is the go-to way to play this game, since dead enemies can't kill/interrupt you. See also the next section\nSnowballing Mechanics: Interruption\nThis is related to dump stats, but basically both enemies and you can interrupt each other indefinitely. This means that getting hit leads to next to instant death (partially thanks to lack of iFrames). However, the same applies to bosses too, if you can get the interruption on them, you'll wail on them forever and they won't have a chance to counterattack. And here's the thing: The interruption on bosses is dependent on the damage you do. If you don't hit for enough, you won't interrupt and the game becomes way harder because you cannot stop the strong or annoying attacks bosses have. This is why damage stacking is beyond OP.","March 27","true","71.9"," 62 of 69 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","62","69","3","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rankmenotplz/recommended/387340/","rankmenotplz","ReadingLies","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rankmenotplz/","2045 products in account","Originally exclusive to the PlayStation Vita, this action role-playing spin-off from the popular Hyperdimension Neptunia series brings in a fresh new take for the franchise enthusiasts and soon-to-be fans!\nGame Overview\nHyperdimension Neptunia U: Action Unleashed is set in the world of "Gamindustri" which is divided into four regions namely Planeptune, Lastation, Lowee, and Leanbox (in which three of them are intended puns for the popular modern consoles). Each of these regions have their own deities (to which they refer as CPUs) that oversee them, along with their candidates.\n\nThese CPUs and CPU Candidates, along with two Gamindustri Journalists, are the playable characters that you can choose to play as in each quest you engage (though there are some quests that restricts which characters you can use).\n\nWhile this take differs heavily from the early ones in the series in terms of game play (as it focuses more on a straight-up action/hack n' slash theme), it carries on the charming, comedic, and quirky story of our heroines.\n\n\nThe Pros\nExcellent Art Design - This factor has always been present in games published/developed by Idea Factory, and that standard is still upheld in producing this one which is impressive to say at the very least. Also, the game has plenty of "fan-service" that is dedicated for their fans with the addition of the "Costume Break" feature.\n\nFluid Controls - The game plays absolutely smooth especially when you're using a gamepad. There's also a mapping tool to change the button assignment that fits to your play style.\n\nGreat Audio - From the great game soundtracks up to the impressive voice overs (which is both available in English and Japanese versions), the audio that is featured fits the theme of the game perfectly. You can even chill out and listen to the tracks that is available on the world menu.\n\nPlenty of Contents to Unlock - There are tons of equipment, quests, and even a new game mode that you can unlock as you progress through, which contributes to the longevity of the game.\n\nThe Cons\nShort and Repetitive - Unlike the RPG versions of Hyperdimension Neptunia which showcases an average of at least a hundred hours of gameplay for the scope of the whole game, this hack n' slash spin-off could yield a total gameplay time of less than 70 hours to complete and is mostly a one-mode game which is repeated in a succession of quests.\n\nInadequate Difficulty Levels - Honestly, if you look and consider that this game is pointed at casual gamers, the difficulty of the game is perfectly balanced. However, considering the gaming community as a whole, the difficulty level is relatively easy to the extent that I rarely fail an attempt on a quest, even when using characters that are below recommended level.\n\nThe Verdict\nTo make it short, Get it!\n\nFor those who are new to the franchise and is interested in trying the game but is concerned if they should get the other games first, do not worry as this game isn't heavy in terms of story and it is worth the buy.\n\nAnd for the long time fans of the series, getting this is a must.\n\nIf you like to see more recommended games that is worth the value you are paying, please visit my other reviews, or follow our curator group at Good Games Giveaways & Reviews.","April 10","true","31.4"," 58 of 63 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","58","63","3","4"

It was originally released for the PS Vita.\n\nThe story is that Gamindustri is in a very peaceful state, so two journalists called Dengekiko and Famitsu (Based off real magazines in Japan) ask the CPUs and CPU candidates to do some quests that they planned to get a good story going. Afterwards, the gang just completes more and more quests for the journalists, but there's been a rapid increase in quests, and everything is not what it seems.\n\nThe story obviously isn't as rich or deep as the main series, but it still has a plentiful amount of cutscenes and the writing is still solid. However, it isn't a huge chunk of the game like the mainstream titles. Fans of the series will be pleased with it, even if it is a little shallow. Due to the game's simple plot and gameplay, you won't find anything too interesting to write home about. At least the character interactions are still as good as ever.\n\nPlus, the English dub is 100% voiced acted; there are no missing voices in any cutscenes, unlike the Re;birth series. (If that's your preference.)\n\n\n\nYou can choose from 10 characters: The CPUs, the Candidates, Dengekiko and Famitsu. Each of them play a bit differently, and all have their own stats. For example, Uni has a rifle so she's most effective at mid-range and building her special ability, while Neptune does quick but weak melee attacks. It's mostly melee oriented, excluding Uni, Rom, and Ram. The character's melee attacks are different though; some of them hit hard but can't string combos very well, and some can do the opposite. Everyone has the same run speed. There's also equipment that the characters can equip, adding or taking away certain stats like defense and SP. You earn these by killing a certain number of a certain enemy.\n\nRelated to all that stuff, there's a feature called "Costume Break" (Yes, this is where the fanservice comes in). If you take enough damage, your character's clothes will almost completely rip apart. What that does is that you're prone to taking more damage. However, you do more damage, so it's actually a risk vs. reward kinda thing. If you like or hate Costume Break, you can get variations of clothes that will affect this by leveling your characters up. There's unbreakable clothes that never trigger the break, easy to rip clothes that'll trigger break very easily, and pre-torn clothes to where you're immediately in Costume Break.\n\n\n\nGameplay is pretty different as you might of guessed. It's something like Dynasty Warriors if you wanna make a comparison. You can bring along 2 characters or go solo, and they fight one at a time. You're able to switch your character at any time unless they're KO'd, and the character in the back will regenerate HP. You have light attacks, heavy attacks, and special moves, and of course you can string together light and heavy attacks. Everybody has special attacks, and they take up either 1, 2, or 3 SP bars. You build up SP by simply attacking enemies. So because it's a Neptunia game, everyone can transform into their HDD counterparts, which upgrades all your stats and gives you superior attacks. (You'll also get all your clothes back if you were previously in Costume Break) You have an "EXE Drive" meter which builds as you attack enemies; this is how you go HDD. The character currently not being used will build EXE much faster than the one fighting. This is really all I can say about the gameplay, it is rather shallow sadly. Luckily, it's a lot of fun to slash down dozens of enemies at once, and if you're a fan of hack n' slash or want some dumb but frantic action, this is definitely for you.\n\nThe quests are where you'll choose which missions to do. They all carry a "recommended level" that your character should be, and some of them require 2 specific characters to use. The actual objectives are usually very simple. You either kill the boss enemy, kill a certain number of enemies, find a specific item, or locate an exit. There really isn't much variety to the missions, and they're all fairly simple. There are certain quests that don't have an objective, called an Irregular Quest. You simply hop into the mission and figure out what to do. (The description provides a hint)\n\n\n\nAfter you beat the story, you unlock various things, including cheats, extra quests to complete, what's called "The Gamindustri Gauntlet" where it's a tournament style type of game mode where all the characters face off against one another in a 1v1 battle. You can pick whoever you want to play as and put the characters in whateve order you like. (You can even have HDD counterparts as separate characters.) If you win, you will win some new cheats and accessories that the characters can wear.\n\n\nSo anyway, Neptunia U is a pretty fun Hack N' Slash that just provides stupid fun in killing tons of enemies with a story that'll satisfy Neptunia fans enough. I recommend picking it up on a sale.\n\n7/10","March 22","true","21.1"," 37 of 48 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","37","48","3","1"

If you are not a fan of this franchise and want to give it a try, then you should start with  Neptunia Re;Birth 1\n\nIntroducing\nHyperdimension Neptunia U: Action Unleashed is the 3rd spinoff of the Neptunia franchise by Idea Factory, and the 4th game to be ported to PC. Unlike the Re;Birth games, this game is action-based (hence the title), so expect some confusions at first. I recommend you change the voice to Japanese to enjoy this game to the fullest.\n\nGOOD elements of this game:\n- Fresh and humourous atmosphere. Fortunately, this game retains a fresh and humourous appearance, which made the mainline Neptunia games. You will encounter many references, jokes, and 4th wall breaking moments in various characters, conversations, and even in-battle dialogues.\n- Smooth, fast-paced hack n' slash gameplay. This is a Musou-type action game, so expect a gameplay similar to Sengan Kagura or Dynasty Warrior. Also this is a very good way to release stress.\n- Pretty good music and sountracks. Personally I really liked the opening theme of the game (Venus no Harmonia - Asami Imai). The soundtracks include many tracks from the previous Neptunia games, and are pretty appropriate for an action game like this one.\n- Excellent optimization. Recently, there are many bad PC ports by Japanese companies (Such as Naruto Storm 4, Tales of Symphonia, and Disgaea). However, IFI did a very appreciable work of optimizing this game, making it runs fluently even on a 5-year-old PC. Basically, if your PC can play Rebirth 1, then it can max this out at ease.\n- Some best-looking badges that I've ever seen.\n\nAVERAGE or DEBATABLE elements of this game:\n- Many fanservice elements . Personally, I have no problem with fanservice, especially when it appears in a spinoff. Anyway, you can turn it off completely after a few battles, if you don't want it.\n- Pretty limited customization. For each character, there are about 3 weapons, 3 skills, a few costumes and a fixed combo set; which is nowhere as near as mainline Neptunia games.\n- No mouse support, and you cannot change music in battle\n\nBAD elements of this game:\n- The plot is half-baked. I'm not gonna spoil anything here. This is generally a problem for spinoffs, but I'm sure they can do it better.\n- Quests can be repetitive and grindy after a long time of playing. For this problem, I advise that you should do a quest several times with different characters, and shouldn't play it too much in a day.\n- Textures and sprites are extremely low-res. You'll notice this immediately if you've played Re;Birth 3, or if you trigger a Costume Break with Vert.\n\nConclusion:\nDespite having a weak plot and a flawed quest system,  Hyperdimension Neptunia U: Action Unleashed still contains many humour layers, plus a smooth and flexible combat system that any Neptunia fans out there will enjoy. Also, a thumb-up for Idea Factory International for making such a good port.\nI give this game a 6.5 overall, and a 7.5 in its Anime category.\nFor Neptunia fans out there, I recommend getting this game on a sale (probably bigger than 50%). For anyone else interested in this franchise, I recommend that you should start with Re;Birth 1. If you've read up to this point, I'm sure you will like it.","April 2","true","9.5"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","19","20","3","3"

Hopefully in future games, they'll make more appearances.\n\nI think if Action Unleashed was more similar to Phantasy Star Universe then the game could have been amazing, but unfortunately it isn't.

Mainly because it looked like a different Neptunia experience compared to the standard fare of the Re;Birth games & the originals on PS3. So, I was happy to try out a different approach to the series.\n\nHow'd it turn out? Well, read on to find out, I guess.\n\nStory:As always - I won't be spoiling anything in this and I'll just give my thoughts immediately.\nAction Unleashed's story was...mixed for me. There isn't a whole lot going on this time around, so there's not as much to discuss as if I'd be reviewing the main series games, but overall - this story is rather hit or miss. It didn't really get me pumped up for really anything and the ending of the story didn't really feel like a proper "ending" either. On the other hand though, it was nice getting some non-canonical character development from all of the main characters, as well as a bit of spotlight on some rather obscure characters, namely Dengekiko & Famitsu. It was nice seeing them go from an icon in the world map in the main series games to their own fleshed out characters in this game.\nThe reason I say this story is a hit or miss is because it's repetitive and doesn't do a whole lot of interesting things. Some moments did catch me off-guard (looking at you, Blanny Blanny Bii!) but the rest of the story was predictable as hell and didn't really interest me.\nHowever, the standard Neptunia comedy is back in full force here and it genuinely made me laugh at some parts of the game, also making for some good profile screenshots.\nHonestly though, your enjoyment of the story depends on your tastes. If you don't mind a predictable story with great comedy, you'll like it, but if you're looking for a serious story - this is definitely not for you and the story will probably bore you to death.\n\nGameplay:If you're tired of the same JRPG format being copied & pasted between the main series games with some minor alterations in-between, fear not, because this game has pretty much NOTHING to do with anything RPG related, apart from equipping stuff & using SP skills.\nAs the title implies, this game focuses more on "Action" than "Strategy", as this game is a pure hack & slash.\nHow'd my enjoyment go for basically my first entry into a hack & slash game? Well, given how I haven't played a hack & slash game before, this one was fun, but it got old fast. Multiple times while playing I got bored. While yes, it can be insanely satisfying to pull off a massive killing spree with a single combo, 95% of the game I ended up just abusing that single combo and I wasn't punished for it, kinda making for a very bland experience. It's obvious that some characters in this game are way better than others and I'm sad I didn't end up using Blanc, Dengekiko or Famitsu a lot throughout my playthrough, but they ended up being the most useless characters of the whole bunch for me with their relatively slow attack speed & slow recovery, making them far too vulnerable. In fact, my most used characters were Vert, Uni & Ram, given how their DPS can reach the absolute absurds & their attack speeds are rather fast.\nTo those of you who don't know, however, you progress the story in this game by clearing quests. How that's executed in this game doesn't really please me. I swear to god, around 90% of the quests are either "Kill x amount of enemies" or "Kill enemy named y" and that gets very repetitive. The other 10% are basically fetch quests or escape quests, but they are not very common in this game, as well as "Irregular Quests", which are basically reskins of the previously mentioned quest types.\nTo summarize, I'll say that the gameplay is a great time waster for short bursts, but in my opinion - anything more than 2 or 3 hours per session will bore you to death very fast.\n\nPresentation:NOTE: This section covers graphics, optimisation & sound.\nThe graphics aren't a step up nor are they a step down from the main series games at all. Models are on par, textures are pretty much the same with little variation & the monsters are basically ripped straight out of the main series games, so Neptunia fans will feel right at home here.\nOptimisation wise however, good god, this is the best port Idea Factory has ever put out on Steam, period. I was amazed at the fact that I could run this game on my awful Pentium Dual-Core laptop with around 20-25 FPS for most of the game. Granted, the game played as if I applied slow-mo to it, but it was very playable and I ended up beating the entire game like that. There are a few odd quirks, such as the results screen being oddly blurry, but there is a community patch to fix that, so I don't have anything to complain about. Basically, very well optimised game and that was very impressive, great job IFI!\nSound wise, I think this is a step up from the main series games as well. In terms of voice acting, all the voice actors are the same, so I have nothing to complain about here either. The music is where it's the step up. I always complain that the Neptunia series never seems to have good music, apart from the opening & ending themes, but this game has songs that I genuinely enjoy, honestly. Granted, the amount of songs they added are small, but they are a joy to listen to. I especially love the cutscene music that plays - named "I'm Feeling Lucky" - because the beat is rather catchy & the song itself is funky. So, music-wise - definitely the biggest step forwards this game has taken from the main series games!\n\nFinal Verdict:Overall, despite how much flack I gave this game in this review, I had a blast playing it overall. The comedy being on par with the main series, as well as seeing the characters in a bit of a casual light was very refreshing and while the game was overall painfully repetitive, I found it fantastic in short bursts. Overall, I would recommend this game as a comedy-filled time killer. But if you're looking for something generally serious, I urge you to steer clear from this one. This spin-off is targeted mainly towards Neptunia fans who want something different.","May 14","true","28.2"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","13","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Psygineer/recommended/387340/","Psygineer","Psygineer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Psygineer/","1509 products in account","Introduction\nDiverging from the Japanese style Role-Playing Game nature of the previous Re;Birth entries in the Hyperdimension Neptunia series currently available on Steam, Hyperdimention Neptunia U: Action Unleashed is a Hack and Slash Action game. You will fight unyielding hordes of enemies simultaneously until the conditions of your current mission are satisfied. Set in a video game consoles inspired world, you will find many enjoyable references to other video games scattered throughout as you play.\n\nGameplay\nThe game revolves around controlling one character at time on missions that take place in an arena like field. In most cases an optional second character can be waiting in the wings to take over for the current character if need be. Each mission has a success condition that must be met before the event is allowed to end. Typically, a mission involves killing unending throngs of monsters and often includes a few bosses sprinkled in for good measure. Since you are just one character, you have a number of abilities to help you achieve success. There is the normal attack, which is very effective in its own right, the heavy attack that is generally much more effective than the normal attack but has a drawback. Heavy attack helps to damage your costume each time you use it. Using these two types of attacks together allows you to make powerful combos. There are also special abilities that each character possesses that can really help turn the tide of battle in their favour. Once you have either been damaged enough or have done enough damage, a super powered option (HDD) becomes available. The HDD powered option is something like a new character entering the field.  It shares most of the same abilities as the character that summoned it but all of which are far more powerful than the normal version of them.\n\nA battle damaged costume on a character reduces their defense but increases the rate in which their super power charges up. It‚Äôs a trade off but since the super power versions is significantly more powerful, it is generally worth it to let the costume become ruined through the over use of powerful attacks. If you prefer to make the game more challenging there is an unlockable outfit that can‚Äôt be damaged thus reducing the rate in which the super power charges. There is also the ability to start the round with the costume already damaged thus making your life more difficult early on as you wait for the super power to charge.\n\nThe majority of the game is spent on missions either doing them for the first time or repeating them to farm medals from the monsters found in that particular mission. Medals are used to unlock new weapons, power ups, and equipment in order to aid you to complete the more difficult missions. You will find yourself grinding away for them to some degree. Some monsters are common enough that you will hit the 999 cap without needing to farm them, others show up less often so you may have to actively hunt them down in old missions. Luckily missions can be completed rather quickly so it isn‚Äôt that painful to grind a mission repeatedly. This is especially true if you are supremely overpowered for that particular mission.\n\nThe charming mystery story of Hyperdimension Neptunia U revolves around two Gameindustri Journalists trying to outdo each other by getting the better scoop. They follow the CPUs (Console Patron Units) and CPU Candidates around out in the field trying to get material and images for their respective magazine articles and news reports. If you are a fan of visual novels or other games that put more emphasis on story and less on actual gameplay, Hyperdimension Neptunia U should be right up your alley. The game often finds itself broken off into long conversions taking place among a selection of the ten characters in-between missions. For the most part, the missions themselves really have no impact on the story and are just used as a device to transition between dialogues. There is nothing really wrong with this though as the fully voiced dialogues between the characters are almost always very humourous and fun to listen to. The way the characters interact with each other and have their own playful rivalries and friendships going on makes the game feel alive. There is no real method to impact on the conversations though so if you were to replay the game, you would hear the same dialogues each time. There are no prompts to select a topic or idea for them to discuss. You are really playing more of a passive role during these times.\n\nOverall Hyperdimension Neptunia U: Action Unleashed is a game that should satisfy Hyperdimension Neptunia fans as they get to interact with their favourite CPUs again and hear more of their story. Albeit, it is a story set in an alternate dimension and not considered cannon to the rest of the Hyperdimension Neptuna story. For people who like Visual Novels or Arena style Action battle games, Hyperdimension Neptunia U is a great place to get into the Hyperdimension Neptunia universe. There is a lot of story to enjoy without a lot of gameplay/questing getting in the way of it although there is no real way to drive the story yourself. If you are classic JRPG fan you may not like Hyperdimension Neptunia U as much as you would the Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth series, which is an excellent series in its own right and you owe it to yourself to check it out.\n\nPros:The Hyperdimention Neptunia characters are back in an all new game\nWhile not as long as the Re;Birth series, U is a very lengthy game\nThe characters feel alive, as if you are actually listening into potential real life conversations among friends\nGreat Visual effects and accompanying Audio. The characters are all well detailed including some interesting ‚Äúfan service‚Äù thrown in there as well if you are into that sort of thing\nFully voice acted\nThe controls work great for this game. Very fluid and easy to control. Making a combo doesn‚Äôt involve memorizing tons of nerve racking key presses in advance\nThe idea that costumes can be damaged by the enemies attacks and through wear and tear makes for a more realistic element in the game\nUnlockable content that helps make the game more enjoyable and stretches out gameplay\nPaid DLC are reasonably priced for what they give\n\nCons:Missions are very repetitive and not overly challenging once you get the hang of them. They feel like they were just thrown in as an afterthought to help break up the story a bit\nThere is no story during a mission and the characters frequently repeat the same phrases to each other\nCombat is repetitive\nSince you have little impact to the story yourself, there is no real draw to replay it right away. Since it is a long game, I am perfectly fine with that, but it could be a negative to others who enjoy seeing multiple stories unfold in one game\nAchievements are a real grind fest\nRecommendation\nDespite the fact combat and missions are repetitive, the mysterious and charming story behind Hyperdimention Neptunia U: Action Unleashed is enough to keep you wanting more. If you are a fan of the Hyperdimention Neptunia series, go for it, you likely won‚Äôt regret it. If you are new to the series and a JRPG fan, I‚Äôd say start with the Re;Birth series and then get U to enjoy more story related to your new found friends. If you are a fan of Bullet Hell style games where you are massively outnumbered and are fighting to survive, you likely would love U if you equip the forced Level 1 only accessory. Go ahead, give it a go!","April 10","true","42.3"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kaorin/recommended/387340/","Kaorin","Ryouna","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kaorin/","140 products in account","I'd like to start off by saying I love Neptunia, despite the atrocious localization and the monstrous re-use of assets I still enjoy the main series games. However, I cannot recommend this game as a Neptunia fan, an action game fan, a musou game fan, and even a grinding fan. The fact that this game has a 95% positive score on Steam is almost insulting, and here's why.\n\nJust have three raw uncut gameplay videos showing off six of ten playable characters in three random missions;\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cwBAzvirSY\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgMwTVZPe2I\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC6kmOt8Lj8\n\nAfter seeing even 10 seconds of ANY of these videos you will have seen literally the entire gameplay breadth. EVERY mission is like this and every character plays like this from the start to the end. (Blanc and Famitsu just spam an SP skill, Vert and Dengekiko spam B+Y)\n\nAnother disappointing aspect is the costume break system, where you would assume there would be a large selection of costumes to highlight this. Unfortunately you're only met with major disappointment when you realize you only have access to everyone's default costume, two recolors of the default costume, and the swimsuit. (you only get the base costume and one recolor in HDD Megami form!) Not even the maid outfits for the Candidates from Re:Birth 1 make an appearance.\n\nTo top the disappointment cake off, after spending way too much time Spamming X, sometimes Y through the main "story" you are rewarded with a 50-floor tower that's just the same thing that you have to clear with every character. This game is a hell of a grind for the 100% achievement, stretching about 2 hours of actual gameplay time to around 20+ and that is no joke. (that's 20+ hours of getting in a corner and pressing X or Y until the mission is over!)\n\nIf you're looking for a musou game on PC that actually has some gameplay in it, get Dynasty Warriors 8: Xtreme Legends. It goes on sale often enough and that game gave me around 100 hours of gameplay for only slightly more than I spent on this. Playing this made me want to go back and play that instead!","March 29","false","25.3"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vallinek/recommended/387340/","vallinek","Vallinek","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vallinek/","82 products in account","Hyperdimension Neptunia U: Action Unleashed is a spinoff musou-style beat 'em up to the Neptunia franchise, which came out originally on PS Vita in 2015, ported to PC and released on Steam almost a year later. In here, you take control of one of the familiar Neptunia characters and fight against huge hordes of monsters and occassionally bosses.\n\nGraphic-wise, the game isn't much different from other Neptunia games already ported to Steam. The textures are a little blurry here and there, but it's nothing too bad. The animations for characters were also redone, and it's fun to watch their different combos.\n\nIn terms of music, it reuses a lot of tracks from the previous games, even including some of the favorites, like old battle themes and nation themes from each game. On top of that, it adds a few of its own amazing battle tracks, most of which playing during different HDD transformations - and all of them are awesome, whether you're talking about Perfect Purple, Black Brave, White Wings, Greedy Green or Eager Editor. They simply have that kick and "oomph" to them that makes them so satisfying to hear.\n\nGameplay-wise, it's pretty much what you would expect: you deploy on missions with a tag-team of two characters, defeating monsters, with a clear goal, which is usually "beat X monsters" or "defeat the boss", with some variations ever now and then. The difference is that you will take on tens or even hundreds of monsters at once, using characters' various abilities, from standard attacks, SP skills, to EXE Drives. You can also activate HDD to gain heightened stats and attack power, as well as a new, upgraded set of combos. You can also freely swap between team members at any given time, with the one in the back row slowly regenerating her health.\nAnother unique or... kind of unique feature is the Costume Break, where if your character takes enough damage, her clothes get ripped up for... fanservice's sake. It also affects your stats, lowering defense but increasing critical hit chance and giving you 50% extra EXE Drive gauge instantly. The presence of this mechanic is honestly not surprising, considering it is Neptunia, and it was also made by Tamsoft, known for their work on even more explicit but similar in nature Senran Kagura series.\n\nStory-wise, it's not nearly as good as the main series' RPG games. It follows our Goddesses as they are being interviewed by two new playable characters, Dengekiko and Famitsu (rather obviously based on Japanese gaming mags) as they take on a slew of new monster-slaying Quests, with a new emerging threat... which is so shallow that even the characters comment on it being so. While the extra scenes and the fourth-wall-breaking humor is like always top-notch, the story mode only takes about fifteen-twenty hours to complete, and that's not speedrunning it. Also the game is surprisingly easy, mostly due to how the stats scale and how the monsters aren't very mobile, even bosses just following the general "get close and launch an attack" schtick... well, at least outside of Gamindustri Gauntlet set to the highest difficulty level, and the Hard Mode DLC missions... and who can forget the final boss of the Neptral Tower being a stupidly-huge damage sponge, extending the fight to insane lengths? Thank God for cheats, even if they suck the challenge out of the game, at least they make it a little less tedious.\n\nSpeaking of said Neptral Tower, being supposedly the final post-game content, it has rather idiosyncratic floor levels, frequently taking between ten seconds and five minutes in completion time, on top of level scaling that is just all over the place. You can have one floor have a reccommended level of 25, then the next having 5, and the one after that 44. On top of all that, to fully clear it, you will have to get all ten playable characters through this, and since you can only have two characters at a time, it'll take you a total of five times to do.\n\nThe last nitpicks from me is the fact that the roster of characters isn't balanced very well (shooter characters like Uni are hilariously easy to beat the game with if you know what you're doing), and sometimes even going HDD isn't the best option (Vert loses a lot of mobility and speed when she becomes Green Heart).\nAlso the series suddenly switched from using DirectInput controllers for Re;Birth games to using XInput ones. It's a little annoying on my side but nothing I can't work around easily.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the game until at least the general repetitiveness of the post-game content kicked in, but it is admittedly a short experience that definitely will not be appreciated by anyone who isn't already a Nep fan. If you really enjoy the Hyperdimension Neptunia games on Steam, go ahead and try it out, but otherwise it definitely isn't the best start with the series.","April 13","true","37.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Instead of a visual novel JRPG we are being served a non-canon hack n' slash game with characters from the mentioned series.\n\nAbout the game itself:As a huge fan of the franchise, i've had a really good time playing the game with my beloved characters. I'm surprised how well it fit into my tastes. However, this game is not perfect. As long as i really enjoyed the time spent with it, the game is repetitive and does not really offer anything challenging throughout it. It's a casual game.\n\nEnemies do not differ too much from each other. There are different types of them with different attacks, but you won't notice it because they will swarm you and you will keep smashing buttons anyway, so it does not matter in the long run.\n\nDifferent characters have different attack patterns and different combos in different forms, which is really nice, it makes the game more fun to play if you really want to get the most of it. Game allows you to choose gear for your characters with medals which you drop from enemies. You can exchange them for gear or stat bonuses. There are different ways to build your equipment and some of them are interesting, such as a 9000 attack but 1 defense build. Oh, and there is fanservice in this game. However, you can make it appear more often, choose already ripped off clothes or turn it off at all. It's up to your tastes. I guess.\n\nHowever, grinding for achievements in this game might be the worst of them all so far. It's boring. You have to clear a 50 floor tower 5 times with different characters and clear some kind of battleground with every character in the game (which is not that bad, actually). The rest of the achievements is based story-wise, so you get them while playing.\n\nIn short, the game is good, but you might not like it if you are not familiar with the franchise. My first playthrough took me around 17 to 18 hours and there is a lot to do after the story mode. The game is simply fun, but i would not recommend buying it at full price. I'm not saying it's not worth it, but 28 euro is a little too much for a spin-off title which offers half of the gameplay time of the previous games.\n\nTL;DR\nPros:+More nep\n+Brings characters to life even more than before\n+Different combos for every character\n+There is what to do after finishing the story mode\n\nMedium:+Fanservice\n-Fanservice\n\nCons:-Repetitive gameplay\n-Achievement grinding is really grindy","April 3","true","29.5"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","9","11","2","0"

If you're fan of hack n slash genre but don't know Neptunia, there are most likely better options out there. That's not to say that this one is bad though. If you don't know Hyperdimension Neptunia this is bad game to start the series - the story somewhat assumes you know the characters already. It's much better to play Re;birth 1 instead.\n\nThe later part is aimed mostly to HDN fans.\n\nOn positives - In this game the good neptunia humor is still out there. The hack n slash mechanics are relaxing, albeit not too demanding, and the characters are distinct enough with their playstyles. I really enjoyed new additions to the roster - Dengekiko and Famitsu. Both are really cute and entertaining. I also love attention to small details in this game - like secondary characters comments during combat, lily rank dialogues, or even small coments the characters make when they are chosen or withdrawn for quests. I'm not really fan of fanservicey stuff, but I love the embarassed faces some characters make then, like Famitsu. It's adorable in it's own way.\n\nOn negatives - while jokes are there, there aren't too much of them, because story is really sparse. Re;birth counterparts are much more rich in plot (THAT plot as well). In addition Fanservicey stuff went a little too far with Rom and Ram. It's not that much of the problem though, as there are unbreakable clothes to equip. Still cringed for a moment. I'm not CFW Trick :( The balance is also not really there - some characters have much stronger combos and control than other ones. But all characters work well, so it's similar to RB games where basically any party worked. Game also lags at times, especially in snow stage for me or at beginning of the quest. Which is weird given my rather high-end PC. There is also an issue of sound - "Boss of DOS" track plays to often, and monster sounds gets annoying after short while. Hopefully they can be turned off while keeping godess' (and journalists) voices. And last but not least.... LILY RANKS. Thanks satan for reminding me times of korean grinder MMOs where leveling pace of 0,7% per hour was normal.\n\nTo sum up...\n\nPositives:\n+Good old Neptunia wit\n+Dengekiko and Famitsu\n+Fun hack n slash mechanics\n+Diverse cast\n+Funny enjoyable small dialogues thrown here and there (lily ranks, secondary character comments, character select comments)\n\n+/- Quite heavy on fanservice (but it can be "turned off" by wearing ubreakable clothes so it's not the big issue for those who don't like it)\n\nNegatives:\n-Lackluster, sparse story\n-Rom and Ram cloth breaking.... come on IF we're not CFW Trick in disguise :<\n-Characters aren't really balanced\n-Some technical issues - rare lagging\n-Annoying monsters' sound effects and repetitive "Boss of DOS" track\n-Lily rank grind\n\nTo me as HDN fan it's solid 7,5/10 game. It's not as good as RB counterparts, but the fun is still there, and if you like Hyperdimension Neptunia games, you'll most likely like this one as well. If you don't know HDN, you should definitely check out Re;birth 1!\n\n\nTL;DR\n\nDecent Neptunia entry, not as good as Re;birth counterparts but enjoyable enough.\n\n7,5/10","March 22","true","56.3"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

Hyperdimension Neptunia U: Action Unleashed is spin-off with new: story, characters and battle system.

For example we want to change volume level or just start new game. There is nothing special but still nice to hear something more than ‚Äúpip‚Äù when we choose option.\n\nLike i said before Hyperdimension Neptunia U have different battle system but still in well-known to us dungeons.

In case of this product is just hack and slash with hundred enemies.\n\nCompared to previous titles we finally got full English dubbing without any shortages. I mean every dialogoue have dubbing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anitude/recommended/387340/","Anitude","Annie T. Mood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anitude/","940 products in account","A supposedly non-canonical spin-off of the Nep-nep series that takes the more action-y route as opposed to its usual turn-based dungeon-crawlilng RPG style. The Neptunia series isn't exactly well known for its "exciting" gameplay and this one's no different. The idea of going from RPG to beat-em-up/hack-and-slash thing was there but the way it's done I don't believe makes it anymore exciting especially when repetition is a trait this series comes with.\n\nThe default keybindings are abysmal, but rebindable. It doesn't help that the tutorial is meant for controllers and  that all the mouse can do when it's used at all is move the camera around but only while holding the LMB. The game was meant for a controller and not much work was put into the thought of keyboard (& mouse) play.\n\nOne piece of trouble with the actual game is that you're practically going through the same dungeon each and every time with a goalset barely different from the last. "Clear condition" for a "quest" may be to kill 300some enemies or find the exit but it all just comes down to "go here and kill what you see" with barely any form of thought into actually doing so, and that's the entire game up to the final boss and its "end-game" content.\nThere are a teeny few bit of combos from the melee characters (which having a minute number itself isn't helpful for this kind of game) but the three ranged ones have far less and when they transform it doesn't take much effort to obliterate everything and win harmless since you can keep floating around and shooting while keeping the loads of enemies stunned. The transformations are supposed to be temporary but all the ranged characters can go by transformed for the duration of an entire run because of how much of a mob they can keep hitting.\nWith the look of how practically all of the recycled enemies have always been throughout the series most of 'em don't exactly give off that threatening look so I didn't get a whole lot of fun out of wailing on loads of plush toy look-a-likes. They eventually hit pretty hard but the repetition still kicks in when doing the same task over and over again.\nYou're free to choose which dungeon you go to. Entering and completing "NEW" dungeons eventually progresses the story, which itself I found was very underwhelming & short, at least in comparison to its RPG counterparts.\n\nHitting the level cap doesn't take much work especially if going through the "end-game" content. Lily rank returns in this game and obviously increases for the partners you choose to go in a dungeon together and as usual the higher the rank with said characters the more benefits they get when paired up. Trying to maximize Lily ranks however proves to be more work though than leveling.\nSupposedly with different Lily ranks per character you can press whatever button or key in the Lily rank menu and the selected pair will engage in small dialogue. If you've got the English dubbing off and can't understand Japanese, there aren't any subtitles to help for that since the dialogue itself is on-the-spot unlike the cutscenes that at least give you an idea of what they're saying if not something completely different because of the localization.\nApparently you can't pause during those VN cutscenes and can't rewatch them if you accidentally skipped 'em unless you've got a previous save in hand for the occassion.\n\nSo it's a badly localized, bare-bones action Nep game without a whole actual lot of Neps at least to give me a proper time with the addition of the usual repetition but with relatively more poor gameplay that more-or-less entices with characters being stripped when hit a lot, which in itself eventually becomes a bore. You can apparently be rewarded with clothing that doesn't break when equipped in case you get tired of the stripping and/or if you're a prude.","March 26","false","33.9"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","11","17","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/juicysupport/recommended/387340/","juicysupport","Yuki","http://steamcommunity.com/id/juicysupport/","500 products in account","This is my first Impression "Review" on Neptunia U after round 6 hrs.Note: While writing this review, there have been several people complaining about some issues. They might are going to be fixed, but at its current state (23.03.16) they are not!\n\nPort-Status:First of all, it is a PSVita port, so don't expect mind blowingly graphics! And as it is now, many people are having a Black-Screen or a flashing game while starting it up. Some people can continue to play their game since the Black Screen disappeared after a few seconds, but many people have to deal with a black screen and cannot play the game at all. However, this can be fixed by setting the game on window mode or borderless window mode, And also the steam overlay won't show up when certain video-material is displayed, for example the CompileHeart intro. The second big issue comes along with a some kind of blurry display. In my case, I first did not notice it at all. Only after several people have been reporting this issue i took a closer look to it. And it seems like the game itself is rendering in something lower or equal to 720p. Even if set the game resolution to 1080p. It stays blurry. Might be an issue with the engine, but i do not know, would just be speculations on my side there. However, since the game's highest resolution is 1080p you will have to deal with a blurry display. There are some "fixes" on the net which requires to download a program in order to be able to play the game with a clear vision. I have not tried this software, i just have found a Guide on Steam telling you about this and how to use it. However, I tried to find a workaround for the blurry screen on my own without using third party tools. Anyways, if you do not want to use a third party software then try this (Nvidia-Card required): Go to your Nvidia-Custom Settings. and Enable DSR use. Set it to 4x. Which means the game renders now in 4k and when you are having a 1080p screen like I do, it will downsample the game to 1080p. However THIS eliminates the blurry screen. As long as your GPU is strong enough ( I am using a GTX660 ) this could also be an option for you. There also have been people reporting that the voice files between english and japanese get mixed while gameplay. I did not notice that though, so I am not unaware in how much this is true. That's everything port wise, that you should know from the start! The Port-Status sounds pretty bad from this, but I would still say it is an ok-ish port. COuld be batter, no could be WAY better! But if you compare it to the other Neptunia games, you can notice an improovement. At least compared to Rebirth 1 &2. That's everything for now. For anyone else that is interested into the gameplay. The next paragraph is all about the gameplay!\n\nGameplay:HyperDimension Warriors is a Beat Em Up. You are going to battle with 2 of your Waifu 4Life against a horde of hundreds of enemies. Most of them die in a few hits, some even in one hit. Having high Stats through Leveling Up also helps killing them even faster. And that's probably about it. In the end you are nothing else doing then beating up about 300 monsters, then killing the boss of the stage and quest complete! ( with a few variations, you do this in any level ). After fighting you will get some Dialogues with the characters. Some funny. Some annoying. Some both. And some completely and absolutely irrelevant. Also the main selling point of the game is probably for some people the "costume break". Basically, your clothes are going to be ripped off by the enemies the more damage you take. In my experience, it was funny the first time. Okish the second time and after that just annoying.Luckily you unlock some clothes that are not "rip-off-able" or how the game stats it "fanservice-free". I also need to add, many people have been saying before release "The game is too easy", "Enemies attack you only all 30 seconds". And I can tell you, people who are saying this, are just liars. The game can be tough. If I haven't paid attention, the group of enemies did corner me and I went from 100% to 0% health in like 2 seconds. Just one thing, if you are not going to over-level yourself this game can be pretty challenging!\n\nConclusion: Sounds pretty repetitive right? Well, yeah it is. And sounds like you have to grind a lot, right? Uh yes, but... And sounds like a fanservice game for all Neptunia fans out there, or? .... Yeah it is, BUT it is a Dynasty Warriors clone. And I can easily say, if you love Dynasty Warriors games. If you love feeling OP. If you love grinding. If you love Neptunia. Then I can highly recommend you this game, even though you will have to deal with ALOT of issues if they are not going to be fixed!\n\nRating7/10","March 23","true","11.0"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

It has become something of a trend in recent years for all manner of series to have their own 'Warriors' spin-off.\nWhen it came to Neptunia's hack and slash spin-off, I anticipated something along the lines of the 'Dynasty Warriors: Gundam' series; lots of characters from the Neptunia francise, with the Lily Rank system following along the lines of DW:G3's operator system.\nTo put it simply, I expected to have more than ten characters; I was at least hoping a few Makers would be featured in this game. Perhaps it was naive of me to expect Compile Heart/Idea Factory to actually put some effort into their games, but I was trying to be optimistic about this game.\nAll that said, however, I was not massivly disappointed with this spin-off. The characters all use their Hyperdimension designs and personalities, all the CPUs are given some respect (even the Candidates, who seem to have become the series' chew toys as of late), there's around 10-15 hours of gameplay if you simply plough through it all, and the Lily Rank system was more fleshed out and entertaining than usual, with short voice clips available between all characters as their ranks go up.\nCharacters are hardly balanced, gameplay-wise. Vert is insanly mobile; Uni, Rom and Ram are highly mobile with long range attacks. This makes them more effective for most of the game, while Blanc and Noire are basically useless. Fortunatly, while Purple Heart is not as mobile as Vert, and Purple Sister use melee instead of ranged attacks, the Nep sisters are easily the most powerful characters(as they damn well should be.)\nI do appreciate that the designers bothered to make character designs and movests for Denkiko and Famistu(both of whom were previously Chirper-only characters) however, I was left to wonder why IF and Compa, who do appear in this game, are not playable. Again, this links back into the overall lack of Human characters here, but why put them in the game in the first place if you won't allow me to play as them?\nOverall, it's a decent hack and slash. Just don't expect too much from it, and try and purchase it while it's on sale.","May 15","true","26.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

The game itself I would highly reccommend especially to people who found the original series too grindy or hard for them to get in to.\n\nFor one there seems to be some compatibility issues with Windows 10, go figure. The game should auto run in compatibility mode for Vista but that means cutscenes run in a small box in the corner of the screen for me. Not terribly horrible as so far the only cutscenes have been the OP and the start up credits. And on top of that running it in windowed mode doesn't work. It just freezes at the OP and you can hear the menu running but can't see it. To fix this I just found my screenshot folder and used that to navigate to turn it back to full screen, because the screenshots show the menu. These problems, while annoying, don't bother me anymore.\nHowever I do have a weird frame rate issue where the frames keep dropping to around 30 and locking there and the game just runs horribly it was meant for 60fps action at half that your characters are in water. It doesn't do this in menus and everything else runs fine its only when i launch up the mission does this happen. Upon testing it seems to be the mobs causing this which for worse computers would make sense, but I can run the game fine at 60 with no issues. But every so often i'll launch the game up and this will happen. Sometimes just letting the game engine run with it will fix it, other times closing and going to do something else, for me it was pay Rebirth 1, and then going back fixed it. This keeps happening and while i'm happy its not permanent, it is a mild annoyance.\n\nLong story short, don't buy this game expecting a flawless port with no issues. Buy it because it's a great game that's tons of fun and be prepared to face these issues.","April 9","true","22.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/foxczer/recommended/387340/","foxczer","Han","http://steamcommunity.com/id/foxczer/","68 products in account","Not a bad game. As you might already know, the game is a spin off of the Hyperdimension RPGs. It plays like a mix of a Dinasty Warriors game and a tower arena game. It even does have a tower arena mode. I feel it could have been much more, though. Even if you try to balance thing out, as in, not getting your characters too overpowered, most enemies just stand still staring at you as you wack them with whatever attack you toss at them. As enemies go, the selection is as wacky as those found in the RPGs. From cats to penguins to dog headed jellies and even walking visual novel panels.\n\nThis game could have also benefited from a vs pvp online mode as it does already have the base for such outings. It has a stage that reminds me a lot of the Dragon Ball tournament arenas. Sure, it would have also needed proper skill balance between characters. Character selection is decent, but after awhile you will feel like you do the same with all of them. Your only options in the end are ranged or melee, cone AOE or centered AOE. There's also a cloth rip mechanic that acts as a buff at the cost of some defense. I personally felt the mechanic unnecessary. These are not really the kind of characters I'd prefer to see semi naked. They are just too much on the cute side for that(for my taste at least). Thankfully, as you progress through the game you can chose to either keep the mechanic, or wear unbreakable outfits, or wear an always torn outfit.\n\nThe game also has cheats you unlock as you complete things. While optional, activating them do not prevent you from doing achievements. Sure, this is helpful for the one very grindy achievement of filling all of the characters Lily friendship levels. Something that becomes very boring because of the game's lack of variety.\n\nNow, the things that do save this game and make me recommend it are the characters themselves. If you don't know what Hyperdimension is all about, the characters represent video game consoles of the modern era, like Playstation and XBox. Much of the dialogue is funny enough to cause chuckles. Though I lament that this game lacks more of these dialogues, like it's RPG counterparts. So even though I recommend this one,, you should go for the RPGs if you really want to enjoy funny comments and cameos.\n\nAll in all, this is a game that's not bad, but could have been much more. Pick it up when on discount.","April 12","true","39.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Happens every game, people can complain, but Neptunia fans really don't mind.\n\nAs for the game itself, it can get repetitive quick and difficulty mostly depends on how likely you are to find exploits or cheap set ups. Since the combos are so limited, it's not hard to run into a strong move and just spam it. If you wanted a better beat'em'up, there are plenty. Heck, there's Senran Kagura if you really wanted to keep the "clothing."\n\nPlot of it is really simple, maybe even lacking because of its length. It's a really short game with possibly more post game content than actual main story. Is it a good story though? "Meh". There are journalists who want to write an article and some monsters start showing up. They also really liked emphasizing the whole "little sister" thing with the CPUs and Candidates.\n\nBasically, only get it if you're a Neptunia fan or want a game where you can mindlessly alternate one or two buttons and get away with it like a casual. I'd hope the first one.","March 24","true","27.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

Look up some things on the game and thought it looked really fun, so I bought it.\nFrom my understanding, this series is an RPG series set to kinda make fun of the gaming industry, and contains many subtle-and not so subtle-nods to things (i.e characters named Famitsu and Dengekiko) and such, and, well..\n\nwao\n\nSo, what I really liked about this game is the fluent combat and the extremely colorful visuals, as well as the pretty cool characters (my fav character is probably Neptune, but my fav character to play as is Famitsu). The voice acting is pretty good, the dialogue and such is entertaining, the music is pretty cool and I like the change of tone when you transform into your HDD mode, and overall the game is quite fun to play. There's some pretty good character customization for each character and all characters except for Famitsu and Dengekiko start with 2-3 different outfit colors & hair colors for their normal and HDD forms, but you gain more weapons and such over time of playing.\n\nBut there are quite a few things that I absolutely hated about this game or just really didn't like; I feel like the sound design is absolutely terrible sometimes, most characters don't feel like they do much to enemies - like you're wacking things with nerf swords (with the exception of Dengekiko, Famitsu, and Blanc), some special attacks don't have sound effects or sound bland and boring even though they look flashy and cool af, and sometimes the enemies are a pain in the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. There've been multiple occasions where I'd get trapped in a circle of enemies that relentlessly obliterate both my characters in seconds without any hope of escaping. Also, sometimes it feels like the characters are really unbalanced, like how ranged characters transformed into their HDD mode are pretty much untouchable in most occasions. There isn't much of a story, but from what I've gathered, the main series has a much more involved story than this spin-off. One more thing, the combos feel a little strict and you won't find yourself straying from the same combos sometimes. Oh yeah, and there's a weird slow down when your framerate drops under 60FPS (don't worry, the game is reltatively easy to run, just run on lower resolution and/or windowed mode)\n\nIN CONCLUSION:\n\nPros:\n-Fun combat\n-Pretty visuals & flashy attacks and skills\n-Cool and relatively interesting characters\n-Pretty good music\n-Alright character customization\n-Interesting dialogue\n-Easy to run on lower-end computers (for me at least and I can barely run Tera and Skyrim)\n-( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)\n\nCons:\n-Awful sound design\n-Weird speed drop with framerate drop sometimes\n-Sometimes frustrating enemies\n-Meh story\n-Kinda unbalanced\n\nOverall, I feel this was one of the best games on steam that I've bought in quite a while.","March 24","true","13.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

Drops only happen when I get my camera behind a barrier, or if I stream the game via Steam streaming to my friends (drops to 30fps - game speed slows down, instead of skipping frames).\n\nVisuals:\nWell, some pictures are kinda blurry, which might be port's fault, but aside of that, game is very colorful.\n\nControls:\nI did already touch this in gameplay, but I gotta say, this game is totaly fine with a keyboard. Only problem I often have is a camera (I just don't touch it outside of reset camera button). Button mapping can be a pain at first, but after you learn keys,  it's easy. It is surely better with controler, but as someone who doesn't have one, I am glad I can play with my keyboard.\n\nOthers:\n- Storyline is same as you would expect from other Neptunia titles - Not really super serious, funny dialogue, likable characters.\n- Game also has a lots of Fan Service, which might be a pro or a con, depends on you. Anyway, cloth tearing can be disabled when your characters hits.. lvl 20 i think? You just need a "hard" outfit. Althrough it will remove a boost from teared clothes.\n- Also, game is full of reused assets (ASSets har har) you might know from Re;birth 1 or 2... but hey, they made a spin off out of it, and it is fun to play, so I have no problem with that.\n- Quests... well there could use some variety. Most of the time its just "Kill X monsters" or "Kill a boss" (which means you have to kill X monsters to spawn him). "Collect an item" is another "Kill a boss", but without "Kill X monsters".\n\n\nOverall its a very fun game and a great port with nice to look at combat. I would totaly recommend to at least try it (You can refund games in 2 hours anyway!)","March 26","true","24.3"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","7","12","0","0"

Gud stuff. But seriously though.\n\nTL;DR Quickshot\n\nPros:\n\n+Nep and company now in fast pace combat\n+Peformance compared to the rebirth series a huge improvement. I never saw a single frame drop that wasn't my fault, or something I was running in the background.\n+Fluid controls, solid movement.\n+Still good, totally, totally wholesome nep humor as with its previous games.\n+Oh yeah, clothes break now. Panties and bras galore. Good stuff.\n\nCons:\n\n-No real native support for gamepad, which the game was CLEARLY designed for. I mean, what the hell devs? It can still support controllers but don't expect a full support like it was on the PS VITA.\n\n- 8-Directional movement instead of full analog movement, this should not be a limitation with today's software and hardware progress, at all.\n\n-Game may be a bit grindy for the normal gamer but for anyone who's played JRPGS worth their salt, grinding's fairly normal and is not as bad as it looks.\n\n-Action and gameplay maybe repetitive but refer to my previous con remark above ^\n\n-No real new soundtracks other than maybe one or two at best.\n\n- The damaged clothing was kind of cool at first but it got annoying with further gameplay, luckily there is an option down the line, via events to remove this feature. Gotta say though... finally seeing Vert's panties was pretty good.\n\n-The game sometimes trips out and has issue of deciding to use the gamepad directional buttons or the directional keys on the keyboard. Rather annoying. It appears during Neptral Towers, postgame and namely during selecting and co‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing keybindings/gamepad.\n\n\nOther thoughts:\n\n? No Iframes when you get wailed on, so be mindful of slow attacks in a huge mob. You may die very, very quick.\n? Main/Side Quest indication is rather unclear so you may unknowingly miss out on an achievement because you went to the next chapter.\n? Did not experience AMD related problems as it ran flawlessly with no issues at all.\n? Rather poor imbalance moves for the nep girls so you may end up using just a few characters, rather than all of them.\n\n\nFinal Score: 8/10.  Great solid nep game, as the rebirth and these are. Sadly still plagued with controller support problems. May get a bit repetitive for some people but that's just fine with me.\n","March 28","true","35.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm quite happy with this game for a few reasons and I will explain them below.\n\nThis game was ported from the PS Vita and was developed by the same guys who brought us the Senran Kagura series. I LOVE the Senran Kagura series for the simplistic gameplay and the very well written story (Oh alright it's about the B00bs too) so how does this game hold up?\n\nThe story is simple. Two characters by the name of Dengekiko (Based on Dengeki magazines) and Famitsu (Based on Weekly Famitsu magazines) are having a battle for best reporter and best articles on the Gamindustri CPUs and CPU candidates. Soon something fishy happens and it's up to the total of Ten characters to find out what's wrong and save Gamindustri... again.\n\nWith writing this simplistic, it has to have a lot of charm, right? Yes. The charm of the characters shines as usual. The humor is well done as you hear lots of funny lines from the characters. Often making video game references and jokes. If you're firmiliar with the humor in Nep Nep games, you'll enjoy it even here.\n\n\n\nNow onto the gameplay. Is it good? Well yeah. It's pretty good but it definitely still has that Portable Game feel with short, easy to do quests and repetitive actions. Not that it's a bad thing. This simplicity makes the game PERFECT for quick play without struggle. Not overly hard and satisfying when you get a long combo string going.  Each character handling pretty well despite a couple handling the exact same way.\n\nEach quest can be taken on with a solo character or a two person team. Taking on quests with two characters is better for leveling up more characters faster. Each character also has an "HDD" form or Super mode to put it simply. This enhances the character by making them faster, stronger and gives them a different move set to play around with.\n\nIn the gameplay, there's enough here to keep you entertained.\n\n\n\nThe visuals are nothing too special but they get the job done with the bright and colorful look the Nep Nep games are known for. The characters look nice with the bright colors and all of them are adorable. Not too much to talk about here so we can just move on.\n\n\n\nThe sound is pretty okay with the voice acting and music being the best parts. The characters are fun to listen to and the soundtrack is well done even if quite a lot of the music is from the past Nep Nep games. This game also supports English and Japanese dubbing so there's a lot to love.\n\n\n\nOh yeah. There's a costume break system in this game! If you take enough damage, the character's clothes will rip and it's pretty revealing. Not a bad feature if you're into that sort of thing and yes, there is an option to give them clothes that don't break but it needs to be unlocked.\n\n\nOverall, this is a good game and there's enough content to play for quite a while. If you're into the gameplay style of Senran Kagura and like the humor of the other Nep Nep games, This game is something you'll enjoy.","March 29","true","12.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Story is non-canon and throwaway, but there are quite a few good jokes, fourth-wall breaks, and fun character interactions. Also, all of the main goddesses are very endearing, and the side-characters add their own personalities to the crew. Fan-service is turned up quite a few notches, and ripping outfits increase combat power substantially. Combat in the game is extremely easy, only a couple missions have any noticeable difficulty spikes. The post-game unlocks two new game modes, one of which is lackluster (would be AMAZING with multiplayer, however), and the other adds a lot of content to the game. All-in-all a fun addition to the Neptunia franchise, but definitely not essential.","April 18","true","27.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/weabsunite/recommended/387340/","weabsunite","Waifu-Sama","http://steamcommunity.com/id/weabsunite/","48 products in account","A Review On Hyperdimension Neptunia U Rating: 9/10\nThis was all around a great game. It's right down the alley for old fans of the series and new people who saw it pop up in their recommended list.\n\nGameplay\nUnlike the previous turn-based combat of the rest of the franchise to this date, Neptunia U takes the hack n' slash route of RPGs. Combat in Neptunia U is extremely satisfying for a few hours, but then kind of loses its novelty after that period of time. Eventually you find a broken combo on a broken CPU, say Blanc, and spam her X+X+X+X+Y+Y combo which absolutely destroys and nothing really happens, not to mention the CPUs and Candidates are nowhere close to being equal in strength, and here's a breakdown of their power.\n\n1. Neptune: She's the original MC of the series. Her X combo whilst in HDD does this insane AOE spin attack that destroys, whilst her non HDD form is simply forward directional attacks. Nothing special.\n2. Noire: One of my favorite characters, she is surprisingly less powerful than I expected. Whilst she can go toe to toe against most enemies, her Y, which is her few AOE wave clear attacks takes a while to set up, making her damage output less that some other characters'.\n3. Blanc: Some people hate on Blanc for having slow attacks, but on the contrary, her mobility combo in HDD of X+X+X+X+Y+Y makes her near untouchable and can deal 4000+ damage a hit at level 35. Blanc, at that point, is absolutely broken.\n4. Vert: One of the most OP characters, her Y combos in the middle of her X combos allows her to dash from place to place, making Vert unhittable.\n5. Nepgear: Her skill set is quite the same as Neptune's in HDD, but in her regular form, her X combo can extend a Y at the end which functions as a dash, much like Vert.\n6. Uni, AKA Skillshot God: Why is Uni called this? Well, all her attacks are very directional. Her Ys are, most of her Xs are, and in HDD, every single attack points at the first direction the first attack goes, especially in her X combo, allowing you to move and kite every single enemy, point the gun at them, and spam. Her Y is also broken AF but takes an insane amount of time to charge up, rendering it useless when she's crowded.\n7. Rom and Ram, AKA Spam Gods: I'm lumping them together due to their similar movesets. Most of their Xs in HDDs are directional, and the Ys are basically spam damage-all-enemies-in-a-huge-cone type attacks.\n8. Dengekiko and Famitsu: Wow, are these 2 journalists underpowered. I mean, I swear nobody uses them unless they have to. Their basics are weak, they have no mobility or surround AOE except for Dengekiko's Ys in combo with Xs or out.\n\nAnd of course, every Neptunia game has some broken item. In Neptunia 1, it was probably the Stamina Band that gave you 5000 extra health, in Neptunia 2 it was the FREE Gehaburn for Nepgear that let you one-shot every monster for at least 30 levels. In this game, it's that Scrambler Drive that allows you to, get this, instantly HDD at the beginning of every game. Couple that with the HDD gained from Costume Break, It essentially allows for each character you bring in to use their BROKEN AF EXE Drive twice. Wow.\n\nStory\nFor all of you long-time fans out there, you all know that Neptunia is a story-centered game. This game is chock full of the standard Neptunia humor. For all of you noobs out there, that includes the boob jokes, RIP Blanc Forever ;(, classic 4th wall breaks, which Idea Factory did a great job with, and the general personality of your favorite characters. However, the story is stretched a bit thin. The "Quests" in the game are the same thing, with "Irregular Quests" being the same thing but with special rules! Wow, originality. Not to mention that the story will only progress with the completion of these Irregular Quests. I was not nearly as engaged by the story in U than by the turn-based combat games, but after all, it's probably harder to time random dialogue sequences in the middle of an X combo, right?\nEven if the story is not as good as the previous ones, It is still good enough to keep me playing, and the humor makes it funny as well.\n\nThe Mechanical Bit\nThis section will include graphics, sound, all that stuff.\nGraphics:\nMuch like the rest of the games, the graphics are eh, good enough. The textures have been ripped straight from the other games and so were the enemies. Just look at the Rival Mech and Herobo from Neptunia 1, etc.\nSound:\nThough Idea Factory takes a lot of songs from the first games, like $100 and Nepgear's theme, I don't care, because those songs are great. The opening song is also what I've come to expect from these games, and Idea Factory once again delivers.\nOptimization and Hardware for all of you PC Nerds:\nI run an Nvidia GTX 970, and it works like a charm. 300+ FPS at the most lag-inducing times, and from what I've seen, it has worked on the equivalent of a mac. Good for Idea Factory, making their games playable.\n\nIn Summary: Whether you're a new person to the series, or a hardcore Neptunia fan who's in it for another game, like the rest coming out this summer (Victory II I'm looking at you), these Neps you're getting from this Nep is well worth the Neps spent on this Nep.\n\nNep.\n","June 4","true","9.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

LESS IS MORE!\nFinally, Neptunia spin-offs are starting to appear on steam. What that means is:\n1. More games for the fans and newcomers.\n2. ...Let's face it you're all here for the animu fanservice, aren't ya?\n\nStory\n\nRight of the bat the game informs you that it's a spin-off and the story is non-canon.\nDespite that the cast is still the same good ol' CPU goddesses and their sisters. They are accompanied by two journalists Dengekiko and Famitsu, and together they try to uncover a new Scoop. Yup, that's pretty much the entire plot.\n\nThe story's quite short, and unless you're playing the game once a week or so, you'll finish it in a jiffy.\n\nGameplay\n\nAs stated before, this is a spin-off. Instead of a JRPG, NepU is an Action Beat-'em-Up with RPG elements, it's quite fun. The controls are fluid. Characters have special skills, combos, transformations (just like before) , though the amount of combos could have been more varied.\n\nThe game also features the "Costume Break" system. It gives the characters a boost in stats... and it's for fanservice purposes too: get hit enough times and your controlled characters will get their costumes ripped to shreds with only a few scraps left to cover the goodies. Depending on whether you like the cutesy characters running around almost naked it's a hit or miss. Luckily the feature can be disabled midgame for those who don't like it.\n\nGraphics and Sounds\n\nThe game retains what is great about the previous Neptunia games - the colorful atmosphere, funky battlemaps to fight in and good looking character and enemy models (though a lot are the same as in the previous games from the franchise).\n\nThe soundtrack is typical Neptunia - Funky, with some 8bit mixed here and there followed by JRPG battle rock themes. I didn't get bored of those. (Some themes reused, but not a lot.) A great plus is that there is a sound gallery for listening to the previous Nep game tunes, great for relistening pleasure.\n\n\nProblems?\n\nA game can't have zero downsides right? Of course. There were reports of crashing, blurry 1080p graphics,sound, controller and performance issues on launch, luckily most of the issues were either fixed, or are easy to fix thanks to the community findings.\n\nAnother little problem that sparked some controversy in community discussions was the Costume Break, and how it looks "wrong" on the younger members of the cast (the Goddess' siblings), I can't say which side is right, but it's something to think about, as some parts of the world have very harsh laws regarding this topic.\n\nAnd finally probably the most talked problem - the difficulty. The game is well, too easy. Mobs can swarm you but they attack very rarily and deal insignificant damage, and even then you usually have a partner character that you can switch to. You can equip accessories that lower your stats yes, but that unnatural difficulty raising doesn't feel rewarding at all.\nOf course there are DLCs with harder quests, but by the time you get to them, the main story is finished, and unless you want to play more against one-shot mobs, those quests aren't worth the time.\n\nSummary\n\nNepU - the first Neptunia spin-off on steam started it off strong - a solid different genre game with it's own fickles and trickles. While it has some problems with it's low difficulty, fans of the franchise will enjoy it. And for those who are checking out this franchise just now, go ahead. Though you might want to wait for a discount if you're unsure if it's a worthy buy, though for a casual fun game - I recommend it.","April 26","true","38.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

LESS IS MORE!\nFinally, Neptunia spin-offs are starting to appear on steam. What that means is:\n1. More games for the fans and newcomers.\n2. ...Let's face it you're all here for the animu fanservice, aren't ya?\n\nStory\n\nRight of the bat the game informs you that it's a spin-off and the story is non-canon.\nDespite that the cast is still the same good ol' CPU goddesses and their sisters. They are accompanied by two journalists Dengekiko and Famitsu, and together they try to uncover a new Scoop. Yup, that's pretty much the entire plot.\n\nThe story's quite short, and unless you're playing the game once a week or so, you'll finish it in a jiffy.\n\nGameplay\n\nAs stated before, this is a spin-off. Instead of a JRPG, NepU is an Action Beat-'em-Up with RPG elements, it's quite fun. The controls are fluid. Characters have special skills, combos, transformations (just like before) , though the amount of combos could have been more varied.\n\nThe game also features the "Costume Break" system. It gives the characters a boost in stats... and it's for fanservice purposes too: get hit enough times and your controlled characters will get their costumes ripped to shreds with only a few scraps left to cover the goodies. Depending on whether you like the cutesy characters running around almost naked it's a hit or miss. Luckily the feature can be disabled midgame for those who don't like it.\n\nGraphics and Sounds\n\nThe game retains what is great about the previous Neptunia games - the colorful atmosphere, funky battlemaps to fight in and good looking character and enemy models (though a lot are the same as in the previous games from the franchise).\n\nThe soundtrack is typical Neptunia - Funky, with some 8bit mixed here and there followed by JRPG battle rock themes. I didn't get bored of those. (Some themes reused, but not a lot.) A great plus is that there is a sound gallery for listening to the previous Nep game tunes, great for relistening pleasure.\n\n\nProblems?\n\nA game can't have zero downsides right? Of course. There were reports of crashing, blurry 1080p graphics,sound, controller and performance issues on launch, luckily most of the issues were either fixed, or are easy to fix thanks to the community findings.\n\nAnother little problem that sparked some controversy in community discussions was the Costume Break, and how it looks "wrong" on the younger members of the cast (the Goddess' siblings), I can't say which side is right, but it's something to think about, as some parts of the world have very harsh laws regarding this topic.\n\nAnd finally probably the most talked problem - the difficulty. The game is well, too easy. Mobs can swarm you but they attack very rarily and deal insignificant damage, and even then you usually have a partner character that you can switch to. You can equip accessories that lower your stats yes, but that unnatural difficulty raising doesn't feel rewarding at all.\nOf course there are DLCs with harder quests, but by the time you get to them, the main story is finished, and unless you want to play more against one-shot mobs, those quests aren't worth the time.\n\nSummary\n\nNepU - the first Neptunia spin-off on steam started it off strong - a solid different genre game with it's own fickles and trickles. While it has some problems with it's low difficulty, fans of the franchise will enjoy it. And for those who are checking out this franchise just now, go ahead. Though you might want to wait for a discount if you're unsure if it's a worthy buy, though for a casual fun game - I recommend it.","April 26","true","38.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Sorta like the Dynasty Warriors games in which you fight hoards of weak enemies and then take on a stronger boss enemy. You know the deal. Lots of combos and special attacks. Has the HDD mode from the other games and ultimate attacks which are very nice to look at. There are a lot of extras as well like items to unlock, music mode, a pause menu that lets you rotate and zoom the camera to get that ideal screenshot of the action. Just an enjoyable experience all around.\n\nI am not even super into the series myself. Didn't even finish the first game even. But I did like the characters and the VN sections. I just could not get into the combat and slow pace of the game. Specifically the weird positioning in combat and the grinding. But this game kept all the good stuff and got rid of the boring combat! Luckily this is just a spinoff that can be enjoyed on its own. So if you want a little anime hack and slash action go ahead and check this out. It has fully voiced VN sections and Fun combat.\n\nNegatives would be the lack of graphics options. This is a Vita port though so it shouldn't be too hard to run or anything. But it would have been nice to have the basic graphics options for a PC game. I had another negative but I forgot what it is. I will edit later if I remember.\n\nSide note. The clothes tearing isn't such a big deal. Some people may be put off by it though. There is a way to get rid of it but you have to get beat up a few times before you unlock the unbreakable outfit. I don't even really notice it myself. You get the little splash when it happens then its business as usual. And the after battle close up but its like dude this series always had fanservice.","March 22","true","13.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

What's with the "U" in the title then?\n\nHyperdimension Neptunia U Action Unleashed will bring you action indeed. It's a "warriors" type game where you have hordes of enemies on screen and you do flashy combos and constant button mashing (X/Square/U are your friends). With ten characters to play as each with their own style of attacking, you'll want to try out many combinations and wipe the enemies clean. Of course in the original nature of the "warriors" game, it can get very repetitive. However, there is one thing I'm sure you're all here for that will actually wanna make you keep playing and not mind the repetitive nature, the Costume Break.\nYep, when your girls lose clothing, you'll end up wanting to keep playing because you're now given fanservice all the way to the end of the quest. Most of the enemies may look tame and not attack often, but they can still gang up in numbers and possibly land a ton of hits enough to rip your clothes apart (and in cheap cases for tough missions, knock you down faster than you can register as many X buttons). In fact, you can even find pre-torn clothes for the girls to wear and bam, instant fanservice from start to finish. Enjoy the jiggle physics as well!\nU probably are thinking right now, is this game worth it? Well, it's a pretty short and easy game that can be completed in 12-15 hours depending on your skills. There are a couple of post game content to keep you playing a bit longer and I appreciate that at least. And well, it's Neptunia, there's humour in the rather simplistic slice-of-life-esque story. But in the end, I still liked this game. Once you get used to the repetitive nature, you will find fun action and glorious fanservice to be had. U too may be able to have fun as well with Hyperdimension Neptunia U.","March 28","true","39.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

Instead of a dialogue heavy JRPG you get a hack and slash beat 'em up that reminds a bit of dynasty warriors.\n\nCombat and controls are pretty good, but not as fluid as a proper platformer like devil may cry or bayonetta. The game is played through lists of missions which lets you skip around and replay as you choose. Dialogue is heavy at first, then extremely sparse.

But wait! This time it's a Hack'n'Slash ARPG instead of the traditional RPGs that Neptunia players are so accustomed to. So... How is Hyperdimension Neptunia U: Action Unleashed?\n\nFirst things first, the gameplay is rather smooth with natural combos - this is coming from a player who is absolutely trash at action games and prefers to stick to turn-based RPGs, so little issue there. The game runs rather well, even without a high-end setup, though some may find the graphics lacking as compared to other Neptunia titles.\n\nThe aim of the game is to select up to two characters from the roster (CPUs, Candidates as well as 2 new characters) and slash your way through hordes of familiar Neptunia foes. By performing combos, the EXE gauge fills up, eventually enabling the use of HDD, which transforms the character and boosts their stats and granting new combos. That said, this system is simple but rather robust. Another "unique" aspect of HDU is the addition of "Costume Break", which is basically  a system that reduces characters' clothing as they get hit. Less clothing results in a loss of defense but offensive stats increase. Seems somewhat unnecessary, but hey. It is what it is -.^*\n\nCustomization is similar to the older titles, bringing back some of the costumes from previous Neptunia games. More of a just-for-fun aspect that enables you to make your Neptunia Goddesses look the way you like them. Weapons and Accessories can be swapped out, so theoretically it's possible to challenge yourself considering the games' difficulty isn't all that high (especially compared to the grind factor in previous turn-based RPG titles). But this is a Neptunia game, these games aren't all that hard anyway.\n\nStill the same old RPG x Visual Novel we all know and love however, with a storyline that seems much quirkier than the traditional games, but still filled with fourth wall breaking and Nepnep style humor nontheless. Always fun to read through (plus, as usual, Japanese voices are included if you so desire).\n\nOnly issues so far are some constant crashes seemlingly due to various reasons and some minor gameplay elements including difficulty. Overall a fun title for Neptunia fans, so long as you don't hate ARPGs or dislike the Costume Break mechanic.","March 21","true","2.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

So,.... Yay!!!^^\n\nThe game itself feels quite polished for a Neptunia game, but it's also shorter and less "complex" than the previous titles.\nVisuals are ok, most 3D assets were recycled from Rebirth1/2/3 anyway (the "HD"-textures, models and animations are "of course" even older), a quite convenient "running gag" with the Neptunia series.\nSomehow the effects during fights look a bit nicer than in Victory.\nMaybe they sacrificed a couple more minutes of their precious time to tweak the shaders, or maybe the game simply runs really well with the current Nvidia drivers. Who knows, and who cares.\n\nThe game goes really easy on my hardware, my primary GTX970 doesn't even bother to power up beyond P2 state and gives me constant 60 fps at 20-30% load, while my second 970 sleeps through all the action that is unleashed. CPU load is even less noteworthy. So, while the first "rebirth" tried to hog more resources than it deserved, this port seems to be far better optimised and will probably run smoothly on many laptops and older desktop rigs.\n\nI use a XBoneOne controller, which is imo the best input device for games of this series, but mouse support seems to be further improved as well. ( by which I mean precision and input lag, you still have to manually edit the config file and add your desired key bindings, so a gamepad is still the way to go )\n\nThe rest is simply what you'd expect from a Neptunia game. Nerdy japanese humor, parodies and game references, lots of fanservice and yuri subtext,.. and of course the characters don't just occasionally break the fourth wall, they once more tear it down right from the start.\n\nSo, yeah... it's a Neptunia game, which means it's as charming as it is flawed.\nA bit simpler and faster paced than the other games of the series, but basicly   moar  Nep Nep .\n\nAnd like any Neptunia/ Idea Factory game this title is also rediculously overpriced.\nI picked it up for 17‚Ç¨ (-40% promotion offer), which imo should be the regular price.\nMaybe even a bit less.\nNeptunia games are fun and entertaining with well written cute waifus, that's why we still buy them.\nBut even if you can create halfway decent sequels by simply writing new dialogue and recycling 99% of the 3D assets,\nneither does it mean that you should, nor that such a garage kit game build is worth half the price of a AAA title.\n\nSo yes, buy it, it's a fun game like the other Neptunia titles, but buy it when it's on sale for half or less.\nEven if it's not about the money because you're super rich or whatever, be patient and do it for the statement^^.","March 25","true","40.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

So,.... Yay!!!^^\n\nThe game itself feels quite polished for a Neptunia game, but it's also shorter and less "complex" than the previous titles.\nVisuals are ok, most 3D assets were recycled from Rebirth1/2/3 anyway (the "HD"-textures, models and animations are "of course" even older), a quite convenient "running gag" with the Neptunia series.\nSomehow the effects during fights look a bit nicer than in Victory.\nMaybe they sacrificed a couple more minutes of their precious time to tweak the shaders, or maybe the game simply runs really well with the current Nvidia drivers. Who knows, and who cares.\n\nThe game goes really easy on my hardware, my primary GTX970 doesn't even bother to power up beyond P2 state and gives me constant 60 fps at 20-30% load, while my second 970 sleeps through all the action that is unleashed. CPU load is even less noteworthy. So, while the first "rebirth" tried to hog more resources than it deserved, this port seems to be far better optimised and will probably run smoothly on many laptops and older desktop rigs.\n\nI use a XBoneOne controller, which is imo the best input device for games of this series, but mouse support seems to be further improved as well. ( by which I mean precision and input lag, you still have to manually edit the config file and add your desired key bindings, so a gamepad is still the way to go )\n\nThe rest is simply what you'd expect from a Neptunia game. Nerdy japanese humor, parodies and game references, lots of fanservice and yuri subtext,.. and of course the characters don't just occasionally break the fourth wall, they once more tear it down right from the start.\n\nSo, yeah... it's a Neptunia game, which means it's as charming as it is flawed.\nA bit simpler and faster paced than the other games of the series, but basicly   moar  Nep Nep .\n\nAnd like any Neptunia/ Idea Factory game this title is also rediculously overpriced.\nI picked it up for 17‚Ç¨ (-40% promotion offer), which imo should be the regular price.\nMaybe even a bit less.\nNeptunia games are fun and entertaining with well written cute waifus, that's why we still buy them.\nBut even if you can create halfway decent sequels by simply writing new dialogue and recycling 99% of the 3D assets,\nneither does it mean that you should, nor that such a garage kit game build is worth half the price of a AAA title.\n\nSo yes, buy it, it's a fun game like the other Neptunia titles, but buy it when it's on sale for half or less.\nEven if it's not about the money because you're super rich or whatever, be patient and do it for the statement^^.","March 25","true","40.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/YodaZXY/recommended/387340/","YodaZXY","Hyperactive Zergling","http://steamcommunity.com/id/YodaZXY/","260 products in account","So i just beat this game, and here's my checklist for whether or not you will want this game.\n\nYou will like this game if:\n-You were/are a fan of the hyperdimension neptunia series\n-You like Dynasty warriors/ Hyrule warriors eseque gameplay\n-You aren't looking for a particularly in depth story\n-You want to turn your brain off, bash some trash mobs and listen to the BGM\n-Idk, maybe your just here for the fanservice, which is literally just canned stripping animations and less clothing\n\nYou will not like this game if:\n-You are looking for a game that has any sort of replayability or multiple endings(only has one ending)\n-You are looking for a game that is long-lasting or has varied gameplay (game lasts about 14hours if you do all of the side missions, around 8 if you just bum rush the main story)\n-You are looking for a good hack-n-slash game. Its an average hack-n-slash game with a plethora of colors and like a hundred enemies on the screen at any given time\n-You are looking for a challenging video game. You could probably beat this game whilst playing tetris.\n\nAlright, now on to the actual reveiw, which  will include more specifics on what the game does, how it is similar and differnt to the main game series, writing style, and other random gripes and praises. Warning: Word soup ahead\n\nReview\nFirst off, the main allure of every hyperdimension neptunia game is the characters, as they are fairly quirky and funny takes on various sterotypes and are generally quite funny. This game... it seems to have forgotten part of that, as eveything that makes the characters who they are is dulled out a little bit presumably because there is less dialouge to work with, meaning the character's individual personalities are shown 75% less and instead is replaced by inter-character interactions... Which would be great if only there was, i don't know, an actual REASON for the characters to interact? like a conflict of interest? or literally anything other than a random string of jokes, compliments and backhanded insults? A huge part of what made following the character development in the main games was the fact that they were faced by a tangible conflict in the form of other characters and subsequently overcame that and became friends/ tentative allies. This game has none of that and instead mostly replaces it with proof of character relation, which basically means the games spends a lot of time talking about how the characters interact with each other, but in a very one-directional way. so yeah thats my veiw on the overall writing style and no, i'm not going to comment on the fact that some of the lines are literally just super-cringeworthy memes. Moving on, the next thing i found intruiging is how they modifyed all of the assets from the main game( everything from game mechanics to maps) and how some of it was good, some of it just weird. The good part is that they made all of the various stats streamlined AF so you dont really have to think to hard about your strategy for hitting things, as well as the way the various meters(SP and EXE) are made easy to manage in a 3d fast-paced game enviroment. I also really like how they did the menus: if i needed to check something, it took like 3 clicks tops. Now the weird parts  are the map implementation and the enemy aggro mechanic. The maps are pretty much copy-paste from the main games, except they added barriers that basicly just railroad you down a single path, which would be fine if these maps served as awesome arenas, but they dont(in fact in some cases you wonder how in the world your supposed to fight in such cramped spaces). However, this problem is partially alleviated due to the inclusion of a few actual arena levels with lots of space, which i thought were the most enjoyable levels. Second flaw is kinda minor in that the enemy aggro ranges dont work right half the time, they suffer from the same problem the enemies in the main series did in that if you do anything but walk in a straight line they lose sight of you and just sit there for like a whole 5 seconds before noticing you again. Again, minor problem that only really presents itself if you try and kite a group for a mass wipeout. Next up, character imbalance, which i realize has existed in the past games and directly corellated with the characters confidence/skillset(which was awesome by the way) but it just doesn't mesh well in the genre because you cant have the party protect the weak character anymore, they are at the mercy of stun-locks and crazy high dps and there isn't ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• you can do about it. For example, Rom and Ram are made as glass cannons in terms of stats... except that every other character is a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing railgun in comparison, complete with reinforced metal plating. This differentiation leads to an unavoidable gap in how fun it is to play one character(the OP one) vs the other(the weaksause character), and thats a problem beacuse the game requires you to use every character every now and then. Next on the chopping block: the story. The ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing "story". want me to sum it up for you? You go and fight a big mech. The end. If you didn't read that spoiler, then just take my word for it: It is more threadbare then the characters after the "outfit break" which is a problem because, as I pose at the begining of this giant ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing text wall, this game is about character, but also what the characters do and how they do it. Also, there are points in the writing were it uses taletale signs of leadup, like characters worrying about something hyper-specific or various off-handed would-be foreshadowing, and then does nothing with it and just sort of moves on. Anyways, my next point is the items and equipment system, aka kill stuff and get stuff. Yeah, it does away with the JRPG shop system in the main game and instead uses a medal system where you kill monsters and unlock gear in unlimited supply for all characters. The pro to this is, as mentioned before, stats become easy to manage. The bad part is that customization is narrowed down to which cosmetic outfit your character wears beacause the stat items uprade super linear-like, "A is better than B in every way" style. Overall, i feel like the system could  have been a lot more fleshed out, but at least it works(i guess). Finally, the moment you probably would be waiting for if you haven't left already: The combat and challenge. So, as you probably read on the store page, your clothes are not that of Geralt of Rivia whose silken cloth can witstand dragonfire. No, instead they will eventually rip and tear, resulting in fanservice, and(if your me) increased crit rate, EXE drive increase and increased damage recieved. Know how many characters fighting style this fits like a glove? All but 2, those being Rom and Ram, because they have low health and high base crit rate to begin with. This means that the game is mechanicly encouraging you to lose your clothes as it were, and gives you bigger numbers when you follow along, which i guess is to be expected of a mechanic of this variety. BUT this mechanic actually create a weird problem in that it locks the player into an aggressive playstyle because it is so disproportiontly rewarded. As a direct result, the already repetitive gameplay that is dynasty warriors punchy punchy is made even more one-dimensional due to the fact that you pretty much have to play it out in the same style everytime. Maybe this isn't a problem for you because your attack plan is always aggro, but many people like to play hack and slash cautiously, setting up for big efficent mass wipes by kiting and getting out of the way and turning into a damage sponge. Ok, now that that word pudding is done, time for me to talk about the challenge of the game. Basiclly, unless you equip that one item that makes you weak as paper  or go into a quest that is a much higher level, the game hands you victory for free.\n\nThat concludes this reveiw. Final verdict: its ok","March 23","true","14.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

Nothing revolutionary, but ok.\n\nMy original score for the Ps Vita it's an 8 but for PC a 6.5. Why? Well because to this day is that !F can't get their games working at 100% on many systems. In my case, I have small graphics glitches on the mini map and some times at the top/bottom of the screen but other users can't even run the game or have a banana show of glitches.\n\nSo there you have it. I recommend this game for now BUT we warned of this problems before hitting that buy button.\n\nCheers.\n\nPS: Oh, and in case you want to see some gameplay on PC here you go. ‚ñ∫ https://youtu.be/8rtZemKvQFI","March 24","true","24.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

A port of the Vita game. All characters have light/strong attacks, aerial combos, special attacks (a.k.a SP Skills), and a temporary transformation ability (HDD/CPU mode) which changes up some moves and increases the character's power and survivability. Characters may use a powerful super ability (EXE Drive) once transformed which will revert them to their regular state. You build SP and meter by landing attacks. You usually have to kill everything in an arena to win. You can take two characters into battle and swap between them as necessary. The game encourages you to swap by filling the transformation meter of the inactive character first, then for the active character.\n\nThe playable characters are the CPUs who have CPU Candidates, and the CPU Candidates themselves, plus Famitsu and Dengekiko. Characters gain EXP and level up, increasing their stats. Killing monsters nets you medals for each type of monster (Dogoo, Pixelvader, etc.) which you can trade in for permanent stat boosts, equippable stat items, or weapons. Also, as two characters complete battles, their friendship rank (Lily Rank) goes up, conferring bonuses to each character. You also get costumes, and a sound test mode.\n\nStory's your standard Neptunia fare of "evil thing appears, go murder it". The writing is very similar to the main Neptunia games and the characters retain their personalities. Once you finish the main quests, you unlock a tournament mode, and then a 100-floor tower to work up.\n\nThe port has a 60 FPS lock. It will at times slow to below that for a few seconds, usually after many particle effects, or switching windows. The game runs natively at 720p, causing blurry assets, but can run at 1080p with better anti-aliasing using durante's GeDoSaTo program. The options menu is extensive for a port, and can be viewed on the PCGamingWiki[pcgamingwiki.com]. This is on an i7-2600k with a GTX 660Ti.\n\nSome PositivesCharacters all control tightly thanks to the decent framerate.\nTsunako's character art is stellar as always.\nParticle effects are good-looking and not overly taxing.\nCharacter models are good quality.\nMusic is cheery when it needs to be, and omnious when it needs to be.\nPort is rock-steady and well done considering the source.\nSmashing hordes of monsters feels good in a musou-game kind of way.\nEach character's personality comes through in their unique moveset and combat quotes.\nSurprising amount of items to unlock for min/maxing purposes.Some NegativesRanged/Spellcaster characters are extremely overpowered compared to the melee characters due to how hitstun works and how enemies tend to swarm you in melee range. Monsters will likely never touch a ranged character if played properly. It certainly feels bad when you avoid using your favourite character because she's objectively worse.\nThe L button centers the camera. The X button is the light attack. L+X activates EXE Drive, nukes the screen, and knocks you into your regular mode. It's a pain.\nL must be held for a second to center the camera. Tapping won't do. This has no place in an action game.\nTwo parts of the game are left untranslated, probably because they had no subtitles. The tournament commentary, and the Lily dialogue between characters.\nTournament mode is a waste of time. The game is clearly not balanced so one-on-one combat ends pretty quickly.\nSpeaking of on-on-one combat, sometimes the game ropes you into fighting lone minibosses/bosses. The game is clearly not designed for this.\nOne ranged enemy type fire projectiles that will stunlock you into oblivion. There are no recovery i-frames to thwart this.Some Things To Read And Decide For Yourself If You LikeThe localized English is very, very liberal with their translation. If you actually know Japanese you'll probably find yourself sliding a Glock between your teeth during extended cutscenes.\nYou will do a lot of the same thing over and over.\nYou might not want to let people watch you play this.\nLow skill ceiling. For melee characters, you figure out the optimal combo with the widest area of effect and least hitlag, then enter HDD for the rest of the quest. For ranged/casters, you enter HDD as soon as possible and fire while moving.\nRom and Ram are basically the same character save minor changes in moveset and the behaviour of their projectiles in HDD. I know they're similar according to the lore but they could have played up Rom's affinity for ice magic and Ram's strength a bit more.\n\nEither way, if you like the characters this is a way to finally see them in action. The combat is decent enough, and smashing monsters with Neps doesn't really get old if you have a good podcast on.\n\nHope this helped.\n\nReminder that Nepgear did nothing wrong.","April 22","true","21.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Seriously. This game is the definition of mediocrity and monotony. It isn't really bad but there are just flat out better games that are more worth your time. Let me just list the pros and cons to make it simple.\n\n+Pros+Typical Neptunia conversations and humor : either a pro or a con based on your tastes\n\n+Just the right length (If you just play the story mode) : The story mode only barely feels like it is getting too drawn out. It feels more average and bland the more you play though.\n\n-Cons-SO GRINDY : To finish the extras in this game, you have to grind with every possible character pair and beat the same 50 floors 5 seperate times. I feel like over 20 of my hours are just grinding this stupid tower and trying to get these lily ranks.\n\n-SUPER EASY : Just mash a button to win. Go HDD with Rom and mash the standard attack button. Your HDD gauge will never go down. Trust me on this. This strategy works for most characters. AND THEN YOU HAVE TO DO THE TOWER. YOU WILL (and I know you will) TURN ON CHEATS TO MAKE IT GO FASTER BUT IT ONLY MAKES IT EASIER AND MORE BORING.\n\n-The mechanics never really change : You unlock very few new skills and the game isn't deep enough to satisfy for the 30 hour grindfest.\n\n-I AM INSANE : I HAVE NEARLY 100%ED THIS GAME.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zurarara/recommended/387340/","zurarara","Aruz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zurarara/","308 products in account","TL;DR: It sucks. Details below. Only buy it if you're a Neptunia fan that feels the need to play all the games. If you like this type of combat game, just wait for Senran Kagura since that's the much better original this game is trying to rip off.\n\nThis game does not deserve the high review rating it has. Don't buy this game. I'll start with the positive things about the game, because they run out quick.\n\n1. Game runs at a solid 60 fps and looks decent\n2. The combat is fun for a while. Animations are great, some characters play really smoothly.\n3. The dialogue is still the usual we've come to enjoy\n4. Appearance customization is nice\n\nNow for the bad things, in order of importance:\n\n1. Weaker story/dialogue than the other games. A lot of charm in the Neptunia games comes from the dialogue between characters. The way this game is set up, that happens a lot less frequently. It's just quest after quest after quest and then eventually you'll get something, and the cycle repeats. If the dialogue was good/frequent enough, it would make the game bearable. Unfortunately it isn't.\n\n2. Holy hell is this game grindy. Every quest, no matter what kind of "twist" they try to put on it, is the same: kill a bunch of enemies. Some take forever to die, the bosses take forever to spawn, missions take a long time for no reason at all. Achievements are even worse. For example, Neptral Force requires you to play through 50 floors 5 times, since the requirement is to beat all 50 with all 10 characters (it's only 5 times because you can run through it in pairs).\n\n3. The combat gets boring quick. It's fun at first, but you do so much of the same so often you'll eventually get sick of it. It's even worse if you want all the achievements, since that requires you to do\n\n4. Enemies have no variety. They are all exactly the same, you never change your strategy for any of them, they just look different. And the health bars are damn near invisible so you can only tell if you killed something by the death sound which gets annoying when repeated.\n\n5. The game is not hard at all. This makes it feel even more like a chore because since it's so easy, you'd wish it goes by faster, but it doesn't.\n\n6. The quest layout isn't optimal. Ideally, it would list quests by level or quest type. Instead, it separates each quest by map (the maps do not affect gameplay enough to warrant this), making finding level-appropriate quests incredibly annoying.\n\n7. Equipping accessories is annoying. Since in this game you can only send out 2 people at a time, there's no need for items to be limited. That means equipping accessories on one person won't prevent someone else from equippping it. The problem with this is that there's basically no reason for anyone to have different loadouts, yet they do, so it takes like 5 minutes to change everyone to the same loadout.\n\n8. While the game looks decent, it's just upscaled 720p. There's a mod to fix this, but we shouldn't have to install a mod for this sort of thing. Resolution won't go higher than 1080p either.\n\n9. The music is not fitting in the least. Since they're just using tracks from the previous games, sometimes they'll stick an unfitting track on an unfitting map. This is a battle game yet you'll have non-battle music playing all the time, it's oddly distracting.","April 30","false","7.5"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

(It's basically charge for a special attack if you don't know what it is.)\n\nIf you are a fan of the series and don't mind hack and slash gameplay then I reccomend this game, controls are different from the other games but like the other games, the controls grow on you and are easy to remember.\n\nBeing a new release, expect it to have several glitches and errors, I had to re-download the game because the first time I set the resolution to 1920x1080 and full screen and it deleted the .exe file, but apart from that I've not seen any other game breaking issues.\n\nOf course this review is not finished and will be seeing updates but so far it is a pretty good change from the JRPG style and still maintains the Hyperdimension atmosphere and blahblahblah Nep-Nep everyone!","March 21","true","12.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It gets old real fast, though, seeing their clothes get ripped up, so you can equip your characters with unbreakable versions of their costumes. I did that for a while because I just wanted to kill cute things as cute girls, but then I was missing out on getting the boosts afforded from costume breaks, so I put the breakable ones back on.\n\nI don't know what to say about this game. It's short, it's goofy, and just like the original Hyperdimension Neptunia Rebirth 1, I ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing can't stand the "story" and pointless dialogue. The story isn't remotely compelling and that's obviously not the point, but nothing about it makes you curious about what will happen next. Thankfully the dialogue is kept shorter than usual, and for Hyperdimension standards, that's all I can ever ask for because in the other game, they just took waaaaaaaay too long to finish talking about...I can't remember. That's how bad the dialogue is.\n\nI can see how others might find the 4th wall breaking funny and the cuteness exchange, but it's not for me.\n\nThe first half of the game you're given an over abundance of quests to complete and you go at them at your own leisure. Which ones to do first and which characters to do them with. The only reason why I played for 10 hours is because I do like the hack n slash battle system, and I was worried at first about it being too easy of a mash fest, but there are times where you do get challenged. Not so much that you sweat bullets, but enough to grab your attention back from basically mentally checking out to start paying attention to your spacing amongst the hordes of enemies.\n\nYeah, that's what this game is good for. If you want mindless fun, play it. Turn your brain off and mash buttons and occassionally use the dodge button to get out of "tough" spots.\n\nThe sound bothers me, by the way. The music is fine and the voice acting is okay, but god the monster voices are annoying, and thankfully you can turn them off. But then all you're left with his hollow sound effects that don't make your attacks feel impactful despite of the physical force they cause in pushing enemies away. Then there's one real time cutscene that isn't in visual novel form and the mech monster was just silent. I had to close the game and turn it back on with allowing monster voices just to hear pointless stereotypical bad guy monologue.\n\nI DON'T KNOW! I don't know why I ever bother with the Neptunia games. They're like one night stands that feel like a good idea at the time, but you regret it afterward. Great action, but nothing fulfilling to the mind or heart. I got this game for $20 because I did enjoy the visuals and the gameplay, but it left a lot to be desired. This game is good for $5, I would say, not at all worth the full price.\n\nI would only gladly, without regret, pay full price for the next Action Release game IF the developers do the following:\n\n- Have some more structure in tackling quests. Maybe one quest unlocks another rather than having a long list of them to do.\n- Quest variety. How sad is it that I felt relief in a fetch quest of picking up treasure chests that didn't really give me any real items?\n- The FIRST quest felt good in that you had to beat one part of the map to advance to the next, so why didn't the rest of the quests have that?! It was bland, but way better than being confined to ONE battle arena per quest with only a tiny option to move to another part of it.\n- Rebirth 1 was fun for the customization of your characters and dungeons from item collection and crafting. That would be nice to put into this hack n slash spin off.\n- Also, it wouldn't hurt to have more SP skills so it felt meaningful to go to the set up options and equip your characters with the moves you want instead of simply just having 3 per character.\n- Combos should have more customization. Throughout the whole game you have the exact same combos from when you start. I think it'd be better if you earned more moves as you leveled up or even had the option, like in Rebirth 1, to customize different moves you want to have in each link of a combo chain.\n- New monsters. PLEASE! Keep the ones they already have that's fine, but have some monsters that are the same size as the characters and more intimidating than a blob with a happy face. Killing those don't feel satisfying.\n\nIn conclusion, I don't play Hyperdimesion Neptunia games for what they are, I play them for what they could be: solid JRPG's with enough depth that you'd really need a long rope to get out of the deep chasm of customization. But that's not what these games are. They are a shallow waste of time and I have voluntarily wasted my time this week playing a game that has the potential to be so much more.","March 29","false","14.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Even the most hardcore of Neptunia fans are going to find a breaking point much sooner than they realize, the game is just that boring.  It isn't bad, but it gets really boring really quickly.\n\nIt all started with the Costume Break system, where even Neptune in-game says it's "the game's selling point," and boy did Idea Factory sell their cast out.  I'm no prude, I'm actually quite a perv by normal standards, but even I realize that it's all glitz and glamour meant to cover up the game's lack of story, strategy and even soul.  The hodgepodge of challenge combinations aren't at all interesting, which is a crying shame considering just how clever Neptunia's writers and designers can be (empahsis on can).\n\nEven if Neptune is your actual wife, this game just isn't good.  No amount of fanservice, and this is probably Steam's instant-gratification fanservice simulator 2016 GOTY, will cover up the literally sleep inducing gameplay nor reward you with any more desireable T&A that you can't find on the internet's finest Hentai sites.","March 21","false","23.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","2"

I guess? for a Hack n' Slash game it's felt kinda weird to me.\nThe control is good. but the combat isn't that great but since it is a Hack n' Slash game that got ported from  the PSVita, I can forgive that...... I'm just kidding this game combat is very bad!\nThere's combo like other H&S but it seems pretty useless. Heavy Attack isn't really heavy (Unless you want to unclothes the girls then go ahead :V), Transformation is good and all you can keep it permanant by spamming the hell out of the button ,but in the other hands EXE Drive feels... Uhh Weak... It's a "Finisher" and can be you in HDD forms but after that the gauge will be depleted... so My option is always keeping my HDD on until the end of the wave :V\nand I literally laugh my ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• off when I picked Blanc for the first time... her attacks is slow (Because it's a hammer she's weilding) but the damage isn't that High or an different as Noire who swing faster. SO character balanced is a bit issue too...\n\n\nIn case you don't get my point. I don't recommend this game for you casual player out there!\nEven if you are a Neptunia fans! Seriously this game is really bad!!!\n\n\nbut this game brought my attention because of Dengekiko which use a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing RAILGUN! attack\nand that's why my final rating for this game... is a Spamming/10 (ProJared Reference go watch him :P)","March 27","false","7.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

So, if you're looking for a quick summary of what the game is, expect it to play like a less polished Senran Kagura game that's gone through a HDN reskin, yet doesn't have any of HDN's writing and humor chops.\nNow, if you are a HDN fan and are looking for a button mash-y hack-n-slash game that you can pick up once in a while for half an hour to an hour and put right back down, presuming you can get this game on a sale and can put up with the awful camera controls, this will be a great fit.\n\n--\n\nNow, for a more thorough examination.\n\nPros:\n-The combat is simple and straightforward. Mashing light attack and occasionally popping off a special move will get you through basically the whole game, which is great, if all you want to do is unwind and turn off your brain.\n-On most missions, you are free to play as your favorite combination of CPU and/or CPU Candidate. Nepgear and Rom? Vert and Uni? Neptune and Blanc? Go nuts!\n-The title runs perfectly fine and supports full 1080p. It also seems to control just fine with either keyboard or controller (note: I've only used my 360 pad. I presume it has solid DirectInput support since the games hail from Sony consoles, but I'm not 100% sure).\n-All quests list their level requirements, so you'll know if you're about to get some much needed stress relief out of colorful monsters or be pounded into mulch.\n\nCons:\n-The writing and humor. I don't know if it's just bad writing or a localization issue from the game being caught in the petticoats of the western nanny-states, but... Based on my experience with the HDN series, this was a big beacon that this was handled by someone else. If you've ever played a Senran Kagura game, it's about on par with that. If you haven't, just pretend that there is no story.\n-I know that character balance isn't very big in hack-n-slash titles, but... There are certain characters that you'll bring out for certain quests and otherwise never touch again.\n-Maybe, I'm just spoiled by the PC ports made by IF and Compile Heart, but... Somehow, the options menu is inferior to what you usually see on Vita or 3DS titles. Yes, you get windowed, fullscreen, and borderless windowed support up to 1080p, but... There's nothing above that, there's no graphical options what's-so-ever, and there isn't even an option to toggle how quickly you want the text to be displayed on the screen and are locked to the slowest pace in existence.\n-My biggest gripe of all, though, is the camera. First of all, it drunkenly swings around, with the options making it far too rigid or much too loose. Also, unlike the other HDN titles I've played, there's no way to zoom the camera out, so I hope that you like having your camera be close enough to your character's head that you may as well be able to reach in and pick bits of dandruff out of their hair.\n\nEdit: Rephrased TL;DR.","April 10","false","5.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There are a small handful of missions that are gems making you have to do something else but are to far apart and never come back around really, the story along you can blast through in less then 20 hours easy, there's content after the story such as a tournament battle and an endless dungeon but its all a lot of fluff and filling, honestly this game felt more like Neptunia fan service, that part especially being the case with he whole costume break thing, during combat if you take to much damage your characters costume will break, this has benefits but is ultimately not as good for scores at the end of the mission, and getting a costume break is far to easy to let happen, and with more then half the characters seems so very wrong, only like one or two characters really are made for this, but in all honestly its really just a bunch of panty shots.\nHonestly as much as I love the neptunia game series this one is just plan bad, not worth your money unless you want a quick mindless game and it's on a major sale, or your a pervert that loves to see young girls in there panties and shredded clothing.","April 15","false","13.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

A bit hard to begin with, because it's not the same type as the re;birth series, but you learn pretty fast how to control the characters. Since it's a hack'n slash, fights are really fluid. You don't have to wait for your turn, and it surpringly works really well on my computer while I have the lowest configuration (I can easily reach 60 FPS, while I had to stick with 15-20 in Re;Birth 2). Of course, you can only control one character at a time, but again the fluidity helps you get over it, and fights quickly become easy to handle.\n\nSecondly, the characters. Such a pleasure to see again all the CPUs and CPU Candidates, with their usual talks and personalities (I wouldn't have mind seeing more of Blanc's cute persona). And a big plus since the game is FULLY voiced in English. No scene with only Japanese voices or no voices at all, you can enjoy hearing English. I don't mind Japanese voices, but the community was eagerly waiting for something like this.\n\nThirdly, the graphics. It's not meant to be realist, and it's better that way. Mainly because a Neptunia game drawn like The Last of Us or Uncharted 4 would look strange, but also because it keep with the anime environment. And you can really see it improved through the game, with amazingly drawn curves (Not those ones) and shapes, rendering a really pretty world with no angle where there should not be any.\n\nFourthly, the audio. Again, wonderful musics that fits well with the scenes, the environments and the characters. We can hear again some musics from the previous games, as well as a few new ones. And that opening is AMAZING.\n\nYeah, I know, I can't end it without speaking of the main selling point of the game, if you haven't heard about it you're probably going out too much, It's the best idea in the world : Ripping-off clothes when you get hurts too much. With a possibility to unlock unbreakable clothes, easily breakable ones and already ripped-off clothes. BEST. IDEA. EVER. I-it's not like that's what made me buy it or anything... Baka!\n\nJokes aside, I shall give that game an average score of 9.5/10\n\nGameplay :  9/10\nCharacters : 10/10\nGraphics : 9.5/10\nAudio : 10/10\nStory : 9/10\n\nIdea Factory International managed to fully gets the wishes of the fans and combine them in this game, even though it's a tiny bit short. At least they listen to the community, not like other companies *COUGH* *COUGH* Activision *COUGH* *COUGH*\nWell, that was weird...","May 12","true","26.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The controls were solid and responsive when I used a controller.  There's a lot of levels and two unlocked modes: a one-on-one fighting tournament and a multi-level tower with more stages to complete.\n\nThe Bad:  As most Neptunia games, you will need to do some grinding.  The levels are just thrown at you with no real structure as to what is next, making you have to look through them all to find which ones you should be doing.\n\nThe SaHD:  As a riff on the Senran Kagura games, your clothes can get ripped in this game.  While I appreciate that mechanic in SK, it comes off as creepy here.\n\n(I played many hours on the PS Vita version.  The game ran perfectly fine on my PC)\nMore in-depth reviews and more at: sahdgamer.com","May 13","true","1.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Those fans won't be disappointed. You can choose from the main CPU's and their candidates (poor candidate-less Vert) as they battle in a Dynasty Warriors-esque spin on the franchise.\n\nSpecial skills are unleashed via a pop-up menu accessed on a button press (controller recommended here), with your SP displayed as little blue pills in your status bar. Each pill represents 1000 SP, and each skill consumes a multiple of 1000 so it's a resource you'll run out of quicky. Fret not, however, as the enemies will often drop Hero Drinks which replenish your HP and restore some vital SP.\n\nYou can choose up to two characters per battle. One character will fight and the other recovering HP in the background, which you can switch at will. All characters have a transformation or 'HDD' mode true to the original games, which vastly increases your stats and even changes your skills in some cases. Use of this mode requires you to fill an 'EXE' guage which fills faster if your character is out of combat.\n\nGetting hit results in damage to whatever outfit you happen to be wearing. This means two separate sets of damage, both for your standard outfit and HDD modes. The exception to this are the two journalists, Dengekiko and Famitsu who use the same outfit for both modes as they don't have a 'true' HDD mode.\n\nDestroying your outfit means taking more damage overall, but heavier hits and more chances to fill the EXE bar, which means more opportunity for unleashing HDD mode. In addition, the EXE bar also grants you a super move which can empty an entire room and demolish boss monsters in mere moments. This can be used in HDD mode as well for a truly devastating attack, though it drains the EXE bar and you will revert back to normal afterwards.\n\nIn addition to the action, there is plenty of voice work the fan favourite VA's from franchise. For me, just listening to their banter is as entertaining as the action itself as they constantly break the 4th wall and make subtle and not-so subtle references to other video game franchises.\n\nIt's hard not to recommend the game. It knows exactly who it's target audience is and gives them what they want. Newcomers to the series might feel a bit lost and won't understand some of the references made (some refer to prior Hyperdimension games) but can enjoy it for what it is. A quirky action game with a healthy dose of humour to keep you entertained.","May 8","true","21.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tiltheend/recommended/387340/","Tiltheend","Scoot the Burbs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tiltheend/","77 products in account","Hyperdimension Neptunia U is an unusually low quality game for the series. If you hadn't already guessed, this game is a Dynasty Warriors-esque game where you need to mow down waves of enemies to win. But the game lacks even the most basic features anyone has come to expect from the Hack and Slash genre.\n\nThe main problem is that the game never tries to do anything more than that. DW and every variation at least has some variation on killing enemies - your objective is rarely just 'Kill 1000 dudes': they're far more often to the effect of capturing areas, defending teammates or killing key enemies to push the battle in your favor in sprawling maps where there's plenty to do. As it turns out being stuck in a claustrophobic space with no reason to do anything other than spam your light attack gets boring real fast.\n\nAnd that's quite the issue. The game never requires you to do anything other than spam one button. Even in the most basic of this genre, considering whether to use a single or multi-target move or expend a special bar is always present. But here, using anything but the patented 'spam x' strategy is horrendously inefficient. You might question the use of efficient in a context like this, but it will be at the forefront of your mind when playing this game. There is an ungodly amount of grinding. If you want to complete this game, you will need to grind. Each. And. Every. Character. There is no catch up mechanic. The only way to level those character you don't want to play but have to is to find yourself a nice long mission with lots of enemies and switch your brain off for a few hours.\n\nIn addition, the game seems to have a hard time conveying itself to the player. There are numerous points which are scarcely explained or expanded upon. Quite often I had found myself in a mission killing hundreds of enemies only to grind to a scrreching halt as only one enemy appeared on the map. In order to complete the mission I had to defeat the last 50 enemies one by one. These were also bosses so they took at least a minute to kill. This turned a five minute mission in a twenty minute mission that was painful to play. Even after searching all over the (very small) map for additional enemies, there was nothing. I refuse to believe the devs were genuinely incompetent enough to consider this sort of thing a mechanic, so I can only assume this was a glitch.\n\nFor some reason there is also no autosave. Maybe in the hopes you'll accidently erase your progress and waste more time?\n\nToo much of this game feels like cheap padding to push the playtime of the game upwards to justify its price tag. Unfortunately the core mechanics are far too barren to even consider it. Ultimately there is no reason to enjoy this game: the graphics are upscaled vita models, the soundtrack is tiny, the gameplay is incredibly boring with zero depth or interesting mechanics and the story is hardly interesting enough to justify the slog. If you're interested in a Hack and Slash, try Dynasty Warriors 8, Pirate Warriors 3 or Hyrule Warriors. All three are far more developed and interesting than this game.","May 14","false","17.4"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","2"

While it is a decent game, it's fairly shallow. There are only three specials available at any given time, plus an ultimate, and another three in a different character transformation. You can switch between two chosen characters, and I feel an opportunity was missed to have character switch combos. The lily-rank system might let you use dual specials, but I'm not far enough for that to matter. Combos themselves are pretty basic, nothing fancy and no combo creating, but that would be asking a bit too much.\nEnemies are sometimes too large in number, spawning constantly as the only type in numbers of around six, slowing down the action a lot. Doesn't happen often, but happens.\nStory is a Neptunia plot, works well, is generally fun and well voice acted.\nLooks pretty good, no port problems. Runs smooth.\nThere's even more fanservice than usual, but I really don't mind.\nThere are ten characters, and most of them feel pretty similar. Uni has a really interesting moveset, since she uses a gun instead of a melee weapon, but there's usually a spin, a slam, a stinger, and a launcher.\nDifficulty isn't that high. There are a few situations where you get destroyed pretty quickly, but it's not a problem if you know what you're doing.\nIf you've never played a muso, you've played them and you like them, you like Neptunia, or any combo thereof, pick it up.

Attacking groups of enemies feels more like your character is swinging at air, with foes just happening to die in front of you.

EDIT: Some peope can't get this game to run on their rig, be warned\n-If some of you gonna complain about IFI re-using game assets, heads-up, they are. But it's fine for me because it's a spinoff with Hack n' Slash, now go complain about something else.\n-Story... well, it is the same dimension as in Re;Birth 1, but the story is pretty much nonexistent for me, or that I just skip the dialogue too much.\n-Some people say the localization took liberty, be warned.\n-Still, decent jokes, which are Neptunia series charm.\n-Unless you're going for every achievements, the content is pretty short.\n-There's some NSFW stuff such as Custom Break, you might want to consider it if you play it with your family.\n-It's not on par with AAA Hack n' Slash title, but is not too bad either IMO, reason for this is bad enemy AI for most of the times, broken and underpowered moveset for some characters, and some more stuff, I guess worth the discounted price for now, but on full price you might want to reconsider it.\n-Obviously not for hardcore ones though, this one feels more casual, consider this if you need a break from DW or something similar\n\nOverall, a decent attempt at Hack n' Slash game, you might worth it more if you're fan of the franchise.","March 21","true","47.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Now, WASD to move and the IJKL setup to attack is reasonable, but the fact that the game is 3D, and the only convenient camera buttons are the numpad keys, makes this setup very uncomfortable. I also find it strange that while the right mouse button controls the camera, which is perfectly fine, the left mouse button does nothing except for interact in menus. It'd be nice to have it be used as an alternative input for a standard attack. That kind of control scheme would be more comfortable (And no, remapping doesn't work, as the game doesn't even respond when I try to).\n\nAgain, I can see the appeal in this game, but the controls are the only thing keeping me from enjoying it. If you primarily use a keyboard and mouse, I recommend holding off on buying until they add some additional control capability (even just making the primary mouse a useable attack button would make me change my mind)","March 25","false","0.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

So, if it seems like I'm giving this game too much (or, too little) credit due to not being familiar with the rest of the series, my apologies.\nNow, on paper, this game seems great. A hack-n-slash game based in the HDN universe? Even if it's simplistic, how could this go wrong? Unfortunately, there's a few minor things that make it a less-than-pleasant experience. Mind you, they can (and, I'm expecting, will) be patched, but... In the present, this feels like a less polished version of a Senran Kagura game.\n\n--\n\nEdit: So, it turns out that this was literally made by Tamsoft. That explains the odd feel of the game as well as the differences with the other HDN games.\nAnyway. I came here to drop a bit of an update, having played more of the game. Here's the thing. The loose camera is still a problem. The field of view is still annoying and lets enemies come up behind you, unseen. Still, if you can deal with those issues and you want a game that you can pick up for half an hour once in a while, play for a bit, and drop, it's pretty good, if a bit expensive. Otherwise, as I initially said, don't bother.\n\n--\n\nOn the bright side, the port seems solid. Now, I know that unlike the likes of Koei Tecmo, Idea Factory and Compile Heart are (in my experience) known for making quite solid ports, but I always feel the need to point this out. The game appears to be stable, has the full range of resolutions, has proper full screen AND borderless windowed mode, and even goes as far as full button remapping...the whole nine. No complaints there.\n\nUnfortunately, everything else, requires commentary.\n-First and foremost, the camera. It is both, quite loose and has a very narrow field of view. The former, may be fixed with a simple slider bar over the three options, as the jump between nearly immobile Slow and Average is massive. The latter....dear god, please let us zoom out. As close as the camera is to the back of the characters' heads, I can basically start counting their dandruff flakes.\n-The combat, while quite mash-y, it certainly works well enough. Its combo system is very basic and won't exactly have the complexity of Phantom Beaker: Battle Grounds' combat system. I'm not saying that's bad. Just keep that in mind, if you have the preference for something more complex.\n-The story....what happened? Did someone run out of ideas while having to meet a deadline? Or, is it a localization issue? I know that story isn't exactly the big selling point of a HDN game, but... In the Re;birth games, I still felt amused enough to see where everything was going and at what point they were going to subvert expectations. Here, half an hour in, my interest has already drifted off for greener pastures. If this improves as I play, I will edit this review, but...

The cast is the usual CPU characters, their sisters and two new journalists.\n\nUnfortunately, the gameplay is very stale and repetitive, boiling down to simply selecting a map and killing mobs until you win (there are some exceptions, with special condition maps, but they hardly refresh the game). The unlock system is a pure grind and is poorly presented -- once all unlocks for killing a particular enemy are done, there is no indication of this, meaning the player has to constantly check all the progress all the time. Further, while each individual character can be customized, generally there will be the same accessories that you would want equipped all the time, making it just cumberson to repeat the equipping process for all characters (not to mention having to do it again when a better equip is unlocked).\n\nAll in all, while the Neptunia style is generally there, it hardly does enough to warrant playing this game. There should be enough moe games out there to easily skip this one.","May 18","false","3.1"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

Given the amount of succesfull idea factory games on steam, you would think that they would put more effort into their ports. They choose go with the "bare minimum" route only because they can get away with it. They also will not support their games for longer than a few weeks. Much like how they abandonned Hyperdimension 2 mere weeks after release, the game still crashed on me constantly, but the devs said they were "Working on a fix". All this time later and not a single word from them and obviously I was unable to refund it because it had been so long.

Think Dynasty Warrior-style endless waves of enemies (its not really endless but for some missions it can feel like it) and crazy combos. Each character has familiar moves and SP skills with the addition of a team attack that they can perform if both characters have enough special meter. The story is pretty light so almost little to no knowledge of prior games is alright but you might miss out on little jokes here and there. The short levels make progress feel pretty good and the little in between scenes break up monotony with the usual 4th wall breaking humor. If you were looking for a game you can tackle at a leisurely pace this is your game.

I've even told the few people I know who were looking forward to it that they really shouldn't bother, considering how disappointed I was with it. The game's short enough to where, with the exception of one of the achievements, you can 100% the game in under ten hours. You can max out the level of all of your characters in less than that. I will admit that there were a few jobs that were tedious, and one or two could actually be labeled 'hard,' but the game is way too short, even considering the post-game 'dungeon,' which was longer than the story mode even if you only played it start to finish once. It also doesn't help much that the game's biggest gimmick, the ability to rip your character's clothes, doesn't really matter too much in this game unless you spam 'strong' attacks or use 'easy-rip' clothing, since the amount of damage you have to take to have your clothing torn is roughly 90% of your health, and if you take that much damage, you're pretty much dead - I've never once had an instance where my character's clothing was ripped and I SURVIVED the experience without using 'easy-rip' clothing.","May 31","false","43.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And beside all those "Nep-Nep is in" kind of useless review, I am going to give my two cents on this game.\n\nFirst, the disappointments.  It is similar to some Japanese-style hack-slash games such as Dynasty Warrior from Koei, among them Orochi Warrior Z is my all time favourite game.  Unfortunately this games pales too much in comparism to Koei's flagship series.\n1. The battle field (or dungeon) size, are you even serious? You have access to all the dungeons from Neptunia and you decide only to utilise like less than 1% of the area of each dungeon?\n2. The battle field, just too simple too plain.  In Warrior series you have friends cheering and enemies cursing you on battle field,  and there are tactics you should follow, be it diversion, infiltration or direct confrontation.  Sadly, in this game, you are all alone, there is nobody accompany you.\n3. The weapon system, the skill system, all absent.  The characters are just about levels, nothing more.\n\nAs I was thinking for a refund, I found this game is not all bad.  It is strangely addicting.  I would try to give a few reason for this,\n1. It is simple, yet not braindead.  As I thought this game is going to be too easy, I was killed serveral times during the 3rd mission.  Blindly go into the stack of monsters and mash buttons at your own peril.\n2. Again, it is simple.  No need to google or wikia for whatever hidden artefacts, or secret mission, or true ending.  No need to worry if you missed some sythesis materials. And, no need to grind.  If you feel tired or bored, play a few round of this game feels relaxing.\n3. Some design is very interesting.  There are missions (or dungeon) where the objective is hidden so you need to figure things out. There are also dungeons where monsters are strong but objective is simple, so the usual "kill-everything-that-moves" mentality for hack&slash games can get you into serious trouble.\n4. Character skills, attacks and HDD are well designed.  Many attacks of character also has certain property.  Such as Vert's weak attack ending is able to paralyse your foe.  It can be a game changer.  Uni's weak attack is ridiculously bad,  but in HDD, her attack do wonders. Nepgear's HDD weak attack is god like... There are just too much stuff to explore. So again, simple at the same time not brain dead.\n5. Actually I would like the main series to use this style instead of the battle followed by encoutering the monster.  It is much more engaging and faster-paced.  If not, I would like to see if they are willing to improve this spin-off and add more features, to make the game on par with the Wariror series,  then this game can be very good, even surpass the main series.\n\nSo, verdict?\nIf you're look for a good hack-slash game, run away from this game, the price tells you all.  As someone said, there are much better ones out there.\nIf you're a Neptunia fanboy like me, or like relaxing anime games in general,  this is quite a good pick, especially on sale.","June 6","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
