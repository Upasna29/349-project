There are 100 levels of the main story which will take you around 10hrs to complete. Every few levels a new element is added to the game which will change the way you play out the next few levels while some narrative/story telling goes on.\n\nFirstly, I want to talk about positives. The games option menu is good. It's perfect and what you should expect from a game like this. Different sliders for volume, AA, shadow settings, resolution and fs/windowed. All keys are remappable (for keyboard). I also really like the art style. It's really unique, colourful and visually appealing.\n\nUnfortunately, there are a lot of negatives for me. (Please remember this is my personal opinion so please keep that in mind and be respectful).\nOk first the voice acting. The voice acting of the robot (Alan) is well done. I believe it's the same voice that narrated TWA. But then your characters voice (Locksley/Rob) is a bit meh to be honest. As soon as he says a few lines it completely breaks the immersion of the game for me.\n\nSecondly, I would like to talk about the AI. The AI seem to suffer from a very serious case of short sightedness. Their entire view is about 2m in length and spews out in a cone shape. This means you can literally stand 2.1m in length away from them and bingo! They can't even see you! Or you can stand right by the side of them (clearly being in their peripheral vision) but they won't know any different! Ok, I really like the fact that if you do get in the view cone, the enemies begin to chase you down. A really nice element. This is where you can try to run away from them and avoid being in their sights for too long otherwise you fail the level. The AI on this is a bit so so. At one point a guard was right on my tail and I reached a dead end. So, I decided to go up against the only wall in the dead end room and yeap the AI couldn't for the life of him work out where I had gone! It's like I vanished!\n\nI'm also just going to add a little section here. It's a "Stealth game" but to be honest, it's pretty linear. Everything is kinda layed out for you and there only really seems to be one way of doing particular sections. For me, this is one of the most important aspects of a stealth game. Having the freedom to choose exactly how I progress through the level, but unfortunately that seems to be missing from this game.\n\nFinally, coming from the creator of TWA (which had an excellent story) I was a little disappointed with this. I couldn't seem to get to grips with the story of the game and the notes dotted throughout the levels didn’t really seem to add much to the story. The whole story felt a bit disjointed.\n\nWorth £15? Well, to be fair you get quite a lot of content for £15 so I think that is well justified. You also have online, and a level editor which is an excellent addition to this game. But for me, it doesn't quite do it. It needs more depth. I want the freedom to approach levels how I want to, play the way I want to.\n\n(Again, please bear in mind that this is my opinion, and all I ask is to be respectful towards it. Because hey, not everyone is going to like the same games) :)","August 18, 2015","false","7.8"," 515 of 657 people (78%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","78","515","657","18","15"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RubbishyUsername/recommended/365770/","RubbishyUsername","RubbishyUsername","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RubbishyUsername/","88 products in account","Volume combines an eclectic cast of voice actors with poor delivery and poor characterisation. Charlie McDonnell plays his character well, but the character is "twee British person who streams a video game", and those lines manage to be both cringeworthy and repetitive. The world-building is severly hampered by it's rigid adherence to a "retro" aesthetic, with all evidence of a future Britain controlled by a dictator being limited to 3 line paragraphs before each mission and the mission spaces themselves are completely utilitarian "house", "office" or "museum" spaces. There is no further variation in level style, but you wouldn't notice because those 3 spaces look almost identical anyway.\n\nThe stealth mechanics are expected to be innovative but instead boil down to "the noisemakers" that stealth games have employed for years and various flavours of invisibility/disguises. Unlike other stealth games though, those noisemakers are on an obnoxiously long cooldown which you must wait for after every death, adding another 15 seconds to the respawn time. In desperation, you may find yourself running at enemies, chrouching intermittently around non-descript blocks to temporarily break line of sight to avoid instant death before leaping at a checkpoint that will reset the guards' positions while moving yours further. This is the most fun the game gets, but the results are inconsistent and the fact that the developer has announced that he wants to remove this feature indicates that is not intentional. Volume also features much slower movement than other excellent action/stealth games available on Steam at the moment, which will leave you sitting on the edge of your seat not because the action is tense but because "Rob Locksley" refuses to stop crouching for any situation and move a little faster when he has a gun trained on him.\n\nThe Robin Hood imagery is not just unsubtle, it's spotlighted multiple times. In fact, the game has a habit of highlighting it's own flaws, with a cameo starring Jim Sterling being particularly galling as he completely demolishes the game's plot with his characteristic flourishes. The game awkwardly acknowledges this and then continues on, doing little to rectify its issues. There's been a lot of talk about the game's humour, and not the good kind. It makes jabs at today's streaming culture but doesn't follow it up with a message, and it briefly flirts with the meta-humour found in Thomas Was Alone, but that tragically fails when the game is no longer examining the nature of platformers, as in Thomas Was Alone, but instead turning inwards on it's own mistakes. These issues are compounded by the inclusion of 100 levels, as the talent has to be spread thin among endless identical corridors. I stopped playing at around 50% and the game had already outstayed it's welcome by about 2 hours. I knew it was around 50% because the game proudly tells you how far you've progressed. If the game was enjoyable, then it would feel like an unwelcome harbinger of when the experience will be over. The game is not enjoyable.\n\nIf you are looking for a stealth game featuring comedic elements, I would reccomend Gunpoint.\nIf you are looking for leaderboards in a stealth setting, I would reccomend Monaco.\nIf you are looking for a stealth game set in the near-future featuring mega-corporations, I would reccomend Invisible Inc.\nIf you are looking for meta-humour (humour about the game itself), I'd reccomend Bithell's own Thomas Was Alone.\nIf you are looking for geometric people shooting at you, I would reccomend the upcoming SUPERHOT.\nIf you are looking for British People, Charlie McDonnell vlogs on Youtube at charlieissocoollike.\n\nThe above games are all much cheaper than Bithell's offering and are all made by independent studios with smaller budgets than Volume's. Maybe one day we can get an update to Volume, offering faster movement for abilities be usuable immediately after spawning as well as lowering their cooldown and to balance that smarter AI that can't be ignored by briefly touching a wall. Then this game might be able to compete with some of the stealth antics offered above, even if other aspects pail in comparison. Maybe Bithell could call it Volume II.","August 19, 2015","false","4.2"," 128 of 177 people (72%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","72","128","177","8","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jygantic/recommended/365770/","jygantic","Jygantic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jygantic/","537 products in account","Volume is Metal Gear Solid burned down to it's very core, keeping it simple with classic stealth game tropes but not losing the fun in the process. I have been looking forward to playing Volume for a long time, as I am a big fan of it's creator Mike Bithell, who also created Thomas Was Alone.\n\nInstead of taking place in large areas with different rooms, Volume is set in multiple small levels. Each one has a different colour scheme and layout, so you don't have to worry about getting bored quickly. The game has a very minimalistic (cheap, hehe) design, similar to Thomas Was Alone, but in a 3D enviroment. All in all, Volume is a beautiful game. However, I must note that a lack of a death animation or even sound effect means that death has almost zero impact. The fact that all items aren't already loaded when you pick them up or respawn means that you sometimes also have to wait around for them to hurry up so you can use them.\n\nIt is also oozing with charm, with spot-on voice acting featuring not only multiple YouTubers such as Charlie McDonnell, Jim Sterling and Dan Bull, but also Andy Serkis, from Lord of the Rings and Planet of the Apes fame. The dialogue is brilliantly written, with humour often tucked in. There is also plenty of backstory to read while wondering through the levels, which adds a nice layer of mystery to the game's plot.\n\nFor the speedrunners out there, leaderboards for the time it takes to complete a level are placed to add a layer of challenge to the already rather difficult game. I wouldn't advise rushing through it though: take your time to marvel at the visuals, laugh at the dialogue and read through the creative backstorys.\n\nEverything about Volume reeks of Mike Bithell, from the design to the wonderful music, composed by Thomas Was Alone composer David Housden. If you liked Thomas Was Alone or the Metal Gear Solid series, you will adore Volume.\n\nEDIT: Unfortunately, some negative stuff, but just tiny nit-picks in the general scheme of things. You should be warned that I have found a rather glaring issue with the checkpoint system, which almost feels like cheating. It involves plassing through a checkpoint to save your progress while being chased by a guard. The guards sometimesalso don't do what they're supposed to do when using an item called the "gimmick", which is supposed to distract the guard by making them look at a certain place and note respond to sound. On numerous occassions, however, the guards have moved to where the sound came from, even though the visions cone stayed focus, and on others they have straight up ignored the gimmick when they hear a sound. The not-so-smooth transition between the standard stealth music track and the "seen" track is rather irritating after a while, and Charlie McDonnell's portrayal of the main protagonist can get a little I-don't-really-care-anymore. I wish I didn't have to say negative things about Volume, I really do.","August 18, 2015","true","2.9"," 68 of 90 people (76%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","76","68","90","4","0"

Most of all, I never felt challenged by this game, there's nothing demanding logic or wits. Only reflexes, memorization and trial and error. On the contrary, I see that someone can be into this type of gameplay. Just don't make a mistake assuming there is something puzzly about this game, how it's written in other reviews, just scroll to the top and read the tags: "action", "stealth" - very descriptive.\n\nStory is very flat and totally rudimentary, which is bad, because if it was good, I feel I actually would have been able to drag myself to the end.\n\n# Update\nAfter thinking about it a bit more I changed my view on this game. I came to realization that this is not really a stealth game at all. Indeed it has some mechanics, but I understood what kind of feel I got from this game. This is actually a pure platformer with some stealth mechanics duct taped to it. It sounds really strange, but stealth here really feels like a substitute to a jump button and guards are just pits you fall in. Creator's previous project was a platformer, and even his game in a completely different genre is still smells of platformer.\n\nOld part of review is still legit, but I removed recommendation for stealth fans.","March 24","false","6.2"," 31 of 39 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","31","39","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AGolfClub/recommended/365770/","AGolfClub","A Golf Club","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AGolfClub/","552 products in account","Well, I'm sure I'm not going to be able to do this game justice, but with sales rolling around and me continuing to enjoy it, I felt the need to strongly recommend Volume.\n\nFirst of all, it's got excellent gameplay that is expanded greatly due to the driven community content. Stealth elements contribute to some fantastic puzzles, both from Mike and also from the tons of talented geniuses that make full use of the level editor. The gameplay relies a lot on sound, using tools to distract enemies or get them to move, rather than taking them down. In case it isn't obvious, I'm a huge fan. It was quite the experience, finding the Bugle for the first time and having to use it in the refreshing situations that really utilize it. Of course, the game does get more complicated. One small complaint from me would be that eventually the tons of elements don't completely bring out the best in each other, and tend to get separated quite a bit in the level design. Again though, there are plenty of examples of that not being the case, if you play levels made by players. The level editor is available and relatively easy to use. I haven't had any breakthrough ideas yet,  but I did try it out at least :P\n\nIn case you didn't know, this game had a pretty big update - again responding to the community and feedback - maybe a week after it released. This expanded the checkpoint system to set up 3 "gamemodes" - differing at whether or not you could use checkpoints (and fixing the main complaints surrounding around being able to hit a checkpoint while running from a guard!)\n\nThe whole top down perspective thing is cool, a virtual simulation basis is brought to life by a distinct art style and surprisingly subtle storytelling. Volume is gorgeous to look at, listen to, and overall just take in. The voice actors did a phenomenal job, the soundtrack is sublime, and the premise really makes the most of artistic concepts along the way.\n\nNow, since this is Mike Bithell's next project after finishing Thomas Was Alone, obviously there will be comparisons drawn. But the thing is that Thomas's story was the drive of the gameplay in TWA. With Volume, things are much more game-y, meaning they are arguably a little less artsy in the process, but I don't see that as a bad thing. Volume's gameplay is what drives the plot. It's nothing exceptional, but it's exciting and fits the game perfectly. That's what I see as consistent between TWA and Volume, not that they are similar, but that they both have elements that fit well and balance out each other. Volume has an overarching tale, inspired by Robin Hood (how awesome is that?), of someone using simulators to inspire stealing. What I enjoyed was the uncertainty. There are tiny bits of backstory that are told gradually and form more of a setting than a plot line, meanwhile the main characters' actions are explored without straining the focus away from the fantastic gameplay. So for what it's worth, I still consider the story a huge positive. I'd almost argue that it's more impressive this way than Bithell's magnificent writing in his first game. Everything else in Volume is a step up, so I think a story that works with that well is a story worth praising.\n\nHope my 2 cents helps you decide if it's for you. The past few months really flew by for me, so when I noticed that there were 99 reviews I figured that Volume deserved me to bump that number up even if I couldn't do the best job explaining myself.\n\n* Stealthy puzzling gameplay with some great original mechanics\n* Refreshing light plot that is engaging and compliments the strong focus rather than overpowering it\n* Replayability, gamemodes, scoreboards, and more, to go along with the driven community\n* Growing game, feedback is considered and has helped make it better, as well as staff picked custom levels highlighted\n* Interesting characters\n* Well thought out art style, the OST is sublime, and between great VAs and writing, it's executed quite well\n\nTraditional rating: Bugle/10\n\nFinal verdict: This game is definitely for me. If it sounds like I'm just singing endless praises, it's because quite possibly every aspect of this game is in line with what I love and enjoy. My goal was to give you an idea of that, but closing I'd just like to point to that thumbs up symbol that stands for "recommended."\n\nBecause I really do recommend this game. It's well done and it stands out, I can see a wide variety of people enjoying it, and at the very least, you should give that a shot.","November 4, 2015","true","16.6"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","18","20","0","0"

I had envisioned some sort of top-down Mark of the Ninja type stealth game. Instead, Volume presents a progressively harder series of challenge maps. I've played for an hour and all the ones I've seen are quite small, as in they can be beaten on your first run through in anywhere from 10 to 90 seconds. There is a story but it's kind of meh and involves a lot of side reading.\n\nMy main disappointment is the focus isn't so much on finishing the levels as it is doing it as quickly as possible to try and compete on the leaderboards. If you're like me and don't care so much about leaderboards, you will blow through a lot of levels and they won't leave much of an impression on you. So far each level I played was pretty easy as long as I took my time. The only difficulty stems from trying to rush through a map.\n\nHowever, I like the graphics, the spoken dialogue, the music, the virtual atmosphere, and the gameplay & controls were designed well (if you're using a gamepad, at least; haven't tried with keyboard controls). They also have a level editor and allow people to post online challege maps.

Kind of reminds me of the Metal Gear Solid VR missions. I played through the first 40 levels before I realized how much time I spent at it.\n\nA few notes:\n- The game takes critical thinking and tactics to escape/evade the guards. If you have them already it mostly comes down to timing. If you don't you will get the chance to work on them provided you work through the frustration. I have a pretty good ability at looking at a path puzzle and figuring my way through it without really thinking. Useless gift, but it is one of only a few talents I have. :D\n- That said, you will often really need to think outside the box. Find a spot where you can use a distraction long enough to run behind a guard or through its line of sight to evade/escape. Some of the early levels escaping isn't always viable, but later on when the levels with twists, turns, and obstacles, it is.\n- Decent voice acting, and I am actually intertested in the story progression. Speaking of which, if you start a new level, or perform an action which splits some narration it will start the audio conversation over. Generally it seems to be at a decent point, not rehashing several sentences back.\n- Controls, both keyboard and controller work well.\n- UI and graphics are pretty smooth; no graphical issues so far.\n- I have not come across any bugs either.\n- I can't seem to find a way to see your personal best time on a mission without entering the mission. Maybe it is there, but if it isn't it definitely should be.\n\nI got this a while ago and wish I would have played it sooner!

There are definitely some neat ideas floating about (running a stream LP on how to steal from locations is rather novel, and it's a pretty gorgeous game), but the checkpointing encourages you to finish levels in a clumsy fashion instead of properly sneaking, and even when you DO play it "properly," the abysmal guard AI and sluggish movement combine to make it a miserable time. Even the story falls flat: the person who voices Locksley isn't great, especially next to Andy Serkis, the plot is delivered haphazardly, and just when it starts to get promising, it ends.\n\nI was really looking forward to this one, but it falters in nearly every regard.

Everything has a cool almost Tron-esque glow to it all. The game does its best to inject story and personality into all its scenes, this is also supported by the excellent voice acting and amazing soundtrack. Story tidbits aside the gameplay is pretty straight forward, gather gems, avoid guards, and exit the level. The controls are rather simple as well, and to be honest the entire game is simple in design. This isn't a bad thing but the game does end up feeling like it lacks something. Other problems crop up like silly AI. The robot guards seem to only chase you 4 feet and then give up, on top of that is the checkpoint skipping that allows you to simply by pass some obstacles. Despite these hiccups, Volume is a entertaining stealth based game, it has over 100 levels and more with the built in map editor. Giving players the chance to let the mechanics of the game shine. The game does a good job of escalating the difficulty and changing the level design. Even if things start feeling slightly repetitive. I still had a good time with the game and there isn't many games completely based on stealth out there.

If you're lazy and want to know if it's good that's down at the bottom, somewhere. (Yes, it's good.) (it's  at the bottom too)\n\nIn this game you start simply enough with a few things you can do such as crouch against walls and walk around and explore. Then there is information that is gathered which sheds some light on the world, and provides a nice way to introduce backstory without a ton of exposition that people will hit escape on. The world is there, the world is substantial. I was invested in this world, not because I've lived it, but due to the excellent writing and narrative it provided.\n\nThe writing was humourous, light-hearted and entertaining where it was needed and serious enough to drive this story of corruption and power.\n\nAfter the first few missions you start obtaining items that can be picked up and used, but only one at a time so plan accordingly. These vary through each map, so you're never feeling completely comfortable or stuck with an  item.\n\nWhen I sat down with this game, I told myself that I would play it for a couple hours and then I would do a work in progress review. Four hours later I hit the halfway mark, and I kept going. Seventy-five percent I said, and I'll do my review. Which brings us to now, Eight hours after I first clicked play. The game is complete, for now.\n\nI am sad, only because I can't experience this again for the first time. But at the same time, I'm so excited, because now I have to look forward to the community levels making my own, going back through and beating my own time as well as fighting for a place on the leaderboards.\n\nThe soundtrack was hauntingly well done, filling every crevice in the game with a sense of wonder, and dread that that one frickin AI was going to just turn around and spot me and put an end to my shenanigans. Said shenanigans include throwing whistles through the air, turning invisible, dodging electric traps and lasers. It's like I'm a young James Bond, if only his bestie was a robot AI that kind of enjoyed sarcasm.\n\nWhen I first set out in the game I had issues with it. I didn't like the voice actor for the main character, he sounded bored. But, as the game went on he grew on me. He wasn't bored, he was just alive, reacting normally how someone might react. There was no need for overhyped dialogue. It fit perfectly.\n\nSometimes the AI seemed a bit random in it's movements. Where one time I would do something and it would work and then die/get caught before the next checkpoint and do the exact same thing and it would fail. But, with patience I was able to get through those parts by finding a new creative way to push on through.\n\nSometimes the controls don't respond normally, and sometimes when you're in stealth or cover the AI enemies will bump into you and push you out and you get spotted.\n\nTwo of the bigger complaints I have is that sometimes the color choices for the level make it very hard to see where the AI is looking when patrolling, but that was rare, and that the enemies can walk through each other, but they're a brick wall to you.\n\nDo those things take away from the game? Not one damn bit.\nThis will be sitting on "my shelf" of games that I talk about for a long time. Up there with The Metal Gear Solid series and Gunpoint.\n\nIf it's not obvious and you find yourself asking "should I buy this game?"\n\nThe answer is a resounding 'Yes', Mike Bithell as managed to take a game genre that was lacking and gave it exactly what it needed.\n\nA voice.","August 19, 2015","true","9.2"," 25 of 37 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","25","37","0","1"

Most of the times you are given a tool such as a distraction device or full out invisibility to help you along the way. There are 100 such rooms or levels that the developer included although the included level editor and community browser with weekly level staff picks provide a relatively healthy supply of fresh and exciting new rooms. It's fun but It feels very shallow in its entirety. The biggest flaw in the title is the linear design of the levels. Because you are given carefully picked tools to aid you in each level, the gameplay starts feeling like a puzzle solver. This inevitably severely limits your choices on how you would like to approach certain situations therefor making the levels lack in depth. Luckily it is innovative and unique enough to keep one interested.\n\nLength wise It took me a little over seven hours to beat it in its entirety (100% achievements) but again, if you get hooked, user levels are always available. It's one of those games that I feel everyone would enjoy but its questionable how much you could take before you would feel bored. It's a bit of a hard recommendation looking at its steep price point but an excellent approach to visual level design, innovative gameplay and unique writing thematic makes me think its justified. If you like what you see, I've no doubt you will love it.","February 12","true","7.2"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

It's a very endearing game that gives you exactly what it said it would. Yes, the concept is simple. Yes, the enemies ignore you when they should be able to see you, but it's the way the game was designed. It is a puzzle game with a focus on stealth and misdirection to enact acts of theft and espionage.\n\nOnce ou realize the story that is going on you find that the graphics, the 'logic', and pretty much all of it make sense. It've very cohesive even from aesthetic right down to the characters. The interactions with Alan and Locksley are priceless.. and Gisborne is delightful. No really he is. Humour is spot on.\n\nThe story and backstory unfold nicely as you move through the game. Sure, the official gameplay might be a bit short, taking a few hours to get through the first half of the game.. there's 100 level by the way... but the game's replay value is utterly extended by one simple feature.. level creation tools. The tools provided look to be practically what the developer would use himself. They are a bit clunky, especially if you are not a level editor like me, but they provide you with pretty much whatever you'd want.\n\nThese levels are also made available for other players to test their might, and the devs will pick from among the best for Staff Picks.\n\nAll in all.. this game is amazingly wonderful. It can be frustrating.. it can be super easy.. it can even get a bit repetitive at times, but not once have I not had fun while doing it.\n\nOnly complaint.. the Locksley/Alan banter is only for the first time through a level until you complete said level. So sad. Love those parts. They are the best.","August 21, 2015","true","8.1"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","12","18","2","0"

It's elegant and simple design is this game's strong point but people looking for a more in depth experience may find the game lacking.\n\nVolume's simplistic approach in both it's striking viuals and it's gameplay are what make the experience so worthwhile. The brilliant level design of the core 100 levels accentuate the solid gameplay and drip feed new abilities and mechanics as the game goes on, rarely leaving the player without some new concept to wrap their head around, although interest can wane over longer play sessions: I'd suggest take your time to enjoy the game in multiple play sessions.\n\nFurther more, Volume has a built in community level editor. You can create and share your own levels with the world, effectively giving the game endless replayability.\n\nThe cherry on the cake is an interesting Robin Hood story in a future dystopian England, even if it is prehaps not center piece to the experience.\n\nFor these reasons, the closest comparison to another game I'd have is to Little Big Planet: simple, charming, effective and (post end-game), community driven.\nRecommended to anyone who is interested in a barebones yet elegant stealth game.","September 7, 2015","true","15.3"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

A simple yes or no is not an adequate system. Also you should force people to say why they're downvoting something, hinder the negativity. There's far too much of it already. Now...\n\nI hate to say it because I really enjoyed Thomas Was Alone and there was a lot about this I liked but it is, unfortunately, a bit ♥♥♥♥. As I'm sure you know the gameplay is little more than the VR missions from the OG Metal Gear Solid. There are some cool little ideas here and there but it just doesn't carry a whole game. The story seemed interesting but it's just spread out over too many levels, I got past 50% but seeing how long it took for that percentage to go up just made amount of levels seem daunting. I'd be a lot more inclined to play it after I'd finished it for sheer joy than I am with "Incentive". It's just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off. Also the story narrative is so immediate that it feels like I can't play something else and come back to it without forgetting what's going on, diminishing the impact of the story and so, I'm just getting bored with the repetitiveness.\n\nWith the introduction of motion sensor lazer cunty thingiema♥♥♥♥ers it just got infuriating after a while. It forces you to take so much more time and with par times the idea of not hitting it just feels wrong. I'm so sick of games that rate how you play, I play games to escape the fact that I'm a ♥♥♥♥ing loser with no real world skills, I don't need these ♥♥♥♥♥ reminding of that. For the love of god, just let me pretend to be awesome for one measly hour of the ♥♥♥♥ing day!\n\nNow for a bit of the ol' positivity; the music isn't bad but it hardly feels there until you get spotted and then it really wants it's presence to be known. It just isn't as good as Thomas Was Alones OST but that is a rather high bar so it's easily forgivable. Also not very positive but whatever.\n\nThe voice acting is pretty good, very similar in tone to Thomas and even features Danny Wallace again as well as Andy Serkis and a few YoutTubers. And the controls are fine, it does feel a bit limited without the ability to crawl and ♥♥♥♥, like in MGS though. That bugged me.\n\nIn short, it ain't bad but it ain't great neither. Perhaps I'm too impatient for this kinda thing these days. I'm still gonna say you should buy it, if only to support Mike Bithell. I have faith in him. He represents all that should be within the game development world.\n\n\nP.S. I've played offline quite a bit so my play time is not indicative of anything.\n\nEdit: I've just listened to the actual soundtrack and it is brilliant, it just seems to be used in a more subtle way in the game.","March 17","true","1.4"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","65","11","17","4","0"

GangstaK here.\nThis Volume game has to be one of my favorite games of all time.\nWhy?\nVolume is the first strategic stealth game I've ever enjoyed for both the gameplay and the story.\nEspecially the story.\nI'm not gonna spoil it, but the story really is quite fantastic, and the gameplay is really cool as well. It seems to me the best way to describe the gameplay is relating XCOM: Enemy Unknown and Thief in one super cool futuristic game.\nThe graphics are insane, because I certainly love games that don't try to look realistic. This just keeps a smooth, 100% abstract simulated design that I can't enjoy more.\nIt bears down on the basics and focuses of what you need to see, such as enemies, all while having a comfortable backstory to really tie a bow on top.\nHonestly, at first, I felt the same as you, not so sure if the $5 sale was worth selling some of my extra CS:GO skins to pay for it, but I can personally promise that you won't regret getting this game. Even if you don't appreciate stealth games, this challenges your mind and sucks you into a gaming world that I never ever want to leave.\nIt's the perfect game for me, anyways!\n9.6/10 wood r8 again.\nAnd if you wouldn't mind, check out my profile for some extra reviews.

Just one that's a little more rough around the edges this time...\n\nThe gameplay has both quality and quantity, with it being fun, addictive and challenging but also with thousands of user-designed levels ontop of the 100 story-based ones. It feels more like a puzzle game than a stealth game where instead of thinking "How am I going to get to the end without anyone seeing me?" you're more likely to be in the mindset of "What tricks am I going to have to use to get through this segment while collecting all jewels?". This is mainly due the massive variety in gadgets and the general robotic nature of the AI as none of it feels natural or at all realistic. Course, this is a video game so none of that matters...\n\nHowever, this means that the gameplay and the story do not fit together perfectly as the story banks on you seeing the gameplay as hyper-realistic. However, moving past this, the story is incredible. It takes the already classic tale of Robin Hood and runs with it before completely turning it on it's head. It knows when to be quite, dramatic and hilarious with fantastic performances from Charlie McDonnell, Danny Wallace, Andy Serkis and a few other brilliant performances that I promise not to spoil ;)\n\nThe soundtrack is perfect, from something quiet and atmostpheric to incredibly loud and epic. I could listen to it for days and I probably will. This is where the game definitely surpasses Thomas Was Alone, Bithell's previous game.\n\nAll in all, it's a 9/10 as opposed to Thomas Was Alone's 10/10. It is a different game (though does have a fair amount of nods and winks, don't you worry) and the studio is obviously moving on to new things but the fact that story and gameplay didn't fit each other kept it from surpassing it's predecessor.\n\nTLDR: It's not Metal Gear Solid in terms of stealth meets story but it captures all the british charm, humor and charisma that you need for a fantastic video game.","December 24, 2015","true","12.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dotdashington/recommended/365770/","dotdashington","DotDashington","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dotdashington/","175 products in account","Review for Volume from Bithell Games\n__________________________\n\nQuick Overview:\n\nVisuals: Sharp, but minimalistic. It is cleverly done, creating solid aesthetic. The vibration animations are very neat. I love how sound interacts with the environment.\n\nSound: Also strong. The soundtrack is spot on, with great music for sneaking around corners, and incredibly jarring "YOU DONE GOOFED" music that makes me jump everytime. Sound effects are also nicely done, especially in how they tie in with the rest of the game. The voice acting varies from strong to excellent. Serkis does a tremendous job, and the Jim Sterling cameo is delightful. Some of Loxley's quips seem oddly dissonant with his demeanor during the main conversations he has. Alan is spot on.\n\nStory: The world is steeped in fascinating lore. It is a shame that I only got to see ghosts of it. The story is drop fed to you occasionally, on certain levels. This creates pacing issues, with large stretches of levels without a story pulling you along. Very interesting, but the pacing complicates matters.\n\nGameplay: Arguably the game's strongest attribute. It nails stealth by keeping things straight forward and simple. It layers on logical complexity as time goes on, always abiding by its own rules, which are very clear. This makes any mistake your fault. As it is a stealth game, this is a big bonus. It also makes me want to swear very loudly. Stealth is not a genre I find particularly engaging, but this game's solid framework, and fairness made it far more engaging.\n\nIn Depth Discussion:\n\nVolume is the sort of game that perplexes me. Story is often what draws me into a game, with a good tale making me very willing to overlook a lot of janky gameplay. Volume gives me the opposite problem. The story isn't bad, just not delivered efficiently. The way it gets interrupted by gameplay, often making the story feel like the sideshow, is a little jarring. As great as the voice acting is, it just kind of gets in the way of what makes the game great, its super solid stealth mechanics.\nWhich is really a shame. This is not to say that I think there shouldn't be a story, quite the opposite. The story is practically absent for huge stretches of the game, letting it slip from the mind. Then when it comes back, it is a little jarring. If it were more consistently present, even in the form of short conversations at the beginning of each level, It would likely feel more even. I would love for Loxley to actually talk to some of the stream watchers, because it is the world around Loxley that is more interesting. Loxley is causing waves in the world around him, but all we get is the occasional message from Alan letting us know that it is happening. As much as I appreciate having things left to the imagination, I feel that this is a sorely missed opportunity. Also, these near blank slates of people that we are helping get robbed could really have used some development, as characters. The world is so interesting, I really wish that it interacted with Loxley more, rather than us essentially putting on a play and hoping that the viewers catch the moral and run with it.\nHowever, I still maintain that Volume is a good game, with "game" being more operative in the literal sense. There are clearly defined rules, with clearly defined implementations, with clearly defined goals. It is so prestinely smooth that I want to punch whoever designed those lasers. Because I hate them. And every error is my fault, not the games. I broke its rules, I got the consequences. But, screw those lasers. Volume's gameplay is so cleverly streamlined that there are few faults I can find in it. The only one that really jumps out at me is the cooldowns on your powers after you respawn. Loxley has tools that he can use, but each has a cooldown. When Loxley gets murderated, he respawns with his tool on cooldown, meaning you have to wait a bit before you can get going again. Which isn't a huge issue all of the time, but there are sections where you will die frequently, with that time stacking into annoyance. Not a huge issue, but a qualm that will likely irritate some more than others. Other than that, the gameplay tricked me into enjoying a stealth game, which is one heck of a con. It has a very "one more level" vibe going on. I happily worked my way through the game, having a blast, often getting blasted by guards (screw lasers).\nFor those looking for a mechanically masterful stealth experience, look no further. For those looking for a mechanically masterful stealth experience with a masterfully told story, I have some major caveats. The story is interesting, but its method of deliverly is poorly executed. It is as if someone is drip feeding me chocolate mousse with an eye dropper. It is still delicious, but it takes forever to get there, making it far less enjoyable. As I mentioned at the beginning, I am used to letting mechanically flimsy games get off nicely if their story whisps me away. Volume has convinced me that the opposite is also true, with its truly engaging gameplay willing to deal with its famine level rationing of story nibblets. Also, the team seems very intent to continue supporting the game regularly, so some of my qualms (likely not the story ones) may get addressed. I would like to thank the people at Bithell Games for putting all their wonderful effort into this game, rage inducing lasers or not (screw lasers).\n\n","August 22, 2015","true","8.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

It's not terrible. It just feels kind of slight. The game takes a long while to really get to interesting puzzles, I want to say at around the 25 percent mark at earliest, and even those aren't much to write home about. From about 50 percent on it's a fairly good game overall, but it feels less like a stealth game and more like a puzzle game. You've only ever got one gadget at a time and there's only I want to say 5 levels where there's actual choice in gadgets so solving most puzzles tends to be pretty linear. That's not to say there's no creativity. The game has checkpoints and "shadow" systems are blatantly exploitable and instead of ignoring that actually has some fairly cool puzzles designed around knowing players will cheese those sort of mechanics.\n\nThere's a story but it's pretty bare bones. It's Robin Hood in VR. There are only a few characters, including a villain voiced by Andy Serkis, but for the most part there's not a ton of story. The narrator from Thomas was Alone returns to voice an AI, and some youtuber voices the lead character and is kind of terrible. It flits in and out, and it ends on kind of an anticlimax.\n\nThere's a level editor and you can easily share levels and download others.

The people of England can then copy his moves and take back what they deserve by themselves.\n\nGameplay wise, it is a stealth game. Well to be precise, its a semi-minimalistic isometric hardcore non-lethal stealth game. The gameplay includes sneaking around (obviously), along with using all kinds of gadgets to distract guards and get from point A to B. Because Locksley does not intend to kill/maim guards, he did not bring any weapons. He cannot fight. if this is a problem for you, you will not enjoy this game. The objective is to collect all the gems (which represent valuables) in a level, and then continue to the exit. There are also walls that can be jumped over, closets/floorboards that can be hidden in/under, taps & toilets that can be activated, etc.\n\nI really enjoyed each level, but they can feel slightly repetitive. Take breaks in between whille playing this. Playing it in one sitting is not advised.\n\nThe guards' AI is not perfect, and as a result, it is fairly easy to make them lose sight of you (provided there are lots of corners in your immediate vacinity). There are also a few minor bugs that still need to be ironed out (nothing gamebreaking though).\n\nThe voice acting and music are very well done. The music fits well with the game, and is frankly quite beautiful. The voice of the main antagonist (voiced by Andy Serkis) sounds really good too.\n\n\nAll in all, i personally really enjoy Volume, and i think Mike Bithell has definitely proven that he is not a 'one hit wonder'. The game is not perfect, but if you are a fan of hardcore stealth games, you will definitely enjoy this!\n\n(I don't particularly enjoy giving games a score, but if i had to, it would be an 8/10)","August 30, 2015","true","9.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I hope for a sequel!\n\nOverall I rate this game 9/10, because for all the things it did well, it had a few flaws with the knights being able to hit you through walls or hit you when they are stunned because the stunning took effect just as the killing animation did, in addition to a few achievements only unlocking when you restart the game.","December 25, 2015","true","8.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This isn’t a tightly told story like Thomas Was Alone. It’s more of a stealth arcade game, in the vein of the Metal Gear Solid VR missions.\n\nCompared to Metal Gear Solid, Volume is simplified. You can’t crawl or hide in narrow spaces, there are no melee attacks, and your inventory is reset between levels. In any situation there’s usually only one way to progress, in a way that feels rigid. Because of your limited abilities, the challenges never feel particularly interesting. The solutions are immediately obvious, and it’s just a matter of brute force trial and error to get past. AI and checkpoints are easily exploitable in a way that feels like a deliberate design choice, as a workaround for you not having anything to do if you’re discovered. All this leads to levels feeling disposable. Once you’ve finished them once, there’s not much more you can do with them. It’s only slightly more complex than Thomas Was Alone in that sense. Compared to something like Thief, it’s more Trackmania than Gran Turismo. Every level is a one-off, instead of something you’ll be coming back to over and over to explore alternative solutions. I came in expecting this, so I was fine with it. But if you’re a hardcore stealth fan it might not be enough. Like Trackmania, Volume has a level editor, and there are already tons of new maps out there. I haven’t looked at them, but it wouldn’t surprise me if the game comes alive through them in a way that the campaign mode doesn’t.\n\nThe story was the greatest disappointment for me, mostly because of how underwritten it feels. There’s 100 levels in the campaign, and you go several levels at a time without seeing the ghost of the story. Levels are purportedly based on machines you’re hacking, where the dirty laundry of corrupt government officials and heads of corporations are shown to the world. But during levels this isn’t evident at all. I was hoping for something like Tron 2.0, where the visual design of the levels reflected the kinds of systems you were inside, with emails exposing the internal workings of the system. But Volume isn’t like that. This isn’t a grand story arc that unfolds over the 100 levels. Instead it’s a story for a game 1/5 this size, with the majority of the levels being there because it’d be poor value for money if it was any smaller. You do read emails and documents, but they seem to have no connection whatsoever to what’s going on. This is a complete waste, because this story needed more. It has loads of characters, but with most only existing as portraits in the main menu.\n\nThe music does a better job of capturing the theme of the story than the writing. Much like the Ys games, it felt at times like I was playing it more to enjoy the music than anything else, with the story only becoming more nonsensical the further I got into it. Most character development happens off screen, and the stakes are so poorly telegraphed I had no idea what was going on when the end came. At one point the connection between the game and story breaks down completely, making it clear no effort was made to make the parts gel. It’s inelegant, and because of how thin it is, Volume ends up being both blunt and vague.\n\nSo the story is disappointing. But if you approach it with this in mind, that it’s primarily about stealth puzzle challenges, then it’s still reasonably fun. Thanks to the music it felt like a nice place to be. With every level taking 2-5 minutes to finish, it was easy to just keep playing, even if the next map probably wouldn’t add anything to the story. It’s not bad, but I am disappointed.","August 25, 2015","true","4.9"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

The dialogue also restarts if you read any of the story points or tutorials which is incredibally annoying.

Those of you who love stealth with tools to distract and counter guards (no killing) then this is the game for you.\n\nIt is a really interesting game to play, where even in the later stages of the 100 core levels you are introduced to new techniques which can be combined with others to make you a master of stealth and distraction. The game is a modern twist on the classic tale of Robin Hood with a heavy influence of the VR training missions from the older Metal Gear Solid games. Visually it is quite astounding to see. Most of the games design is based around the shape of a tittle (diamond shape with sharp edges).

Some people dislike it, others like it. I for one enjoy hearing the dialogue to help draw me into the world created by the visuals, gameplay and ambient sounds.

I've followed the development of the game since Mike announced it and I am purely astounded by just how well the game has turned out to be.\n\nFor those of you who enjoy a stealth game that gets progressively harder (as well as making your own level of hardness) then I would highly recommend this game to you.","August 20, 2015","true","13.9"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","10","20","0","0"

Consider this a first glance review.\n\nGreatly inspired by Metal Gear Solid and Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, especially the accompanying VR missions for those games, the game takes the best from its influence and simplifies it in a fun, challenging and pick-up-and-play way. Simplification here is not bad, at all, nor does it imply a lack of content or depth in the game. It is from actual appreciation of its inspiration that the game manages to deliver some good stealth puzzle action. I have always wanted an expansion to the MGS’s VR missions, and Volume fulfills that gap.\n\nThis isn’t to say that Volume is just a direct replica. It has its own feel, own way of playing and its own experience. But it can’t be overlooked that it serves to revitalize a stealth genre that is honestly not looked into more. First, “Not the Robots”, and now “Volume” are bringing back stealth puzzle games, and I love it.\n\nFrom my short play of the game, the controls feel responsive and intuitive. I did come across some weird audio glitches where characters say lines out of nowhere, without context, that they have said before. I’m not sure if this is intentional or a glitch that can later be fixed, but it did distract me a few times.\n\nVisuals are great, again, the MGS VR inspiration is very apparent, but the “volumetric” approach to how the maps look is striking, To put it simply, I really like it.\n\nI would say, play this game. It’s really fun so far, and I have a feeling ii will be the more I play.

The graphics are clerar and really fit the situation, with nothing looking muddy or cluttered. The voice acting is brilliant, I would expect nothing less from the creator of Thomas Was Alone. The missions look as though they are similar in style to Metal Gear Solid stealth sections. the story unfolds slowly but after about ten levels you really have a feel of the backstory to the game. It seems as though story, with regards to what is happening to our character, comes every 5 or so levels to begin with. The back story is revealed through text in the game, emails, news papers and a blurb at the start of each level.\n\nThe aim of this game is to be stealthy and to collect gems to open the end of the level. As the game progresses there are further complications to the gameplay but nothing that feels out of place. You can place shiny things to grab the enemies attention , flush toilets and use your bugle. All that time in the sea cadets wont be wasted.\n\nThe soundtrack is amazing I recommend that to everyone, I haven't been able to stop listening to it since I got the game.\n\nThe story progresses nicely and reveals slowly to begin with.\n\nHighly recommended.

I know I did. The levels are short, well designed and not too taxing, so I was never stuck on the same problem for too long. New mechanics and enemies are introduced at regular intervals to keep things interesting, and I enjoyed figuring out new ways of fooling the guards. The graphics are simple, but clean and reasonably stylish, and serve the concept well. The controls work well (I played with a gamepad), and though I did encounter a few bugs, none of them were game-breaking or detracted from the experience in a major way.\n\nGameplay-wise, the biggest problems are by design: A checkpoint/restore system that resets your enemies' positions but not your own accomplishments is easily exploited, and some challenges can be overcome by simply running through them and hiding afterwards. It felt like I blundered through them instead of solving them, and the game didn't punish me for it or give me compelling enough reason to go back and try to solve them properly.\n\nThe story and setting are OK, pretty standard "rising up against the totalitarian regime" fare, but since the playfield is so abstracted, it felt like I was being served the story in parallel to the gameplay rather than actually playing it out, and this left me feeling a little detached and not fully invested in it.\n\nThere were some sound issues. While the sounds of the guards and the environment were good, the character voiceovers lacked cohesion in terms of recording space and audio quality, enough so that it became a real issue for me. One character in particular sounded like it was recorded in a vat of wool, which may or may not have been intentional, but it threw me off regardless. A few dialog bugs were present as well, such as some levels playing a random line instead of their opening dialog, but I'm sure these will be dealt with promptly.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed my time in the Volume. 6-8 hours is a good length for this type of game, and though plenty of games offer more content for the same price, it still feels like decent value, especially considering the tons of user-created levels that are forthcoming thanks to the included level editor. I liked Mike's first game, I liked this one, and I'm excited to see what he comes up with in the future.","August 19, 2015","true","8.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I bring this up because Volume is very, very much somthing to be proud of.\n\nFirstly, the game is beautiful. the textures are not terribly detailed, but they are done so in a stylistic manner. The game has terrific visual effects, the most notable being the "exploding triangle thing".\n\nStory wise, Volume carries one of the most mind blowing things for me in recent history. While this may have been a result of myself going into Volume with certain expectations, I do not want to spoil it for those who have done the same. All I will say on the matter is: "Ryan 192nc9s"\n\nGameplay wise, Volume follows the ideal indie game approach, as Mr. Bithell is prone to do, that being "do one thing, but do it very very well." The whole game is of the 'soft stealth' variety, in which being seen is not always a death sentence, but only if you get seen intentionally. While unfortunately, many of the gadgets are just variations on the same noisemaker, this game does promote their small differences strongly, as you cannot kill in this game. all of the gadgets are there to distract your foes, not remove them from action. You must therefore apply the small differences in the gadgets in incresingly clever ways if you want to make par time, or even complete the level in the first place.\n\nIn conclusion, Volume is a very good game made by a very good team. I bought Volume on Mr. Bithell's reputation alone, and I am glad that I did so. The levels often force you to think outside the box, and all together this game is so addicting that I had to forcefully rip myself off of the next level button just to write this review.\n\nOh, and did I mention that the soundtrack is made (once again) by David Housden? The soundtrack alone is worth 20 bucks.\n","August 21, 2015","true","4.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

My first impression video is linked below.\n\nIf you're a fan of pure stealth then I'd definitely recommend having a look at Volume. It strips stealth gameplay down to its most basic elements. Think stealth-puzzle rather than stealth-action, as each level is a challenge to be figured out, and there's no way for you to murder or KO guards.\n\nIt's quite easy to pick and play too. The minimalistic design does a lot to welcome you in, the Metal Gear Solid style aesthetic suits the game quite well, and it has that "just one more mission" type of addictiveness going for it so far.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8RJYPtO0no","August 19, 2015","true","0.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gaffit/recommended/365770/","gaffit","Gaffit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gaffit/","191 products in account","I'll admit that I bought this game solely because I am such a huge fan of Thomas Was Alone. I mean, I don't even like stealth sections in games, let alone entire games about stealth.\n\nHowever, what I found was that although I don't like stealth games, I love puzzle games, which is what I found this game to be. The gameplay is simply phenomenal, and the stealth puzzles are all extremely intuitive. I found that I could easily solve most puzzles on my first try about halfway through the game because I started getting into the game's rythm of which way guards are most likely to turn and the best way to use items to get guards to look the other way for long enough to get the thing.\n\nWhen it did turn into a stealth game, I got my ♥♥♥ kicked. I'm looking at you lasers.\n\nThe plot was very good, and it's the type of game where you have to piece together a lot of information from the clues the game gives you to get a greater understanding of the world. And I was so very pleased near the beginning to discover that this universe is the same one that Thomas Was Alone takes place in.\n\nI did some trouble with the menu though. Going in for the first time I found the opening menu a bit un-intuitive. It didn't seem to like the Xbox controller I was using, and some of the menus were clearly meant to only be used with a mouse. The first instance that springs to mind is when scrolling through the list of the 100 main-story missions. This takes 5 seconds with a mouse, 5 minutes pressing down on the controller. Also when you unlock character customization, it's impossible to select a color with the controller (Bright Green Ninja Thief of course). But honestly when the worst thing about your game is the menu then that's something to celebrate.\n\nThe gameplay is varied and extremely fun with new items to help you sneak around showing up every 15-20 levels and new enemies/obstacles that are immune to those items showing up at about the same rate. The backgrounds and sets are all absolutely gorgeous. The difficulty can spike at times (f'ing lasers) which caused me to breeze through a batch of levels before bashing my head against the wall on one level for as long as I spent on the easy ones combined. And the game itself is incredibly addicting.\n\nI'd highly recommend this game for anyone and everyone. Some mechanical aspects of it could probably use a good spit-shine which may be done in updates, but the core game is still a gem. I'm really looking forward to what Mike Bithell gives us next!","August 24, 2015","true","6.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Each level has the objective of collecting crystals to open up the exit, so it really is more of a guarded maze than a mission, which is a different tone than Metal Gear.\n\nAll that being said, it's a fantastic and really fun game that I think really is unique to itself and probably shouldn't be so compared to Metal Gear.

Indeed, reading the 'Making Of' e-book, the developer takes some time relating in depth his collating of stealth games like Metal Gear and Hitman for inspiration. There's even a humourous anecdote of a meeting between hin and Kojima-san. The e-book, it turns out, is a must-read for all aspiring game developers.\n\nVolume itself takes the gameplay of games like Metal Gear, Hitman, Splinter Cell et al, and distills it into its purest form. But its when the soundtrack kicks in, with its 3-note motif, more than a passing nod to the Tomb Raider theme, that it hits you: above all else, Volume is not just a stealth game, its a fan-made homage to all those games of the 80's & 90's, Tomb Raider included.\n\nGames whose gameplay preceeded 'realism' and, using Tomb Raider as an example, were just a series of conceptual puzzles strung together in a narrative. Volume then is a genuine harkback to those 'golden-days' of gaming.\nSo, avoid guards (and their triangular lines-of-sight), collect orbs to create an exit and use some genuinely fun gadgets.

If you were looking for a stealth game, you're wrong here. Secondly: There is a very very limited amount of options to solve the puzzles - one option to be precise. So far - I'm about 10 levels in - all puzzles had exactly one solution. More often than not, this solution can only be found by trial and error. Example: You can whistle to get guards to leave their posts, but they can only hear you, if you whistle in the dedicated whistling location. Whistle anywhere else and the guards can't be bothered. Because. Come to think of it: This is not a puzzle game either. This is a guess-the-developer's-thoughts kind of game. There's no room for creativity and your problem solving skills won't be challenged either.","October 29, 2015","false","6.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlamesSuperior/recommended/365770/","FlamesSuperior","UpInFlames","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlamesSuperior/","263 products in account","This review was written for FREEDOM Community Gaming Collective[freedomcgc.com].\nStealing from the rich and giving to the poor is an old concept all of us are familiar with. Volume provides a futuristic re-telling of the classic Robin Hood story wrapped up in a tightly designed stealth puzzle package. Players take on the role of Rob Locksley on a journey through one hundred self-contained and relatively short levels mostly to steal information and valuables from the head of a huge and powerful corporation that effectively rules over England.\n\nVolume utilizes an isometric camera. However, when hugging a wall, it shifts to a top-down view so you can get a clearer overview. One of the first things you’ll notice about the game is its clean and simple visual aesthetic. As you go through the game, almost each level features a different color palette. Levels usually consist of only two or three main colors, but they are expertly used to create a striking visual style. Not only is the art style visually pleasing, but it directly facilitates clarity of design. It’s extremely important for stealth games to be instantly clear about everything that is going on, so that the player can effectively plan and react in any given moment. Volume achieves this in an almost effortless way, but it is, in fact, the result of intelligent design.\n\nVolume is actually a simulation within a simulation. As the game starts, Rob hacks and reprograms a hostile artificial intelligence that works for Gisborne, the aforementioned head of Gisborne Industries. The artificial intelligence, Alan, then proceeds to allow Rob access to key locations of the corporation. The story tackles some interesting themes such as the dangers of completely unregulated capitalism, internet celebrities, the fear surrounding artificial intelligence and the ethics of dealing with them. Unfortunately, the problem is that the story isn’t particularly well told. There were some inspired lines that grabbed my attention, but for the most part, it’s rather dull. There are optional texts you can find in each level which provide some backstory, but those are boring for the most part as well. It’s a shame that the story falls flat because the themes it covers are genuinely intriguing.\n\nWhat really makes Volume shine is the design. Levels are pretty much designed as puzzles and it’s up to you to figure out how to finish them without getting yourself killed. Rob cannot kill any of the enemies in the game, he can only hide or otherwise evade them. He has a variety of tools at his disposal to achieve this. The most basic ability, which will actually remain useful throughout the entire game, is getting the attention of guards by whistling in their proximity. For example, hiding behind a wall and whistling will cause the guards to either move from their spot or break their patrolling pattern in order to investigate the noise. You can use that moment and navigate the space they were guarding. Rob can also use the environment and hide in lockers or jump over certain walls. Later on, the game introduces shadows which effectively make Rob completely invisible in certain spots.\n\nHowever, the most interesting way to deal with guards is using various gadgets that you will find in each level. Some gadgets will enable you to distract guards by creating noise or place a shiny item that grabs their attention for a while. Others will allow you to stun guards for a precious few seconds, trick them by wearing a disguise or even turning invisible in the later levels. There’s a healthy amount of gadgets to use and each level is designed around using a single or several gadgets.\n\nThere’s a nice variety of enemies as well. The most basic ones have a standard cone of sight and will just shoot you in the face with their assault rifles. On the other hand, snipers have narrow and long sight range, but they shoot slower. Knights are fearsome and fast melee enemies with a huge line of sight and they’ll hunt you down and hack you up in a heartbeat. Turrets are stationary, but have an exceptionally fast rate of fire. Dogs won’t directly attack you, but they’ll alert nearby guards of your presence. Also, considering they mostly rely on their ability to sniff you out, they can’t be tricked by disguises. All of these elements provide a lot of variety and help to keep the game fresh from start to finish. But the best thing about Volume is how it masterfully pulls off the synergy between these components and creates a coherent whole.\n\nVolume skillfully straddles the line between being challenging and accessible. You will never get stuck on a level without having a clue as to what you’re supposed to be doing. You also won’t feel as if you’re just going through the motions. The difficulty is just right which makes the pacing almost perfect. I also have to single out the sound design and soundtrack both of which fit the game perfectly and help to create a compelling atmosphere. Your completion time of each level will be uploaded online and you’ll be able to see how you stack up against all players and your friends. Apart from the story mode, Volume also features a robust, easy-to-use level editor. Players can upload their levels and download other people’s levels very easily, it’s all just a couple of button presses away. The problem I had with this is that I simply didn’t crave for more. I felt as if I’ve seen everything and simply had no desire to play more levels. It doesn’t really feel like the type of game that could facilitate hours upon hours of gameplay without running out of steam. But for those players who want more, this could be a potentially great way to get more value out of the game.\n\nVolume is a really good stealth puzzle game featuring incredibly balanced design and pacing with a genuinely strong presentation. It just lacks that certain something that would elevate it into truly great territory. Maybe a compelling story or perhaps bolder design would push it into the realm of absolute excellence, I’m not sure. However, the one thing I’m positive about is that Volume is an easy recommendation for anyone looking for a well-designed stealth puzzle game.\n\n7 OUT OF 10 (VERY GOOD)","September 10, 2015","true","11.7"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Seeing returning voice cast along with what seemed like a neat little story concept, an interesting art style and so forth, this had the hallmarks to be another indie darling of a game.\n\nHow wrong I was to be truthful.\n\nFirst I have to say the voice acting, especially on the main character is awful. It's nearly jarring. The computer isn't nearly as bad but the line delivery seems to lack a certain punch to it. The performance feels phoned in which is disappointing. There is a wealth of text based snippets on the floors, these in some cases are quite funny, and I can't help but feel we've been done a disservice by not having them also voice acted.\n\nIt is impossible not to compare the writing and acting to that of TWA, and if you compare the first few levels in each game there is a vast vast difference in terms of things to pull you in. Volume simply has nothing to compel you, the early levels are literally a tutorial with very little story direction or real concept of anything other than learn this thing. You are given literally no context at all during the opening segments to why you are doing anything other than a computer told you so, and not in the Portal kind of way. In the drab, this is the game kind of way.\n\nThe gameplay itself is typical isometric stealth gameplay. That's it. Obviously it has this level editor and so on, but there is nothing more to it. The absence of story or any driving factors early on means there was very little reason for me to continue playing past the 15 minutes or so that I was actually playing. The game touts "100 levels" But the first level is literally walking to the exit and the ones that followed were equally simplistic with next to no dialogue. 100 levels is only a real number if each level is significant content, the first 5 at least were nothing but saying "look! stealth game!"\n\nThe art style as well, when actually playing does not feel like it adds to the experience. For such a minimalistic experience it actually feels overly busy and complex. details such as toilets to flush on the walls etc... aren't particulalry clear features to pick out until you stand next to them and get the text box in some cases.\n\nIt might sound like I'm being overly scathing for having played so little, but this is the age of the steam refund system and the significance of first impressions of a game has never been more apparant with so many games on the market. I am simply not compelled to delve any further because I have not been given any reason for anything I was doing.\n\nA final irksome point is the random phrases spouted by the main character when collecting gems. Some of the phrases harken to elements of the story to do with gaining popularity and noteriety, however none of that has been discussed in the game thus far, yet he is spouting the phrases none-the-less. This dispels all immersion that could have existed.\n\nI'm sorry mister Bithell but I donot think this game is worth £15, to me it has a much less compelling opening than TWA, the voice acting and writing is poorly done on all levels and there is simply nothing here to suggest it is anything but a generic stealth game. I'm sure I could be wrong, but I don't see a reason to delve further. Putting in my refund request now.\n\n--Additional--\n\nOn reflection I believe I should add a few things here for clarity and fairness. At it's core it's a stealth game that works and that much is true, but it's not a stealth game that is worth £15. You can see where your money goes on this one, and it's pretty much on the graphics and voice actors which seems very silly when they are probably the least engaging parts of the game. People who like this game will like it for the stealth and the level editor, but those wanting more substance will be left confused and bored.","August 18, 2015","false","0.4"," 44 of 108 people (41%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","41","44","108","2","3"

It doesn't really break any new ground or absolutely blow you away, but if you enjoy the genre and have the time to spend it's a pretty good little game.\n\n\n","February 8","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not as subtle in the beginning as Thomas Was Alone, but it's storytelling is still pretty good. You should probably play Thomas was alone first, as that will help you understand Volume better.\nThe story is told through dialouge and newspaper articles you find, and if you're expecting something really similar to Thomas was alone, you won't find it here. The stories are connected and are in the same universe (Mild spoiler from 1st hour or so), however the atmosphere and mood are very different. The gameplay is also an interesting breed of puzzle solving and stealth, where your goal is stealth, but acheiving it requires more puzzle solivng than skill and patience. Also you have no way of defending yourself.\nTo illustrate this, all the guards are nearsighted, and have ADHD. You toss something shiny on the wall, the guard says "shiny" and stares at it for a minute or so. It's more about using sound to manipulate their positions and find the right path than most stealth games are.\nIf you played Thomas was alone, you should probably play this, or at least watch a lets play of it.\nBTW each time you start the game a message pops up telling you that Bethell isn't Nintendo, and really wants you to make youtube videos of their game. It gave me a good laugh when I first saw it, but I don't really care otherwise.\nIf you see this on sale, buy it. I got it + Thomas Was Alone for like $6. I doubt it'll go that low again, but if you're unwilling to pay $20 it's still worth it if it goes on sale.","May 20","true","20.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
