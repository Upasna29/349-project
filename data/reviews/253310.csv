Want to see the genre that inspired games like the fantastic, story-driven Telltale Games adventures? Just want to play a fun little storyline that requires a little puzzling to work your way through?\n\nFester Mudd: Curse of the Gold is an episodic Wild West adventure that does homage to those old Lucas Arts SCUMM games without the need for a floppy disk drive or emulator.  Everything is there, from the user interface to the 16-bit graphics. The only thing missing is the Lucas Arts logo.\n\nThe story isn't terribly deep but it's fun to play and leaves you ready for the subsequent episodes, which unfortunately haven't come to Steam in the year plus since Episode 1's release.  The puzzles involve simple character dialogue and finding out which objects are interactive and how they can be used to interact with other objects. Throw in a few fart jokes and some butt-related humor and you've got the ingredients for success!\n\nExcept for the fact that this story ends with a "to be continued" that has yet to actually continue (at least on Steam), Fester Mudd is still worth playing. I do think that the price tag, at $10, is pretty high for the 2-3 hours of content and lack of replayability and suggest you look for this one on sale.","January 4, 2015","true","3.0"," 40 of 41 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","40","41","0","1"

This is the best thing about the game.\nAnd the worst: "The development of Fester Mudd games has been cancelled, and this episode is the only one available"\nThe episode finishes quite well - your brother sent you a message about finding gold, and you arrive to Loamsmouth, where you prepare your journey further after your brother.  The episode finishes with you being on your way towards him (ending with a cliffhanger, so obviously just episode 1 of the promised three), so the story is getting your stuff together in the city.\nAnd the game is some incredible gem, it's such, such a pity that it's cancelled.  Still worth playing, as the episode is concluded, and itself is tons of fun, albeit short.  You can meet the local drinking champion, one of the weirdest gun-store owners I've ever came across,  see a lake full with farting fishes, prove that forces of law was sinfun in loving delicious donuts before they got named "police", and so much more, crammed into this game. A weird thing that crossed my mind after coming across the third (!) implementation of fart in the game (farting fish, whoopie cushion and end scene) - giggling at a fart like Fester does (Tee hee) is maybe not the most mature joke. But it's funny! People laugh at farts, that's why whoopie cushions exist to begin with!\nAnd that's the 90s for me - games and cartoons, when funny didn't had to be mature, but something that was simply funny, and this game perfectly captured the "funny for the sake of being funny" trail of thought while it's genuinely funny  - really witty dialogue, great and a lot anachronism in the game (when something's not in it's correct time, like the ID you need to get has barcodes on it).\nCouple the funny aspect of the game with great and enjoyable soundtrack, sounds of the game similarly presented in good quality, and the game also looks really pleasing.\nI thought that this is an original *old* game, and to be honest I didn't really wanted to bother with it. But for lucky me it's a newer one, and I'm pretty sure it's also easier than the classics, making the game a fantastic and very well-done entry to the oldschool point and clicks, where you actually had to choose your action as well :)  It's such, such a pity that the series got cancelled. I still wholeheartedly recommend it if you can deal with the fact that this episode is quite nicely finished, but the whole story apprently will never will be. Though the price is absurdly high for a 2-3h game - I would recommend you getting for- or below 3$/â‚¬","January 27","true","2.5"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/adventourist/recommended/253310/","adventourist","Adventourist","http://steamcommunity.com/id/adventourist/","120 products in account","The game opens with this statement: "This game is a tribute to the golden era of adventure gaming." I believe it hits the mark, for better and for worse. The "point-and-click" adventure games of the past would be considered difficult and boring by today's standards. Modern gamers probably won't enjoy stepping back in time to play a game requiring a fair amount of patience and critical thinking. But if you remember those days long past with a warm and fuzzy nostalgia, then I don't think you'll be disappointed by this short trip down memory lane. I say "short" because it is only an episode. (The developers did not profit enough to make any more, which I think is unfortunate.) I finished it in roughly 3.5 hours, which is longer than others, but I enjoy exploring every dialogue tree and trying silly things to see what I can make the main character do. While the main character isn't very identifiable, every character is memorable and nobody is a throw-away. I only wish I could hear them speak. The music and pixel art is fitting as a tribute game, though I wish there were a few more close-ups and cut-aways. The puzzles are very well balanced in terms of difficulty, which is no small feat for this genre. I got stuck, but I never felt as though I had nothing to do. I'd simply switch puzzles or try other ideas. I think I stumbled upon a solution or two before I encountered the corresponding problem, but that's forgivable in my book. The very last puzzle was frustrating, but maybe that's fair since it should be the most difficult of the game. The humor ranges from clichÃ© to lough-out-loud (I had several of these moments). There aren't any game-breaking bugs, but I did experience a little glitch where everything blacked out for a moment. Overall, I think it's fun, and worth its sale price. Too bad there weren't any more episodes made; I'd have bought them on sale too.\n\nCaution: There's lots of swearing, which may surprise you since it has a cartoony art style.","March 7, 2015","true","3.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The story is fittingly wacky, the humor fittingly silly, and for once actually finding the achievements is entertaining. It's one of the few point&clicks I've played lately that actually gets the "old-school charm" label right: it's old-fashioned, childish, fun, but not frustrating for a modern audience. As tributes to classic adventure games go, this one gets everything right. Also a great game to play with children, if you're okay with a few cartoony sceletons and a guy stabbed in the back in a saloon. ;)\n\nAll in all it's a very enjoyable way to spend a few hours.

It feels so fresh and retro at the same time. The humor is wonderfully thought out and even the minor characters are memorable. The game keeps the Point & Click tradition of bizarre puzzle solutions so you may need a guide for specific parts, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing considering the genre.\n\nThere are two reasons why I cannot reccommend this title at its current $10 price tag. First, for the amount of money you spend, you won't get much replay value out of it. When you consider Steam sales dishing out titles like borderlands 1 & 2 for a $10 total, games like this become a less worthy investment. Plus, GOG.com has a few Point and Click adventures floating around their site for *FREE*. I think the game could stand more of a chance if it routinely went on sale.\n\nSecond, I haven't heard any news on the game's promised sequels. It's been well over a year now since it released and there haven't been any announcements. Worst case scenario is possibly never seeing the real ending.\n\n\nSo in short, Fester Mudd - Episode 1 has nothing wrong with it gameplay-wise. It's actually a great game. If it were $7 or $8 and had a follow-up in the pipeline, I'd definitely recommend it! If this ever goes on sale, grab it!

It's highly recommended to wait until this title ends up in an Indie Gala or Humble Bundle, or until all three episodes are released; at which time they may be bundled together for one price. Look forward to Episode Two, however wait this purchase out until then.\n\nRating: 3.0/5.0","April 13, 2014","false","1.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","2"

It really respects its antecessors and the genre, works as a nice throwback to those adventure games back in the day and oh boy, it delivered.\nThe story is interesting enough to keep you playing it, in fact, as the game goes on you are more and more invested in the plot thanks to its pretty good puzzles, all of them make sense, some served as a comedy value, some can be challenging.\nTalking about comedy, it is filled with tons of funny dialogues and scenarios, which ones delivered even more entertaining to the game, there are some easter eggs and those are great.\nThe game is quite short, but as you can see it took me above 8 hours, so there is that. Also there are achievements to unlock, which is good.\nAs for flaws goes, I don't have any, really, It might get a little repetitive after a while and I wish there was more variety in the soundtrack, don't get me wrong, is not a bad soundtrack at all, but it might get repetitive as well.\nIn the end I really liked Fester Mudd, it was a great adventure! 8.6/10","January 29","true","8.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I picked it up in a bundle a few months ago and recently decided it would be a nice game to play through on my lunch breaks. The interface is nearly identical to the CD version of Monkey Island. The pixelated graphic style and humor are also reminiscent of classic LucasArts adventure games, but with a wild west flair.\n\nAs Fester Mudd, you receive a letter from your brother Budd requesting your aid in his search for gold. Your goal is to reunite with him, but Fester is woefully unprepared for the excursion. In Episode 1, Fester must find a guide and fetch various supplies before proceeding on his way. Obtaining these items is more difficult than it appears at first, and they require you to follow a slightly convoluted path of puzzles. While I found myself stuck a few times, I just needed to jump back into the game after taking a break and never had to resort to using a guide. I felt that the puzzles were mostly fair and oftentimes quite clever.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this game. It may help that Monkey Island is one of my favorite games and it really feeds off nostalgia for that game. My sole complaint is that only Episode 1 was has been released thus far, and it sounds like Episode 2 might be on hold at the moment. The asking price on Steam is a bit high for only Episode 1, but if it pops up in another bundle I'd definitely recommend fans of classic LucasArts adventure games giving it a try.","March 23, 2015","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Episodic games are difficult to review on their own, because they're bite-sized portions of a greater meal. Well... unfortunately, the meal has been put on ice. This is the only Fester Mudd adventure we'll ever have.\n\nWith all that said, I shall do my best to review this fairly.\n\nFester Mudd is a point-and-click adventure that nails the look and feel classic LucasArts and SCI1.1-era Sierra games. The interface is of the ol' "Look at ___" and "Pick up ____" variety, and the visuals and soundtrack hearken back to the genre's second hurrah in the 90s. The humour is also a throwback to the titles from those development houses. You'll find your sight gags,  pop culture references, and fart jokes -- sometimes, as in the homage to Mel Brooks' classic 'Blazing Saddles', all three will come together in glorious harmony.\n\nOkay, okay, so is this light-hearted western any good? Well, co-creator Josh Mandel (check out his credits!), advisor Al Lowe (his, too!) and the folks at Replay know their stuff. Fester Mudd won't go down as a classic, but the puzzles are fair, and the game doesn't seem to have any real flaws with it aside from the fact that it'll never be completed.\n\nI don't think I'd pay more than $5, but if you can get it in a bundle or on sale ($1.25 on December 23, 2014), I'd absolutely recommend it if you're looking to scratch your classic adventure gaming itch. And if the itch lingers, be sure to see if ol' Doug has something for you at the Drug-- er, I mean Doug Store.","December 4, 2015","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
