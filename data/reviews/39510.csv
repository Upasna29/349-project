The trick that the devs pulled to make the game seem so enormous was to make use of absolutely every nook and cranny on the map. Most of these places aren't even relevant to the main story; you can plow through the game several times over and still stumble across something new hidden in an easily missed gap between rocks or behind a waterfall at the bottom of a deep valley. Since the game doesn't throw powerful items or experience at you like lots of the loot-fest RPGs out there, the (usually) small rewards secreted away across the island are always satisfying to discover. This and the fact that the game is largely loading screen- and objective marker-free makes the whole world feel alive and supremely explorable. Just be careful; the game will hold your hand for a grand total of five seconds before booting you into a world where all of the local fauna have it out for you and will absolutely WRECK you if you aren't familiar with the somewhat clunky combat system. It gets easier later on but the challenge is always there. Don't be scared though; the danger just makes exploring that much more rewarding.","June 19, 2014","true","49.7"," 110 of 116 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","110","116","0","0"

It offers countless hours of gameplay, lot's of sidequests and plenty of things to do besides that, from picking berries in the woods to hunting orcs and other critters in the vast open world filled with forests and grasslands. Appart from the great story, the game has one of the most enjoyable combat systems and exploration features.\n\nAnother thing to mention is the music which also perfectly fits in with the theme and creates an even deeper atmosphere to delve in, however this game isn't  for everyone, the combat can be sometimes found tricky and making money hard, but most players get used to it quickly.\n\nThis is a must-have if you're an old-school RPG fan, 10/10","March 29, 2014","true","17.9"," 74 of 78 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","74","78","0","1"

I bought the game just so I can write a review.\nWhat? Yep.. I did.\n\nFor the last 12 years I played Gothic franchise. Every winter, when the weather goes bad outside, I have to follow my tradition of playing one of the Gothic games. For 12 years...\n\nIf you read this far and you never played this game but you call yourself a RPG fan, then do yourself a favor and buy it!\nBuy it and play it for at least 1 hour. This is how long it will take you to get used to the controls and to  the open-world-no-hand-holding ideology.\n\nIf I could wrap up the review in some simple words, they would be: Gothic = immersion.\n\nThis is a common scene that you will find in Gothic 2:\nHeavy grey sky, raining. It's night and you see the soldiers gathering around a camp fire and chat. One of them even starts roasting the carcass of a hunted animal over the fire, preparing the dinner. The merchants sit down in front of big water pipes and relax, smoking different types of weeds. An owl can be heard in the forest close to the camp while through the trees, you can see some Scavangers going to sleep for the night. You decide to also sit on a log and enjoy some socialization time after all the fighting and hunting done over the day.\n\nPros:\n- solid story with deep lore, a mix between religion, mysticism and politics.\n- unprecedented AI behavior! Seriously, this franchise is 16 years old but even today the Ai scripting, behavior and combat is unmatched in any other RPG. Sure some other games excel in certain segments of AI implementation, but overall, you wont see a more vivid and realistic AI.\n- a true open world. If you see something in the distance, you will most likely be able to reach and explore it. There are many level designers that can provide good content with a large world, but only geniuses can make every inch of a small world filled with content.\n- your actions matter. Stealing from someones house or chest? Bad idea. Beating up some important NPC that has many friends and connections? Really bad idea. Betraying a whole faction and be responsible for their deaths? Awesome!\n- a very natural and diverse quest system. Make friends, make enemies, steal, hijack, frame some or prove the innocence of others in order to unlock more quests.\n- choose your path. This is not Skyrim or Mass Effect. Once you chosen a faction, there is no turning back! Playing each faction it's basically a separate playthrough. This is how much the game changes depending on the path taken!\n- absolutely beautiful soundtrack, realistic nature sounds and good voice over.\n\nCons:\n- somewhat awkward control scheme, but it's consistent! Once you learn to handle it, the controls feel smooth.\n- outdated graphics. D'oh! 16 years old engine.\n- almost no hand holding. No flashing quest marks over NPC heads, no minimap, no pointers all over the screen (probably this is also a reason why the game is so immersive... nothing to distract you from the actual game)\n- high difficulty in combat, but not unfair!\n- access violation error for some systems, that can be easily solved by running the game in Windows XP SP2 compatibility mode + Administrator rights.\n\nBy today standards the game is 7 / 10. But, by taking a look at the game industry today... this game is a 10/10 from head to toes. This is a rough gem that deserves a chance to be discovered.\n\nPiranha Bytes, thank you for creating Gothic series.

If you patch the game corectly it is pretty stable. and in my opinion the only real draw back for buying it on steam is minimizing the game.  other wise it seems more stable then the stand alone.

What a great, rewarding and exciting game.\n\nAfter a series of events, you break out of the colony with friends you made there. Freedom, right? No.\nYou weren't the only one to break out. Most bandits got out too and started to rob and murder innocent citizens of Khorinis. People see you as a nobody yet again, but slowly you gain respect and eventually become a respected man across the island, saving Khorinis from an evil force that's about to struck it.\n\nGameplay is improved in many ways over the first game. Controls don't feel stiff. Combat is fun and never gets old: you hold LMB and use WASD to swing your weapons in different directions, no button mashing involved.\nYou can join different factions: Paladins, Mercenaries and Mages. All of them are very different and have a lot of faction-related quests, so it's worth it to beat the game multiple times.\nYou visit a lot of places in the game: the main island of Khorinis, the colony from the first game (which is now abandoned, grey and full of orcs at every step that'll murder you in mere seconds), swampy Jarkendar from the expansion and some other minor ones. All locations are unique and different, NPCs have their own chores and the game feels alive. I'll be honest, I got immersed. I spent hundreds of hours wandering around and finding cool quests and secrets.\n\nGothic II is my favourite RPG and I beat it many times. It's the experience I will never forget.","September 13, 2014","true","132.2"," 56 of 59 people (95%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","95","56","59","5","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrfenixlt/recommended/39510/","mrfenixlt","MrFenixLT","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrfenixlt/","189 products in account","So let`s start: Gothic 2 is second part of RPG saga Gothic and balh blah blah (Wikipedia.org says that ). But I want to start from my point of weave and tell what I think about it: Gothic 2 was one of the first (first was Gothic 1) RPG`s I got my hands on my in my childhood, back in 2002 it was something unbelivible and awesome in terms of lore, combat, magic... and at the same time it wasnt ovrloaded like modern RPG`s with stuff you dont need.\n\nGood side: Gothic 2 was briliant game and "Piranhas" managed to fix those problems they had in gothic 1 (exept those that were not possible to fix thx to engine limitations as I know) game is friendly to those who are new to the world of Gothic and kingdom of Myrthana and those who know it from privious game. Every NPC that was in first part almost ask you do you styll remember him or not so you can learn something about him. Gameplay: game play is devided in chapters that make game slightly harder to beat if you just fast run from point A to point B, after release of Night of Raven (and latter the Gold edition that we have here) game became biger and harder to finish at fast run. another good side is Open world that has its own life: from fealds with insects , to forests with wolves and ancient secrets in them and to swamps filled with flys and other animals that could kill you just because you went there. Oh... and almost forgot: Gothic 2 have dragons and they are more brutal then in Sky***.\n\nBad side of gold: First bad side is some texture glitches aspecialy in darkness, second patch used in Gold forces you to search for patch that downgrades game version so you could instal some mods on it. And ofc age of graphys could scare new people who want to try this game. and maybe some problems with searching quest locations. and there were problems with Win 7 as I remember but I belive drivers were fixed on video cards so that problem was solved\n\nall in all: Gothic 2 Gold is an RPG that every fan of genrie should try no matter of problems that may accure as they should brake your PC in half as it gives you plenty of time to waist and you will want to try other paths of game play to see what could have be done differently. I hope I helped and make you reader interested in this game and you will spend your time with joy.","November 25, 2013","true","64.5"," 52 of 59 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","52","59","0","1"

It’s truly an open world adventure that has absolutely no hand holding. Brutal yet fair, it’s not for everyone. Personally, I enjoyed the game despite its weird user-interface. Yet in hindsight, it actually served well enough as, in parts, can be quite immersive. Two years later, and to my surprise, Gothic 2 hit the markets. This game took all the strengths of Gothic 1 and enhanced it a hundred times – so much it makes Gothic 1 looks like a tech demo. Yet there are some slight weaknesses like the user interface however it’s minor comparing to what the game can offer overall.\n\nDepending what you want from this game determines the length of time to complete. For me, I tried to complete everything possible from picking up every plant to completing all of the quests possible. Even I used to walk option to explore any new areas so it took me around 100 plus hours to complete all six chapters. And the beauty of this is that, the game had a really decent pace to it – other words, it didn’t feel like a chore at all. That said, Gothic 2 is a game that RPG players will be proud of. It has all the elements of a proper RPG ranging from interacting to combat to exploration. The UI still needs tailoring however, after a little practice, it’s passible and won’t cause too much grief. An absolute must for any lovers of RPGs yet newcomers will find this a little too daunting.\n\nFull review here: http://www.gamespot.com/gothic-ii/user-reviews/2200-12659434/\n\n9 / 10","August 25, 2015","true","0.2"," 39 of 43 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","39","43","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SupererMuffin/recommended/39510/","SupererMuffin","Spatharokandidatos SuperMuffin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SupererMuffin/","70 products in account","This is by far the best game you will ever play. I have personally never played a better RPG. I will now go into detail about why this is the best way to spend your money on a game.\n\nFirst of all the story: If you have played Gothic 1 you will get to meet many of your old friends again. I personally played Gothic 1 after Gothic 2, and it didn't matter alot. Most of the dialogues give you the option to navigate around having met them before (in Gothic 1), but I surely do encourage you to play Gothic 1 before since it will greatly improve your enjoyment when meeting your old brothers again. The story continues perfectly with twists and new problem and adventures to explore. Honestly, the story is probably the best thing about this game, it just makes you love the characters, form realtionships, go on quests together and knock on baddies heads.\n\nNow to the Wolrd and its design: Epic. That's the only word you need to describe Gothic 2s' worlds. Piranha Bytes has the best team when it comes to creating maps. Every inch is used to its maximum potential, there are a big variety of different locations, each one unique and special in some way. In every corner there is a secret to discover or a unknown Boss-Mob to defeat. In Gothic 2s' worlds every step feels special, there is always something you didn't notice on your first walk along a path.\n\nFurthermore to the gameplay: Gothic isn't a game that babysits you through your playtime. You get thrown into the cold water (literally in Gothic 1 :) ), noone is there to show you where to go for a quest, no markers on your UI, no markers on the maps, nothing. It just feels like you are really in that world, wandering around not knowing where to go or who you will meet behind the next turn. It surely is a hardcore RPG experience, the controls might feel weird at first, but you will get the hang of it quiet fast. The combat might seem a little hard at the start, you will feel like your hero is good for nothing, you will get beat up alot. You are weak at the start, but once you get your first proper sword and armor, you can wreck **** up!\nGothic has a basic, but good level and skill system. Though I must say it's strongly unbalanced without the proper mods installed (I will get to that later). You can do anything that is possible in a medieval world: Fight with one-handed and two-handed swords, use bows and crossbows, shoot magic bolts, summon undead creatures or let fire rain upon your enemies.\n\nA few personal notes about the game: I almsot can't describe the game in words, it's just the most epic, legendary, bestest, amazingest game you will ever play. If you don't give a damn about graphics like me and just play for the gameplay and the story, then this is perfect for you. Just ignore the graphics ( they were good for the time the game was first released ), once you are in a playsession nothing will matter to you but the game and the story. You will have at least 50 hours of pure joy during the story, if you only play through the story, if you suck out the maximum potential of the game you can spend atleast 300 hours trying out different guilds, different character skilling, exploring side-quest ( there is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ), or just wandering in the wildness slaying mobs and gazing at the epicness of this game.\nI think the addon could've been implemented better into the game. I am saying this as someone who has played the game withouth the addon first. I just didn't feel it in the addon, it seemed a little empty, but it surely offers A TON OF AWESOME LOOT and more old friends from Gothic 1 to meet. It just didn't, didn't do it, if you know what I mean, it felt kinda sloppy. The world could've been used more in the addon, more like the main map.\n\nNow to the comability issues everyone is talking about:\nIf you think it just buy game, download, play, you are mistaken, soooooo deeply msitaken.\nIt is incredibly hard to get this game running if you have no idea how "modding" works, or if you are installing the game for the first time. You need 3 different communitypatches at least and a ton of configuring the game files. Thanks to the community over at WorldOfGothic though its not that hard, they helped me install it a couple of times too. It is definitly worth the trouble though, this game is so incredibly epic it just has to be played.\nContinueing on that is the bad balancing the addon brings in, I STRONGLY advise to install a rebalancing mod (I use minimod balance), because the level/skill system is stupid in the normal state ( you will notice yourself though).\n\n\nFinishing this long post:\nGothic 2 is the best game ever created and anyone not playing it is missing out on alot.\n\nThanks for reading my rather long review, it is my first and I just couldn't express how I feel about the game..\nP.S.: sorry for any spelling-errors, am too tired to proof read this ;P","March 29, 2015","true","4.5"," 28 of 30 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","28","30","3","3"

I grew up with this game, like back then I now still love the game. It is not only nostalgia which makes me praise this game but the lively world. The memorable characters with their voices, actions and characteristics are something what not every game can offer. The atmosphere of the whole world is unique and never gets boring, as you wander through dark dungeons or peasants fields. Every place offers new persons to speak with, quests to aquire, monsters to slay and equipment to find. Most quests are designed thoughtfully and always have a story behind. Rarely you will find a quest which requires to bring X to Y. If it is the case then you will still enjoy it, as you enjoy the atmospheric environs. The game contains many kinds of weapons, from swords to crossbows, and many consumable items. Every character in the game has some kind of disposition and ethos, they react if you steal them, hit them or betray them to the milita. So you have to be careful what you do. In addition, the soundtrack of this game is marvellous and never gets boring, no matter how often I listen to it.\n\nI have spent many hours with this game and appreciate its atmosphere and complex world everytime.\n\nFurthermore I want to mention the level of difficulty of the game. I can understand that this game is difficult to master for players new to RPGs. Additionally the partly clumsy controls do not make it easier to survive, but I bid everyone to give the game a try. It just takes a bit time to understand the mechanics and to get used to the controls.","October 20, 2015","true","38.8"," 25 of 27 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","25","27","0","0"

(New Vegas might come close, but is crippled by Bethesda's idiotic VATs combat.)\n\nThe game's heart is driven by a well balanced progression that feels really damn good. The satisfaction of growing from an unknown, unliked hero who runs away from wolves to a master swordsman who slays mighty beasts has never been captured so well. Sure, every game does it, but here, you feel that change viscerally, and it's damn satisfying. Starting the game not as the Savior of Mankind but a hopeless wimp might rub some people the wrong way but I can't get enough of that sort of thing.\n\nI also very much enjoyed the main city. Very convincing as a living place. Damn near every person you meet has something going on. You could easily spend five hours getting things done in the first city alone.\n\nThe map is huge, and rewards exploration, and while games like Oblivion might also offer that, here your exploration is lended a sizable amount of tension, as you never know what might be lurking around the corner ready to tear your head off, or what treasures you might find.\n\nAnother thing I found well considered  is that each piece of gear carries a significant amount of weight. Though you may only wear a few sets of armor throughout the game, getting that first upgraded fills you with a sort of glee as you start to imagine all those difficult places you may now be able to explore. It also adds a certain element of realism to the entire experience, which aids in the immersion, which is nice in a game like this.\n\nChoice and consequence isn't a huge part of the game, but in choosing who you ally with, there is plenty enough of that, if that's something you worry about. And many quests do give you at least one or two minor options in how you complete it.\n\nThe plot and writing aren't anything special, but the intaraction between all the guilds and your hero is well done, and it's perfect for a game like this, where your only wish is to be left alone as you run all over the map. The voice acting is stellar. Bad, but in a way that knows it's bad. So it's good!\n\nThe game obviously isn't terribly pretty, and it can be hard getting it to run on new operating systems (check the guides), but if this is your jam, then you better make some toast, because Gothic 2 is a big delicious helping of open world goodness!\n\n6/10 IGN GOTY!!!\n\nNo, but seriously, guys. It's pretty good.","March 22","true","79.3"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","20","21","0","3"

The controls take some getting used to but with a bit of effort soon become second nature. It may be dated graphically with blocky models and stiff animations but surprisingly the texture work is very good and in some places even outshines some modern games (which is depressing - get your ♥♥♥♥ together developers). I recommend playing Gothic 1 before 2 because the second game builds heavily upon the characters, story and setting from the first game and certain parts from 2 will feel more rewarding after having finished Gothic. Having played both games for the first time in the year of our lord 2013 I can say without the slightest trace of nostalgia that Gothic 1 & 2 ranks high amongst the finest of western RPGs.","December 22, 2013","true","117.7"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","22","25","0","0"

This feels more real than in games like Skyrim, for example. You choose your faction and this is exclusive.\n\nThere is alchemy and there are various forms of magic.

One of the best features in my mind that Gothic Series especially Gothic 2 have are the NPC. They don't feel like they are just there for a quest, but rather are a part of the living world. Things happen to them too, while you experience your adventure. Some of them even guide you in this adventure by trading with you, fighting by your side, even training you and just sharing usefull information. This is strongly supported by the great level design, while it is open to you it has many interesting places and characters for you to find, but also traps and obstacles to avoid.

The 2nd best game is probably the first Gothic. Playing both parts sequentially, the story and gameplay is just so epic. When you get to meet your old buddies from Gothic 1, in Gothic 2 world, you're just so full of joy. And when you're finally going back to the 'Valley of Mines'(where all the action of 1st Gothic happens at), and see how everything's changed, you just feel so epic. I can't even describe the feeling I got, when I first entered Valley of Mines in Gothic 2.\nYes, the game is old, graphics aren't the best, and combat is often mistaken as 'broken' or glitchy or in any other way bad. But I think that the combat is one of the parts where the first two Gothic games shine the most! It takes a bit getting used to, but it's atleast not mindless LMB clicking or just 1 button. You actually have to use some kind of tactics for different monsters. If you're not careful even a pack of Scavengers could kill you - the High Mage of Fire, Dragon hunter or Paladin(depending who you join).\nAnd talking about graphics again, yes they don't have the sharpest textures, or the 'super cool' bloom effects or any other postfx's. But the game still looks brilliantly, especially for such an old game. I much prefer these kinds of visuals, than the overly realistic ones in games nowadays.\nAnyways, I could talk about it all day, just go ahead and buy the damn game!

There are hundreds of individual characters (sadly with reused voice actors, although they at least managed to mix up their way of speaking a bit) and most of them will send you on errands, trade with you or beat your ♥♥♥ if you disrespect them.\n\nAs in the other Gothic (or Risen) games there are three main factions, one of which you'll have to join to advance in the main questline. For simplicity's sake those factions could be described as fighters, mages and something in between (Paladins)- each of them plays differently, just like you could expect from the according RPG archetypes. Each of the factions and locations comes with heaps of sidequests, all in all there are hundreds of them.\n\nThe controls are a bit outdated as it is very keyboard heavy and the combat system takes some (or lots of) getting used to as it relies almost completely on your chance to do critical hits, which of course is very low in the beginning of the game, possibly making the first few hours very difficult.\nAs the game is 10 years old, the visuals won't win any prizes. But the game still manages to deliver a very dense atmosphere and consistent visual feeling.\nThe audio on the other hand is still great. You'll get a great soundtrack (although some tracks are looped heavily), nice voice acting (I've played the German version as its the one I played when the game first was released but I read that in the English version there are renowned voice actors like Keith Szarabajka of Skyrim and Fallout:NV fame) and fitting ambiance sounds.\n\nA few words warning though: with the expansion Night of the Raven pre-installed, the game is very hard for beginners. You'll get your hindside kicked. Again and again. But in Gothic 2 there's always a way to complete your task.\nYou have to kill a strong monster early in the game? Look around in town if there's someone willing to accompany you on your hunt. Or go to the local scroll merchant and buy a spell to transform yourself into a strong monster. Or you could even just try to get the monster's attention and lure it to the city guards.\nEven as a Gothic veteran there are still possibilities and ways to complete a quest I never thought of.\n\nGet this game. It can be punishing as hell, but if you love RPGs like I do, it is an experience you'll not wanna miss.","January 18, 2014","true","46.2"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/furrjacker/recommended/39510/","furrjacker","Furr Jacker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/furrjacker/","262 products in account","Gothic 2 is an Action-RPG, it's the sequel to the first Gothic game and it continues the story from where the first game ended. After defeating the final boss in the first game (I don't want to spoil who it is) all hell breaks loose, there's a war, and it's up to you to get ♥♥♥♥ done once again. After nearly dying at the end of the first game, Xardas saves you and tells you about your quest to get the Eye of Innos, a powerful artifact that will help you end the war that's going on right now. And thus after the conversation with Xardas you set off into an adventure that you'll surely not forget.\n\nThere isn't much to be said about this game that wasn't said about the first one. It's basically everything the first game was but bigger and much better. It looks a bit nicer than the first game, thanks to the new setting and locations there's much more color now, with lush green forests and a big city to explore. You also get to go back to the Valley of Mines from the first game to see what happened to it after the events of the previous game. I also have to mention the soundtrack, it's incredible, it really adds a lot to the atmosphere and I love it.\n\nGameplay is basically the same, there's a noticeable difference in the combat though, now you can no longer block, you instead have a parry which doesn't work on monsters and animals, so you'll have to think a bit better about fighting those now. Like the first game, the character progression for the nameless hero you play as is phenomenal, you start off completely worthless and throughout the game you see yourself becoming a complete juggernaut of death and by the end of it, it's ridiculously satisfying.\n\nThe "Gold Edition" of the game comes with the expansion pack, "Night of the Raven". It increases the difficulty of the game due to popular demand (you people are masochists) so the game is even more brutally difficult, it adds pirates and a whole new area with more story and quests for you to do. I liked everything in the expansion pack except for two things: The end boss fight, which felt like it was more based on luck whether you kill him or not and it just comes down to constantly reloading your save after every death until you finally kill him, which isn't the case in the entirety of the expansion or Gothic 2 as a whole, it's always fair; and the other thing I didn't like was the way they shoehorned the expansion into the main game. At a certain point in the main quest, the game halts your progression and tells you to do one thing without really any direction or hints as to how to do it. I had to do some research online to see what the hell this is all about and I ended up finding out that this is the game's way of saying "Okay, you can't go any further until you complete the expansion pack so get to it". I was happy to find out that there's more content to this game but I feel like the way they implemented the transition between the main game and the expansion pack is terrible. Still, the expansion pack itself is great.\n\nBasically, if you liked the first game there's no reason you wouldn't like the second one. It's a fairly hard game to get in to so if you're looking to get into the series I'd highly suggest you play the first game before playing this one, it'll ease you into it. It isn't a game that I can recommend to anyone because we live in an age full of whiny little kids who are used to objective markers and hand-holding, Gothic 2 doesn't like any of that, it's harsh, and if you're looking for a hard game that respects your intelligence and knows you can handle things on your own, this is one of the best.","May 26, 2015","true","102.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

You will start as a wimp that gets a beating from pretty much everything, but if you don't get discouraged, stick around and work hard for it, your character will be steadily getting stronger. You will be an adventurer, exploring the well crafted world, trying to find every creature that you can handle (and avoiding the ones you can't), every piece of loot which you can add to your bottomless inventory, and every person in need of your help, just so you could get some experience and become a bit tougher. And doing so will feel incredibly good.\n\nSure, the voice acting isn't the greatest, the combat and animations are clunky, and the graphics may seem bad (even though they're not), but you won't be paying attention to any of this after you sink into the world of Gothic. This game (and the first one) is a cult classic for a reason and if you're a fan of RPGs, you simply have to play it because it's one of the best.","February 24","true","87.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

It features exiting fights, lots of different skills, three different 'paths' to choose from, and loads of things to discover.\n\nFirst, the positive:\nGothic 2 is much smoother than Gothic 1. It's easier to use, less clunky, and merchants are easier to deal with now that gold is introduced as opposed to trading items all the time. Timing is important during fights, but so is picking your opponent.\nGothic 2 doesn't hold your hand at any stage of the game: if you make the mistake of wandering into the woodland armed with a wooden stick at level one, well, it's your funeral. The NPC's give advice, though, but you'll have to find them and ask them.\nYou'll also have to build your character from the ground up: you start with a little health, and a huge problem the game needs you to solve.\nLevelling always feels important and vital to the game, be it your stats or your gear. The game makes every improvement you make feel valuable. This is because if you don't level up and face something stronger than you, chances are you're going to die.\nAll this makes playing the game incredibly rewarding. I felt genuinely satisfied every time I accomplished something, because I worked for it. Gothic won't punish you by being overly difficult: it'll just make you work.\n\nBut just in case you get too stressed grinding through the game, don't worry. After you get strong enough, you'll find some enemies easy to throw around if you skip around some of the earlier stages of the game you missed before. Destroying things that once scared the pants off you makes everything feel better. This feeling will dissapear if you accidentally stray next to a higher level enemy quite quickly though, keeping an incredibly fun cycle of victim and bully going strong until the end of the game: it never gets dull. Either you're happy and feel like a boss, or you're running for your life, and it's not something a game does for me often.\n\nExploration is also rewarding: loads of secrets are hidden all around the world. Some of the best items and deadliest enemies lurk where you wouldn't expect. Sometimes quest items or NPC's can be hidden in the middle of the countryside, but unlike Skyrim, you can't follow a little arrow on your compass until you come across it. Find it on your own.\n\nAs for the world itself, it's an open world, but that doesn't mean you can go anywhere you want. Higher level monsters lurk in some areas and mountains and cliffs box you in a lot of the time. This means that over a small area, there can be a lot of stuff that's hidden: under an ordinary country road could be a huge cave full of glorious, glorious loot, but at the same time, on top of the cliff to your left might be an epic monster, and you'd never even know unless you looked.\n\nNow, the bad:\nI had problems getting Gothic 2 to work on my computer. Whilst I eventually got it to work, it's a messy problem that took a patch to fix. There may be betters ways to get the game than on Steam.\n\nNight of the Raven messed with the levelling system a lot. Before, I found the game to be difficult, but fair. Not so much now: items need much higher strength to use. This means you have to gain more levels just to use a sword you could previously use at a lower level. You also end up needing to go up even more levels to gain more stats, which was frustrating considering that I was having a hard enough time facing orcs before Night of the Raven. I didn't really appreciate the content it brought to the game either: in a world of dragons, knights, and medieval monsters, I didn't really think that pirates or aztec temples really fit. There was great nostalgia value from meeting some of the characters from Gothic 1 in the expansion, though, but I didn't feel they balanced the stuff I didn't like enough. If Gothic came without Night of the Raven, I would have much preferred that... either that or I became a bad player over these past few years (which I doubt).\n\nFinally, the gameplay might not please some people. I spent a long time praising Gothic 2 for being difficult and rewarding, but for a more casual player, it may be a bit too brutal to get used to. The fighting system isn't the same as anything I've ever seen, and it isn't the most fluid to use. Sure, with practice, you get it, but you may not necessarily want to.\n\nAnd now, my closing statement:\nGothic 2 is a classical fantasy RPG that combines some of my favourite tropes from the genre: wizards, knights, and epic, evil, hard to kill, not-at-all-watered down DRAGONS, but without making it feel too generic. The wizards (oh, I'm sorry... fire magicians) feel halfway between priests, scientists, and diplomats, and the dynamic between the paladins and the mercenaries is really well done. Choices you make have some of the most unexpected consequences making choosing a path truly unique and giving the game some great replayability.\n\nGothic 2 with Night of the Raven: 8/10\nGothic 2 in all it's glorious alone-ness: 10/10","December 30, 2014","true","28.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

For the others: G2 is a open world RPG in a dark and somewhat rough medieval fantasy setting. Mature themes and swearing are included. Expect to die a lot because it takes a long time for the character to become powerful - many times enemies will just one-shot you. The game is really hard on the casual player - there are no easy rewards, death will occur within the first gaming hour. Similar to the witcher series your choices matter and people will have their revenge on you. There are three factions and you habe to stick with one: Mercenaries, Paladins or Mages.\nG2 is from 2002, outdated and there might be issues on high-end systems. Still it's fun to explore the countryside, loot a cave, hunt monsters and survive a tough fight. The add-on doubles the fun by adding a second world to plunder.

For example in the starting area, you're mostly fighting wolves, but there's also an Orc, which are NOT to be ♥♥♥♥ed with at this point. They are twice your size, and hit like a steaming train. But like a train can be sidestepped quite easily.\n\nWith perseverence and cunning, you can defeat foes that you normally shouldn't be able to, instead of just standing in place hacking away at an enemy that's designed to die by you just standing and hacking at it. If you know what I mean.\n\nAnyways, exploration is also greatly rewarded, for example you can find a huge bag of gold coins behind some random tree (and gold is a pretty big deal in this game, its not just for buying generic longsword +2 ♥♥♥♥) or get a finely crafted sword from an expert fighter's grave that was hidden in a makeshift mausoleum inside a cave that was swarming with giant cave-dwelling carapiece-plated bugs.\n\nYeah it's a pretty cool game, wish more games went this route with game design, the effort in -> pay out make it so much more damn satisfying than generic bland grey difficulty all the way through.","August 19, 2013","true","23.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","2"

Melee combat requires timing rather than button mashing and even the most trivial of enemies can kick your butt at the early levels.  Of course the game has its rough points such as mediocre voice acting (English version), the occasional bug, and a somewhat poorly thought out magic system.

If you're willing to put in the time and effort, and there will be quite the effort, you'll find a truly wonderful RPG. Gothic 2 managed to iron out a few of the rougher edges of the first Gothic. The controls have improved, the glitches are fewer and less troublesome and the technical aspects of the game are much improved. I love this game. I loved the first one, I loved Gothic 2 when it first came out in North America in 2003 and I loved Gothic 2 Night of the Raven.\n\nGothic 2 Gold is the proper mix of quests, exploration and combat. But make no mistake, you will die. This isn't Dark Souls, but it can be brutal. The first ten or so hours see your character, no matter which class you choose, as pretty under powered. Enemies are tough and it's not always just wolves or orcs that will kill you. The controls are a bit stiff and until you get used to them, can get you killed. There are factions to join which can somewhat dictate which abilities you can learn, but no matter which faction you choose to side with you can choose how you want to progress. If you want to be a pure fighter, with a two handed sword, fine. A mage that casts massive fire spells, sure. A thief that likes to hang back, and use his bow, not a problem. Gothic 2 lets you decide and mix and match.\n\nAlthough the game play is wonderful, I found the story in the first Gothic to be superior. Gothic 2's story is still engaging and fun, but it's not exactly the most original story telling in modern gaming, but still enough to keep you going. The music is effective if not a bit repetitive. The voice acting is where Gothic 2 really shines. In no other game will you hear such a varied and bizarre mix of voice actors. Some of them are terrible, which just makes me love them more. And finally the graphics are somewhat average. Even for 2002 they were a bit dated, but the draw distance is pretty impressive, especially for a game from 12 years ago.\n\nGothic 2: Gold holds a special place in my heart. It may not have a million mods like Skyrim, a massive budget like Dragon Age or a sound track like GTA 5, it's still great. There aren't too many RPG's out there like the Gothic series and Gothic 2 is still my favourite in both the Gothic and Risen series. It's fun, frustrating, exhilarating, challenging, engaging and satisfying. You could easily put 60 hours into your first play through and even more on a second if you're will to explore every bit that the game has to offer. For the price it's hard to pass up.\n","July 9, 2014","true","38.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

With it's rough and coarse environment the game manages it to create an inventive atmosphere. The open world is well-thought and wonderfully interlaced. Every corner just perfectly fits to the surrounding. Gothic II can be homey, exciting, spooky, exploration promting, beautiful and dark.\nThe player meets a lot old friends from and continoues outright the story of Gothic I.\nAlso the music sounds beautiful, continuing the path of it's prequel yet discovering new tones. All in all the game experience is that coherent that it doesn't matter that the ending is quite weak. The developers -Pyranha Bytes- were never good at creating extremely sophisitcated stories.\nBut, hell, they know how to create a gameworld that's even prettier than life.\n\nSince Gothic II continues the story of Gothic I, I recomend to play Gothic I first. Yet it is not mandatory since the game manages to let the player dive into it's world, as it were her/his everyday world - just more exciting.","October 27, 2013","true","63.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

They improved some ideas from G1 and botched a thing or two in the middle.\nFirst, there are less bugs, but only because they removed ladders and winches. Sometimes, the game freezes and you are forced to kill it via task manager.\nThe game world is pretty big (the expansion in the gold edition adds a nice chunk) and there is a lot to do.\n\nIn G1 you could forge swords, albeit ♥♥♥♥♥♥. In G2 it becomes a learning path and it lets you forge the best swords in the game. They also added alchemy to craft potions, buuuut...\n1- no batch crafting, one potion at a time, and it's really boring;\n2- because the main ingredient of every recipe is more or less scarce, the rest will clutter your inventory with cheap herbs with low healing power.\n\nThe learning system got gimped in an attempt to prevent the player to become a murder machine like in G1, I guess. Capping the main skills is really expensive this time, not counting accessory skills. The mage path is a pain in the ♥♥♥ because of this: you have to spend points for mana, magic circles and rune crafting, maybe alchemy. You can't just have everything. Also, the merchants restock only between chapters, so if you consume every mana potion available in a chapter, you're screwed (had to cheat my way out of chapter 4 because of this).\n\nRanting apart, the game is actually good. Be sure to look around for tweaks like the Ironkeep Patch and the quicksave button. Also, disable the Steam overlay for this game, because it crashes with it.","July 22, 2013","true","149.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In contrast to a lot of other RPGs where the world was just there without a believable background, Gothic II creates this world where every character fits in, where the smallest details manage to convey an atmosphere that is superb.\nAlso, this game easily gives you 35 to 40 hours of play time, maybe even more on your first playthrough. The replayability value is high as well, because you will want to optimize your hero even more the next time around. Maybe go for another faction, maybe go for another speccing.

Story is very, very interesting from start to end, story is very interesting, well written and very fun.\nCombat is pretty much same as in Gothic 1 except learning, now instead of learning only several times you have like progression bar and the more you spend and higher your % the better you are with that weapon type. It is okay change, i wouldn't say it made game better or worse it's okay and that's good. Combat at later level when you have been trained in one art or another becomes very timing based which was in RPG like this, enjoyable.\nWorld is very interesting to explore, same as with Gothic 1 areas in which you shouldn't yet go are protected by stronger opponents, as far as i understood there is no level scaling which makes exploration very rewarding and fun once you get stronger and stronger, you have to remember places were you couldn't go before and can now as you have become stronger then you were back then.\nAs in Gothic 1 there are several factions to join, each faction have quests which you couldn't access if you joined other factions which gives game certain level of replayability. Cons:   Game will probably not start if you do not tweak and install few patches for it.\nYour game may experience framerate issues, they can be fixed by yourself too.\nGame may freeze or to be correct it can become a slideshow, all you see is a picture after picture, if that happens it may go off by itself or you can save and load that save and it will disappear, happened to me twice.\nGothic 2 has been changed in several ways but neither one of them made game worse, for 15 year old game it has aged well IF you can fix all issues you will have when you 1st time run it.\n\nHaving amazing story, fun combat and interesting world to explore but suffering from few technical issues which can be fixed, this game is must play even after all those years, 10 out of 10, classic.","May 29","true","49.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is one of the deepest modern-styled RPG's you'll find. With an excellent character leveling system, a massive world to explore, a decent storyline, and tons of challenge (almost too much so, actually), Gothic 2's definitely worth checking out for any RPG fan, but especially the ones who like deep, difficult games.","March 24, 2011","true","3.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

Similar to its predecessor, it tries to make you feel like the underdog, but if you played the first game you wold find this laughable, still it is the best game of the trilogy.\nYou have to work your way making new friends and work up the food chain, again. This time however the game has a weird limitation that makes you over-dedicate to one class, from 1-30 any skill can be obtained with 1 LP, from 31-60 with 2LP, from 61-90 with 3LP, making some skills to expensive to improve, there are potions and tablets that can improve youțre skills, but you should keep at least until you get to 60 at that skill.\nThe game has some translation issues, and because of the update to the gold version some information the NPCs give you regarding leveling of some skills does not apply, even some walktroughs had the old version with the old stats.\n\nCombat : again all combat is auto-lock, making it difficult when fighting more than one enemy, and also Random crits for the ENEMIES, cause that is fun!\nmelee combat is improved even though you can still use the one from G1,  however if you simply attack a enemy when they charge at you and backstep twice, you can kill most of them easy. (Chapter 3 has mages attacking you, where you simply mash the attack key.)\nrange combat is better than the one in G1, I mostly used it by climbing on pillars and ledges the orcs cold not get to and hit them at point blank, exploiting the AI.\nmagic felt opp, but because I was not a mage, I only had scrolls to compare it to, you can kill creatures you are definitely not prepared to kill very early on with the right scrolls. And also to summon a distraction for the dragons to attack while I go from behind.","March 16, 2015","true","110.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

However, do NOT buy this on Steam. Like with everything else, they just dumped in their DRM and sold a non working product. Good luck googling patches and fixes (manual edits etc.) on german sites to make it work. If you buy it on GoG, it will work out of the box. Also, I would highly recommend getting the version without the expansion. As great as the expansion is, it adds a really illogical rebalance to the game mechanics, not only making everything far harder, but making some game styles unplayable. For example, you can no longer be a mage, since there is no mana regeneration and it suddenly takes 3-4x as many spells to kill a single mob. Needing several mana potions to kill 1 orc is not my idea of fun.","August 2, 2015","false","0.1"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

I tried a fix specifically for this issue with no luck. If it wasn't for the choppy framerate, this wouldn't bother me so much.\n\nAs for the game game itself, the controls are sooo weird... Moving the camera around is painful, and it seems way too easy to bump into stuff and get stuck. The character movement just seems slow and clunky.\n\nI can't really say this is just a cheap knock-off of Morrowind without actually being able to play it properly, but I think I will just stick with Morrowind.

Its defintatly not Oblivion or even close to the quality of Oblivion.  And, unless I am missing something major in the configuration, this game is very awkward to play on a computer.  The mouse look around is extremely sluggish and I cant find a mouse speed setting anywhere in the game.  Trying to fight in this game is terribly awkward as well.  To swing a sword, you must also push a directional button-so you swing and run the direction of your swing, both at the same time, constantly over running your opponent and the extremely sluggish mouse look around makes it take forever to turn back around to face your opponent.  Meanwhile you are getting butchered.  The voice acting is really bad too and I wont comment on the poor, blocky graphics because the game is quite old so that is to be expected.  I have been considering purchasing this game for a very long time(ever since I read the first review that compared it to Oblivion).  Now I am happy that I waited for it to go on sale for only a couple of dollars.  I might have loved this game in my early gaming days when my expectations were much lower but these days I find myself not impressed by it at all.  Of course there are going to be a ton of fan boys and old school snobs who are going to freak out over my review but thats par for the course.  Having said all that, I enjoy older games as much as anyone.  If the controls were a little more PC friendly, I could put up with the bad voice acting, outdated graphics, and simplistic good and evil story line.  But the controls are NOT PC friendly.  The only mouse support is a VERY sluggish look around.  Mouse isnt even supported in the main menu or your inventory(you have to use arrow keys to select items).  If you dont mind a lot of hand work in your games and a frustrating combat/movement system then I guess go for it.  Otherwise, dont bother.","December 22, 2014","false","0.5"," 2 of 13 people (15%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","15","2","13","2","4"

Obvious problems like outdated technology and the somewhat weird controls aside, the game mostly suffers from the horrible writing, bad pacing and ultimately failing to be remotely exciting. While plot and characters may not be that relevant in an action game, I do expect at least some effort put into my CRPGs.\n\nGothic II's story is a fine mess, you hardly know what is going on or why you would even care, it is pretty much stupid for the most part - whenever you get rid of one "problem", a bigger, nastier (or more tiresome) "quest" awaits. Thus any coherence the game might have had gets chopped up into small segments, the open world-nature of the game further dilluting what little there is (from what I understand they basically squeezed the "missiondisk" right into the narrative of the maingame, further proving my point).\n\nUsually it means finding X of something or slaying X of something. Which might be okay, if the game would pull it off to make these tasks exciting - but it simply doesn't. There is massive lack of "stageing", even the most dramatic battles feel lackluster. The "boss"-battles are a complete joke, both extremely unsatisfying as well as unimpressive - no dramatic entrances, no cinematics, no particular tactics that differ vastly from the average fight - nothing.\n\nHalf-way through Chapter II I was going to quit - because there is plenty of backtracking involved as well and long hours of searching without really knowing what you are looking for. Particularly frustrating when the Questlog isn't quite clear, you simply get stuck looking for the needle in a haystack. Just in time the game presented sort-of fast travel which eased some of the pain I had, and helped me pull through to the end (though I had to check guides and walkthroughs more often than I wanted to, because the game can be more than obvious in one moment, just to leave you almost entirely in the dark a few quests later on). I kept going, because I was hoping the game would finally step it up and become interesting, which sadly never happened.\n\nNot everything is crap though, the seamless open-world was impressive - there are almost no loading screens and the atmosphere outside of the terrible "nameless hero thwarts the superevil"-plot was fine too. The foundation for an amazing, timeless game is absolutely here, they just failed to fill the world with something meaningful. Gameplay-wise, it is a challenge for sure, you can get hopelessly lost and overwhelmed as Gothic II walks the fine line between oldschool-hardcore and semi-userfriendly interface - there is a LOT of stuff you can pickup and there are even MORE mistakes you can make along the way. All that for what, though? Ultimately, I just did not feel Gothic II, it wasn't a rewarding experience for me - too much filler, too little genuinely good stuff and even less really memorable things. It might have been a great game at some point in time, but pouring some 30 hours into this nowadays just isn't worth it in my honest opinion.","January 11, 2014","false","24.5"," 6 of 68 people (9%) found this review helpful","9","6","68","0","0"

Well, not really, more like ~I'm a lonely deity, thus I shall create another deity which I shall call my brother.~ ♥♥♥♥ turned out horribly wrong for Innos as his sibiling, Beliar, proved to be his fatalistic counterpart for eternity. Though, he created Adanos, the water god of balance to govern over the newly created land of Man and Beast, where none of the warring brothers were allowed to enter.\n\nThat would be just a small excerpt of the sermon held by Vatras in the temple square of Khorinis. YES, KHORINIS! You have been saved from the deadly(and caved in) clutches of the Sleeper's Temple and are now in Xardas' Tower.\n\n\nLadies and gentlegeeks, I present thee Gothic II (Night of the Raven)! ! We have destroyed the magical wall which imprisoned us, and many other, in the penal Colony of Khorinis. With the last strike against the arch-demon, the Sleeper(known to the orcs as Krushak), you have destroyed that which held the barrier in place. Though, as the arch-demon fought his banishment from this world, he made sure that his last roar would be heard by all servants of Beliar.\n\n"His last order was 'COME!' and they came, all of them, even the dragons."\n\nI remember the time when I was talking to a neighbour about his trek to the Valley of Mines. I was boiling with envy, since I didn't have the game at that time. But when I got my hands on it...oh sweet Rhobar...I've dreamed of you for so long<3 <3 <3\n\nTHIS was the feeling that enveloped me all those years that I played Gothic 1 and stared at what was beyond the barrier. Now, not only that I will have the chance to join the MIlitia of Khorinis and be promoted to the rank of Knight (Paladin) but I will also get the chance to fight by Lee's side once more or take my vows and live as a Fire Magician(priest of Innos).\nI will also get the chance to talk to Raven, the former Ore Baron from the first game, about his newfound hobby of desecrating ancient temples of Adanos.\n\nI'm going to end this little conffesion of mine with a small advice: play it!

The graphics look outdated by modern standards, but that shouldn't put anyone off.\n\nHowever, there is a downside - there are alot of bugs I encountered, such as the game crashing when i pressed escape too much or it not saving properly. But the fact that I kept playing even with these proves just how good it is.\n\nAnother downside is the fact that this game set the bar too high, all newer gothic games just don't compare.","December 10, 2010","true","242.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Attention to detail makes the world feel real and it has a truly unique taste to it.\nIf you have a bit of that old-school backbone when it comes to games that don't make themselves too easy, you'll definitely get quite a lot of value from this game.

I can't say it's the best thing to ever come out because there are a lot of games currently out that are just simply better. What I can argue is that Gothic 2 is still entertaining and if it comes on sale again like it did (I bought it in a bundle wit all the Gothic games December 2013 getting a great steam sale deal.) It would definitely be worth picking up. The game is of a free roam style but still nothing like The Elder Scrolls and doesn't seem to have anywhere near the amount of content that The Elder Scrolls have nor does it have the same amount of exploration for you to do. What it does have are pain in the ♥♥♥ npcs that will 1 shot you on sight that you will have to learn to avoid until you reach a higher level and gear up in order to get any fun out of this game. Gothic 2 can be unforgiving and frustrating so I wouldn't recomend it if you're the kind of person who cusses out other players on Call of Duty, hurls controllers across the room on a frequent basis or makes death threats when he/she is angry. It also suffers from the occasional drastic frame rate drop (Which are limited to specific areas from what I could see 2 different spots are like this) or freeze which may require you to restart your comuter because you will not be able to get into the menu to quit the game. Overall despite it's flaws I still enjoyed it and i'm still having fun with it. So to sum it all up I guess i'd say 5.5/10 better than average far from perfection but a very enjoyable game.","December 20, 2013","true","27.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Again, your first duty is climbing the social ladder and becoming somebody, before you can do more than run when a foe shows up.

As any good sequel should, Gothic 2 improves upon the original and adds even more.\n\nThe Gothic series is known for an immersive open-world atmosphere, unforgiving combat, and interesting characters; Gothic 2 has all of this in spades. In addition, this game adds some crafting elements (notably alchemy and runes/spells, with a little smithing thrown in) that were glaringly missing from the original. The world is roughly 3 times larger than the first (4 times including the content added by Night of the Raven) and is full of little nooks containing treasures, traps and monsters to satisfy your itch to explore.\n\nThe game takes place shortly after the events of the first title and involves many of the original characters (and some familiar places). I highly recommend playing the original Gothic first, because it'll make the sequel that much more enjoyable when you encounter them.\n\nWhether you're leveling up stats/skills or interacting with an NPC, you'll often have to make decisions that will impact the rest of the game. Character progression is slow but rewarding, though you'll feel like there's not enough skill points to go around. This is intentional so that you're encouraged to focus on a particular style of play and is further emphasized by how the game handles factions. If in doubt, take some time to consider those decisions (or at least save in an alternate slot).\n\nWhile Gothic 2 is an amazing title, it's not perfect. I recall a quest involving Lares and Vatras that was very buggy and could potentially ruin your story progression entirely. The bosses are challenging, but are pretty much identical. Diego (a main character from the first game) is mostly an annoying and generic NPC this time around and was voiced by someone else. Being an older game, it's often a hassle to get running on modern PCs (there are guides that help most people) and even then is prone to crashing at the end of several cutscenes (skipping them seems to work, though you'll have to view them elsewhere). Thankfully, Gothic 2 is still very much worth playing despite these flaws.","June 11, 2015","true","155.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It fixes some potentially gamebreaking bugs. If the game gives you the "Access Violation" message, try running the game (gothic2.exe) as admin in the compatibility settings, this solved the problem for me.\n\n[TL:DR] Good game, nice story and world, wonky combat, great atmosphere.\n\nFull ReviewThe story and characters are interesting enough, and the lore is quite fun to delve into. Your actions have consequences, which I like. The atmosphere and world building is where the game shines. The weakness of your character is annoying at times, but at the same time it makes you slow down and really take in the world around you. In a game like Skyrim I never really felt like I was a part of the world, more like a strange alien creature for whom normal people were completely irrelevant. In Gothic 2 you get much more involved in the dealings of normal people, from farmers to merchants, and what you do to or with them actually matters, because you are one of them. It's really good. It actually feels kind of like you are a part of the world, a small person who rises up to glory through hard work and courage.\n\nThe game? It's good, weird, but good. If you're new to the series I can't stress enough how important it is to take it slow and get used to the game. It's a bit clunky (especially the combat) and somewhat opaque when it comes to telling the player what they're supposed to do. Now, this isn't necessarily a bad thing in itself (as the numerous of elitist forum posters have pointed out), but when the map you have is basically just a picture with no named locations on it navigating can seem, and sometimes is, unnecessarily cumbersome. A feature to write notes on the map would be appreciated. A character might say "Go to Onar's farm, it's to the east", that's all you've got to go on. The map has some farm looking drawings on it, so it should be one of them.\n\nThis would all be completely fine if not for how unbelievably weak you character is in the beginning. This game rewards exploration, but i doesn't at the same time. Sometimes your treks can be just fine, but then if you walk to the north instead of east you will die, because an orc decided to camp out here. He sees you, draws his sword and kills you in one quick slash. The best way to find out where you can and cannot go is simply to save the game, pick a road and see how far you can go before getting killed. It's weird, but you get used to it. After a while you will get stronger, while it's still dangerous to face off against a bigger group of enemies, you're not as squishy as you were before.\n\nMy biggest gripe with the game is the combat, or how they decided to design some of it. When you draw your sword your character will automatically lock on to the nearest person/monster/giant bug, no matter who or what it is. Fighting with a companion. for example, is horrible; your character will constantly lock on to your companion instead of the enemy and you end up fighting the mechanics more than the actual enemy. It should also be noted that this feature is on by default and cannot be turned off. Fighting groups of enemies is even more janky, and the lock-on is still the villain. This means that, since enemies don't just stand and wait for their turn, you will constantly change focus from enemy to enemy, with the camera darting around desperately trying to keep up. It makes the fights infuriatingly confusing, a simple feature to just lock on to a single enemy and keep it locked would be so much better, or no lock on feature at all, honestly.\n\nAll in all, a good game filled to the brim with ambition and ideas and perhaps too small a budget. If you like rpgs and have the patience to learn how the mechanics work I wholeheartedly recommend this.","August 7, 2015","true","67.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is one of those cases.\n\nBefore I get started, allow me to state that this game has an extremely unforgiving early game that neither of the titles in the paragraph above hold a candle to in terms of difficulty. It is unforgiving and you will die. You will die a lot. You will die so many times, actually, that you just stop getting mad all together. Of course, part of the charm in the classic RPGs is the difficulty, and Gothic II certainly doesn't skim on that. It is as deep, complex, and difficult as even any RPG out there.\n\nThe architecture and design is clearly inspired by medevil Germany, especially the houses and buildings and whatnot, which are almost spot on for not only that time period but in some cases, modern German architecture. I found that to be pretty fun, admittedly. It really goes great with Sour Cream & Onion flavored potato chips. There are a lot of quest and all of the dialogue is voiced, and while the voice acting can be a bit laughable at times the dialogue itself is really great. Keep in mind this game was ported to the English language, and voice acting in ports is usually not very great. This time it was just us English speakers catching the short end of the stick for once, because I hear the voice acting in the original language is pretty dope. The direct dialogue itself is still pretty amazing, though. Very immerse dialogue in conversations that involve your character and you pick which way the conversations lead and whatnot, so I find that to be pretty fun.\n\nThere are some minor issues with the combat system, admittedly. It'll seem a bit clunky at first, but once you get used to it there isn't going to be much of a problem with that. It won't be why you're dying, at least. Which you will die, by the way. Don't know if I mentioned that yet.\n\nThe graphics are about on par for the time it was released, which it was originally released in 2002, so they shouldn't be too much of an issue unless you walk in with unrealistic expectations. Some areas they are lacking and some areas they're exceeding the expectations set. I don't really care much about that, however, as the strength in Gothic II is the quests, the dialogue, and the gritty realism. This isn't like Elder Scrolls where people welcome you with open arms. You're not wanted anywhere, and most people will treat you like absolute ♥♥♥♥. There is little helping each other out and personal gain is always going to be a motive with every quest you take and every conversation you make. And people standing outside of taverns in the harbor district will try to take a lot of money from you with threats. And they will kill you, and you will die.\n\nIf you have troubles running it, which many people will due to the poor future-proofing, just follow this guide:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=353800674\n\nThis game is totally worth full price and I recommend it to any RPG fan out there. Wonderful, wonderful game :3\n\nYou will die, though.","March 9, 2015","true","25.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game does take a while to pick up, but once it does you start to get immersed in the world of Gothic. If you do truly have a problem with the graphics, they can be fixed with more 'up to date' textures I'm sure anyone can find online. Only problem I can point out with the game is its control system, as its not explained clearly how to attack or draw wepon etc, so I would reccomend watching some playthroughs and looking at the manual before diving in as I did.","June 23, 2015","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To me its much better than gothic 3 and always will be.....THAT IS IF THIS ♥♥♥♥ COULD RUN ON MODERN FULLSCREEN MONITORS - -!!! you guys have no idea the trouble i had to make it work with fullscreen. i had to downgrade from version 2.7 to the broken 2.6 and that ♥♥♥♥ wasnt easy to do and HOW could i even downgrade it to 2.6 proved to be a HUGE pain. Apparently only the current version of 2.6 works with fullscreen on 16:9/16:10 monitors and you gotta tweak it yourself which ALSO proved to be a big pain in the ♥♥♥♥ and after downgrading it, i had to download a patch that could be compatible to fullscreen 2.6 version. DONT buy the game, unless you have a 4:3 monitor and if you are a big fan of the gothic series. This will never get modern fullscreen monitor support from the devs but its possible to make it work if you look up on the net.

I dived into it with a passion not many games were able to spark in me over the course of the years. It's a shame that this game didn't quite get the popularity in the US as it should've deserved, in my opinion.\nThis game is the continuation of Gothic 1 and its story with the same badass hero and his badass friends. The story and character development in this game is amazing and compared to other games that came around at the same time as Gothic 2 it is fair to say that it held its ground with shining excellence. The addon"The Night of the Raven" expands the game almost twofold and gives an entirely new experience on top of the already fantastic vanilla version.\nI have to admit that tastes are different. Morrowind was a great game, but for my own tastes Gothic 2 Notr just has an undescribable edge. Should you buy it? Definitely! This game is 1,99€ on sale right now, what the hell are you waiting for?! (oh no, now I've got this catchy tune in my head)","January 3","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What a master piece. Finally I got the steam version up and running, here I go again Khorinis!!!\n\nSadly I still keep on seen reviews complaining about the graphics, really? Apparently many gamers is all they care about, graphics; even if the game itself is a piece of crap or a senseless empty shell. I don’t know about the other fans but even the rustic graphics on Gothic 2 were just perfect for the environment in the game. A good example, what happened with gothic 3? Boy! What a rip off, I paid 50 dollars back then and I think I still regret it. What was the point on improving the graphics? Game all full of glitches, lost most of its essence it didn’t even feel like gothic anymore, it was a completely different game, not mentioning the brutally high specs for the time. That proves my point, yeah nice graphics 8/10 but 2/10 about the game itself, if I wanted to play and kill stuff for no reason in a beautiful landscape I would have played Halo on instead.\n\nAt least for me a good game is the one that catches your attention completely, makes you feel it, gets you involved, and Gothic 1 and 2 are a great example of it, actually this game helped me define my path as a gamer, since Gothic 2 I became a big fan of role playing games.\n\nHighly recommended game 29.5 / 10 indeed ;)  LONG LIFE TO GOTHIC 2 AND THE NAMELESS HERO!!!!\n\n","March 20","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story, the voiceacting, the melee fighting mechanics, the vast and diverse world is one of a kind. Gothic 1 should be played before this game, so you wont have trouble understanding the story ( and gothic 1 is fantastic game as well ).\n\nPros\n- This game is a true open-world rpg. You can visit the vast majority of places in the world without story developing into those regions\n- The melee fighting mechanic is very well constructed. The combos are really fun execute. The AI meelefighters are also masterfully done. You will understand in a very short time, that you are facing a true blademaster. The parries, dodges and combos the enemies can do makes the fighting experience something beyond many rpg games i have played.\n- The magic in the game is diverse. Healing, summoning, teleportation, elemental, status effect you have everything in this game. The AI mages usually use low level spells, but sometimes you encounter your usual enemy mage casting one the strongest fire spells if you allow him to execute the spell in time.\n- The story is fantastic. Very well written, very well coordinated through npcs, augmented with side-quests helping you get through the main story.\n- The side quest are what makes this game on the best in its time.\n- The voice acting is fantastic ( especially the german)\n- The integration of the gothic 1 characters is smoothly done. They fit right in where you will find them here in gothic 2\n- The world is wonderfully constructed, each new region has a center plaza to rotate easily between places of importance. Different terrain in nearly all the new places you encounter. Vast number of monsters. Huge number of npcs. The npcs with no names ( eg. a novice) has speech option, where he or she will give a different responses to the different events happening in the world of khorinis at that time\n- Replayable through different faction selections.\n- Fantastic world and boss music\n\nCons\n- Minor logic mistake with npc equipments\n- Playing as a mage in add-on is very hard. This is very sad, because some of the add-on introduced spells are very fun to use ( the normal G2 mage is still fine)\n- Some of the boss battles are not working properly, the patterns leave open a lot of abuses for archers and mages to exploit.\n- There are still some bugs for unlimited gold if you have the time to do it multiple times. ( nothing gamebreaking )\n\nOverall i give this game a 10/10\nOne of the best rpg ever made, the best open-world rpg in my opinion and it should on every top x rpg list for the next 50+ years . And yes i love this game ..\nDont let my 30 hours played mislead you i have played this game at least 20 times","March 12","true","72.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What a master piece. Finally I got the steam version up and running, here I go again Khorinis!!!\n\nSadly I still keep on seen reviews complaining about the graphics, really? Apparently many gamers is all they care about, graphics; even if the game itself is a piece of crap or a senseless empty shell. I don’t know about the other fans but even the rustic graphics on Gothic 2 were just perfect for the environment in the game. A good example, what happened with gothic 3? Boy! What a rip off, I paid 50 dollars back then and I think I still regret it. What was the point on improving the graphics? Game all full of glitches, lost most of its essence it didn’t even feel like gothic anymore, it was a completely different game, not mentioning the brutally high specs for the time. That proves my point, yeah nice graphics 8/10 but 2/10 about the game itself, if I wanted to play and kill stuff for no reason in a beautiful landscape I would have played Halo on instead.\n\nAt least for me a good game is the one that catches your attention completely, makes you feel it, gets you involved, and Gothic 1 and 2 are a great example of it, actually this game helped me define my path as a gamer, since Gothic 2 I became a big fan of role playing games.\n\nHighly recommended game 29.5 / 10 indeed ;)  LONG LIFE TO GOTHIC 2 AND THE NAMELESS HERO!!!!\n\n","March 20","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You'll start off a little frustrated at the fact your guy can be killed by rats, and the combat controls, which require use of the keyboard to attack forward, left, right and dodge.  Besides that, this is the first game I played that requires you to actually go to different trainers and use your gold/XP to upgrade. There is no other way. This is my second purchase of this game, and I can tell you that all the worl you put into your character actually makes you proud of your accomplishments from the first troll you slay to the last dragon. Unlike most RPGs, by the end you'll feel like you've actually transformed your character to something epic. Obviously old now, when it came out in 2002 (US version came out in 03) it was the most in depth and expensive game to come out besides morrowind. For a challenge, and a different Role playing game, try this.","September 30, 2011","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As any good sequel should, Gothic 2 improves upon the original and adds even more.\n\nThe Gothic series is known for an immersive open-world atmosphere, unforgiving combat, and interesting characters; Gothic 2 has all of this in spades. In addition, this game adds some crafting elements (notably alchemy and runes/spells, with a little smithing thrown in) that were glaringly missing from the original. The world is roughly 3 times larger than the first (4 times including the content added by Night of the Raven) and is full of little nooks containing treasures, traps and monsters to satisfy your itch to explore.\n\nThe game takes place shortly after the events of the first title and involves many of the original characters (and some familiar places). I highly recommend playing the original Gothic first, because it'll make the sequel that much more enjoyable when you encounter them.\n\nWhether you're leveling up stats/skills or interacting with an NPC, you'll often have to make decisions that will impact the rest of the game. Character progression is slow but rewarding, though you'll feel like there's not enough skill points to go around. This is intentional so that you're encouraged to focus on a particular style of play and is further emphasized by how the game handles factions. If in doubt, take some time to consider those decisions (or at least save in an alternate slot).\n\nWhile Gothic 2 is an amazing title, it's not perfect. I recall a quest involving Lares and Vatras that was very buggy and could potentially ruin your story progression entirely. The bosses are challenging, but are pretty much identical. Diego (a main character from the first game) is mostly an annoying and generic NPC this time around and was voiced by someone else. Being an older game, it's often a hassle to get running on modern PCs (there are guides that help most people) and even then is prone to crashing at the end of several cutscenes (skipping them seems to work, though you'll have to view them elsewhere). Thankfully, Gothic 2 is still very much worth playing despite these flaws.","June 11, 2015","true","155.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
