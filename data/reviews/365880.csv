However I can't recommend this  game for a number of reasons.\n\nIt is common for games to be split into chapters so we don't expect the story to be completed. . With  achievements for completing chapters for this it appears to have more content. In reality this doesn't have enough content to justify it as a chapter. It feels more like a demo or an introduction.\n\nIt's nice to have an interactive 3D environment and the artwork is a good standard. Unfortunately as the whole game is set in an office there is no  variety. When you combine a right item you complete a chapter, get a cut scene and you are back in the office again. You have to use and combine all the necessary items to finish the game but only certain items will trigger another chapter.\n\nThe inventory menu could also have had a clearer, simpler layout having to swap between sections clunky. It would not be immediately clear for everyone where to combine items due to the dark colours and small buttons . Furthermore this may be a problem for people with poor eyesight.\n\nAll the achievements are easy to obtain but the "Thinker" achievement, clicking on all the items, can be tricky to pop up. For a perfect game you may need to do  a second play through which isn't too much hassle for a short game.\n\nThe story. about Rob trying to find out what happened to his twin brother, has hints through notes and cut scenes that show potential to be interesting. If this had more going for it this might of been a recommend. I am a little curious about what happens next but I can't recommend this game series as it stands at the time of writing.\n","December 19, 2015","false","5.4"," 51 of 58 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","51","58","0","2"

Apparently he is chased and needs to secure an item from these people. So you head to his office and try to find whatever he is hiding first.\n\nThe puzzles in the game aren't that hard, but there were 2 where i struggled a bit.\nAtmosphere is pretty good and the story seems pretty interesting. although you don't get to know much. It's basically just some emails and notes which gives you hints of the broader story.\n\nGame ends on a big cliffhanger, so hopefully there will be more chapters soon.\n\nI enjoyed it and would recommend to everyone who likes these first-person puzzle-games and is not put off by the fact that the game is quite short.","November 29, 2015","true","3.3"," 32 of 33 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","32","33","0","2"

The overall atmosphere is suspensefull which is nicely enhanced by the music and the sound of for instance the rain and the voices.\nOften I try a new game and find out after about half an hour that I won't be liking it for sure. Well, this one's the opposite: I am really drawn into the story of a twin brother trying to find out what is happening to his 'other half' .\nSo, once I finish this first chapter I will write an update, for now I recommend this to anyone who likes point and click adventures.","December 29, 2015","true","2.8"," 25 of 30 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","25","30","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/365880/","vicrabb","Vic=HKC=","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/","1791 products in account","Your twin brother seems in trouble, so, you head for his office to find an hidden mask. It's the night, it's raining and you're nearly in the dark. What will you find?\n\nAs Mirrored is an episodic game, for now, Chapter 1 is only released. It serves as a teasing given the ending. I can't say anything about the plot: that first taste is generating questions and I would like to see how chapter 2 will answer (or not) these.\n\nIt's a point & click game: you look around, you read descriptions about objects, you combine some in your inventory, you use others where it seems to be appropriate and you solve some puzzles. I've just a little complaint to make: the inventory isn't really practical. You need to open it and let it open if you want to use an object around. I'm so used to have the object outside the inventory that I was kinda lost.\n\nAlso, I must say that I was already asking myself for 10 minutes about what to do. It was clear that the darkness in the office played a lot in that as I didn't see the only element left and that would be useful for the rest. I would have preferred to use already the flashlight: only the desk lamp was open and wasn't sufficient for the room.\n\nThe puzzles, given the fact that they're in English, could be hard for those not speaking it. I couldn't really have found the password for the laptop because despite seeing the hint, I didn't find really the answer. I had some parts of it in the head but the first sentence wasn't clear for me. Another puzzle was finding the code for the safe. It's not really easy to tie it to clues you found. Perhaps a little more subtle guidance could be imagined?\n\nThe graphics are good, though you see only the office during the chapter. However, the cutscenes are drawned I must say that the style is enough for the game. It's reminding me of another game, Return:Null, that I'm waiting the third chapter to really review it.\n\nThe soundtrack is also good, though limited as you don't really spend a hour to finish the game (and if it takes more, it means either that you were really stuck or that you paused and did something else or that you were idling cards, like I'm currently doing while writing this review).\n\nBecause Mirrored - Chapter 1 is short. Very short. Just a tease so that you have to buy the rest if you want to know the ending of the whole arc. True, I'm used to episodic formats - Space Pilgrim, Return:Null, Blues and Bullets, The Walking Dead (both seasons), The Wolf Is Among Us, Tales from the Borderlands... - but it's the first time that I felt a little cheated. Each episode of the games I've mentionned were more consistants than staying in an office and clicking everywhere - you're not even walking, you're turning around on the same spot. I'm probably not seeing Mirrored as a "complete" chapter, more like a prologue or a teasing.\n\nThe price is 3 bucks, so, it may explain the shortness too. It's not really expensive.\n\nIf I recommend Mirrored? Yeah. It's a polished chapter, a neat one, without encountered bugs. But if you don't like staying in the same spot, in an unique room, you should probably avoid it.","February 13","true","2.9"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

It's not like you can go wrong spending an hour messing around in a room trying to figure your way out. I could perhaps argue that a coule of the puzzle elements are too abstract, but that might just be me missing something that should make it obvious. Only other negative thing I could possibly say is that there are a couple of dodgy puns in there. It's also worth noting that there is a nice system that lets you only do things the character is aware of, so you can't just click on stuff until things happen.\n\nIn summery. It's fun. Musics nice.

The problem I have is with the mouse movenent.  When you move a mouse, depending on your preference, you either move the point you are looking at, or you move the world around you.  Those are opposite directions.  There is a button to invert the mouse in the settings but the problem is either way,  movement is a mixture of moving the world in one axis and moving where I'm looking in the other axis.  As an example of what I'm talking about, if I move the mouse left to look left, that works.  But if I move the mouse UP to look up, my view point moves down.  I will never be able to get used to that.\n\nPlease add separate buttons for inverting X and Y axis independently.\n\nFor now, I'll vote 'Yes', assuming this will be fixed.\n\nThanks!","November 14, 2015","true","0.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

Controls are clunky, and without instruction, it's tough to figure out how to make things work together. On top of all this, some segements go by in 30 seconds, and others take 15 minutes, weird pacing. Lastly, the music looping is really annoying and made me want to look up the solution just so I wouldn't have to hear that segments music anymore. If you like puzzles, the game will go by way too quickly for the price.","February 13","false","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I played it over 10 hours and it give me more satisfaction than the many other puzzle/adventure. Here some Pros and cons.\n\nPros\n-Well desinged game with right mood and art style.\n-Difficulty level is, as it should be; not too easy or to hard to be frustrating.\n-Story is interesting enough to make you wonder, and foreshadowing is well balanced to keep mystery.\n\nCons\n-Well, it should be a little bit longer,but whick game should'nt be\n-Maybe Soundtrack can be litttle more long, after a while listening to same track get a bit boring.\n\nSo, in general Mirrored is very good puzzle/adventure game with a good price tag. With a price of a cup of coffee, you get a many hour worth of play puzzle game. I advise you to give a shot.","November 25, 2015","true","11.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The narrative is weirdly divided in acts and sub-acts, some of them consisting of just one puzzle! What *is* there is pleasant enough, graphics, writing and cutscenes included, although I'm not completely sold on the interface, which I found clunky and impractical. In all, a nice diversion for a couple of hours.\n","April 8","true","4.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While there is some promise to it, it doesn't even play like an opening chapter to a game so much as a prologue.  It's very short, there's not a lot of story there, and there aren't a lot of puzzles.  And one or two of the ones that do exist end up being obscure logic jumps that don't really work, which are paired with everything else being overly simplistic.  Also, one of the achievements is apparently broken.  I've played through the game twice very deliberately, one time even following a guide, and still the glitched Thorough achievemnt would not pop.\n\nI'm fine with having paid a few bucks to support some devs finding their feet, but they really need to concentrate on refining this into a better, more complex, and less buggy experience if they continue to move foward with this project and future installments.  4/10 for me, and a point or two of that is for the game's potential.","December 18, 2015","false","1.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I don't like the execution though for several reasons:\n\n- Some parts were too hard to solve, such as the overly cryptic password hint on the computer.\n- The interface is awkward; the GUI for the items and journals could be improved to make using/combining items easier.\n- The inventory quickly becomes overcrowded; the game should just discard of e.g. used keys.\n- At first, the room is very dark, and I had to turn off my lights to even see the room clearly. Which in itself is not really problematic, if not for each time I click something, a VERY BRIGHT line of text appears. My eyes are tired after playing just this one short chapter now.\n- The game is very short, even considering the price, with no conclusion in sight.\n\nSure, the developers want to construct several chapters and combine them into one game, but now they're selling 10% of an unfinished game for much more than 10% of the price that the total game would be worth. I'm going to pass on the next chapters, and if you haven't bought this chapter yet, I recommend you skip this chapter as well.","March 4","false","1.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I like escape-the-room games. But this one went just wrong.\nFirst of all, the game is really dark and pixel hunting all those barely visible items was not fun at all. There is a torch to be found but guess what - it's also hidden in the dark so it took me the whole first chapter before I discovered it.\nThen there's the password puzzle. You are supposed to guess a laptop password but the clues are so vague they could mean virtually anything. After 20 minutes of clueless staring at the screen I checked a walkthrough and I'm sure I would have never figured that out. Thankfully the safe puzzle is a lot better.\nAnd third, the transitions between chapters make no sense. There are no goals, the game never tells you anything yet it expects you to do a specific set of unrelated actions to move on. So instead of solving a puzzle you desperately click on everything trying to figure out what on earth you are supposed to do.\n\nThe game feels more like a tech demo. It's very short, unpolished and the story didn't answer a single question. This is weak even for two euros.","March 7","false","1.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I spent 2 hours in that part and 1 hour in the rest of the game. I eventualy had to go read an walkthrough but even then i was thinking to myself that it was nonsense. From there the game lost my atention and curiosity.\n\nI hate it when the game doesn't give the player enough information about something he's supposed to do. There are no puzzles, it's just get something then use it on something. Also, i hate it when the game doesn't let you do something before you're supposed to (ex: Find something that was there the whole time but you can only interact with it now).\n\nWouldn't recommend.\n","March 25","false","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
