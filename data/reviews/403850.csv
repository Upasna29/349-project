But after one single stage my ship got damaged, and I had to wait 20 MINUTES for life regen!!! Or pay 1 crystal (which I didn't have) for quick regen. Great game: play 2 minutes, wait 20 for another round!\n\nAnd you also can't select/confirm options with the controller. I'm using Xbox 360 controller and I got to use mouse to click on boxes that appear in game. The controller only serves to maneuver the ship left and right while you're "racing".\n\n\nDont buy it, untill they port it correctly.","March 25","false","1.6"," 81 of 88 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","81","88","0","1"

It’s a running game set in a steampunk universe, and while it’s in Early Access I feel the game has shown its original roots and developer intentions.\n\nReview - https://youtu.be/7j0p_KE1aVU\n\nI’ll address the elephant in the room; yes it’s a mobile port. This is shown through the use of a premium currency and though it is obtainable in game it is extremely slow. Also the premium currency ships and crew members are superior to the ‘f2p’ options in every single way. It bares its ugly teeth when you have to wait 20 MINUTES! for a ship to recover its HP after a mission, but don’t worry, with some premium currency we’ll have ‘er up and runnin’ in no time!\n\nUsual runner stuff applies, go through a level, pick up coins, dodge terrain and enemies, and use premium currency to give yourself a boost for that level. Unlike most running games though the controls are slow and stiff, and there is no feeling of speed. Your control options are either left or right and the use of an ‘active’ ability, this is less than your usual smart phone runner. Also the sense of difficulty is non-existent due to the slow gameplay and if you run into any difficulty it’s due to the limitation of the controls and generally poorly designed enemies, but if you do struggle you can spend that good ol’ premium currency and revive yourself!\n\nSky To Fly: Faster Than Wind is an example of a game that is extremely flawed for the PC space. While it may boasts great graphics and story mode for a smart phone game, this is the PC and the standards are different. The laziness shown through the keeping of premium currency and all the ‘features’ it entails is just something you can’t ignore, and turns something that could be a somewhat enjoyable experience sour.\n\nEdit: The game is now fully released and none of the issues have been addressed. The points in the review still hold true.","February 5","false","6.4"," 92 of 112 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","92","112","3","2"

I don't know where the good views came from. The game feels a bit slow, and yes, I haven't played the game that much.\n\nReview\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VK7Z4SUSBE\n\nMy first thoughts were, this is a mobile port, the big buttons and the settings that you would have on a phone game or flash game. I didn't like it. When you would boot it up, you could select full screen but when you would boot it up the next time, it would go back to windowed mode. That tells me that this is a mobile port.\n\nYou would mostly crash into that object if you are near it, not touching it. You would also collect cogs. MOBILE PORT You have this ingame currency. The action is really tense. NOT. This game just feels like you should play this game on your way to school/work. You also have these anoying timers, to repair you "warship"\n\nAnd there is this annoying 5 second repeated music in the menu screen.\n\nAnd yes, I rate it 0/10 DON'T BUY IT!

It's kind of like a runner except it's mission based as opposed to endless and it has a story, though it's pretty threadbare and also poorly translated.\n\nThe game play is done with only two keys (with a third later on) and largely involves dodging things as you get from place to place to complete story and side missions. You collect two different forms of currency along the way, which can be used to acquire better crew members with different traits, as well as upgrade your ship. It's not complex or difficult in the slightest but it has a very relaxes, zen feel. The art style is superb and conveys the unique world of floating islands very nicely and it's accompanied with very nice, chill music. This isn't a game you play for challenge or a massive sense of accomplishment, it's just relaxing fun.\n\nThis is a game that clearly has free-to-play roots from mobile as some mechanics like timers are still in this (though made so fast, they're utterly pointless) but there are no in-game purchases whatsoever and you're given plenty of currency and can finish the entire 3-4 hour adventure in one sitting if you want. Many formerly free-to-play mobile games that port to PC either leave the microtransactions in or jack up the price to an absurd level to avoid them. Sky to Fly only costs $4 and has no microtransactions. For me, the experience was an absolute steal at that price.\n\nIf you want something challenging or "hardcore", you're not going to find that with Sky to Fly but as someone who does love hardcore games, this was a nice little diversion when I just wanted to check out and chill for a while. You can't go wrong for the price in my opinion.","April 7","true","2.7"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sirgalahad/recommended/403850/","sirgalahad","A train","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sirgalahad/","90 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI deleted my original review, after a long read through it I felt immature myself.  Yet I found a lot of it very true, and after investigating a lot of it I decided I should re do it.  My original thoughts remain; the game itself is appaulingly bad for a game you have to pay for.  But here I want to focus more on something else than the actual game; what it originally was.\n\nBut first review about what it currently is, and isn't\nWhat it is:\nA "Runner" game that's currently free on the Google Play Marketplace.  Here's the link so you don't waste money on this version and can try it out on an emulator such as bluestacks.  Personally I dislike the publisher so I'd do it.\nGame: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.absolutist.skytoflyfree&hl=en\nBluestacks Android Emulator: http://www.bluestacks.com/\nWhat it isn't / What it lacks\n- It isn't a good looking game\n- It doesn't have a good options menu\n- There's a lack of decent storytelling (All text, all in weird prompts)\n- There's a constant tutorial going on rather than the "experimentation" way of teaching the player.\n- It isn't a "Sports", "Simulation", or really a "Early Access" game.  I feel like they're using Early Access as a shield, though if you read their description they're supposed to be done in less then a month from now, though their models are in poor detail and lacking polish as a game.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTo the Publisher\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDearest Absolutist Ltd.\nWhy was your responce to my admitedly childish original review in itself more childish, and less professional as a company.  Why have you TWICE now used innapropriote tags to advertise your game?  Why are you promoting a sequel to a game in a pre finished state?  That's worse than Ubisoft releasing multiple ♥♥♥♥ Assassins Creed games within the same year.  Why do you try to hide the fact that your games are Mobile Ports?  And why do you have NO mention of steam on your website?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTo the Developer\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDear AIVIK LLC\nWhere did the Sky To Fly MMORPG game idea go?  I still see your forums active, I played the preview, though I don't know Russian myself so I cannot understand all of it.  And I overall liked the idea.  So why did you seemingly lose track of that, your websites seem out of date after all this time though, why did you take your assets for the MMORPG game, and put them into a "runner" game, with a closer perspective making them look horrible?  I am in no way mad with you as I am the Publisher, I just want answers.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTo the Reader\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf you want to know more about what I am talking about, please follow these links.\nhttp://absolutist.com -- The publishers website, where there's no mention of anything on steam.  And they advertise free games.\nhttp://aivik.ru/index.html -- The developers site, where there's art for Sky To Fly there.  (Most noteworthy being a robot seen in the Sky To Fly: Soulless Leviathan trailer)  All in russian so try using Google Chrome to translate\nAnd most interesting of all:\nhttp://sky2fly.ru/ -- Sky To Fly's website.  With a forum, documentation and the actial MMORPG (All in russian again) with more concept art and a free demo with a promising show to put on, if it were in English I'd actually give it a try.  I did try it even in russian though.\nSo investigate a little.  You'll see the Android version seems to have some of the content in both Faster than Wind and Soulless Leviathan possilby meaning that they've been chopping the Android version up into 3 games of the same type, and with the smallest being 4 dollars I only imagine them upping the price.  But if all three are 4 dollars you're spending a maximum of 12 dollars on a game with assets as far back as 2010, thats free to play on Android.  Just think about these anti consumer practices at play here.  I do plan on doing more investigating, and hopefully make a video on everthing.  Thanks.\n\nAlso here's a little proof that there is asset re use going on here:\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/11cf7618546dcfe2cd8f29539c939bae.jpg\nTechnically it's still theirs to use but it is interesting to say the least.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI decided to keep my original review archived here.  Everything after this point is disconnected from the rest\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPlayed 10 minutes after receiving a key for review and blindly going in.  And I can say without a doubt probably the worse 10 minutes I've spent in my life, doing nothing would be better than playing this game.\nWell perhaps not but lets go into detail.\n\nStory: Might as well be none, in a forced cinematic you literally bump into a airship and theres just a captain and no crew apparently whos like 'oh you're going to this place let me lead you!' and then is like 'my engines broken' and I immedietly stopped giving a ♥♥♥♥.\n\nGraphics: *Satire/sarcasm coming up*\nWOW THEY BLEW ME AWAY SO REALISTIC I WAS SUPRISED MY INTEL INTEGRATED GRAPHICS COULD HANDLE THEM!!!!!!!!!!!  YOU LOOK AT THE TEXTURES AND MODELS AND YOU JUST GAZE IN AWE OF THIS WORLD YOU'VE JUST ENTERED THROUGH YOUR MONITOR, I WISH I HAD A OCCULUS RIFT JUST TO BE IN FIRST PERSON STEERING MY SHIP ACROSS THE BOUNDLESS SKY!!!!!!!!!!!!! BUY GAYME NAO!!!!  *Sarcasm done with*\nIn truth, the game only supports 4:3 resolutions.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=623732748\nI think, and I say I think because there's no resolution option, and the settings screen is pathetic,\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=623732305\ntheres only language sound effects, music, and "HD" and there's two screenshots below showing the differences hd makes, and pro tip; I forgot which one's which.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=623732069\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=623732094\n\nGameplay:  Supports WASD and Arrow keys and is just a floaty ship, nothing else.\n\nPS; Graphics requirements make no sense "Graphics: 512 Mb"  and in more ways than one, not only not referencing a graphics card series or anything of the sorts but using Mb not MB so megabit, not megabyte, and megabit refers to transfer speeds so is it 512 mb/s? for graphics?  That's really odd.\n\nAlso its in genres it shouldn't be in, like Sports, and Simulation, even racing which it might fit in as a minigame but I think either the publisher or developer is abusing steam to put their game in more favorable searches, and perhaps more.  I do think a lot of the positive reviews are odd...\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlso here's the comments from the developer and my responce:\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/66fc74ca8a0e43ad28ec411eee5e3e17.png\n(Taken on March 17th 2016, they made no attempt to counter my rebuttel)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlso my video review for anyone interested\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfa2y1to7VY","March 17","false","1.8"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

Though this version has increased graphical quality over its mobile counterpart. The two main controls are left and right and well thats about it what do you expect.\n\nYou're a pilot for a ship and your goal is to reach the end of the level and by golly there are things in the way! Floating islands, weird animals and the most difficult to get past enemy ships. When completing a level you get a star rating out of 3. This means that anyone who is kind of a completionist like myself will be replaying levels for that 3 star rating. Since your ships goes at about the same pace without powerups or other bonuses found on the map its a little weird having "time" as one of the ratings in the ending screen.\n\nYou can change your ships crew giving you different bonuses which gives a small amount of customisation.\nIf you're a mobile enthusiast, temple run addict or anywhere in between you'll probably like this game. 7/10\n\nSky FTW is pretty neat, steampunk world with some silly characters and for $3.99 you can't really go wrong.","April 21","true","0.3"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

It has that mobile port sort of feel in some places, but overall I recommend playing this game... especially if you enjoy casual gameplay.\n\nSure, the game is not all that difficult to play, nor is it all that expansive, but for an Early Access Game it runs perfectly fine and I think the developer has nailed the price point for a game like this.\n\nI guess if I had some things I would change, it would be the graphic options.

The game takes place in a fantasy world and has a lot to offer than what it costs. https://youtu.be/ot7DQHYXcoY\nPros :\n1) Beautiful graphics & epic levels.\n2) In early access and still has a lot to offer.\n3) Simple control and interface.\n4) Clear and small introduction to everything new on your journey. (I liked the idea very much)\n5) Smooth 60fps gameplay & responsive controls.\n6) Nothing complicated.\n7) Thoughtful and humourour dialogues.\nCons :\n1) Not the best of stories as you would expect.\n2) Adding the slowing down button would have been a better experience but that would hurt the flow of the game of course.\n3) Adding a few more variations and a few more things to do will take the game to a whole new level. Like implementing\nbetter one on one fights with pirates, a boss maybe or something else.","February 22","true","5.3"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","3","12","0","0"
