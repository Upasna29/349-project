Although the fundamental game mechanic requires you to slide tiles to get to the Exit, the layering of other simple mechanics like Teleportation, Magnets that move adjacent tiles, Walls that can be destroyed by Bombs, Freaky Puppets with one touch kill, Tiles having access from only certain sides, and more…. makes solving this game Highly Abstract and your thinking needs to be in at least Four Dimensions. Good luck.\n\nI begin all puzzles by staring at the grid hoping to solve the whole puzzle in my head first; early puzzles require 5-10 moves and this ability is lost after the first 25 puzzles or so. After that a little trial and error helps with setting up later parts of the puzzles requiring 10-25 moves…. This is not unlike Chess. After seven hours, 50 puzzles (approximately one quarter of the game)  I have found no bugs and all the idiosyncrasies of their previous game ‘Rooms: The Main Building’ have been addressed; the out-of-place Hidden Object component has been removed. Hats off  to the Devs for ‘Rooms: The Unsolvable Puzzle’, the perfect second iteration in this Abstract Sliding Tile genre.\n\nEvolution and Elevation of a classic puzzle design in a way that can only be addressed through the digital medium is a rare feat and this is why I purchased this game ‘Rooms: The Unsolvable Puzzle’.\n\nPS: Steam Cards and 100% Achievements are within your grasp [ /warm and fuzzy]","May 13, 2015","true","52.8"," 34 of 36 people (94%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","94","34","36","5","7"

Like, really, really hate them. My friend only bought me this game because she knew how much I hate sliding puzzles.\n\nBut this game is different in that it's not just another sliding puzzle game, it's just a puzzle game that uses sliding as a mechanic. Instead of just trying to put together a picture or allign pipes or something, you control a character that you move throughout the different room tiles, and the game is based around figuring out how to move back and forth through the tiles to get to a door to the next level, with various mechanics like telephones that warp you between same-colored phones and wardrobes that warp the contents of the tile you're in with the contents of the tile with the other wardrobe. It also has pretty nice music. It's not run-out-and-buy-it-right-now good, but it's an interesting little puzzle game that's worth a shot if it's on sale.","June 18, 2015","true","9.9"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","11","13","2","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/331460/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Rooms: The Unsolvable Puzzle is the sequel to one of the smash hit indie games that was released in 2014 on Steam, Rooms: The Main Building which, of course, was available much earlier than that on console. The basic premise of the game is that rooms of a mansion are in a scattered order and it is up to the player to move the rooms around the puzzle board in order to find the solution, It’s not as simple as it sounds as the game introduces tools and tricks that must be utilized to find the solution. The adventure component of the game ties everything together quite nicely with a fantastic little fairy tales-esque type story.  The player controls Anna who is trapped within the mansion and it up to the player to free herself from the mansion.\n\nThe art work, graphics and sound combine to be perfectly suitable for a game of this nature. It fits the theme rather well and accomplishes what the developers had set out to accomplish. You’re not going to be playing a game of this type for the graphics. yet HandMade Games have done a fantastic job in sprucing the graphics up to the point where the game genuinely feels like it is leaps and bounds ahead of the more common and low budget puzzle games that litter Steam. The music is that of a fairy tale.\n\nThe only problem that I came across in the game was while playing with my controller. For whatever reason it simply refused to recognize my right trigger button and the bumper wouldn’t work either. The solution was simple and I utilized my mouse to do the same thing. Uncannily every other button on the controller worked as it was intended to.\n\nRooms is very much a child friendly game but it offers more than sufficient challenge to keep grown up players amused as well. I would heartily recommend Rooms: The Unsolvable Puzzle to players who enjoy logic puzzles from the ages of about ten to one hundred. The game should hold mass appeal across all age groups. A truly energetic puzzler with great development value.\n\nFor more reviews similar to this one and our daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/","January 13","true","6.5"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

There was no walkthrough available at the time, but with the help of another person I was able to beat the game. As far as whether or not they can all be solved in the minimum number of moves, I haven't achieved that yet, but I assume they all can. Anyway, it IS a fun game, but quite frustrating at times. I recommend this game, but not if you're looking for easy puzzles.","May 30, 2015","true","119.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It's a sliding block puzzle game with a lot of extra mechanics, such as puppets that chase you and explode in your face, locked rooms, boarded up rooms, etc. The mechanics are quite clever and the game does a great job of walking you through each new mechanic, though I hated the mirrored rooms with a passion.  Instead of timing you, the game keeps track of moves.  If you go "over par" you get fewer puzzle pieces awarded.  In reality, this only hurts if you're achievement hunting, but it still encourages you to find the best way to solve each room.\n\nThe game is set with a fairy tale background - a mysterious tinker who becomes evil and you, the little girl, are fated to be his next victim if you can't figure out the rooms in his house.  Unlike many games, there is a very good reason that the tinker's house is puzzles.  Spoiler - it's not because he gives his victims a sporting chance.\n\nBecause all of the puzzles are sliding rooms, and there are a LOT of rooms, it's best to play this game in chunks over a few weeks so the game doesn't feel repetitious.  In some of the rooms, the girl has an animation of a tired sigh.  That's probably what'll you be doing in real like if you try to do a marathon session of this game.\n\nThe one thing I didn't like was that the mansion is pretty linear.  If you get stuck on a room, you don't have many places to go otherwise.  If you're stuck on room 4, you can't skip to room 5.  You have to get though half of one bulding before you unlock the next one, so you can get get bogged down by a single room.  You can do the basement, but that's significantly more difficult and the same "no skipping rooms" rule applies.\n\nSome people have said that the endings are too short (one for completing the main buildings, one for completing the basements), but they do fit the fairy tale motif.  It would have been nice to have longer, more elaborate endings, but they were appropriate  for the game.\n\nThe game isn't for everyone, but for those who enjoy this type of puzzle, it's well worth the price.","March 12","true","23.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I absolutely enjoyed playing this game. Very addicting and visually pleasing. The puzzles become really challenging towards the end (mix of mechanics), and thus it can get pretty stressful but still entertaining :) It also contains bonus levels which have slightly/completely different rules but still manageable.  The two different endings were also a good addition to the game however it could have had more depth, since it was predictible. Nice storytelling though, and you can never have enough of these clever puzzles(although there are over hundreds of 'em!).","April 20","true","15.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

However I'm not sure if it's linux version or what but the controller absolutely sucks. Not a single button on my controller could activate, bombs, levels, or phones. The rest is iffy at best. The navigation is hokey, and the d pad does not move you, dispite the "hint" at the right. Could not find ANY option to exit game, even esc gave no option to exit game. Had to alt-tab and close.\nConclusion, although puzzles are challenging and the ONLY enjoyable part of the game, the controller and the rest are complete crap. Feel very poorly thought out and executed. (note could be for linux port only)","November 27, 2015","false","1.4"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","2"
