I have hit almost 8000 hours... Okay, so lets not talk about how much of my life I have wasted on this game. What we should talk about is how cool the game is. Its casual, easy to play, no microtransactions, and just a good game overall. I like to play it with youtube or netflix open and just chill while I play watching a movie or something. This game gives a new meaning to "Netflix and chill". When I got this I expected just a game that I would play every once in a while... But I play it ALL the time. Awsome, adictive, casual, and fun. Nice for arcade gamers aswell.\n\nWhat more can you ask for for 4.99?\n10/10 wasted my leif on gaem IGN","November 18, 2015","true","846.7"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","92","23","25","10","9"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vmblood/recommended/3330/","vmblood","VolkmasterBlood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vmblood/","222 products in account","I remember getting trial versions of this game on older computers and playing the crap out of this game.  It was fun, addicting, and could put you in a daze very quickly.\n\nZuma Deluxe is a puzzle game where you control a rotating from from a top down view in what looks like an ancient Aztec/Mayan temple of sorts.  There is a track on the screen that has multicolored balls moving through the track.  The objective is to shoot colored balls from the mouth of the rotating frog onto balls along the track.  Once three or more colors are formed together from a ball from the frog's mouth, the balls disappear.  But watch out!  There is an end to the track!  So as your balls move along this track, if you don't lessen the line of the track, then you could easily find yourself in the losers pit.\n\nMy big deal is that I have played this game countless times before.  I didn't want to play through every single level ever all over again.  No big deal!  I played the first and second level, and the AI recognized my skill level and asked me if I would like to go to a level more fitting for my skill level.  Nothing makes me happier when a game recognizes my ability to play at a higher difficulty, and tailors itself to that difficulty.\n\nMake no mistake.  This game isn't a serious buy.  If you want something to pass the time, or get bored by the expensive AAA titles, pick up this game and give it a whirl.  If you hate time passing puzzle games, then you might not like this game.  I will never uninstall this title though.  Never.  Not even to make room for Deus Ex: Human Revoution.","January 6, 2015","true","4.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Therefore I give it a 9.  Not because its the most spectacular I have ever seen but because for its genre it has substantially more than is required.\n\nSounds and Music  8/10\n\nThe music and sounds on the game are above average for its genre.\n\nGameplay 9/10\n\nThe game has many levels in the adventure mode for you to play.\n\nFun 9/10\n\nOne of the reasons  why I do not like ot put this game on my pc is because it is so addicting that I don't want to quit playing once I start.  Hence a 9.\n\nPrice/value: You will definitely get your money's worth on this one.\n\nBugs and Execution:  None.  Runs flawlessly on windows XP, Vista and windows 7.   The only problem I have experienced is that steam screenshots do not work.  You will have to make them manually using the shift+printscreen button and paste to a bitmap for editing if you wish to make screenshots of  your high scores (see my artwork for an example)\n\nOverall : This game is a classic in its genre.","January 26, 2015","true","47.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This was my second PopCap game and it is other great puzzle game. Although it was heavily inspired in Puzzle Loop I really like PopCap's version. The goal is to control a (stone?) frog that sends coloured balls to destroy others of the same colour, and all of this to free a god from a spell and be accepted among them. It is fun and addictive, but it is a really difficult game. The Adventure mode gets progressily hard by adding more colours, harder maps and reaching "Zuma!" takes longer. Be prepared for frustration after you clear the first two temples! Then there is the Gauntlet mode where it works as a survival mode and you try to break your own records as soon as you unlock more maps. And sadly it is all what Zuma Deluxe offers so expect repetitiveness. If you enjoy a casual puzzle game but yet challenging, Zuma Deluxe is worth a trial.","April 18, 2015","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
