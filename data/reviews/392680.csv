The text was so hard to read! Don't let the visuals put you off - once I got to the gameplay it won me over quickly. Now I've grown to love the look and style (especially the bright neon cityscape) and I can't wait to beat it on the hardest difficulty.\n\nI have a feeling Jeeboman will be compared to Space Pirate Trainer a lot, and while I wouldn't say the comparison is unfair, to me they almost feel like separate genres. Space Pirate Trainer is one hundred percent about chaos. You're in the middle of it and there's nothing you can do but blast your way through. Jeeboman is more about trying to avoid chaos by zipping around to (briefly!) safe locations and taking enemies out from a distance. There's plenty of blasting, don't get me wrong, but there's also more room for long-term strategey and careful decision making.\n\nIf you're looking for a fun arcade shooter with just the right amount of strategy and pretty good replay value give this one a shot.","April 7","true","0.6"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

To me, it is genre defying.\nCONS:\nThe introduction / tutorial are off-putting (but resist through the first 10 minutes and then the gameplay is fun.)\nDeveloper! Come on, let people start directly inside the training-room! (and let the tutorial be an option only after the players fail the training room).\nThe colors are a bit strange.\nThe 'easy' level feel quite difficult / frantic, but it makes for good physical exercise, I guess.","April 16","true","0.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LiquidAvatar/recommended/392680/","LiquidAvatar","LiquidAvatar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LiquidAvatar/","495 products in account","It's a little hard to rate Jeeboman.  The guns are really fun to use and this is probably one of the fastest paced VR games created (you have to stay very mobile while keeping yourself oriented and constantly shooting), which I really enjoy.  It's also a really short game; it only takes me about 30 minutes to play through.  In the end, this feels similar to the light gun arcade games of my childhood (like Area 51); you're not playing to win, but rather because the experience is so fun.  That said, I really hope that more levels are eventually released, or at least features to encourage replays/improve your ability (like a high score system).\n\nI definitely recommend at least trying the demo; the full game is basically a longer version of it + a final boss fight.","May 6","true","3.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I have a feeling I wouldn't like something so fast paced if it were controlled on a classic keyboard, but I was surprised how much I enjoyed it on the Vive.  You have to constantly teleport as well as physically move (A tip: don't use the shield too much, it drains the battery quickly, keep teleporting).  This was the first game to get me to break a sweat (and that was on normal difficulty), and unlike Space Pirate Trainer, I don't feel like my small play space limits my ability to survive.","May 17","true","1.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There are too many enemies that swarm you from all directions without any kind of indication of where they are coming from. In its current state I can't recommend it. The idea is brilliant. But execution needs some work. The game would benefit greatly from an ingame radar or similar.\n\nEdit: The game is show shallow and there is so little to do, it's pretty easy to make this judgement with the small amount of time played.","April 17","false","0.1"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","5","11","0","3"
