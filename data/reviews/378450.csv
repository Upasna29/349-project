The gameplay is overly simple and it gets old very fast.  At least it runs well and has decent graphics.","January 7","false","1.8"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","11","15","2","0"

The visuals are crisp and colourful and the soundtrack is great; it fits the action perfectly.  It's fun bunching up a load of robots around one of the explosive barrels and taking them all out with a well-timed shot. I can imagine the game would get a bit repetitive after extended play; best enjoyed in short bursts. Worth a try.","February 24","true","1.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"
