Decapitations, limbs getting severed, bodies just exploding into nothingness, etc.\n- Some neat locales and cool set-pieces\n- Serviceable story. There were probably plenty of holes but as an excuse for an action game, it ain't bad.\n\nBad stuff\n- High-gravity powers are bland. One of them stops enemies from moving. Why stop when you can kill? The other creates a shield. That's nice I suppose but as soon as you get the shield enemies start doing more damage, so you're kinda forced into using it.\n- Bosses get re-used so much. It's not noticeable at first but at around the 4 hour point (6 hour game) bosses are introduced and then ran into the ground.\n-Difficulty needs polishing. The default setting is more than do-able, but if I could go back I would have went with something easier. That way I could focus more on using powers and not have to worry about some stray explosion wiping me out.\n-The last couple weapons are energy-based. They cover the enemy in blue-white flames which kinda makes it hard to tell that you've killed them. It's just not as satisfying when you can't see their arms fly off, their head pop like a meat balloon, and so on.\n-General nitpicky stuff that an extra month in QA could have fixed.\n\nAll in all Inversion is good dumb entertainment. It's basically Timeshift influenced by Gears of War. Give it a go if you can find it on the cheap.","July 20, 2014","true","6.0"," 48 of 55 people (87%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","87","48","55","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/212410/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Inversion is a cover-based first-person shooter from Saber studios, creator of 2007’s Timeshift. Knowing this you can expect a decent shooter.The story sees you play as cop Davis Russell, who along with his partner Leo Deglado, is in the midst of an alien invasion and looking to find Davis’ daughter. Set in the near future, an unknown army of evil enemies called the Lutadores have invaded the Earth and as Davis you struggle to battle this enemy through a rubble-strewn world where Gravity is not always as simple as being up and down.The character design and overall look and feel of the game is pretty good. The enemy have been designed to have a humanoid looking appearance but the language they speak indicates they are not a local enemy and could be from another planet.  Amongst this enemy you have your standard grunts and varying classes of enemy, including bosses.The difficulty of the game is something that really needs to be addressed before I talk more about the game. From the off, Inversion has 3 difficult settings, Low Gravity (easy), Normal Gravity (normal) and High Gravity (hard). If you are tough enough to complete the High Gravity setting you will unlock Black Hole gravity, however this does not have any achievements or trophies attributed to completing it.While the difficulty varies throughout the game, the levels are very linear, as you are guided from A to B of each checkpoint. There are no collectibles and no real exploration needed and this is a bit disappointing for a current gen game when compared to other shooters on the market.As you travel through each level you are accompanied by Leo. Players have the option to buddy up and use Leo as a multiplayer co-op experience, which is highly recommended, because the AI on this game is awful.The Unique selling point of the gravity shift has both a positive and negative impact on the game. There are sections of the game where you encounter gravity shifts that turn the environment upside down or on its side. This sounds like a novel addition to an FPS, but it does little to change the gaming experience, because you are doing the exact same thing you were doing a minute ago on the ground.The positives to the single player campaign though, and the most notable, is the zero gravity segments where gravity has been lost and you float through the environment using cars and rocks that have been left hanging in the air as cover against the enemy.You are able to reverse gravity and send enemies to their knees, which is great, but again does not offer very much. The other option that this low gravity ability has, is that it gives you a shield. Again, this can be very handy in those parts of the game that Saber have decided to make extremely difficult for no reason.With the solo campaign all covered, it would be remiss if I didn’t talk about the multiplayer aspect of this game. The matchmaking menu and options are great, with a huge amount of variety that players would expect to see in an FPS multiplayer, such as capture the flag, death match, team death match.It is a shame that with the wide variety and huge amount of challenges to complete in multiplayer, such as weapon and match type challenges that the matchmaking system was awful in allocating me a party.In summary, Inversion is a pretty good shooter that is worth being looked at by any fan of the genre. It is an enjoyable playthrough but not something that screams for a repeat performance.","December 22, 2014","true","12.3"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","18","20","0","0"

Here is your chance.\n\nThis is an underestimated game for sure. Dont get why it got slammed in the reviews. One reason is that it might have been broken. In the main menu you can see it´s version 5 point something. Patched many times since release in other words. The coop worked for me without a hitch. Im in sweden and my partner lives in the US. Pretty much as far apart as 2 humans can be on this earth. =)\nSome of the game takes place in the city. This is its weak point. In general this is a well designed game that really shines in some areas and by doing so, the lesser parts stand out. It has better physics than most games. A lot of destructable things to play around with. A bit in to the game you get the ability to throw cars at people. Awesome. It´s no 10 out of 10 game. It has flaws.\n\nLess awesome aspects:\n\nActing could be better and the voices could be better implemented with a smoother transition on a surround system. It kind of jumps from one speaker to another.\nNo vsync in a world that is constantly rumbling and moving around. Playing on my tv and the tearing is horrible. Thank god for the ability to force it via the GPU driver. Or you create a textfile named config.cfg in the folder with the .exe and in that file you type vsync=1.\nSome areas in the city are dull.\nA few choke points where the difficulty level feels insane.\nToo few easter eggs.\n\nMore awesome aspects:\n\nMost of the time the game looks great.\nCool physics and well made pyrotechnic effects. Havok engine makes some of the explosions look beutiful.\nGravity link is cool.\nLots of destroyable ♥♥♥♥.\nCool story.\nNice character models, the "fat friend" is one of them.

I guess its cause the Co Op and Multiplayer doesn't work but as a single player game, its fine. It has everything a third person shooter needs. It has a good story, good weapons, amazing graphics and is actually quite challenging. Its longer then an average shooter but it is still shorter then I'd like. The main characters are a bit bland and the story left with a ton of mystery but leave it to Namco to have amazing cutscenes. Probably some of the best Cutscenes I've ever seen since Lost Planet. Although the game does crash at times. Plus the bot partner is smarter then most as he does actualy fight and use gravity weapons and your not constantly having to save him. Still, he doesn't use any other weapons then the ones assigned to him. This is a great game for 3 bucks and I think more people should enjoy it for its single player content. I was planning on playing it that way anyway so I don't care about co op or multiplayer.

The areas where you do battle in this game are for the most part,interesting and varied. The game really has a world that gives off an invasion-like atmosphere.\n\n+Story\nThe story is what I really loved about this game. It may not be the best but it sure as hell got me interested in what was going to happen next.You play as a cop named David Russell with your partner Leo Deglato.The game is set during an invasion of your home,Vanguard City,by a race of gibberish-speaking humanoids called the lutadores. They are brutal savages and this is apparent very quickly as they begin to mow down every civilian in sight.You and Leo begin a long quest to try and find your daughter in a city filled with savages.\n\n+Kills\nThis game has incredibly satisfying kills. You may shoot a guy in the head and his head will explode with a satisfying sound. You might shoot a behemoth with a rocket and have him explode into a shower of blood,leaving limbs and blood everywhere.\n\nCons-AI\nThe AI in this game is awful. Leo's AI is completely incapable of covering you and I'm not even sure he actually deals damage. The enemy AI is to run to cover and shoot. No flanking or anything they just get to cover and shoot until they die.\n\n-Gameplay\nBoy this is one hell of a bland game.Early on you get a weapon called the grav-link which allows you to use low grav abilities like making enemies fly out of cover or even picking up and throwing objects like rocks. At different scripted points in the game you can get upgrades for this such as being able to use high grav abilities that can pull enemies to the ground or apply a shield. There are also points in the game where you fight in no gravity zones using different objects(Cars and Rocks)as cover. This may sound cool but is no different from being on the ground as the game plays exactly the same.\n\n-Crashes\nThroughout my playthrough this game crashes almost 20 times. This game will randomly crash during cutscenes and loading screens. The game is also very linear and runs on checkpoints so this could end up setting you back a bit.\n\n-Difficulty\nThis game is typically pretty easy. There is 3 difficulty modes,High Gravity,Low Gravity,and Normal Gravity. However there are a few "boss fight" type encounters like with enemies called slave drivers and with a couple kinds of mechs.The game gets incredibly hard during some of these boss encounters such as the slave drivers and will require multiple tries and perseverance to get through.\n\nIf you found this review helpful or entertaining then feel free to join my Steam Curator Group at  Mudkips Gaming","June 3, 2015","false","10.0"," 34 of 55 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","34","55","2","0"

But this one uses the gimmick of gravity. Does it work? Yeah I guess it does. I got a real Homefront vibe from this game (only as a third person shooter without obvious product placement). Your world is invaded and you have to fight through waves of enemies amongst destroyed buildings and the like. What Inversion does differently is the ability to use gravity. You can lighten the gravity on your enemies to make them float or later in the game, use it to crush them.  The guns felt a bit underpowered but there is a nice variety of them. The gravity thing was useful at times when you run out of bullets or you have to solve a very minor environment puzzle.  The story was interesting which brings me to the cutscenes. There are ALOT of them. Like you kill a few guys and wham. Into a cut scene. You'll either like it or hate it but I felt it drove the story forward so I pressed on. I have to say though. The end was a freaking downer. No spoilers but I could see the devs wanted to go against type but I didn't care for it personally. This game looks like it supports co-op and that would probably fun but your AI partner wasn't bad. I picked this up from Amazon for under a bit $5 so it was well worth it to me. If you can get it in the $10 range you'll get your moneys worth too. Overall Recommended.","March 14, 2013","true","8.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Not for me, anyway. There is no vsync in-game so I had to force it through Nvidia control panel but no biggie. It is a standard linear third person shooter with a twist: you can lift enemies and objects into the air with your gravity attachment by pressing E and can also press Q to grab a floating object then throw it. During parts of the levels you also get to float around in low-gravity sections and even walk on walls or ceilings, or fight enemies that are grav locked onto a ceiling which is pretty cool fighting upside down enemies. The weapons are all pretty standard and it has one of the most satisfying double barreled shotguns I have ever seen in a game. It shreds enemies. The sounds and voices are all good and the graphics are not bad and the enemies are pretty standard alien dudes. The game is very linear but I don't really know any third person shooters that aren't to be honest.

A lackluster story and generic gameplay hidden behind semi-high production values. From the boring enemies that constantly remind me of God Hand but are nowhere near as interesting, to gameplay that promises to do so much and delivers so little it becomes more of a chore than a fun coop experience.\n\nSome things it promises are destructable environments and controlling gravity. Well, most of the environment that gets destroyed is YOUR cover by enemies, not the other way around. As for the gravity powers, there's nothing very spectacular about it. It's a mix of Half Life and Psi Ops: Mindgate Conspiracy. Now this game is touted as a coop one. How does that hold up?\n\nThere are a lot of action sequences and using your powers to help each other or provide cover fire is important, but it's all marred by the soft relationship context moments where you have to 'bro' boost over a ledge or 'bro' hold a garage-ish door open so that the other guy can go through. It ends up becoming an awkward moment that really does nothing to help you feel like you're really working together to accomplish something. Instead of smart puzzles, you just get 'bro'ments.\n\nBy the end of the game, you will feel like there should and could have been so much more. It's sad because it could have been a great arcade experience, but focuses too much on its unpolished story and clunky gameplay moments to carry it across when those are its weakest points. The result is something that makes you want to finish but never provides any incentive to return. A decent 1 time play, but wait until it's super cheap before purchasing.","November 17, 2012","false","8.1"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","4"

First thing first, if you have an AMD card, download D3DOverrider and force vsync. There's no vsync option in game and the AMD Catalyst Driver doesn't work if you try to force it through there.\n\nNow then, I guess, I mean, it's not a terrible game. The story can be debated as to whether or not it's decent. Let me just say that it runs extremely well, the graphics are decent, and the audio design is good. What people, such as myself, find awful are a slew of other things. The voice acting and written dialog are rather atrocious. "♥♥♥♥! The ground's shakin'" "We're seperated, I'll find another way around!" "We're in space?!?! On a space ship?!?" It's just not good writing. Secondly, lack of variety in enemies. The boss fights are way too repetitive. The story, while it kept my attention, it was pretty mediocre.\n\nYou play a cop who, in the middle of an alien invasion, gets captured with his partner. The whole story surrounds this cop, after escaping a prison, fighting his way to try and find his daughter, which ultimately leads him to fighting his way to the alien Lutadore leader. It was about as generic as generic gets. There is one plot twist that caught me off guard; all spoilers aside, the planet you live on isn't a planet at all. It's some dome that's actually a space ship. Surprise! My problem with this revelation is the context of it. There's no bloody context as to why these humans are living on this dome. Are they some kind of science experiment? Who cares!?!? Honestly, at least leave behind some clues with collectibles or something. The devs did jack squat to explain it.\n\nWell, this Gears of War clone wasn't that great to be honest. I give it a 5.5/10. If you like cheesy, cliched, generic third person shooters, this is the perfect game for you.","April 25","false","8.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/youreviltwin/recommended/212410/","youreviltwin","your evil twin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/youreviltwin/","470 products in account","A suprisingly good game. Some critics have dismissed Inversion as a Gears of War rip-off, and while it does have some obvious similarities I found that I enjoyed Inversion far more!\n\nThe story starts like a typical invasion story, but it actually has some crazy twists and becomes pretty interesting. I found myself compelled to keep playing to find out who the mysterious bad guys were and where they came from, and the answer did not disappoint. The game has colourful environments rather than being all grey or brown, and there is an impressive amount of attention to detail in the level design. The two heroes are much more likeable than the guys in GOW; they are tough guys but they are not cartoonish macho thugs, they are horrified by what is going on around them. I especially liked the player's partner Leo, who is very crass and vulgar but actually quite smart and the one who tries to figure out what is really going on. It also helps that in singleplayer your partner has excellent AI and is always a help rather than a hiderence.\n\nThe gameplay is a pretty competent cover-based third-person-shooter, but with a bunch of nice extra features. Inversion has impressive "Havok Destruction" physics that mean sustained fire will smash cover to pieces, so you have to keep moving rather than hide in one spot. There are fun bits where you are floating around in zero gravity or where walls or ceilings become the floor, which spices things up nicely.\n\nEarly in the game you aquire the Gravlink device and get special gravity powers. In the tutorial section you get to try out several abilities, but then this power is snatched away from you and you get a basic version that just lets you use Low Gravity to make objects and people float into the air.\n\nFloating enemies take several seconds to adjust to their new situation before they resume shooting at you, and of course they are nice easy targets. The game includes typical red explosive barrels, but there are also yellow barrels that do nothing except leak when shot; however using low gravity on a yellow barrel will create a floating spherical blob of flammable liquid. You can also do a gravity shockwave attack that tears enemies to pieces, it's much better than a normal melee attack as it can kill multiple enemies, has a range of a couple of meters, and it can penetrate cover.\n\nYou gain more powers by killing bosses and taking components from their Gravlinks. You'll get the ability to grab or throw objects like Half-Life L2's gravity gun... in fact, it can even throw enemies at each other, so it is like the Super Gravity Gun that you get at the end of HL2! To prevent this from being ludicrously overpowered, so you can only grab and throw things that you have first made float using your zero gravity ability, but since you can make entire groups of enemies and objects float with just one or two low gravity blasts this is not a big inconvenience. Later you get an upgrade that allows you to throw huge objects like cars. It is especially important to remember this ability in tough fights; killing a giant boss enemy with an assault rifle takes an absurd amount of time, throwing objects at bosses is far more effective.\n\nLater in the game you get High Gravity. You can use it on structures like guard towers and bridges to cause them to collapse, and you can cause hanging objects to fall to create cover. High Gravity pins tough enemies to the ground and make them helpless, while weaker enemies will be splatted against the floor and instantly killed. While in High Gravity mode your ability to grab and throw objects is replaced with a very effective defensive shield. The shield is essential for surviving battles in the last third of the game, and you have to get good at managing your energy so you can protect yourself and also have enough energy to do gravity attacks on enemies.\n\nOne criticism I have is that Inversion has a rather absurd number of cutscenes, like Max Payne 3 or Metal Gear Solid. You can skip them if you want to, though I recommend watching them otherwise you might miss an importatant plot point. (And in any case they were entertaining most of the time.)\n\nThis game is about messing with gravity, and I recommend that you do it constantly. If you just rely on your guns then it will seem like a pretty typical shooter, but the real fun comes from using your powers as often as possible. It is immensely satisfying causing a sniper to float out of cover, sucking him towards you and then punching his head off. Or running into the middle of a group of enemies, and just before being killed you do a ground shockwave attack and cause the entire group to explode into gory pieces. Ludicrous gibs = ludicrous fun.","December 20, 2012","true","124.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

Enemies can simply hit you and you do not really have the best tactics to defeat your foes. There is a lot of trial-and-error here that makes the gameplay very irritating.\n\nThere are some really good ideas such as the gravity gun that lets you levitate objects. This should be used in several boss battles instead of the good old pull-the-trigger-until-it-dies method.\n\nInversion is not a bad game. It has potential but could have been given more polish.

I got the game when it was on sale and finished it  in 26 hours on hard difficulty. In the end it did not feel rewarding or satisfying at all.\nIf you've seen any trailers for Inversion then you may be excited to try out the gravity inverting gameplay that was the main selling point of the game. Indeed you can have some fun with it. But it does not last long at all. It works well in the introductory stages of the game.\n\nThe first 2 or 3 areas are actually somewhat well designed and exciting even. However the fun ends as suddenly as it starts. You will keep expecting and waiting for "something" to start, for some kind of exposition. Instead you will be treated with a lot of the same. After the areas that were paid attention to Inversion almost changes direction and feels like either different people picked up the game 1/3 in and had to quickly finish it and patch it up. If not that, then it definitely feels like a lot of the same on and on.\n\nSome action sequences and area segments are just atrocious. But besides the level design and the misleading story you will also immediately feel like you have played this game before. It borrows so much and so liberally from other games that it is not even funny as a homage. It is visible in the enemies design, in the crouching behind cover mechanic, in the sound effects, and in the plot itself.\n\nIt is difficult to add anything substantial without spoiling the game, even though there is not much to spoil, but if you can skip it, I would skip it. If you had already decided to skip it, then take a look at the story cutscenes or reviews on YouTube to get an idea.","April 29, 2014","false","26.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Despite having a  wonderful set of ideas Inversion is held back by alot of the dudebro mechanics (e.g. Co-op) that are sellotaped onto the majority of third person shooters these days. It doesn't help either that Inversion leaves a poor first impression and the better physics based features in the game aren't unlocked until atleast three hours into the experience. Even so, Inversion is still worth your time because, for better or for worse, it harks back to a period in which the B-Tier game reigned supreme.

Slap a new story, characters and assets onto it, with your own proprietary engine and you've got Inversion.\n\nAnd I'm not kidding, this game almost MIRRORS Gears of War down to every detail; the weapon selection system, movement, combat, some of the interface design, weapon functionality (an example being that grenades show you where they'll land, just little things like that), weapons, some of the enemies, cover system and essentially even Locust holes, even requiring a grenade to "close" them up.\n\nI primarily bought this game out of technical interest, seeing as it used the same engine as TimeShift and their latest game, God Mode. But other than some odd curiosity, I can't recommend this at all as something to have great fun playing through as the game remains repetitive and the story dull.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that I found the dialogue incredibly difficult to hear, as the audio system seems to add some really awful sounding echo in some places and the default sound levels tend to cause the music and other audio to muffle it. It's a good idea to turn both the music and SFX volumes down about half-way before proceeding to play, from my personal experience anyway.","December 31, 2014","false","3.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

It is repetitive bland and uninteresting, the characters are flat the dialogue shallow and the story just bland. You go from one arena to the next fighting unintelligent enemies with little variety. In one session I had felt like I had played four hours only to realize it had been one and a half, amplifying my feeling of boredom. If you are interested in the game's more intriguing side there are the gravity sections which can yield some fun screenshots but really nothing more.","February 23, 2014","false","3.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It uses the Gear of War approach to cover based combat, 2 gun, melee, and companion AI gameplay.\n\nSo basically it is a Gears of War knock off with Gravity effects.  It is not a bad game at 7-8 hours to beat but it is also not a good game.  You can tell the creators wanted to make an awesome game, but likely had someone breathing down their neck to make a Gears of War style game and ultimately it suffered into somewhat busted game.\n\nYou can see they wanted to make itt more of an emotional, physics, gravity, and teamplay game... but somewhere it was ruined by making it a cover based shooter with cheap death tactics.  Not a difficult game but it did cheat me a few times with glitches and instead death I could not control.\n\nNot bad - only recommend if you like Gears of War gameplay and you want to play its less interesting cousin.","December 28, 2012","true","8.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There's not much variety or innovation in the gameplay, nevertheless it accomplishes what it sets out to do very well. It features fun combat with plenty of blood and gore, good level design, a decent narrative, and pretty graphics. I especially like the way the game dumps you into the middle of an invasion with no idea who your enemies are or what they want. The progression of the story is very well done even if the dialogue is a bit cheesy, and the storyline itself is surprisingly original and feeds you a little at a time, to keep you interested. There are some very nice twists which I didn't expect.\n\nIf you're in the mood for an action packed Michael Bay style third person shooter, this game is very good value for money.

There are no Achievements, no secrets, no secret ending, but that is all fine, i like it that way.Game play was awesome, u have sort of a gravity gun with which u can make enemies float or clear the way from debriss and stuff like that. I also enoyed the zero gravity parts where u just float around, move from one debriss to the other while shooting enemies. Story wise it was ok, nothing outstanding, it did have some plotholes (or maybe i didn't understand it well enough) but all in all it wasn't bad. Also the campaign can be played with a co-op partner, which probably would be actually better because the AI of the partner was kind of stupid at times and he would get stuck in places and die and then you would have to move out of cover to help him up. But despite all of it's flaws i enjoyed the game a lot, would definitely recommend playing this one.","January 3, 2014","true","10.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

As I kept playing, however, I realized that this game is just your run-of-the-mill bad.\n\nGunplay is weak and unsatisfying as there are only 3 guns in this game - assault rifle, shotgun, and sniper - and they all sound like "pshew pshew".  Combat is simply not fun.\n\nVoice acting is absolutely horrible!  I mean, the actors really phoned it in for this one, and it doesn't help that your best friend follows you for the whole game and won't stop saying moronic quips like "Hey, good kill, man!" or "You just shot a civilian, bro!"  Real talk, play this game on mute.\n\nThe cherry on top is the random, unexplained crashes to desktop.....like the game wants you to stop playing.\n\nImagine if Gears of War was really, really bad - that's what Inversion is.  Inversion is a third-person-shooter with cover mechanics where you use the D-Pad to switch between weapons, and you fight humanoid enemies that come out of the ground alongside your hispanic best friend using an assault rifle with a large melee attachment, and also everything sucks.\n\nThe tiny, tiny moments of "not crap", like the zero-G fight segments or the surprise twist (just look it up, don't bother playing this game to find out), are smothered by the fact that the rest of this game is absolute trash.\n\nIf it was just a little bit worse, at least you could have had a laugh at it.\n\nDon't buy this.","December 12, 2015","false","6.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you've played Gears of War, that is pretty much exactly what the combat is. The gravity manipulation is a pretty fun and neat twist which can open up the path to progression and pull enemies out from cover. The cover is also destructable, so you (and the enemies) can't hide behind it forever.\n\nThe big issue is the design of the overall game. Here is how an early part goes: [Cutscene], you walk down the street, [Cutscene], you turn the corner [Cutscene], you kill two guys [Cutscene]. For the hour and a half to two hours I've played, that is how the whole thing has been. Well, I say "played", but a lot of that was watching cutscenes. I'm not one of those people who hates cutscenes and thinks that they should not exist, but this game can not go more than [literally] five minutes without one. I will say that they ARE skippable, but even then, having to skip one every few minutes is annoying and to the point where I've given up on the game. Maybe down the road I'll give it another shot, and maybe further in they let you play for more than 5 minutes at a time, but for now I'm moving on.","October 18, 2014","false","1.4"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

I think TimeShift was a big letdown. Inversion is also a letdown! Here's Inversion: take Gears of War (literally all of it, the bad guys coming out of the ground, the cover system, the two weapon and grenades limit, the "find my " story, buddy of Hispanic descent, everything), and add in some goofy gravity tricks. You've got a gun that can lower gravity and raise gravity in small areas. You pass through some zero gravity areas by moving from one chunk of environment to another. Your gravity gun can also pick up and throw stuff, like cars, which only becomes useful when you're forced to do it to defeat a boss. The story is just as quickly vomited out at the end as it is in Gears of War.

From its story, setting and characters, to it's pop-n-shoot gameplay, you will be constantly reminded of Epic's opus in grey-and-brown. It's only in the very last 10% of the game that Inversion finally starts to develop a personality of its own.\n\nBut for all that they blatantly stole so much from Gears, the developers failed to take the one thing that really mattered; interesting gameplay. And let's face it; Gears of War barely qualifies as interesting itself, so you know Inversion has to be  scraping the barrel if they can't even match the pedantic gameplay of Gears. The game has horrible controls (not that surprising in a port but disappointing nonetheless).  Its enemies and levels are hardly notable and its gunplay is bog-standard. The hook to Inversion is its ability to play around with the gravitational field, but nothing Inversion does is new or memorable. And, oh god is this game in love with its cut-scenes; it seems almost every action you take triggers a scripted - and uninterruptible -  animation.\n\nOn the plus side, there's some nice destructibility of the environments and the graphics are passable, especially consider it is a multi-platform title. But its reliance on cliched gameplay and shoddy technical aspects result in a poorly-designed, uninteresting mess of a game","November 25, 2013","false","11.3"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

Gravity manipulation. Does it hold up well? For starters, it failed the two hour test --that is, when I play a game, I give it 2 hours to either entertain me or interest me. It did neither.\n\nFrom the perspective of someone who's only played a couple of hours, I couldn't push myself to care. The story was bland, and there were more than a few groan-worthy moments within the first ten minutes. Characters came off quite generic, enemies seemed dull, and the gravity mechanic just didn't entice me. The only saving grace for this game is playing the story in co-op, because it might be fun to make fun of its generic-ness, but I don't know.

Later you can throw cars and charge up using a classic "Finger of Death" ability on enemies which instagib them.

Enemies will be pushed to the ground, or groups can be insta gibbed after you "Low" lifted them from the ground and then "High" smash them into the floor turning them into a mighty puddle of goo.\n\nLast but not least, the gravity is major in many areas allowing you to walk on walls, ceilings or fly through the air. It's like space floating just with breathable air and sound :P\n\nThe story is also quite interesting, and is a big twist compared to most games.

Would not recommend.\n\nStoryline - Standard save the world/family. Semi-decent twists. Biggest let down is that you play 90% of the game as a memory of the MC.\nI almost loved the story for how bleak the ending was. Daughter wound up dead anyway,and the father bites the dust as well. However, D wound up living, which kind of took out the impact of the ending for me. Since there wasn't a sequel or any additional lore (as far as I know), it suddenly feels unfinished. The whole dome-worlds thing was a bit of a slap to the face. I probably didn't spot any clues, but I caught zero foreshadowing the whole "we're not on earth" deal.\n\nGameplay - Overall bland. While the gravity manipulation is nifty, you really forget it's there until you fight a boss/snipers that demand its use to progress. It wasn't until the final two chapters that I actually started using the gravity abilities, as that's when I started having trouble with ammo conservation. *Played on highest difficulty setting*\n\nVisuals - The graphics were good for a somewhat aged game. The way the game moved (gameplay and cutscenes) made it feel like I was at an Arcade playing Inversion. I do appreciate that.\n\nBonus Points - Mother ♥♥♥♥ing PAUSE BUTTON during cutscenes! Yes. Learn from this, games that are 90% cutscenes and 10% actual gameplay. Learn from it.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't recommend Inversion.\nI really had to push myself to finish this game after putting it on hold for 2 months or so.\nI'm happy to have finished the story, but I simply could not see myself playing this a second time.","March 16, 2015","false","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Later you can throw cars and charge up using a classic "Finger of Death" ability on enemies which instagib them.

Enemies will be pushed to the ground, or groups can be insta gibbed after you "Low" lifted them from the ground and then "High" smash them into the floor turning them into a mighty puddle of goo.\n\nLast but not least, the gravity is major in many areas allowing you to walk on walls, ceilings or fly through the air. It's like space floating just with breathable air and sound :P\n\nThe story is also quite interesting, and is a big twist compared to most games.

The Megashark vs Giant Octopus of the 3rd person action genre.  Its sooo bad that its good. Best to play late at night when you are teetering on the verge of laughing at any little thing, and with a friend via co-op (although if you can figure out how to do that easily in this game, then its not late enough at night)\n\nTypical gameplay goes like this:  Combat for 30 seconds, then a 30 second cut scene. Then a movement stage of going from A to B for 20 seconds, then a 20 second cut scene. Then combat for 30 seconds... and the cycle repeats. Gameplay is interupted so much by cutscenes that it starts to get hilarious.\n\nThis is also one of those games where they put co-op type quicktime events in for no good reason. Oh look, a ledge, your buddy has to help you up, then you pull him up. Or having to hit "F" just to drop off a 4 foot ledge. Its just a speed bump in gameplay that serves no purpose, other than delaying how long it takes to see the next cut scene.\n\nSpeaking of cutscenes (and dialog), think Resident Evil 1. Its only a bit better, but every bit as funny. Some great moments: Walking down the street as a tricycle slowly comes rolling down the street towards us and my character says, "What the hell is that?" followed by the other character saying, "Where the hell did they get that?" It was just good timing, because they obviously werent talking about the tricycle, but it made for a hilarious situation. Expect laughable dialog such as "Stay tight, we've never been in this deep before" and "I guess this is where we go our seperate ways" from 2 cop buddies who have been through hell, and just gotten past a tough part. You find yourself saying, "Whaaa???" outloud a lot while playing.\n\nOne note: This game has a tendency to instant crash to desktop after any cutscene. Being that there are so many frequent cutscenes, it can be frustrating. Setting the exe to winXP compatability mode seems to help reduce it.\n\nMy son and I had more fun playing the game like we were watching a video from Birgirpall (look it up on youtube, you will understand), than if we actually tried to play it seriously. There are so many glitches and interactable objects in the world that cause just total random oddities. I know Namco tried to make a professional product, but this game really is just a bunch of laughs rolled up into something that is trying so hard to be something else.","June 22, 2014","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gravity mechanic would be better if using it to manipulate things didn't cause those things to block your view (thus making it unnecessarily difficult, bordering on impossible, to actually make effective use of the manipulated items).

The story is pretty good for a shooter, except the end which is a bit disappointing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/recommended/212410/","kschang77","kschang77","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/","993 products in account","Inversion is a trite cover shooter with one novel mechanic: ability to use gravity to your advantage. Pull enemies out of their cover, grab objects to throw when you run out of ammo or not doing enough damage, flip gravity to invert ground to ceiling and vice versa, and so on. The weapon mechanics are still the same as almost all cover shooters... move into cover, flip from cover to cover, blind fire, lean out and fire, and so on. You are always covered by your buddy. The story however, is cliche and over the top. The result is an also-ran that is worth bargain bin, but not full price.\n\nYou are Davis Russell, police in Vanguard City, and your buddy Leo Delgado were taking a lunch break and suddenly barbaric soldiers of type never before encountered, heavily armed, appeared out of nowhere and were basically killing everybody on sight. The pair fought their way into toward Russell's apartment, encountering gravitic anomalies. Upon reaching home, Russell found his wife dying and child missing. Wife died after uttering that the daughter was taken. The pair was soon knocked out by a powerful blast from an enemy lieutenant and taken prisoner, dumped into some sort of prison labor camp, where they learned the enemies are known as the Lutadores, and they have gravity manipulating technology. But where did they come from? After a chance encounter in the tunnels where the duo fought a killer robot using "gravlink", they encountered "Free Man" a resistance group member, who helped them to escape the camp into the city, where they fought their way back into the apartment looking for clues to the daughter's whereabout, then for the presence of Free Men, and perhaps they can help each other...\n\nIf I bored you with the B-movie plot... well, that's exactly what this game is. It is an also-ran, with the saving grave of the grav tech. Without it, you're basically at a rather... lame Gears of War clone. Even the weapons drew inspiration from GoW and a bit from Warhammer 40K.  There are occasion bits of brilliance, like combat in zero G zones, both positive G (make things heavy) and negative G (make things float) have tactical uses. Pull down floating crates/containers as cover, drop floating enemies to ground, flip the world upside down to get different cover, pull enemies under cover into the air, grab lava and fling it as weapon, there are uses for your grav weapon, but only occasionally. The rest of the time it's faster to shoot enemies instead, except the boss battles. Given you only have two weapons (and the grenade), combat is definitely "meh", esp. when the cover viewpoint doesn't quite shift properly, being "stuck" on over the right shoulder, even as you emerge from cover on the LEFT side.\n\nThere are co-op modes where up to 11 other players can join you to take on the Lutadores in the campaign, as well as various competitive PvP modes like deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, capture the flag, King of Gravity (i.e. gravity tag, where only one guy has the gravity rig, and everybody else can get it... by killing him) though they seem a bit boring.\n\nAnd let's just say there's a twist at the end, that will make you go... WTF?!?!?!?!  And no, it's not the ending. It's AFTER the ending.\n\nGraphics, sound, and voice acting are average to above average. Enemies are meh though.\n\nSo why do I still recommend this game? It's a nice change of pace with a "competent", albeit trite cover shooter. For $2.50, it's actually a decent value. Not for $10 though (the list price).\n","September 13, 2015","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After some introductionary scenes explaining and training your ability with the basic controls while the storyline evolves you and your partner are captured, after which the game crashes for not apparent reason whatsoever (if the devs read this, that actually happened after the destruction of the first Unknown Robot, but I won't go into too much detail here about that)...\n\nAnywho, what really gets this game going is the technology that enables you to shift gravity in objects you shoot at, or even yourself, allowing you to throw objects and enemies, pin them to the ground, walk on walls and ceilings, you name it. Combine that with a storyline that reminded me of Max Payne (for very apparent reasons if you have played both that game and this) and you really have something going.\n\nThe graphics look stunning closeby, but some objects did feel they were off, and some of the motion, especially on vehicles, looked really simple and something you'd expect to see in games 10 to 20 years ago... But then a building collapses in the distance with realistic smoke and debris flying everywhere, and then the building you're in does exactly the same and you forget all about that car or bus in the cut-scene.\n\nI really don't like 3rd person shooters that much, but this one did get me captivated. I'll have another go at it later and hope the crash thing is just once in a while. The game auto-saves (more checkpoint based actually I think) so... This one is definately a keeper. Not sure what's with the multi-player, but I'm not much of a multi-player anyways.\n\n","September 11, 2015","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In addition, you don't really even like the characters.  The other promising part is the interesting concept of rotating gravity.  Unfortunately, all it provides is a promise... that it doesn't keep.\n\nSo much for the positives.  The action is completely repetitive, especially when it comes down to the boss fights.  Most of the game is casual, but then you come to boss fights later in the game where the difficulty skyrockets to levels that don't even make sense.  It would be different if the difficulty was due to requiring skill, but instead if you basically just hvae to figure out which stupid strategy is going to be required.  Is it going to be spamming lava balls?  Is it going to be running like a decapitated chicken to keep distance?  Is it reviving your somehow previously useful teammate constantly?  Either way, it is more an annoyance than some accomplishment.\n\nHoly crap I almost forgot the cutscenes!  I have never seen so many of them in a game... ever.

Some game designers have come up with ways to focus your attention on action/story without pulling you out of the game to watch a movie.  This game apparently wants you to watch their movie while occasionally participating in moronic boss battles and repetitive enemies.\n\nThis game is a rip off of Gears of War for the cover, HL2 for the gravity gun, and SATs for repetitive misery.

There was either a demo released or some very good imagery in a video clip that made me think this was a good idea to purchase. There was just something in the controls that hindered by enjoyment as much as my player seemed hindered by allowed moving space. Weapons are also low in count; you can only carry two. I know, that's more realistic. But why not four as other games with similar play styles allow?\n\n3rd person shooters aren't an attractive style for me but at least two others that proved awesome, and still are, are in this genre & I thought I may be growing as a gamer. It was just a bit weak in range of motion, expected level progression, weapon usage, etc.\n\nOne small thing is the fact that one facet of the game took me 20 minutes to figure out. A simple button push. Not sure if I was tired that day or what but it must've been a control-tip I missed or it's something everyone would 'just figured out,' but being in a cave trying to manipulate things with the powers of anti-grav should've been intuitive. Maybe it's just me.\n\nGames looks pretty. It's a gritty terrain you must navigate. The story was starting to get interesting, partially, & yet my interest waned enough for me to 'uninstall' it. Maybe I'll get back to it someday but I doubt it, not with the library I already have beckoning me in differing directions.","December 31, 2015","false","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game takes that very concept and introduces it in a sort of Alien invasion setting. The story is told in a very cinematic way, which gets in the way of the gameplay. Many of the scenarios don't feel all that unique to most Trench-Style third-person adventures.It's almost as if a great deal of focus went into the Multiplayer vs the Main Story, which hurts the game's appeal, since it isn't available for MP or Co-op anymore. The lack of online Co-op forces you to rely on the Ai to not die(In which you will be given an opportunity to pick them up when downed). This can make the more difficult encounters more annoying, but not so much that it's a big issue.\n\nThe game's true faults start to arise when cutscenes clutter up the gameplay. It feels almost as if you never get a full experience until you've seen 8 or 9 cutscenes. The Linear nature of this game can be kind of limiting as well; but they did hide secret ammo stashes about the areas. Sometimes you'll get lucky and grab a really great weapon from one of these stashes that will make the limitations less apparent. Bosses are another thing handled pretty decently in this game, as they're not too difficult to send more casual players away; but offer enough challenge to put up a decent fight for anyone willing to select a higher difficulty. The Ai partner that you're forced to use now isn't too bad at holding his own; However there were segments when he would disapear. I theorized that he may have been stuck behind a game barrier during these sections.\n\nAfter reaching a little over the half way mark, the game's true issues start to become more of an overcumberence. The Lack of an efficient partner makes some sections more RNG based; so you're either going to have a partner capable of having your back, or you wont. The other major fault is the lack of variety in enemies, as boss fights are repeated in the later sections, and very little is done to differentiate the experience. The Gravity mechanic becomes less useful in combat; because the enemies take much more to kill than the powers you have available to you. Often you're made to take on swarms of enemies that can't be brought down easily. It also serves to note that this game will crash at random; but it's negligible since the game saves often. You wont find yourself forced to redo sections if it crashes.\n\nUpon reaching the bitter end of the game, it ramps up the difficulty once more; but the game cleverly forces you to attune yourself to using the gravity weapons, as ammo can easily run out. Ammo that once littered the area is difficult to stockpile, as well as some sections making you drop your secondary weapon if you happened to die before the next checkpoint. The repeated encounters with bosses is drummed up to a staggering bore at this point; but the variety is shaken up a bit. Combat becomes fierce and tactical as you progress through the final sections of the game; however the issues aparent with all of these Trench-Shooters start to become apparent. Not having a life bar often forces you to cowar in fear of the unkown amount of damage an enemy can inflict. It became frustrating not knowing whether I could weather a barrage of bullets,energy blast, fire, debris used as projectiles, or remain behind a safe barricade until I could pop my head momentarily to shoot.  I find these games rather enjoyable for the fast paced action (so I die alot.) If you've enjoyed this game, and are looking for something as fun as this, I can reccomend "Binary Domain",or "Vanquish" for your next adventure.","May 25","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
