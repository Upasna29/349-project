Let me explain: The fun in this game is learning, and growing your characters and items in level. The fun isn't in BEING level 100 with level 100 gear. The fun is in PROGRESSIVELY GETTING THERE. But the community is all about boosting, which can give you 30+ levels in an hour, and gifting high level (sometimes hacked) items. So instead of experiencing the joy of progressively getting there, increasing this and that, instead you are suddenly propelled to new heights. And while that boost seems great at the very moment it happened, this pleasure is infinitely short-lived.\n\nThis is the reason I created my group, Dungeon Defenders Hardcore, for players that care about having fun with the game, not just reaching level 100 ASAP.

Playing the game all the way up to lvl 70 pre-nightmare mode, the game is lots of fun and very unique. It is after that point where it just isn't worth it.\n\nThe person in charge of development got really greedy with the game and started releasing lots of dlc's, each one containing either one hero or one map. Which means you have to spend a lot of money to get the full experience of the late game.\n\nOn top of that, nightmare mode is such a cliff that you are pretty much forced to buy the summoner and EV dlcs in order to progress through it, as well as farm for hours in order to get decent items. The big flaw in the game is that it relies on RGN; the items rely on stats that are randomly generated. And instead of fixing this system, the devs decided to just give you more items so hopefully you eventually get a lucky drop. Most of the items generated are either missing key stats, or have negative values on them thus reducing your chances of getting anything decent.\n\nThe trading community is slowly dying if not dead, since most good players decided to move onto better games.\nSo like I said, I enjoyed the first few hours pre nightmare, but after that it just isn't worth your time or money.\n\nPS. Has your family or a good friend ever drag you to do something you do not wanna do but you do it anyway out of the goodness of your heart? yeah... that's why I played 500 hours of this game","December 25, 2013","false","528.7"," 114 of 163 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","114","163","0","15"

The game is filled with all sorts of entertainment, really all sorts. DD has not only classic maps, when you try protect your crystal from hordes of enemies but also various types of challenge, such as offensive defense, defense without towers, hunting turkeys, even challenge assist Cupid in love affairs and many others.\n\n- Game have very colorful graphics. Let everyone decide for themselves if this good or bad.\n\n- Game has a ton of weapons and armor with randomly generated characteristics.\n\n-In standard game only 4 classes, but with DLC number of heroes rise to 12\n\n- Each class has a unique traps or towers or another defense units.\n\n- DD have 5 levels of difficulty, and hardcore mode for true players\n\n- In the game you have the haven -  tavern, where you store all your cups, which represent your accomplishments\n\n- New equipment can received not only from  dropped by killing monsters, or collected as rewards after defeating waves of enemies, also you can visit in-game shops, and buy there new equipment.  Everyone players can create in-game shop.\n\n- All equipment have level and player can can raise this level by investing in equipment lot of mana.\n\nThe storyline is missing in the game, although there are a couple of movies. But all this is secondary. Almost all pastime in the game, we will killing monsters! We will be happy to kill them again and again, and we will receive level ups one by one, we will improve our weapons again and again. Everywhere will be a river of blood and body of orcs, that sunk into oblivion , we will step over them and kill new hordes , trying to get the coveted award.\n\nGame highly recommended for all fans of TD!!!\n\nRating 9 from 9,5\n\nSorry for my English!\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDungeon Defenders это не обычная Tower Defense - это экшен+рпг TD с видом от третьего лица и у разработчиков вышло просто отличное сочетание жанров. Игра наполнена всяческого рода развлечениями, на самом деле всех видов. ДД имеет не только классические карты, когда вы пытаетесь защитить ваш кристалл от полчищ врагов , но и различные типы испытаний , такие как уничтожение вражеских кристаллов , обора своего кристалла без башен , охота на индеек , даже испытание помощи Амуру в любовных делах ,когда вы будете выступать в роли его помощника сводя между собой пары одиноких орков.\n\n- В игре очень красочная и вычурная графика. Пусть каждый решает для себя хорошо или плохо.\n\n- Игра имеет тонны оружия и брони, стыты у которых рендомно генерируются.\n\n- В стандартной игре всего 4 классы, но с DLC количество героев вырастет до 12\n\n- Каждый класс обладает уникальными способами уничтожения врагов: ловушки, защитные и атакующие сооружения, призыв монстров.\n\n- В ДД есть 5 уровней сложности и хардкор режим для тру- игроков\n\n- В игре у вас есть убежище - таверна , где хранятся все ваши кубки , которые олицетворяют ваши достижения\n\n- Новый шмот может получить не только от убийства монстров , или награды за успешное прохождение карты , также вы можете посетить в игре магазины , и купить там новое оружие и броню . Каждый игрок может создать в игре магазины и продавать все что пожелает, ну почти все..\n\n- Вся экипировка имеет уровень и игрок может может поднять этот уровень , инвестируя в оборудование много манны, очень много.\n\nСюжетной линии как таковой в игре и нет. Но все это вторично. Почти все времяпрепровождение в игре, мы будем проводить убивая монстров ! Мы будем получать дикий фан делая это. Получая уровень за уровнем, апгрейдя оружие, мы будем убивать зеленых и не только орков всевозможными способами. Повсюду будут реки крови, ну или кристаллов, так как крови в игре и нет. Мы будем идти вперед переступая, через тела канувших в лету врагов, стремясь заполучить желанную награду. !\n\nИгра рекомендуется для всех поклонников TD !\n\nМоя оценка 9,5 из 10!!\n\nМой обзор Dungeon Defenders Eternity","November 30, 2013","true","252.7"," 68 of 95 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","68","95","0","0"

At the tail end of of almost a thousand hours, and after careful deliberation, I cannot find anything redeeming in Dungeon Defenders. Not its single-player, not it's multi-player, certainly not its Tower Defense, not its loot mechanics, and, most assuredly, not its community. The whole Dungeon Defenders experience, from the first achievement for simply following a tutorial, to the last achievement in killing four giant snowmen and an alcoholic Santa Claus, is garbage.\n\nLet me get this out of the way – The original thirteen maps of Dungeon Defenders and the original four classes, they're fine. The original, vanilla Dungeon Defenders experience, although simplistic, has a very clear and defined progression. Your four classes – the Apprentice, the Squire, the Huntress, and the Monk – are fairly well balanced for both solo play and multiplayer, and because you can swap characters during maps in solo play, you can make doubly strong defense setups with combinations from those four classes. It is entirely possible, with good tower strategies, to go from the beginning of the game to the end of the game – that is, from Deeper Well to Glitterhelm Caverns - all on the same difficulty with hardly any farming, up to the tail end of Insane difficulty. The original Dungeon Defenders, simplistic it may be, is roughly fifty hours of a tight tower defense experience with a lot of experimentation possible within it.\n\nEnter Nightmare. Enter spiders, enter djinns, and enter sharkens. Which, alright, those aren't bad. These are enemies that are designed to target and disrupt your defenses so that you'd have to reconsider your defense setups. Up to Insane, you weren't really punished for not using all four classes, so Nightmare is the point where the game decides to kick you around a bit and force you to play it better. So, you'll go back and level up a new class to use in conjunction with your usual class and take another crack at it.\n\nSo with a format like this, how did this game get screwed so badly?\n\nDLC upon DLC happened, ramping the game's difficulty by numbers up faster than players could keep up with it. You could gotten away with playing with lower stats if it weren't for the Sky City patch that introduced Goblin Copters. Goblin Copters dropping their buffed up Ogres on your defenses alone increased the minimum stat requirements for maps by quite a bit. After that, maps began spamming Ogres ad nauseum just as a difficulty supplement rather than having actual difficulty within the map's designs. Suddenly, people couldn't keep up with the game's difficulty without farming late waves of Survival mode for incrementally better gear. But the random number generator was bugged, so it wasn't giving out progressively stronger gear as often as it should have been. And so, people spent more time farming in the game than they do actually progressing in it.\n\nEntire class DLCs – The Series EV, the Jester, and the Summoner – were released just to keep the game possible to beat, rather than to supplement the game with new and interesting ways to play it. By the real end of the game, those classes are a requirement to succeed. If you favored the Squire or the Apprentice when you began playing the game, they are going to gather dust in your character roster because the real end of the game doesn't even have actual tower defense in the way that the very first thirteen maps do.\n\nLet's also keep in mind that most of the DLC is outsourced to the winners of map contests held by Trendy on their official Dungeon Defenders forums (that unnavigable mess) and other DLCs are very clearly sourced to a different set of developers from the initial game. What this means is that there's a ton of maps in the game that have an inconsistent graphical quality and difficulty – difficulty, by the way, at this point rarely amounts to anything more than using the same three correct classes over and over in the correct spots with no room for experimentation. Then, those maps take anywhere from twenty to forty minutes at a time because of rapidly inflating mob counts per wave.\n\nLook, I get that a difficulty name like “Nightmare” means, okay, the game is going to be hard now, and that naturally does mean you're going to need higher stats to beat older maps, as well as be pretty damn tough in order to meet the requirements of the endgame. That's standard difficulty in game design. And Dungeon Defenders does that! Initially, Nightmare mode challenges your perception of building maps to compensate for spiders dropping in behind your defenses, sharkens who can charge in and completely push them out of the way, and djinns who can just outright destroy them.\n\nBut, the metagame changed. Suddenly, the solution is always a line of summons on a buff beam underneath a stack of auras. Every special mob and the threat presents is handled by that solution alone. And with that one-size fits all solution, it becomes the only solution that maps are designed around. Difficulty is reduced to a stat requirement on a board that says, “Here. This is how difficult it is, this is what kind of numbers you need to scrape by on the skin of your teeth with, this is what kind of numbers you need to beat it comfortably and farm it, and this is what kind of super low number you can beat it with to stroke your ePeen. These are the points you need to put on the DLC Summoner, the DLC Series EV, the Monk, and the Huntress. Haha, what? Apprentice and Squire? Those aren't relevant.” And that says nothing of building a character for tackling bosses.\n\nOnce you get somewhere new in Dungeon Defenders, get comfortable. You're gonna be there for a while, until you get lucky. By a Trendy developer's own admission, the stats on drops are bugged so that they rollover – become worse than they should be when they're spawned – and thus the progression is more restrictive than it was ever intended to be. And indeed, DLC was released to try and get around that too. But DLC can't fix a fundamentally broken game, and in fact, it actually broke it more, because the loot coming out of it was too god, so it came out gimped, per that bug.\n\nIt is actually to the point where, in order to maximize your chances of getting loot that will give you better stats, and thus, help you move forward, an X-Box controller emulator was devised in order to take advantage of splitscreen. This is so you can have four chances at a map's rewards, rather than just the one, for your thirty minute run of what-the-hell-ever map. And I expect that this tool was only ever intended for the obsessive munchkin crowd, but it rapidly turned into a requirement to proceed at all in the game.\n\nThis is not tower defense. This is just farming and reaping the rewards of poor soil.\n\nSo, now that you understand what a majority of Dungeon Defenders is, I want you to take a look at the Most Helpful (All Time) reviews here on Steam for this game. Most of them are from people with people whose hours number in the multiple thousands. I hope that at least explaining the arbitrary farming puts into context those hours.\n\nDungeon Defenders, even with all its DLC, does not have nearly enough content to justify those lengths of time, or, hell, even my own, and by its own design, it's not a game I could recommend to anyone.\n\nIt's a bad game.","September 25, 2015","false","974.5"," 385 of 640 people (60%) found this review helpful 102 people found this review funny","60","385","640","102","19"

It becomes less of a game about having fun with tower defense and more about min-maxing stats while simultaneously avoiding cheaters who mess up your characters and possessive teammates who think they have the "optimal placement" and will sell your towers with wild abandon.\n\nIt was such a fun game while I played but after a certain point things just got worse and I stopped having fun.

The game is fun enough when played alone, but really shines when you grab 3 friends with you and experience the unique possibilities and synergies of the classes.\n\nThe gameplay varies quite a lot from character to character, from the Apprentice that offers you basic tower defense gameplay to the Summoner (DLC) that plays more like an RTS. The vast variety of the gameplay styles of the characters and the RPG elements, such as leveling up your character and collecting better gear, offer great reply value. Many of the DLCs offer additional content that adds to the value of the game and thus buying the entire bundle is the most cost efficient way to get the best experience.\n\nDungeon Defenders brings a more unique variant of the Tower Defense genre to the table, which makes it a great purchase for someone looking for a good co-op game and any fan of said genre.","December 2, 2013","true","9.1"," 28 of 43 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","28","43","0","3"

It was the f***ing greatest game in my 11 year old mind. Then someone gave me a hacked weapon, and the game changed.\n\nSo, I started hacking myself.

I boosted people up, leveled them up, finished the game Nightmare Hardcore with random people, because I thought I was being nice.\n\nEh, then the plague of being bored came again.\n\nOne day I booted it up, just to see my trophies, and have my pride of an 11 year old.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/65800/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","Magic towers? Check. Defensive auras? Check. Bombs? Check. Barriers? Check. Huge weapons? Check. Hordes of monsters waiting patiently behind strategically placed doors until players are ready? Check! Action RPG and tower defence hybrid Dungeon Defenders brings all those things to the table, plus more. It may not be the sharpest looking, musically creative, or thoughtful game out there, but it makes up for all of that by just being a lot of fun.\n\nLeaving their kids behind, the four legendary heroes of Etheria have set out to vanquish evil, loot caves and, if they're like most heroes, probably spend a fair bit of time in the local tavern. Their children, who had been content to stay behind and dream of adventure, accidently unleash an ancient power and soon find their castle surrounded by monsters. Crazy kids. True to their heritage, the young warriors take up their weapons and prepare to defend their home. The story is cute, but aside from a few brief cutscenes, largely irrelevant.\n\nThe premise of Dungeon Defenders is simple: protect your crystal against hordes of monsters by building towers. There are four classes you can choose to play: the apprentice, who summons magic-shooting towers; the squire, who builds fortifications and medieval-style weaponry; the huntress, who lays traps and snares; and the monk, who can create auras to aid friends and hinder foes. Each class is diverse in their skills and abilities, and can be further customised each time they level up by assigning points to them, their towers, or both. In addition, there is a plethora of loot dropped each level that can give your heroes an edge in a fight. Even pets can be obtained to help you out!\n\nAs you level up, new skill points are not your only advantage. All fortifications you build require mana for construction, which you can collect from treasure chests or fallen foes. Each time you level up, your maximum mana capacity increases. This allows you to store mana for repairs, upgrades and special class skills. Unfortunately, not all classes are created equal. As a team of four, the apprentice, squire, huntress and monk are a near unstoppable force of perfect complementary skills. Working individually, however, is a far different story. The apprentice and squire can hold their own, but if you prefer to play solo, you can say goodbye to much success with either the huntress or monk.\n\nThere are 13 campaign maps in total (plus more through paid DLC), and each requires a new strategy. Early maps tend to have few chokepoints and only one crystal to defend, while later maps are a veritable maze of potential enemy paths, and may have up to four separate crystals. Maps can support up to four players (six on some of the DLC maps), and enemy health is scaled accordingly. As a result, you can tackle missions alone or online with friends and enjoy a challenge either way.\n\nEach set of maps has a unique feel. There are maps set inside servants' quarters, the throne room and the forge, while later challenges take you outside to the gardens or onto the roof. The cartoony, cel-shaded graphics are a delight and suit the light tone of the game well. Bright green gardens on one map are an excellent contrast to the dreary, rain-splattered turrets of another, and the diverse designs really set the maps apart from one another. Character faces look a little odd, but heroes are otherwise equally attractive; especially the apprentice, whose face is hidden beneath his pointy wizard hat. Unfortunately, different genders for each hero are only available as paid DLC. Bummer.\n\nBetween maps, you return to your own special tavern, in which you can buy and sell equipment, organise your inventory or admire any achievements you earned, which take physical form as trophies. You visit the tavern of whoever is hosting the current game, which means you can show off to your friends, too! A word of warning though: in-game trophies can be earned in any mode, but achievements can only be completed through ranked online play. Annoying, but a necessary precaution considering the game is open to modding in offline or non-ranked play.\n\nClearing all maps on medium takes around 15 hours, but there are three harder difficulties available (Hard, Insane, and Nightmare), complete with more powerful loot. Extra challenges are provided that mix things up too, such as a map where the crystal changes locations or where roles are reversed and you go on the attack. Many of these require multiple players though, so it's far more enjoyable if you can play with your friends.\n\nOnline play functions amiably, but some further polish would have been beneficial. Joining or creating a game is easy enough, but at higher levels, I was often kicked the second I set foot into a game without explanation. Unlike many other multiplayer games, there is no voting system to kick people, so if one person has a problem with you, you're gone. There's no loot designation system either, so it's a free-for-all on the best drops. That said, most players are relatively blasé about gear and leave it alone to be auto-sold at the end of the round. On the bright side, the game natively supports voice chat.\n\nI may have initially been disappointed by the focus on online play, but these fears quickly passed as I discovered what an enjoyable game Dungeon Defenders is. 13 maps with 15-20 hours of play is a considerable amount of initial content, but the extra challenges and loot-hunting are what will keep you coming back. Working out strategies and tower placement is a great fun, and finally succeeding in your strategy is immensely satisfying. Some of the online features are a little rough, but if you enjoy a good tower defence game, then you should not miss this one.\n\nHighly Recommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","November 8, 2014","true","30.8"," 31 of 50 people (62%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","62","31","50","4","0"

Ever since the Starcraft & Warcraft III (Cube Defense) days these kinds of titles have been able to deliver a lot of depth and strategy for relatively simple mechanics. Sadly, Dungeon Defenders failed in most of those aspects and felt a lot more like a cheap iPad knockoff of a good game.  The game has an arbitrary item drop system that constantly requires futzing with upgrades and switching between weapons - the RPGness of this title was disappointing to say the least. No tower mazing. Uninteresting weapons. Repetitive gameplay. Worst of all is the autoaim feature, which redirects shots in completely unanticipated ways - no option or mod exists to disable (WHY?). The game runs on the Unreal Engine 3, and it does look nice, so there's that. Play Sanctum 2 for a much better executed TD in a similar theme. If you want something hardcore just skip to Defense Grid for a proper TD. 4/10 for a very mediocre tower defense title.","January 25, 2014","false","8.4"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","16","23","0","3"

You control your hero, selected from 4 different types (or more, we'll get into that) and defend the Eternia Crystals using both an assortment of weapons and summoned magical defences.\nThere are wizards that summon elemental towers, knights that summon medieval fortifications and siege weapons, monks that work with auras and hunters that employ traps.\nAll of these feel different and entertaining, and for a first impression this game made a great one.\nThe further you get from this core gameplay though, the bleaker things start to look.\n\nYour hero levels up by defeating enemies and surviving waves (or rather, having the crystal survive waves. Your hero just respawns if he/she dies), and gets a skill point or two to invest into either personal statistics like health or damage or choose to increase similar values on their summoned defences. This means that you have to choose how to balance things between your hero and your defences.\nHigher levels will also unlock access to better (randomly generated, typical RPG fare) loot, new defences and 2 special skills.\n\nSpare mana from levels, which is there used to summon, repair and upgrade defences, heal the player and use special skills, is given to the player and is then used to buy items from the shop in the tavern (hub level) or upgrade existing items. Both of these take a ton of mana, far more than you'll get just by progressing through the game normally. You'll need to grind a lot to afford your first pet, or max out even the shoddy level 1 gloves you're likely to have picked up during the opening level.\n\nThen there are 25 pieces of DLC for this game, total value ~5x times the cost of the base game that add new levels, new costumes and new heroes (some actually new ones but mostly gender-swapped reskins of the original 4 classes).\nThere are three modes of playing this game, locally, online using the Steam system and 'Ranked' using Trendy's own in-house system. Ranked is the only way to earn achievements, and is completely separate from the rest of the game (characters, campaign progress, even camera settings) which pretty much negates all the neat Steam workshop stuff that's out there since everybody is playing Ranked instead.\n\nI first bought and played this game on XBox Live Arcade, which was almost entirely neglected by the development team. Not only did they not get most of the DLC, they were also passed over on actual game updates, including patches and bug fixes. For example, to this day the first Apprentice tower has a hard cap on its firing speed that makes it utterly useless for higher level players.\n\nMore recently a semi-sequel came out, Dungeon Defenders Eternity, which repackaged all of the original content into a shiny new package... and expected people to just buy it again. Worse yet, that game has since been abandoned and just half-heartedly (and looking at the community comments, also just incompletely) compensated the disappointed players by giving them a free copy of Dungeon Defenders.\n\nI don't normally bother with things like that in a review, but their business practices really are abysmal, and the game would need to be a hell of a lot better for me to excuse them.\nSo now there's an Early Access sequel in the works, which looks to add even more weird design choices and problems and I'm just done with all of it.\nWhatever is going wrong at Trendy Entertainment is going very wrong and I recommend everybody that will listen to watch it from a safe distance and not buy their games, including this one.\n\nMaybe get Defender's Quest instead, since that's also a tower defence rpg hybrid and it's actually good","May 13, 2015","false","10.5"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","2"

All I learned was that the game doesn't really have much depth to it and how I couldn't understand why it had so many good reviews.\n\nThe graphics are nice and colorful but the character models themselves look sort of ugly. Each class has their own unique sort of defenses though there are things I really don't understand about the game. One being some of the dlc characters, you've got some that are just the same characters that were already in the game except different gender... I didn't think the other dlc characters were that good either, the jester just lays ''presents'' around which are just random defenses, there's also the robot character which I thought was ok but the berserker might be the worst, he gets no defenses, he's just a melee oriented character and the best thing about this game is setting up your defenses while the melee is incredibly simplistic and not very good. The melee mostly revolves around holding down left click.\n\nSome people complain about the grinding but grinding wouldn't be bad if it were actually fun, in this game it isn't because of how repetitive it is and also when u make a character u can see the defenses u'll be able to use if u reach a certain level and there's five or so of them. I thought ''ok, so maybe new defenses will become available to me the longer I play'' but I was dead wrong, u use the same 5 the entire game and u can get to a rly high level above 60 I think so that's all that time grinding with the same 5 defenses the whole time, a severe lack in customization. I was expecting a good game but in the end I was disappointed.\n\nYou also shouldn't bother with this game at all unless you have friends that are willing to play since this game is incredibly boring in single player and lots of random people whom you try to join will kick you out for no reason.","December 27, 2013","false","9.6"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jstq/recommended/65800/","jstq","JSTQ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jstq/","76 products in account","This game is good while you dont hit the 'mythical floor', where you need to grind for good mythical gear to be able to grind transcendent gear to be able to grind supreme and ultimate gear. This grind could be fine for someone, until you discover that all good gear is probably hacked even on ranked steam server. All top results for every map is hacked, crazy gear is hacked/duped, cubes is massively duped, mana is hacked. Any 10 year kid's pc knowledge is enough to make mana infinite, to make insane items, etc. This game could be good if u just isolate yourself from rest of the hacked world, maybe with your friends, and just play from scratch till 70-s. Then the grind part starts, which is very-very VERY boring. You have to waste 2-3 hours to beat survival level to be able to find some mythical gear to be able to beat tavern defense level to be able to level so you can grind new levels to be able to grind...\n\nAchievements system is fine, it makes at least a little bit point to grind levels and gear, but nothing else.\n\nGraphics is a mess, cell-shading outlines looks like piece of shiТ (basically looks like LoL, which is also piece of shiТ, but even worse), massive special effects make your head sick, area of effect weapons is just impossible to watch. I just switch my monitor to white and black mode sometimes to play this game. Yeah. Its really, really sucks. If your pet hits with elemental damage, or your weapon is area of effect hit, you just cant see anything sometimes because of this explosions of whatever effect is.\n\nDLC-s is complete p2w madness. Half of them is absolutely required for beating game on nightmare difficulty (which is locked by the way, you need another DLC set to unlock it).\nEternia shards DLC set costs the most and the most important part of DLC's. Without it the nightmare mode is locked, the only place you can start grind some nice gear and experience. Absolutely required.\nSeries EV hero DLC is so overpowered that she can just do levels on insane difficulty from level one. Tower buff is completely overpowered and REQUIRED to any levels on nightmare.\nSummoner uses completely separate defense units which is called summon units, and has pretty overpowered defenses too, that also is required later. You CAN_NOT beat almost any levels on nightmare without this two heroes.\nBarbarian is one of the top dps heroes in game and he is required for some of the hardest maps in game to take down boss quickly.\nJester is pretty weak compared to ev or summoner, but she still can be pretty op builder and good ranged dps hero. Also move tower ability sometimes helps.\nTavern defense (anniversary pack DLC i believe?) is required for leveling and has insane pet as reward for beating it on a nightmare survival.\nEV lab is required for getting massive amount of insane accessories that you... get ready... CAN NOT GET ANYWHERE IN THE GAME EXCEPT ON THIS DLC, surprise! Also, it gives insane ultimate weapons on regular basis, crazy stats armor, lots of trans armor, sometimes even ult++ armor.\nNew heroes DLC is required because this female hero versions have more movements speed so they are pretty much standard for builder hero.\nTalay mining complex DLC gives insane rewards for survival again (pet rock i believe?).\nSome Christmas map DLC gives you coal for beating it, which i believe if u have 100 of them (grinded or ... duped again), you can combine them to get the most insane pet in the game (all this pets is hacked if u find any for trade).\nI hope you get the point. If you want to really grind this game and spend lots of time on it, this P2W DLC is absolutely required.\n\nI dont recommend this game for almost everyone. However, if you and your friends desperate to find any co-op game to play, you might try this.

Worth catching while on sale. Fun to play with friends.\n\nThe under-advertised feature of being able to do local drop-in and drop out co-op with up to four players is a GREAT feature... and one I didn't even know was possible until someone mentioned it in game. You can utilize this with both offline AND online play. It's also a great way to power-level your own characters! Have a big bad level 80+ and you want to get a different class up in level and gear quickly? Plug in a Xbox 360 or Xbox One controller, hit start, and let them idle on a hard map you've mastered a defense build for.... Maybe even slap a rubber band on the shoot button, and let the game's auto-targeting hit anything somewhat in front of your lowbie. (The game seems to auto-target assist with a control pad by default... though not with a mouse and keyboard.)\n\nThe story isn't particularly great, though it is a nice touch. Once you figure out the "trick," many of the maps are pretty easy (though figuring out the best way to utilize your limited points for building defenses is one of my favorite aspects of the game.)\n\nUnfortunately, there are points in the game where you will likely hit a gear curve, forcing you to repetatively grind a previously beaten map on increasingly harder difficulty settings to unlock better gear. Later levels and especially the expansion can be VERY challenging on "nightmare" difficulty. Or, you can look around at other player's shops and try to find some gear to buy. (Sadly, most players GROSSLY overprice the gear in their personal shops.)\n\nThe ability to unlock and select difficulty levels for maps is a definate plus. The 6 hero types (I'm not counting the mostly the same gender "alternatives") allow for different approaches to the maps, though true master builders will learn to combine the tower / defense types to really clobber harder levels and higher difficulty settings (a small hint: BUFF BEAM).\n\nI spent a ton of time in this game and originally caught it a long time ago for like $5. It's been one the best game purchases I've made in terms of value alone. It's a pretty fun little game to boot.

Dungeon Defenders is one of the best action-tower defense games I have played. The gameplay is much like other games in the genre - progress through a series of levels in which your goal is to defend a crystal. The catch is the crystal is under attack by waves of enemies. Between waves you have the opportunity to set up defenses (different types are available depending on which of the 4 characters you use). Once a wave starts, it's you and your defense versus the horde... rinse and repeat. So what sets DD apart? Well, one cool thing is that you create and play as a personalized character that can be saved. Your character levels up via experience gained and can be equipped with hundreds of different weapons that are found during levels. Add in an excellent online co-op mode, tons of extra challenges and DLC, and you've got a damn near perfect package.

It is not just your average defense oriented game. Especially when playing by yourself it gets to be pretty challenging to where everyone is coming from everywhere and you can only be at one place at a time. Its fun, addictive, strategical, and just awesome. It is definitely worth the 15$. I would recommend it to anyone that likes a little challenge, or even a lot of challenge. There is such a variety of everything that is available. Every class is different in the play style and uses. Every class is going to have a different set up of blockade/towers. The designs are very well done and the level designs are fantastic. The laning is very simple, but still requires thought in where to put towers and blockades along the way.\nOne thing I do have to say about this that never really is established with info, Steam Achievements are only availible by doing the Trendy Ranked servers. You will not be able to earn them on Local play or Open play. I realized that after getting some in game achievements and not getting any Steam achievements.","February 12, 2014","true","5.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

As a co-op game, it's fun and mindless. But as an actual strategy game, it's very poor. If you like loot grinds, you may adore this game, because it delivers trivially-incremental weapon and armor upgrades for hours and hours. But if you're the type of person who recognizes a time-suck for what it is, you will run out of entertainment in this title after about 4 hours of each character class you try.\n\nAlso, the UI is awful. The best combination seems to be: gameplay with KBM, and manage your character and inventory with a controller. But neither is perfect. Gameplay with KBM works pretty well, especially once you learn the hotkeys, but all text and menus are blown up HUGE on screen, obscuring the game ... a hallmark of a mediocre port from the land of consoles.\n\nProceed with low expectations.","December 10, 2011","true","6.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Awesome game over all.\n\nThe game is great for at least 40 hours of game play if not more even if you aren't being obessive about upgrades and loot drops.  I ended up playing this single player a great deal of time when I first got it and even before I burned out I played mostly single player, that being said it's great fun to get a group of friends together and run over hoards of goblins and making strategies that fail, bearly work, or are overly powerful.  Expirmentation and variation are great.\n\nThe early game and mid game are great for casual gamers.  Some thing to pick up and go.  Hammer out the easy/normal/hard difficulties for fun, leveling up characters and weapons has a fairly decent curve and is enjoyable for most skill levels.  It can be a heck of a challenge for those who try to jump into hard content from a low level or a smooth ride for those who just progress naturally.\n\nThe late game is a bit tedious... I'm talking after you beat the normal difficulties and normal maps.  When you get into the advanced content it gets to be a giant pain in the butt to grind for good weapons and armor, trading is a nightmare and the amount of mana to upgrade anything is absolutly insane.  Playing with people at the higher levels is also very aggrivating.  The late game was designed to be very hard, and it is.  It's also for only for the stout hearted.\n\nAll of that being said I highly recommend picking up this game on sale or not.  If you like tower defense or hack n' slash you'll probably like this game.  The late game shouldn't put you off because you can easily put in 40 hours or more before you get to late game content if you're just looking for a game to enjoy.","December 24, 2013","true","432.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

A beta has just recently been released, and I was looking foward to trying it. When I took the steps to use it, then opened the game, the features remained the same as the previous update. And yes, I went through all the steps to properly install betas.\n\n• Incredible lag.

I have sunk countless hours into this game (I lied.. steam counted 737..) and it has provided me with hours of fun, a great community and a lot of interesting gameplay. The game itself is a 3rd person tower defence game with an rpg element to it. Your hero levels up and gets new items that drop from the monsters you kill. The loot is randomly generated which in itself has a good and a bad side. The good side being BAJILLIONS of armor/weapon variants. The down side is that getting good quality loot and more importantly loot that you need and are looking for is very difficult, especially when you get to the higher rarity armor and weapon types. This can make the game very grindy and if doing levels over and over again, perfecting your layout and gameplan isn't for you then Dungeon Defenders isn't for you, at least not if you want to be the very best like no one ever was..\n\nThat being said there are a lot of levels, challenges, maps and various modes to play giving the game enough variety and interesting gameplay to warrent anyone playing it for the price. There are some big flaws with the game. The prime of these boil down to two things; There is a lot of DLC, and I do mean a lot of it, and the game is very easy to hack. Now the DLC aspect of the game isn't too terrible. There is a lot of it but a lot of it is cosmetic and almost all of them are cheap. Now the hacking is an actual problem. The game is very easy to hack and hence hackers are prominent in the community, even in the online play. Trendy tries to monitor and ban hackers but it is a bit out of their control. If you are the kind of person who likes to play by themselves (which you totally can) then this won't affect you at all. If you want to play online with others then I suggest using the forums and getting to know a few people who play the game (or get your friends to play with you). Having people you regularly play with ensures a nicer experience then trying to adapt to pub games and risk having your experience ruined by hackers.\n\nWith all this in mind I still feel like Dungeon Defenders was a great purchase and a great experience. I would recommend it to anyone if for nothing else just to play through the story and see the interesting gameplay it provides. This game is old however and the sequal is on its way so perhaps holding off for that may be a better idea if you don't plan on getting into this game hardcore.","December 7, 2013","true","737.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","2"

I know I'm a bit demanding but I'm not the only players disturbed by the DLCs.","April 2, 2014","true","34.5"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I've spent hours and days in this game and still I'm not on maximum level and with the best EQ. Don't worry about too much DLCs. If you have friend who have these maps he can host for you and you can play together! Also you can make all achievements without DLCs! That's awesome! If you have friends who have this game play together and help each other! It's endless FUN! I would recommend this game to you!\n\n#CZECH\nÚžasná tower defense pařba na které jsem strávil hodiny a dny a stále nejsem na maximu svého vybavení. Hodně DLC? Vůbec nevadí. DLC mapy jsou Vám přístupné pokud je Váš kamarád hostuje. Což je skvělá věc! Další velké plus mají u mě achievementy. Můžete je získat všechny bez jakéhékoliv DLC a relativně snadno (samozřejmě musíte mít dobré postavy nebo kamarády co budou stavět).

I like to play as the monk lee sin. His special tower are energy field that either deals damage over time or slow, weakens or put salts on the enemy. There are also Vayne, Veigar  and Garen as playable characters. Garen is a knight that uses medieval technology to rekt his enemies. vaynes use trap and veigar uses dark gypsie magic. Overall I give this game a 10 out of 10 out of 10  because the graphic is beautiful in it's own way. The uhh, only thing that I don't like about the game is that the storyline kinda suck and it's not very rewarding. like -spoiler alert- After you kill the evil dragon alduin the heroes just look off into the distance and I was like "What the hell are they looking at? their dead mentors?" because that was the most anti climatic ends ever.

Constant New Content...Need Anything Else?\n\nBest way I can describe it is that a 3rd person shooter and a tower defense game mixed into one amazing game. You set up defense towers, while you also run around and kill goblins yourself. Each class has their own towers/traps and weapons, a variety team makes the difference. Solo this game is ok, but playing with people online or, better yet, your friends makes this one game I can't stop playing. So much DLC it gets costly to get it all, but it is money well spent on a game like this.\n\nPros:\n+Game-play\n+Group play\n+A lot of new content (now that DD2 is coming out, I expect it to stop adding to this game)\n+Many characters and missions\n+Level designs\n+Can set up a shop to sell equipment and pets\n+Lots of Achievements\n\nCons:\n-Solo play\n-Can get repetitive at times (especially playing solo)\n-There can be glitches (goblin stuck in wall and mage hiding in door for example, however game will kill them after a couple minutes)\n\nSo-So:\n=Graphics (they are good, but not amazing)","August 3, 2012","true","289.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Beat the campaign, started another char class to do it again, discovered that your solo chars can't be used multiplayer for some reason, started over again, got bored, etc.  It's a fine little action TD game, nothing seriously wrong with it.  I'm just not sure a game like that needs randomized loot drops and crafting and all this other stuff.  There's also a disappointing lack of variety in enemies.  By the time you get a few levels in (and there are a decent number of those), you've pretty much seen everything that's on offer.  The extra classes are good, but I don't think they differentiate from each other enough.  Plus, each one has only a handful of different towers you can make..","August 27, 2014","true","20.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Dungeon Defenders is a choice game:) Recommend? Certainly yes. If hybrid hack and slash /tower defense is your thing then this is for you. If its not, get it any way. You'll still have a blast, especially if you play with mates. I, and everyone I have played with, have had a lot of fun with this game.\n\nThe following is a list of what I consider pros, cons, and things I am on the fence about . Pros being things i liked (of course), cons being things that annoy me, and 'on the fence' being things that are kinda  'hmmm...yeah, mehh' but not enough to sway my opinion of the game. And yes, my opinion is subjective:) Here we go:\n\nPros:\n* Multiple characters to choose from with distinct abilities. Allows for a variety of play styles. You'll find a character who has a play style that you like and feel 'at home' with.\n* Frequent character 'level ups'. Creates a good sense of character progression and hey,  we all love becoming more awesome:)\n*'Level Ups' are well balanced. 'Level ups' on both equipment and characters feel like they are a real choice that impacts your play. But not game changing enough that you 'gimp' your characters with one poor choice.\n* Insane number of loot drops. Even with multiple characters, no one is ever stuck for equipment.\n*Four player co-op...c'mon, who doesn't love that?!!\n*Local split-screen co-op.  Local co-op is a feature that is missing from way too many game nowadays. Its awesome to have this feature available.\n*Levels have a nice varitey of design layouts, encouraging you to employ different strategies. You'll find tactics that work for you no matter what level you are on, but you don't feel like you do the exact same thing for every level.\n* Awesome amount of DLC for those who want to keep the game going a bit longer:)\n*Being able to change which of your characters you use ingame enables you to play solo if you want to, and you never feel like you are stuck without the defenses you might need.\n*Controller support. Having a choice to use controller or keyboard and mouse is great. Both have strong groups of supporters, and its great to have the option that suits your preference.\n\nCons:\n* Rather 'busy' visuals. Hellooo cataracts:)) (kidding). But, the very bright colors, and numbers and icons that constantly appear on screen can be a bit much on the eyes for some. I got used to it, but at first i wasn't sure i ever would.\n* enemies have variety, but they lack character. It's hard to pinpoint why i feel this way, because I think it stems from a combination of things.  I hesitate to compare games in a review, but the humorous commentary and cocky swagger of the orcs in Orcs Must Die [by Robot Entertainment] gave the enemies a degree of life that is missing from the enemies in Dungeon Defenders. Also, the slower pacing of the enemies can make you feel like they don't have a sense of urgency. I never really felt that they wanted to destroy that crystal more than anything else in the world.\n\n\nOn the fence:\n* Kinda slow pacing. I know I brought up the pacing thing in the cons regarding enemy character, but this element of the pacing regards a different aspect of the game. Everything, from your character to the enemies, seems to plod along quite dreamily. For new players, this can be great, so you have time to react. For more experienced gamers it can be a little frustrating at times.  I can imagine some people dumping loads of 'level up' points into their character just to get him or her to run around a little faster:)\n* Local co-op players share loot and currency. For some, its a true chance to cooperate, or it creates a friendly rivalry for cash, and for others a frustrating race to see who can spend the cash to level up weapons and armor first. It depends on who you play with:)) Choose your allies wisely:)\n* Story line is almost nonexistent and ultimately irrelevent. Yeah, if you want the story to pull you in and care about the ingame world and the related characters, this game is not for you.\n* Cartoony artstyle. Sometimes i like it and other times i wish it was a bit more...mature.\n\nThere we go, thats it. These are my thoughts on Dungeon Defenders. So, if after all these years you are still having trouble deciding whether you want to play it...I hope this review helps.\n\nCheers!\n\n","August 14, 2014","true","85.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Fun to play alone, or with others. I just wish more people got online and played!! Most people online are nice. A lot of kids, but that is expected. I noticed it's hard to join low level people's games with a high level character. Which is why more people need to play this game for a variety of players. I host games often because of gettiing kicked, and allow all level characters to join most of the time.\nPersonally, I think modified weapons are great if you want to breeze threw the maps or have a more relazing experience. I would not recommend always playing with these modified weapons, because it takes away from the excitement of this colorful and sometimes challenging game. Challenge games are fun... and well, challenging. I recommend playing on hard once you get the hang of the game, because it's the right amount of difficulty and enemies in my opinion. I love playing on Insane, but I've put a lot of hours in this small addicting game. I play started out playing with keyboard and mouse, but i like to use a controller now. Using a controller is easier once you figure out how to build towers.\nI recommend this game, but be careful not to get sucked in and spend a bunch of money. I hear it's very easy to do.","September 15, 2014","true","62.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Very fun way to handle the tower defense genre.  There is your standard mage with towers, but also interesting ideas like monk with damage/debuff bubbles, archer using traps for support type defense, and a tanky type knight using walls and ballista.  You can increase either your obstacles' effectiveness, your actual hero effectiveness, or a mix of the two.\n\nIt got too difficult to keep up with much of the harder content without getting some amazing gear, which was only obtainable very briefly via some hardcore exploitation.  By the time we got to that point in the content, there was no legit way to get the gear yourself without trading for exorbitant prices.  Was fun while it lasted, and definitely worth some time just to get through the original/non-DLC part of the game to level up and try it out.  Even more so if you've got a group of buddies.\n\nHave not played in a long time so some of the negative aspects may already be addressed by now, but at this point I'm not likely to return.","January 18, 2014","true","105.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

With some planing each stage thus far is easily beatable and can just as quickly turn around and go sour if your not watching things so it does keep you on your toes. Deffinatly more fun with friends than solo in my opinion.  The battles are fast not locking you and your friends into long drawn out play sessions.\n\nDISLIKES: Cant think of anthing right now.","June 26, 2014","true","47.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Thats the boring part out of the way.\n\nSo before you get into a game you have to close two chunks of shameless advertising. They want you to buy new characters even though all of them are new because you havn't got into the game yet. There are four free characters you can play which are: Apprentice, Squire, Huntress and Monk. Each of these have different traps such as the Apprentice having a lot of higher damage traps whereas the Squire mainly has blockades. The damage and health of course does depend on your armour, how you level up and whether you forge items to be better.\n\nThe character creation is basically what colour you want to be and your name. Pretty lame but the colour isnt as important as the gameplay.\n\nThe problem with the game for new players is you would just click "quick play" so you can jump right in. This will place you in a game with people similar to your level, except for the level 77 who has taken up all the trap space and all you can do is sit and sponge xp. This is the problem. Anyone of any level can join which has a huge effect on the gameplay, sometimes making you quit because you get bored.\n\nHowever persevering with the game pays off as you start to learn from other people telling you your traps suck and the level up system, that doesnt seem to require any kind of grinding. Basically it is hard to be bad at the game. Its a tower defence game. Place traps in the right place and then shoot the bad guys with your funky weapon that has symbols you have no clue about. If its green its good. That is pretty much the game right there.\n\nI just want to take a second to mention that annoying ingame voice bug. Good luck with push to talk. Most of the people won't be able to hear you if you do.\n\nThere are bosses in the game and you usually have to require doing a bunch of stuff like using electric rods of some sort, of course this is unless the level 77 doesn't go super saiyan 3 and one shot the boss. (And yes Sam if you are reading this I havn't watched it yet but I can still refrence it so keep your hair on)\n\nThe more you level up the stronger you become. You will be able to complete higher difficulties and get better gear. Along with this you kind of pass the new players and get in with the cool kids. These people suck. Im in games and they all agree to only take what you need. And im looking at items no one wants thinking, "You are wasting valuable mana here!" (Mana is the currency for traps and the forge system, which is pretty much an average upgrade system) So i wait untill the last five seconds then mash 'E' and hope no ones see's me.\n\nThe highest level is 100. Im currently at level 45 or so. This means i can't say what it's like with the tough kids as i'm still only in with the cool kids. But i'm under the impression it is just a bit more serious.\n\nSo the game may come off kind of bad here. I didn't exactly say it was perfect because it really isnt, and there isnt going to be a change either. However, the game is very fun. I really enjoy it because i am a big fan of tower defence games and Dungeon Defenders ticks all the boxes and goes further. The maps don't seem to get old and the players all working together makes the game feel more like an RP that other games. Also when you max out your character, you make another one and do that twice more before you have to give them more money. That isn't very good in my opinion as i did pay for the game but i don't mind because the amount of play time in those four characters is more than most tower defence games have in total.\n\nIm sorry if im confusing you or my sentances arn't the best but im very ungood at writing stuff. In conclusion, buy the game. It really is worth the money and with the second game coming out soon it would do you well to get a feel for how the game works so when Dungeon Defenders 2 is released you won't be kicked for being a scrub.","June 30, 2014","true","16.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Great tower defense game, the best one I've played in my life.\n\nYou'll start off rather slow, which is why you'll mainly want to bring along friends or get boosted by said friends. If you're still enjoying the game after a good while, chances are your experience will become a lot better as your opportunities begin to expand.\n\nThe game won't be offering you an alarming number of handouts. Expect long (and later on challenging) fights, as well as trial and error.\n\nUltimately, this game is a grindfest. If you're going to buy Dungeon Defenders with the goal to progress and grow mighty, then I STRONGLY recommend that you purchase the DLC's for this game as it grants you access to heroes which you'll hands down need to climb your way up as well as maps that contain the many items you'll be after eventually.","June 24, 2014","true","512.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Like some tower defense? well this game just might be for you. Its a hybrid crawler/tower defense (more in the tower defense side).Your the tower pretty much and you gotta set up some defenses and use your character to attack the mobs coming at you while defending.\n\nIt has different modes in it, one being pvp,pets which you can collect which help you and lvl up,and tons of different weapons for each character that mostly have different stats. A fun game to pick up when on sale or at full price.

Beat the campaign, started another char class to do it again, discovered that your solo chars can't be used multiplayer for some reason, started over again, got bored, etc.  It's a fine little action TD game, nothing seriously wrong with it.  I'm just not sure a game like that needs randomized loot drops and crafting and all this other stuff.  There's also a disappointing lack of variety in enemies.  By the time you get a few levels in (and there are a decent number of those), you've pretty much seen everything that's on offer.  The extra classes are good, but I don't think they differentiate from each other enough.

Dungeon Defenders is a choice game:) Recommend? Certainly yes. If hybrid hack and slash /tower defense is your thing then this is for you. If its not, get it any way. You'll still have a blast, especially if you play with mates. I, and everyone I have played with, have had a lot of fun with this game.\n\nThe following is a list of what I consider pros, cons, and things I am on the fence about . Pros being things i liked (of course), cons being things that annoy me, and 'on the fence' being things that are kinda  'hmmm...yeah, mehh' but not enough to sway my opinion of the game. And yes, my opinion is subjective:) Here we go:\n\nPros:\n* Multiple characters to choose from with distinct abilities. Allows for a variety of play styles. You'll find a character who has a play style that you like and feel 'at home' with.\n* Frequent character 'level ups'. Creates a good sense of character progression and hey,  we all love becoming more awesome:)\n*'Level Ups' are well balanced. 'Level ups' on both equipment and characters feel like they are a real choice that impacts your play. But not game changing enough that you 'gimp' your characters with one poor choice.\n* Insane number of loot drops. Even with multiple characters, no one is ever stuck for equipment.\n*Four player co-op...c'mon, who doesn't love that?!!\n*Local split-screen co-op.  Local co-op is a feature that is missing from way too many game nowadays. Its awesome to have this feature available.\n*Levels have a nice varitey of design layouts, encouraging you to employ different strategies. You'll find tactics that work for you no matter what level you are on, but you don't feel like you do the exact same thing for every level.\n* Awesome amount of DLC for those who want to keep the game going a bit longer:)\n*Being able to change which of your characters you use ingame enables you to play solo if you want to, and you never feel like you are stuck without the defenses you might need.\n*Controller support. Having a choice to use controller or keyboard and mouse is great. Both have strong groups of supporters, and its great to have the option that suits your preference.\n\nCons:\n* Rather 'busy' visuals. Hellooo cataracts:)) (kidding). But, the very bright colors, and numbers and icons that constantly appear on screen can be a bit much on the eyes for some. I got used to it, but at first i wasn't sure i ever would.\n* enemies have variety, but they lack character. It's hard to pinpoint why i feel this way, because I think it stems from a combination of things.  I hesitate to compare games in a review, but the humorous commentary and cocky swagger of the orcs in Orcs Must Die [by Robot Entertainment] gave the enemies a degree of life that is missing from the enemies in Dungeon Defenders. Also, the slower pacing of the enemies can make you feel like they don't have a sense of urgency. I never really felt that they wanted to destroy that crystal more than anything else in the world.\n\n\nOn the fence:\n* Kinda slow pacing. I know I brought up the pacing thing in the cons regarding enemy character, but this element of the pacing regards a different aspect of the game. Everything, from your character to the enemies, seems to plod along quite dreamily. For new players, this can be great, so you have time to react. For more experienced gamers it can be a little frustrating at times.  I can imagine some people dumping loads of 'level up' points into their character just to get him or her to run around a little faster:)\n* Local co-op players share loot and currency. For some, its a true chance to cooperate, or it creates a friendly rivalry for cash, and for others a frustrating race to see who can spend the cash to level up weapons and armor first. It depends on who you play with:)) Choose your allies wisely:)\n* Story line is almost nonexistent and ultimately irrelevent. Yeah, if you want the story to pull you in and care about the ingame world and the related characters, this game is not for you.\n* Cartoony artstyle. Sometimes i like it and other times i wish it was a bit more...mature.\n\nThere we go, thats it. These are my thoughts on Dungeon Defenders. So, if after all these years you are still having trouble deciding whether you want to play it...I hope this review helps.\n\nCheers!\n\n","August 14, 2014","true","85.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Someone who is more akin to setting up a line of defenses could pick the Apprentice (a very strong defensive structure class) and put their skills into making their defenses better. Someone who wants more action and wants to kill enemies themselves could pick the Huntress (fantastic dps class) and put their skills into making their character's stats better.\n\nAlthough you play the same missions a lot of times over, they manage to be dynamic with different difficulty levels, very unique classes, and the billions of possible equipment options.\n\nThe only major flaws I've encountered with this game are disconnections from the online play server and disconnections from hosts themselves; however, Trendy's been working hard to get this stuff fixed.\n\nThis game is amazing and I recommend it as a must buy.","October 26, 2011","true","97.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","5"

This game will likely have you totally absorbed into the fun and strategic world of DD. If you like hack 'n slash, and/or tower defence, then you will absolutely love this game.\n\n08/05/2014 EDIT:\n\nDungeon Defenders isn't quite what it used to be, as amazing as it is. What I mean is, the community isn't the same. I'm sure there'll be plenty to disagree, but various times I've tried for games, I've come up with very few. It's a shame, but I suppose all good things must come to an end, at least for me.\n\nI have some excellent memories of this game, and even with the online situation being somewhat less than it was, I still absolutely recommend it. The vast trading, all the trophies, enormous amount of gear to collect, the sheer amount of tactics and co-operation, ... there's just too much for me to possibly encapsulate in a few paragraphs of text.\n\nI don't play this game anymore, ... I don't really play much of anything anymore, but I do remember--just about--a few things that were negatives about this game:\n\n1. The community could sometimes be a bit harsh, but there were also more than enough friendly, helpful players, at least in my experience. Trading could be rough, but it was fun and rewarding, once I figured it all out.\n\n2. Unfortunately, there were quite a few hacked items floating around, which was an incredibly disheartening thing for me. I was disgusted when I "got" my very first hacked sword, ... I was completely oblivious, thinking it was just really cool, ... although my Spidey senses were tingling, I guess I just didn't want to believe it, until people happily pointed it out. I dumped the sword and was quite peed off. Still, I didn't find it to be TOO excessive, such as in Torchlight II, in which I just found no sense of achievement, amongst people that are basically God. I like to share my accomplishments and yes, I can be competative, so cheaters with online games like this are a negative for me.\n\n3. Performance, even on a powerful rig, was a problem, pretty much down to the game itself, not a hardware thing. Still, the game runs well, the last few times I launched it and tested split-screen on King's Game, something that used to lag like a ♥♥♥♥♥. I'm quite pleased with the performance, nowadays, but I still think it's not very good, I guess I just got used to it. An oversight worth, ... looking over.\n\nIf it's still anything like I remember, and it's your kind of genre, then definitely get it.\n\nNOTE: I'd avoid this game like the plague, if you only have Linux, as it simply doesn't work properly on it. Google "can't collect gems on Dungeon Defenders Linux" or something to that effect, and you'll see why it's basically unplayable.\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask. It has been a long time, but I still remember bits and pieces.","December 31, 2012","true","302.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a very colorful game with cartoonish graphics which creates a fun environment that will attract a larger demographic of gamers. Overall its a solid game with some entertaining gameplay and good extras.","November 28, 2011","true","6.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game will likely have you totally absorbed into the fun and strategic world of DD. If you like hack 'n slash, and/or tower defence, then you will absolutely love this game.\n\n08/05/2014 EDIT:\n\nDungeon Defenders isn't quite what it used to be, as amazing as it is. What I mean is, the community isn't the same. I'm sure there'll be plenty to disagree, but various times I've tried for games, I've come up with very few. It's a shame, but I suppose all good things must come to an end, at least for me.\n\nI have some excellent memories of this game, and even with the online situation being somewhat less than it was, I still absolutely recommend it. The vast trading, all the trophies, enormous amount of gear to collect, the sheer amount of tactics and co-operation, ... there's just too much for me to possibly encapsulate in a few paragraphs of text.\n\nI don't play this game anymore, ... I don't really play much of anything anymore, but I do remember--just about--a few things that were negatives about this game:\n\n1. The community could sometimes be a bit harsh, but there were also more than enough friendly, helpful players, at least in my experience. Trading could be rough, but it was fun and rewarding, once I figured it all out.\n\n2. Unfortunately, there were quite a few hacked items floating around, which was an incredibly disheartening thing for me. I was disgusted when I "got" my very first hacked sword, ... I was completely oblivious, thinking it was just really cool, ... although my Spidey senses were tingling, I guess I just didn't want to believe it, until people happily pointed it out. I dumped the sword and was quite peed off. Still, I didn't find it to be TOO excessive, such as in Torchlight II, in which I just found no sense of achievement, amongst people that are basically God. I like to share my accomplishments and yes, I can be competative, so cheaters with online games like this are a negative for me.\n\n3. Performance, even on a powerful rig, was a problem, pretty much down to the game itself, not a hardware thing. Still, the game runs well, the last few times I launched it and tested split-screen on King's Game, something that used to lag like a ♥♥♥♥♥. I'm quite pleased with the performance, nowadays, but I still think it's not very good, I guess I just got used to it. An oversight worth, ... looking over.\n\nIf it's still anything like I remember, and it's your kind of genre, then definitely get it.\n\nNOTE: I'd avoid this game like the plague, if you only have Linux, as it simply doesn't work properly on it. Google "can't collect gems on Dungeon Defenders Linux" or something to that effect, and you'll see why it's basically unplayable.\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask. It has been a long time, but I still remember bits and pieces.","December 31, 2012","true","302.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Great tower defense game, the best one I've played in my life.\n\nYou'll start off rather slow, which is why you'll mainly want to bring along friends or get boosted by said friends. If you're still enjoying the game after a good while, chances are your experience will become a lot better as your opportunities begin to expand.\n\nThe game won't be offering you an alarming number of handouts. Expect long (and later on challenging) fights, as well as trial and error.\n\nUltimately, this game is a grindfest. If you're going to buy Dungeon Defenders with the goal to progress and grow mighty, then I STRONGLY recommend that you purchase the DLC's for this game as it grants you access to heroes which you'll hands down need to climb your way up as well as maps that contain the many items you'll be after eventually.","June 24, 2014","true","512.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If they had stopped there, the game would have been insanely popular.\n\nBut they started releasing tons of 'tweaks' that changed things by (usually) 30-40%.  Changes on such a scale are a bad idea, and quickly unbalanced everything.  Months later, the changes now seem to be fairly stable...  If it weren't for all the DLC.\n\nSee, the DLC tends to add further unbalancing changes.  And the cycle continues, over and over.\n\nBuy this game for the original content, and try not to be disturbed by the changes.  It's immensely fun.\n\nAnd if you buy the DLC, expect it to be horribly unbalanced.\n\nAlso, bring friends, or play solo.  PUGs in this game are the worst ever.","December 27, 2011","true","831.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you have a craving to farm for good loot, there's plenty of it to be had with this game. The biggest drawback I've found is the difficulty curve. Easy, Medium, Hard and Insane are easy enough to do through the core campaign but if you want to tackle Nightmare, you'll have to do a lot of farming for much better equipment as well as grinding experience to get to a level where you can actually equip such gear, otherwise you'll end up being a burden to your team in the "endgame" maps. If you get into it, be sure to get some friends down the road because it can get pretty boring playing solo. Overall, I find it to be a pretty enjoyable and addicting game and I'm glad I picked it up on the cheap thanks to the Humble Bundle!","March 22, 2013","true","288.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Dozens of different maps, many different classes to play (Four come standard, the rest is DLC) and each of them has it's own niche role. Weapons come in many shapes and forms and are fully upgradable.\n\nThe community here is relatively non-communicative, but even without communication there are some really cool people. Today I started an Apprentice, and after getting him to a basic level in single player, went to do a MP campaign on Hard difficulty. Then suddenly a level 100 Sorcerer named Dumbledore joined the game and carried me through the entire thing. At the end I was level 56. I find it quite amazing that a principal can find the time to run a school, and still help aspiring sorcerers with their levelling.\n\nAll in all the levelling is not grindy, and the characters are all cool in their own way, except the Jester, who seems to poop out ogres with 100k HP in Easy difficulty games where  it will squash all the sub-level 30 players in it's path since their DPS does not even break a thousand.

Thus increasing replay value because you'll want to go back and play as new people with different defences and strategies.\n\nIn fact, I want to finish this review up so I can go back and continue playing. If you get the regular verison you'll have a blast, but I can't express how much content the collector's edition truly has and for only $10 during steam sales, that's the way to go.\n\nAnyways Happy Gaming.

Thats the boring part out of the way.\n\nSo before you get into a game you have to close two chunks of shameless advertising. They want you to buy new characters even though all of them are new because you havn't got into the game yet. There are four free characters you can play which are: Apprentice, Squire, Huntress and Monk. Each of these have different traps such as the Apprentice having a lot of higher damage traps whereas the Squire mainly has blockades. The damage and health of course does depend on your armour, how you level up and whether you forge items to be better.\n\nThe character creation is basically what colour you want to be and your name. Pretty lame but the colour isnt as important as the gameplay.\n\nThe problem with the game for new players is you would just click "quick play" so you can jump right in. This will place you in a game with people similar to your level, except for the level 77 who has taken up all the trap space and all you can do is sit and sponge xp. This is the problem. Anyone of any level can join which has a huge effect on the gameplay, sometimes making you quit because you get bored.\n\nHowever persevering with the game pays off as you start to learn from other people telling you your traps suck and the level up system, that doesnt seem to require any kind of grinding. Basically it is hard to be bad at the game. Its a tower defence game. Place traps in the right place and then shoot the bad guys with your funky weapon that has symbols you have no clue about. If its green its good. That is pretty much the game right there.\n\nI just want to take a second to mention that annoying ingame voice bug. Good luck with push to talk. Most of the people won't be able to hear you if you do.\n\nThere are bosses in the game and you usually have to require doing a bunch of stuff like using electric rods of some sort, of course this is unless the level 77 doesn't go super saiyan 3 and one shot the boss. (And yes Sam if you are reading this I havn't watched it yet but I can still refrence it so keep your hair on)\n\nThe more you level up the stronger you become. You will be able to complete higher difficulties and get better gear. Along with this you kind of pass the new players and get in with the cool kids. These people suck. Im in games and they all agree to only take what you need. And im looking at items no one wants thinking, "You are wasting valuable mana here!" (Mana is the currency for traps and the forge system, which is pretty much an average upgrade system) So i wait untill the last five seconds then mash 'E' and hope no ones see's me.\n\nThe highest level is 100. Im currently at level 45 or so. This means i can't say what it's like with the tough kids as i'm still only in with the cool kids. But i'm under the impression it is just a bit more serious.\n\nSo the game may come off kind of bad here. I didn't exactly say it was perfect because it really isnt, and there isnt going to be a change either. However, the game is very fun. I really enjoy it because i am a big fan of tower defence games and Dungeon Defenders ticks all the boxes and goes further. The maps don't seem to get old and the players all working together makes the game feel more like an RP that other games. Also when you max out your character, you make another one and do that twice more before you have to give them more money. That isn't very good in my opinion as i did pay for the game but i don't mind because the amount of play time in those four characters is more than most tower defence games have in total.\n\nIm sorry if im confusing you or my sentances arn't the best but im very ungood at writing stuff. In conclusion, buy the game. It really is worth the money and with the second game coming out soon it would do you well to get a feel for how the game works so when Dungeon Defenders 2 is released you won't be kicked for being a scrub.","June 30, 2014","true","16.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It plays much like an RPG game with tower defense elements which are combined in a very interesting way. Loved the campaign, even though i played it alone. Only thing that i miss is enemy re-routing like in other tower defense games. You simply can't do it here. The shield barrier hat you can place doesn't seen them through the other path even if that one is free. They simply attack the barrier. Same for towers, they can attack them which is rather unusual for a tower defense game. Only annoying till you adapt to this.\n\nOther two things that i also don't like is the loot management, in later games you get so much items after every wave it's ridiculous and even though there is a yay and nay system with a thumb icon, it's still jolly overwhelming and difficult to manage. So i basically just used 2 staff weapons that i felt have good stats and i upgraded that. Similar for the rest.\nSecond thing is, the game is rather short and the rest of the stuff you think you have turns out to be just tons and tons of DLC stuff that you have to pay. Even half of friggin challenges. Not cool.\n\nDespite what it seems like a lot of negative things about it, it's still a good game that i'd recommend, just be aware that not everything you see in the menus is playable. So you won't be disappointed afterwards. Had quite some fun, so yeah, still recommended.","July 6, 2014","true","15.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Pretty addicting, but isn't suitable for neither FPS or Strategy players. This game tries to combine few game jenres, but then it becomes not so cool as it should be. In addition to that it has, let's say, not the best engine, for the tower defence game. Still, if you got a lot of free time - you might want to waste it in DunDef, other than in any korean MMO.","December 24, 2013","true","209.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If they had stopped there, the game would have been insanely popular.\n\nBut they started releasing tons of 'tweaks' that changed things by (usually) 30-40%.  Changes on such a scale are a bad idea, and quickly unbalanced everything.  Months later, the changes now seem to be fairly stable...  If it weren't for all the DLC.\n\nSee, the DLC tends to add further unbalancing changes.  And the cycle continues, over and over.\n\nBuy this game for the original content, and try not to be disturbed by the changes.  It's immensely fun.\n\nAnd if you buy the DLC, expect it to be horribly unbalanced.\n\nAlso, bring friends, or play solo.

If you never played Dungeon Defenders before, play this one before Dungeon Defenders Eternity. Dungeon Defenders Eternity disgraces everything about the original. They tried to fix alot of stuff that wasn't broke, and broke a game that was quite good to begin with.\n\nIt's true, this had alot of hackers cause it was too easily hacked (dunno WHY people have to ruin such a great game, what is so fun about hacking!? Nothing...), and though Dungeon Defenders Eternity solved the issue of making the game hard to hack, they ended up changing alot of other aspects based on the first Dungeon Defenders which saddens me to the extreme.\n\nOtherwise, this game is good, this game is great, this game is a gem among gems that no one should hate.

The intricate mechanics are superb, the level design is both challenging and balanced, well tested with almost zero faults, the sheer volume of numbers and just how quickly the engine of the game calculates the smooth loot drops with superbly balanced, well designed non faulting algorithms [number of mobs defeated in total * (number of mobs defeated personally + amount of damage done in total) / 1 = Stats Level on next drop] means that you get perfectly balanced, well designed, non faulting, algorithm crafted balanced perfectly loot that's been well designed.\n\nThe action is simply scintillating with almost no down time for a breath and the games design that's both perfect and well balanced means that the grind of a normal moba such as DotA 2 or Team Fortress 2 just simply isn't there.

The game includes a trendynet online service where if your connection stops for a moment or the servers go offline for a second, you get kicked to the main menu for all of your progress to be deleted. This greatly adds to the challenge when you are farming an 8 hour survival match for one pet. Don't forget to buy your Obombo President DLC and your super cool barbarian outfits. Gear also becomes extremely fun to obtain at high levels, requiring the player to spend upwards of billions of mana on a single item, so you better farm farm farm you ♥♥♥♥ing scrub. But you probably won't get to that as you have to spend another 13 dollars on this piece of ♥♥♥♥ just to even see the items.

The endgame numbers grind is another flaw that hits the fun factor like a ton of metaphoric bricks, but by the time you get to that point, you’ve well gotten your money’s worth.\n\nOverall, Dungeon Defenders is a quaint tower defense game with enough fresh angles to make it worth the journey.","December 27, 2011","true","307.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Like armor actually showing up. Sure, Eternity got it but why not DD1? Anyway, it nailed the tower defense bit.\n\nEDIT- AFTER DD2 CAME: Looking at DD2, it says there is only 4 classes in the game, whilst there is many more in DD1- meaning more depth and things to do. In my opinion DD1 is the best out of the three.\n\n(NOTE: I have not actually played eternity or dd2, i know that eternity is a nerfed and mobile port version of dd1. I plan to play 2 sometime, and if by then 2 got better I will add an edit to this review)\n\nAlthough they stopped working on this game, while they were they added, what, I don't know, like 50+ DLC's or something. (I got the bundle so I don't know.)\n\n9.9/10 Awesome game, but there is a point where you can just place aout 3 traps and win the level/mission without fail. *cough* how someone beat whole campaign on nightmare for me *cough*","March 30, 2015","true","737.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

This game may not seem like much, But it takes a new twist of gameplay. Combing action RPG combat with Tower Defence Stratagy. After I sat down and played it for an extended peroid of time I fell in love with this game. To put it simply. There are so many weapons, armors and pets it's not even funny. 4 player co-op campain (and in some cases 6) the game isn't too story driven but it does have a nice story. Unlike a normal tower defence game you take control over your hero during the combat phase and fight enemys in real time, Be in over the shoulder third-person, First person or eagle eye view it satisfies it all.

Combining every class' unique towers makes for the best defense against waves.\n\nThe replayability of the game is there, however it is as interesting as you are willing to let it be.\nOnce you hit level 70 the game becomes a grind fest, hitting away at hardest difficulty maps (with the potential to fail and get nothing much) loses its fizz later on.\n\n","June 5, 2014","false","81.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Like most tower defence games, the main goal of the game is to not let the enemies get to what you're trying to protect, in this case, the Eternia Crystals.\n\nTowers, walls, traps, machines, and auras keep the enemies from advancing, but that's not the only element of gameplay which is essential. Your character itself will also see more direct combat with foes using a wide variety of melee weapons, staves, spears, bows, and guns. Not to mention a large assortment of pets to boost your towers, buff your stats, or just beat your enemies up.\n\nEach class has its own strengths, weaknesses, towers, and skills. Stats can be assigned to focus on hero damage, tower damage, or a hybrid depending on how you want to play. Items are random and even pre-set ones always have random stats.\n\nThere's a free demo.

The heroes go away for blood and glory, leaving the apprentices behind. As any proper apprentice does, they messed up and now hordes of orcs are invading you from every corner to destroy the Eternia Cristals and unleash a new latent evil).\n\nSo long story short - you have a cristal and you have to defend it at all cost.\n\nThe positives:\n+ Very fluid game\n+ Different Classes with unique traps and tricks\n+ Nice cartoonish characters\n+ Smooth Learning curve\n+ Can be amazingly challenging, depending on how you play it\n+ Nice to play with friends and family\n\nThe negatives\n- Can be repetitive (after 60h of game I am still loving it, but I can understand why people would say that)\n- Very segmented in DLCs. It is frustrating when you realize that you only have 50% of the game, and the other 50% is in DLCs.\n- Playing on-line with strangers is not very fun. Strangers dont tend to play as a team and the game becomes more a race to see who plants more of their own traps. Furthermore, higher levels will have no trouble outshining the lower level players.\n\nMy personal experience:\n\nI have 2 characters - one in which I have been using to play alone (full single player, without even mixing classes) and other that I use to play with my wife.\n\nMy experience as single player - From what I read - and from what I believe it is the way the game was built to be played, when going single - you should use several characters and combine their traps in the most efficient way. Personally speaking, I have found extremely fun and challeging only using one character and its own abilities/traps. And trust me - it is hard, challenging, and sometimes it even seems impossible.\n\nWhen I am playing with my wife - we often spend time discussing where and when to place traps in the latter maps, and we are already working as a well oiled machine in the maps that we know better. We have been able to evolve characters +\- at the same time, and it is nice to see that even though we use different classes, we both feel that our roles as individuals and as a team are important to beat the level.\n\nI feel that evolving the characters at a simillar rate has helped improving the fun of the game. If you have a couple of close friends that commit to level their characters at the same pace as you guys, everybody will feel important during game play and everybody will draw the most fun of it.\n\nJust a personal opinion, but this is a game I would definitaly recommend, either if you are playing single or multi with close friends.\n\n","August 26, 2015","true","79.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has leveling , gear, pets, loot, tower defense and everything else. It really does have it all.\n\nThe most addictive game I have ever played in history of gaming. Also the game I have spent a nearly impossible amount of hours I never thought I would get to. I am a veteran that played this game for three years off an on very heavily. In the summertime I was a regular, many times in college too I became a regular that would endlessly farm the dreaded map known as Lab Assault for the best gear and pets in the game; end-game farming.\n\nLet's breakdown the game and the cons and positives I see:\n\nGameplay: Gameplay is nonetheless the perfect combination of simplicity, a balance between reward over much longer periods of time to keep gamers hooked and always coming back for more. This game is meant to be played in four player co-op online with friends. It is a hardcore game that is setup like a MMO rather because of the grindy xp from the gap from level 90 to level 100 which by my caculations if you normally get it the fastest and easiest way doing a map called Tavern Defense on the hardest difficulty being NM hardcore it would take 10+ hours per character to get level 90 to max level 100 if starting from level 1 powerleving your character. I base this caculation based off of the 1.5 billion xp it takes to hit level 100.\n\nHackers are present alot online on ranked. That is why if you trade on the official DD forum or from other trustable users make sure to visit the forum and put your items in the item check thread to get precise clarity that all the items you have are indeed possible and legit.\n\nFrom my own personal experience this game made me come back again and again to master what I had already achieved over and over again until I pretty much mastered every single NM map out there with a few exceptions such as Winter Wonderland, Crystalline, Planitir & Aquanos. All the rest I mastered for the fairest part.\n\nThe other factor that led me to keep coming back is helping others. Those brand new in the game and then those that I found through hosting online pubs and friending online. I never minded powerleveling alot of users for it was my pleasure to do so.\n\n\nBalance and Reward system: To be honest the game's system is exactly like gambling. Some days you wil come home and win big while other days when farming for the best gear and weapons you will receive trolled stats with some important and key stats missing or just others that do not cap when you hope they will. This is a large part of the reason why so many users spend hundreds of hours farming on this game because the reward system does not come without a full out dedication and pursual to grind it out daily and weekly if you want the best of the best.\n\nYes, I have at least 2500 hours of non-afk time of gameplay in this game. I can remember that I bought this game shortly one month after it was released on PC. It instantly had me hooked after the first three hours. So much where the next day it became five to six hour sessions and continued and continued until I eventually obssessed over just stats, cosmetics, and event items. If you don't believe me then feel free to check out my steam profile and some of the collection of 950+ screenshots of this game I have taken over the years. I have all dlc with the exception of two costume packs by the way.\n\n\nControls: Mouse and keyboard controls work best for this game. Control movements are quick and fluid. I wish I could say the same about my DDE cheap impulse buy but I can't lol. Controls and camera are very agile and keeps a good drive and feel even when there are thousand of enemies in a wave at a time.\n\nDLC: Majority of the dlc is new maps, new characters and the increased level cap when you unlock nightmare mode by purchasing the Eternia Shards Complete DLC. Many characters such as the jester, barbarian, summoner and series EV you will want because they all give you an advantage to improving your building, reinforcing your defenses and then increasing your overall best dps. Jester ups your defenses faster then any other character can while the summoner has seperate defenses then other characters; he can stand in one spot and just summon across the whole map without moving. Series EV buffs your defenses so you survive in NM mode essentially. All these characters are very important for nightmare mode.\n\nReplayability factor: Here is a con of mine I will always have. After you have completed all the achievements, maps on all difficulty modes, all challenges and gotten past 5k builders ; maybe up to 6k and higher for builders and some dps characters then there really is not much point to trying to grind for the absolute best gear which has like a 1.7% drop rate.\n\nGear rarities and sets:  You have armor sets you get by collecting pieces of the same type of armor. They are listed in the form of level required. godly, mythical, trans, supreme, ultimate and finally ultimate + and ultimate ++ gear which is hard as hell to endlessly grind for like your gambling almost.\n\nLastly, I normally would not recommend this game to majority of people beause of the time investment in takes to keep up with other people in game, the addictive tendencies of a flawed balance and reward system for gear where to create new sets without trading it could take ten's to hundreds of hours depending on how far you want to go.\n\nFinally this was the first game that started an obsession past the basic grounds of video game addiction for me for three years.I tried to quit this game about six times and just could not force myself to put it down. I went past what most players would do consisting of me running a map running service for a quick map I mastered doing 880 runs in two weeks time which took me more than a hundred hours to get capping ult sets and double cap diamonds which are some of the best higher gear in the game other than ult+ and ult++. I had a few capping ult+ through trading here and there too lol.\n\nThe story goes that I gave all this legit gear to one of my friends so then I could take a three month break from steam fully. I deleted then all 299 of my friends I met through playing DD online. Let me remind you this is after that summer where my save files all got corrupted and I started from scratch. I releveled since then six new maxed out level heroes ; got the rare Bunny squire costume lol and did that service for the community before my final departure with the game. Overall I had eighteen max level characters if you count twelve on my original characters that got deleted when my save files got corrupted and all my game data got lost. Six max level heroes combined with backup builders and heroes non-max level after I started back from scratch.\n\n\nAll in all for the sake of this review I will recommend it. Just a warning: Be wise and do not carelessly lose sense of obligations, refuse to hang out with friends, loss of social life, refuse to hear what family has to talk about and then donate 120 or more hours with two weeks time to this game repetitively. Like I say I was obssessed with this game ; so much to where I couldn't get past my obsession for at least a good two years.\n\nYet as I am writing this review I still flock back on the game every so often just to see my bunny squire. What does that say about me when I love my bunny squire costume so much sometimes I just play some maps with friends or help people out to see my bunny character again with his backpack of eggs?","February 9, 2014","false","577.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

A basic play through on the default difficulty actually doesn't take that long. Nightmare mode on the other hand is damned near impossible. Even if you do manage it, you'll probably feel compelled to do it better next time. That's what kept me playing: trying to obtain the ultimate defense.\n\nThe game is Tower Defense crossed with 3rd Person Shooter. As you level up you can choose to increase the stats of either your hero or towers, or maybe a bit of both. Increasing stat points along with loads of unique item drops, the possibility of two characters having the same configuration are slim to none. There is now also a PvP arena, so you can test out the metal of your uniquely configured hero.\n\nThe negative side to Dungeon Defenders is that it's "secure" ranked server really isn't secure at all. You'll sometimes encounter players who have gear with impossibly high stats that are clearly hacked. I've reported several hackers and scammers to Trendy myself but they don't seem too concerned with the problem. Most likely because they're now focused on Dungeon Defenders 2, which is sadly nothing like the first game.. (it's a DOTA clone).\n------------------\nEdit:\n\nDungeon Defenders Eternity Edition is now out. It's much more secure as most things are now done server side instead of locally.  I strongly advise that you purchase the Eternity edition over this one.\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/302270/","October 31, 2013","true","679.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If, however, you're playing with a friend (or three), especially if you're playing locally, then you'll likely have a lot of fun.\n\nIt's a tower defense game with RPG levelling elements and randomly generated loot galore.  The regular campaign is interesting, and the eternia shards campaign extends the challenge and the difficulty a great deal, but it introduce new enemies which have some... balance issues.  The game can get a bit grindy at points while you try to acquire new loot, and some of the extended/additional levels really don't seem that well thought out, but there is still a lot of fun to be had with this game.\n\nIf a tower defense with RPG elements piques your interested, then I'd just go the whole hog and get the full collection - it's definitely worth your money (especially if it's on sale). There is the potentially for many, many hours of gameplay here, provided you're interested in the style and the strategy. The only warning I would give is that it's much less fun single player, and the online multiplayer community is fairly limited at this point in time.  If you need to play online for your multiplayer, I'd probably just wait until Dungeon Defenders 2 comes out and see how that's received.","December 25, 2013","true","349.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mvalles19/recommended/65800/","mvalles19","TheCrimsonGhost","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mvalles19/","317 products in account","Dungeon Defenders adds a new twist to tower defense with a mishmash of RPG, action, and tower defense gameplay elements making for a worthwhile investment. There is plenty of content to keep players busy – whether it be working their way through the campaign and tackling challenges. It’s not with its setbacks, though, with the less-than-exciting combat system and loot that feels more like a chore than a reward system.\n\nTower defense sits at the heart of Dungeon Defenders. The player takes on the role of a Squire, Apprentice, Huntress, or Monk using traps, barricades and magic to defend the castle from an army of evil creatures these would-be child heroes have mistakenly unleashed. Each level plays out in an arena with several entry points for enemies to spawn from. It is the player’s job to analyze the level map and exploit choke points with barricades and traps to prevent enemies from destroying the Eternia crystal at the center of the map. The game is played from the third-person perspective, requiring characters to traverse the map to set up towers while battling enemies along the way.\n\nEnemies are varied and numerous, requiring different strategies to counter their abilities. Hulking orcs will devastate defenses, mages heal enemy units, and suicidal kobolds rush towers with dynamite strapped to their backs. Minibosses in the form of giant ogres made us rethink our tower placement in several situations and the major bosses present the biggest challenges in the game.\n\nDungeon Defenders has all of the workings of the standard RPG fused into the tower defense gameplay. Player classes have unique abilities, armor, weapon types, and towers. Killing enemies, conquering campaign levels, and completing challenges earns experience which unlocks abilities and towers as well as more powerful items. Character and tower attributes can be upgraded with points earned upon leveling through a somewhat confusing menu system – improving maximum health, damage, casting speed, and movement speed, among others.\n\nAll of these features add a great deal of replayability to the game – as does the multiplayer. Once we worked through the levels and beefed up one character, we wanted to level up a complementary character to make proper use of the character swap feature and get the upper hand on some of the more difficult challenges. Setting up spiked barricades as the Squire and switching to the Apprentice to place projectile throwing magic towers makes for a devastating combination. It feels great to level up a character, unlock the advanced towers, and add them to your defense strategy. Playing with a friend or three adds a new dimension in strategy as we were required to actively communicate in tower placement, mana distribution, and repair efforts to hold back the onslaught. The real fun comes in joining a party of friends to tackle the hardest challenges and picking up epic loot.\n\nUnfortunately the action aspect of gameplay falls short. The combat became stale very quickly. Although the characters have special abilities like the Squire’s spin attack or the Huntress’ invisibility, we rarely found a need to use them. Enemies were easily dispatched with well-placed towers and planning trap layouts and developing strategies was fun, but jumping into the fray was not – especially with the melee characters. Combat essentially involves mashing on the one attack button and maybe throwing in a special ability for kicks. Neither feels particularly effective and leaves the combat feeling shallow.\n\nAnother problem we had with Dungeon Defenders was the loot. Items can be found in treasure chests and is also dropped by enemies. Picking up epic new armor or weapons and equipping them to benefit from their attribute bonuses is a strong motivator to up the difficulty on the challenges, but the problem lies in having to sort through piles and piles of useless loot at the end of a wave. Checking each dropped item’s stats to compare to our equipped set slowed the game down considerably since all of the loot is spread across the map and it takes at least a few seconds to inspect an item. While we could just run through the map and throw everything into our item box to review later, having fewer, more useful drops would have kept loot gathering from becoming such a chore.\n\nDungeon Defenders is a worthwhile addition to your game library with plenty of content for the price. Although the combat falls short, the tower defense gameplay, RPG elements, and the challenging game modes will have fans of tower defense delighted.\n","December 31, 2013","true","15.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

A basic play through on the default difficulty actually doesn't take that long. Nightmare mode on the other hand is damned near impossible. Even if you do manage it, you'll probably feel compelled to do it better next time. That's what kept me playing: trying to obtain the ultimate defense.\n\nThe game is Tower Defense crossed with 3rd Person Shooter. As you level up you can choose to increase the stats of either your hero or towers, or maybe a bit of both. Increasing stat points along with loads of unique item drops, the possibility of two characters having the same configuration are slim to none. There is now also a PvP arena, so you can test out the metal of your uniquely configured hero.\n\nThe negative side to Dungeon Defenders is that it's "secure" ranked server really isn't secure at all. You'll sometimes encounter players who have gear with impossibly high stats that are clearly hacked. I've reported several hackers and scammers to Trendy myself but they don't seem too concerned with the problem. Most likely because they're now focused on Dungeon Defenders 2, which is sadly nothing like the first game.. (it's a DOTA clone).\n------------------\nEdit:\n\nDungeon Defenders Eternity Edition is now out. It's much more secure as most things are now done server side instead of locally.  I strongly advise that you purchase the Eternity edition over this one.\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/302270/","October 31, 2013","true","679.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You can set up towers of course, but you can also get in the action yourself. Settiing up towers and running around killing all those goblins and orcs is a great way to spend some time.\nNow the problem with the game itself is the huge grind it offers. Things are fine when you are playing on normal through insane difficulty. But once you hit nightmare the game because a sluggish chore. You'll play the same levels over and over hopeing that the RNG gods will smile upon you and give you a good drop, but of course that will most likely never happen.\n\nI would love to give this game a one hundread precent recommendation, but end game just leaves a sour taste in my mouth. Despite end game being a major bummer there is still plenty of fun to be had though.","July 28, 2015","true","264.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The screen does get very cluttered, though, and it can become easy to miss a key visual such as your crystal being attacked, which can lead to losing a game. This event is accompanied by a sound for HOH gamers.\n\nSubtitles/Text\nDungeon Defenders has a storyline that plays in cutscenes. When you turn captions on, the cutscenes will be the only time that you see the subtitles, as the gameplay does not require them.\n\nChatting/Communicating\nDungeon Defenders has voice chat. In my experience so far, most people do not seem to use it, though, and prefer to type. There are no key combinations or voice binds to convey messages quickly, so you will need to type if you cannot hear/speak.","June 24, 2013","true","67.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It takes all of the fun of a normal tower defense game and combines it with a fps kind of. You have the option of first or third person point of view with your character and there are tons of customization options not with apperance unfortunatlly, but with your stats. If you wanna go all out dps then you can or maybe you wanna have the strongest towers in the game you can. You can even go both and still be really good. All classes are balanced and all of the maps are fun and different to where you'll have to change up your strategy everytime to get maximum efficiency. After you finish up the campaign on all 5 difficulties plus hardcore, pure strategy, and survival there are a ton of challanges for you to work on. After all of that there are steam workshop missions, DLC missions ( campaign and challanges), and even pvp maps so you can test your strength and strategies against your friends and other online players. Over all I give this game a 9/10 because there are always things that can be improved in all games, but please check out this game and start having tons of fun. There are still other things i haven't mentioned about this game, but you'll have to buy the game and play it for yourself to find out. There is also Dungeon Defenders 2 comming out soon so get in the bandwagon now and beat this game for practice.

You can build cool towers then sit back and drink a coke or you can play a combat focused class and be in the middle of the fray. The learning curve takes a bit to figure out on multi-player games and you might get yelled at once or twice for picking up something you can't use but overall it's a pretty easy game to get good at and a pain to be great. Most of the players are pretty laid back and cool, many times someone jumps in to give me advise randomly. I would also suggest you don't play this game alone. Friends, even random players, make this game more fun by a factor of 10. Not to mention you can see strats in play and how the other classes operate. I would say go for the Collection pack if you can the extra classes and maps are very cool and change the game play a little. If not you might get Jelly early watching others playing them. I put in about 40 hours since I got the game and I haven't even scratched the surface.

I am reviewing this game purely as a game by itself.\n\nI picked this up through Humble Bundle almost a year ago and didn't actually play it till recently. Its a creative tower defense game that is more or less designed to be played with multiple people. You could, in theory single player it but then you would be grinding a LOT to get your characters to a certain level.\n\nOnline play I do not think I can recomend, there is basically no servers....but you get that a lot with some older steam games.\n\nLocal Co-Op (or Lan, or playing with people you personally know online) I can definately recommend. Me and my wife and some of my friends head over to my house to play this as a couch co-op game all the time and its a butt tonne of fun. My wife ussually doesn't play video games "unless you can raise a baby in them" (sims, harvest moon, pokemon (yeah I don't get that last one either)) and she loves playing this game with me.\n\nAll in all, not a terrible game. Not an amazing game for full price. But not a terrible one. I recomend doing what I did and waiting till its on a bundle, or through a steam sale and treating it as a "Local Couch multiplayer game"","April 7","true","18.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

A real joy to sink many, many hours into.\n\nIt hybrids straight up Tower Defence with 3rd person battling so very well that it's without peer. A lovely clean art style which is well presented so that it remains easy on the eye even during periods of intense action and after hours of play. Fighting is very fluid indeed, and where it also shines is in the variety of character classes and their applicable skills.\n\nThe Mage for example, has the most conventional options in straight-up towers that fire missiles. Monks and Archer have some clever traps and AOE placings. Played on their own they really demand different layouts and tactics, but when played together (you can place traps/towers with one character and switch and combine them on the fly) they REALLY sing.\n\nThis lends itself to some very good multiplayer play.\n\nContent-wise, the main campaign is solid, and will last you a good few hours on the first playthrough. However, with various difficulty settings (and the appropriate loot to go with them) it begs repeated play. You're unlikely to get bored with these basic levels, as they are very well designed, and will offer the freedom for a variety of experimentation in layouts.\n\nBut, if this were not enough, there's also a myriad of challenges based on these maps which will truly test your abilities - with their own unique rewards too!\n\nSo, add in Steam Workshop ability which has been well-supported by the community, and you have one of the best bang-for-your-buck games on Steam.\n\nIf you love Tower Defence, or even are remotely interested in the genre, then this is an essential purchase.","November 27, 2013","true","185.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The Character Progression, Loot Gathering, Item creation & pet systems were very well blended in with the Strategy, Team work & Tower Defence. You can create a diverse Defence or Offence with the option of changing characters through the time limit between levels. Dungeon Defenders revolves around two very distinct phases, the build phase & the combat phase. Your main goal is to protect the Eternity Crystal with the two phases by using your build phase for defence systems against the enemy and upgrading and changing heros to add more builds. Then the Combat phase where you go hand in hand combat with the enemy line by running around to stop the enemy from attacking your Eternity Crystal. The key thing in Dungeon Defenders is presistance, because all your characters are presisting. Trendy Entertainment has done it again and in my personal review shows that it is everything in a downloadable title.

Fair enough, you can avoid any other person and just play on your own, but as we all know it's more fun with other players.\n\nWhat's worst is if you buy items from another player ingame or they simply drop an item for you, if that item is not a legitimate item then you risk being punished for it. Yes, TrendyNet have no real way of securing their game or servers... I mean server sided items would be logical and stuff but nope. If you have hacked items knowingly or not, you risk being banned.\n\nThey even had a forum thread where you could post screenshots and details of items to find out if they were legit. If they weren't, you were simply told to destroy the item. Despite losing millions of mana you probably spent weeks saving to buy it. Millions?! You'd actually be lucky because anyone with half a brain cell can easily hack this flawed game even mana is hacked so people trade by the billions in mana tokens. So the chances of playing this game fairly and getting anywhere is fairly difficult.\n\nEnd of it all, the game becomes rather linear and boring in the end. If you managed to get it on sale like 75% or 85% off like I did, yeah it would be okay for a few hours or days of fun but don't expect anything long term. At the full price I would advise anyone honestly to stay clear of this game.\n\nThese are my honest and personal opinions of the game which I have obtained through witnessing and playing the game myself. I'm not one to condone or encourage or even cheat / hack on a game which is why I refuse to play this game any more.\n\nI put it down to a very limited amount of enjoyment before realising the end game is completely ruined.\n\nIf you still like the idea of buying a game you have to salvage all the way to ensure all your gear is legit then go for it, personally I don't think this company deserve your money until they are prepared to implement a real anti-hack system / feature. So I would have to recommend you do not buy this game.\n\nMy honest opinions from an honest gamer.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Identityflux/recommended/65800/","Identityflux","Jazz Candy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Identityflux/","138 products in account","Dungeon Defenders is a quirky little game where, on top of being a tower defense, you also have to run around and shoot things. Ever played Sanctum 1 or 2? Then keep your money, bud, cause this is just a less fun version.\n\nThe basic premise is you four heroes in training must hold the line against invading waves of heroes while the real heroes are out gettin donuts or somethin. I didn't pay attention to that bit. So you build turrets and collect resources dropped from chests and enemies to build turrets or to upgrade your abilities and weapons. In the end we have an tower defense third person shooter with rpg elements. It's got a cute little cell shaded graphic style that I can't help but find appealing and honestly the actual mechanics of it all aren't half bad if you can excuse the fact that projectile attacks are virtually useless if not awkward as a 14 year old trying to talk about his sexual experiences in a positive light. Yeah I bet you got it good last night, Uncle Paul.\n\nSo why not reccomend it? BECAUSE IT'S BOOOOOOOOORING. Honestly, the game is so unbelievably slow paced. Everything is slow, the enemies are slow, the projectiles are slow, the turrets are slow, every attack is slow and boring and lame. I'd call it a childrens game, but Kameo: Elements of Power was a childrens game and on the hardest difficulty can at least keep you paying attention. You know what else is a childrens game? The Legend of Zelda. A game that isn't combat orriented still has far superior combat mechanics and faster paced gameplay then a game that boasts it.\n\nOn top of the slow game play, it's just plain awkward. Projectile attacks can hardly be called skill shots, since the move barely any faster than the enemies and you never run out of amunition. Only the mage and the knight are really worth anything because the knight can literally just stop an entire wave with two turrets and shell them with cannonballs that are basically 2 hit kills on large enemies. The monk supposedly has healing abilities but there's never any need because you have to actually try to die in this game.\n\nSimply put, it's boring. It's cute, it's quirky, it's unique(kinda), but it's just too slow. It's upgrade system is just a massive min/maxfest and leaves so much to be desired.\n\nShould you buy it?\nDo you play EVE online? Yes? This game is gonna be too slow even for you.","September 25, 2014","false","59.1"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","3"

After downloading the game you are immediatly swarmed with adverts for their dlc and offers. This is really annoying because it gets in the way of the gameplay and slows everything down to a snails pace. There is virtually no tutorial to speak of; you need to figure out how to play the game on your own. You have 4 starting classes to choose from (unless you shelled out the extra cash to buy more characters). The classes themselves are actually somewhat unique, but it becomes quickly apparent that there are two classes that outshine the others.\nThe graphics are ugly, bright, and basic. My eyes were sore after playing for a few hours. The items that the game occasionally spits at you don't feel unique or interesting at all. The gameplay revolves around collecting gems, putting up towers, and occasionally chopping down bigger monsters. The only part about this game I enjoyed was playing with my friends.

I managed to reach level 35 on my Apprentice since I love the way I can just sit back and just repair my turrets without going in myself and fighting them like Warriors do. After that, level 70's started joining my game, so I thought "Oh wow some help is great!". After a few hours of them helping me grind the constant waves of monsters, I found myself at level 65. I started doubting why I even let them join me, not in a rude way but in a way that it started getting boring because I basically let them level up for me.\n\nAlthough this was a huge mistake, it was a mistake made by me. A mistake I didn't think would happen. The game I loved to play turned into a game I found so boring in just a few hours. I now have 3 level 100's since I didn't have access to other classes at the time. That's another thing - class selection. You have to buy DLC to unlock other class's to play, which can be a little bit over-priced just for a new class. For example, the Summoner DLC costs £2.99 just for one class!\n\nThis game does seem a little bit like they are forcing you to buy DLC, since it always comes up on the screen when you load up the game, as well as when you pick the level nearly everything you have to pay for - but that's just my opinion.","October 24, 2014","true","38.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I give the developers of Dungeon Defenders serious props for mixing two of my favorite game types: action RPG with Diablo-esque item hoarding, and competent, serious tower defense. Double-props for making this game available on portable platforms (for free too!), however the game is far from perfect. The RPG aspect is basically broken, as players develop min-max tower and combat characters just to war-stomp matches... This provides little challenge, and even less reward. Maps that seem "random" and chaotic at first eventially become efficiency matches, as you try to maximize your score. If there was more of a random element to this game, and if players were given incentive to experiment with character design, this game would be one in a million. As it stands the game is a lot of fun, but only for a little while. At $15 you can't go wrong however. Don't get this game if you have a download cap however, as this game updates ALL FILES, DAILY.","November 18, 2011","true","22.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

Tower defense, hack'n'slash, "RPG" elements, it's definitely all there. The big question is: does it work? To sum it up, my answer is "not quite". Dungeon Defenders works on the base premise that there's something that must be left untouched by the vile horde of monsters in a fantasy setting for its core gameplay. And as advertised, you can pick any of the hero classes and have multiple heroes with persisting stats the longer you play the game, swapping them out as needed.\n\nEach hero has multiple stats, the "RPG" elements now, that make it more proficient in their respective stats' areas. Care to improve your tower damage? Stat it up on gaining a level. Maybe you want to make your hero beefier? Same deal. Move speed, hero's damage, cast time improvements? It's all there. There's even equipment for the heroes to use and pets that function as "stat sticks" if nothing else; arguably the most important piece of equipment are weapons.\n\nEach level works in waves, which is a good thing. Since every wave is always the same, unless in certain cases, you can memorize how waves play out and plan how to place your defenses. Simple enough; just do what works for you, some would say.\n\nBut here's where it gets messy: defense points, used to place defenses, ARE SHARED BETWEEN PLAYERS. What does that mean? It means that someone that specialized in tower-gameplay stats will be prefered for building rather than a hybrid or an "action-hero"-built someone. And this is where the game simply is broken; they encourage this sort of behaviour further with insane higher difficulty modes, where everyone has to be just perfect to win. If you're out with your tower builder you gain experience with him, and vice-versa with your action guy. Playing alone, then, is frustrating because if you're switching around you're not really efficient either.\n\nIt also doesn't feel rewarding to be a good tower-builder, because if you're online someone else will just be using their left mouse button to mash the hordes down in between doing their best to avoid your towers' innevitable demise. It feels rewarding to be that button masher, but not the strategist that should-but-isn't able to defeat the insane difficulty level's horde; that's my biff with this game.\n\nYes, it's fun at first. But unless you're playing in the "unregulated" league you're only going to reach the beggining of the end-game without a good group online, and playing in the unregulated league is where all the hackage and cheat-enabled characters are, which make the game pointless anyway. My final recomendation? Play the game, but be prepared to think it was all a waste of time.","February 17, 2014","true","83.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Instead, what Trendy Entertainment did was ACCOMMODATE these awful things by spiking up the difficulty of new content. So ♥♥♥♥ 'em.\n\nOtherwise, it is fun.

This Game. Is Dungeon Defenders. A nice game with good artwork and gameplay that is fast and can get intense. The heroes, Squire, Huntress, Apprentice, and Monk, must defend their castle against waves of enemies, and to protect the Eternia Crystals. If these Crystals were to be broken. Well... lets just say "Game Over Man! Game Over!" The only downside is that the start of the game is rather.. a bit slow. But wait until you get higher in levels. You learn new towers, new abilities, and new dungeons to defend! The DLC is... Required to have the full excitement of this game. You get new classes/characters that are literally required to beat some of the dungeons, but nontheless, very fun to play around with, and see what you can build with the new found classes. The Quest for the Lost Eternia Shards serves its one purpose well! Great gameplay, and challenging! In fact i was so happy to defeat the final boss, Which i WON'T recommend on looking it up. Its the BEST feeling to beat the final boss without a guide, or anything to aid what the final boss does. This game also allows trading with mana, or weapons with other players, and you can get all sorts of achievements to boot! I'd say this game very well deserves 5/5 because of how much content there is. Sure you might run out after a while.

It has RPG elements, strong tower defense elements, and some MOBA/DOTA style elements.   It's also an amazing and fun game.\n\nYou'll have access to four unique classes initially, though DLC unlocks a number more.   Each has their own play style for not just their towers but also their actual fighting.   This means you can enjoy a lot of replay value out of it, as you find different ways to beat the various maps on the higher difficulties with different kits.\n\nAdditionally, you can swap characters between waves of enemies.  So once you grow your character pool, you can solo content on difficulties you would normally want a group for by just setting up defenses as a wider spread of classes.\n\nI've sank around 220 hours into this game and had a blast playing it.","December 5, 2011","true","218.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It is one of my favorites.\nYou are a little hero like an apprentice, knight monk or huntress and have to defend the Eternia Crystals from the evil force in level-based towerdeffense roleplay. The mechanics and uniqueness of each hero and the combination of all are the key to victory. For example, the kobolds are running straight to your crystal and you have an apprentice and your friend a monk. You can easily build a blockade to buy time for the monk to summon an electric aura which shocks the kobolds to death. Well done little hero!\nWith killing enemies and winning levels you can earn weapons or armor, which ups the damage of your electric aura or the durabilty of your spike blockades. Also your character can level up to become stronger. To make it a solo game too, you have before every wave a build phase, where you can build your towers and change to other characters, but the game is best played with a friend. For all who do not have one, you can also join random games or search in the community for friends.\n\nMy biggest problem with the game is the fact, that the game can not played that good without DLCs. While some DLCs just add new characters and levels, some of them are needed to get some levels, so i would buy just the original game or directly all DLCs, so you really know, that you do not buy something you cannot reach without annother DLC. Another good fact about the producer studio is, that EVERY dlc is free for the fist 2 weaks after publication and that is definitly a thing you should support with buying this game.\nAll in all I really recommend this game to all RPG and Towerdeffense fans, because it combines both genres perfectly in an awesome comic style game with a nice community and a modding system.","December 6, 2013","true","516.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

A few years have passed since I last touched Warcraft III, but my love for Tower Defense games never faded. I would always have at least one or two on my iPhone.\n\nThen one day I met Dungeon Defenders.\n\nNot only do you have the freedom to build your towers or traps nearly everywhere on the map; you have your own Hero that you can control and engage in combat. Each Hero has their own types of Towers and Abilities, making the fun for a wide variety of people. The best part of this game is, you don't have the fight the waves of monsters alone. You can bring 3 friends with you to defend the Eternia Crystals. I highly recommend this game, even if don't know much about Tower Defense, because you can spend your skill points on your Hero itself, instead of the towers.\n\nAlways be sure to look at some gameplay before you consider purchasing, it can make or break your decision to buy it.","November 28, 2013","true","46.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I managed to reach level 35 on my Apprentice since I love the way I can just sit back and just repair my turrets without going in myself and fighting them like Warriors do. After that, level 70's started joining my game, so I thought "Oh wow some help is great!". After a few hours of them helping me grind the constant waves of monsters, I found myself at level 65. I started doubting why I even let them join me, not in a rude way but in a way that it started getting boring because I basically let them level up for me.\n\nAlthough this was a huge mistake, it was a mistake made by me. A mistake I didn't think would happen. The game I loved to play turned into a game I found so boring in just a few hours. I now have 3 level 100's since I didn't have access to other classes at the time. That's another thing - class selection. You have to buy DLC to unlock other class's to play, which can be a little bit over-priced just for a new class. For example, the Summoner DLC costs £2.99 just for one class!\n\nThis game does seem a little bit like they are forcing you to buy DLC, since it always comes up on the screen when you load up the game, as well as when you pick the level nearly everything you have to pay for - but that's just my opinion.","October 24, 2014","true","38.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Tower defense, hack'n'slash, "RPG" elements, it's definitely all there. The big question is: does it work? To sum it up, my answer is "not quite". Dungeon Defenders works on the base premise that there's something that must be left untouched by the vile horde of monsters in a fantasy setting for its core gameplay. And as advertised, you can pick any of the hero classes and have multiple heroes with persisting stats the longer you play the game, swapping them out as needed.\n\nEach hero has multiple stats, the "RPG" elements now, that make it more proficient in their respective stats' areas. Care to improve your tower damage? Stat it up on gaining a level. Maybe you want to make your hero beefier? Same deal. Move speed, hero's damage, cast time improvements? It's all there. There's even equipment for the heroes to use and pets that function as "stat sticks" if nothing else; arguably the most important piece of equipment are weapons.\n\nEach level works in waves, which is a good thing. Since every wave is always the same, unless in certain cases, you can memorize how waves play out and plan how to place your defenses. Simple enough; just do what works for you, some would say.\n\nBut here's where it gets messy: defense points, used to place defenses, ARE SHARED BETWEEN PLAYERS. What does that mean? It means that someone that specialized in tower-gameplay stats will be prefered for building rather than a hybrid or an "action-hero"-built someone. And this is where the game simply is broken; they encourage this sort of behaviour further with insane higher difficulty modes, where everyone has to be just perfect to win. If you're out with your tower builder you gain experience with him, and vice-versa with your action guy. Playing alone, then, is frustrating because if you're switching around you're not really efficient either.\n\nIt also doesn't feel rewarding to be a good tower-builder, because if you're online someone else will just be using their left mouse button to mash the hordes down in between doing their best to avoid your towers' innevitable demise. It feels rewarding to be that button masher, but not the strategist that should-but-isn't able to defeat the insane difficulty level's horde; that's my biff with this game.\n\nYes, it's fun at first. But unless you're playing in the "unregulated" league you're only going to reach the beggining of the end-game without a good group online, and playing in the unregulated league is where all the hackage and cheat-enabled characters are, which make the game pointless anyway. My final recomendation? Play the game, but be prepared to think it was all a waste of time.","February 17, 2014","true","83.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Has lovely cartoon graphics on a tower of defense game where you can play co-op or alone, characters have build trees where you can focus your talent points on kill monsters with your weapons, with towers or make hibrid characters. i can't recomend this game enough, 100% addictive and FUN with almost unlimited things to do.","November 25, 2013","true","135.0"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"
