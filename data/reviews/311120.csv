I just completed it on normal difficulty and I honestly can't believe that it got released with all the problems the game mechanics have. Everything you can possibly imagine that could be wrong with a first person shooter is done in this game. There is a rail section where you are in the back seat of a vehicle being shot at with no way to dodge or duck. If you start the mission with anything below 100% health, (meaning you have to complete the previous mission with 100% health) than you might as well reload an older save file and start from a previous mission. There is a sewer level where the water rises, but if you stay underwater too long, you lose health. The problem is that the damage taken for lack of oxygen while being under water is accumulative, meaning that if you begin losing health after being underwater for 10 seconds, and you emerge for air after 9 seconds, going back under the water (which is required) will start to hurt you after being submerged for only 1 second. The game finally concludes with what I can only describe as one of the worst escort missions in FPS history. The only good thing I can think to say is that there were no timed missions.\n\nWell, the game's not all bad. Let's talk about what they did right. First, the game is short, (a good thing in this case). Second, there is a very convenient quick save and quick load feature, so no check point system. The down side to that is that you will be using the quick save/load feature constantly; sometimes over a dozen times just to get past one corner where soldiers are waiting to ambush you. There is absolutely no skill involved in this game what-so-ever. It is simply a matter of getting past an area, gaining a little bit of advancement, quicksaving, and repeating as you gradually progress little by little. The graphics, while terrible by today's standards and not very good for the standards of its release date, do a very effective job in recreating an oppressive, post-war soviet atmosphere. The game attempted to be accurate by implementing a critical hit system, which means that you can have 100% health, but one bullet in the right spot, (heart, head, ect.) can take it down to almost 0%. And trust me, there is an ocean of bullets flying at you. You'll find that this system works in your favor also as using your sniper weapon, (the most crucial firearm in the game) and zooming in for headshots is the most effective way to kill your enemies. It's a trial and error system that will have you dying A LOT!\n\nSo why am I recommending this game? One reason: The price. I got this game for two dollars on sale. For that price it was worth it. Do not pay a dollar more for this game. Deep inside of me, there is a perverse, masochistic streak that takes some sick pleasure in an occasional bad game, much like many people find watching a campy, low-budget movie entertaining. Also, I promise you will enjoy the cutscenes. Trust me on this. They are the most poorly translated, horrendously voice-acted cutscenes you will ever see in your life time. I enjoyed them immensely. If you can find this game for a dollar or two on sale, and you have nothing better to do, give it a try.","October 29, 2014","true","7.5"," 38 of 46 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","38","46","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198017975643/recommended/311120/","76561198017975643","Ian Brandon Anderson","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198017975643/","4667 products in account","(ignore time on file - this game isn't Steam integrated and I played it by launching its executable directly)\n\nThis has to be one of the most infuriating games I've ever played. If it was less sadistic it'd just be a mediocre shooter. As it stands it's entertaining to play if you're a glutton for punishment and want the challenge of seeing the game to completion. I cannot say I recommend it, but it can be enjoyed in a weird way. There are certainly a lot worse games you can get on Steam for 74 cents (what this was on sale for).\n\nThe main difficulty in this game comes from its damage model. On Normal difficulty, a headshot is an instant kill, a body shot takes about 2-5 hits depending on the weapon, then limbs and finally hands/feet do less. This also applies to you, so you will be killed within seconds or instantly if some of the enemies firing machine guns at you from far away get a lucky headshot. Something that's really neat is that there are ricochets, but in practice this just means the enemies mindlessly emptying their 72-round machine guns can kill you when you're behind cover near ricochet-able walls.\n\nAnother challenge in the game is aiming. The enemies reflexes are amazing and they will start firing before you can get out of cover enough to aim. Occasionally you can angle yourself in such a way that you can fire at their limbs without being seen, and you need to take these opportunities when you can. You cannot use the iron sights on your weapons so long-range combat is difficult even with a rifle. You just have to aim your crosshair for center mass and hope for the best.\n\nThe enemy AI is, well... non-existent. They run from their spawn positions, if scripted to do so, and then stand in place immediately firing at you when you come into sight, emptying their magazine. There is rarely the opportunity to sneak up on an enemy from the side or behind, so you will have to quickly duck out from cover as they reload and get a few shots off hoping you don't get hit. Defeated enemies will randomly drop first aid kits which restore 10 of your 100HP. Getting shot once can take anywhere from 5-25 so it's very difficult, but necessary to take down most enemies without taking damage. Quick save/load abuse is mandatory.\n\nDepending on how lucky you are with combat, the game is about 4-6 hours long. The levels mostly involve close-quarters combat with a bit of obstacles like rooftop ledges or vents (aka ricochet 'heaven'). The game is cruel, so it will sometimes spawn enemies behind you after passing certain points in the levels. There is one vehicle segment and the last two levels in the game are escort missions. These are by far the least enjoyable in the game.\n\nThe vehicle level is buggy beyond belief\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=370005033\nIt starts off by you being driven in front of a vehicle with four machine-gun toting enemies. Half of the time they will kill you before you can even get your crosshair over them. The car then stops in a position where two of the enemies are outside of you aiming range, so you have to blow up their vehicle by emptying two AK clips into it. It is a matter of luck if you can do this before the two enemies kill you. Then comes the bugginess... all of the other vehicles in the level seem to have about a 25% chance of spawning correctly. You will then be chased by a rolling tire, which is invulnerable and will crash into your vehicle causing it to explode. If you quick-save and then quick-load multiple times, your game will either crash or sometimes a black car will spawn instead (albeit missing a tire) and you can kill the vehicle before it crashes into you. Thankfully the other invulnerable tires in the level will not cause your vehicle to explode and the level will end. If you should be unlucky enough for a further two vehicles to spawn correctly, there will be eight enemies which you cannot aim at firing at you and killing you. This time you will want to quick-save and quick-load to prevent those from spawning.\n\nApart from the vehicle mission, the game is playable. The escort mission is like a normal level except you have a slow, wounded guy following you. The enemies ignore him and he stays out of the way of their fire, which is nice, BUT every few minutes the game spawns an enemy soldier close to him that runs up to him and empties his machine gun into him. So while you're worried about saving your own skin, cowardly ducking behind cover with an onslaught of four machine guns firing at you, you also have to babysit.\n\nOn a lighter note, the voice acting is hilariously bad and you occasionally catch soldiers having conversations about you before you engage them. It's a bad game no doubt, but I came in with low expectations and got some enjoyment from it.","January 4, 2015","false","1.4"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","21","25","0","0"

I am pretty sure that this game is impossible to beat on normal or hard and it's one of the few games I would ever absolutely recommend playing it on easy.\n\nWait. I don't recommend you play this at all.\n\nPlayer damage registry is a joke. Sometimes you survive a full machine gunning to the face, sometimes you don't. It's sometimes hard to tell when this game will allow you to survive a situation, and you never gauge how to survive any fire fight. On top of that, the level design makes no sense. One of the level exits is BLOCKED by a bike and you're meant to think you're not supposed to go there.\n\nA forced vehicle section is where I cut off and had to refund this piece of garbage. Your vision is locked into a tiny cone and you can barely do anything about the enemies surrounding you. Think that part from Call of Duty 1 but really terrible. At no point did skill feel like a factor and it felt more like I just needed to be lucky to survive - which I didn't.\n\nAND THIS IS ON EASY\n\nGarbage.

I'm not joking, it really is.  I think this could be Dark Souls in FPS form.\n\nFirst of all, the voice acting, cutscenes, dialouge, and the PLOT are crap.  Absolutely not a buy if you want any of these in a game.  The level design?  It's a joke.  You will constantly find yourself lost in what SHOULD be an easy navigation, with some levels worse than others.  Then there are turret sections...  My GOD!  Yeah, lets make a game where the point is realism and lets make you stand still and have nearly every enemy shoot at you at ONCE.  You will probably die more often here than at any other point in the game (And you still die a lot regardless).\n\nHowever, even for 2006, the graphics and textures are pretty good (thoguh the grenade explosions NEED to change).  The physics are floaty for grenades, but all other weapons deal accurate damage.  The gameplay is difficult, sure, but it is this difficulty that makes it fun for some.  The gameplay is argueably this games saving grace.\n\nIf you aren't a fan of turret sections, bouncy physics, crashing to desktop, or terrible story, then don't get this game.  If not, then buy it so you can play it for gameplay stuff.","October 26, 2014","false","1.4"," 29 of 46 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","29","46","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Skops/recommended/311120/","Skops","Skops","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Skops/","405 products in account","The Stalin Subway 2: Red Veil replaces not only protagonist, but also the fun with frustration. Previously in my adventures in the black hole of Orion Games, I enjoyed The Stalin Subway for its schlocky yet, classic approach to FPS games. While the Red Veil shares much in common, the sense of effort is clearly missing in this sequel.\n\nGRAPHICS:Exactly the same as its predecessor. Nearly everything here is reused from the original game apart from the HUD. That's not entirely a bad thing, The Stalin Subway/Red Veil isn't a bad looking game, but some new things to look at would have been nice.\n\nGAMEPLAY:While the controls and overall gameplay stay the same, Red Veil removes some features from its former glory for... what purpose I don't know. The armor meter is gone, though you think that wouldn't be a problem because SS1 almost never gave you any armor anyway. However, it is sorely missed here. Enemies seem to have extremely inconsistent damage output ranging from 2% of your health, to nearly 100% of your health at any given moment.  This makes each gun fight a roll of the dice, and can possibly leave you with a nearly impossible chance of surviving your next encounter.\n\nThe enemy AI itself is heavily scripted. Upon spotting you or reaching it's scripted position, the enemies will stand still and unload entire magazines in your direction until they are forced to reload. This is both highly predictable and abusable. It also breaks the entire pace of the game as you spend 5-10 full seconds waiting around a corner listening to 2 men empty their 72 round drum mags at a wall.\n\nSOUND:All reused asset here again for gameplay sounds. Guns still sound weak, unfitting to their rugged and powerful real-life counter parts. The soundtrack in Red Veil is actually its brightest spot. There's several tunes in the game that I will put in my playlist shortly. The voice acting is.. Amazing. Really, this is undoubtly worse and just as legendary as the original Resident Evil. Do yourself a favor and find these cutscenes, they'll make your day!\n\nSTORY:You play as the wife of the original protagonist of The Stalin Subway; Lana Survorova. As an ex-high ranking officer in the KGB, you and your husband are being hunted down by your former employers. Gleb, her husband, is captured and Lana must rescue him before they make their escape from Moscow... That is the entire story.\nThe amount of levels in Red Veil pales in comparison to it's predecessor which had 32 levels. There are just eight, EIGHT missions in the game and it will take you barely over an hour to complete the entire adventure.\n\nOVERALL:\nThe Stalin Subway 2: Red Veil isn't a sequel, its a single player expansion. Had I paid more than the $0.82 I did, I probably feel ripped off. Even For fans of the original; it's a short, frustrating, and disappointing experience.","December 27, 2014","false","4.2"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

You'll find that this system works in your favor also as using your sniper weapon, (the most crucial firearm in the game) and zooming in for headshots is the most effective way to kill your enemies. It's a trial and error system that will have you dying A LOT!\n\nSo why am I recommending this game? One reason: The price. I got this game for two dollars on sale. For that price it was worth it. Do not pay a dollar more for this game. Deep inside of me, there is a perverse, masochistic streak that takes some sick pleasure in an occasional bad game, much like many people find watching a campy, low-budget movie entertaining. Also, I promise you will enjoy the cutscenes. Trust me on this. They are the most poorly translated, horrendously voice-acted cutscenes you will ever see in your life time. I enjoyed them immensely. If you can find this game for a dollar or two on sale, and you have nothing better to do, give it a try.","April 15, 2015","true","15.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Unlike the first game, this one does work. And that's a good thing, right?\n\nNow with that, now for something completely different.\n\nIntroduction:\n\n*Sigh*....What the flying-circus is this piece of sh!t? I mean, come on! Red Veil dose what it can, but fails at all the rest: Making a good game.\n\nGraphics: It dose it job. The Graphics here are dated, but decent...Except for one thing. I don't know either it's my computer or the game, but the textures here keep flickering, even showing some objects as well. Even worst, it kept on flickering and flickering every f***ing time when I move! Again, it dose it job, but it's shotty at best.\n\nSound: Well...Somewhere in this world, Tomlinson Holman and James A. Moorer are sheding a tear with these sound design. Just play it to even believe it's majesty! In other words: It sucks. Also the voice acting...*Faceplams*\n\nGameplay & Controls: Well, the good news is the controls are basic, but fuctional. And that's good. At least you can give all those cheap FPS games a break in the controls, their basic, but good. Well, most of the time. The Gameplay in the other hand...Dear lord. Someone might as well change the title from The Stalin Subway: Red Veil to Survive KGB Gunfire Simulator 2006; Because it is unfair! I mean, the first second of playing the game you're getting shot at by two men with FRIGGIN' PPHS-41s! And you going to die. A lot. In a unfair way. Outnumber. Outgun. Outhope. I know what you thinking, yes. I am fully aware that you are outgun, outnumber, etc. and you have to fight your way through the fire and the flames to win the game, but...At least make it fair. This...I was amused by the quality of the game to get angry at it's Gameplay. Dose that count as a good thing if you get stoned by the quality of the game, instead of it's gameplay? With everything else going wrong, the controls are berly supporting of what seems to be a promising game.\n\nOverall: I am glad I played this game. Because at least ONE game works in the The Stalin Subway series. But it fails miserably. I played an hours worth of this game, hoping for a game that's is so bad it's good kind of way, but jezz...Well, at least some good came from this: Controls are basic, but works. Graphics are decent, if isn't flickering. Everything else though, sucks. And, oh yeah. Before I forget, I got two trading cards from this game. One called: Urgent Call, and the other: Will be together again. I sell them both. Urgent call is now worh a penny. But the second one is SUPER, ULTRA,HYPER,UBER,GLORIES,STALINIST rare,and I price it at all-time high of...2 pennies. At least one thing: I got this for only 74 cents. Now I'll need 71 more cents to get my money back.\n\nPros:\n-Controls are basic, but good\n-Decent graphics\n\nCons:\n-Terrible Voice acting\n-Miserable Gameplay\n-Flickering graphics\n\nScore: 2/5-Not Recommend","April 7, 2015","false","0.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Random_Idiot/recommended/311120/","Random_Idiot","RandomIdiot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Random_Idiot/","119 products in account","GAMEPLAY The gameplay is quite bare bones as it is, but the addition of a sniper rifle and also a flamethrower are nice when compared to the first game - though other weapons have been left out this time. Even so, all you need to know is that the only good weapon is the PPSh. The second best weapon is crouching. All you need to do is close in on enemies, then crouch and spray. Bullet richochets are in the game, but unfortunately fairly useless... it just serves to get you killed if you decide to spray across a metal surface. But to be fair, that is why there are enemies with metallic body armour in the game (just like in the first game if I remember correctly), as historically used by some Soviet assault engineers. Other than that, it can be tedious to find the right door or objective to activate... just like in the first game.\n\nSOUND The voice acting is quite bad. Even now I am unsure if these are actually NA/UK actors hired to do the English voices while trying really hard to use a Russian accent, but failing... OR that these are actually Russian actors hired to do English voices while trying really hard, but failing. Either way, I don't hate their attempts, but it should be pointed out that the quality of it is just... quite bad. The music, however, is quite good and fits the game well.\n\nBUGSNext, the elephant in the room. Elephant-sized BUGS. To be fair the game itself runs great, it's just... getting it to run at all is the problem for most people. In my case, I can only run it windowed and it refuses to go above 640x480. That definitely made the game more challenging for me, sitting behind a 1920x1200 monitor. Likewise, some people can't play this at all because of their hardware, just getting a white screen at most. It's rather disappointing. There is a fix available on the official Russian site. It's not that hard to find, even if you do not speak Russian, but the problem is that the fix may not actually fix this problem for everyone. It did nothing for me. It's a bit like playing Russian Roulette... either this game will work for you in some way, or it does not.\n\nCONTENTRegardless, none of this matters if the content of the game offers excitement. Unfortunately, even I had a hard time to get excited, mostly because of annoying moments like the infuriating "car chase". You are supposed to destroy an enemy car or two, but soon two trucks spawn with a lot of enemies that dismount. It seems impossible to kill them before they shred your health. They can shoot you from long range, you cannot crouch; you take hits from enemies in cars, can only turn 90-135 degrees which means enemies can shoot you in the back and you can only shoot the truck soldiers if they are dismounted, which is right before your car turns your back to them. The only way I passed this segment was because I quick-saved and -loaded, which despawned the soldier trucks completely... except for the wheels. Nice.\n\nThe escort missions near the end are also a pain in the rear. You must escort Glab, the heroine's lover, but if you stray too far from him enemies will spawn to attack him - a quick spree is enough for him to die. Your best bet is to stay nearby, but that means waiting for him to move and since he is wounded, he slowly limps forward. This slowed down a short mission by a lot of time. Glab is also with you in the next level and he now shoots back. The only problem is that if you move towards the end of the final station... you randomly die. This is because that area is final area, you die if you go there early because we can't have invisible walls. Instead, you must go around the train, but a guard covers it from sandbags. Try to shoot him and you will discover he is invincible. I assumed it was intentional, to force the player to wait for the guard to reload until you move up behind cover. As you do so and get behind him, two more guards spawn - allowing you to kill all three. Clever, maybe, but silly. As you make it past them and go inside you find: a window suitable for sniping. Yes, the last segment of the game is covering Glab with a sniper rifle. However, there is one problem... Glab can randomly die from one shot. My best guess is that the AI can randomly make a headshot which grants the same damage multiplier as your shots against enemy AI. Meaning his health bar is pointless. Meaning the end is one big save and load fest.\n\nCONCLUSIONThe game is terrible, there is no way around it. But somehow, I still recommend it. Games like this are badly developed, but it does one thing right. It captures the charm of old games, though not at the same level of quality. It doesn't pretend it's the world's most serious work of art. It's also not a shameless cash grab. The game is what it is: a poorly developed FPS that challenges you to beat it once. Unfortunately, this game can be completed under 3 hours or less, comes with a ton of bugs from the moment you try to start it up and is generally not all that great. In fact, when you take into account that you will do quite a bit of savegame loading for cheap deaths or looking for objectives, I'd say the game can be completed in an hour... perhaps less for speedrunners. Despite being older (2006), it is quite a bad apple... but one that can be enjoyed for what it is and be used to fill your lone hours. This supplied me with more joy than stupid copy-paste FPS games we have to deal with these days, despite it being terrible.\n\nThat doesn't make this game good, this is still a pretty bad game... but it's the type of bad that can be loved. Taking the low price in consideration as well... I do not regret my purchase.\n\nI would recommend this game to you if you wish for a change of pace in terms of your FPS games and want a short game "with an old appeal" to complete.\n\nI would not recommend this game to you if you seek a game to invest more time in or at least offer you some replayability, or if you are afraid to gamble your money on a game that may not launch for you at all.","February 1","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Random_Idiot/recommended/311120/","Random_Idiot","RandomIdiot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Random_Idiot/","119 products in account","GAMEPLAY The gameplay is quite bare bones as it is, but the addition of a sniper rifle and also a flamethrower are nice when compared to the first game - though other weapons have been left out this time. Even so, all you need to know is that the only good weapon is the PPSh. The second best weapon is crouching. All you need to do is close in on enemies, then crouch and spray. Bullet richochets are in the game, but unfortunately fairly useless... it just serves to get you killed if you decide to spray across a metal surface. But to be fair, that is why there are enemies with metallic body armour in the game (just like in the first game if I remember correctly), as historically used by some Soviet assault engineers. Other than that, it can be tedious to find the right door or objective to activate... just like in the first game.\n\nSOUND The voice acting is quite bad. Even now I am unsure if these are actually NA/UK actors hired to do the English voices while trying really hard to use a Russian accent, but failing... OR that these are actually Russian actors hired to do English voices while trying really hard, but failing. Either way, I don't hate their attempts, but it should be pointed out that the quality of it is just... quite bad. The music, however, is quite good and fits the game well.\n\nBUGSNext, the elephant in the room. Elephant-sized BUGS. To be fair the game itself runs great, it's just... getting it to run at all is the problem for most people. In my case, I can only run it windowed and it refuses to go above 640x480. That definitely made the game more challenging for me, sitting behind a 1920x1200 monitor. Likewise, some people can't play this at all because of their hardware, just getting a white screen at most. It's rather disappointing. There is a fix available on the official Russian site. It's not that hard to find, even if you do not speak Russian, but the problem is that the fix may not actually fix this problem for everyone. It did nothing for me. It's a bit like playing Russian Roulette... either this game will work for you in some way, or it does not.\n\nCONTENTRegardless, none of this matters if the content of the game offers excitement. Unfortunately, even I had a hard time to get excited, mostly because of annoying moments like the infuriating "car chase". You are supposed to destroy an enemy car or two, but soon two trucks spawn with a lot of enemies that dismount. It seems impossible to kill them before they shred your health. They can shoot you from long range, you cannot crouch; you take hits from enemies in cars, can only turn 90-135 degrees which means enemies can shoot you in the back and you can only shoot the truck soldiers if they are dismounted, which is right before your car turns your back to them. The only way I passed this segment was because I quick-saved and -loaded, which despawned the soldier trucks completely... except for the wheels. Nice.\n\nThe escort missions near the end are also a pain in the rear. You must escort Glab, the heroine's lover, but if you stray too far from him enemies will spawn to attack him - a quick spree is enough for him to die. Your best bet is to stay nearby, but that means waiting for him to move and since he is wounded, he slowly limps forward. This slowed down a short mission by a lot of time. Glab is also with you in the next level and he now shoots back. The only problem is that if you move towards the end of the final station... you randomly die. This is because that area is final area, you die if you go there early because we can't have invisible walls. Instead, you must go around the train, but a guard covers it from sandbags. Try to shoot him and you will discover he is invincible. I assumed it was intentional, to force the player to wait for the guard to reload until you move up behind cover. As you do so and get behind him, two more guards spawn - allowing you to kill all three. Clever, maybe, but silly. As you make it past them and go inside you find: a window suitable for sniping. Yes, the last segment of the game is covering Glab with a sniper rifle. However, there is one problem... Glab can randomly die from one shot. My best guess is that the AI can randomly make a headshot which grants the same damage multiplier as your shots against enemy AI. Meaning his health bar is pointless. Meaning the end is one big save and load fest.\n\nCONCLUSIONThe game is terrible, there is no way around it. But somehow, I still recommend it. Games like this are badly developed, but it does one thing right. It captures the charm of old games, though not at the same level of quality. It doesn't pretend it's the world's most serious work of art. It's also not a shameless cash grab. The game is what it is: a poorly developed FPS that challenges you to beat it once. Unfortunately, this game can be completed under 3 hours or less, comes with a ton of bugs from the moment you try to start it up and is generally not all that great. In fact, when you take into account that you will do quite a bit of savegame loading for cheap deaths or looking for objectives, I'd say the game can be completed in an hour... perhaps less for speedrunners. Despite being older (2006), it is quite a bad apple... but one that can be enjoyed for what it is and be used to fill your lone hours. This supplied me with more joy than stupid copy-paste FPS games we have to deal with these days, despite it being terrible.\n\nThat doesn't make this game good, this is still a pretty bad game... but it's the type of bad that can be loved. Taking the low price in consideration as well... I do not regret my purchase.\n\nI would recommend this game to you if you wish for a change of pace in terms of your FPS games and want a short game "with an old appeal" to complete.\n\nI would not recommend this game to you if you seek a game to invest more time in or at least offer you some replayability, or if you are afraid to gamble your money on a game that may not launch for you at all.","February 1","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
