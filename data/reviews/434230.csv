Except where in Gems of War you're matching colors to use special abilities, in this game you're matching them to summon your 'fairies' to push back the baddie moving from right to left across the top of the screen.\n\nIt adds a great deal of urgency, as the baddies are constantly marching and once they reach the left side it's game over. You get to see the battles animated as they happen, which is a nice touch. The music and sound is great and the graphics are cute.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/7gHZx4VZvoU\n\nA little more could have been done to make the UI more computer-friendly, but it's still fine. This is obviously a tablet game, but if you're really into Match-3s, this is totally worth the cheap cost of admission.","February 29","true","2.4"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","1"

You gotta keep an eye on the grid as well as on the enemy progression, and collect mana to send fairies fight the evil. The enemies have different skills to disturb your plans, and the playgrounds also have some particularities to spice things up. There also are bosses ! All in all, the game is great, especially if you like match-3. It has an excellent value for the price asked, there are a lot of achievements, steam trading cards and steam cloud. Nothing wrong here, nothing to dislike :)","February 29","true","15.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Too cute makes me angry.\nOther than "cute" I do love a good challenge on the match 3.\nVery similar to bejewel, but more fast pace and unique twists.\nVery fun achievements as well as getting all three stars.\nI like this game a lot more than gems of war and puzzle quest.\nGems of war was fun and I enjoyed it.\nPuzzle quest was gloomy, boring, and slow to get into the game.\nThis is more of a relaxing, fast pace, quick thinking, match 3, w lil unique difficulties fun.","May 24","true","28.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

More RNG that strategy, you can get destroyed one round and 2 minutes later win no problem. You can purchase some upgrades, but they are really too little too late.\n\nZero replayability, barely playability.\n\nThere is a game on Kongregate.com called Dangerous Adventure, this is a bad version of that free game, go play it.","February 29","false","3.5"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","0"
