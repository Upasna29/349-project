With gameplay that is easy to learn but hard to master, I found myself addicted to The Treasures of Montezuma 4 in no time.\n\nGameplay consists of your standard Match 3 fair, swap the position of the tokens to match 3 of the same color to remove them from the board and score points.  The twist comes in with totems and power-ups that you purchase with coins earned by completing levels.  Chaining color matches will power up your totems and release their abilities onto the board. Determining which power-ups are most beneficial for each game board is where the real strategy comes in. Running out of time? Start chaining those oranges.  Find yourself stuck with few good matches?  Chain up a couple reds and let those fireballs fly.  Snap decisions and twitch reactions are required, especially when playing on Expert, but finally FINALLY earning Gold on that one level that's been giving you fits is so incredibly satisfying you'll want to keep playing until you can't possibly play anymore.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=396043035\nAnd there are plenty of game modes to play through.  Aside from Story mode which consists of 98 increasingly difficult boards, there's Puzzle where you can play through sets of specific games (Catch the Frog, Spring, Archaelogy, etc.) to earn collectibles, and Quest where certain objectives must be met on each board as you search for the missing pieces of a medallion.  The variety of games gives you lots of options depending on what you're in the mood mood for, whether it's the marathon session or just a quick fix.\n\nGood or bad, luck is a bit of a factor in the gameplay.  If you're stuck with a bad board layout, it's often better to restart the level and hope for better token placement than waste time trying to work with the wrong totems.  Sometimes you just don't have enough of the right color to pull off the chains you need; however keeping a level head and planning your moves and power-ups wisely can help you overcome some of the bad luck.  Then there are the boards where everything lines up so perfectly that you snag Gold within seconds of starting despite trying dozens of times to beat the timer.  Sure, that's luck for you, but I choose to believe that I'm just that awesome!\n\nUnfortunately, the rate in which you purchase your power-ups can be a bit slow.  The game plays best when you have all the tools at your disposal to deal with any given situation.  Later levels tend to be more enjoyable because you have most of your power-ups which makes things a lot easier to deal with.  On the other hand, purchasing abilities one at a time helps teach what each does without confusing you too much, so there is some merit to it.  But the game is most fun when you're fully empowered and chaining like a madman as power-ups, explosions and multipliers rack up your points.\n\nAs one of the best impulse buys I've made on Steam, The Treasures of Montezuma 4 does not disappoint. If you are looking for more relaxing and casual fair, however, this may not be the game for you. But if you're in the market for a fast-paced and rewarding Match 3 title that will have you playing to the wee hours of the morning, you cannot go wrong with this gem! Even at full price, it's a steal. Steam achievements and trading cards are just icing on this already delicious cake.  Move over Bejeweled, there's a new king in town!\n\nBottom Line: Highly recommended for all Match 3 lovers and is a worthy addition to any gamer's library.","March 4, 2015","true","65.7"," 94 of 99 people (95%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","95","94","99","5","9"

Despite being a match 3 game The Treasures of Montezuma 4 does have a story behind it. You play as Anna, an adventurer who has gone to an ancient Aztec ruin with the aim of uncovering the ancient secret of Emperor Montezuma.\n\nWhile I'm not usually a fan of this kind of game this is one of the few Match 3 games I have really enjoyed playing.\n\n+Great graphics and loads of nice visual effects\n+167 levels to play through\n+Completing each level within certain time limits will earn you a bronze, silver or even gold medal\n+Some cool bonuses to unlock and upgrade with the coins you earn in-game, the higher your score the more points you earn which change how the game plays\n+Levels get progressively harder at a good rate\n+Lots of replay value if you're a perfectionist and want a gold medal on all of the levels\n+You can level up all the way to level 100\n+Three different game modes to enjoy: Story mode, Puzzle mode and Quest mode\n+Super addictive\n+Great music\n+Steam achievements and Steam Trading Cards\n\n+/-Your success in a level often depends on luck of the draw, if you're given a bad board layout to start a level chances are you aren't going to do particularly well, personally I wasn't too keen on this but others may not mind\n\n-Story isn't overly interesting\n-Not too many graphical options but that's just a minor issue\n\nVerdict:\n7.5\n\nA fun casual Match 3 game with nice graphics, loads of levels to play, several bonuses to unlock and good replay value, you should definitely pick this up if you're a fan of Match 3 games or just looking for a casual experience.\n\n***This review was written using a Key provided by the Publisher for review purposes***\n\nEl K.","April 11, 2015","true","8.2"," 55 of 71 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","55","71","3","4"

While the only difference from other match 3 games is different upgrade system and graphics, this game still is a good casual fun - it's obvious the overused gameplay formula still works.\n\nWhat's unique there is a motivation to match more groups of blocks with the same color consecutively. That triggers special totem events that does something to the game board, destroying the blocks or changing their color.\n\nThere's about hundred levels in basic story mode but after you beat this, there's also a Quest mode with even more levels - you don't have to worry this game would be too short.\n\nConclusion:I'd specify the target group to people who want to relax but don't want to play free game with microtransactions and ads (like Candy Crush Saga). If you belong into this group, The Treasures of Montezuma 4 is a nice pick on sale for you. Others, looking for some more original match 3 game, I'd recommend checking Claws & Feathers, also by Alawar Entertainment.\n\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","February 8","true","3.7"," 24 of 25 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","24","25","0","0"

It's not relaxing, your brain will constantly be on a heightened state of alert!!  It's a good feeling!\n\nThe mechanics are designed excellently, which is what makes it shine so well.  Once you're fully powered up by progressing through the game you'll have access to totem bonus's which are activated by creating chains of two or more  matches.  Each of the totem's has a different bonus effect.  You also make bonus effects by matching 4+ at the same time.  So there is a lot of opportunity for effecting the game.  There can be some wonderful moments of scoring when you start chaining bonus's and totems together, it's possible to clear the whole board and get some massive scores, and it feels satisfying!\n\nI've clocked 25 hours currently and am still finishing the game and chasing achievements.  There are multiple game modes which you score gold, silver and bronze in.  As with all match-3 games there is an element of luck involved but you can battle against this with your skills, reactions and an eagle eye!\n\nThe music is pretty cool too!\n\nI'd highly recommend Treasures of Montezuma 4, if you want a fast-paced match-3 game there is no better.","August 21, 2015","true","27.8"," 26 of 31 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","26","31","0","2"

I've gotten pretty much all out of it when it was first released, and was delighted to see it on Steam as well.\nI have played all games of the Treasures series, and the fourth one was probably the best. Those who have played the other games will find many familiar features, plus some very interesting new ones, like multiple game tasks. All in all, this is a very well made high-end match-three game ­-- it even has a storyline (a rather mind-blowing one for match-3 game, by the way) with voice narration this time. Special thanks goes out to whoever did the music and cut scenes, but really, everything about how the game looks and sounds seems great.\nOne warning for people like me, who generally would prefer a slower pace - although there is a relaxed mode, where you never lose a level because of slow play, your experience points and the money for buying power-ups is dependent on making a prescribed time per level. Times are gold, silver, or bronze, and there are corresponding point and coin ranges. If you miss out on bronze time, you get no points and no coins.\nIt is possible to play the game with few power-ups, but it isn't really any fun, so the game definitely pushes you to play fast, which can be frustrating if you're not able to improve in that area. The times are somewhat generous, and in some modes skill will definitely help you to a good time, but still, if you cannot (or choose not to) play relatively fast, you should approach this game with some caution.\nAnyway, after some time with the game, I've got the hang of it, and now even start to feel satisfied with all that fast-paced action.\nAnd, finally, it seems that Steam version loads and generally works a bit faster and more smoothly than the early one, which is one more reason to add it to your library here.","July 3, 2014","true","19.6"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","20","21","0","0"

Also has a Quest mode akin to some of the one-off weirdness in BJ3 so yeah, got everything the 'reigning champion' does and then some.\n\nNot convinced yet? This game features a match-3 endboss battle vs. Hernán Cortés, who escaped into an Aztec portal centuries ago and somehow became a magic-hurling werewolf.

I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who looking for nice casual game to relax.\n\nYes, it's seems nice and colourfull, idea with totem mechanics sounds very interesting, but there is one big problem: if you want to get reward for your gameplay, you'll need hell of luck. Some levels you can beat only if you lucky. You can get one or two nice matches from very start, got combo and complete level in 10-15 seconds, or you can match tokens on the very same level for 5 freaking minutes and lose. You can lose levels with frogs or fire/ice/gold tokens just because you won't get any of these for 2 minutes. Just a pure luck (or bad luck in that case).\n\nDon't get me wrong: I clearly understood the fact that ToM4 is just a casual 'match-three' game. But even a casual game usually require a skill to beat them on high difficulity, and if you have that skill, you'll beat the game, 'cause your results won't rely on solely luck. For ToM4 you'll need only pure luck to win. Not got enough green tokens to match them two times in row in first 10-15 seconds? Forget about gold-tier score, you won't get it for that time. Last tile in 'Match Pairs' placed in corner of the table? Pretty like you won't manage to open it, unless Red or Blue Totem'll destroy that part of table. And so on, and so on.\n\nThat's... That's awful for casual 'match-three' game. Game that won't allow you to win without any significant reason is not a game that you want to play for fun.","November 8, 2014","false","96.7"," 21 of 30 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","21","30","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/recommended/301150/","nourl1","Two Clicks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/","547 products in account","VERDICT: Fun, stylish, varied and engrossing, with that just-one-more-go feeling.  Games of Monetzuma 4 are fast paced and filled explosive action, with fast fluid gameplay despite a fair amount of repetition.  The variety of level challenges ensures that you rarely get bored and the learning curve is just right until you reach a good mastery of each game mechanic, required to complete the game.  That and some patience and stamina.\n\nProduction is excellent and it doesnt feel like you are playing what is essentially a tablet game or an indie title.  All mechanics and elements work sublimely together giving an explosion of sound and colour that makes playing the game such joy.\n\nMatch three nirvana!\n\n... More info below ...\n\n01. GENRE: Casual Match 3 with story elements.\n\n02. SETTING: The game is based around an imaginary Inca temple and setting.\n\n03. STORY/BACKGROUND: You take on the role of an up and coming archeologist Anna, who is a direct descendent of Emperor Montezuma.  Your aim is to uncover an ancient secret and reunite Montezuma with is beloved wife.  To do this you must complete the challenges to unlock the knowledge of the distance past.\n\n04. GAME MODES: There are three game modes: the campaign, puzzle challenges and the quest.  Together they form a varied and challenging amount of levels, with many different objective types and mechanics to make each game different and interesting the previous ones.\n\nThe campaign comprising of 6 chapters of 14 levels.  These levels have singluar objectives and are easy to straightforward to complete if only against the clock.\n\nThe puzzle mode consists of 8 different challenge types with mechanics that work in parallel to match 3, like revealing hidden treasures beneath the tokens/board or smashing the ice covering some tokens by repeating using match 3.  Each challenge has 8 short quick-fire levels which when completed release an valuable collectors item that form a collection where all items must be obtained.\n\nFinally the quest mode has multiple objective levels.  Each completion of the puzzle mode sees the player move towards one of four temples each of which main contain two parts to Montezuma's fabled face-mask.  Find both items and complete the quest.  You do not have to complete all objectives to progess unless you want to achievement perhaps the hardest achievement.\n\n05. GAMEPLAY/MECHANICS: Gameplay consist of your basic Match 3 mechaincs.  At its core you must match three or more tokens (tiles) to collect points. Multiple sequential matches of the same coloured tokens provide chains which trigger totems.  These provide much needed bonuses which can obliterate the tokens in play and award copious amounts of points to your score.  Using these basic methods you can clear a level or its objectives in quick-time, circumventing the need to spend the limited time you have to complete a level.\n\nCompleting a level gives you experience points and a certain amount of coins. The more games of match 3 you complete the higher your level.  The higher your level the larger the temple.  You must get to max level to complete the game.  There are 100 levels in total.   Coins allow you to buy up to 14 unlocks which make completing level easier.  These include: greater effects on matching 3 or a certain color, providing additional time, changing token colours, arming tokens with dynamite, etc.  Each unlock can be upgraded four times to make using it highly effective.\n\nOnce you have all the unlocks you will still need to collect coins to unlock 12 temple collectibles which are just furniture, for another achievement\n\n06. ENEMIES: No enemies here except the clock.  All levels must be completed with the time-limit given, which can be extended through unlocks and matching chains.\n\n07. LEVEL DESIGN: An excellent variation of challenging levels and game modes provides plenty to do and never gets boring even after 50+ hours.\n\n08. A.I: No A.I required as there are no enemies.\n\n09. CONTROLS: Simple mouse point, click and drag.\n\n10. GRAPHICS: Bright. Colourful. Excellent.  All graphic elements fit perfectly into the setting and the Inca theme.  One of the high-points of the game.\n\n11. SOUNDTRACK & AUDIO:  Sound is very atmospheric, with most tunes a variation on a theme.  There are different tunes for different puzzles.  If you're not a fan of pan-pipes you can always mute the musical score and whack on an M-player.\n\n12. VOICE ACTING: The only voice acting can be found in the cutscene at the start of the game and the six end-of-chapter cutscenes in the story mode.  All are brief but top notch.\n\n13. CHALLENGE/DIFFICULTY: The game provides a pretty good learning curve.  It may not be difficult to match three titles but to do so and complete the various objectives within the time-limit gets really taxing the further you progress with each game mode.  Provides an engrossing and ultimately a frustrating challenge, if only at the very end to clear those last free achievements.\n\n14. PROBLEMS: No problems to speak of.  Once you understand which tokens (tiles) to manipulate and when to get the bonuses you should enjoy playing the game.\n\n15. ACHIEVEMENTS: An almost perfect selection of achievements from those easy to get ones when learning the game to those few taxing ones at the very end.  Achievements consist of those required to complete each game mode, using certain mechanics and acquiring all collectibles.  An almost perfect set of balanced achievement is spoiled only at the very end, by needing to spend five or so hours grinding for the coins needs to complete the temple upgrades and find any the elusive puzzle collection items.  But they are not far off being perfect.\n\n16. DLC: None but there are other versions of this game available.\n\n17. PLAYTIME: In total I completed the game modes in 40 or so hours.  All achievements took another 10 additional hours to complete.\n\n18. LONGEVITY/REPLAYABILITY:  How long have you got?  You can of course replay any of the game modes as the puzzle mode collection can be continued until you tire of it and the quest mode can be reset multiple times.  So in theory you can play and replay infinitely or until you find something new.\n\n19. ENJOYMENT/APPEAL: Will appeal to casual players, fans of match 3 (tiles) or those who want kill a few minutes in between their main sources of video-game leisure.\n\n20. VALUE FOR MONEY: Excellent.  For an app game it actually plays well on the PC unsurprisingly.  Its one of those titles worth the recommended price.  Though if you wait for a sale you'll get more bang for your buck.","April 27, 2015","true","47.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Pretty much the same thing can be said about the game's audio. The visual and audio can be adjusted in the game's option menu.\n\nGameplay\nThe objective of this game is rather simple. Match 3 or more tokens (horizontally or vertically) to clear them from the board. The scoring varies from how many tokens has been matched. Also, how much time is left on the timer.\n\nThere special bonuses to help making matches a bit easier. There are totem bonuses and token bonuses. These bonuses can be unlocked at certain point in the game. Gold coins are required to purchase and upgrade them. Gold coins are earned from playing the match 3 levels. There is a negative side in having totem bonuses because it requires the same color tokens to be matched two or three more times before it becomes activated.\n\nThere are two different game difficulty modes to choose from: Casual and Expert. The only difference between these two difficulty modes is how fast the timer depleted in the timer bar.\n\nThere are three different game modes: Quest, Story and Puzzle. Story mode is already unlocked but Quest and Puzzle game modes are locked. Quest game mode can be unlocked only after the Story game mode is completed. The puzzle game mode becomes unlock after completing the first puzzle in the story game mode.\n\nIn the story game mode there are over ninety-eight levels altogether. Seven different totems with fourteen levels each. The first totem is unlock, while the remaining totems are locked, completing the totem will unlock the next one.\n\nIn the puzzle game mode there are eight different puzzles to solve. These puzzles come with a collections of items. Completing the puzzles will unlock them.\n\nIn the quest game mode contains series of task objectives that needs to be completed.\n\nAll of the match 3 levels can be replayed for a better score.\n\n[Please do note that you can continue playing when the timer runs out. You won't earn any coins to upgrade the bonuses. This only applies to the story mode part of the game.]\n\nMiscellaneous\nThere are total of five different trading cards. You only get the three of those cards from the game. There are several ways to get the rest of the trading card: Purchased from Steam's Market; Trade with friends; Booster Packs and it's Booster Pack Creator. This feature is only available Steams version of the game.\n\nFinal thoughts, it's an okay game, there's nothing much to it. As for the game's replay value it's low. I would recommend this game for those who enjoy playing match 3 games. Also, I wouldn't recommend buying this game at the full price.","December 9, 2015","true","49.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

It's not because it's lacking in originality of course, but this game is full of little problems that make the experience less relaxing than it should be.\nThe graphics are beautiful, but the various power-ups and backgrounds tend to quickly make the board confusing. This is a major issue to me because I'm not playing 'Where's Waldo', I'm playing a match-3.\nThe music is fine, but after a while it'll either stop playing, or it'll go on a one-second loop which makes things worse. I'd recommend to just disable it. The English is pretty broken from time to time. I'm pretty anal about that. Even more when it gets in the way of understanding what you're supposed to do. Loading times are really long for a mostly 2D game. CGI scenes are amateurish at best.\nStory mode is a bit too long (took me nearly 10 hours to finish), while Quest mode, which is unlocked by finishing the story, has nothing special to it. The game expects you to finish it with bronze trophies and then redo all levels to finish them in gold. Yeah, sure, like I have time to do that. Of course it's fine if I'm adopting this as one of the games I run when I'm bored, but this isn't going to happen, due to all the problems mentioned aboved.\n\nI still liked the game overall, but there are better alternatives out there. Only buy if on sale. Will keep on 'not recommended' for now, I'll revisit in a few months if I've ended up playing this on a regular basis.","January 20","false","10.7"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

ToM is a match 3 series where the main twist is that you can activate various powers by matching the same color twice. In the first game (which isn't on PC), your exciting and straightforward goal was to match up a quota of specially marked tiles before time ran out. But this fourth game switches between several different gimmicky goals, none of which is very satisfying. There's still a brutal time limit... but only for getting a gold rank on the level, because there's no way to fail a level, and you get to progress regardless of how long you take. Doing poorly doesn't give you as much money to unlock better power ups, but you'll always get to move on to the next level so who cares. (Basically the game does the equivalent of dumping a poor student in the "remedial" math class that's so full of delinquents and idiots that no one learns anything, but they all 'graduate' anyway). And even if you decide to take the game seriously and try to get gold on every level, you'll be slowed down by the distracting animations of the powers activating, and the matched blocks' exploded fragments raining down ON TOP OF THE BOARD THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO SEE WHILE THE CLOCK COUNTS DOWN EVERY PRECIOUS SECOND.\n\nOne of the other reviews mentioned that (SPOILERS!) a time traveling Cortez shows up, so I was hoping for wacky characters like the cannibal ogre in the first Puzzle Quest but so far it's been just "MATCH COLORED TOKENS TO MAGICALLY EXCAVATE THE TEMPLE!"\n\ntl;dr - Go play the first Montezuma game if you've got an iPad, or I guess go play Bejeweled if you want a PC equivalent.","July 30, 2014","false","4.9"," 3 of 13 people (23%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","23","3","13","0","0"

I bought Montezuma, Montezuma 2, & Montezuma 3 from a different online store (Big Fish Games) and I love those games! I just recently found out that they had a fourth one and since it was on Sale on Steam I decided to buy it! It's an absolutely wonderful game! Definitly tops the first and second one, the third one and this one have about the same graphic quality but I like how this one incorporates an actualy storyline in it! Helps make gameplay a little more intersting! Not to mention something you'll find in this one compared to the other three is "Challenges." There are lots of challenges that you can play and re-play including stuff like trying to catch as many frogs as possible or trying to get the water to the plant in time. And like in the past three games, you still have the usual match 3 elements and the store is still present, but personally I liked the one from Montezuma 3 better as you actually had a choice in what you wanted to buy. Usually there is only one or two things you are allowed to buy at a time compared to five or six in Montezuma 3. But I won't complain much about it because all the powerups are still there from the previous games plus some new ones! And they can really help your gameplay, especially when you get into the harder levels!\n\nOverall this is a great Match 3 game! It can definitely be very relaxing but it can also be very intense at times! If you are a fan of Casual and/or Relaxing Games or have played games like Bejeweled or Fishdom and you enjoyed them then I definitely think you will really enjoy this game! (And don't worry, you don't have to have the other 3 in order to understand what's going on! This is the only game to date with an actualy storyline in it so you won't miss too much!) With that being said, if you are not a person who likes Casual Games then I'm not 100% sure if you will find this game enjoyable. If you do, then I find the price of $6.99 very reasonable since usually for games like this I pay at least $9.99.\n\nI recommend this game if you enjoy Match 3 Games or Casual Games!","February 15","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
