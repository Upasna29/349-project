Well worth the low price they ask.\nI'm going to focus on the negative, since I love everything else about the game.\nI'm not focusing on the negative because it's a bad game, but because if these areas were improved on, the game would be even better than it already is!\n\nCons:\n#1, There's not many building options, a plant and a statue for decoration, ETC\n#2, Each project is stuck to a fixed number of team member, like micro being 2, instead of "minimum required"\nI would like to take my extra workers not doing anything and tell them to work on a project.\nSay I have 3 workers, I'm 1 short of making a small game, I can't tell him to work on the micro game with the other 2 guys. In my opinion, it should be a minimum requirement on how many staff work on the game.\nIf I make a large game, it would just make sense that every single time I'm not stuck to exactly 20 staff members, I should be able to throw on another 10, to speed things up.\n#3, You're stuck at a max of 50 workers, I'd like to have more\n#4, You're stuck at working on a maximum of 5 projects at a time, no way to upgrade or change this.\n#5, Fullscreen was not working (though I'm sure this will be fixed)\n#6, The bar at the top was way too small, I had issues seeing various things on the screen, and I don't need glasses\n#7, When a worker had nothing left to do on a project, he just sleeps and you can't have him do anything else until the project is done, not even train him!\n#8, When you move an object and it checks which tiles are free, it thinks where it previously was is not free tiles.\nFor example, if I move an object 4 tiles big, and I want to move it 1 tile to the left, I need to move it to another spot at least 2 tiles away, then back to the spot I actually want it, due to it thinking its own spot isn't free because "Hey, I can't move there, I'm in the way!"\n\nThose were the biggest issues for me, not issues that ruin the game, but I feel in my opinion if they were adressed then the game would be so much better!\n\nThank you devs for the really cool game!","October 2, 2015","true","15.6"," 125 of 137 people (91%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","91","125","137","9","5"

I will add a TL;DR at the end.\n\nGameplay\nThis game seems to be a mix of Prison Architect and Game Dev Tycoon as you play through it. You start out by doing the obvious and naming your company, then you hire workers, start making crappy games, make slightly better games, make great games, and so on. You set your workers into 4 categories to work within for a game (Art, Sound, Code, and Writing) and each game requires more or less of each of these. The building capabilities seem to be limited and the options are decent. The game is fun but the objectives do not catch the eye (took me a while to notice them), no option to pause time so you can set up a game or look around, and the date is only seen if you mouse over the clock. I feel like there is a clear lack of customazation to your game studio. I also noticed that as I name a game, the CPU studios have longer names than I am even allowed for my games.\n\nGraphics/Sound\nThe Graphics are smooth and overall polished. The music was suprisingly good and I was able to enjoy it.\n\nSuggestions\nThese are my suggestion for the game which I feel would improve the current state. Please remember these are my personal opinions.\n\n- More customization to the building\n- Ability to hold down mouse and multi-place (like with walls)\n- Date being shown in the top right and being visible\n- Objective being more highlighted\n- Ability to choose your aimed audience for the game (child, baby, adult, teenager, etc)\n\nPros/Cons\nPros\n\n+ Cheap\n+ Music is nice\n+ Overall enjoyable with gameplay\n+ Triple-speed option\n+ Critics are funny\n+ Each game genre requires different amount of each skill\n+ Award ceremonies\n\nCons\n\n- No building customization (from what I see so far)\n- Character limit for game naming is not that long\n- Date is not shown normally unless you mouse over clock\n- Objectives do not pop out\n- No real perk/ punishment depending on who you hire.\n- Can get repetitive\n- No pause option that allows you to take your time deciding on a game\n- No real depth\n- Game just stops selling after 1 year\n\nFinal Thoughts\nOverall I played this game and I didn't like it that much. There is no customization for your studio which I feel harms the game significantly. The music was nice and the concept is good but, it is really rought. I am sad to hear that it is 90% complete as it does not feel near that level of completion. There are a lot of things that just pick at you when playing (date only visible when you mouse over clock, no pause option while creating your game, objective is kinda annoying to see, etc.). The game simply feels unfinished to me.\n\nTL;DR\nGame Corp DX is a newly released indie simulator where you own a gaming studio. You create games, hire workers, and get hated on by critics. Overall this game is nice, but still lacks depth and customization along with other things. The game is still in the rough and I would encourage the dev to hold back on it's out of Early Acess release (october). It's got potential, but still has a ways to go. If you have the 3$ maybe you want to buy it, maybe you want a candy bar. So far the game seems far from complete and it saddens me to see that it is apparently 90% complete. In it's current state I can't say it is horrible, but I can't say it's good either.","September 6, 2015","false","2.4"," 160 of 212 people (75%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","75","160","212","11","17"

If you don't want to fork up the money for this, then go play that - this isn't much different. The graphics are the EXACT same, several features have been locked until later, and the creators still have no idea how to spell "ceremony". There are only a few new genres, the employees now have "personalities" (i.e they need to eat more often, almost all of them are negative), and you can finally pause the game and speed up those agonizingly long award ceremonies.\n\nI was confused at first by the lack of a proper UI. I saw the buttons on the bottom but I had to manually count all my employees, I later noticed there was a centimeter-tall transparent bar at the top of the screen that had the information.\nPlaying the game, I had a few issues. Mostly with the edge-scrolling - I'd alt+tab out of the game (because even in windowed mode, the game tries to keep its custom cursor outside of the game and prevents you from doing any OS things) and come back to find that the view was all the way in the corner. Apparently it edge-scrolls when the window isn't even maximized, so I just turned off edge scrolling. The music is a bit obnoxious and loops endlessly (just remembered the company's name is Endless Loop). Workshop integration sounds great until you realize that the only customizable parts of the game are the employee's faces and studio icons. Not that big of a deal but I was expecting custom genres or at least different items.\n\nOverall, the game - just like its original Flash game, is repetitive and lacking content. Absolutely nothing has changed in the way of graphics, it's a bit buggy, and feels unfinished, even for a game that just came out of Early Access. I don't like giving bad reviews, especially when it comes to simulation games, but this just isn't worth the price. Most of the positive reviews are sarcastic, but I wanted to provide some detail as to what exactly the game has in the way of content.\nThank you.","October 30, 2015","false","4.4"," 104 of 132 people (79%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","79","104","132","5","11"

Buy a few training computers and train each employee in 1 of 4 specializations:\nCode, art, sound, or writing\n\nHave them make micro size games that only require 2 employees. Make sure you select genres that are currently popular and assign the correct staff to the project. After they make around 3-4 games, they'll be maxed out in their specialization. Start making small games that require 4 staff and you'll get a 5 star rating every single time.

You don't create games for any specific device, you just make games, and you can only assign staff to projects in even numbers and still yet the increments are; 2,4,10, and 20. You can't assign any more or any less staff to projects. It's still pretty enjoyable and the office building is fun, but there are only about 10 total objects to place. The concept is unique, even with other game dev sim-type games, but the execution is sub-par.

In fact, it’s incredibly simple, and your general aim is to win every award, or at least some, at the award ceremony, which happens once a year. As you’d expect, you start with a little room, in which you have to hire some folks to help you start your wannabe award winning studios. After you’ve fully expanded, which consists of hiring everyone in the city, you’ll be offered the opportunity to relocate your studio to another city. Luckily enough, the room stays the same, as well as all the furniture. The changes are noticed on the exterior, and the ability to expand your walls, allowing you to buy more workstations, and therefore expand your team. You’ll also have to train your little minions, or else you’ll be stuck watching every other studio win an award, while you fight to survive.\nThere’s no real challenge to the game, as you’ll most likely always make a profit with every game. That said, it’s more of a casual game, with a pretty active developer that’s constantly participating on the forums, listening to suggestions and trying to solve any possible bugs.\nThe tutorial is also pretty helpful, as it’s supposed to be, and after it’s done, to offer some sense of continuity to the player, there are a number of objectives to reach which will reward the player with some money.\nAll of this is completed with a very comical and funny graphical style, which I enjoyed quite a bit. Although the same can’t be said for the music, which gets somewhat annoying after a while.\n\n\nPros Thorough tutorial;\nComical graphical setting;\nWide variety of NPCs;\nDiversified critics;\nEnjoyable gameplay;\nRequirements for each skill are shown during game creation;\nPrice;\nThe developer is quite active on his forums.\nConsidering it's an Early Access (EA) game, I've decided to add a "Neutral" category, for details I consider important, but not gamebreakers, and could easily improve the gameplay if attended.\n\nNeutral Could benefit with an automatic team funcionality, for the lazy folks;\nSome more cities to allow more space and a bigger team;\nA couple more objectives, to delay the inevitable end game repetitive feeling.\nWhen considering the “Cons”, there are a couple things to keep in mind, such as the fact Endless Loop is formed by a team of one, as well as GCDX’s low price, so the same level of polish as other bigger development teams have (as well as a higher price) can’t be expected. That said, there isn’t much to point out.\n\nCons Music gets annoying after a while;\nAside from the award ceremonies, there isn’t any other real contact with the NPC studios.\nVerdictWorth purchasing. While it certainly isn’t the best of the genre, its fast paced casual gamestyle, and comical setting will most definitely please some players. It’s also worth not forgetting the size of the team developing it, which consists of one person.","September 13, 2015","true","6.6"," 34 of 39 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","34","39","3","0"

Only.. not at all.\n\nYou're a game developer with a small bit of money and have to build a team up from nothing basically.  It's a time management and adventure type game.\n\nYou have to increase the skill of your workers in various specialties like Sound, Coding, Writing, etc.\nYour workers can get good enough at a specific skill to actually specialize in it and start learning new skills by learning new programs on training kiosks (that you build)  As their skills increase, so does the viability of your product.\n\nPicking genres that directly support your team's skill is definitely a cool part of the game.  Especially when you are in the midst if training to new skills and/or have new folks on your team.\n\nI really liked being given access to new training techniques and even the ability to "enhance" members of your team to get rid of bad habits like overeating or arriving late.

I used to play Game Dev Tycoon few months ago, it was the last good game dev simulation game.\n\nAfter few months Game Corp DX came out. It was in early acces, I stayed away cuz of bugs and some negative reviews. Just added it to my wishlist and got it on my birthday as a gift. LOL, I am lucky cause this game is totally awesome.\n\nThere is three difficulty mode ; Hard, Normal and Easy. Easy is really easy. You can learn the game basics as like as it's a tutorial. Then you can play normal or hard without getting bored easily.\nThe game mechanics are basic. You can build workplaces, training stuffs into your office/studio. You can recolate your studio from X to Y. You can hire new people with pros and cons. You can speciliaze your employees, remove their negative effects.\nThere is four specialities. Sound and Art Designer, Writer, Coder. You can specialize your employees with one of them.\n\nThere is four game sizes. Micro, Small, Medium, Large. Earning money is a bit hard after a time. When you get f.cked up, request loan from the bank. Making micro or small games always worth to get a shot. Well, the magazines like VGN and Kotokoo or whatever... are sonuva♥♥♥♥♥. Your employees have to work hard and train themselves to make a better game.\n\nAt last it feels more simulation and complicated than Game Dev Tycoon or any other else. You can earn awards in game festivals. Stats are (your own stats and global stats) verQy well designed. You can expand your capacity and studio. You can see that your studio is grow up with your very own eyes.\n\nI give my thanks to special dev/devs behind this game.\n\nThe only one con is making game projects are easy and not very complicated. So it means you can beat the game without getting tired. There is a lot of special thing in build mode, employee hire and management but not game projects. They could be similar or upgraded version of Game Dev Tycoon.\nAlso there is some framerate drops in studio with a lot of workers.\n\nPlease don't ask me as like 'Why are you comparing Game Dev Tycoon and Game Corp Dx' cuz Game Dev Tycoon is another succesful game dev management game for a long time.\n\nPS : There is dozens of funny easter eggs and achievements. You can hire Tim Schaffer, Sid Meier, Gabe Newell and you can make Half-Life 3 ! My dream come true!\nSome easter egg examples : DVD Projekt RED, VGN, Kotakoo, Telltail Games, Double Pine, Electronic Poptarts etc.\n\nSCORE : 79/100","December 13, 2015","true","12.3"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","20","23","3","0"

I'm a brazilian guy (sorry about the poor english) and there are some things that I like to say about this game:\n\nPositives:\n- The game price is amazing! Very cheap!\n- The tutorial is amazing fun and instructive. Just pass through the tutorial and you will be fine for the rest of the game.\n- The game has great background sound. I love it.\n- The animations are simple but they are great! They are very fun and attractive.\n- The workers can have some feats and I really like that. This make the team composition very interesting.\n- The specialization mechanic is really cool. Maybe, if were possible add some more specializations, like gamedesign, physic, etc, or maybe split some existing specializations, like split code in design and codification, split art in art 2D and art 3D, etc, maybe this could improve the creation of games mechanic.\n- The awards show is great! I really enjoy.\n\nNegatives:\n- The Gane Corp Dx core is very, very simple. This can be a great thing for some people but personally, I prefer a game with more challenges, where you should understand more things to get far.\n- I miss the creation of engines and some other things which can be part of the game creation process. Maybe include creation of game engines, art plattaforms, physic engines and things like that could improve the Game Corp Dx core.\n- The build system could be better. I dont like to select some tools to move things and select other one to sell things. It is painfull. These ones should be integrate. Maybe move a thing should be just grab it and release it and sell a thing should be select the thing and click on a simple button which could appears at the top of the thing.\n\n\nThat is. If you are looking for a simple and very funny game about games, Game Corp DX is made for you. If you are looking for a game that you will play casually, Game Corp Dx is made for you. But, if you are a person that is interest in a bit more hardcore games where you will have to think, learn things and spend some time to make the best decisions, maybe Game Corp Dx is not made for you.\n\nOverall, I really recommend this game because it is fun, it has a giant potential and the developers are being amazing about the community reviews and they are attempting bring the things that are being asking for.\n\nBy the way, I have a YouTube channel where I make let's play, gameplay and tutorial videos about games (in portuguese). Some Game Corp Dx videos will be there on the next week, at the follow link: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2S71tvncmhlyiLRaqvkmtP2Xpz42cWPD . If you are interest, there are a lot of videos about strategy, grand strategy, base building and some other genres in the channel.

I was hoping it would have more depth to it like Game Dev Tycoon does, but you seriously just pick a game and let them fly... There's no sense of enjoyment or feeling of accomplishment at all. There's really no need to go into more detail than this - I like that you can set up the building and such, but there's not enough fun in just that. Unless this gets a Fun Patch ASAP, I'd just avoid it and play Game Dev Tycoon instead.","October 4, 2015","false","1.4"," 94 of 159 people (59%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","59","94","159","11","8"

Unfortunately, releasing shallow and dull games seems to have become a trend recently. Unlike Game Dev Tycoon (which I really loved), Game Corp DX feels like it was designed without any effort to make it challenging or even interesting enough to play for too long. Everything feels easy and meaningless, as if it was just another step towards an achievement. I get no satisfaction at all from publishing a good game, as it hardly requires any effort. To get to the next stage ("Relocate" to another city), all I need to do is hire all available workers in the current city, which is too easy on one hand, and unrealistic on the other.\n\nKk, I'll stop ranting now.

But then I asked myself what I could lose buying a game with a price like 1.5 $ (in my country it is sold for roughly that amount). The game just got me in the very first second with its charming graphics and easy mechanics. Basically, it is a tycoon game in which you hire/train developers, design your workplace in a simple way and create games. There are also 28 objectives that you need to complete in order to "finish" the game. Of course, you can continue playing, but after that point the game becomes repetitive and you will not find any reason to continue playing. To finish all those objectives and get the achievements, I spent about 5 hours, and I can definitely say that the game did not get boring or repetitive in this period. As developer claimed that the intention was to create a 4-5 hour game, it can be said that this intention is fulfilled.\n\nLong story short: If you are a fan of tycoon games, definitely get this game. If you are looking for a game tycoon game with a longer lifetime, you can check out Game Dev Tycoon.\n\n-------------\n\nOyunu almadan önce biraz kararsızdım, ancak oyunun fiyatı 4.6 TL iken ne kaybederim diye düşünüp oyunu aldım. Oyun akıcı mekanikleri ve sevimli grafikleri ile direkt sizi içine çekiyor. Basitçe, oyun klasik bir tycoon oyunu. İşçi buluyor, onları eğitiyor, çalışma alanımızı dizayn edebiliyor ve oyun üretebiliyoruz. Oyunda toplamda 28 tane görev var ve bunları tamamladığımızda oyun "bitiyor". Tabii, isterseniz devam edebiliyorsunuz ancak o noktadan sonra oyun kendini tekrar etmeye başlıyor ve oynamak için bir neden kalmıyor. Oyunu bitirmek ve tüm kazanımları tamamlamak benim 5 saate yakın zamanımı aldı, bu süreçte oyun hiçbir zaman sıkıcı olmadı veya tekrara düşmedi. Geliştirici de zaten 4-5 saatlik bir oyun deneyimi yaratmak üzere yapmış oyunu, amacına ulaştığını söyleyebilirim.\n\nUzun lafın kısası: Eğer tycoon oyunlarını seviyorsanız, kesinlikle bu oyunu da deneyin.

I enjoyed it and I look forward to the whole game being polished, with new features implemented in it. However, I feel the game has no real replay value so after you're gone through the whole thing once (which can take a few hours), there's no real incentive to play again. The waiting is one of the biggest problems in the game in my opinion. Once you are in the game and a project is in progress, there's nothing to do other than watch the screen, especially with larger games which take a lot of time.\n\nI do however like the awards thing they do every single "year", and seeing your achievements compared to the other companies. I think the rewards should stack up. The moment you reach end game as well, you can't do anything with the money except watch it  increase.\n\nThere are at the moment no achievements, so it is hard to keep playing as there isn't a sense of reward about the game that makes you keep going after the next hurdle. However, the achievements are being added soon so I'm looking forward to that.\n\nGraphics\nGraphics wise it's really basic , but also cartoonish which helps make up for it. The movements look comical, especially at faster speeds. Maybe it will help to give more reactions to the workers such as triumph when a project is completed, frustration. Also the workers all appear to be only males, I also think it could be improved by having have both male and female workers, though the difference would really be more in the names\n\nControls\n\nThe controls are mouse based, you click for everything.  I would like to use the keyboard so I can be more lazy.\n\nSound\n\nThe sound is really addictive and relaxing but it gets boring after a while because the tunes I can hear are alike. It does help to keep you awake which is cool. A bit more variety in this would make it a lot better, since you would eventually mute the sound and put on your own after hearing the same thing over and over.\n\nOverall Verdict\n\nThe game itself has a lot of potential if you consider that this is just an early access game, so a lot more can be done to make it more productive. If you enjoy looking at the progress in games in early access, I would recommend getting it. If you don't, I would wait until after it's fully updated and if there is more replay value added to it.\n\n\n8.5/10\nWant moar?\nClick here to join my steam group and Click here to follow my curator page!","September 16, 2015","true","4.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","6","7","2","1"

After all, how good could a $2.99 Early Access title be?   When I started playing I was pleasantly surprised by it.  Rather than a short simplistic game, there appears to be real depth to this title.  There's enough going on this game that I've decided to just write the bulk of this review in + and - list form.\n\nGame Corp Dx features;\n\n+ Simple and intuitive graphical interface.  There aren't dozens of menus to navigate here, and it's pretty easy to figure out how to use the ones that are.\n\n+  Keyboard command can easily be remapped.  On behalf of the other left-handed gamers out there, thank you Devs.\n\n+ Servicable graphics, simple without feeling out dated.\n\n+ Clear path of progression.  I haven't played that long, but already it's pretty obvious to me that when I get enough cash  I'll get the option to move to another city with bigger and better game options to play with.\n\n+  At it's heart a tycoon game, but has some sim elements.  The player can expand and buy stuff for the office.  Also, there is an easy to use training option to improve the workers.   Also, the workers have needs such as hunger and thirst, so the player would do well to pay attention to how the design their office.\n\n+ Yearly game awards grant bonuses.  This turns out to be very nice indeed.  In other  game dev tycoon titles the awards shows just seem like an annoying break to the game flow, here they actually enhance the game play.\n\n+ Good pacing as far as the game speeds go.    Fast really does cut down on the waiting time for your team to develop a game, so staring a the screen just waiting is a minimized annoyance.\n\n+ Decent game auto-naming.  You can enter your own names, but I really am terrible at this sort of thing and end up with a library of RPG1's and the like.  It's nice to have the option of not dealing with it at all.\n\n+ Day and night cycle.  Not really sure it adds that much, but it is a touch of realism.\n\n+ Upon exiting the game, the user is prompted to write a steam review.  This left me with the impression that the Devs might really care what kind of gaming experience their user base is having.\n\nThis game isn't perfect, however.  Some of the downsides to Game Corp Dx are:\n\n- The interface can get in the way of the game play.  I found that after I played a short while the Objectives finshed and notification icons would block the Projects completed icon, making it hard to tell when a game was finished and ready to publish.\n\n- The overall pacing of the game has issues.  The Monthly progress reports are very intrusive and interupt the flow of the game.  Also, it seemed odd that time keep running when I was in one of the menus trying to set up the developement of a game or the training of an employee.   I really wished the game would just pause when I'm in any menu, not just the build men.\n\n- Speaking of pausing, it would be nice to have a pause icon next to the game speed icons on the interface clock.\n\n-  It would be less confusing if the worker specializations were writen out as art, writing, or whatever rather than crptic letters.  Using the ingame icons that represent the four components of a game would work fine also.\n\n-  Once you select a game genre, it would be very nice to be able to see the graphic of its core game component weights when assigning workers to them.\n\n-  It appears that only male employees are available for hire.  A fairly minor quibble, but if we have a day/night cycle for realism it seems slightly jarring that the game doesn't seem to know that women exist.  Note: I haven't advance very far in the game, so it is possible that they do turn up at some point.\n\nI'm still surprised that a game that cost under $3 has enough depth of game play to warrant this long of a review.  It honestly plays more like a five or ten dollar game.  Sure, it's not perfect, but the minuses are relatively minor and the core gameplay is fun.  If you are a fan of tycoon games, it would be silly of you to let this one slip by your library.\n\n8/10\n","September 5, 2015","true","12.3"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

You hire employee's with various Traits, both positive and negative, and set about making a game. They work on 4 areas of development: Coding, sound, graphics, and writing. When they do these jobs, they get experience, and the more experience they have, the faster they do it and the more "Quality" they generate, I'll explain Quality later.\n\nYou can have your employee's specialize in one of the 4 development areas: Code, Art, Sound, and Writing. If someone is specialized in Code for example, they do that aspect better than someone no specialization and full experience. They trade off is that they can't earn experience outside their specialization. You CAN remove specializations though, but they're expensive.\n\nAs for traits, they come in Positive and Negative Traits. Positive Traits are things like arriving to work earlier, working faster, producing better quality work, requiring less food and water, etc. Negative Traits are basically the opposite of the Positive traits, such as arriving to work later, lower quality work, needing more food/water, working slower, falling asleep frequently, etc. They can be removed with a purchasable work station, but they're somewhat costly, and take time to remove.\n\nWhen you start to make a Game, you choose a genre, where neglected genres generate more fans for you. You can name it too. Then you choose how big you want it to be: Micro, Small, Medium, Large. Those take 2, 4, 6, and 10 Employees respectively. The larger the product, the more it costs to produce. Then you choose who works on which of the 4 Aspects(Code/Art/Sound/Writing), the more you have on a Aspect, the faster it's done, and finally, which Software to use, where the more skilled an Employee is, the better the Software , and the better the Software , the better the quality. Then you start the project.\n\nAs your Employees work on the project, Quality is generated. More skilled Employees, better Software, and Larger Products  all generate more Quality. The higher the Quality, the better reviews it'll get and more it'll sell. Once the Project is complete, you Publish it, where you can choose what level of Advertising it'll get, and it'll sell better if you use better Advertising.\n\nIf you like game making Tycoons, definitely pick this up.

The only real challenge is knowing when to push through and when to borrow as the tutorial leads you, more or less, by the hand.  It is possible to make bad decisions and lose out, but with the daily autosave (a more or less standard feature these days), it's possible to take a different approach and get through it. That, however, isn't a bad thing at all.\n\nGraphically it's very nice with a simple UI and approach, yet tools are provided for the more hardcore players of this type of game. The music creates a nice ambience without being irritable, unlike some games. The price is low compared to some of the other "tycoon" style games out there and, although I feel it's worth a little more, it's not too short a sell.\n\nI would like to see more in the way of features and options, particularly once you get to the end game and are making millions per "day". The ability to set up additional studios or buy out competitors and put them to work on supporting projects for your AAA titles or some other way to invest/spend your money end game.\n\nHowever, the game plays very well without anything added to it and is good value for money. I look forward to seeing what these guys do in the future with the tycoon genre.

Many games these days can take years to make, cost millions of pounds and require a lot of people to work on them. It’s a big industry, but, for all the times you have played video games, have you ever considered giving it a go?\n\nGame Corp DX is based on the online flash game of the same name (minus the DX) and challenges players with the task of building a video games company from the bottom up. Players start out with a small building and need to hire and train staff members and create game projects for them to work on. When the game is complete, they will then need to publish it, check out the reviews and get right on to the next project; providing they still have enough money to make them. As the game moves on, players can hire more staff members, upgrade and relocate their base of operations to places around the world, work on bigger projects, while also keeping the books balanced and win big at the annual awards.\n\n“The game really does grab the attention of the player. It may be rather simple to look at and play, but there is an added level of depth in that you begin to panic when your money value is in the red”\n\nGame Corp DX is a pretty simple game to play as it mostly involves moving the camera around with your mouse, and clicking on objects and the interactive menu to do stuff. The graphics are presented in a nice 2D style with no real shading or angles, making it easy on the eye. The soundtrack is rather nice and pleasant and kind of reminds me of the soundtrack from Theme Hospital.\n\nThe game really does grab the attention of the player. It may be rather simple to look at and play, but there is an added level of depth in that you begin to panic when your money value is in the red. Creating the video games your company produces takes the form of a simple little selection of menus. Basically you just name the game, choose the genre, choose staff members with the best appropriate skills to produce the game and select from programs and resources to make the game. Then your workers will design and create it, followed by you publishing it, checking out the reviews, then hope it makes money. It’s a rather nice easy way of doing things, but you begin to care how well it does at the reviews stage, how much money it makes and if it wins big at the awards ceremonies.\n\n\nWhile it is a nice simple game, I feel that some bits of it are rather random. Games work depending on whether or not you have the right people with the right skills working on a game, but when it comes to making money, it just feels random as to how much money it takes and how well it does at the review stage. One moment you could produce a game that would put Halo to shame, but then you could release something worse than E.T. As soon as you hit your stride and are able to know how to make good games, it gets rather easy. There are some in-game trophies and challenges to complete, but once you know what to do, it just feels like the challenge is gone.\n\n\nAt best, Game Corp DX is a nice filler game. While it is rather addictive and you are able to get fully engrossed in the game, it does not offer much for long periods of gaming. It’s a game that is best played when you have some time to kill. It has some replay value but suffers from getting too easy once you get the knack of making games. It’s a nice little game but still has some issues in its current state; some of these are more technical such as not being in full screen mode when you first load it (something which you’ll need to change in the options menu). Despite the niggles though, it’s a pleasant way to pass a bit of time, and it’ll be worth seeing what updates are implemented before it’s out of Early Access.\n\n","February 4","true","12.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","3"

Updates come rapidly and really add something to the game.\nIt has been released now and is more finished than I could image, this is a great game and tends to steal your time away.\n\nAt the time of writing I played about one hour and is in early access.\nThis game is quite OK and was well worth the money. It tends to get a little repetitive after a while but quite challenging none the less. Sometimes the game feels a bit empty, and I hope the devs can work that out. For example, the amount of stuff you can place and the way information is revealed.\nWhen beginning a new project, the player has no clue about the number of available workers (and there skills!). So it is hard to pick a game that is more adaptive to the available skillset, I would like to see that changed.\n\nEvery year there are awards and it isn't easy to get more than 2 or 3 of them. You really have to put effort (strategy) into each minute of playing to get the most awards and revenue out of your business.\n\nUPDATE: There have been some tweaks to the game and I like them very much. For example, you can now put the game on pause without showing the menu. When paused you can also publish games and create projects. The latter one can take quite some time, so I'll use the pause button a lot.\n\n@devs:\n- What I'm still waiting for is a list of employees who have nothing to do BEFORE creating a new project. It is just weird that you create a new project for 10 people, click on next to find out there are only 3 available. (This has been fixed!)\n- Also there is a minor bug where you post-produce a large project where it tells you there aren't any free Master-workplaces though I have 2 available (which are then used by that project). No breaker, but still quite annoying. (This has been fixed!)\n\n9.5/10","September 5, 2015","true","7.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's not quite up to par with Game Dev Tycoon, but it has a lot of things that GDT is missing. One of my favorites is that games will keep selling over time rather than just going off market after a few months. You can work on multiple projects at once, alter your studio, and much more. I'm certainly enjoying this game and I'm sure it'll get even better as time goes on because, if I'm correct, it's early access.","September 5, 2015","true","0.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Sooo enjoyable.\n\nThe art style is lovely, the music is quirky, and the gameplay simple enough to get into easily.\n\nI would thoroughly recommend this!\n\nThings I would like to see before leaving early access:\n\n- More variety in the music: It did get a tad bit repetitive after a couple of hours.\n- A little less grind towards the end: The last 4 years of my game were pretty much the same over and over again.\n- A little more variety, one thing I like about Game Dev Story on iOS is that you have to try and match genres and types together and experiment a little, something like that, an extra mechanic, would make the game a little more interesting and probably fix the end game grind a bit.\n- Keep doing what you're doing!\n\nMaybe a Theme Hospital type setting for the next game ;-)","September 5, 2015","true","4.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

You can complete (win the game) in less than 8 hours playing slow speed. There are achievements to be had so you may have to play a few times to get all the achievements (no cheating please).\n\nWhat's good about the game. You can choose your team to make different size games. When you are making micro games, your experience is doubled! Your characters may have good and negative traits which may speed up, improve final quality or slow down the progress of your game creation. You do not have to deal with choosing a game title if you do not want to (default is a random name). Post production issues susch as marketing and manufacturing are automatically taken care of. You have competitors added to the game as you go along and your competitors get significant advantages so you have to step up if you want to win awards. The award system at the end of each year gives you bonuses which are very helpful (at least to me). The pathfinding worked for me. The music was fine in my book.\n\nWhat's so-so about the game. The graphics are Ok, not fantastic but good enough to get the job done. You can mouse over a character to find out who they are (that's nice!).\n\nBad about the game. Too short but you can continue playing after you have "won".\n\nI think there's replay value in this if you want a relaxing management game. It's definitely worth $3.\n","October 31, 2015","true","18.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Do I enjoy this game? Yes. It's not perfect and could use some tweaks but I never once found myself raging or annoyed during my play to this point.\n\nThe game itself is fairly easy to get a hang of and it doesn't take long to learn basic strategies. Once you learn them it won't be long before you're pumping out top quality game after top quality game. Sending your studio to the very top. The gameplay itself is also simple and easy enough to understand (outside of a couple things). It also looks nice enough for what it is in terms of the graphics its gone for. Clearly taking some inspiration for other games such as Prison Architect.\n\nThere really isn't too much "negative" with the game. More just tweaks I'd enjoy seeing. Such as having the date show at all times and not only when you however over the clock. It'd also be neat to have the ability to develop for certain platforms (i.e - PC, console, handheld, etc) to expand what development is like. Also more things to decorate your office with. Paintings, other snack machines, other forms of entertainment...maybe even the ability to add different floors.\n\nAll in all I do highly suggest checking out this game, it hs a very small pricetag and you'll get your monies worth from it if you enjoy this type of game.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Kqw2yQUmoUY","January 10","true","11.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The mechanics are relatively simple: keep your devs working to maintain their skills, level them up to allow them to produce better quality games, make games to meet current genre demands and win awards.\n\nIn many ways the game feels somewhat like Game Dev Story Lite... you cannot develop your own platform, your characters never really get unhappy, sick or disappear, nor do they get chronically tired without a holiday. A few more management mechanics would have helped the game's long term play because there reaches a point where all you have to do is keep churning out games and you just can't go wrong.

I bought it with money from steam trading cards, so that is a plus.\n\nIt lacks any real balance, the game is incredibly easy without any real pressure to excel.  Micromanaging your teams, placement of watercoolers and desks, idling employees, etc.  Can be entirely ignored, any game you make will replace the money it took to make it even if three quarters of the team were idling for most the production.  To finish the last objective I pretty much pumped out a ton of tiny trash games, and one AAA game.\n\nI would love to see an extended version of this game, with more difficulty, more space and easier controls.  I also didn't understand why games needed an exact number of people working on them.\n\nThe game has mechanics just to have them, hiring people may as well be random instead of a pop up menu.  Assigning workstations may as well be random.  It borrows a lot from LionHead's Movies game, the award ceremony seemed like a weird copy that didn't make a lot of sense.\n\nThe game overall was fun, and it was a great deal.","April 19","true","2.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

However, I am certainly a fan of games and game development, and this game looked too intriguing to pass up.\n\nI found this game to be very fun. The aesthetic is adorable (most appropriate word I could come up with), and the interface makes it pretty easy to get an idea of what is going on with your developers and your projects. I like that they have "zzz's" over their heads when they're not currently assigned to a project or working on anything (though they can also appear this way during normal sleep). When creating a new project, the game highlights the areas in which your developers have skill (you train them), so you can make sure to optimize their productivity. The game's goals keep you constantly working to improve your studio.\n\nThe fake game reviews are pretty funny (especially the reviewers' names), but you'll find yourself seeing the same comments fairly consistently if you make games within the same genre. Since the game is early access, I would be they're planning to expand this area.\n\nSpeaking of early access, I am about two hours into playing it and can say that the game is extremely polished. It's one of the better early access titles I've played, and I honestly forgot it was early access until I came to write this review.\n\nIf I had to be nitpicky, I will say that it gets a bit repetitive at times. Though that can be said of basically any management sims. Perhaps some "disasters" could make their way into the game to add some challenge (busted water coolers, other companies stealing your workers, fire, etc.). Also, maybe having to manage some infrastructure would be a fun addition to the game.\n\nOverall, I definitely recommend this game. It's already in a great state, and I'm sure it will only get better with early access improvements!","September 12, 2015","true","3.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

DX has amazing gameplay mechanics if you're into one of those "upgrade" games. If you love ADventure Capitalist you'll want to marry this game and make little flash games with it. The only thing I found lacking in this area was the fact that after about 8 hours of gameplay It gets a little boaring after about 10 hours of gameplay unlike ADV Capitalist. I keep comparing it to ADventure Capitalist but I should tell you this: It is far superior because you haveto use your mind, improve your workers, give them new traits, organize your office, polish and advertise your games according to the rating unlike a simple "cookie-clicker" copy.\nGameplay Mechanics Rating: 95%\n\nVisualsI'm judging this as a casual indie game, not as a multi-million dollar game, in that regard the graphics are very good, relaxing, great anti-aliasing ensures no jagged edges. It only used up about 256 Mb of video RAM so even the worst PC's can run it at it's top.\nVisuals Rating: 80%\n\nAudioThe background music doesn't get in your way as long as it's not too loud, note that the default volume is a little high, but that's my own personal preference. The audio could easily be improved if the dev added a few extra tracks. Overall the music was good, not amazing.\nAudio Rating: 70%\n\nOtherThe achievments were fun and interesting, my only complaint being that I got 90% of them 4 hours into the game, but as a 3 USD game I have no problem with that, however if you're the sort of guy who aims for achievments you might want to think it over, however this is not usually a deciding factor. It doesn't have controller support and doesn't need it.\n\n\nOverall Rating: 82%\nTL;DR/pros & cons\n\n+ Fun and a great way to pass a few hours\n+ Relaxing visuals\n+ Addictive\n+ Not RAM intensive\n+ Great tutorial (I was actually very impressed by it)\n\n- A single game would last a maximum of 8 hours\n\nEnd result, if you have a few dollars at hand and want a great casual game.

It feels like it's trying to be a clone of Game Dev Tycoon but it's not doing very well at that. It's also plagued with semi frequent crashes. Then theres the fact everything is locked away, the game teases you by showing you all this neat stuff, but then it goes "Nuh-uh, you gotta be more important to have this." Which is a huge jerk move.  In addiiton it seems to be the case that it doesn't know what it wants to do with itself, it has a lack of direction guiding it which makes it excedingly difficult, at the start of the game it's impossible to make money because you're constantly trying to throw money at problems to fix them and get nothing back for results. The tutorial is just plain bad, and everything is crudely implimented, you need a table to plan things, and I struggled for like 20 minutes to figure out you need to put tables next to each other to make a four seater table. Overall this game has potentially but as it is I can't recomend it, it needs some serious work put into the difficulty scaling and how things work overall.","September 17, 2015","false","0.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

With a limited starting budget, you have to choose who to hire, which of the 4 skills to train them in and which types of games you at to release. Your office can be upgraded with new equipment and a couple of adornments.\n\nChoices all-around are fairly limited, which prevents you getting bogged down with choices during the relatively short playtime. Extra tasks are always available to net you some bonus money to put towards your games development and marketing costs. You'll get a few opportunities to expand the size of your studio and teach your employees new skills, which will enable them to make better quality games. The in-game time can be sped up and paused which is a handy feature.\n\nPresentation is simple and cute. The game doesn't take itself too seriously either: critic's names are parodies of their real life counterparts, some of the employees are dressed like they are ready to sell you a sack of wheat rather than code a game, and your first reviews will be comically punishing. You might be surprised just who shows up at your door asking for work by the way!\n\nSome nice touches I enjoyed were seeing some employees avoid the door into the office and walk through the hole I left in the wall instead and receiving extremely mixed reviews (another parody of the real World?). If you enjoy management sims and like the idea of a tongue-in-cheek games development theme, you should definitely get your money's worth of fun from the slim asking price.\n\nGiveaway here (ending approx.

It's also less than half the price of Game Dev Tycoon, so I guess this could be your fix if you can't fork over the $10 for that game.\nThe graphics are positively hideous, as the characters look as though they were hastily designed in MS Paint or Photoshop.  The gameplay is functional, but is more complicated than Game Dev Tycoon which gave you simple mechanics that worked seemlessly to offer an experience more addictive than heroin.  Game Corp doesn't have that quality.  The tutorial is a complex induction course that, disappointingly, doesn't even offer much interactivity in the development of games like Game Dev Tycoon did.\nPersonally I wasn't able to make the game full screen as it crashed when I tried.  This meant I had to make due with the low resolution window making it near impossible to see the itty bitty graphics and text going on in the game.\nAnother problem was the music, in that it clashed cataclysmically with the tone of the game and was by default way too loud.  If you're wondering what music would fit for this type of experience, I'd point again to Game Dev Tycoon, which was backed with pleasant, relaxing, ambient elevator-like music that set the mood very well.  This game seems to switch rapidly between types of music that sound very over-produced for music that's just supposed to be a background soundtrack.\nFor $3 I suppose it's okay.  It's certainly functional, but it pales in comparison to Game Dev Tycoon, which is actually being very generous.\n\nTL;DR: Alright for the price I guess but get Game Dev Tycoon instead.","March 29","false","0.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It was a bit too easy to make money and "progress" through it, but as I said fun nonetheless. Given that it is in early access and is only 3 dollars it's hard to beat it on price vs. enjoyability. Once they add more features and flesh it out more I'll be excited to try it out. Until then there are still better alternatives in GameBiz and Software Inc., if you want to scratch that game development itch. It is however better than the more popular Mad Games Tycoon and Game Dev Tycoon.","October 29, 2015","true","4.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

However currently it lacks features and game customisation options such as to set competitor and game difficulty options are currently non existant. As is the ability to skip the tutorial. The UI needs a lot of work. Lack of an auto pause feature is noticable and fustrating. I would say that what the game lacks most right now isn't content it's well realized content. A lot of the ways things function right now don't really make a lot of sense and don't give the player much interaction other than doing the one set "right" thing to do.\n\nFor a sandbox like experience it feels like you are on rails a lot f you want to compete with the opponents properly. Which is the real downer for me. I want to like this game. I hope it matures during early access to bring out that potential. And I hope the devs wont listen to the constant clamour for "new features" and make sure they get the features they do implement right. Because despite all my criticisms this game has a good hook. It just needs a hell of a lot more polish.","September 21, 2015","false","3.6"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","1"

Game Dev Tycoon's system is more complex, with a focus on making sure you match the right genre and platform and feel of the game, creating a sort of matrix of what works and what doesn't. Game Corp DX instead asks you to focus on worker management and ensure the right people for the job are working on the right teams.\n\nThe game feels a bit clunky in spots -- not being able to rotate items when building is a huge oversight. And there's not as much going on concurrently as there is in Game Dev Tycoon. This is still a solid way to spend a couple of hours. I blew through the campaign in about 2.5 hours, though I'd imagine it's possible to do it much quicker if you're not a perfectionist.\n\nIn short: definitely a fun game, but lacks complexity and is over too soon","October 24, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shadow_squall/recommended/399670/","shadow_squall","Taric the Gemknight","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shadow_squall/","408 products in account","I'm writing this review based on Normal mode in story, as I have yet to play the challenge mode (looking forward to it) or story hard mode. Though I have played a large number of these games, so I'm comparing to what I've experienced but don't take my word as fact as I am human and I am biased in some aspects.\n\nTL;DR at the bottom, because I'm long winded.\n\n\nThe game itself is a simple game creation simulator where you hire people then specialise them into either Code, Art, Sound or Writing and get them to make games for you. The workers gain experience and get better at their jobs, to a point, and eventually this allows you to move into bigger studios and make bigger games. Until you complete everything there is to do and then you pretty much unlock free mode.\n\nMy first opinion of the game was that it was simple, this is by no means a negative, a bit of a half and half at times though. It gives the game it's own place within a genre of games that is full of innovative ideas and different ways of doing things. I would, from what I've experienced, call this game an intro into Management Simulation games. I say this because It's not a hard game to learn or master (In my opinion) and I found myself breezing through the game in 3 hours without even a hitch in the money department. But people that are newer to this genre would find this game to have a very plesent learning curve.\n\nIt doesn't have the thing a lot of other similar games have where genres are locked off until you research them or a job tree for workers to evolve within. Which was nice to me, I usually find those sorts of activities tend to bore me as they can take a long time to do or reduce the quality of your games until things get back on track. In Game Corp DX you'll have all the Genres unlocked for you instantly (I don't know why some games have you research them for months in the first place) and your workers will take the specialistation you give them and stick with it (unless you want to change them later).\n\nThe music isn't bad, though it's repetiveness could get annoying to some though but I found it plesent. No sound errors or noises that were unecessarily loud too which is a plus.\n\nOnly things i found that could be looked at in a very slightly negative way is the difficulity level, though I said above I played only on Normal and have yet to look at the challenge and hard modes to get a comparison. The achievements also weren't very hard to get but as I played on normal, that had a hand in it.\n\nFor cons I found the bar at the top to be too small, I could read it, but at times it was difficult. The rooms are very small with not much room to do things, half the time you'll spend playing will be organising the furniture to fit everything in. Not a big variety in the objects to put in, decorations especially.\n\n----Bug/Glitch----\nOnly Bug I found was a progress bug, and though annoying it's exploitable from what I could see. I finished all the storyline quests, closed the game and re-opened it to see if it saved it, it did but it reset all the story quests and their rewards. I'm not sure if this always happens or if it was just because I finished everything in one sitting but it happened.\n-------------------\n\nOverall, I'm glad to have played Game Corp DX, it is a good game for the price that's being asked and it's simple enough to just sit down and go for people who are experienced right down to people who are brand new to the genre.\n\n\n------TL;DR------\n\nPros+\n- Easy to pick up and play\n- Simple for beginners\n- Not a bad price tag for what it delivers\n\nPros with a little Con, or Cons with a little Pro\n- Music was nice, though some people won't like the repetivness of it\n- Art was simple but some people have a problem with simple art\n- Progress bug but it's exploitable for the benefit of the player (money)\n- Not very long if you know what you're doing\n\nCons\n- Can be boring for those who ae used to all the things other, bigger games do\n- Small top HUD bar\n- Small rooms/Hard to fit everything at times\n- Not many decoration options\n\nOverview\n- Updates will improve this immensly\n- If you're on the fence about buying it, it's not much and it's a fun game to play, so buy it :P","October 4, 2015","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not easy when you begin, but if you follow up the challenges (objectives) the game offers, you end up having good conditions to take over the market (ingame) and be the very best game studio.\n\nOne of the best features is the control you have over the qualities of the employees. They may not be the best when you hire them, but while you advance throughout the game, you are able to nullifie those disadvantages, and even turn them into advantages!\n\nThe game lets you choose how you want to progress and how fast, and offers an high variety of customizable content.\n\nIf i had to point out anything, it would be the late game status, meaning, once you get to the last part of the game, there's prety much nothing to do (when you are the very best). Of course every game has an end but, it feels like you get there very fast. At least from my experience. Considering the game is recent, i suppose that is something that might yet be worked out.\n\nOn a final note, i'm proud that we finally get to see some good games from portuguese companies.

The only improvements I'd really like to see is more variety on characters, objects and events. Also, possibly a better user interface, though I never really felt lost. I would also appreciate a slower pace at times so I can view my graphs and decide on things without having to pause all the time. I'm not usually a fan of strategy games, but it took almost no effort to understand the system and master it here, so the game is really well put together in that regard!

I got it with the 10% discount at 1.79GBP. Absolutely worth it!\n\nIt still has here and there some bugs, but they don't interfere with the game flow. Neither are they annoying. Overall, it took me 2.5 hours from start to finish. It was fun. Though, it is a bit sad you cannot train a worker for all 4 areas, but only 1. Which makes the game pretty straightforward. The idea about moving to the next city is fun, the office architecture doesn't really change though. You can expand the office, which is a great. But i think it could be improved. WE NEED A BIGGER WORKFORCE :) 50 cheap workers are not enough. But for that it would also make sense to introduce harder scoring and more awards / achievements to unlock. I liked the sense of humor. 9001!\n\nThe only annoying thing was the moving of stuff, moving objects could be improved. Also the handy feature of turning an object is missing.\n\nLastly, somehow I couldnt change it to a higher one from 1024*768 - which you might understand is annoying on a 2560*1600 monitor.\n\nSo finally: Go for it","October 2, 2015","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With 10 People at the table it's almost certain someone will be away due to drinking or eating, even with their bad traits removed, this means the pre production of a game can take half a year or more which can cause issues when using all of your employees for one game.\n\nIt isn't as good as some other game tycoon type games i've played but if more is added and the small issues are sorted it could be.

It's not easy when you begin, but if you follow up the challenges (objectives) the game offers, you end up having good conditions to take over the market (ingame) and be the very best game studio.\n\nOne of the best features is the control you have over the qualities of the employees. They may not be the best when you hire them, but while you advance throughout the game, you are able to nullifie those disadvantages, and even turn them into advantages!\n\nThe game lets you choose how you want to progress and how fast, and offers an high variety of customizable content.\n\nIf i had to point out anything, it would be the late game status, meaning, once you get to the last part of the game, there's prety much nothing to do (when you are the very best). Of course every game has an end but, it feels like you get there very fast. At least from my experience. Considering the game is recent, i suppose that is something that might yet be worked out.\n\nOn a final note, i'm proud that we finally get to see some good games from portuguese companies.

(Example: Cannot set prices for your games!)\n\nSummary:\n\n"Game Corp DX" is a fairly well made tycoon/simulation game. There were no major issues that I could see with the game. The game is well worth the price, but I could not see myself paying more than $3 USD for it. Only suggestions I can give to the developers is to try and improve customization options when it comes to creating a new game (One idea could be possibly adding options to choose the amount of players that can play together. Example: Singleplayer, Local Multiplayer, Multiplayer..etc). Overall, even though I feel that there is some more minor work to be done on "Game Corp DX", it is absolutely worth a try.\n\nFinal Rating:\n\n8.75/10","October 3, 2015","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Get it if you like simple web games to pass the time.\n\nFor what used to be a simple flash game, this port to the Steam version is a very fun experience and well worth the $2.50 I paid for it. If you've played a game like Game Dev Tycoon before, this game is like the fun-size version. Not very deep and not nearly as much time investment required (as you can tell with my 4hrs on the game), but still a fun little time-waster.\n\nLinux compatibility is also a plus, since this is a type of game that I would run off of my Chromebook.\n\nOnce you get the hang of the game, it's easy to exploit the same tactics and get 5-star rated games all the time, as opposed to Game Dev Tycoon which took slightly more finesse (although it's the same strategy, really). Although once I branched into the final city of the game (San Franciso), it was neat to try out different arrangements to give my team maximum efficiency with two different buildings.\n\nOverall, decent little game.","October 3, 2015","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I managed to play it for a solid hour on my first go and wouldn't mind playing again. It definitely has its own charm, and that really shows. The only improvements I'd really like to see is more variety on characters, objects and events. Also, possibly a better user interface, though I never really felt lost. I would also appreciate a slower pace at times so I can view my graphs and decide on things without having to pause all the time. I'm not usually a fan of strategy games, but it took almost no effort to understand the system and master it here, so the game is really well put together in that regard! It's definitely worth checking out for $3, because it feels like a pretty cool experience even as it is.","September 26, 2015","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I got it with the 10% discount at 1.79GBP. Absolutely worth it!\n\nIt still has here and there some bugs, but they don't interfere with the game flow. Neither are they annoying. Overall, it took me 2.5 hours from start to finish. It was fun. Though, it is a bit sad you cannot train a worker for all 4 areas, but only 1. Which makes the game pretty straightforward. The idea about moving to the next city is fun, the office architecture doesn't really change though. You can expand the office, which is a great. But i think it could be improved. WE NEED A BIGGER WORKFORCE :) 50 cheap workers are not enough. But for that it would also make sense to introduce harder scoring and more awards / achievements to unlock. I liked the sense of humor. 9001!\n\nThe only annoying thing was the moving of stuff, moving objects could be improved. Also the handy feature of turning an object is missing.\n\nLastly, somehow I couldnt change it to a higher one from 1024*768 - which you might understand is annoying on a 2560*1600 monitor.\n\nSo finally: Go for it","October 2, 2015","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Ironically, there goes 6 hours I could have been doing developing a game. In short, it's a great game but it lacks the conflicts of development as seen in serious shows like Codemonkeys.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZtL_KVzaao\n\n\nThis game reflects a “current trend” or a “historical prospective” of indie devs becoming AAA, and a happy story at that. In 6 hours or I think 7 years, I won every award, had more than $900,000,000, and went from making crappy games to games of various scales and deadlines. The real life strategies of looking at markets, hiring and training new talent, and scheduled a variety of games to pay monthly expenses helped me consider a real life business plan.\n\nHowever, I had no shareholders to deal with, no taxes or laws to cope with. "Zynga" being an example, it would be interesting to have to deal with outside pressure to make the company public, this causing tension between myself and the people I've employed who do not want me to sell out. The people themselves, should like to work with others and not like others for different reasons. It would have been nice to deal with "sexism" and "race" where play testers would give me tough moral dilemmas such as "bigger boobs" and "can we have less black and gay people in the game". The cause and effect would be, if I go with AAA standards, I would make more money, but would get more flack for certain groups. Also, what about distribution, is it online, or will have to deal with stores like Target or Walmart? Rating systems could also be in place and getting banned from countries which could effect press and sales over all like Rockstar?\n\nImagine, EA is going to try and buy you out and you have to stop them from being a boss-- get it, a "boss battle".\n\nGameplay Notes to Dev--\n\nPlease add a back "button" in menus, and sadly the loss of skills due to specialization doesn't seem to make sense.\n\nAlso, it would be nice to have some conflicts as mentioned before (*Cough, expansion pack).","October 3, 2015","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Hire developers, create games (by size and genre) to improve their skillset and try and pummel your rivals into submission with a relentless torrent of games you can name yourself, from Granny Turismo to Resident Weevil. Build your office/feng shui your way to success, send your employees into the Enhancement station to make them better humans and train them up to be master coders, writers, artists and sound designers. The better you are, the more awards you win in the bizarre end-of-year awards, where companies are judged on how many games they've released and how big the team is.\n\nThe first time I played this game I'd lost about seven hours in the blink of an eye and it was 3am, which is a good indication of how this game draws you in. Simple to pick up and learn, and not that hard to master either, it can get a little samey but is kept alive by a Challenge Mode and the game setting you other goals to hit in the normal mode itself.\n\nIf you enjoy strategy games, you can't go wrong for the price.","October 17, 2015","true","28.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's simple and light hearted with limits on what you can do. There isn't much to it yet, but I'm sure with time it will get more added since it is in EA.  As far as mechanics and gameplay go, I'd say it's satisfying enough for what it's intended. I enjoyed hearing the speech like that in Animal Crossing, props to that lol. The limits are the only cons I can find in this game.\n\nI created a game in it, hit #1 and lost it a month later due to another company making a game 15 times better. It's a tad unfair in that regard since you can't get top end staff at first, but it gives you something to work towards and think about what you design and release since that effects how much income your studio has each month. Overall, it had a simple feel to it and I certainly enjoyed it! I recommend it and score it 7.5/10 simply because of the limits. (There are far more genres than just those in the game and different programs needed to design than just 3 of each type)","September 24, 2015","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Get it if you like simple web games to pass the time.\n\nFor what used to be a simple flash game, this port to the Steam version is a very fun experience and well worth the $2.50 I paid for it. If you've played a game like Game Dev Tycoon before, this game is like the fun-size version. Not very deep and not nearly as much time investment required (as you can tell with my 4hrs on the game), but still a fun little time-waster.\n\nLinux compatibility is also a plus, since this is a type of game that I would run off of my Chromebook.\n\nOnce you get the hang of the game, it's easy to exploit the same tactics and get 5-star rated games all the time, as opposed to Game Dev Tycoon which took slightly more finesse (although it's the same strategy, really). Although once I branched into the final city of the game (San Franciso), it was neat to try out different arrangements to give my team maximum efficiency with two different buildings.\n\nOverall, decent little game.","October 3, 2015","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Ironically, there goes 6 hours I could have been doing developing a game. In short, it's a great game but it lacks the conflicts of development as seen in serious shows like Codemonkeys.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZtL_KVzaao\n\n\nThis game reflects a “current trend” or a “historical prospective” of indie devs becoming AAA, and a happy story at that. In 6 hours or I think 7 years, I won every award, had more than $900,000,000, and went from making crappy games to games of various scales and deadlines. The real life strategies of looking at markets, hiring and training new talent, and scheduled a variety of games to pay monthly expenses helped me consider a real life business plan.\n\nHowever, I had no shareholders to deal with, no taxes or laws to cope with. "Zynga" being an example, it would be interesting to have to deal with outside pressure to make the company public, this causing tension between myself and the people I've employed who do not want me to sell out. The people themselves, should like to work with others and not like others for different reasons. It would have been nice to deal with "sexism" and "race" where play testers would give me tough moral dilemmas such as "bigger boobs" and "can we have less black and gay people in the game". The cause and effect would be, if I go with AAA standards, I would make more money, but would get more flack for certain groups. Also, what about distribution, is it online, or will have to deal with stores like Target or Walmart? Rating systems could also be in place and getting banned from countries which could effect press and sales over all like Rockstar?\n\nImagine, EA is going to try and buy you out and you have to stop them from being a boss-- get it, a "boss battle".\n\nGameplay Notes to Dev--\n\nPlease add a back "button" in menus, and sadly the loss of skills due to specialization doesn't seem to make sense.\n\nAlso, it would be nice to have some conflicts as mentioned before (*Cough, expansion pack).","October 3, 2015","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Hire developers, create games (by size and genre) to improve their skillset and try and pummel your rivals into submission with a relentless torrent of games you can name yourself, from Granny Turismo to Resident Weevil. Build your office/feng shui your way to success, send your employees into the Enhancement station to make them better humans and train them up to be master coders, writers, artists and sound designers. The better you are, the more awards you win in the bizarre end-of-year awards, where companies are judged on how many games they've released and how big the team is.\n\nThe first time I played this game I'd lost about seven hours in the blink of an eye and it was 3am, which is a good indication of how this game draws you in. Simple to pick up and learn, and not that hard to master either, it can get a little samey but is kept alive by a Challenge Mode and the game setting you other goals to hit in the normal mode itself.\n\nIf you enjoy strategy games, you can't go wrong for the price.","October 17, 2015","true","28.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was looking to end the end, mainly because there was an objective indicatore, telling how many objectives there were left!\n\nAll in all, I like to see cash flow in and to manage people, hell yea.\n\nFoot note, you can't go wrong with the game  : it works well, it is easy and entertaining, it is okay for the price.\n\nMaybe the improvements that are announced by the developper of the game may bring me back, but I am sure it would at best make me do a new game which will only cost me 1h30 to 2h of my life.\n\nAnyways, can't say much wrong of it, just keep in mind, it is quite easy and basic.","September 28, 2015","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay is pretty good, well thought through and easy to understand. The tutorial is a great help for getting into the game. But the best thing about the tutorial: it's skippable, in case you already know what to do. Many games forget that nowadays and it's just a pain in the you-know-where.\n\nThe reviews that you get from the critics seem rather random, so do the sales of your games, but it could be that I simply didn't properly understand the algorithm that's working in the background.\n\nProps for the intro, nice play with the name Endless Loop. I really liked that one.\n\nOne thing I noticed when recording a Let's Test video: When using Fraps as recording software and you go to the options menu and hit "Apply" to leave it again, the game seems to try to set the resolution again, even if I didn't change it. Then I got an error message, telling me that the resolution could not be loaded, causing the game to crash. I'm not sure if that happens with other recording software as well, since I simply didn't open the option menu on my next attempt to record it.","September 28, 2015","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shadow_squall/recommended/399670/","shadow_squall","Taric the Gemknight","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shadow_squall/","408 products in account","I'm writing this review based on Normal mode in story, as I have yet to play the challenge mode (looking forward to it) or story hard mode. Though I have played a large number of these games, so I'm comparing to what I've experienced but don't take my word as fact as I am human and I am biased in some aspects.\n\nTL;DR at the bottom, because I'm long winded.\n\n\nThe game itself is a simple game creation simulator where you hire people then specialise them into either Code, Art, Sound or Writing and get them to make games for you. The workers gain experience and get better at their jobs, to a point, and eventually this allows you to move into bigger studios and make bigger games. Until you complete everything there is to do and then you pretty much unlock free mode.\n\nMy first opinion of the game was that it was simple, this is by no means a negative, a bit of a half and half at times though. It gives the game it's own place within a genre of games that is full of innovative ideas and different ways of doing things. I would, from what I've experienced, call this game an intro into Management Simulation games. I say this because It's not a hard game to learn or master (In my opinion) and I found myself breezing through the game in 3 hours without even a hitch in the money department. But people that are newer to this genre would find this game to have a very plesent learning curve.\n\nIt doesn't have the thing a lot of other similar games have where genres are locked off until you research them or a job tree for workers to evolve within. Which was nice to me, I usually find those sorts of activities tend to bore me as they can take a long time to do or reduce the quality of your games until things get back on track. In Game Corp DX you'll have all the Genres unlocked for you instantly (I don't know why some games have you research them for months in the first place) and your workers will take the specialistation you give them and stick with it (unless you want to change them later).\n\nThe music isn't bad, though it's repetiveness could get annoying to some though but I found it plesent. No sound errors or noises that were unecessarily loud too which is a plus.\n\nOnly things i found that could be looked at in a very slightly negative way is the difficulity level, though I said above I played only on Normal and have yet to look at the challenge and hard modes to get a comparison. The achievements also weren't very hard to get but as I played on normal, that had a hand in it.\n\nFor cons I found the bar at the top to be too small, I could read it, but at times it was difficult. The rooms are very small with not much room to do things, half the time you'll spend playing will be organising the furniture to fit everything in. Not a big variety in the objects to put in, decorations especially.\n\n----Bug/Glitch----\nOnly Bug I found was a progress bug, and though annoying it's exploitable from what I could see. I finished all the storyline quests, closed the game and re-opened it to see if it saved it, it did but it reset all the story quests and their rewards. I'm not sure if this always happens or if it was just because I finished everything in one sitting but it happened.\n-------------------\n\nOverall, I'm glad to have played Game Corp DX, it is a good game for the price that's being asked and it's simple enough to just sit down and go for people who are experienced right down to people who are brand new to the genre.\n\n\n------TL;DR------\n\nPros+\n- Easy to pick up and play\n- Simple for beginners\n- Not a bad price tag for what it delivers\n\nPros with a little Con, or Cons with a little Pro\n- Music was nice, though some people won't like the repetivness of it\n- Art was simple but some people have a problem with simple art\n- Progress bug but it's exploitable for the benefit of the player (money)\n- Not very long if you know what you're doing\n\nCons\n- Can be boring for those who ae used to all the things other, bigger games do\n- Small top HUD bar\n- Small rooms/Hard to fit everything at times\n- Not many decoration options\n\nOverview\n- Updates will improve this immensly\n- If you're on the fence about buying it, it's not much and it's a fun game to play, so buy it :P","October 4, 2015","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not easy when you begin, but if you follow up the challenges (objectives) the game offers, you end up having good conditions to take over the market (ingame) and be the very best game studio.\n\nOne of the best features is the control you have over the qualities of the employees. They may not be the best when you hire them, but while you advance throughout the game, you are able to nullifie those disadvantages, and even turn them into advantages!\n\nThe game lets you choose how you want to progress and how fast, and offers an high variety of customizable content.\n\nIf i had to point out anything, it would be the late game status, meaning, once you get to the last part of the game, there's prety much nothing to do (when you are the very best). Of course every game has an end but, it feels like you get there very fast. At least from my experience. Considering the game is recent, i suppose that is something that might yet be worked out.\n\nOn a final note, i'm proud that we finally get to see some good games from portuguese companies.

You create your own company, produce video games of your choice and compete against different companies. The goal of this game is to become the company who makes the most money and the biggest studio. I like simulation games, beginning with my interest in Cities: Skyines. This is great but...it feels broken. It's hard to understand the real purpose of the game when the first 20 games you make get terrible reviews, no matter what you do. I love the game mechanics and how you're able to choose the genre and name of your game and how you compete against different companies. It's just frustating though, as training your guys endlessly doesn't seem to do ANYTHING and inevitably you end up going bankrupt. If they ever end up making a better tutorial and make the game feel more rewarding, I'll come back and give it a thumbs up but for now, this game doesn't deserve it.","January 30","false","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

The visuals look a lot smoother and the SFX had some minor improvements. There are few minor glitches that doesn't really detract from the experience. The gameplay itself remained relatively the same as the Newgrounds version along with improved camera controls. The game itself can get rather repetitive after a while, so keep that in mind. As of right now the game is pretty simple and easy to learn, which is good for casual players not too familiar with sim games. The more experienced players who loves in-depth micro-management will probably be disappointed.If you have a few bucks lying around and looking for something simple, then this is a nice game to pick-up.\n\nAs an early access game, this is a good start, but I would love to see the developers take the game even further, so\nhere's a short list of improvements that I hope to see in the final release:\n\n*Variety in the games you make (ex. Making games genre hybrids)\n*Improved employee AI (ex. The AI getting a drink and eating when they take a break)\n*Different levels of quality for buildings (ex. Affecting how efficiently employees work)\n*Being able to improve employee's skills (ex. Give them training tasks to hone their skills)\n*More variety in sound and music (ex.

Ironically, there goes 6 hours I could have been doing developing a game. In short, it's a great game but it lacks the conflicts of development as seen in serious shows like Codemonkeys.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZtL_KVzaao\n\n\nThis game reflects a “current trend” or a “historical prospective” of indie devs becoming AAA, and a happy story at that. In 6 hours or I think 7 years, I won every award, had more than $900,000,000, and went from making crappy games to games of various scales and deadlines. The real life strategies of looking at markets, hiring and training new talent, and scheduled a variety of games to pay monthly expenses helped me consider a real life business plan.\n\nHowever, I had no shareholders to deal with, no taxes or laws to cope with. "Zynga" being an example, it would be interesting to have to deal with outside pressure to make the company public, this causing tension between myself and the people I've employed who do not want me to sell out. The people themselves, should like to work with others and not like others for different reasons. It would have been nice to deal with "sexism" and "race" where play testers would give me tough moral dilemmas such as "bigger boobs" and "can we have less black and gay people in the game". The cause and effect would be, if I go with AAA standards, I would make more money, but would get more flack for certain groups. Also, what about distribution, is it online, or will have to deal with stores like Target or Walmart? Rating systems could also be in place and getting banned from countries which could effect press and sales over all like Rockstar?\n\nImagine, EA is going to try and buy you out and you have to stop them from being a boss-- get it, a "boss battle".\n\nGameplay Notes to Dev--\n\nPlease add a back "button" in menus, and sadly the loss of skills due to specialization doesn't seem to make sense.\n\nAlso, it would be nice to have some conflicts as mentioned before (*Cough, expansion pack).","October 3, 2015","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game has a lot of charm, but the workers need more specialization, we need to be able to make bigger productions and have more control over the QA part. Fine control is key here. I'd give this game a 4 out of 6. The developer should create more content, or allow the community to do so, skins for workers and logo is far from enough. We need espionage, stock market, sound studios in other cities, localization branches, larger corporate parks. The fear of workers leaving us for better companies, salary control, ability to rotate office furniture, Project managers who can be instructed to make decisions like QA Polish, better building tools (dragging walls).

Even the full $3. Honestly the game was pretty entertaining, but it lacks replayability. I played it once for like 5 hours straight right after I got it, tried on and off to get the very last achievement (The achievements are super easy, you will get 95% of them from just playing the game normally and the last 5% are just special names you need to give games).\n\nThe game rating system is rather... Well, unfortunate. In fact its the only thing that really let me down about the game. It relies almost 100% on how much money you put into the game. So what you will find at first is that you are coming up with noting but misses, and late game you can literally get nothing but 5 star ratings with little to no effort. Literally, literally no effort at all. Chose a topic and name, chose the people to work on it, and chose the programs you want to use to work on it. I had 2 seperate teams in game working on 2 projects at a time over, and over, and over again and it was nothing but 5 star ratings across the board. Ultamatly that was what stopped me from playing the game. Once you reach the final office it becomes far too repetive.\n\nOther then that, its just small little things that will bug you... Like how during the planning phase planning cannot continue unless everyone developing the game is at the table at once, WHICH WOULD BE FINE, but early game most of your workers will have the 'hungry quickly' or 'thirsty quickly' effect, which means simply getting started on the game may take 2 or 3 ingame monthes.\n\nIm guessing things like that will be worked out at some point... Overall, the time I spent on the game I found fun enough. So would I suggest it? Yes.

Game Dev Tycoon's system is more complex, with a focus on making sure you match the right genre and platform and feel of the game, creating a sort of matrix of what works and what doesn't. Game Corp DX instead asks you to focus on worker management and ensure the right people for the job are working on the right teams.\n\nThe game feels a bit clunky in spots -- not being able to rotate items when building is a huge oversight. And there's not as much going on concurrently as there is in Game Dev Tycoon. This is still a solid way to spend a couple of hours. I blew through the campaign in about 2.5 hours, though I'd imagine it's possible to do it much quicker if you're not a perfectionist.\n\nIn short: definitely a fun game, but lacks complexity and is over too soon","October 24, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Keep up the good work. I have enjoyed 60+ hours so far, have enjoyed the recent update, and can't wait to see the final product.\n\nLong Version\nI like the game mechanics. Office layout efficiency, developer improvement, game development, earn money, win fans, change cities. I think these have all been blended well.\n\nI've only come across two potentially serious issues and a few UI bugs. Very solid for an alpha early release!\n\nPotentially Serious Issues\nThe first serious issue is when I have it open for several hours (common occurance :). By the time I get to SF and have a huge staff things start to slow down. I'm not sure if this is because I'm constantly switching between pausing and speed 3  or not. It shouldn't be my machine, as it is a solid gaming machine and this game shouldn't be taking up resources. I can repro this by just playing for a couple of hours.\n\nThe second issue was that I have had all or most of my staff disappear in two separate games. It happened late game (SF) both times. I haven't been able to purposely reproduce this, but it's happened twice.\n\nUI Bugs\nFan numbers display (unsigned int error?) - Start a new game, quit tutorial, open Project Manager (E) screen, click New Project, look at fan numbers (should be normal). Speed 3, wait until next month dialog, Continue, then open Project Manager again, click New Project, look at fan numbers. This time they're things like -2147483588. No big deal, as you develop games, each game fan number will reset and, once you've developed one of each game, it's never a problem again.\n\nGraph goes off dialog - I ran into this when I had a series of terrible developer options at the start of a game. Start a new game, do not make games, only spend money for a few months (build things, hire developers, etc.). After a two or three months, when you have negative cash, Open Studio Info (G) dialog, click Graph. Some of the graph lines and points go down below the graph area, even outside the dialog.\n\nWishlist\n- I would love to be able to open the New Project dialog directly, instead of always having to open Project Manager and clicking on the New Project tab. It's one of the most common things I do, so it'd be nice to have it in Options.\n- I would love to have another major dialog for employee managment. Currently, if I want to look at my employees, their abilities and experience, I have to start a new project, select a game, and continue.\n- Remove Project Summary Dialog. I actually NEVER use the Project Summary Dialog, as all the info I need is available in the default tab of the Project Manager dialog.\n\nI have more feedback if you'd like, too :)\n\nThanks so much for this game! I have really enjoyed it, have loved the (one) updates that have happened since I've gotten it, and look forward to watching it grow to completion!\n","September 26, 2015","true","95.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I managed to play it for a solid hour on my first go and wouldn't mind playing again. It definitely has its own charm, and that really shows. The only improvements I'd really like to see is more variety on characters, objects and events. Also, possibly a better user interface, though I never really felt lost. I would also appreciate a slower pace at times so I can view my graphs and decide on things without having to pause all the time. I'm not usually a fan of strategy games, but it took almost no effort to understand the system and master it here, so the game is really well put together in that regard!

The visuals look a lot smoother and the SFX had some minor improvements. There are few minor glitches that doesn't really detract from the experience. The gameplay itself remained relatively the same as the Newgrounds version along with improved camera controls. The game itself can get rather repetitive after a while, so keep that in mind. As of right now the game is pretty simple and easy to learn, which is good for casual players not too familiar with sim games. The more experienced players who loves in-depth micro-management will probably be disappointed.If you have a few bucks lying around and looking for something simple, then this is a nice game to pick-up.\n\nAs an early access game, this is a good start, but I would love to see the developers take the game even further, so\nhere's a short list of improvements that I hope to see in the final release:\n\n*Variety in the games you make (ex. Making games genre hybrids)\n*Improved employee AI (ex. The AI getting a drink and eating when they take a break)\n*Different levels of quality for buildings (ex. Affecting how efficiently employees work)\n*Being able to improve employee's skills (ex. Give them training tasks to hone their skills)\n*More variety in sound and music (ex.

It's cheap fun and you might learn something from it!\n\nSOME SUGGESTIONS, "BUGS" AND FEEDBACK\n################################\n-First of all when I started the game and the endless loop intro came, I had a big smile on my face because in my class we always used to make jokes about endless loops...\n\n-Also I would do something about the void around your studio... You could just make the background bigger and then stop the scrolling before you go out of the "map" or something like that.\n\n-I didn't finish the game by now, but I'm pretty close... At the moment I have to make the 9000Q game, but there's one feature that would be so cool! It might be that it's already in the game but I'm already in San Francisco so I don't think that... I just think you should have more building space in the end, because I would loove to have a really badass office with lots of rooms and stuff!!! I don't think that would be hard to implement! ;)\n\n-I also think it's a bit annoying that you can only place doors one way!

There's much less 'chance' involved, as with Game Dev Tycoon.\n\nThe campaign is fun and took me around 6 hours to complete. Bear in mind that I took my time with this, and didn't rush the campaign, to see it through. I suspect that if someone was truly devoted, they could complete the game in a fraction of the time. The Steam achievements are also easily attainable, and provide a little more playability for the title. Within ten hours, I'd completed the campaign and got 100% of the achievements.\n\nThis game will never be a massive hit, on par with those huge releases by developers with deep pockets etc, but for the £1.49 I spent on it, it's provided me 10 hours of entertainment - and provided me a fix for my 'game cravings' whilst on holiday and using a very technologically limited laptop!","January 1","true","10.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Another few hours of playing around with objects and people to see some difference in game quality, but not much more to do.\n\nFor the price, it's worth it for 6+ hrs of fun. Below I'll lise some things I'd like improved that I think fit within this games price point.\n\n- Save at any time option, though it's pretty easy to speed up time till end of month for auto-save.\n- Better analytics tools, what was the market for that genre at time of release, ability to see market interest in each category historically, so if Shooter is hot right now, but it's been hot for 6 months, I could assume it won't still be interesting in another 6 months when I release my game, so I'll look for which category is starting to increase, or recently hot, ability to lay sales figures of multiple games on same graph, toggleable columns, sometimes I'd like to see how much I spent on marketing vs the sales vs the quality.\n- More control over games, how much effort went into Code/Gfx/Sound/Writing.\n- More control over number of people per project, having a min required, and each section (Code/Gfx etc) have a number of tasks, randomly generated within a preset min/max, and a percentage of these that are sequential, so just thowing more devs at it won't speed it up at a point, and will require you to manage work load and people.\n- Ability to add/remove people from an ongoing project, and a slight penalty for removing someone mid task.\n- Remove fixed 12month game life.","January 1","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/obsidian_age/recommended/399670/","obsidian_age","Obsidian Age","http://steamcommunity.com/id/obsidian_age/","1718 products in account","Game Corp DX is quite similar to Game Dev Tycoon, in that you get to create your own video-game industry. You start out small, and hire more developers as you progress. Developers all have individual needs and traits such as how productive they are, and need to be trained in various software to contribute to a project. There's also an aspect of the classic game The Movies by Lionhead Studios, with competitor studios and an awards ceremy that gives trophies to the best companies.\n\nPositives:\n- A very fun casual game that teaches you about the game development industry.\n\n- The gameplay is very easy to learn, though still incredibly enjoyable.\n\n- You unlock more skilled employees and new equipment as you progress. You also get larger studio space at each city you unlock.\n\n- The artwork is quaint and definitely adds to the appeal of the game.\n\nNegatives:\n- You're really pressed for space in your studio as you progress, as you must hire all 'local' potential employees before moving locaiton to expand your studio. This is exaccerabted by the fact that most objects take up multiple spaces, and you cannot move an object over any existing 'invalid' squares, even if doing so would be a valid move. For example, an object occupies two squares. You move it over one square, which the object itself is already occupying. The game won't let you do this, as you must move the object to a completely different location, *then* to the target location.\n\n- Adventure games seem to take a random hit. I can only assume this is to make the achievement related to earning more than $20m from an advetnure title harder. At the end of the game, no-one has basically *any* interest in adventure games, making this task very difficult.\n\n- The informtion boxes are ridicuously small. You can increase their size, but this blurs the text. Also, in many cases some text will float off the screen, making it unreadable. I set the text size to the highest setting, so this may not be as bad for smaller texts.\n\nConclusion:\nGame Corp DX is a really fun game and a great way to kill a few hours. It's an enjoyable game that does a good job at what it is trying to do. For the price, you get many hours of enjoyable gameplay, so I can definitely recommend this as a game to pick up!","March 2","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Such as more items, more flexibility with workers (have them assist a project already underway, for example), more going on with the other companies such as espionage or poaching staff, more real-world problems like the system you're developing for going under half-way through development, or perhaps releasing a buggy game you have to provide tech-support for which ties up some of your workforce, or the option to release updated versions of earlier games with newer features, or the opportunity to out-source work which might not get finished or might come back incomplete but is cheaper to do, or the chance to make a sequel to an existing game, which would give you guaranteed sales but more pressure to deliver a good product...or...\n\nYeah, it's cute, but there sadly isn't much to it and you can "finish" it in a couple of hours.","March 7","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I bought it and it's just soo awesome! Especially because I want to be a game developer myself! xD If you are interestet in game design you should definetly buy it! It's cheap fun and you might learn something from it!\n\nSOME SUGGESTIONS, "BUGS" AND FEEDBACK\n################################\n-First of all when I started the game and the endless loop intro came, I had a big smile on my face because in my class we always used to make jokes about endless loops...\n\n-Also I would do something about the void around your studio... You could just make the background bigger and then stop the scrolling before you go out of the "map" or something like that.\n\n-I didn't finish the game by now, but I'm pretty close... At the moment I have to make the 9000Q game, but there's one feature that would be so cool! It might be that it's already in the game but I'm already in San Francisco so I don't think that... I just think you should have more building space in the end, because I would loove to have a really badass office with lots of rooms and stuff!!! I don't think that would be hard to implement! ;)\n\n-I also think it's a bit annoying that you can only place doors one way! I would like to make some entry's from other directions in some rooms....\n\nI hope this review was helpful!

I'll be honest the overlay system doesnt update which is upsetting, and its too dark, and the building system seems unfished because you can't move for example a work desk 1 block up or 1 block down, you have to move it 2 blocks down and then 3 up to get it where you want it. I played on easy mode, so I'm not sure about the other difficulties. But the characters you could get, and the ability to control the project even if in the end all the project really does is get you fans and money, the game really made you feel like you were the lead in the videogame company.

You create your own company, produce video games of your choice and compete against different companies. The goal of this game is to become the company who makes the most money and the biggest studio. I like simulation games, beginning with my interest in Cities: Skyines. This is great but...it feels broken. It's hard to understand the real purpose of the game when the first 20 games you make get terrible reviews, no matter what you do. I love the game mechanics and how you're able to choose the genre and name of your game and how you compete against different companies. It's just frustating though, as training your guys endlessly doesn't seem to do ANYTHING and inevitably you end up going bankrupt. If they ever end up making a better tutorial and make the game feel more rewarding, I'll come back and give it a thumbs up but for now, this game doesn't deserve it.","January 30","false","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/obsidian_age/recommended/399670/","obsidian_age","Obsidian Age","http://steamcommunity.com/id/obsidian_age/","1718 products in account","Game Corp DX is quite similar to Game Dev Tycoon, in that you get to create your own video-game industry. You start out small, and hire more developers as you progress. Developers all have individual needs and traits such as how productive they are, and need to be trained in various software to contribute to a project. There's also an aspect of the classic game The Movies by Lionhead Studios, with competitor studios and an awards ceremy that gives trophies to the best companies.\n\nPositives:\n- A very fun casual game that teaches you about the game development industry.\n\n- The gameplay is very easy to learn, though still incredibly enjoyable.\n\n- You unlock more skilled employees and new equipment as you progress. You also get larger studio space at each city you unlock.\n\n- The artwork is quaint and definitely adds to the appeal of the game.\n\nNegatives:\n- You're really pressed for space in your studio as you progress, as you must hire all 'local' potential employees before moving locaiton to expand your studio. This is exaccerabted by the fact that most objects take up multiple spaces, and you cannot move an object over any existing 'invalid' squares, even if doing so would be a valid move. For example, an object occupies two squares. You move it over one square, which the object itself is already occupying. The game won't let you do this, as you must move the object to a completely different location, *then* to the target location.\n\n- Adventure games seem to take a random hit. I can only assume this is to make the achievement related to earning more than $20m from an advetnure title harder. At the end of the game, no-one has basically *any* interest in adventure games, making this task very difficult.\n\n- The informtion boxes are ridicuously small. You can increase their size, but this blurs the text. Also, in many cases some text will float off the screen, making it unreadable. I set the text size to the highest setting, so this may not be as bad for smaller texts.\n\nConclusion:\nGame Corp DX is a really fun game and a great way to kill a few hours. It's an enjoyable game that does a good job at what it is trying to do. For the price, you get many hours of enjoyable gameplay, so I can definitely recommend this as a game to pick up!","March 2","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It needs a bit of work, for example during pre-production of a big game the bars don't fill when a single person is away from the table.  With 10 People at the table it's almost certain someone will be away due to drinking or eating, even with their bad traits removed, this means the pre production of a game can take half a year or more which can cause issues when using all of your employees for one game.\n\nIt isn't as good as some other game tycoon type games i've played but if more is added and the small issues are sorted it could be.  I sugesst adding some things like events you can hold or go to (similar to RL gamescom and E3 ect) and the possibility to expand your company into the console market in the late game.","January 5","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Could have been a way worse.\n\n\nSounds\nMain themes are actually pretty good, SFX are good too.\n\n\nPlaytime\nI've finished the game in normal mode in more or less 3 hours.

Didn't like how I couldn't expand my office after San Francisco but oh well, guess my different categories of slave workers cant have rooms to themselves and neither can the pre production crews have seperate rooms.\n\nI would have loved to have different music for the game play every now and then. One song after several hours gets extremely annoying. And at the end it can get a bit tedious manually assigning every slave *err* 'employee' to the project and it would have been nice to see an assign highest skilled button somewhere.\n\nBut overall and at 2 bucks it was a really fun game that entertained me for a few hours and I don't regret the purchase.
