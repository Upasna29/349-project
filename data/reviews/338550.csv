There is no tutorial or other modes so i got stuck on the third stage untill i saw the trailer on the store page where he was shooting but there is no cursor to show where you mouse is so you have to trial and error till it starts shooting. Developer is absent in forums and its webpage is beyond basic so dont expect much support for this game down the line. Watch the trailer and you will have seen all this game has to offer.","March 24","false","0.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Okay, I made it through and have now progressed another 7 or 8 levels rapidly so that one level was kind of an anomaly. Also, if you land on the landing pad and the game doesn't end that means your time ran out. This is an incredibly fantastic game that is sure to become one of your favorites. Too bad there aren't more levels.\n\nMy original review - This was a great little game until I got to Gauntlet of the Gods which is not very deep in the game but is just about impossible. Then I get to the landing pad in GotG and it doesn't end the level the way it does in every other level. What kind of sadistic game design is that?\n\nMy experience with Terra Lander started off pleasantly. I liked the vector graphics and the way the lander handled with the X box controller. The robotic voice offered hilariously cruel comments. It was a little hard to distinguish the enemy bullets from all the other sparkles in the game but the first few levels were so easy that they bordered on boring and I barely remember them. Then I got to Gauntlet of the Gods and   there are way too many turrets and tight passageways full of richochet bullets coming from every direction. When you get through areas here you're just memorizing patterns of enemy fire. It feels like luck and memorizing when you get through. You're not really learning anything. Its kind of tedious. Then you get to the end, and this is probably after losing 900 ships and being insulted 3000 times, and you land on the landing pad - nothing happens. It doesn't end the level like it does every other time. I wanted to kill a family with a hammer. (See the top paragraph for an explanation)\n\nThis is not retro or a steep learning curve. Its just lazy level design and early access developer sadism and its too bad because Terra Lander has so much potential. (see top paragraph)","April 16, 2015","true","19.3"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","9","15","2","0"

Terra Lander reminds me old school games which i played on Atari 800 XL. I love simple graphics, great music and "Hawking", who is trying to comment player's failures;-).

A great melody: On the Beautiful Blue Danube by Johan Strauss will accompany through the game, you can´t hate that one. Some will remember the 2001: A Space Odyssey movie when playing. The cynical narrator (presumably Stephen Hawking) will make you smile when you crash the Lunar Pod. The game has a good difficulty as you advance. 20 levels are the downside here.\n\nFor all of those who will play Terra Lander with a keyboard and mouse, I will give you an advice:  when It comes to shoot, just shake a bit your mouse and press left mouse button. I was going crazy the first 10 minutes.\n\nGood replay value If you´re one of those people who just want a simple but fun game to play for an hour tops.\n\nA must have for Retro Gamers. 8/10","April 19","true","1.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
