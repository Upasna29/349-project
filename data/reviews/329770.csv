"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ZenFS/recommended/329770/","ZenFS","The Valeyard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ZenFS/","740 products in account","The latest offering from Phr00t, 4089 has the player take control of an infiltration droid, sent to investigate a cube-shaped mothership that has begun orbiting the planet featured in 3079.\n\nGameplay involves investigating rooms for recharges, weapons, and other items, while dealing with various robots that serve as the ships defenses; these enemies may be destroyed or avoided as per your play style. There are skills the player character has relating to elements such as health, damage, energy, as well as skills for stealth, hacking, and construction tasks. These skills can be increased by collecting a particular type of consumable; each one provides an extra point that can be assigned to any of the available skills.\n\nDifficulty is relatively high, although the player can choose whether to play in "Challange" mode (Perma-death) or "Adventure" mode (infinite lives, but lose a random skill point upon death). Enemies are fairly accurate, so dodging is a highly valued tactic; a quick-dodge can be obtained with enough skill points in Agility.\n\nPros:\n*Immediate action\n*Rogue-like difficulty; enemies and hackable devices do not scale to your level of power\n*Adjacent rooms can be on any side of any room (top & bottom included), creating a 3-dimensional network\n*diversity of combat skills include creating decoys, phasing (time-warp dodging), and sticking to walls\n\nCons:\n*Music is good, but due to the pace of the game, it becomes repetitive\n*Jumping is over-simplified; jump height can not be controlled (as was an option in 3089)\n*Traversing the seams between rooms (doorways included) cause the player character to slow down (due to the angle being so acute)\n\n***The issue with the room seams can be solved by reintroducing the variable jump, or by flattening the angle of the seam edge.\n\nNOTE: Be sure to read the information on the store page; 4089 is not meant to be an open-world experience like 3089 is. Also, the player character in 4089 is a robot designed for infiltration, where-as the player character in 3089 is an experimental combat robot; this is why the weapons system in 4089 is simplified when compared to 3089's.","January 17, 2015","true","6.0"," 45 of 52 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","45","52","3","0"

He really cares about this game, is responsive to technical issues and user feedback, and incorporates that into his project to make it better.\n\nI have to say, I like that style and wish more devs would be as active with their users like this one.   It's worth supporting that kind of hard work.","July 24, 2015","true","0.2"," 26 of 28 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","26","28","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DanknessNShit/recommended/329770/","DanknessNShit","Maggot Man","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DanknessNShit/","13 products in account","Phr00t delivers another first-person RPG just like the past two releases. 4089 is a LOT harder than the past two games but I don't have a problem with it. The guns get crazier and the music remains great. I played the v0.99a demo and I loved it, and since I picked up the game I've been hooked. Stats get a lot simpler, I guess. Only stats you have now are health, energy, damage, engineering, stealth, and agility. Health governs your maximum health, energy governs your maximum energy, damage increases damage output by 10% per point, engineering increases hacking time and lets you build, stealth, well, is really self explanatory and lets you have quieter movement, attacks, invisibility, and enemy tracking. Agility governs your movement speed and will let you double-jump, dash, time warp, and another ability I forgot. It isn't open-world anymore but it gets much more of an unknown factor with the random variation of rooms. Weapons can get damage upgades, a passive ability or an alt-fire ability; one of my personal favorites is stunning. Technically there's no melee but the combo tool has a short range and deals a lot of damage.\n\nSo, onto the storyline. It's a thousand years after the events of 3089 and the Overlord's mothership is orbiting the planet that the events of 3079 are set on, which is now called Zehra (even though we had no idea what it was called for a while). In-game the Overlord says it wanted to study Zehra but Zehra is in a panic because of the Overlord's ship orbiting over it. A joint Humoid-Neander force sends thousands of probes in the hopes some will breach the Overlord's ship and get through its defenses. I haven't completed the game yet but the description of the game says you can decide what to do with the Overlord at the end. No idea what your choices are.\n\n4089's got a lot of modding capability and you can create and/or edit rooms, enemies, weapons, sound, models, and textures. Won't be long before someone makes an automatic railgun or an assault rifle that fires explosive bullets. As far as I know you can't make your own weapon upgrades but if you actually can that'd be pretty cool. That would lead to being able to use a scope on weapons, something tells me.\n\nTLDR: 4089 is a first-person RPG with rock-solid mechanics that is set 1,000 years after 3089. The Overlord's ship has begun to orbit Zehra, the planet that 3079 is set on. Panic ensues on Zehra, and it forces Humoids and Neanders to send thousands of probes in the hopes some or all will breach into the Overlord's ship and get it away from Zehra. It's down to you to save Zehra.\n\nRating: 10/10. Difficult at first but gets somewhat easier as you progress onward. The difficulty will still ramp up as you progress but I feel that's the way roguelikes are supposed to be. Good work, phr00t. Good work.\n\nEdit: I figured out one of the endings but I won't spoil it. Go play it yourself! :)","March 17, 2015","true","17.4"," 26 of 30 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","26","30","0","2"

This may not seem all interesting, But as a fan of the movie cube this is actually really awesome as everything is divided into cubes as you would expect, but also you can be in a room where you may be able to go up, or down to another area instead of just going through corridors all the time, theres also a good amount of variation as its not always square to square room you go through.\n\nAs for the other stuff, Yeah it has pickups and stuff as you expect but i have not played enough to comment on items avalible, It has the key mechanics of a great game though.","January 11, 2015","true","0.5"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","16","20","2","0"

This is about you, your environment, and the entity you're up against.\n\nIn that, it does it well.\n\nAll the same, I can't help but hope we get to see a return to the roots of 3079, using this beautiful engine, and of course some Oculus Rift support thrown in for good measure.\n\nAll in all, one of my favourite Oculus experiences.","March 19, 2015","true","0.6"," 22 of 31 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","22","31","0","0"

The combat is marginally dumbed down, with that sick time slowing feature removed, along with early access to invisibility, alongside that gun that let you teleport, alongside the hoverboard and I haven't encountered some of the gun types I encountered in 3089. The omission of melee weapons irritated me a great deal. I don't care how objectively strong they were in 3089, they were fun, and a great addition and I see no reason to remove them. Also, you no longer have any armor or chips. These simplifications are irritating, but they wouldn't matter if the game stood on its own as a fun roguelike, and it doesn't. The hacking is unbearable and the combat is irritating. The enemies' projectiles borderline home in on you which requires you to play stupidly safe, and the hacking, oh god. The hacking is essentially based on whether you can luckily get through the one correct path quickly enough, and if you're unlucky enough to make two bad moves in a row or to run out of time you take damage. Now this would be fine but you absolutely have to hack to win the game and there is no way to make hacking easier and it is not a fun challenge. Hacking is like a maze which you have to navigate really quickly, with no inherent idea of which way is corrrect, and I feel it's just too hard. Sometimes you can avoid hacking by using vents in the roof, but sometimes you cannot, and the hacking really turns me off of this game.\n\nThis game does get better as you go on, but difficulty, and more importantly fun, as in most rogue likes, is largely determined by luck. It is because of that, the impact luck has on the game, that I didn't like it.","January 28, 2015","false","0.4"," 43 of 78 people (55%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","55","43","78","3","12"

But with adventure mode dieing to many times will also mean you have to restart the game.\nCause every time you die you lose 1 stat point.\n\nIts a good game to just play for a few hours and play again over time.\nI give it 7 out of 10 points.\nMusic fits well with the surroundings and a hardcore game!

Phr00t has a unique way of naming his games :) I have the 2 previous games, and when I realised 4089 was released I bought it immediately.\n\nThis game is more FPS than RPG, when compared to previous games. Granted I've only run around maybe 10 to 15 rooms altogether (I keep getting lost! I really need to map it out) so far, but I have not seen the same kind of "RPG-ness" prevalent in previous games 3079 and 3089. At best you only can allocate skill points to your various attributes... and you can pickup and change weapons.\n\nBut there's no real "inventory" (yet?) to speak of, no armour, not crafting etc.\n\nThe grappling hook is still there, and it's your starter weapon... so yeah you can swing around the place like Tarzan, reaching weird corners in rooms to find powerups and weapons.\n\nAs an FPS, it's fun... it's frantic... and sometimes frustrating cuz I keep going around to visited-rooms. You can do the "go in guns blazing" thing or you can do the "sneaking around" thing too... depends on which attributes you've selected to increase. Also, on the whole it has a pretty "old-school" feel to it too. Many modern FPSes have in-game maps and waypoints to show you where to go... 4089 doesn't. I probably would have to get a pen and paper and map the rooms out and show how they are connected :p\n\nOne of the highlights for my games is that I keep hearing how the Overlord keeps trying to justify their actions. Kind of like the, in the movies, the serial killer keeps taunting you as you're running around.\n\nOne major new addition is probably the moddability support built into the game - right on the main menu there is a "Room Viewer" and you can edit and create your own rooms to add into the game. Full instructions are provided at the game's website.\n\n","January 27, 2015","true","3.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

It seems that the way to go is seeing which weapon you get at the beginning and then building your stats around that weapon, or restarting.\n\nStealth seems underpowered. Yes, being seen later by enemies is good, but the invisibility mechanic eats a lot of energy, especially since you want to land a powerful hit for bonus damage when coming out of it, which leads to the next point.\n\nEnergy, as was explained to me, only regenerates by itself for 30%. Meaning if you go for a while spending much energy without finding energy pickups or recharge stations, you'll be suffering from a decreased energy pool (especially since you will rarely have weapons for both high energy usage and low energy usage.)\n\nThe death mechanic seems counterintuitive. When you die you respawn in an empty room nearby and lose 1 stat point. Stat points can't be found infinitely, meaning each death makes you weaker.\n\nThe Good:\n\nEven though you can't customize your playstyle as you want in every playthrough (and have a chance at victory), it is very enjoyable to pick up your starting weapon and find a way to make it work.\n\nMovement with the grapling hook feels pretty good, and 3d maneuving makes for interesting fights.\n\nThe game is challenging (a good kind of challenging if you look beyond the bad points) and the randomly generated dungeon definitely makes it replayable. Also, if you die, (there's a permadeath and limited lives option) you can quickly find yourself in a new game, like in any good roguelike.\n\nAdditionally, something I don't value personally that much, but I know that other gamers do, the game has decent graphic options, AA up to x16, and a field of view setting, among others.\n\nFazit:\n\nIf you like challenging roguelikes, and some of the mechanics that hinder either your playtyle or chances of success get balanced or changed, I can definitely reccomend this. In the current version (v1.130), it felt unfair or frustrating sometimes, and I had to restart, but most of the time it was fun.","January 25, 2015","true","1.9"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Also it would be nice if the grappling hook would shoot a bit faster so you could use it to gain momentum and fly around like a monkey swinging from trees ;D\n-  As of me writing this review, the gameplay and difficulty you have through each playthrough depends on which weapons you happen to be given. Throughout all the rooms, it's very rare to find new weapons to choose from. It would be nice if there were a choice of a few different weapons right at the beginning which you could then upgrade through the playthrough.\n- The music is good but gets a bit repetitive, t'would be great if there were just a few more tracks.\n- Every time I start the game I have to re-set my antialiasing settings at the settings screen, it doesn't seem to save each time. Not a biggie, just a little annoying.\n- Setting down blocks is a bit pointless at the moment, seeing as you cant really duck to take cover behind them. Instead of blocks it'd be much better if you could place something else to start such as mines, traps, jump pads, gravity field cancellation machines ;)","January 25, 2015","true","3.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Sadly, I liked them more. :(\n\nShort review below...\n\n4089 Is a very straight forward game with a sort of rogue-like twist. There's no mucking about and nothing to distract you from your goal. You are placed inside a maze of rooms and have to make your way deeper and deeper into the facility in order to locate and "destroy" an evil AI.\n\nEach room in the game can have multiple exits and sometimes link together in odd ways such as through ventilation shafts or can be stacked vertically on top of each other.  Some rooms contain enemies who have basic AI to attack you and may follow you through a door but for the most part they just face you and shoot. Sometimes you may find a locked door or a computer console that allows you to hack locked doors that are in other rooms. Also you may rarely find a station that allows you to recharge some of your health and energy.\n\nThat's it so far. I've only played 3 games and made it about 15-20 rooms deep each time before encountering enemies much stronger than I could tackle or a locked door I could not solve in the hacking game time limit. Apparently this is intended to teach me a lesson that I made the wrong choices during gameplay? It felt more like the random level design didnt play to my favor.\n\nThe music is good but I find it way too loud. I had to set my music volume ingame to 10%! I liked the music but it also falls into the trap of hearing the same tune over and over. Even if some of the songs might be a few minutes long you end up hearing the first 30 seconds a lot because of combat transitions. Also the transitions are really hard with no fade in and out of the music which I found really harsh.\n\nThe enemy AI has a voice over that sort of narrates the story for you as you move deeper into the game. I found the writing pretty damn good for an indie game and the robotic voice was passable but might have been nice with some real voice acting.\n\nI will try more again later but it does feel like a shadow or a minigame that could have been at the end of the previous game rather than it's own title.\n\nSo far I rate 3000/4089 It seems decent but just not that fun to me.","January 13, 2015","false","2.9"," 11 of 25 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","11","25","0","3"

Really enjoyed the previous two games in this series, but the following points ruin this one:\n\n* Boring combat/reduced gameplay - the removal of several of the features from 3089 (such as slow-mo and melee weapons) means that now you and the enemies are just two entities who see each other and instantly start firing until one falls over. If you're lucky you will be able to position yourself so that your gun is barely poking around an object and essentially use poor clipping to win.\n\n* No open world - instead we have a claustrophobic dungeon where the procedural generation can often leave you disorientated and searching for a tiny air duct in a long series of rooms. The rooms themselves are pretty boring, a far cry from the massive landscapes of previous games.\n\n* Terrible, TERRIBLE, hacking mini-game.\n\nThe dev has been impressive with updates in the past, perhaps the same will be true here... but for now avoid this half-game and get 3089 instead.","May 31, 2015","false","1.6"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","3","0","1"
