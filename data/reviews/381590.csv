Most cant complete a game much less do so and then port it to another system.\n\nThe menu controls seem backwards and the game is def a mobile port as you can tell.\nExperienceing a glitch once is not an issue to me as I dont have the patience of a 10 year old so all the little quirks of the game literally are nothing to ruin the experience by any means nor give me a reason to make an "I'm a cool kid this game is so broken" review.\n\nIf a finicky menu is enough to make you quit a game or you cant get thru the tutorial then maybe you need to reconsider if gaming is really for you.\n\nIts no trials HD thats for sure. For a mobile port its a fine game but if you havent played trials then id go for that before trying this. Thisgame does highlight a need for more biking type games on PC. Mtn Biking and BMX games are lacking severely in all platforms of gaming but PC esp. I would really love to see a Downhill Mtn Biking or BMX game done extremely well someday but I doubt it will ever happen.\n\nIf you have the money to burn or see this in a bundle or a sale for cheap then try it out. If its your last 5$ in the world then wait for a better deal or just go eat a burger","July 9, 2015","true","0.7"," 49 of 76 people (64%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","64","49","76","7","16"

I remember playing these sort of games for free online so it's a bit of a wonder how it ended up in my library. Is it worth full price? In my opinion no, but it would be worth a second look on sale. This game is OK but do not expect anything beyond what you see. I will recommend it but if you don't find it appealing watching the videos, I doubt you'll find it fun while playing.\n\nShred! is a linear side to side 2D sort of platformer scroller in which the player is in control of a cyclist attempting to meet goal demands by either doing tricks or getting a lot of speed and air. There are two views to choose from : first person and 3rd person from an angled side view. First person is pretty awesome but some will be disappointed in it's function. In first person view, you may be tempted into turning to the sides to explore the track but reluctantly, you'll flipping your bicycle instead. This is sort of bad because the game isn't meant to be open world but good because your obeying the laws of the game (meaning this is how it's function is based). Most likely you'll be playing in third person view in order to properly land your flips and tricks. The physics in game seem to play out properly once you get the hang of them. Holding down "A" allows you to charge up your jump. In order to maximize it, let it go at a certain point approaching a ramp. The timing is a bit tricky but becomes sort of a fun challenge throughout the game. Using your momentum right and timing your jumps correctly brings the game up to a good speed. Once you hit this ideal speed, it's time to throw in some flips and some tricks. Tricks are done with the right joystick and are relatively easy to do and enjoyable to watch. Unfortunately when you master this, there is not a whole lot more to do than memorizing the workings of the courses. Then, it becomes easy. There are certain courses that will give you a challenge but doing the same thing over and over again may get to you. However, there are those that will find (as they unlock more courses) that they enjoy the challenge. Then again, there are those who will dislike the fact you have a button to make your player peddle up a hill that slows the game down.\n\nThe graphics are decent (at best) in the game. There are some nice backdrops (especially in first person) but nothing extremely out of the ordinary. Sounds are okay but aren't exactly diverse. Music is okay but suitable to the game.\n\nIn summary, it's an average game. In my own opinion, I believe games like this should be free simply due in part that I played games like this for free online when I was a kid. I find it increasingly odd what people can charge (but hey, if someone's buying it then it all makes sense).\n\n\nRATING : 6.0/10\n\n\nScreenShots\nAir time\n\nI'm really hoping it's only my game that does this\n\nA glimpse into first person view\n\nThe tutorial does a good job introducing you to the games mechanics\n","January 24","true","0.9"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/killtothis/recommended/381590/","killtothis","killtothis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/killtothis/","967 products in account","Take the game for what it is, a budget title created by a single indie developer. No it's not going to win any awards for graphical fidelity, yes there are going to be some physics bugs. Given the low price of the game I think these factors can be overlooked especially when you consider how fun the game can actually be, as another reviewer has pointed out it has that "one more go" mentality, you can attempt a short amount of time with the game, dive in and do a few runs quickly before you realise an hour has gone past.\nThe tracks themself have a good "flow" to them, providing you hit the right landings etc it's as if your line is an extension of one motion, hit them wrong and it's pretty unforgiving, there's lots of possibilities and replayability in just getting that "line" right on each trail.\nI think the game complements the Trials series pretty well and its apparent that it provided some inspiration for the title, it's not as polished nor is there as much content but for the price again that can be forgiven.\nI have no hesitation in recommending the game providing you purchase it with the right attitude, it's definitely far from a AAA title but as a fun time distraction it serves up quite well.\nLooking forward to see what the developer brings to the table in the future.","July 9, 2015","true","1.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

I purchased both this version and the mobile version a long while ago, both of which I enjoyed playing through and would reccommend to anyone who enjoys biking or gaming. When playing with a controller the stick sensitivity was an issue for me, so a sensitivity bar in the options menu wouldn't go amiss (unless i've missed one somewhere), also I really like the first person camera, and spent a good half an hour-45 minutes playing 1 level over and over just because I enjoyed it so much. In order to fully enjoy this I feel that this may require some patching and control changes, such as forward and backward on the sticks on a controller, instead of left and right. Other than these small issues (and a couple of bugs, which, lets be honest, are HILARIOUS), this game is awesome and I love it to bits. :)","July 19, 2015","true","10.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It is hilarious. The glitchyness is one of the best parts of the game. If you fall off your bike and it escape and then go back to the game, the guy just randomly flies into the air. That is amazing. Much more in depth of a game than I imagined it would have since it was soley made by one guy. I would wait for it to go on sale before buying. But I do reccommend this, it is pretty fun. I really don't like the menus though. Very clunky and ugly.","November 3, 2015","true","28.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
