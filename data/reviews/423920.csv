Cant say i would play it often enough, but i can already see the devs are in development of new stuff :)\nAlso, The Graphics are very very retro / 8 bit can barely make out what some things / Words are To Be Honest :/ Just one of very few negatives.\n\nEDIT: I found a negative.... Player Progression was wiped when the game updated, Hopefully this doesnt happen every update... And it seems WWAAAYYY to easy to progress, but at the moment there isnt much to progress to.... Levels are Easy to get, and buildings are easy to make.\n\nALSO, The devs have published an Android and iOS version... So they wont be solely Steam dedicated like most Developers Unfortunately. ( On that note, if you want to try the game before you buy... Search for "Etaria Lite" in the App Store.","February 4","true","1.0"," 34 of 47 people (72%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","72","34","47","3","0"

Then you spawn in a randomly generated infinite world of sidescrolling propertions with caves you can explore aswell. I only played a little bit but enjoyed what i've seen so far, i slaughtered wolves, giant snakes, giant spiders, ghosts, bunnies, sheeps, ((Don't think of killing a squirrel with an axe, they hide in trees). You chop down trees, collect rocks, minerals, food, then you build your own village. I only built one house so far but i created a villager by using the bed inside the house. You can even store items in chests inside houses it's really neat. I stored spider legs, wolf skins, wool and items i have no idea how to use yet. I recommend this game if you like a casual gameplay and relax, but also explore at the same time. Got level 5 and died, looks like death=permadeath so it's really survival, watch out in those caves!","February 4","true","1.4"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","17","26","2","0"

The world is infinitre and generated as you play, but divided into sections. I am reluctant to call it an actual platformer, you mostly just go left or right, you can jump but there's no "platforms" to jump to. It feels very similar to Zelda II on the NES when you go into random world map battles. Each section is one of multiple biome types, forest, fields, marshland, and desert seem to be the most common though there may be others. Each section has a "level range" for enemies showing you how powerful the enemies in that area are, and they progressively get more powerful the further from where you start.\n\nThe goals of the game are not well defined, there doesn't appear to be a set objective except to create a village, you can ignore this to some extent but progression is tied into having a village. The village building system is very basic, you start by defining which section you want to be your village, have 10 logs in your inventory, and then walls are placed up around it. After that you can use resources you've found like logs, stones, minerals, and food to add to stores you build which add to the village resources and let you build more buildings. Each house you build adds one villager and you can define jobs for them by building special homes for that job. The jobs appear to be Soldier, Archer, Miner, Forester, Farmer, and Woodcutter, with Forge & Shop automatically coming with their own merchants.\n\nAs you kill enemies and collect resources from the world you will gain XP and level up, each level up lets you increase one of 3 stats, attack power (also impacts woodcutting speed), defense, and health pool. You can sell various items you collect at a shop to buy new weapons and armor. Combat is extremely simple, you just hit the LMB and you swing in the direction you are facing, and most enemies will just attack you directly, Spiders appear to be the worst because they will sometimes jump at you making them the most likely culprit of killing you. The game appears to be permadeath as you will lose your save game when you die.\n\nAll in all it's not a bad game by any means but it feels low on content, the randomly generated world is only interesting up until you've seen every biome, after which one desert looks the same as any other. The UI is pretty basic but not very intuitive, it's simple once you learn it but it definitely feels like a mobile port (which I think it is). So if you just want to play a simple little sidescrolling village sandbox game check it out, the price isn't bad, but don't expect it to give you days and weeks worth of content to explore.","February 14","true","5.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

For example its a nightmare to turn around, fighting is slow and difficult, meaning that an enemy like a spider can hit you then jump straight over you and you wont get a single hit another example is hunting you hit something and it runs right past you and by the time you turn the ♥♥♥♥ around you've lost it!\nthey really need to work on player movement meaning that you should be able to turn without pushing a button but when you look somewhere with the mouse he turns that would be very usefull. game overall is a 7/10 because i died like 4 times purely because of this issue. Please fix this turning crap.\n\nLatest review\n-This is an old Review i expected the game to be finished soon but the devs must of thought ♥♥♥♥ it i suppose so dont buy it at all. i would not spend more than 30 p on this game.","February 7","false","3.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
