There are flaws, there are bugs, I regularly get dropped by the server. There are trolls online, both intentionally trolling and unintentionally (if you don't know what offside is, read up on it before playing!) But what it does have going for it is sheer fun factor.\n\nIf you remember Sensible Soccer, WoSO is in a similar vein, from the pixel graphics to sharing more than a little in common with Sensible World of Soccer's name. But as the telling difference in the name reveals, WoSO is an online game. You control just one player, with the other players on your team controlled by other humans (yay) or the AI (boo). And it's this multiplayer element that is at the heart of WoS's fun factor. As in real life football, playing as a team is essential; good positioning is worth a lot and a team playing as a unit can still beat a team full of better players who are all playing for themselves. It can be really satisfying when your team puts together a string of neat passes culminating in a goal, or when you've spent 90 minutes defending resolutely only to nick a 1-0 victory in the dying moments on the counter.\n\nControls are relatively simple; movement is via mouse (run to the cursor a la diablo), gamepad or keyboard (not a good option IMO). I'm using a controller where you have 3 buttons that I'd call "shoot" "lob" and "pass". The controls are not well explained, although there is a tutorial that gives you the basics. Bascially "lob" is a high ball, "pass" is a low ball and "shoot" increases in height with power. Hold down the button to power up. You can also control the height of the ball by either moving the mouse cursor nearer or further from your player, or moving your joystick in a similar fashion. "lob" performs a slide tackle when defending. Headers are finicky at first, but basically involve either the "pass" or "shoot" buttons ("lob" will make you slide instead).\n\nThere are no fouls - strategically taking out opponents is part of the game and underlines the arcade feel of the game. Offsides are implemented, so no goal hanging allowed. Other than that there are 3 player models (small/normal/large) you can choose from if you pay for a VIP account. The small players are however vastly overpowered (they are quicker than everyone else) and I personally find it gets boring quickly if one team has several fast players and the other doesn't; you can essentially run the entire length of the pitch with the ball without being caught, which removes any element of tactics from the game. I think there needs to be a better model for financing the servers than one that makes the game less fun (IMO of course) for everyone.\n\nOther downsides include:\nNo ability to kick players. AFK players can ruin matches by playing everyone onside and making teams unbalanced. The same player may be AFK for over half an hour and isn't kicked.\nAs with any online game, there are trolls. But most players are very friendly. If you have the bad luck of joining a server full of 13 year olds, best to switch to another server. As per usual, things get better later at night when the kids are in bed.\nNo real auto-balancing of training matches. While the game assigns new players who join the server to the team with less players, an auto-balancing feature would be nice - at the very least at the start of each match, if not each half. Unbalanced matches are no fun. A lot of players will however change teams to balance things out. A match-making mode is supposedly on the way, which should help in this regard.\nA few weird bugs/idiosyncracies lead to WTF moments every now and then. Nothing to ruin the game though.\nThe league and team systems don't work. The leagues are full of dead teams and playing matches between teams is a pain, especially as it's uncommon for 6 players in the same team to be online at the same time. I much prefer 6v6 (the maximum), so I spend almost all my time playing training matches. I find 1v1 and 2v2 matches fun for a few minutes, but not for a whole match.\nThere are a number of exploits in the game. Some are obvious exploits, some are at the very least gamey. You don't have to take advantage of them of course.\nThe dev does respond to requests and suggestions, and there have been several changes made to the game since release - many good, some bad, and some neither here nor there. However, active development and a willingness to engage with players is always a good thing.\n\nSeeing as WoSO is free, there's no reason not to try it our if you like football games - especially if you were a Sensi fan back in the day. This isn't a game for the people who buy FIFA or PES for the skill moves and motion capture graphics. WoSO is much more tactical - yet also more arcadey- than those 2, by virtue of its simple nature. If you do try it out, definitely play the tutorial and practice knocking the ball about a bit. Play a couple of matches on an empty server both with and without bots to practice passing and shooting. It only takes a short while to master the basic controls. It'll take you a long time to master the game though.","October 28, 2015","true","045.5"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","23","28","0","0"

Full controller support and easy to navigate interface to get into games/matches. You control one footballer on the pitch and the other players are real people from around the world. 3 pressure sensitive buttons make up the game controls. If you've ever played this sport in real life, watched this sport, or played any of the other major soccer games...you will have an advantage over people who know nothing about this sport. That's a good thing, and it feels really rewarding when you play the game. It's a free game that isn't at all pay to win. You'll get into it fast. The only issue is that the game at times can lag if you select a match on a high pink server. I've found servers every time I go into the game as low as 24 ping, and been able to play on this without issue. The developer is working on this issue and working to add other features to the game. Give this game a try, and then talk your friends into it.

It allows you to play the sport we all love in a way that most games do not let you. It removes the arcadey experience of "Be a Pro" modes in larger games and gives you full control over your player's actions. Like the best games, it's easy to learn and hard to master. It will take some time for you to learn the intricacies of the game, but when you do, and you actually find a team and "click" with them, it makes for one of the most satisfying gaming experiences you'll ever know.\n\nThe controls might not be the most obvious for people who haven't played it before, but you can quickly learn what is possible and then, practice makes perfect.\n\nHaving played its predecessor since 2006, and having spent an embarassing amount of hours on it, I can only recommend to you from experience that it's something you should try if you feel like playing football with your friends and make sick plays, but don't feel like getting kicked in the shins.\n\nThe game itself does feel like it's not yet completely functional, some things aren't very intuitive (like chat) and it can definitely become a lot better, but I still recommend you try it.","September 5, 2015","true","4.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Most of them suck so much balls that u wanna go cry and uninstall the game. But do not despair: Eventually you will find players who will notice your skills and invite you to their team unless youre a total ret.ard and cant play at all. In that case you end up playing training matches forever with lack of defensive players and terrible (if at all) passing plays\n\nLately i joined a rather decent team with more or less able players. Once you get used to the shooting and passing system you get to see the real potential of the game. The key is to anticipate the ball´s curvature when in air and try to load your shot as early as possible and release it on touch to get nice tiki taka style passing. Basic shooting on goal is rather easy. It takes more skill to score from a greater distance or at narrow angles.\n\nDownload it, play it for a couple of days and unless you´re not the least skilled player of all times you should be able to get used to the controls (mouse only or gamepad) and be a valueable part of your team.","September 8, 2015","true","170.8"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","47","8","17","4","0"

There's no keymap guide on the settings menu, it was all a good guess that on the general tab on the forums someone would post it and there's no stamina, so instead of playing positions everyone chases the ball and no offside also, you just wait for a cross to 1v1 the goalkeeper just to ultimately fail at scoring, because you can't shoot properly.\n\nYou have to be vip to change your characters size that determines your speed, so by being slow you have to lightly tap the shoot button to kip the ball, but the f*ing lag, you tap the button and your character kick the ball away. Theres no other way, you either tap the ball or get tackled from behind, and when somene do that they can get a free kick, because the football rules in this game where created by some obese programmer that has never seen sunlight in his life, or played real "soccer", or maybe that happens because of the lag or the netcode is f*d up.\n\nPlaying this game is like finding out you have cancer.","September 6, 2015","false","1.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

Mainly because it is one.\nWith my experience, the gameplay is the same - either too balanced, or too unbalanced. What do I mean?\n\nWell, this game would have been tons more fun if you could upgrade your player to specific stats, so training rooms and teams could require a specific level cap (so it isn't too unbalanced).This would create strategy (that is missing from the game) and complexity, trying out new styles and possibly being a fun experience. However, we settle for this - a really basic unfinished product where every character plays the exact same.\n\nWhen in matches, unless you're teamed up with people who aren't selfish ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, you'll find that the only person defending is your keeper (who is CPU controlled), every teammate ever would just act like a hero and come up forth, ignoring basic offside rules, ultimately screwing up the team. This could be countered by adding a ratings system based on the player's performance in his positon, so these ratings stick to a player after each game so people could know how much of a ♥♥♥♥ he is. But I'm not here trying to convince the devs to put a little bit more balance (or fun complex unbalance) to the game even though it would be great. I'm here to advise you whether this game is worth it or not.\n\nIn conclusion, this game is an unsuccessful attempt at a minimum viable product, every player plays the same, basic physics and rules aren't that well implemented, slide tackles are too op (since there isn't any fouls) so you find everybody just lunging at each other at the speed of light, and the whole experience is just the same every time. This game neither showcases the random exciting nature of the real sport, nor does it showcase the players' skills. And that would be a good thing, if the game was just a simple fun experience, but it definitely isn't one. I'd advise the devs to take what they've learned from this failed attempt and focus on improving on the core formula, since this could be a great title, until then - I wouldn't recommend this title.","September 8, 2015","false","1.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game is like Netsoccer 3 for me. And i must say... IT'S BETTER THAN FIFA AND PES!\n\nThis game is really ADDICTIVE and CHALLENGING! It reminds me the times i played football with my friends on school. Here is the same. Each user controls ONLY one player and that fact turns this game REALLY ADDICTIVE.\n\nWorld of Soccer Online is a proof that a great football game doesn't need to be like FIFA or PES (having great graphics, etc). A great gameplay is enough.\n\nYes, the game it's lagging due to the hundreds of players online at the same time, but THIS IS STILL IN ALPHA VERSION! The owner will improve a lot this game, fixing the bugs and problems. He just need some time to do everything that he needs to do.\n\n9/10 - It's one of the BESTEST FOOTBALL GAMES in the world, if not the BEST football game ever created!\n\nwww.marcostrindade.com","August 27, 2015","true","83.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/isnert/recommended/393410/","isnert","Oh Boy I Love Waffles","http://steamcommunity.com/id/isnert/","60 products in account","Overall Review: 7.5/10\n\nOverviewThis game is great. The servers have a bad history, but after a bit the creators got new servers up and running and logins are working flawlessly. The person making this game is a previous developer of Net Soccer, and it shows. The UI is the most painful thing in this game, expecially when it was back when the servers were trashy, but since the game just went up from greenlight it's okay to have some inconvience riddled inside.\n\nGameplayThe controls are, if not exactly a replica of, a close copy of Net Soccer, which controls very well. I like the ball lob mechanic the most, and the slide tackle works very well. I've never played Outdoor Soccer(Football), but these seem very nice for the game. The AI controlled players are very well created too, I'm honestly suprised at how well they preform. You can call to them to pass the ball to you, but I wish it made some notification so that you could notify other players as well.\n\nCommunity & Online PlayThe community isn't that great according to some people, but I haven't seen one person that is too rude or plain annoying yet. The team system is well made too, You can make your own custom jerseys, which look actually nice in game. The organised matches are the bread and butter of this game and I love to play in them. With good communication you can make great plays and tactics, and its overall very well done.\n\nConclusionOverall I think this game could DEFINITELY use some changes over time, but for only 3 days on steam, it looks amazing and plays very well. The reason for my lower score is that the UI needs some serious reworking to be usable. He possibly needs to find some community members to help with that, most of them would know how it should be done to fit to the player, considering they are the community.","September 1, 2015","true","10.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unfortunately it suffers badly with lag and the controls are naff.  Who's bright idea was it to use keyboard key "A" to perform a slide tackle.  Im constantly looking at my keyboard for "A".  Why not have left mouse button to pass and shoot and right mouse button to tackle???  Love the concept and I grew up with SWOS as a kid and have bee waiting for something like this for years.  Great that you can play online leagues and join different teams, great that you play just 1 position on the team.

They pass to the most random places where nobody even is. When they shoot, their shot becomes unstoppable to save and almost always goes into the back of the net.

Games haven't shown any lag yet and are very easy to join. Feels almost identical to Sensible Soccer but with analog movement and shooting (tested with 360 controller).\n\nThe big difference however is that you only control one player, so chasing the ball around junior-school-style will only get your team ripped to shreds against any team with a bit of tactical nous. This opens up interesting decisions; should you play attack or defence, or adapt as the game flows?\n\nIt'd be good if they added an offline mode with switchable players like the original "Sensi" just for fun and practice. It'd be even better if we could have local 2-4 player games in that mode as well.\n\nI've also seen a few complaints about the UI. I've seen better certainly, but it does what it needs to do and I didn't feel it detracted from the experience.\n\nOverall, it's a great free game that's fun and hardly takes up any space.

Controls are simple, yet the game has a lot of depth, which you uncover as you keep playing. What's best is that there are no statistics like speed, stamina, shooting, or what have you. It's all about your SKILL!\n\nGame provides several control schemes: mouse only, mouse + keyboard, and controller only. My favorite is mouse only. It's very well done! It solves the traditional problem of keyboard control -- being able to run only in 8 directions. Mouse control gives you full precision of your passes, shots, and movement.\n\nYou will occasionally meet a griefer, but overall the community is nice. I highly recommend playing with as few players as possible to maximize your time on the ball; you will need some practice to become a respectable footballer.  I had some sick 3v3s and 4v4s last night! Boy what is fun!\n\nWith the addition of tutorial in the last version, it's now easy to pick up basic controls and concepts. The dev seems to be churning out updates constantly. That's always a good sign!\n\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED","September 16, 2015","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Thanks for the fix. Fun game to play :)\n\n\n"Great game to uninstall. It tooks so little space on your hdd and uninstalling will take as short as installing.\n\nThe problem is game menu is lagging. When you open the game, you click menu options one by one and after 5 minutes you see what options you clicked.\n\nI don't believe even worst servers cannot handle 400-500 players. When game is opening it connects to load balancer (that means there are more than one servers and load balancer sends you to the best ping value one) then connects to server. I believe there is some bug on software which makes everything laggy. I mean c'mon, how hard can be to check source code and fix the bug on 90 mb game? Even though writing from scratch shouldn't take so long. There are some people around the world who wants to play sensible soccer like game and this game is ruining all the hopes...\n\nOne more thing, when I realized to write review you need to spend 5 minutes on game, I realized also there is no exit except alt+f4!\n\nOkay uninstalling now."","August 30, 2015","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

It seems simple but it's not. If you keep playing, you can improve yourself. I've played at least half an hour per day for a long time. But then, suddenly, my connection was lost. it's always try to connect the load balance server. I'm not sure if I'm banned or not. I've played this game for 145.7 hours in total. How can i live now? I'm not doing anything wrong. Please take me back if I was banned.","March 29","true","96.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
