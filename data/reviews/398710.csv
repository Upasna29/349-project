Which means that both controller or keyboard controls are sufficient.\n\nYour objective is to cut the tree as much as you can without dying. On both sides of the tree, there are branches. If you cut the tree from the left side, and a branch falls onto your head, you lose. So instead, you switch to the other side to cut from the right. It's a very simplistic idea, but can have you constantly trying to top your previous score.\n\nAs you play the game, you'll unlock new characters to use. They don't play different, it's purely cosmetic.\n\nYou can also play local or online multiplayer. You win a round by either cutting your tree a lot faster than your opponent, which causes your side of the bar to reach their side, or if they simply mess up and die from a branch.\n\nOverall, it's an incredibly cheap game, with added multiplayer and characters over its mobile version. Simple, yet very addicting.","September 20, 2015","true","4.2"," 67 of 83 people (81%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","81","67","83","9","0"

I was not aware originally, that this is the legit product with 30 million downloads.  I was first introduced to this style of gameplay with an app that came to Steam called Tiki Man.  I thought Tiki Man was really great, but I was unaware that there was a much more complete offering coming to Steam.\n\nFirst of all, gameplay-wise, they are very similar, all you do is push left or right to chop the tree (or tiki) to advance, but there are branches to avoid, so you want to hit the right side of the tree.  You have to do this as fast as you can, and it takes a lot of practise to excel.\n\nThe main difference is that this game is FAR more polished.  This wasn't just thrown together and listed on Steam.  What are the differences, in such a simple game?  They are vast.\n\n- Steam Cloud\n- widescreen graphics (tiki man is only 4:3 aspect)\n- controller support\n- local co-op side-by-side action!\n- online play!\n- achievements!\n- trading cards!\n- leaderboards!\n- half of the price!\n\nThere are so many reasons to love this game.  My favorite is the Steam Leaderboards (+ Cloud), because what better way to encourage you to do better and better is to see how your ranking changes worldwide.  Also the couch co-op style of competitive multiplayer is a great, I can't wait to find someone to try it out with me.\n\nThis is the real deal, folks.  Buy this game.  It is a very, very high quality tree cutting thing.  Super addictive, and it has everything you could ask for.\n\nThe game is like $1, which is a very good value, but if you wanted you could try it in your web browser for free (with ads plastered everywhere).\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3J2vmwwpSs","September 18, 2015","true","3.3"," 62 of 86 people (72%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","72","62","86","11","13"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rainwaste/recommended/398710/","rainwaste","Vince Maes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rainwaste/","521 products in account","Introduction\nHere’s the premise: a team of time-travelling lumberjacks have reached Gaia, the immortal tree mother and have to chop at her as fast as possible, lest she grow too tall and cover the sun itself. With meteorite axes fused in the heart of the sun, each swipe of Gaia removes another chunk from her life-force. They are more than lumberjacks, they’re the saviours of earth itself.\n\nNow, all of that was made up but it sounds about right. There is no story to Timberman, just the swing of an axe and the hope of a high score.\n_________________________________\n\nGameplay\nIn Timberman, you tap either left or right on your arrow keys to chop at a presumably infinite tree trunk. Chop at either side, but do your best to avoid incoming branches. One hit of these, and it’s game over. Each chop lowers the tree, as well as a branch. There’s a greedy timer as well that runs on the top of the screen, and is refilled with each chop of the tree.\n\nTo sum it up, if you’ve played Flappy Bird, Trip Runner or any one of the billions of infinite running games, you’ll love Timberman. It’s just newer, faster and has better controls. Also, the chop-chop-chopping rhythm of the axe is hypnotically soothing.\n\nThere's also multiplayer in the form of either local splitscreen or a random online player you get matched up with.\n\nGraphics\nTake heed. Timberman’s a retro game so at this point in the review, you either hate it instantly or love it dearly. The barrage of cutesy 8-bit games are fun, but have begun to wear thin. I’m no game developer, but isn’t it more satisfying to simply have clean, sharp graphics instead of a pixelated mess? I like the graphics, and the gameplay is undemanding enough to warrant Timberman’s pared-down aesthetic. I’ve just grown weary of these 8-bit style games.\n\nConclusion\nTimberman carefully balances frustration with necessity thanks to an incredibly simple control-scheme of either left or right to chop. Chop well enough, and unlock a barrage of cutesy Timbermen which thankfully have no effect on the gameplay.\n_________________________________\n\nVerdict        Chop trees, compete for the highest score, rinse and repeat. Great game, is it worth your dollar? Maybe.","September 18, 2015","true","3.6"," 45 of 63 people (71%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","71","45","63","27","0"

Now, before the fan boys start bashing me for going against the wave, I'd rather you read the review first and see for yourself if I have a legitimate reason for not recommending this.\n\nThe game is addictive..... or not?\nThe top reviews you'll see on the store page will say the same thing. This game is very addicting. Maybe that's true.. maybe it's not it varies from person to person as for me, it's not addicting one bit. I was itchy to keep retrying and beat my previous score when I first bought the game but after closing it one time I never bothered playing the game again. (though I did relaunch few times for one of the achievements) The mechanics is simple and yet hard to be very good since there will always be people faster than you. This is not bad overall and I've seen worse games but, I could not find the reason to buy this on my next life regardless of price.\n\nLack of Content\nWhat you see in the screen is what you get. No upgrade, no other game modes. The only thing you can change is the appearance of your character which wouldn't really matter that much as most of the time you'll be focused on the tree and your score. There is a multiplayer which is pretty neat but in the end its exactly the same as singleplayer except your competing with actual humans.\n\nBut, the price is cheap!\nThe price of a game being cheap is not valid for it to suck, to be boring, or to lack content. You might be able to get this for less than a dollar or even free but, games like this should remain to where they originally belong.

On mobile it was free but it is it actually worth purchasing the game?\n\nTimberman is an extremely basic game, but it is highly addictive and fun. All you have to do is chop on the left and right of the right avoiding the incoming branches. You have to try and get as high as possible and so get as high a score as possible. There is a system put into place to stop you going to slow also. A bar slowly runs down the slower you go but goes up if you chop really fast. If this bar reaches zero then you will loose.\n\nThe really reason to purchase this on steam instead of playing on mobile is the new multiplayer mode. It's a lot of fun. You could describe it as a kinda tug of war gamemode. It uses the deteriorating bar from the other mode but with a twist. You both use the same bar. So you have to try and go faster than the other person so you don't loose. This mode isn't on the mobile version and is steam exclusive.\n\nPositivesAddictive gameplay- The gameplay may not be the most unique about, but it sure is fun.\nMultiplayer mode- Insane fun tug of war style mode which isn't on mobile.\nLeaderboards- It integrates steam leaderboards so you can compare your scores in each mode against friends.\nRanking system- Each user is given a rank and skill level based on how good they do.\nGraphics- Beautiful pixel graphics style. Multiple different settings for levels that each look as great as the previous. Alive backgrounds with animations of clouds and birds to keep it looking real.\nCharacter skins- New character skins can be unlocked by getting to certain highscores.NegativesMatchmaking- Matchmaking is sometimes good but is more often than not very slow. It sometimes takes a few tries to actually get into a game. Users aren't kicked when they don't ready up. A few bugs can sometimes leave you stuck on the matchmaking screen making you have to restart the game.\nKeyboard control- No keyboard control in the menus. When your playing the actually game with the keyboard it would be much easier to keep using it rather than having to switch to mouse.\nBug- A bug left an extra character on my screen that was obstructing my view. I had to restart the game to get it to go.\nSounds- I wasn't a fan of any of the sounds or music. I found them to be annoying and not satisfying to go along with the gameplay. I turned them off almost immediately and put on my own music.\nThat's about it for timberman. There is very little content but your playtime will come from repeating the game to try and beat your highscore. I think the multiplayer mode is enough to consider a purchase if you already play the mobile version. For the price of only £0.79 it is well worth it.

Sounds simple right? Too bad that’s only half the truth. When you add online multiplayer, multiple characters, achievements and leader boards, this becomes something of a gem to play.\n\nThe developers are still adding in additional content as I write this review, so you can expect a few extra characters on the way, but I wouldn’t hold my breath for extra game modes though. This game would have been ideal if it had a training mode of sorts which you can adjust the frequency of branches or cool down timer, but I’m nitpicking at this point.\n\nI’ve spent a suitable amount of time playing this online, the connection is stable and there is always a game or two going on. Some people tend to play better than most though, so your mileage may vary, my heart tend to skip a beat when a Japanese turns up in multiplayer.","March 8","true","20.6"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

It's extremely fun chopping wood solo; it's a complete speed and reaction game! Seriously, the best $0.99 I've spent on Steam in a long time!\n\nThe chopping stats achievement unlocks are my favorite! There are over 30 characters to unlock by chopping "X" number of logs. In the last hour I have chopped over 8000 logs unlocking a plethora of characters.\n\nThe best part is multiplayer! There is an active following with this game. I started off as 56k rank and by the end I was 24k and pretty decent, so there is tons of competition.  Basic matches consist of 4 choppers squaring off; the fastest and most accurate chopper wins.\n\nWorth way more than $0.99!\n\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

Basically all you have to do is right/left click on your mouse or use the right/left arrow keys to swap sides. Nothing more, nothing less. You die, you restart. Took me a minute to figure out you had to change sides lol. It's alright for a little while, but, because it's very repetitive, it can become quite boring. Since the cost is cheap, and it has multiplayer and steam cards, it might be interesting to those who like this sort of genre.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/falkryxsfunhouse/recommended/398710/","falkryxsfunhouse","Spiral Jacobs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/falkryxsfunhouse/","51 products in account","Timberman is a 16bit wood chopping mini-game in which you use the arrow keys to both chop take un-human, whopping chunks out of the tree in a single stroke and to dodge the trees deadly branches. It's like Stepmania, but with more beards and flannel - a simple concept that's deceptively addicting.\n\nThere's a nice selection of skins to unlock for your lumberjack via various achievements which are mostly, but not all, chopping related and a speed chopping multiplayer challenge with global rankings. The audio clip that plays each time you chop sort of grates on your ears but there's a handy check box in the options menu to disable it. While you're in there I'd suggest muting the music as well - there's not a lot of variety, and if you're like me you're going to be spending an embarassing amount of time climbing up the ranked ladder.\n\nPros -\n+Addicting. It's mobile app-crack come to Steam =p\n+Skill Numbers and Global Rank give you a sense of progression, despite repeating the same activaty a bajillion times.\n+Variety of skins let's you change it up.

I felt like I was a real lumberjack, it was so vivid that the smell of wood, wood freshly rocketed out of a tree in squares segments going 45 mph never to be seen again (Why are they chopping the wood if not to use it? Is it just a way for gods and mortals alike to relieve stress? Does it matter? All the players want is a mindless game they can click to satiate their crave for some form of immediate satisfaction.), came upon my nose.

When I was younger, at an age where show and tell was a big thing. I was hoping to show everyone what my dad did for a living, and hell I actually had no clue. He'd always leave in the some pair of clothes; a blue beanie, a red checkerboard button up, and blue jeans. He'd go outside everyday and sometimes come back home late. So one day, I went outside to spy on him before the day of show and tell. He broke into nearby a workshop and stole a chainsaw. Go out to the nearest tree, and start cutting it down, yelling out T-TIIIMBER! And that was the day I realized...could my dad be a physcopath? under some stress and releases it through strange illogical behaviour? Heck no! He was a fan of the great game Timberman and wanted to express his love for the darn addictive game! Why are you reading this?

They are the main reasons that this game can be played for hours on end. Ok, so my first impressions were that it was hard but after about half an hour I got a solid tactic and was pretty damn good at the game already! This game is one of those games that you play after a long day at school/work just to let some steam out. With singleplayer and multiplayer, this game keeps you wanting more, keeps you trying to beat a highscore. And that's a really positive aspect of this game. This game is everything that it set out to be, and for that I give it a...\n\n8.5/10\n\nPros:\n-Singleplayer, Local Multiplayer and Online Multiplayer\n-Great sounds\n-Great tchno music\n-Nice Controls\n-Nice community\n-Easy to join online matches\n-Nice Competitive gameplay\n-Fun and addictive\n-Easy to pickup\n\nCons:\n-Dead Hand :P","February 24","true","12.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I AM ONLY STATING HOW I FEEL. DO NOT HATE FOR NO REASON. Timberman Timberman is a game that has once started on mobile, now ported to Steam\n\nThe Game Itself\nThe game is a basic Concept.\nThe game is a game where you are a lumberjack or other kinds of people (I will get to get to that in a moment)\n\nGameplay\nThe Gameplay is simple yet enjoyful. To play the game you have to tap left and right to avoid branches that will kill you while choping down the tree to get a bigger higher score, as well as unlock some other types of cameo's that you can customize yourself with. You could be Jason, to a wrestler, to flappy bird itself. cool and funny but doesn't make any difference to the Gameplay other than appearance\n\nThere are 4 types of controls\n\n- A+D\n- Left and Right Arrows\n- and the controller (LB+RB and Left and Right on the Dpad)\n\nThe Gameplay can also be addicting if you really want to put the effort into this game but your most likely not. In my experience I was bored with it within the first few day of purchasing this game.\n\nMultiplayer\nAnother thing that makes this game pretty cool in my opinion from the mobile port and that is also exclusive to Steam is the Multiplayer Counter part. This may add 30 minutes to 1 hour of extra playtime. You play the usual mode like in single player but you could play against other people online or split screen. there is 2 player, 3 player, and 4 player. And the concept here is that it is the last man standing wins. best out of 3 standings is the true winner.\n\nOverall The game in general is fun to play for the first and second day of purchasing the game, but in honesty unless you have friends that also own this game, can get addicted to games like these but on PC then I recommend you skip or maybe at most avoid this game.","March 18","false","6.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

What I mean by that is it's REALLY fun for a limited amount of time before I start losing interest in it. Any game that I find really fun right off the bat will automatically fit into that category. I guess with that being said, it seems like replay value. Anyone get bored of Rocket League yet? Yeah, its replay value isn't that good.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ness1228/recommended/398710/","Ness1228","Ness1228","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ness1228/","83 products in account","Short review:\nSimple gameplay using 3 buttons\nCan be played with one hand\nRelatively cheap\nCan play as a variety of unexpectedly different characters\nSupports online multiplayer as well as local multiplayerMore words:\n\nThis game is the most excellent time-killing game I've played. Easy to pick up and put down at a moments notice, I often find myself playing it when I'm waiting for something else, only to get immersed into it and just continue playing anyways.\n\nThe gameplay is simple: you use one of many provided button combinations (you can use a keyboard, mouse or controller) to chop either the left or right side of the tree. Keep chopping until a branch hits you (via chopping on the wrong side) or the timer at the top runs out from going too slow (which is a non-issue until your score gets really high).\n\nThe unlockable characters also give motivation to play, and  you can even play as Gaben.\n\nThe passive online mode is a nice touch; the game actively searches for multiplayer lobbies while you play single player. There's an option to turn this off as well should you only wish to play in singleplayer. If you want to play multiplayer only, there's an option for that too; the game will search for an open lobby, and if there isn't one, it'll automatically create a lobby for you.\n\nMy only complaint about the game is the music; the only song is a short chiptune song that speeds up in intensity the more you play, and resets after you die. It's catchy at first and the idea sounds good on paper, but I personally find it rather distracting and annoying after a while. Fortunately, you can turn off the music (and the sound effects if you want) in the options menu and just play your own music instead.\n\nOverall, I think the game's simplicity is its strong suit, which is why it's priced as such. I'd say it's worth it if you find yourself wanting something to kill time while waiting for something else, or if you just have some spare change lying around and want a cheap and simple game, especially if it's on sale.","December 22, 2015","true","8.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The higher the score the more skins you get, the multiplayer is usually filled with hackers or it's buggy, but once it works it's still not that fun and I prefer singleplayer. It's not a perfect game but it's only worth $1, but I would wait untill it goes on sale.","December 12, 2015","true","1.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/abes/recommended/398710/","abes","✪ abes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/abes/","54 products in account","This is one of the most addictive, easy-to-play but hard to master games out there. Although I was not familiar with its predecessor on iOS (apparently that's where it came out first) I couldn't resist the great price, well polished (or Polished? - game devs are from Poland) experience and the appealing sense of simplicity. Seeing the controls help/options page at first was a bit confusing since every button is just CHOP - soon after I realized that the game is really that simple and each CHOP button has a direction (left or right).\n\nUpon attempting to play with a keyboard, mouse and Xbox 360 controller I've settled on my mouse since it allows to click the fastest and it seemed I am already naturally used to LEFT and RIGHT click as two directions unlike keyboard buttons or controller buttons.\n\nThe gameplay is fun and although not many people seem to be indulging in the multiplayer component of it, you can still get some solid chopping in in single player mode.\n\nVariety of unlockable skins/outfits/characters gives the game additional appeal and increases the desire to grind!\n\nHighly recommended! Have fun and add me on Steam if you'd like to 1v1 :-)","November 3, 2015","true","3.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/recommended/398710/","colonsimulator","Hippo Turtle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/","1772 products in account","For the cost (especially if you get it on sale) this game is worth at least trying. Before playing for the first time, I didn't really have an opinion formed even though it's really obvious Timberman is a mobile game. The pixel graphics are nice (at least to me) and the combination of cross-platform online play with fast-playing arcade action made my decision an easy one.\n\nThe gameplay itself is extremely simple. The character being controlled moves left and right avoiding branches as fast as possible while chopping logs from the tree. That's it. That's all there is to the gameplay. This description makes it all sound very boring but if you actually play it, Timberman is good for at least several hours of your time. The game offers both personal and online goals to play towards. In the single player mode, the objective is to chop as many logs as possible and improve your high score as your skill ramps. The multi-player mode has the same high scoring end but against other people online. This could be done one-on-one or against up to three other people. One of the more appealing side-goals as your high scores increase over time is that there are 37 playable characters to unlock. Although, one of the unlockable characters is bugged (Timber Hook) and will not unlock.\n\nBeing good at Timberman is difficult and demands many simultaneous skills and abilities. In order to reach the 2,000 logs chopped Gabe Newell character unlock and for the player to be in the top 500 ranking (or better), this game is surprisingly challenging. A blend of patience, precision, speed, quick reflexes, dexterity, hand-eye coordination and stamina are mandatory to succeed. It's really fun to see your progress through the ranks over time and to beat higher ranking online opponents. With that said, there comes a time Timberman just starts being boring and the excitement and fun of competitive online ranked play stops driving you. The challenging and fast-paced gameplay stops being interesting and you'll feel like moving on to the next game on your list. The game is fun while it lasts. It just doesn't last very long.\n\nTimberman is okay.","May 2","true","16.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I didn't think I would play it much, but here I am 90 minutes later.\n\nThe basic premise of the game is simple- chop as many blocks off a tree and avoid getting hit by branches while going fast enough to maintain the game timer. If you get hit by a branch or go too slow, it's game over. You move back and forth on the tree by pressing left/right, or a/d or whatever you prefer.\n\nThere are 40 characters to unlock through various game goals. Some of the ways to unlock characters revolves around hitting a certain number of tree blocks in one life, or reaching a certain lifetime number of chops. It gives the game some replay value.\n\nMoving on to multiplayer, it's just as simple as single player. You can play two people on one computer, or take it to the internet to battle anyone else looking for a match. I played a variety of matches, and it's basically a best out of 5 match. If you're evenly matched, one battle can take a good minute or more. Most are shorter than that. But if you're too slow (get behind by around 20 chops), you also lose that way too. It's fun, and I liked the competition aspect of multiplayer. You can see each player's rank and skill, which makes it more fun when you beat people ranked higher than you.\n\nOverall, I was surprised how much I was involved in the game. I will probably stick with it for awhile and it was worth it for the price.","September 18, 2015","true","1.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

It's developed by Digital Melody (known for mobile games like Risky Rescue). The goal is very simple and can be in some ways compared to flappy bird. You're a timberman, and your goal is to chop down a tree while avoiding branches. Seems kinda boring, but trust me it's really fun.  So you have to chop as many logs from the tree as possible before either the branches on the tree or the timer kills you. It's not an easy game and takes some time to master. You get better, makes more progress and unlock more stuff. It's very rewarding for all your hard work.\n\nThe game has a singleplayer and a multiplayer. The singleplayer is you alone chopping down the tree, trying to get the best score possible. Because you can unlock a lot of new "timbermen" to play as and unlock achievments based on how many logs you get. It gives the game replayability where you every time get a new goal to reach. The multiplayer is eiterh dual or 4-player where you fight against other players being the fastest timberman. You can defeat the other players by chopping much faster than them to get their time-bar decreased  while dodging branches, or you can hope they hit a branch themself. It has a ranking system based on skill and rank, where skill counts on how good you are on singleplayer and rank counts on how many people you can defeat on multiplayer while climbing the leaderboard.\n\nAt times the multiplayer can get really competitive and exciting. The MM system is a bit unstable and you can lose connection sometimes. Sometimes you match with ppl at rank 20.000 while you are 1.000 which makes it a bit unfair for the low rank player. Also it takes a bit of time before everyone accepts games (drops out etc.) and it can be frustrating. But the devs are good with content updates and bugfixes where they keep on pumping out more content for the player base. A big thumbs up for the good work the devs do.\n\nIt's a cheap game (7kr), and works great as a time consumer. Really good pixel graphics, addicting sound/music, good fps and fun/simple gameplay. Give it a try!","December 31, 2015","true","31.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Press left to chop from the left, press right to chop from the right.  Every chop you make, the tree goes down one block and is endless.  Comes with lots of unlockable characters and a very active multiplayer that continually seeks for games while you're in single player mode.  Game is cheap enough as it is but on sale it's a bargain.\n\nSeriously, this game takes a single simple concept and does it right.  It's the way One Finger Death Punch works.  I absolutely love it, and the multiplayer makes for quick and silly and frustrating games!\n\n","January 1","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Ever wanted to clear a whole forest by yourself?  If you answered yes either of these questions Timberman is the game for you!  Its a super straight-forward, silly game.  One that clearly was designed as a mobile game but had enough charm and appeal to sneak onto steam.\n\nThe goal is simple, cut down as much of these infinitely tall trees as possible.  You can cut from the left or right sides of the tree.  You'll need to move back a forth between the two sides to avoid branches jutting out of the tree.  Chop and dodge quickly for you time is limited.   Every hit will restore some time but the as round progress it becomes harder to keep up.  When the time runs out of you get hit once, you dead!\n\nLearning to find a rhythm is very important for efficient dodging.  Instead of pausing every time a branch comes down you'll already be ready to swiftly move to the side.  Memorizing the patterns of going back and forth, especially for the double hits, is essential for fast dodges.  The added pressure from seeing the timer begin to rapidly decrease certain doesn't help.\n\nIf improving your score isn't enough motivation in itself there are several unlockable characters.  Many can either be made available simply be setting a high-score or just by chopping some much wood over time.  Some characters offer a little more interesting challenges for playing multiplayer matches, earning a certain score consecutively, or chopping so much wood in a particular time frame.  The multiplayer isn't particularly exciting online but this is a hilarious game for split-screen, one that would probably do great at parties or competitive events.\n\nThis game is stupid simple.  You only need two buttons and all you have to do is chop quickly and dodge branches.  Yet there is a little more life beneath the surface.  Training your reflexes takes time and slowly you'll learn to become faster and more precise.  Speed also plays into a cockiness factor.  Its not hard to go fast but the more you push yourself the more easily you'll fail.  As little as there is to this game I feel there is enough to get your worth out it.","February 16","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now's your chance as indie studio Digital Melody has brought the iOS and Android tree chopping sensation Timberman to Steam.\n\nhttp://youtube.com/watch?v=YHOkFAeVCpM\n\nThe premise is almost too simple: press the left arrow on the keyboard to chop left and press the right arrow to chop right. The only real goal is to avoid dying at the hands of branches as you chop to your heart's content.\n\nThere's something almost hypnotic about the fast-paced action as you feverishly press left or right, avoiding branches before they slam into your character's face.\n\nThe single-player will keep you occupied for short bursts with a goal of beating high scores. The real fun is had in the multiplayer. You can either play with a friend split screen on the same computer or with up to three other people online.\n\nThe offline mode is a tug-of-war that ends way too fast. If one player gets too far ahead of the other, it's game over for the laggard. Disappointingly, there is not an option to change how far ahead you have to be in order to win, which means that some matches can end in a matter of a couple seconds.\n\nThe online multiplayer is more interesting, allowing you to face off against strangers or with a friend that you invite to the game. This mode does not have a tug of war element. Instead, it emphasizes survival. The last person standing wins a round with three rounds needed to win a match.\n\nIf you enjoy the prospects of carpal tunnel syndrome, you'll love Timberman. Timberman's simplicity is not only found in the fast-paced gameplay but also in the graphics and sound, which features a single repeating music track. The game reminds me a lot of Flappy Bird and endless runners like Bit.Trip.\n\nFor only a buck you can have the game on Steam. The iOS and Android versions are free but an ad-free version will also cost you only a dollar. It may be worth it for at least a couple hours of mindless casual gameplay.","October 27, 2015","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You basically press left and right to chop on the left/right side of the tree, chopping off a segment each press and trying to avoid branches. While it's essentially played 'at you own pace', there is a bar that raises with each chop, and lowers over time, in the beginning it's easy to keep it filled by chopping faster than it lowers, but as the level progresses, it gets faster and faster, forcing you to chop faster, and eventually messing you up by hitting a branch and losing since you were chopping faster than you can react.\n\nThere's a lot of different characters you can play as. Gameplay is still the same, just a skin change, but still nice. Characters like Indiana Jones, Jason(machete killer), an Native American, Santa, one of his Elves, etc. You get them through various ways. Most of them have 2 conditions, and meeting one unlocks them. First one is 'chop XXX times in one game', and the other is 'have XXXX chops total through all games". This way the skilled can get it quick, and those having a hard time can still get it with effort. But some just require skill, like to unlock Obama, you have to score 600 chops 3 times in a row, and there are a few with 'XXX in X games in a row' condition.\n\nThere's quite a few different control schemes. If you're playing by yourself, you can either use W+D to chop, or the left and right arrow keys. The Space Bar, S key, and both Enter keys are all the "Confirm" button, so once you die, you can press those keys to immediately get back into the game. When you're doing Local Multiplayer, Player 1 uses WSD+Space while Player 2 uses Left/Right+Both Enters(S,Space, and Enters 'Ready' the player).\n\nMultiplayer, both Local and Online, is has 2 players competing at once to see who can chop more, and the person with the most chops wins when one player(even the winner) loses all 3 of there lives. It's a very fun game online and off.\n\nFor anyone looking for a Casual and/or Competitive Arcade game, or just looking for some simple fast pace fun, I definitely recommend this game.","September 20, 2015","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I bought it using money I got from selling those trading card things, so more or less for free.\nIf I had to propose a single complaint it would have to be the lack of an overview of the characters, scrolling back and forth gets kinda tedious. On that note, there is a pretty nice amount of characters to unlock, and playing with their missions in mind makes the game a good bit more engaging. And multiplayer is also pretty awesome in my opinion.\n\nOverall: It's an Euro/a Dollar for potential hours of mindless wood chopping, so if you're into these kinds of simplistic games, there aren't really any excuses not to get it.

Now's your chance as indie studio Digital Melody has brought the iOS and Android tree chopping sensation Timberman to Steam.\n\nhttp://youtube.com/watch?v=YHOkFAeVCpM\n\nThe premise is almost too simple: press the left arrow on the keyboard to chop left and press the right arrow to chop right. The only real goal is to avoid dying at the hands of branches as you chop to your heart's content.\n\nThere's something almost hypnotic about the fast-paced action as you feverishly press left or right, avoiding branches before they slam into your character's face.\n\nThe single-player will keep you occupied for short bursts with a goal of beating high scores. The real fun is had in the multiplayer. You can either play with a friend split screen on the same computer or with up to three other people online.\n\nThe offline mode is a tug-of-war that ends way too fast. If one player gets too far ahead of the other, it's game over for the laggard. Disappointingly, there is not an option to change how far ahead you have to be in order to win, which means that some matches can end in a matter of a couple seconds.\n\nThe online multiplayer is more interesting, allowing you to face off against strangers or with a friend that you invite to the game. This mode does not have a tug of war element. Instead, it emphasizes survival. The last person standing wins a round with three rounds needed to win a match.\n\nIf you enjoy the prospects of carpal tunnel syndrome, you'll love Timberman. Timberman's simplicity is not only found in the fast-paced gameplay but also in the graphics and sound, which features a single repeating music track. The game reminds me a lot of Flappy Bird and endless runners like Bit.Trip.\n\nFor only a buck you can have the game on Steam. The iOS and Android versions are free but an ad-free version will also cost you only a dollar. It may be worth it for at least a couple hours of mindless casual gameplay.","October 27, 2015","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Because you just have to press A/D or Left/Right arrow key or Left/Right mouse button for chopping. That's ALL.\nWhat you say? There's multiplayer?

Io non vi capisco. Ancora una volta questo dimostra che NON bisogna credere nelle recensioni di steam, bisogna sempre provarli in prima persona i giochi. Questo è un gioco veramente stupido e senza senso, potrebbe benissimo essere gratuito su uno dei tanti siti con giochi flash.\nPerchè? Perchè si deve solamente premere A/D o le frecce direzionali o il tasto destro/sinistro del mouse per tagliare la legna. Questo è TUTTO.\nCosa dici? C'è il multiplayer?

Also this game has multiplayer and those with friend split-screen.\n\nNot to mention it’s less than a dollar so if you don’t like the game it’s not a complete waste of money. Like that time you asked your mom/dad for a dollar to play the claw machine so you could try to win a stuffed Fluttershy so could take it back home and do whatever you would do to that stuffed Pegasus.

What surprised me is how engaging this game actually is, despite the incredibly simple premise. The key is that the developer added support for four players simultaneously, which results in some really fun local competition. In single player mode, I don't find this game to be that much fun. Add in a few friends to play with locally and it is a blast. The huge number of lumberjacks that you can unlock is nice, but unfortunately you can only unlock them through single player and not multiplayer matches.","November 9, 2015","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Ever wanted to clear a whole forest by yourself?  If you answered yes either of these questions Timberman is the game for you!  Its a super straight-forward, silly game.  One that clearly was designed as a mobile game but had enough charm and appeal to sneak onto steam.\n\nThe goal is simple, cut down as much of these infinitely tall trees as possible.  You can cut from the left or right sides of the tree.  You'll need to move back a forth between the two sides to avoid branches jutting out of the tree.  Chop and dodge quickly for you time is limited.   Every hit will restore some time but the as round progress it becomes harder to keep up.  When the time runs out of you get hit once, you dead!\n\nLearning to find a rhythm is very important for efficient dodging.  Instead of pausing every time a branch comes down you'll already be ready to swiftly move to the side.  Memorizing the patterns of going back and forth, especially for the double hits, is essential for fast dodges.  The added pressure from seeing the timer begin to rapidly decrease certain doesn't help.\n\nIf improving your score isn't enough motivation in itself there are several unlockable characters.  Many can either be made available simply be setting a high-score or just by chopping some much wood over time.  Some characters offer a little more interesting challenges for playing multiplayer matches, earning a certain score consecutively, or chopping so much wood in a particular time frame.  The multiplayer isn't particularly exciting online but this is a hilarious game for split-screen, one that would probably do great at parties or competitive events.\n\nThis game is stupid simple.  You only need two buttons and all you have to do is chop quickly and dodge branches.  Yet there is a little more life beneath the surface.  Training your reflexes takes time and slowly you'll learn to become faster and more precise.  Speed also plays into a cockiness factor.  Its not hard to go fast but the more you push yourself the more easily you'll fail.  As little as there is to this game I feel there is enough to get your worth out it.","February 16","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
