Evil Indie Games is a literal game description btw) with more difficult challenges.  I died so many times on the first area alone, one at 99% complete -_- Music is really great and fits the psychadelic kinda style of the visuals.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeeJaxOff/recommended/444800/","TeeJaxOff","TeeJax <3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeeJaxOff/","3933 products in account","NO THING is an oddly addictive runner game with a great soundtrack and a brilliant story...if you care to listen close enough\n\nThe idea of NO THING is very simple: you are a simple office clerk with a message you must deliver to the Ice Queen. The gameplay consists of you navigating levels with nothing more than your left and right keys. Though it sounds easy at first, NO THING is anything but.\nYou start on level one which is an easy introduction of what is to come. You must follow the path in front of you turning left and right when needed. There is a voice speaking to you as you play, telling you things, some which make sense and some which don't (not right away anyway) and a rather awesome soundtrack playing. You'll see images whilst you play that'll change depending on what's being said. You should spend your time playing NO THING listening and looking very carefully.\n\nThe levels progressively get harder, not just from level one to level two, but whilst you are actually playing them. Platforms will move, appear and disappear. Graphics will flicker, glitch (intentional) and change colour. Images will change, enlarge, shrink and move through platforms. Everything that happens is there to test your focus and concentration; this is not a game for those who suffer from motion sickness or anything similar. NO THING is all about your perception of things and requires you not only to evaluate your surroundings quickly but to also ignore all of the background distraction. Platforms come in different sizes, some being thin and some wider. There are others which are slanted, some which don't properly connect and some which are slightly off centre. You must be alert at all times whilst playing because even clicking half a second too late could be the difference between winning a level and starting all over again. As you run you gain speed continually though I've not yet worked out if this is linked to the amount of turns you take or how long you've been running for. Your speed can work for you or against you, often being helpful for flying from one platform to others that would have been out of reach at a lower speed, but it also makes things a lot harder as your reaction speed has to increase with it. You can find red blocks in certain places to reduce your speed if things start getting a little out of control.\nFalling from a platform doesn't always mean death though. Many levels weave in and out of each other and are on different heights so if you can react quick enough you can find yourself at another part of the level and just continue running.\nYour paths will grow as you progress in the stage and some of them require you to repeatedly run the same path multiple times before something new opens. Often you'll find this will happen quickly and throw you off guard. You can also take different paths, though they'll all eventually lead to the same place, after all, choice is just an illusion in a totalitarian world.\n\nBut the enjoyment of NO THING doesn't just come from the gameplay itself, what really grips you is the story and the way you experience it. Everything, from the dialogue to the music to the images, it just keeps you wanting to play, to find out more, to reach the end. You'll spend the game trying to work out what's going on in this world, with you, and the voice but slowly you'll piece things together bit by bit.\nI found NO THING to be oddly relaxing. When the gameplay wasn't frustrating because i'd failed so many times, the pressing right and left at the right time combined with the soundtrack was oddly calming. At some points when you find your rhythm the game flows perfectly and the levels are long enough that when they aren't too hard and you know the route you need to take, it just works.\n\nThere are only two negative things I can really find about the game, the first is the lack of some kind of a free runner mode. Given the games intense difficulty it would be enjoyable to have endless (or large) levels to practice on so you don't have to continuously repeat a level you're stuck on until you beat it. This is directly link to my second issue which is the fact that the game can feel repetitive at times if you cannot complete a level. There was one particular part where I was reaching 99% and missing the last turn meaning I had to replay the entire level over and over hearing the same dialogue. Though the voice-over is what makes the game so good, hearing it for the 12th time after doing the same bit of a very long level 12 times is rage-inducing. I think a checkpoint system would help but in the same breath I think it'd take something away from the game. The grinding and repetitiveness is a good mirror of life in a totalitarian regime.\n\nI don't know if it was the intention of NO THING to be a dark mirror of reality but I think it does it perfectly. I've never found a game for $4 that's as addictive as this and I really can't recommend this game enough, the experience has been amazing so far. Though difficult at times, the challenge is worth it. How hard can it be, after all, you are just the simplest office clerk. You have one message and you know what you should do.","April 23","true","13.2"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","13","13","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lady_Dawn/recommended/444800/","Lady_Dawn","Lady Dawn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lady_Dawn/","1305 products in account","I'd like to start this review by saying that I'm not a fan of the runner genre. I find this game to be immensely frustrating, as such, but I gave myself five before coming back to review it.\n\nSo what is NO THING? It's fast-paced, unforgiving, and challenging. It falls into the endless runner genre in which you keep on moving forward until you either crash into something or fall off of the track. It has a good--no *great* soundtrack and an abstract, funky art style.\nIt's also frustrating as all hell. Due to my own failings, of course, so I can't really blame the game for that.\n\n.Premise.\nYou're a messenger of sorts. The simplest office clerk. You're delivering a message to the Queen of Ice. You'll find out more about yourself through the robotic narrator as you run through and complete the stages.\n\n.Gameplay.\nRun. You move forward automatically and it's up to you to turn left or right to avoid death. That's all there is to it. The game tries its best to distract you with on-screen visual interferences (like colour changes and graphical glitching/blurring) and a nonsensical "story" that punctuates moments in your progress with a robotic voice reading a line of text that flashes across the screen.\n\nAs you progress, things get more difficult. The speed of your run increases, and so the precision of your turns will need fine-tuning.\n\nFocus is the name of the game here and if you're easily distracted, you'll fall out of your groove and go plummeting to your death. Once you die, you start the level again from the beginning. Then, you try again and again until, finally, you either finish the stage or hit the escape key and go play something else while you cool off.\n\nYou can use either keyboard or gamepad. Either works just as well.\n\n.Soundtrack.\nSo good. I've only managed to get to the second level in my hour of play, but the first track was synthetic... upbeat... electronic... awesome and the second track was a slower, more mellow synthetic upbeat electronic awesome. I assume each stage has its own individual song that plays throughout the entire run.\n\n.Graphics/ Art Style.\nTrippy to say the least. The face on the game's banner appears throughout the stages, which are always awash in bright, solid colours. If you have a history of epilepsy, please do NOT play this game.\n\n.Longevity.\nThat depends on your skill level. I'm god-awful at this game and it took me about fifteen minutes to get through the first level. The remainder of my time was spent floundering over level two. If you're an expert runner, you probably won't get as much time out of this as the average Joe.\n\n.Bottom line.\nIf you're a fan of the runner genre, this game will be a great addition to your library. If you're on the fence about the genre or are new, you may still get some enjoyment from the soundtrack and surreal atmosphere. Just be warned: patience is a virtue.","April 24","true","0.9"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","17","23","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DrLies/recommended/444800/","DrLies","Surgeon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DrLies/","61 products in account","This is a seemingly very simple game, however I think it goes deeper than that. I actually managed to get past the first two levels and the dialogue was the most interesting thing I have yet to hear. It's like a book that you have to read over and over to really understand the meaning. It's like Moby ♥♥♥♥ (perhaps not AS complex) or As I Lay Dying by William Faulkner. At first it seems like it's all nonsense with seemingly poor sentence structure, awkward phrasing but then you realize it's like that for a reason, and since the arcade style game is actually challenging, it forces you to restart and really listen to what it is saying.\n\n****-SPOILERS-**** sort of...\n\nThe game talks about you, a supposed "simplest office clerk" and the third level especially talks about people in your ear and it tells you to think two times implying (what I think would be) that you think twice before speaking and that you're supposed to listen to what "they" tell you. It does say after all that it is set in a totalitarian regime.\n\nIt gives off an almost "what's the point" sort of feel, as it also talks about you the "simplest office clerk" working 8 hours and sleeping 8 hours watching tv for 8 hours and things of those sorts, a routine that is mundane and what seems pointless. You having an office job that you work for 8 hours for, to bring bread to the table, only to be stuck in routine and do nothing in your spare time but something ordinary such as watching TV.\n\nLife loses its meaning as it also talks about all those pointless interactions with people you have on a daily basis, one line in the game went along the lines of 'they hear you, but they don't really care about you or what you have to say' because to them you're just another "simplest office clerk". Emphasis on "simplest". They could have just said "office clerk" but no, the simplest was added, and I think that was just to put more emphasis on the whole concept that maybe this really all is pointless, working 8 hours a day, and sleeping 8 hours with people telling you what to do in your ear and you having to think twice about what to say because you're in a totaliatrian regime.\n\nANOTHER line that I really found interesting went along the lines of "hoping for happiness" after you do everything that they tell you to do. But I mean really, what happiness can you achieve when all you've done and will ever do is be a simple office clerk. It really (I think) focuses on the mundane aspects of life and puts a big emphasis on the whole "what's the point ordeal" and the repeating and following orders like a machine day after day.\n\nPlay level 3 and you'll get EXACTLY what I'm trying to convey. It's a really fantastic game. It doesn't need to be complex to get its point across, and I love these sorts of games where it really makes you think, yet it's so simple. Like Papers, Please. Maybe I read too much into this, but if you make it to the third level, and really listen to the dialogue, even in level two, you can hopefully see what I'm talking about.\n\nOh, another thing. What helps me pass levels is when you're turning, wait until half of the next platform horizontal to you is past your screen before you press to switch directions. I found it helped me with timing, and gave me a bit of reference as to when to turn.\n\nALL IN ALL, GREAT GAME.\n","April 15","true","1.2"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

One of many, one of 1994. You have one message and you know what you should do."\nWow... Literally, wow. Evil Indie Games debut on Steam, NO THING, seems to come out of nowhere but man, it does a great job in screwing with our minds! Set in a futuristic dystopia in 1994, you are (and repeatedly referred to as) the simplest office clerk tasked with delivering a message to the Queen of Ice. The game, as I would like to call it, is a precision runner where you play in a first person view and there is an ending to each level after achieving the required number of turns, as in directional turns. It sounds easier in words but trust me, it gets hard, like REALLY HARD, as the pace would continuously increase throughout the level and made even worse with tight turns, bumps and jumps in between. Missed a turn or overshoot a jump and BAM, back to the starting line for you! It literally took me 30 minutes just to get pass the first stage!\n\nNO THING consists of 10 levels in total and each of them are told as a story by the narrator. This is one of the best points of the game, the backstory is intriguing and fascinating that will leave you wondering why and what is going on. The monotone narrative accompanied by seriously catchy tunes will get you humming the thing even when you've stopped playing, especially if you're stuck at a level for a while. There are a score system implemented in the game but to be honest, I haven't quite got the whole thing figured out yet.\n\nDespite all the positive points, I guess the biggest flaw that NO THING currently have is the lack of contents. As I've mentioned previously, there's only 10 levels and depending on how good you are playing this type of games, it can be a pretty short experience. Luckily, they're planning to release a free DLC in the near future, titled EVERYTHING, which may be a new mode or a new story arc as a whole (if anyone have more information regarding this, I'd appreciate it if you can share it in the comments section below). Oh, and they're also planning to release the soundtrack DLC. Yay!\n\n\nPROS\nGORGEOUS minimalistic design fitting perfectly to the portrayed dystopia!\nSoundtracks that will literally stuck in your head, whether you like it or not (in a good way, of course). One of the few that I'd seriously consider in purchasing in the future.\nSimple and tight controls that are just nice and true to the minimalistic nature of the game.\nThe game runs great! Performance are stable all around with all the Steam basic functionalities present and functional, except for the lack of Cloud saving.\nGlobal online leaderboard are available for you to keep scores.\nGraphics setting are from the standard Unity launcher. It's not bad but not great either.\nFree content DLC coming soon!\nNEUTRAL\nSometimes the game just feel too hectic for you to enjoy or at least get the sense of what the narrator is trying to say. It'd be great if they can add something like a casual or relax mode just so you can listen to the track and enjoy the narrative. For now, I'd recommend checking out Ryusaki Minoru's & Saint Simon's Transcription Guide after finishing a level just to fully understand what the level is actually about. Spoiler alert, of course.\nCONS\nLack in contents in overall. Only one mode is available at the time of the review and the story mode only consists of 10 levels.\nPressing the Esc button exits the game immediately. It would be so much better if they could provide a confirmation window first because you know, misclicked or rage quit and stuff.\nIn-game option only consists of Sounds and Music toggle and also option to change language to Polish.\n\nTo conclude, NO THING is a solid precision runner game with an interesting setting and fair difficulty curve to boot. I give it a well deserved 4/5! Now, go fourth, Simplest Office Clerk!\nFor those who enjoyed runner games, or futuristic dystopia setting, in general and wouldn't mind a little challenge, I have no problem recommending this title to you guys! At the price tag of $4, this is a steal for this kind of gem.\n\n\n\nFor similar Steamified Reviews and Giveaways, please visit http://www.steamified.com/.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/recommended/444800/","zorder","Zorder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/","2001 products in account","NO THING is at the same time, simple and hard to describe. On its essence it is very simple, it is a first person maze runner in which, as you play, levels get progressively harder and you start moving faster and faster. But on the other hand, it is rather weird in terms of story and overall theme.\n\nGameplay:\n\nIn this game you’ll only be pressing the left and right keys to change the direction of where you’re going, which might sound easy at first, but once you start increasing in speed you’ll find that it requires precise timing to avoid falling off the level, especially on later levels. This makes the game really addicting, even more so if you get stuck on a level, which is perfect for either short minute sessions or hour long sessions, because it has that strong feeling of ”just one more run. Despite the fact that the game is based around just pressing two keys, the levels manage to keep things interesting, wich each successive level changing its setting and the structure of the tracks you’re running on. Some levels are flat but with quick turns, while others have a lot of verticality which allow you to save yourself if you eventually fall off, which you most likely will.\n\nStill, when you get stuck on a level it gets infuriating because you’re constantly going through the same route and hearing the same thing over and over. Nonetheless, it feels amazing when you finally finish a level after so many tries and those last moments are ecstatic.\n\nStory, visuals and sound:\n\nLike I said, storywise it can be rather weird, but it starts as it follows, you’re an office clerk and must deliver a message to the Ice Queen, which I interpret as either your boss or some sort of leader. As you play through each level, that get progressively harder and harder, this voice that sounds like it is coming from an old robot speaker keeps talking to you, telling you things, random things that initially don’t make that much sense but as you die and have to repeat the level and listen to it again, some sort of idea starts growing on your head. I also think that this is here to try to get your attention out of the game, because it is kind of hard to pay attention to what is being said and to the game itself, especially when you start moving really fast.\n\nOne thing that needs to be mentioned is the fact that the music in this game is bloody great. The music, the stylish visuals, the chiptune sound effects and the setting all together make the game feel extremely retro and futuristic, at the same time.\n\nThe only complaint that I have about the game are the quick changing bright colors that can induce some slight headaches. I do really like the fact that the levels themselves become somewhat distorted, with some sort of graphical glitch.\n\nFinal verdict:Stylish visuals\nMindblowing good soundtrack\nAddictive gameplay - just one more run\nBizarre and intriguing settingOverall, NO THING is freaking amazing and I must say I’m really surprised by how much it grabbed me. It starts out slow and quickly becomes fast and doesn’t give you a moment to rest. It is very easy to pick up and play, but it is extremely hard to master. I recommend it to anyone who is looking for an unique take on the runner genre.","April 25","true","6.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

The gameplay and graphics also heavily complement the story: the colourful overlays switching, changing graphics and tight, difficult gameplay really give the feeling of being lost, confused and tense, matching the story of isolation and alienation. The story is very difficult to follow since if you pay attention to it you'll most likely die. However this again adds to the atmosphere of confusion and alienation. Additionally the difficulty of the game allows the story to be easier to follow: as you play and die (a lot) you hear the same narration again and again, slowly picking it up in an almost subliminal manner which also helps to add to the bizarre, confused sensation the game gives you.\nAbsolutely incredible game, great, tight, difficult gameplay, great simplistic, poppy soundtrack, the graphics, though extremely simple really do an excellent job for the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/parasought/recommended/444800/","parasought","parasight","http://steamcommunity.com/id/parasought/","188 products in account","NO THING has taught me several life lessons to simplify my ways of living.\n\nSome of the most memorable would be that the neighbors are eating dinner, also they happen to be watching TV, and I could not possibly forget the fact that I have also been taught about their relative location, specifically, that they are located behind the walls and doors.\n\nJokes aside, this game is a runner genre game, if that is a genre, never heard about it before I laid eyes on this game, it had me interested in it ever since I saw the cover picture in the store. At first I thought that somebody made a vaporwave meme come to life in the form of a game. I was baffled by the fact that the only gameplay is just switching directions by 90 degrees to the right or left and as I would soon learn, having to go a full 360 degrees to save yourself from the endless void underneath the pathways you navigate that make up the levels. The trailer had me hooked, the game is one of a kind if there aren't any other like it, which had me thinking about spending money on it.\n\nSo I did.\n\nAnd I got what I wanted.\n\nThis is as simple as an indie about a simple office clerk gets, don't buy the game if you're not looking for uniqueness, it isn't even expensive, so I wouldn't say it's a waste of money if you don't like the game.\n\nNot much to say about the plot as there's not much of a lead to catch onto, but you can make up your own ideas about what's happening in the game. The game has a pretty addicting soundtrack and it blends with the gameplay very well, the increasing speed as you turn makes it even better, in my opinion, all of that makes this game have a good replay value and a drawback effect, I just can't get enough of it. I've also found some exploits (level 3, turn slightly before the turned pathway and get stuck in the corner, press left/right repeatedly for a speed increase and point farming, if you want to place high in the leaderboards) and minor bugs (level 7 had me do some experimenting at the spawn point and I somehow had the character go diagonally, not straight, but this doesn't happen until you die repeatedly and respawn extremely quick, also can make you turn with little delay)\n\nThe soundtrack is stunningly amazing, can't wait for the DLC, will gladly pay for it, and would be even more glad to do so if the songs weren't simple loops ripped from the game, but I'll be happy with either.\n\nI wonder what message the clerk was supposed to deliver though, probably a safety railing suggestion for every pathway.","May 11","true","14.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zazzzel/recommended/444800/","zazzzel","陳先生","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zazzzel/","287 products in account","“the year is 1994\nand it is the future\nmade for everybody\nby the queen of ice”\n\nOverview\nNO THING is a minimalistic surreal action game set in a future ruled in a totalitarian regime.  You play as an office clerk who is sent on a mission to deliver an important message to the Ice Queen.  The game progresses through a third-person omniscient narration which dictates the story as you make your way through the labyrinth.\n\nThe Good\nTaking the form of classic runner games, NO THING is played with only the left and right arrow keys to dictate the direction your character will move.  As you make more turns, the speed at which your character moves also increases.  It is import to note that on every level, you must turn a certain amount of times in order to progress the narrative to 100%.  However you must also run through the map at least once to progress to the next level.  There are certain orbs you can pick-up that will decrease your speed but on each level they can only be collected once.\n\nWith such a simple game design, the driving point of the game is the story.  As you progress throughout the game, you can easily see where the developers pulled inspiration from;  1984,  Catch-22  just to name a few.  The third-person narration plays the role of ‘big brother’ extremely well by utilizing the structure of the leveling system to reveal information about the player and what they should be doing.  Players familiar with the thought process of Winston in  1984  will quickly realize the similarities in the perception and sentence structure of the narration in NO THING as the game progresses.\n\nAfter about 2-3 hours, you will realize the brilliance in combining a runner game and a heavy plot, specifically one related to totalitarianism.  The simple and addictive gameplay hooks you in as a player and enslaves you into “delivering the message to the Ice Queen”.  The narrative voice is quite hypnotic, and will pull the player deeper into the game while the soundtrack will keep you wired, numb and autonomous, functioning similarly to slave songs.  You will effectively be fully immersed into roleplaying as the office clerk.\n\nThe Bad\nThe game is rage-inducing if you have poor reaction times.  In order to progress the story, you must be able to clear a level completely, or else you’ll be stuck in a loop; listening to the same lines again and again.  Repetition is good for keeping player attention, but too long and you will eventually break out the trance and just become frustrated with the game.  Often times, you may feel that the game is just ridiculously unfair and just quit because there is no other way to get around a level.\n\nOverall Score\nI personally rate this game 7/10 for the thought-provoking storyline and great music.  Had the core gameplay included checkpoints and had been less difficult at the higher levels, the game would have been a solid 9/10.\n\nFor similar Steamified Reviews and Giveaways please visit  Steamified [www.steamified.com].

NO THING is honestly one of the best products you can get for under 5$, it has an interesting background story that is told while you're playing the game, really awesome simplistic graphics mixed with some retro elements, really unique and the soundtrack, well, I wish I could buy the soundtrack as a DLC since it's really, really good. The game itself is very chanllenging, it has 12 levels that get harder and harder, most people including me might consider them quite hard. As the description says, the game is telling the story of an offic clerk who has to deliver a letter to the Queen of Ice and trust me, it's a doing a really good job.\n\nTL;DR : Prons and Cons + my final verdict	Pros	Cons	+ Really good price.\n\n+ Really awesome simplistic graphics mixed with some retro elements.\n\n+ Fantastic soundtrack, wish I could buy it as a DLC too.\n\n+ Interesting background story that is told while you're playing the game.	 -  The game seizures and there's no warning that they can easily harm people that suffer from disorders such as Epilepsy.\nFinal verdict: 9.5/10 NO THING is a gem for it's price.

All those words in my head. I feel I am that office clerk. This is a fantastic and challenging maze runner with a touch of a platformer game. NO THING is also an addictive game, maybe one of the most addictive games aI ever played in years. Difficult and you need to be fast minded or you loose. I do not recommend to play it if you suffer headaches. Those changing and blowing neon colors, fast, fast,fast!\n\nWhat did I love from No Thing? The background story of the game. But also, the shining colors, the music, the art. I loved the art, is just amazing. Minimalistic, with a touch of a not so retro future. I think every decade has a different concept of the future. The game is placed in 1994, and the future is so minimal, so colorful and so monotone at the same time.\n\nTotalitarian regime? Maybe sounds like 1894. What do you think? Just follow the story.\n\nI can't forget the music, the music is an electronic constant in my head right now, a retro techno of the 80's. Great for the art concept in general. This is more than a platformer game, really, more than that.\n\nNo Thing is a quite a conceptual game, one of few ones. Actually, I don't remember the last time I played a game like this one.\n\nThe gameplay is simple: use right and left keys to navigate and run. Deliver the message, discover the story behind.

Your character runs forward non stop and you move them left or right to avoid obstacles and death. I've always had a guilty pleasure for these games as they kill some time and can feel very rewarding when you finish a level after failing at it so many times.\n\nThis is what NO THING is but has a interesting concept behind it. You play as a office clerk who is delivering messages to people. As you run about the place, a robotic voice talks to you about a lot of different things such as Totalitarianism and Mundanity of everyday life. This is annoying in its own way though as you have to restart the level from the beginning    if you die, meaning you have to listen to the same piece of dialogue over and over again.\n\nAfter a couple of levels, this game does start to become a little bit boring. You end up finishing a level out of determination rather than enjoyment. The graphic glitches and colours that they throw at you can make it hard to concentrate which adds extra challenge but could also cause quite a headache.\n\nI would still recommend this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gantenbein/recommended/444800/","gantenbein","Gantenbein","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gantenbein/","72 products in account","No Thing is a weird blend of the traditional infinite runner genre, vaporwave aesthetic, the slight nausea of big airtime akin to a surfing mod in an FPS game, and visual disorientation. For a game with only two buttons it is surprisingly deep, both in execution potential and theorycrafting optimal routes; should I take this cube now? Next lap? Never? Players can tailor their choices to match their skill levels and try to complete this surprisingly difficult game.\n\nWhat's also exciting about No Thing is the speedrunning possibilities. Given the technically optional nature of many of the blocks, the varying level completion requirements, and the opportunities to deviate from the intended course, you have a lot of unique ways for players to approach the challenges and try to finish the game as fast as possible. It's also a punishing game for a speedrunner; dying late on a level like 7 or 10 will set you back multiple minutes, meaning that there will be fairly big gaps between runs with 0 deaths and those with even a single death.\n\nI would recommend this to most people who enjoy a unique challenge in their games. Level 7, for example, reminded me of the frustration I experienced in trying to complete Veni Vidi Vici in VVVVVV for the first time. The game lacks in depth of gameplay elements so if you're looking for something with a conceptually broad scope then you'd best look elsewhere. Additionally, while streaming the game I had a viewer experience some mild motion sickness. If you're prone to a motion sickness response from games, stay away.\n\nOverall, this game is super satisfying and I definitely got more than my money's worth with the cheap price point. I plan to stream more of this game, and now that I've completed a run I'll be attempting speedruns of it as well. I encourage others to challenge themselves to do the same.","April 11","true","15.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The game is quite mean with checkpoints but that works well because you really have to master the level to complete it. Despite this, the game never feels unfair or cheap and always gives you a fair chance, you can correct your course if you turn at the wrong time a lot of the time. And sometimes you can land somewhere earlier in the level, even though its hard to pull off.\n\nI would recommend this to everyone, since its quite simple but very well made, the level design is great too!","April 9","true","5.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

All you have to do is reach the end of the level by turning left and right, and after each couple of turns you speed up a littlel. However, as soon as you beat the first level the game opens up and gains verticality. This adds a new layer to the game because, if you time your turns and jumps right, you can actually skip entire parts of a level. Also, levels become far less straight forward, and much more like big mazes for you to run around in, and get confusing with multiple ways for you to go, some of which lead to death. It's a simple, yet fun and challenging experience.\n\nVisually the game looks, in the lack of a better word, trippy. Simple polygons with some psychedelic images floating around , with the screen changing color every couple of turns, and sometimes the screen will start looking "buggy", making it harder to see the way you're supposed to go.\nThe music is fantastic, I died a few times because I got lost in the music and accidentaly turned to the beat.\n\nThere is a story. And as the store page says, it is weird. It is presented by short lines a voiceover speaks every once in a while. And it is hard to follow, because if I try to focus on the narration, I usually die. Can't say much about it now.\n\nAll in all, a very simple, but again, very fun and challenging experience, once you can easily get lost in.","April 7","true","1.9"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

(You have to tolerate repetition, enjoy vague sad stories, and be resistant to motion sickness.)\nFirst off, it's very inexpensive.\nIf you like cryptic surreal media like OFF, Yume Nikki or Twin Peaks, you will feel at home here.\nThe narration is depressing, evocative and mysterious. The narrator talks about isolation and tedium and occasionally gives away bits and pieces about your role in the world.\nThe main sources of difficulty are long levels and the unintuitive camera perspective. Once you get used to it, it's still very fun. The gameplay is reflex-based and feels kind of like Super Hexagon.\nThe level design gets hostile, arguably downright cheap from level 4 on, with trial&error and leaps of faith.","April 18","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay is accentuated by a steady IV drip of bizarre narration.  While I could see some finding it pretentious, it rang as poetic kept excitement levels high.

Even failure feels pretty good, due to the quality sounds and graphics.\n\nThe levels are also crafted well, creating memorable moments of tension - some of which being when you choose poorly.\n\nNO THING is definitely worth the low price tag if you're a fan of its genres.
