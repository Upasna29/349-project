Here is a quick review for the game:\n\nCharacters--9/10:  In games you play, you always have at least one character that you hate or think is poorly written.  However, in Elements, I liked all the characters and could symphatized with almost all characters and cared about what happened in their past.  In addition, I believe that how the story incorporate each character into the story was well done.\n\nMusic--8/10:  The music in Elements is pretty solid.  There are some memorable pieces in the game and I do like the Battle theme and boss music theme.\n\nGraphics--9/10:  I loved the graphics of Elements.  I especially liked the full portraits of the characters during battle.\n\nStory--10/10:  The main highlight of Elements is its story.  While I will not spoil the story, I will say that the story will put you on rollarcoster of emotions.  Since you will most likely get attach to most of the characters in the game (since their characterization is done very well), some scenes in the game will hit you very hard.  Furthermore, the game does an excellent job in building the world and the conflict that surrounds the game.  In addition, the way story is written allows the player to see how each character grows as a person as the game progresses.\n\nOverall, I would give this game a 9/10.  I enjoyed it very much especially the characters and story.  Do not let the fact that it was made in RPG Maker deter you from this game.  It is a very well made game and I would highly recommend it to anyone.","January 13, 2015","true","9.9"," 33 of 47 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","33","47","3","0"

It has some interesting ways to utilize RPG Maker that I haven't see before and for a time immersed me into the world.   The game itself is hard, but not unfair unless you don't know the boss's weaknesses.\n\nIf you are hardcore into these type of RPG games, it might be worth a play through.  I found the story good but the writing ruins the emotional impact by being too stilted to keep my interest.   Since this is the primary reason to play RPG Maker games, I cannot recommend it.","March 13, 2015","false","1.6"," 23 of 37 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","23","37","0","2"

In it, you play as the main protagonist, a 17 years old teenager who's name you get to pick. Your father, a very old man, is one day assassinated by a rival Emperor shrouded in mystery, but before dying he assigns you and your sister the elaborate task of saving the world by mastering and uniting the element bearers.\n\nYou start off with two party members-- you and your sister, Leah, respectively controlling the Fire and Earth elements. From there, you set off on a long journey to find allies to aid you in your grand quest. Your characters automatically level up, which I found to be somewhat negative since you can't assign points, but you can't expect TOO much from a RPG maker-based game. Another negative aspect of this game so far, and an unforgivable one, is the lack of information about enemy stats. Sure, you can identify the type of enemy and logically speaking their weaknesses (per instance, snow monsters are really vulnerable to fire attacks), but at no point do you get to see their HP, level or anything of the sort. The only information you get of them is their name, and some lore explanations as to where they came from.\n\nThe lore itself is looking very promising. I've only played this game for 2 hours so far but I already feel deeply involved in it. As you progress, you gain more party members and special abilities that always come handy in some way, be they passive (such as party stats boosts, defense boost to a party member) or active (fire spells, hailing rocks, confusing enemies, etc etc)\n\nOne could say a big downside of this game is its art. As said in an earlier review, most of this game's art was hand-drawn and looks far from professional. It takes a bit to get used to it, and its dark color palette can sometimes get a bit obnoxious, but it ends up coming off as a somewhat cute art style. The enemies are easily identified by their sprites, I always knew what I was getting into.\n\nAnother positive aspect of this game is that fights aren't shoved down your throat. You can choose to simply explore large areas of the game without getting rolled by gargantuan foes or grind exp and gp to your leisure. One thing that bothers me a bit is that you can't exit a fight to the main title, so you need to quit the game and launch it again if you get stuck in an early boss battle per instance. (early as in your level isn't high enough)\nHowever, another positive aspect of boss battles is that while they can get a bit hard and repetitive if you're low-leveled, they are VERY rewarding. I won't spoil this game's lore and universe, it's so enjoyable it'd be a sin for me to do so.\n\nOverall pros:\n\n• Charming lore, universe and story\n• Characters have their personal traits and fit their elements\n• Calm, soothing soundtrack fitting the game's universe\n• Overall very enjoyable and immersive\n\nOverall cons:\n\n• No level scaling, enemies will always remain the same level which can make things a bit repetitive\n• Lack of displaying enemy stats\n• Boss fights are very punishing if you don't grind\n\nI recommend this game to whoever's looking to play a story-driven RPG. Sure, the art's a bit weird, but it's definitely worth a shot.\n","September 7, 2015","true","12.8"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

Rather than using the typical sprites you probably see in several other rpg maker games, it uses hand-drawn art for battle, and I do like this... ... however the art looks like it was done with little to no effort.  Heck, to me one of the characters you get as of the second battle looks like a zombie.\n\nAlso the hero is at least 17 years of age, and yet I can't help but feel that his lines were made by a 12 year old often tormented by an older brother.  Evidence includes one of the very first thoughts of the morning involve tormenting the little sister, and occasional reference to a "tickle monster".  The other characters I don't mind so much, but hopefully once the party leaves their home town the hero will start acting more mature.\n\nOne more thing that now that I realized, what almost feels like it's missing from this game is a little notice that you leveled up.  It's not a big deal, but just something to let me know I leveled up other than showing new skills next time I go to use a skill (I may or may not notice when I go to the menu beforehand)\n(Just now realized after paying attention to my "next xp" and mathing when I leveled up, there is a notification, but all that happens is your character's status changes from "[normal]" to "level up" on the battle screen so you almost have to look for it every time)\n\nA redeeming factor that I forgot to mention is that instead of using a random battle system, enemies show up outside battle so you may avoid them.  Also their sprite outside battle hints at what type of battle it may be.\n\nI will give credit to the devs though, as they have provided something of a free guide, though it's hard for some people to read it as some of the guide was made on a spreadsheet rather than putting it in pdf format.  (I'm using open office, but I can't help but wonder if it would look different in microsoft excel)","June 7, 2015","false","4.7"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","10","16","0","0"

RPG Maker games tend to get a bad rap, mostly for their low quality and lack of original resources. But this game suffers from none of these problems.\n\nThe sprites and tilesets are reminiscent of the old Final Fantasy games. And the art and monsters, (Though seeming drawn on MS Paint) are really colourful and well made.\n\nThe music too is all original and quite catchy.\n\nThe game play although at most times is very typical of RPG Maker, there are a few times the game uses it in ways I haven't seen before.\n\nThe game suffers a little in the dialogue at times, but overall the story is very enjoyable.\n\nYou can tell a lot of heart went into the making of this game, and I love that I get to play something I can tell someone else really loved making. It reminds me of the “game” I always wanted to make when I first got my copy of RPG Maker 2000 back in the day. All in all I really enjoyed this game, and I recommend it to anyone looking for a good old RPG!","March 2","true","7.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

If you're a game snob, or any kind of snob, there is a good chance you will hate this, but you will be missing out.  A lot of people are turned off by RPG maker games or games that aren't bright and shiny.  I've judged based on appearance myself but something about this game intrigued me so I bought it. I'm really glad I did.  It has an insanely original feel.  If you can get over superficialities and are a hardcore fan of RPG's, please give this dude your money.  It feels like the etsy of video games to me.  It's incredibly obvious to me that there was a lot of work and heart put into this game.  The story is true to to the feel of old school RPG's but feels fresh. The music seems to be written and recorded personally.  I'm pretty stoked to hear guitar as opposed to your everyday digital video game music. The art done for the battle scenes scream originality and although it's odd at first to see something like that in an RPG, it's quickly endearing and if i'm being honest, pretty effing adorable.  I'm truly excited to get deeper into the story and discover what's in store. Kudos to the developer. Seriously. Some may speak down on it for seeming crude or using RPG maker.  Don't listen to them.  Not everybody is a coding genius.  This guy took what he had and put all of it and more into a labor of love that seeps originality into a genre that can be quite repetitive and tired. Again, give this dude your money.","January 18, 2015","true","0.8"," 13 of 28 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","13","28","0","2"
