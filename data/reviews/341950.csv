"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deidaraakatski/recommended/341950/","deidaraakatski","Mrepitome","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deidaraakatski/","282 products in account","Decided to delete and rewrite my review since Lux Delux has roughly about 73% of Steam users who have purchased it gave it an upvote, meaning, the remaining 27% downvoted the game. First off, I went and read all the negative reviews, sure there are graphical glitches I'll give them that. However, the claims: there is other games better; its terrible; not worth it; a rip-off; free flash game; are in my opinion false claims. First off, there are only two other Risk type games on Steam besides Lux Delux. One of them is by Hasbro and is just called Risk and uses the standard Risk board without any online multplayer support except for hotseat. Then there is Risk: Factions by EA which does have online multiplayer but is otherwise buggy and playing the original Risk isn't all too intuitive as it uses assets from the factions part of the game breaking the immersion. Not to mention the constant multiplayer crashes and disconnects. Then there is Lux Delux which features 900+ maps and online support and two additional game modes. Again, yes occassional there is a graphical glitch, but the game is created in a 2-D flash-esc style. It's mostly composed of decals, which fits the game perfectly very much like Risk by Hasbro. Not only that, but the game doesn't crash and is very easy to get into.\n\nAlthough, to be fair there is not a proper tutorial except for a small guide in the options menu giving you a quick idea how to play the game. What I am trying to say is Lux Delux is more for players who have played Risk before. If I may add one complaint, it would be that you cannot see the dice rolls. In better terms, two dice are rolled if you are defending and three dice are rolled if you are attacking with an army with more than three troops in it. Of course, a die has dots representing numbers 1-6. However, these numbers happen in Lux Delux instantanously. Basically, you don't get to see the roll all you see is an explosion of colours and the outcome of the attack or defence. You'll know if you conquored/defended the territory if your forces are still there. I believe the idea behind Lux Delux was to make Risk feel very fast paced and more than likely designed for expert Risk players who do not care to see what the roll was. To be honest, it really doesn't matter the roll is, its all probability, whenever you are attacking you risk losing all of your troops anyways to a bad roll. However, seeing the outcome of the dice roll gave the Risk game a certain asthetic that I think a lot of players like me enjoyed seeing. If the dice roll was visible it would also help out new players tremendously understand the game. If you don't understand Risk you can always google or leave a question on my profile's comment section.\n\nTo conclude this review, I believe its the best Risk game available on Steam, as mentioned invisible dice rolls does take away a little away from the asthetic traditional feeling of Risk, but Lux Delux makes up for it with its 900+ selection of maps and additional game modes. Fair warning though, if you aren't into decal/2-d style graphics then stay away from the game, but don't punish it with a bad review because you didn't like the way it looks. In a way its sort of like a Wargame, it's meant to have a paper-like/boardgame look to it.","December 13, 2015","true","12.4"," 65 of 72 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","65","72","4","7"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/strategikal/recommended/341950/","strategikal","Strategikal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/strategikal/","1935 products in account","Lux Delux is a Risk style game, similar in many ways to the original but with several extra features. Although the game mechanics are very simple, the strategy is often quite challenging.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/DTupYOTo90Q\nProbably the most outstanding feature of this game is that there are over 900 maps available, providing endless variety in the gameplay. Most of these are created by users so the quality varies widely, but there are more than enough good maps to keep you occupied.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/vkfetLs8z0g\nAnother great feature is the AI, which is really well programmed. There's around a dozen bots of different difficulty levels, each of which has a different playstyle. The hard bots are REALLY tough to beat! Additionally there's multiplayer so there's plenty of humans to go up against.\n\nGraphics are pretty basic, but they're perfectly functional for this kind of game. Many of the maps are really well designed.\n\nIt's a fairly quick game to play, although it can take longer on some bigger maps or against tougher opponents, so it's great for when you have 10 or 20 minutes to spare.\n\nI recommend this for anyone who craves a quick strategy fix but doesn't have enough time for a full game of Civ 5 or Hearts of Iron 3!","May 1, 2015","true","15.3"," 74 of 89 people (83%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","83","74","89","5","4"

In Lux Delux you take control of a faction (what faction that is depends on the map) and your goal is to take complete control of the map you're playing on. The risk elements of Lux mean that a game can turn on its head in a single turn and this, combined with excellent AI, means you'll always get a unique experience even if you play the same map with the same AI.\n\n+Basic graphics that suit the game well\n+All of the maps are well designed\n+Simple controls but tricky strategies give the game very addictive gameplay\n+Over 900 maps, yes you read that correctly, 900!\n+Depending on what map you play the game can be over in a matter of minutes so it's perfect if you just need something to play quickly\n+Three different levels of bot difficulty, each with sub-levels of difficulty which change the way the AI behave, for example a defensive AI will only defend their territory\n+A lot of maps have a unique mechanic and these can sometimes be a little confusing to begin with but also make each map unique\n+Great soundtrack\n+Excellent AI and Map creator/very easy to mod\n+Very friendly dev who is active on the forum\n\n-The Steam Overlay causes lots of graphical glitches with the game which make it unplayable so you have to play with Steam Overlay turned off\n-It isn't very beginner friendly and the official guides aren't overly helpful, I had to have a friend explain to me how to play\n\nVerdict:\n9\n\nA fantastic, fast-paced, risk style TBS game with fitting graphics, a massive amount of maps, fantastic AI and some interesting mechanics. If you're a fan of risk games or just want a more compact version of Civ 5 then this is an absolute must buy.\n\n***This review was written using a key provided by the Developer for review purposes***\n\nEl K.","May 5, 2015","true","3.5"," 79 of 101 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","79","101","2","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MartyrA2J/recommended/341950/","MartyrA2J","MartyrA2J","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MartyrA2J/","557 products in account","Reviewing Lux Delux is like reviewing Candy Land, these are games that are far older then I am and will be around long after I am gone and buried. Essentially when you break down Lux Delux, it's Risk with multiple levels and online player support. I could end the review here and call it a day however, there are some things that this game does right and does wrong. So as we move forward with this review, keep in mind that if you love Risk, you're going to love Lux Delux. I can't really say anything negative about a board game that has been around since 1959. Lux does capture the spirit and fun of its inspiration.\n\nOn the other hand it does have some issues, ranging from graphical to interface. When you first load up the game, the first thing that greets you is a very complicated looking menu.\nThis isn't the most friendly of sights at first glance. This looks like something out of the Windows 95 era. One could say there is a plethora of options, in that regard, that is very true. There are menus upon sub menus that let you tweak, twerk, twist and twiddle all of the rules and many other options that I could list here for quite a while. Needless to say if you're the type person who enjoys an extreme amount of customization, it's all there for you. The only problem is that this menu kinda sucks for lack of a better term. It's not very user friendly. Not only that, it completely fails in its Steam integration. If you load the Steam overlay, it completely over laps and messes up the entire appearance of the menu.\n\nAt the heart of the problem with Lux is that it doesn't work very well with Steam. Graphical issues abound inside the menu and in game as well. I had my game corrupted in the middle of play many times as the graphics just wigged out for no reason. This required me to save, reload the program, and continue playing. The current fix for it is to simply turn off the Steam overlay, which does work,  That doesn't excuse things like menu buttons not working properly and other weird issues that this program seems to have.\n\nNow at the end of the day, do these issues really technically matter? No. Your playing this game cause you love Risk/Lux and want to play the 900 levels that are possibly at your fingertips. For all you strategy lovers out there, there are more maps then you can shake a stick at and more readily available for download, if you get tired of the basic ones. The levels range in designs, some of them are nice, others are clunky. There is still plenty for you to chew on and eventually find the one that you like. You can even create your own levels, if you have the patience for it.\n\nSo lets talk about the meat of the gameplay. The options of varying AI are quite abundant and seemed very well versed on how to kick your strategic bee-hind. I found myself several times struggling to maintain a border as the enemy smashed against my troops over and over again. I noticed though that sometimes the AI tends to work together against me.  This could be paranoia talking, it just seemed like one enemy would weaken me up and then the next would just smash through me. This particular AI strategy happened many, many times. I did not falter though and I did win the basic map after a while. Matches against the AI can last anywhere from 10 to 40 minutes. I still feel like there is plenty of matches left for the AI and I am scared to find out how the game behaves on hard.\n\nWhich brings me to Online multiplayer. This is a bit of sore area for me. You would think attaching itself to Steam it would take advantage of the platform in bringing players together. This isn't the case sadly, I only ever saw 8 or more players online at any given time. Port forwarding was another issue that I had heard about but thankfully was spared. I feel like if Lux did a little bit better with integrating itself with Steam, more players might be playing the game. Of course, that's speculation. As it stands Lux feels like a 3rd party program that you can buy on Steam. Instead of a game ON Steam.\n\nThe audio element of Lux is fine for what it is, simple and explosion filled. Music is fairly well done and varied amongst the maps. I only occasionally ran into songs that played on other maps. The tunes are jaunty and have a nice pace to them. The game offers bucket loads of replayability either through the AI or perhaps convincing a group of friends to meet up at a certain time. I should also mention the game does feature two extra expansions, American History and Ancient Empires. What these expansions boil down to is just extra maps, nothing that changes the rules or adds any other features.\n\nAs I said at the beginning, anyone who loves Risk is going to enjoy Lux. You are guaranteed to find some interesting maps, and if you're lucky, interesting players. Just don't come into Lux expecting anything ground breaking. This is what it is, and it works, however I do feel maybe some extra rule bending would've added some fun game modes. As to the games issues, the graphical issues will eventually be patched out hopefully; the menus are rather ugly but you grow accustomed to it. If you're not convinced you will enjoy Lux, keep in mind that the actual board game of Risk is going to run you $25 usually. This seems easier, cheaper, and gives plenty of bang for its buck.","July 6, 2015","true","1.8"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","21","27","3","0"

The strategies that you can utililze, the maps and unique situations and risks you have to take, and the satisfaction of a hard win makes this game one of my favorites of all time.  One of my favorite features it that you can also make your own maps from scratch, which I've started to do more and more of, further enhancing the capabilities of this game.\n\nWhile not as polished as some titles in other genres that I'm used to, this does not detract from this amazing game and I have loved seeing this game become better and better over time as other people have loved it as well.\n\nThe only complaint I can even put in this review is that this game's brother Castle Vox/Lux Alliance is not also on Steam, because that is also another spectacular game with many similarities to Lux Delux.  Hope to see this soon!!\n\nLux Delux is a perfect single player game that you can have any experience that you would like to have with as far as strategy goes.  I would personally highly recommend this game and this developer, who has helped me to get my copy onto Steam and has been amazing for liscencing throughout my entire experience with them.

It IS a RISK-type board game, but with such a fantastic wide variety of maps it really changes the strategy per map, especially when you get maps that are both sea and land based.  And there are just tons of options for AI behavior and skill level, and tons of community maps not to mention the multiplayer online games you can do.  I really like the idea of a few large cities across the map that also worth a bonus army or two; changes up the strategy.  Very cool.\n\nThe ONLY downside on the main game itself is that I really wish it had a "campaign" as the two DLCs do.  The DLCs give you the feeling of accomplishing a story or going through history, even if it is just a board game.  So I HIGHLY recommend the two DLCs:  American History Lux and Ancient Empires Lux.   Both, though dated, I liked even better than the core game maps, again due to the campaign nature of the DLCs.\n\n(Oh, I forgot to mention, the game does occassionally have graphic glitches -- I hit ALT-TAB a couple times and the screen is back.  It didn't bother me but thought I'd pass it along.)\n\nOK. One last minor, minor gripe.  The Steam Achievements for me did not work at all.  I didn't even get the achievement for winning a single game despite finishing the 2 DLCs, all 11 included maps, and a couple downloaded maps.\n\nThe 11 maps included in the Core Game are all certainly good, but they are unrelated to each other.  Included there's a Castle Siege, a couple European maps, a USA map, a WW II map, a Pacific Theater map, and the Classic RISK map, but then you get some novelty maps too:  a Solar System map and a Silicon Valley map.\n\nBut along with the Core Game, there are many, many good maps that you can download (right from the main menu) or even make maps yourself.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Seranth/recommended/341950/","Seranth","Seranth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Seranth/","1189 products in account","Lux Delux is a Java-based implementation of the Risk board game. It comes with 11 maps by default (though you're free to download more) and there's a bit of variety to them (some maps have regions without bonuses, regions with one-way access, regions separated by single chokepoints, etc.). There are a good amount of options to customize the game rules.\nYou should be familiar with and know the rules of Risk because while there are in-game instructions, it doesn't go into full depth and there are mechanics that aren't explained at all (like combat).\n\nWhile the attacker is supposed to have the advantage (because they roll an extra unseen die), I tended to make sure I had a good amount more units than the defender because it always feels terrible to lose your whole stack and not even take anything. Keyboard shortcuts make it easier to attack with large stacks.\n\nI would've liked to have an optional window that showed the actual rolls (like in Blood Bowl) because I'd rather see under-the-hood how I lost a stack instead of having no idea what's going on.\n\nOnce in a while there are graphical glitches that require you to restart the game.\n\nIt's very easily missed but it also offers two expansion games, American History Lux and Ancient Empires Lux (and a third link that sends you to the 'buy product' page for a third title). These are a group of 10-12 scenarios with multiple difficulty levels that you can go through. They have no overarching story and are pretty much unrelated except for theme, so I wouldn't really consider it a campaign.\n\nIf you enjoy Risk, you might want to try out Lux Delux.","February 14","true","2.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Perfect to play during my long hours at work waiting for something to happen ...\n\nLux is so much fun for any fan of the Risk boardgame or any lover of strategy.\n\nThis turn based game in itself is simple, conquer the map ! But the AI won't let you do that very easily as it wants to win as well. Like in Risk, you conquer provinces with your armies. The more provinces you have, the more armies you will be able to field. Provinces also form " continents " which once you have united under to iron fist will get you even more troops. It's very simple.  There is also a multiplayer mod which I haven't tried yet but this is the perfect style of game to spend hours fighting other human beings.\n\nThe game comes with a bunch of maps, not only the classic Risk world-map. The wonderful thing about Lux is that you are able to download hundreds of other maps, from WWII scenarios to castle sieges or even some Star-Trek spaceships. A couple of clicks and you can get the maps you like from the game launcher. And if you are not satisfied by the imagination and talent of other players then you can make you very own map with the editor and why not share it.\n\nI can only recommend this game. I had never heard of it before seeing it was on sale but even at its full prince ( around 10€ ) it is worth it if you like the genre? Easy to learn, fast games but challenging.\n\nAs a side note : it says on my Steam page that I have O hours played on Lux but I used it on offline Steam ...","May 8, 2015","true","1.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

And not just once, but I've seen this many times...\n\nCheating like this is why I stopped playing Civ (at Civ 3 edition).\n\nIf the game needs to stack the odds in battles to be challenging, I don't want to play.","November 29, 2015","false","0.4"," 6 of 18 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","6","18","2","3"

Though the setup is awesome and the variety in maps is unmatched, the rather tiny community has enough bad apples to ruin the experience. You need chat to make alliances, etc. But if you don't do EXACTLY what another player wants you to do, even if in your judgement it compromises your game, you will get flamed non-stop in chat the rest of the game. Don't get me wrong, there are many nice folks playing too, but it only takes one troll berating you all game long to leave you saying "ah well, it was only 8 bucks."\n\nI played hundreds of matches on the Grand Strategy website and I ranked fairly high, considering the huge, international community, and yet I never encountered such childish negativity. I think the issue is that there aren't many people in this community yet, so you're getting the same trolls over and over, game after game. They are throwing away the devs hard work by chasing off anyone new that can recommend the game to others. It's not fun playing the way you want to, just to have a kid named "dollabillz" or "Yushin" trying to mad their way to victory. Youtube "Hellmuth blows up" and watch his reaction whenever he loses. These guys are Hellmuths behind a computer screen.\n\nI'm disappointed for cool members like TSK and many others that welcome new players. They know what it takes to succeed- more new players. But if you dare to take Kamchatka from a troll, or hit him in the Urals, beware!!! They will talk ♥♥♥♥ until you mute them, then suicide their Central Americans into you until you leave!","May 3, 2015","false","15.8"," 11 of 29 people (38%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","38","11","29","5","2"

It could easily be called Risk Online.

Also if you are a casual strategist this is perfect for you. If you are intense about strategy, I would reccommenf Medieval 2 Total War, Crusader Kings 2, or Civilization 5 instead.","August 20, 2015","false","5.7"," 4 of 15 people (27%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","27","4","15","2","0"
