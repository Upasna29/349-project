While some players praise the fresh rpg setting and the challenging quests, others critisize the imbalanced powers of the monsters.\n\nHere is what I experienced:\n\nPros:\n\n- easy to get started, self-explanatory game mechanics, well-made learning curve\n- a solid story about abusing power, elite leaders and supressing the masses, set in a post-nuclear Sweden, with a good sense of humour\n- long-time motivation for those who love challenges, as there are perfect builds to find, the limbo (a 45-level-dungeon) to raid etc.\n- Nice graphic style, clean and fitting sounds and soundtrack\n\nCons:\n\n- Disastrous balancing: Some enemies are way too weak, others will bring your team down in no time. It takes a lot of time to find a good build for the final battle - but it does not depend on your own skill, but more on puzzling together different boosters (that improve strength, defense, stamina etc)\n- Boring quests, standard rpg loot & collect tasks\n- The coop mode is only three levels - well, for a game that calls itself a coop game, it's sparse, to put it mildly\n\nIn the first ten hours of playing, I was about to tell friends to try out the game, as it had this fresh setting and things went on pretty well, absolving quests and looting dungeons. But then I was stuck more often due to strong enemies, no money to buy upgrades, and misspent boosters. The final battle got pretty frustrating as I did not find a build good enough to beat the final boss. Also, until today, I never found a single player in the coop lounge to join a game.\n\nConcerning that, I would not recommend to buy this game until one is going for a challenging rpg.","June 19, 2014","false","31.6"," 122 of 130 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","122","130","0","0"

The tactical team-based RTS/ARPG hybrid battle-system is exciting, innovative, and well-implemented, while various tweaks to the typical ARPG formula show the thoughtfulness of passionate game design.  The graphic design is consistent and thematically appropriate throughout. Sadly, Krater plays like a concept demo - a few hours of fun as you acclimate to the control scheme and unique design elements, followed by a steep drop-off in variety. The crafting system is essentially a grinding-incentiviser, and character progression is bizarrely limited in ways which are obviously designed to conjure up more grindplay. While the four classes do allow for some interesting combinations and teamwork, each class has only two skills. Although these skills can be tweaked in a variety of ways thanks to the unique augmentation system, the actual gameplay is largely unaffected by these tweaks and runs together in a wash of habitual button-mashing.\n\nIn many ways Krater succeeds - the writing is quirky, the world interesting, and the graphics stimulating. Unfortunately at the core of it all is an exceedingly repetitious experience. If your love for grinding or your desire to explore outweigh your distaste for repetitive gameplay, there is a unique and rewarding experience to discover here. Otherwise, avoid investing yourself in Krater: its innovation is only skin deep.\n","March 4, 2015","false","4.6"," 59 of 66 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","59","66","0","2"

Hence the thumbs down.  It seems like a lot of development went into the basic world design and not enough into specific character, combat, quest and dungeon design.  This makes the game very repetitive.\nThis is a top down RPG where you control a bunch of characters in a post apocalyptic world.\n\nThe good:\n1. Quite nice basic design.  It had a lot of potential.\n2. It seems like the game is huge.  Which is also a bad thing considering the simplicity of the combat system - you will get bored sooner or later.\n\nThe bad:\n3. Character development is very simplistic.  Each character has 2 skills.  Forever!\n4. Extremely repetitive action.\n\nThe ugly:\n5. You have to pay to enable you to develop your characters past a certain level.  Really irritating.\n6.

Even if, by sheer blind dumb luck, you manage to find the right place to click, the game frequently refuses to recognize input for no readily apparent reason.

And I can tell you that this game was one of the reasons why I am now completely cured of this Early Access. It looked promising, so promising in fact that I bought the unfinished product, even if this kind of game is not my cup of tea. Oh boy, was I disappointed.\n\nI will not speak about game mechanics, since there are already enough well written reviews covering that up. I will only tell why you should not buy this game, not matter how cheap it is sold in the next sale.\n\nKrater is pretty much in the same unfinished shape than the Eary Access version. The devs fixed some smaller things, forcing me to start over and over again, because everytime the update broke my save games. It still crashes, it still has problems with the webcode. But to me and other players one of the biggest problems of the game is the tiny font. As in "You need the Hubble telescope to read things" tiny. You can barely read item descriptions and crafting becomes a nice game of "squint & guess". People were complaining about this since the beta, but the devs just give a crap.\n\nThis game was already abandoned shortly after its release. The tiny font thing was never adressed, most of the bugs were never adressed. They released a single player character for 6 €, cashed in an went off to never look back.\n\nSadly, with a bit more work Krater could have earned a recommendation easily. It has charm, a great soundtrack, tons of fun loot, a nice crafting system and a great soundtrack. It even looks nice. Unfortunately the devs decided to leave this game alone and, considering Kraters still unfinished state, you should too.","August 13, 2014","false","10.6"," 41 of 51 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","41","51","0","0"

The thing that seperates it from those games is that instead of controlling 1 character, you'll be controlling a squad of three of them. Oh, and it's set in Sweden.\n\nYou navigate the game via a HUGE overworld map similar to games like Final Fantasy VII. You can expect random encounters to spice up your journeys and this is actually a really cool feature of the game. One suprising thing is, despite the huge world, levels load in really quickly.\n\nHowever, not all is good. Moving onto the combat - the combat was simply such a huge disappointment for me. It's so basic and the abilities cool down so fast, you'd think the game was set in Antarctica. Literally, every single battle just felt like I was playing guitar hero with the number keys in order to win.\n\nSpeaking of abilities, you'd think an action RPG on this scale has hundreds of them, right? Well I'll tell you now that there are 4 different classes in this game and how many abilities does each class have? Two. Yep, that's right: Two.\n\nBeing a game where about 80% of the time you'll be fighting, the combat system just makes it fall flat on it's face. There are plenty of other features like a confusing crafting system and permadeath party system, but they pretty much go unnoticed because of how terrible the rest of the game is.\n\nI wanted to like this game, but all the potential it had has just gone at the window, leaving it with a 3 out of 10.","January 20, 2014","false","6.9"," 38 of 50 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","38","50","0","0"

A lot of crafting, quests, and plenty of loot, but that was it. Midway through the game, nothing was worth crafting. Maybe a few upgrades here and there, but the ingredients for those were so rare, I'd barely ever craft anything. All the quests ended up being the same, kill enemies for drops and the defeat a boss. The loot, horrible. I think the whole point of picking anything up was just to sell to afford some of the ingredients for the off chance that you I something to craft. I've only obtained one epic and everything else was just vendor trash.\n\nThe dungeons, they're ALL THE SAME. Yes, there are randomized elements per playthrough, but imagine playing Diablo 1 and you just kep going down the church level for 40+ levels.

But... I am not gonna let you stay in the dark with the reason why though;\npoint1 - the freedom you get from it\nIn Krater, you have the freedom to pick from 4 different classes, build a team out of them how ever it pleases you, change the loadout of your characters and get to explore a variating postapocalyptic version of what seemed to be Sweden.\nnow to be honest:some classes are just obviously overpowered compared to others (slayer to regulator) you have eight and i am not joking here, EIGHT different skills to chose from in the entire game. Each class has two and the teams you build can have three characters maximum.\nNow to the loadout. Every character has two slots in the inventory. One for a weapons and one for a gadget. each weapong can only be used by one class and they normaly differ from one another like some flowerpots.\nAnd finally the map: instant traveling to a point on the map is not only a thing required to get from one end of the game to another, it's also slow as hell because you get to see a little blinky ping representing your team going wherever you told it to on the map in a speed that makes you wonder if in postapocaliptic sweden legos spawn from the ground or shoes were entirely eradicated or both. Also the levels are either so small that you can call them 'tight' or are equaly tight tunnel systems who seamingly end up in postapocalyptic Russia.\n\nPoint 2 - Atmosphere\nIt is obvious that alot of love went into the graphical developement of Krater but there are still some things just get annoying over time; NPC's mainly looking like each other, a notexisting plot and the music.\nWhith 'a nonexisting plot' I just want to underline that the game starts with all your characters being kicked of a town which they seem to have drunkenly terrorised and joining some kind of mercenary force which operates all over Krater. BAM raiders, freediggers, wildlife, reference to a country which cannot totaly be a reference to Germany ....WHAT?! why is everyone having bears and mooses in ther cellars? Why am I fighting people who dig holes into their own property? Oh wait... I am not fighting them? And why do i still not know any main villain? AND WHY HAS EVERYONE BECOME PYRO?! (ok the last one was unnecessary)\nLast point was also listing the music... Well, this is what disappointed me the most about the game; there are 18 tracks in this game which are used as themes for the different places, but why do 17 of them sound almost the same?! I literaly tried to memorize them as different songs with all their particularities but still: 17 of them sound like one giant synthetic smooth jazz remix and one is a rock song, but you have practicaly no chance whatsoever to tell the most from each other! I wish they had put in some more different sounds into this game. the atmosphere is just depressing if every place sounds the same! And I mean the bad kind of depressing. Also the music is nothing special. Not only is the music not changing, but it's not even good.\n\nAlthough it's a failure in my eyes and a waste of money I just can't stop myself from feeling pity for it.\nThanks for reading everyone.","August 4, 2014","false","4.5"," 23 of 30 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","23","30","0","0"

But deep inside, it´s nothing more than a mediocre RPG with poor pacing, a tiring combat-system and frustrating level-processing.\n\nStory After a nuclear war scoured the world, many survivalists try to make the best out of their situation: either by being a reputable citizen, by doing dubious job for mysterious organisations or by scavenge the treasures of the Crater and revealing it´s secrets.\nYou, the player, is trying to do the latter of the options, whilst controlling a team of three gas-masked survivalists to accomplish your final goal.\n\nGameplay Although the game claims to be a strategic ARPG, it´s nothing more than a simple hack&slash one.\nAs I mentioned before, you control a team consiting of three survivors, each of them have their own unique skills.\nWhilst only being able to play three survivors at the same time, you can choose from four different classes and rearrange your team based on them.\nThe four classes are: - The Bruiser --> Your typical tank, that operates as a shield for your team\n- The Slayer --> The assassine-ish class, that is able to hack it´s way through\nentire enemy hordes\n- The Medic -->  He heals your team, duh.\n- The Regutator --> Because of his stuns and slows, he is irreplaceable for the\nlate part of the game\n\nEvery character has two unique skills.....that´s it. They won´t obtain any new skills by leveling them up, which brings me to the next point:\n\nThe leveling system The games level-cap is 15, but your characters will start with level caps of 5.\nYou can unlock the next (overpriced) level cap by visiting a boot-camp and purchasing the said upgrade.\nBecause of the fact, that you have to purchase them, you spend a significant amount of time not earning any experience points and every fight seems to be nothing less than a time waste.\nBy reaching the next level of your character, you unlock slots for implants and boosters.\nWhile these upgrades aren´t as important in the early game as they should be, their bonuses are more than important for the later parts of the game.\nIt´s a shame that you can´t remove already operated upgrades. The only way to bypass this problem is to place the new booster/implants on the already taken slots without getting some sort of a refund for the lost one.\n\nGraphics There is nothing much to say about it seriously.\nThey are pretty on some occasions (dungeouns, cities, characters, monsters), but more then outdated in other aspects of the game (skills, world map).\nBlinking pools of blood, flickering textures aren´t a big deal at all, since they won´t happen very often.\nThe underwhelming distance rendering on the world map downgrades the experience of travels.\n\nLevel-Design & Enemies If you have seen one location/enemy,  you have seen them all.\nThis point is a very important one, because after playing this game for nearly 23 hours, I´ve grown tired of all the same looking enemy, the same looking cities, villages and dungeous.\nEvery city, village and dungeoun looks and feels the same.\nYou don´t grow attached to the locations or the people and after visiting 5 similar looking towns, you scratch you head and start thinking whether you run in circles and entering the one you´ve just left.\nThe same is for the enemy types. There is no variety whatsoever.\nIf I explore a dungeoun on the west side of the world map, I´ll encounter the same generic looking enemy as I would in a dungeon that´s located on the east side of the world map.\nAfter defeating the same survivor/bear/hound for the 200th time, you´ll grow tired of it.\n\nPro/Contra+ humorous dialogs\n+ post-apocalyptic setting\n+ big world to discover\n+ CO-OP\n-----------------------------\n- generic location-designs\n- generic enemy-designs\n- only two skills for every character\n- purchasable level-caps\n- level-cap of 15\n- gathering exp-points mostly time waste\n- repetitive combat-system\n- poor pacing\n\nSummaryIf you try to see past the countless flaws of the game, you´ll be greeted with a mediocre, yet sometimes fun game, that sadly isn´t able to distinguish itself from all the other, better ARPG out there.","August 24, 2015","false","23.8"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","0"

The overall effect is initially disorienting, but smooths out as you embrace your new existence as a 3-person hive mind.\n\nThe combat mechanic is pretty straightforward hack-n-slash (think Torchlight or Diablo), with the twist that you need to try to manage the actions of three heroes instead of just one.  After just a couple encounters, I realized that remapping my squad members' special abilities and treating the whole group as one entity was pretty critical to coordinating their efforts.  Over time it became apparent that much of the game's value lies in this novel approach.\n\nThe navigation from town to town and much of the writing is very reminiscent of the first Fallout games. Random encounters occur when moving between known (and unknown) world map locations and the NPCs scattered around have hilarious problems that they need you to help with.\n\nThere is also a basic crafting system and everything devolves pretty quickly into a treadmill of quest grinding and gear looting/upgrading.\n\nThe world is mildly intriguing, if you are into post-apocalyptic mythos, and exploring it is the main reason why I continued playing after I wearied of inventory shuffling.","January 4, 2014","true","4.1"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

Before you read the whole review and flip the table because I recommend you to try the demo: I recommend you to try the demo.\n\nThe class systemThe class is immediate and simple, yet it offers a lot to play with: there are four basic classes and two races, humans and mutants; every class has two abilities, that are different from humans and mutants. We have 16 different abilities to play with, so.\nThe four classes are:The Bruiser: the tank of the team capable of sustaining a large amount of damagesThe Medic: pretty obviousThe Regulator: a very useful support class, capable of stunning and slowing with the power of the electricityThe Slayer: a strength based character.Has to be mentioned how some abilities have very small differences, however, different abilities may lead to a complete different kind of build on the character.\n\nAbility system and diversificationEvery few levels we will unlock ability booster slots and implant slots, the former allow us to link a booster to our ability, the latter to link it to our character, improving our basic stats (we'll get to them in a moment).\nThe booster we can bind to our abilities vary from Power boosters, which improve the damage of our abilities, to Healing boosters, which gives life drain or heal aspects, to boosters that temporarily improve our stats.\nThe stats are:Strength: determines the amount of physical damage we do.Stamina: determines our maximum HPFocus: improves the healing effects of our abilities and the ranged physical damageIntelligence: decreases the cooldowns of the abilities we useDefence: reduces the damages taken\nThe game and its core mechanicsGame installed, new adventure begins, we're thrown in a very short and yet useful tutorial level; it tells us why we are where we are and lets us familiarise with the combat mechanics. Quite simply, right click on an enemy and wait until it dies, using the abilities of our characters when they're not under cooldown. A very simple and immediate mechanic, so, that is easy to learn and efficient to use to blend very RPG-like elements to the frenetic action of the combats; however, this wores out quickly, and in late game becomes kind of annoying, leaving the player no solution but to fall back on the booster/implants build to differentiate the gameplay.\n\nExecutionThe graphic engine isn't the lightest in the world, but it's still pretty accessible, granting very interesting visuals and effect, even though we may notice rare graphic artifacts here and there, such as blinking pool of blood. What is disappointing is how sometimes the game fails to read our inputs, truly annoying when there are enemies on the screen: think how fun it can be to use an ability that won't trigger (or won't do it every time with the same sequence of inputs), or having your characters turning back and running towards the enemies they were fleeing from. Fortunately, this is a minor issue that happens every once in a while, so even though it has some major influence when it happens, it can be overlooked if you like the rest of the game.\nThe sound department is what has stricken me the most: while the voice acting is kind of minimal, it's present and shows a successful effort to improve the immersion. The voices are in line with the game: humorous and funny, a good thing that reminds me of the Final Fantasy saga (Krater takes a good amount of inspiration from it, indeed). The sound effects are great, and you might often take a break from the game, listening the birds chirping with a beautiful background music.\nThe durability is another good point: the Single Player campaign won't take us less than 12 hours, and to defeat the last boss we need a good party, which will probably require several hours of grinding to find all the things we need. This is a game that can entertain us for dozens of hours, if we can overlook how repetitive it tends to be once reached the end game, or if we simply love the good old grinding for items and gold, Diablo II style.\n\nConclusionKrater is an indie game not free of flaws, but capable of gifting hours and hours of fun to those who can go beyond its deficiencies and limitations, easily worth its full price, a rip-off on sale.\nBuy it if you like action RPG and dungeon crawlers with a good humor, but most likely try the demo, as this is a very particular and unique game.\n\nIf you need ratingsGraphic: 7\nSound: 9\nLongevity: 7\nGameplay: 6\n\nFinal Score: 7/10","June 27, 2015","true","37.5"," 36 of 64 people (56%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","56","36","64","3","0"

It could have been so much more, another example of atmosphere and graphics being prioritized higher than the actual gameplay.

Some dungeons can take 2 hours to clear, so I had to force myself to keep playing long after I got bored to avoid losing progress.

Each character has 2 special attacks in addition to main attacks. Graphics are good, world is interesting, but character management is HORRIBLE. You don't seem to need to keep the same party from behinning to end as you swap out characters almost at whim. Crafting involvies finding blueprints and buying or finding parts and/or ingredients, and those can be hard to come by. There is no "auto-loot" which makes combat clean-up tedius. Improving characters means giving them "implants", and growth involves finding weapons with buffs (yes, "Pistol of +2 INT" or such) and/or implants (which are basically equipped buffs).

It has been fixed now and works great. You can even keep your original characters instead of having to swap them out once you hit level 5 with them. You also now have Co op play so some fun can be had with friends and the dungeons. The developers care about Krater and listened to feedback from players to improve the game and put things in the community wanted.\n\nEssentially we have an ARPG with a beautiful looking post nuclear setting, you start with 3 pre determined characters and head into town for the usual starter type quest.......basement / small room, kill rats or other small animals.\n\nIt literally draws you in from the moment you start. Krater has humorous writing and some wild looking characters albeit very similar. The world, dungeons and effects are superb and on level with some of the more expensive titles in the genre.\n\nWell worth grabbing this game either for single or co op play. The reviews are now null and void as the game has evolved since release.

'Aren't there any downsides ?', I hear you ask ? Unfortunately, yes. Instead of using 3 main characters, you'll be switching them around several times during your playthrough. There's just no connection.\nAnd even though the upgrade system allows for a lot of custom builds; it's actually so diverse that you'll die quite often just because of this system. I'm stuck near the end and I just can't beat the final boss. It's impossible. Literally. Ok, I'm exaggerating. It IS possible, but you'll have to rebuild your characters entirely.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BarryCop/recommended/42170/","BarryCop","Fion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BarryCop/","593 products in account","Krator was a pretty decent game although there were drawbacks that made me from playing it all the way through at times laying it down and playing it again maybe a year later from an old save. What made me do that? Well I'm going to tell you.\n\nI won't go into the good parts of the game like its graphics. Voices for characters the looks of your guys. Other things that made it good. But instead only its main cons that made me very upset with how the developers made the game.\n\n1. Barely no customization. None what so ever in changing how your characters look. Except for the weapons they carry. The only way is to buy a new character that looks different but the same class and scrap the other one basically. Or keep  the old one and keep them as backup.\n\n2. Only a 3 man squad at all times even though your party can be huge. Say 9 people are partners going about the wasteland and helping eachother except in battles or dungeons only 3 of them are fighting and doing missions for the ENTIRE group. Where is the backup? The other backpackers? The sniper helping out? NOPE! None. Only 3 guys of your choosing at all times. Theres not even mods that change this which could of been excellent for the game but no, those never came up. This made it really hard to complete the game which I still haven't because the bosses and enemies can get so hard its not even worth playing anymore without a friend coming to help. If only you could use your whole party and not only 3 of them that you could actually get things done faster and better. Whats the point in spending all your hard earned cash on new followers if you can't really have them out with your whole team. They need backup. This basically made the game dead for me. And extremely hard and not worth playing for a long time. It made it very grindy because while your old characters are out and doing the missions the others are not getting any experience and fall down the usage wheel and basically become dead weight cause they can't fight any of the higher level enemies.\n\nSo with those two out of the way thats the only two main cons that made a lot of people upset. Its those two choices they made that really set the game level to drop for playability. And made it frustrating.\n\nThe stories are fine, going through the map is fine, enemies are fine IF you could actually use your whole team and not just 3. Perma-death is awesome and makes you think over your choices except doesn't really have much of a point if your team isn't really helping all that much. All in all I can't recommend this game all that much cause of the future people who play this game that will get frustrated with its bad developer choices that made this game dead for me. But others may like it and I did like the story and I do want to finish the story.\n\nIf they make the parties bigger it would be a huge major help for us singleplayer users that don't have a friend that wants to play this game to boost your party to 6 characters that go on the map. How is that fair for us as singleplayer users I might add? It makes the game easier but way more harder and frustrating for single player.\n\nIf anyone that made this game sees this review, please, please, please make us be able to have a bigger party out for the single player users.

My partner and I decided that not only is this game not great for co-op but not that great altogether. Before we got to the co-op part, we had to move through an initial stage individually. In this initial stage, you gather the 3-man squad that turns this into a squad-based, top-down action-RPG. This would have been a simple process if the camera control hadn’t required constant adjustments and mouse controls. Also would have been a lot easier if I had known you need to control all three squad members the same way you control units in an RTS game.\n\nOnce we got to the hub area, we met up; my three squad members and their identical 3 squad members. We entered a co-op mission and promptly found the gameplay generic, the only two powers each character gets a little dull, the multiple identical characters just confusing and the game wasn’t engaging at all.\n\nFor full review, visit:\nhttp://icarusreviews.net/2013/11/15/brief-write-of-a-brief-flight-krater/","January 4, 2014","false","2.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

A lot of it's issues lay at it's most core foundation, and it will keep nagging you from start to finish. It's biggest issue is that right from the get go, your skills per charater are already desided for you. Each 'class' always has the same attacks no matter what, witch makes the next guy to replace your last not feel any different...because he's not. Yet here comes the next kicker, charater rarity.\n\nYou have a team of 3 you use at once to clear maps, and it is massivly encouraged on you to buy and collect new guys to use, including once you relise 'white and green' 'rarity' versions of these guys have far less stats overall then their 'blue and purple' versions you don't start finding till a bit later on, after you've dumped a ton of money and gear into these other versions, and now have to scrap for the 'better'. Of couse the people you hire are all at level 1, and there is a 'max growth' cap on the 'lesser' units that will indeed force your hand to swap out that group that got you half of the way with the game...for another who work exactly the same, need to be leveled up all over again, if only because they can level up 5 more times then your last set and have a few more points overall, because you will need that extra 'omph' as you go more and more forward.\n\nWhat little this game does as nifty ( such as the team dynamic, the crafting, and the visurals ) are just knocked down by a lot of pegs because it's got such a basic core, that drags it's feet because you will waste more time buying and upgrading 'slightly better' versions of your guys for others, and you never really get different attacks, only slightly changing a few effects towards them.","March 15, 2014","false","3.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I enjoy the exploration and the dialog is actually quite fun. But it could have been better...even great.\n\nThe characters need more variety.  Each charater type (tank, dps and healer) have 3 rarities and depending on rarity they will have one (out of two) skill/ability sets.  True, you can add upgrades to the charaters, but even then you have limited choices.\n\nMaybe if each charater had a pool of diffrent skills available but only 2 of them could be used at a time (and you had to return to a town to change them) it would make it more interesting. (i don't know but is needs something to make the charaters more interesting)\n\nAs it stands, you pick up the best charaters you can find. then swap one out when you find a rarer one and once you have the rarest you can find, you end up sticking with them till the end.  If one gets killed...who cares, find another of the best rarity you can find and move on.\n\ntl;dr = Good game, great enviroment, but needs more charater skills/abilitys, more charater variety, more reason I should care about my charaters...just needs more!","December 14, 2013","true","81.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The enemies can be challenging but are generous with both the quantity and quality of loot. You gain levels quickly but only the three active team members get XP from encounters, if you want to keep your entire roster at the same level you’ll have to grind at least twice. Speaking of levels, you need to use the in-game currency to gain access to levels 6 – 10 and 11 – 15 which annoyed me. You can't access the menus from the world map either, also annoying.\n\nTaken as a whole, the game is decent and entertains me.

Its qunitecential Swedish setting, campaign story, voice acting and dialogue is a joy to experience.\n\nControlling three of four different character types, all with their own core abilities (Healer, Melee guy, Tank and Tech-mage makes combat something different to normal aRPG.  It piqued my interest by offering a slightly different levelling mechanism, one which adds to the overall sense of achievement.\n\nIn addition your characters maxlevel is capped and must be purchased to go beyond a certain level.  At each level you open up booster and implant slots which enhance your characters attributes and add to their core abilities.  Which really makes your need to find sellable items and cash that much more urgent than just buying equipment.\n\nThe crafting portion is a real joy adding a diverse collection of crafting recipes and ingredients which as you can imagine are accumulated through playing .  The real positive is the combination of alternative story/setting and the tactical group combat which takes this from being an also ran dungeon-crawler to something a little different and ultimately worth a second look.\n\nA real surprise.","September 14, 2013","true","20.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

With polish and some extra depth in lacking areas, such as story, balance, and expansion and greater incorporation of the imagined mechanics , this could be a a hit, especially featuring its somewhat fresh take on a post-apocalytic setting.\n\nAs is, the game falls flat after a while, but playing with the mechanics and building a functioning party provided enough entertainment for me to devote time to the title.  I sincerly hope that the IP is continued and that the mechanics are improved upon massively.

It's a top down real-time RPG, you can have up to three members in your party and party members are recruited by class (Berserker, Tank, Controller, Healer). The novel twist to this game is the class mods that allow you to tweak how your ability work.\n\nSo while each character has only two skills shared between all characters of that class, how they function depends on the class mod you slot into them. So say your controller has a slow field, you can throw in a heal mod to make that slow field slow enemies and heal party members, or a shock mod to make it slow and shock enemies, or a [stat] buff mod to buff team mates. And so on. It's novel. And while the game is original, I found the story to be unengaging. It's relies on a self-depricating Scandinavian sense of humour which seems to be popular (Dungeons of Dredmor anyone?) at the moment.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sobegreen/recommended/42170/","sobegreen","SoBe Green -V-","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sobegreen/","83 products in account","The Good: Somewhat refreshing take on a top scrolling RPG. You have some humor in a lot of the dialogue that keeps this game from taking itself too seriously. For the price tag the visuals are slightly above average with a decent soundtrack. This game is not a top shelf game. If it had been released in a store this is the type of game that would be in the $15-$20 bin within a month of the release. If you expect this much you will not be disappointed.\n\nThe Bad: The combat system leaves a lot to be desired. I found in my short time playing I could win a fight by just pounding keys 1-6 in order. Often I was pulling extra groups just to enjoy fighting. Each character only has two abilities and once you learn the proper order to put them in based on their cool downs (which isn't very long even on the bigger abilities) you can probably just run your finger back and forth on the number keys. The healing system is also a pain to use. It revolves around a quick heal or a channeled heal but both are based on a cool down timer so you can literally spam heals over and over not to mention with the combat system being as easy as it is you rarely need to. I found my healer often spends most of his time auto attacking because he has no offensive ability. Last but not least the "dungeon crawls" are extremely repetitive. There isn't a wrong path to take or a secret door to enter its just a set map with a few different paths. Often to even get the full reward of playing you might as well clear it all rarely ending up with crafting materials to make the important items. This brings me to the last gripe: The crafting system. Every time I found myself trying to grind to get materials to make an item that same item ended up dropping as loot or something insanely better. I'd wager you could complete this entire game without ever crafting a single thing.\n\nBut for $15 or cheaper you really can't go wrong. If this game were $20 I would have not recommended this game.","November 11, 2013","true","6.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The mechanics are very simple and reminiscent of Diablo or Fallout with a smaller skill tree, class system and a lot of grind once youre at an advanced point in the storyline.\n\nThe storyline is generic but the artwotrk and overal asthetic of the game is beutiful, Not the charecter design however but the overall scenery in game and actual cyutscene artwork does deserve some praise.\n\nThe Gameplay is quite cluncky and you will find yourself saying "WTF i did not say go that far....STOP YOU Intercourse Muscle head, born of five mothers and expelled by 2 fathers STOOOOPPPP!!!"\n\nhowever I do suggest playing this game caussaly because it is quite (Personaly I find) beautiful and simple but in all honesty its just a "Switch of game" that can be played when there is nothonig to do.","July 1, 2014","true","6.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It might have been subpar when it first came out and greatly improved upon since then via updates, of which I am not sure, but what it is now is way better than the metascore would suggest. Good graphics, great sound effects like loud thuds and booms and electric static field reversals, and controls well. And probably the best thing about it, fantastic music. It ranges from moody to inspiring and gets you into the game and sets the atmosphere of the game perfectly.\nI seriously don't see any reason that this game deserves under a 70. Well one thing I do not like about it is that there are not many skills to use for your characters. You control 3 guys, each gets 2 skills, so you use the same 6 skills from start to finish, which sucks ♥♥♥, but you can get 1 other skill to equip for each guy so you get a few more to choose from. Besides that I really enjoy the game.\nPC Gamer gave this a 50 and gave Duke Nukem Forever a 80... that right there should tell you that this is without a doubt worth playing, and should also tell you that PC Lamer should have their editorial license revoked immediately and permanently.","February 23, 2014","true","14.1"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ryanrad3/recommended/42170/","ryanrad3","RyanRad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ryanrad3/","492 products in account","Krater is a squad based post-apocalyptic real time strategy RPG.  Now that may seem like a mouthful of gaming mechanics, but imagine it being a mix of Diablo, and a little bit of MMO.  I know that sounds unconventional, but bear with me.\n\nYou control a squad of three 'soldiers' who can be of various classes.  You can also have many different characters in your 'reserve' that you may swap at any time outside of combat.  These classes range from tanks, healers, and damage dealers; thus, the MMO trinity. (For those unaware of the MMO 'trinity'; it is the basic make up of a group you would need in order to tackle a difficult dungeon/challenge; a tank to absorb and take all the damage, a healer to heal the tank and group, and a damage dealer (one or more) in order to drop your enemies.) While you do not have to follow the trinity, I would imagine that it would be difficult to conquer the harder challenges in the game without it.\n\nWhat's so exciting about this concept is that instead of executing just one role as you would in an MMO, you control all three roles.  You're controlling your tank, your healer, your damage dealer, and their abilities all at once.  Now, each soldier only has 2 independent skills each as opposed to the many you would have otherwise, but this makes the game-play a lot less complex and allows you to micromanage each squad member without feeling overwhelmed.\n\nThe game is entirely real time so you are required to think on your feet when you engage in combat.  Not only that, but the game is loot driven as well, you are able to loot your enemies after taking them down and there is a chance to get some great weaponry.  If you enjoy real time strategy and diablo-esque dungeon crawlers with some loot and crafting mechanics, this is the game for you. Did I mention it had coop?\n\nYou can find more of my ramblings about video games at www.chatswithrad.com","July 26, 2015","true","6.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I LIKED THIS GAME.\n\nbut...\n\n- Its full of small and annoying bug thats does not seems to be fixed for years now. Some of them makes you not able to get achovements that are simply broked. Does not work, just like that. If you are kind of guy ( I am for sure ) who likes to have 40/40 achivements then game will dissapoint you.\n- Co-op is non existant, so if you buy this game be sure you want to play it single.\n- Game randomly crashes sometimes.\n- You reach max lvl way too fast and only weapon progress seems to keep your down from pulling all map at once.\n\nAnyway I really enjoyed this game while I played it only for 2-3 days. Thats max you can get from it, while keep enjoying content(more or less).\n\nWord of advice:\n\n1) Get OFF card, its not worth this 15E\n2) Dont buy DLC those are only 1 hero to recruit.

Krater sat in my Steam library for a long time before I ever installed it and fired it up.  Boy was that a mistake! For some reason I thought this game would be an RTS or a top down racing game.  This game is pretty much a Fallout meets Diablo game, and a damn good one at that!  The character customization is interesting enough to carry you through the story, and the locations change up and never feel stale.  I couldn't reccomend this game enough.  The co-op appears to be fairly dead, but my guess is that most people don't realize what this game truly is, and that is a crazy good time!","September 1, 2013","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A better-looking (and more technically demanding) game than Torchlight. The variety in terms of art assets feel noticeably lacking though. Very limited selection of music, dungeon tiles, and set pieces means that none of the towns and dungeons feel very distinct.\n\nWhere this game really falls apart, however, is in the game mechanics and itemization. Every five levels, you hit a level cap, and you either have to ditch the party member and recruit a new one that can advance to higher levels, or pay a significant amount of money to unlock the ability to level further. Leveling up provides no satisfaction because the only tangible upgrade is the unlocking of slots to put modifiers in. Modifiers that require you to grind to be able to craft or buy. You will likely hit the game's level 15 cap long before you can afford the better modifiers.\n\nEach party member only has two skills. There is no skill tree to speak of, and the only messing around with builds you can do is to add modifiers to a skill. There are a sparse handful of weapon models, and no unique / legendary loot. No set items either, not that there would be much point since each character only has a weapon slot and a consumable slot.","March 19, 2013","false","33.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You're given control of three characters at a time but don't let the thoughts of micromanaging put you off, as it hardly feels like a chore. Each of your characters has a different class such as tank, ranged damage, healer, and others you can get though playing the game. All of their skills are laid out on your skill bar so there's no need to click each separate character just to use their skills.\n\nAlong with that all of your characters abilities are very customizable. The regulator character's slow aura for instance can be altered to also heal allies that stand inside of it, or damage enemies that touch the aura. You can have the bruisers taunt ability give a defense buff to nearby allies.\n\nOn top of all that, the game makes use of a wide color pallet. A feature not seen very often in today's video games.

Having stated that, the game is not overly complex and as many have said, most dungeons are quite simplistic.  However, I rather enjoy that aspect as it makes for a "quick game" here and there.  Some of the controls could stand to be a bit better, and as many have said, the cooperative aspects of the game feel incomplete.\n\nThe setting is unique with a rather interesting story.  I deeply enjoy post-apocalyptic/cyberpunk games such as Shadowrun or Syndicate, and this game fits right in.  The more I play this title, the more I enjoy it.  I highly recommend this game for very casual gamers who enjoy similar titles, with an emphasis on very casual.\n\nMore serious gamers will most certainly be put off by the various flaws in the game, which can be an annoyance.

You spend 99% of the game underground, fighting dumb (and apparently deaf) enemies every 10 meters. The more your upgrade your men, the stronger your enemies get, and the longer the fights take.

Seriously. No brown-n-bloom, it's a world recovering from a nuclear war.\n+Hilarious weaponry. The bruiser class can wield a gas stove strapped to a metal pole as a flaming bludgeon, for example.\n+If you hit an enemy with a critical hit, they explode. For example, I had a massive brute armed with a push mower, he was so massive he swung that thing like a stick. He went toe-to-toe with a bear and the mower's motor was going full tilt. Next thing you know, he ♥♥♥♥ing slapped that bear across the face with the mower's bottom so hard the bear DETONATED. ♥♥♥♥ING BEARSPLOSIONS.\n+bork bork bork put dur chikkin in dur booshkit\n+Ability customization. Wanna make your slayer's impaling attack steal health from the enemy? Attach healing boosters to it!  Wanna make your regulator's electric field deal damage over time? Attach a damage booster to it!\n\n-Not much else to be had ;3;\n-Sometimes the difficulty of an area can be seriously out of hand. My team got stampeded by a mutant moose, two bears (lol 2bear), eight wolves and approximately 2.3 boars.\n-Fatshark will not continue with this game.

The events are set in Sweden after what must have been a nuclear strike. What was once Stockholm is now a large crater where people try to make a living by digging up the remnants of the past civilization, while defending themselves from bandits and mutated animals. I'm drawn to apocalyptic stories and liked the basic idea behind this game. Being Swedish myself, I could appreciate the references to Swedish language and culture.\n\nHowever, the game quickly become repetitive. You spend 99% of the game underground, fighting dumb (and apparently deaf) enemies every 10 meters. The more your upgrade your men, the stronger your enemies get, and the longer the fights take. The game soon starts to feel like work. I stopped after having explored less than half of the map. The focus of this game should have been exploration, rather than repetitive fights.\n\nGraphics design and animation is more than okay, but ambient sound and voice acting reminded me more of games made in the mid 90's, such as the Swedish "Backpacker" series. The music was okay and fitting, but repetitive like the rest of the game.","May 14, 2015","false","19.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
