In short, recommended, but with some warnings.\n\nThe game comes in two versions. FFX International, FFX-2 International - there are also two more extras: Eternal Calm for FFX and Last Mission for FFX-2. All is accessible from FFX's main launcher, of which it contains mini-settings to select language and graphic options also. Language is, sadly, tied directly to in-game dub. If you choose English, you can only hear English dub and English text, and so does for Japanese. There's a mod made by community so you can crossover the Japanese dub with English text (which seemingly majority of players like).\n\nGraphic options, although presets are selectable from main launcher, the whole brand new settings are available in-game like Anisotropic, Vsync, AA, screen mode (borderless, windowed or full screen) and of course screen resolutions. No matter how monstrous your rig is, the game's locked to 30 FPS.  Whether it's pure laziness of their part or the game engine's limitation, I can't say for sure. But for playing experience, it's still fine although not the best one. At the very least you can adjust all to the max if your rig is powerful enough, or tone down the settings one by one so you can get stable FPS if your rig is weaker.\n\nA few notable notes:\n1. if your rig comes with dual-GPU like what's commonly found in laptop, the game preselects your WEAKER GPU. Make sure you force the GPU's control panel to select your better/dedicated card.\n2. As of today 13/5/2016, the game often crashes when you select higher quality of the graphical settings. This should be fixable by patches from Square Enix, but who knows. To play safely, just set the options to lowest possible.\n3. The game now offers fast-forward options, but movies are still not skippable. Very useful if you don't want to watch the scenes all over again if you had previously played its predecessors.\n4. The game is DRM-free. Just execute FFX&X-2_LAUNCHER.exe if you want to play outside Steam. Keep in mind that you won't get achievement or Cloud Saving or Trading Card (as it's not registered properly with Steam) that way.\n\nAudio comes with two options, the original version or arranged. Amazingly, you can change the setting on the fly through in-game option. At the end of the day, both versions are just fine for my ears, so it's just a matter of preferences. And no, it's not like Steam FF7's original MIDI releases, thankfully.\n\nGameplay and story, I don't have much to say as they are untouched and just carbon copy paste of the original releases.\n\nAs for the control options, the game offers fully customizable settings. If you dislike the default keyboard button assignments, there's a menu to rebind everything to your liking. I myself use my trusty F310 controller for this game and only had to tweak two buttons (swapping 'A' with 'B' function). And yeah, Square Enix's releases mostly only support Xinput, so for Dinput controllers you have no choice but to wrap it with x360ce for example.\n\nWith two games packaged into one, it makes sense that this game is more expensive than previous FF releases on Steam, so keep that in mind when you weigh based on pricing alone.\n\nOverall, good game and recommended, they just need to fix the crash issues urgently and hopefully they listen - unlock 30 FPS limiter and give us skippable movies.","May 13","true","45.4"," 228 of 237 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","228","237","0","9"

To many, this game is an absolute classic, and to me one of my favourite games of all time. Never before have I been so moved by a video game’s story.\n\nFinal Fantasy X was made to make the huge leap to PS2, and also to pay homage to the classic Final Fantasy’s combat system. It is an undeniable masterpiece, showing off that Square Enix were more than ready to make the next step in RPG gaming. In 2015, more than 13 years after its initial release, we were blessed with a HD Remaster to take us all back to how we felt all those many years ago. But now, in 2016, we are now blessed with the nostalgia bomb; our beloved Final Fantasy X on glorious PC. When this game popped up on my steam homepage I had to restrain myself from going bat ♥♥♥♥ crazy.\n\nEnough about my story with this game, let’s get on to the easy-to-digest pros and cons:\n\nPort Analysis: It’s a very good port (especially for Square Enix standards), probably even better than the PS3’s port, no graphics bugs or glitches so to speak of so far. My main gripe is that there is a 30FPS lock, but with a game like this it’s tolerable. There are also a few sound bugs with footsteps and lag on attacks but these are minor. Emulator-esque game boosters come with this port which can speed up the game (except for cut scenes, annoyingly…), increase or completely remove random encounters, supercharge your characters to ridiculous levels, and remove the HUD. There are also ‘cheats’ which can give you 99 of all items or maximum AP. EDIT: I have discovered advanced graphics settings. They are accessed in game in the Esc menu. Many resolution options, borderless windowed and some basic low, medium, high graphic settings are available.\n\nPros (Brace yourself, there are many):\n\n+ One of the best soundtracks in a video game you’ll ever hear.\n\n+ One of the most emotional roller coasters of a story in gaming. You will laugh, you will cry, you will fume, you will smile, this game is perfect for the sensitive soul.\n\n+ An assortment of likable characters, no stale personalities here (‘cept for maybe Yuna, but you gotta have one straight man).\n\n+ Very flexible levelling system with the sphere grid.\n\n+ Beautiful CGI-cutscenes, even by today’s standards.\n\n+ Combat System is classic turn based in X; solid, easy to pick up, and engaging. Some people may like the faster paced, ATB based system and those that do can play X-2 which uses that system instead.\n\n+ Very good English dub. No Japanese voice option (modding can probably solve this), but if you’re like me you mostly remember the English dub.\n\n+ Upgraded visuals improve the game’s look and feel without detracting from its charm.\n\n+ No need to grind too much. I played through the game fighting every encounter without fleeing and I was about high enough level to beat bosses.\n\n+ Choice between original and remastered soundtracks.\n\n+ Blitzball is exciting and luck based fun!\n\n+ Addition of autosaves.\n\n+ Controller intergration in great for the 360 Controller. Buttons are mapped fine with onscreen instructions. Vibration support as well.\n\n+ Plenty of side quests and other hidden treasures to discover.\n\n+ Extras previously only available in Japanese versions.\n\n+ Over 40 hours of gameplay, and that’s just the main storyline!\n\n\nProcons\n\n~ Port is iffy. Works fine, plenty of graphics of options, but the dreaded 30FPS lock. Also there are sound glitches with footsteps and occasional lag.\n\n~ CGI Cutscenes are unchanged. They still look good, I was just hoping SE would remake these cut scenes with their updated graphics engine. Then again, it’s great for the nostalgia seekers like me.\n\n~ For people unfamiliar with this game the Sphere grid may be confusing\n\n~ Final Fantasy X-2\n\n\nCons\n\n- People new to this game may think it is still dated, which it kind of is, let’s be honest…\n\n- Game is slow to progress in the first 8 or so hours.\n\n- No Japanese voice (mods will fix this I’m sure).\n\n- Un-skippable cutscenes (can’t even be sped up through using the in-game boosters).\n\n- Blitzball can be very infuriating when the RNG hates you. Also if you want to 100% the game and get all ultimate weapons you HAVE to play Blitzball.\n\n- Combat is slower than ATB systems but can be mitigated with the hyperspeed boosters.\n\n\n\n- One of the most cringiest cutscenes in the history of gaming, you all know the one I mean.\n\n\nOverall:  Solid port, game lives up to its legacy as a widely regarded gaming masterpiece. To those who have never played this game and considering it, do it. Ignore the slightly dated animations and graphics, this game is one you’ll never forget.\n\n10/10","May 14","true","4.6"," 624 of 766 people (81%) found this review helpful 357 people found this review funny","81","624","766","357","32"

Not just the widescreen HD, but the option to have original music or the crappy rearranged music.  The PS3 version of this didn't allow original music.\n\nThe cheats are insanely cool.  F1 turbo modes X2 and X4, F2 supercharged (every attack allows for overdrive), F3 Encounter toggle (none, normal and excessive), and F4 auto-battle.  You can also "change parameters" which appears to allow options of instantly having 99 of each common customization material, max Gil and "Unlock All Skills".\n\nOther boons with this over even the PS3 remaster:  independent control of audio channels: master, music, speech, sound effects, all on sliders.  Both keyboard key bindings and controller bindings are programmable.\n\nThe only downside is if a person doesn't think to modify their video settings as soon as you get to the launcher.  It defaulted to Medium resolution and 1280x760 graphics for me instead of High 1920x1080, which it runs flawlessly.

You should get this game...it is amazing, my favorite, and has withstood the test of time. ♥\nThe positives:\n+ LOADS of content, expect to get 40-60+ hours worth of enjoyable content from FFX, and another 30+ hours from FFX-2\n\n+ Visually the game looks fantastic, especially for a PS2 game that came out in 2001. It's almost unbelievable. The higher resolution mixed with some updated textures does nothing but improve upon the original, although some areas do look a bit nicer than others.\n\n+ The story is amazing, filled with mystery, adventure, and loads of surprises. To put it in very simple terms, you are trying to defeat a huge Godzilla-like magical creature born from sin that has been causing massive destruction, death, and suffering throughout the world. (there's also a ton of interesting lore to discover throughout the game)\n\n+ Many voice acted characters with fantastic dialogue and great personalities.\n\n+ In FFX you have 7 characters to choose from, each with their own unique traits and abilities, although normally you choose your 3 favorites and can switch between characters at anytime even during battle.\n\n+ The turn based combat system is surprisingly a lot of fun and much deeper than you would expect. There's tons of skills, abilities, special moves, "overdrives" (very powerful attacks), spells, an overload of weapons / armor custimizations, and so much more. In combination with the amount of characters you get to use, every player will likely have a different strategy to defeat many of the bosses.\n\n+ Challenging Bosses! Trust me this game is no walk in the park, and revolves around the many, many bosses you will encounter throughout the game. Each one is unique and actually pretty thrilling to fight as you learn their weaknesses and strategeize your plan of attack.\n\n+ Aeons which are summoned powerful magical creatures to fight for you are an amazing addition although optional. They each look great, come with some fantastic animations and skills, can be customized, and really just add another layer of greatness on top of everything else.\n\n+ Hidden / Extra content, there's at least 10-15hours worth of "Extra" content in FFX that most people skip over. This content is mainly for people who finished the game and are looking for "more", although it's absolutely incredible to me that the developers decided to add so much! There's "Celestrial Weapons" which are the best weapons in the game that you must find parts often in hidden areas or obtained through completing difficult minigames / sidequests. There's a TON of extra end-game bosses like Dark Aeons or the bosses in the Monster Hunter area. Monster Hunting in itself is quite a large chunk of extra content that essentially has you go around capturing monsters to create new very challenging bosses with very unique rewards. There's 3 "hidden" and yet very powerful optional aeons that are absolutely worth getting. There's also new dungeons with powerful creatures and loot.\n\n+ Blitzball...sort of like underwater soccer using your hands is basically a game within a game. You can hire new players, level them up and learn unique blitzball abilities, and there's leagues and championships which give their own rare and unique items. This game in itself adds an extra like 1-5+ hours of content although again completely optional\n\n+ The game runs perfectly on my PC. Fast load times and I didn't experience any problems or any crashes whatsoever with max settings. Some may complain that it's 30fps, but this game was designed for 30fps so you will not notice any slowdown or stutter whatsoever.\n\n+YOU CAN PLAY WITH A CONTROLLER, I played through the entire game with an Xbox One Wireless controller. I did NOT have to keybind anything, it auto-detects it, and even changes the in-game button prompts to display Xbox buttons which was very nice of them to do.\n\nFew downsides:\n- The new arranged soundtrack isn't nearly as good as the original, but it IS OPTIONAL and you can switch between the two throughout the game if you wish. (Again Original is best)\n\n- The Remastered character faces look a bit odd and expressionlist at times, I mean at times Tidus looks like he's wearing some heavy eyeliner lol.\n\n- You still can't skip cutscenes...this is especially bad if you fail a boss and have to rewatch a 5minute scene\n\n- I know for a fact, many people think the bosses in the game are "too challenging" most people will get stuck at some point and many will end up giving up. (if this is you, please look up some strategy guides!)\n\n- There are some cringe-worthy moments during a few scenes, and the facial animations are a bit dated. Personally I enjoy them, but new players may be turned off a bit at first.\n\n- This is a personal note, but there's one character named Kimahri who is practically useless throughout the entire game, and has very little character development throughout the story.\n\n- The Story while being very interesting can also be extremely confusing. Especially once you reach the end of the game, and want to know more details about how the game began, how sin was born, how Jecht and Tidus got to Spira, about the Machina War, and about the timeline. The game is quite vague on many of these questions.\n\nPC Exclusive Features / Details:\nTurbo: Speed up the game x2 or x4 (this is amazing for grinding late game)\nSupercharge: Characters will be supercharged\nEnemy Encounter Override: Increase or Decrease encounter rate\nAuto battle: Characters fight using AI\nHide HUD: For Screenshots\nUsing anything above will NOT prohibit earning achievements\n\nNew Arranged Soundtrack that is completely optional and can be changed at any point in the game to the Original Soundtrack (ORIGINAL IS BEST)\n\nThere's also an "expert spheregrid" which lets you greatly customize the characters beyond what the normal sphere grid allows, although entirely optional and unneeded.\n\n\n\n\n\nSide Note: I played through and completed this game back in 2002, so I admit I may be a bit blinded by nostalgia. I will say however, I enjoyed playing this game far more today as I was able to discover so much that I missed as a kid","May 12","true","66.2"," 106 of 119 people (89%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","89","106","119","6","8"

I sat and watched him play it for hours. Fastforward to Christmas, my older brother and I unboxed our very own PS2 with Kingdom Hearts and Tekken 4 inside. My mom bought us extra controllers so we wouldn't fight. Mine was blue, my brothers was red.

From there, it was a race to beat sin.\n\nThe point I'm making is that FFX was so powerful to the community of young gamers who evolved from SNES and PS1 JRPG's (Lufia, Chrono Trigger/Cross, Alundra, Musashi, FF 7/8/9) in a way that impacted our memories. It brought my brother and I together, which at the time was rare. The soundtrack would play through the house daily. It meant more that just a dip into nostalgia to play through it again, it brought me to a time when I first started to feel inspired by the medium.\n\nFor those who missed the chance to experience it years ago, I hope that you play it.

I've made myself not replay this since its release for the very reason that it might show up on PC someday (Long before we started getting FFs on Steam) I had to stop myself from getting the PS3 version, the PS4, etc.\n\nThis version is really well done, they've also added a bunch of extras such as by holding a button you can speed up the game (Music stays the same so no weirdness there) 2x or 4x even á la frame skip on emulators! You can also hide the HUD (I personally turn if off when exploring to remove the map) and there's 5-7 other features as well. Along with some great graphical settings.\n\nYou also have the ability to choose between the arranged or original soundtrack (Personally? Original ANY. DAY. And that's not some nostalgia bs, it's just so much more organic, raw and soulful really) and with the help of modders only 2 hours after release you can now play with Japanese voices w/ English subtitles!\n\nI've had one of the roughest weeks in a long time and this release came out of nowhere, I couldn't believe it, amazingly though this game managed to just let me kick back, relax and feeling like a huge weight was lifted over my shoulders.

It's HD re-release certainly looks good, but does the gameplay of X and X-2 still hold up?\nFFX is #1 in the gaming history :)\n\nI thought this Remaster was a huge upgrade to the original PS2 version (which is the only version prior to this I had played) and was a welcome walk down memory lane into one of FF's more touching titles. FFX has always had this depressing effect on me but it an ok way, it is just the amazing music blending in with the lovable characters and the feeling that something bad is going to happen to one of your beloved heroes.... Its a powerful feeling. The music is without a doubt top notch and manages to capture the moments both happy and sad (especially sad) and really make players feel the drama. FFX was also the 1st FF to have character dialogue and is looked upon by most as a milestone in FF history. And it surprised me just how attached I could get on my 8th play through. It brought me back years so long ago, when I was playing FFX on my PS2 when life was easy and carefree!! FFX-2 is an awesome game in its own right but doesn't hold a light to FFX as X-2 comes off as a far less serious and playful version of FFX. There is literally SO much content in between FFX & FFX-2 and its all on steam now. It is such a great deal for this HD Remaster for $30.00 / 20€ or however much you end up paying, its well worth it. There is over 100 hours of content in between the 2 (actually if your like me well more than that) but I recommend this to anyone who likes Final Fantasy of course, but also to fans who have played the older version. The graphic enhancements are stunning and are easily noted.  Also, ANY fan of RPG who doesn't own this should get it now. Beautiful story, amazing music, heartfelt characters & a sad life of the people of Spira. Its well worth it!!","May 12","true","46.2"," 81 of 109 people (74%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","74","81","109","9","4"

It took me almost five years to finish the game on the PS2 back then (because I was that bad, and I played off and on). And when I finally did, I cried. The story had completely tugged and caressed my poor heart, and the characters had become like real friends to me. FFX is definitely the game that inspired me to begin my long journey as a gamer, and more importantly a Final Fantasy fanboy.\n\nThe minute I saw FFX/X-2 HD Remaster on Steam, I bought it in a heartbeat. I just finished the main storyline of FFX again, which is probably my second full play-through ever, and my first in about six years. As an adult, and as someone who already knew the plot, I thought that I would be able to hold back my emotions this time around.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nI wept and wept and wept. Choking on tears, I barely managed to watch the last cutscene. Bittersweet feelings and powerful music coupled with nostalgia, this game has brought me more entertainment, enjoyment, and heartwarm than any movie or game that I've ever watched or played, without exaggeration.\n\nSeriously, if you haven't played FFX yet, then I highly recommend you play it now. The graphics and whatnot of the HD Remaster are not too shabby. And if you have played it, then... Why not play it again? I promise, the second time brings back so many more teary smiles than the first.\n\nI haven't played FFX-2 yet, but I have high hopes. But even if FFX-2 is as bad as fans claim it to be, the fact that it's a sequel to FFX earns an automatic positive in my books.\n\nI wish you all a pleasant pilgrimage through Spira.\n\nEDIT: Clarity","May 17","true","80.2"," 49 of 59 people (83%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","83","49","59","5","4"

If and when my impressions change in the future, as I progress in Final Fantasy X and move on to Final Fantasy X-2, I'll make sure to update this review to reflect that.\n\nSo far, the game feels exactly like I remembered it, for better and worse, and by "worse", I specifically mean one issue in particular - the camera movement and control. This issue annoyed me whenever I was playing the original Playstation 2 version, and it keeps annoying me now, with this version as well. It might annoy me now even more, as I've become more spoiled, as I got used to being in near-complete control of the camera. In this game, however, unless I'm missing something, the camera movement is automatic, limited and uncomfortable. If there's a way to change that, I'm yet to figure out how.\n\nOther than that, the game is very close to my personal, subjective idea of perfection. The story is great, combining both fantasy and science-fiction elements, alongside old-fashioned yet dark drama in a long ongoing adventure. The battle system offers a great balance - it's deep and interesting on one hand, and easy enough to learn on the other. The sphere-grid seems, even today, like a refreshing and unique twist on the standard character progression system. While at first the game feels linear and limiting, I can tell you that at a certain point, you get all the freedom you want when it comes to exploration, side quests. weapon customization and so on.\n\nAdd to that the updated graphics (Full HD at 1080p on widescreen) and soundtrack (including arranged versions) on a stable version of the game, and as far as I'm concerned, this is as good as it gets. The game looks, sounds and feels great, much better than I expected.\n\nWhether you played Final Fantasy X before and liked it or like role playing games and never got to play it - this is your chance to play a modern version of one of the true RPG gems ever made.","May 18","true","106.8"," 29 of 34 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","29","34","0","6"

I could not stop playing, the game and story is still a lot better than most that have been released in the last 10 years, and the remastered version is the icing on the cake. Not had a single issue with the game since release, over 50 hours played and still around another 50 to go, if you looking for a quick and easy game to finish this is not for you, but if you want a game that is epic in all proportions look no further.

The game is as I remembered it except in HD. Images are very sharp and consistent throughtout the game unlike FFIX. It is definately one of my top 10 most value for money games I've played (hrs played vs cost). It is also the first final fantasy game I've completed... never quite ever finished VIII.\n\nThe game does for some reason show all the options in Japanese when you first go to the settings in the main menu. (This might only be the case if you are in Asia) You'll probably have to pull down one or two of the drop down menus before you find the option to change to English if you can not read Japanese Kanji.\n\nController support was a bit weird as I use a PS4 controller and the action and cancel buttons are reversed if memory serves me right so I had to fiddle around with re configuring that... The game assumes you are using an X-box controller if you had one plugged in... No real issues with using a controller thus far except the Jecth Shot memory challenge which seems slightly unresponsive..\n\nOther than that... bye bye another 400 hours","May 14","true","56.4"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","17","17","3","1"

Even though the voice acting is a little weak(HA-HA-HA-HA scene...) you fall in love with the characters and share some truely heart-wrenching moments. The main antagonist is a massive monster named Sin that appears in Spira to punish the world for using "machina". To beat Sin a "Summoner" must fight him with his/her followers every time he re-appears. Along the way you will deal with marriages, undead monster birds, Final Fantasy classics like Biggs, Wedge and Cid, Movie spheres, a complete new language to learn and much much more!\n\nIf story doesn't draw you in, gameplay should, there is a huuuuge and complex levelling system called "the sphere grid" using it you can tailor your gameplay how you like by upgrading skills such as the FF classics like Fire, Fira, Firaga. Using the advanced grid you can "mix and match" and make the ultimate all powerful character.\n\nThere are so many collectibles, I don't even know where to begin.

This game, however, is miles better.\n\nFirst, just to get it out of the way, yes this is capped at 30 FPS. But no, it does not affect the game at all. I was worried about that as well but the 30 fps is so consistant that it never takes you out of the game. All the game logic must be tied to the framerate because they did EVERYTHING else right.\n\nThere are a ton of graphics options. Everything you would want is there and the game looks amazing for what it is.\n\nThe game comes with every single extra you could possibly want. All of the international content from both games including the audio drama (even if it sucks).\n\nLet me just end by saying they even included controller rumble in this port. None of the XIII games supported it. So that should give you a good idea about how they treated this game.\n\nAs far as Final Fantasy X goes, it's an amazing game. It's even better than I remembered it from all those years ago. If you like RPGs at all really, you owe it to yourself to give this a go. You can even get it for 18 bucks if you look around a bit.\n\nI give it a 9/10.

This port has to be the most stable on PC, only 1 crash (in FFX-2 i might add) in 56 hours. You get decent amount of tweak-able graphics options and although it doesn't look current gen, the polish they added to the textures really make the game look as it did when it was first released, if you know what I mean.\n\nIt is locked to 30fps, but you wont really notice it for the most part, since it isn't a twitch shooter. I know that will bother most people, but you are really screwing yourself out of a classic jrpg if you let that be a deciding factor in your purchase for this collection.\n\nFF-X2, I hated it at first, never had the chance to play it back in the days of the ps2 era, I was disappointed in the direction they decided to go in terms of the games atmosphere and tone, but if you can get past the cringe inducing awkwardness of certain sections of the game there is some gold to be found. Haven't completed it yet, but there is somewhat of a decent plot, and there are some serious story driven moments, but right after it just gets nullified by OTT campy humour.\n\nThe battle system was something I didn't take to at first either, the mix of real-time and turn based combat didn't gel with me and was quite confusing at first, especially how claustrophobic the camera seems to make me feel when there are your 3 party members and 4 enemies scattered around a tiny battle map. With characters/enemies or the angle of the camera skewing your LOS on the action. But it does add an element of tension in battles, and makes for way more exciting gameplay.\n\nOne thing that let's it done tremendously though is that the only way you can reduce damage from attacks (like when you are low hp) is if you pick the warrior class, and also if one or two of your characters goes down it can be impossible to revive them and keep them alive due to needing the bar to fill up before you can use and item, and then further waiting time to actually USE THE ITEM. Making a simple phoenix down and potion combo a pain in the ♥♥♥, due to an enemy constantly trying to kill the character you are constantly reviving.\n\nScenario : Yuna on low hp, she is a gunner, she cant “defend” to reduce damage, Paine's action bar has filled up and you decide to use a potion to heal yuna, during the 5 seconds it takes for Paine to rummage around to find the potion, Yuna gets hit and is KO'd, Paine finds the potion and now decides to heal herself. You then try to use a phoenix down, after 10 seconds, you successfully revive Yuna, fiend/boss attacks Yuna again, she gets KO'd, rinse repeat.\n\nDon't listen or jump on the internet hate band wagon for ffx-2, some bad design decisions/tone etc do make the haters complaints justified, and it is not necessarily a great game or even a good one, but there are moments in it that make the game worthwhile to play through, and I can't wait to see how the story progresses.\n\nAll in all, a wonderful job from Square Enix (never thought I could say that about Enix xD), a fully functioning port that just gets the nostalgia flowing. Will be playing this now for years to come. Thank you!","May 30","true","60.5"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","12","12","0","2"

It is hard to believe the game was released so long ago, it easily competes with modern AAA games and is a good price in my opinion.\n\nThe story is very engaging and character development is great. The English voices are really not as bad as people say, I admit the timing in parts is bad, but the voices grow on you and you'll learn to love them.\n\nThere is so much to do outside of the story too, lots of places to explore, new and old. Plenty of optional bosses and various activities such as Blitzball and the Monster Arena.\n\nThere are in built cheats/boosts to make the game a breeze if you'd rather focus on story and not the optional encounters. I personally have not used them as it takes away the fun for me as I love the battles.\n\nI am excited to go into FFX-2 blind after all these years. But this is worth it just for FFX.\n\nThank you for reading, feel free to comment or add me if you have any questions :)","May 26","true","57.9"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

You needn't worry. It is unfortunately locked at 30fps, but at least it's a rock solid 30.\nThe HD remaster includes some very handy options which can be easily toggled on and off using F1, F2, etc. Things like speeding up the game by x2 and x4 and upping the enemy encounter rate (or turning it off outright) which is VERY handy for grinding.\n\nIf you've never played FFX before, it's a great game. One of the last bastions of intriguing plots and lovable, human feeling characters before the Final Fantasy team decided to get their fashion designers to do the writing from now on. And the Sphere Grid is simply one of the coolest character progression systems in any RPG ever!\nFFX-2 is kind of a joke. I don't mean it isn't enjoyable, I mean it's often held that it was made as a little bit of a joke. A lot of people don't even consider it in their head-canon, and it's a bit exhausting being that it's constructed mostly from reused environments and assets from FFX.","May 16","true","76.7"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","15","19","0","0"

Even so, if you're a newbie to this game, here's a bit of information for you.. You've got a great cast of characters, all voiced, along with an enthralling story and amazing summons. At the time this game came out, the CGIs were amazing. There was nothing like it. And  voiced games weren't that common at the time. Also, the way the character's facial expressions changed to show their emotions was  revolutionary. Actually, now when I think about it, FFX did a lot of things first, which changed the way how a lot of people looked at games. I dont think you'd have such great and believeable characters in later games such as The Last of Us and Heavy Rain if FFX never came out. It truly was the game which forced the gaming industry to evolve beyond the ps1 era.\n\nLooking at port quality, I really have to say that unlike a lot of their previous ports, they did a very good job with this one. You get the upgraded graphics of the PS4 version, all the international version content, original and arranged soundtracks, eternal calm, last mission, and probably even more that I'm forgetting. Oh, did I mention boosters? You can turn off enemy encounters, turn on turbo, have all basic items, get max gil, etc. Great option for people who dont have much time playing games, or those who have already beaten this game multiple times. Or well...those who just want to cheese..\n\nNow, to be fair, it does have a 30 FPS lock, but so did the original. I've seen people be very vocal about this lock but in all honestly, if you're used to how the original plays, this shouldn't bother you. If it's still an issue for you, there's a mod coming out in a few months I heard which changes the game's framerate to 60, so you'd have to be patient for that.\n\nAll in all, if you, like me, havent played this title in ages and itching for a new FF game to replay or just want to experience  it for the first time, this is a very good version of the game to get into.","May 18","true","100.3"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

Now, replaying it in HD glory is a huge nostalgia hit. The score (both revised, and original) is outstanding. The story is deep, rich, and an emotional journey for both the characters and the player. The gameplay may seem tedious to those that don't find RPGs appealing, but many will be love it. If not the animations and art style, simply fly through a battle and take in the music. Even now I have the menu in the background for the music alone. Added 'cheat' features give replayability, and something to mess with if you get bored. The graphics have (obviously) been redone to look good, but it doesn't lose the feel of the original.\n\nFinal Fantasy X alone is worth the full price. If you've played the original, you'll love going back. If not, you're in for an incredible journey. However, you also get Final Fantasy X-2...\n\nWhile not as good as Final Fantasy X, FFX2 is still a very enjoyable game. The score is once again brilliant, the cutscenes breathtaking, and it gives closure to the story. The gameplay and RPG elements are different, but fun to play with and experiment. It's a nice balance of difficulty too.\n\nKeep an eye out for cutscenes in both FFX & FFX2 then glue your finger to the screenshot button, trust me.","May 15","true","42.5"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

This game was so good in its original form, and when I heard about a remaster, I had to buy it on Vita, and eventually I came into contact with a PS3, so I bought the game on there as well.

There is nothing wrong with the rearrangement, but if you want to put your nostalgia goggles on, the original soundtrack is the way to go.\n2. Cheats.  Item grinding in this game is a b****.  Having 99 Doors to Tomorrow to grind for all the optional bosses helps a ton.  It also doesn't disable achievements, which I found odd. No complaints here though.\n3.  Graphical options. Make your retinas bleed with a glorified PS2 title.  Always a plus.\nI haven't played FFX-2 yet, but it is a great title in its original form, so I have full confidence in it.\n\nA few minor bugaboos I have:\n1.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/silverwhite/recommended/359870/","silverwhite","Evranu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/silverwhite/","669 products in account","I played Final Fantasy X for the first time when I was around 13 years old. I loved it back then because of all of its charm, starting with the beautiful and memorable music, nice characters and good plot. I have spent so many, many hours on this game on my PS2 and I never imagined that it would be available some day on PC. I am very glad that this day came and now I am able to repeat the experience on my computer. I can recommend this game with all of my heart. I am aware that huge part of my praise is caused because of the nostalgia, but you have to believe me that Final Fantasy X is worth playing.\nIn my opinion the battle system in FFX is one of the best that was used in FF franchise, and the sphere grid system is also very well thought as it allows you to mix abilities as you like. When it comes to the port, I was afraid that it would be ruined, but luckily I was wrong. The game works very well and I have not experienced any problems thus far.\nWhat is more the HD remaster looks very nice and I can't say anything bad about it.\nWhen it comes to me, this game is far better than most of the new FF's, so I will repeat myself to tell you again that I truly recommend it.\n\nAs for the FFX-2, I honestly cannot say that it is a bad game. It may not be as brilliant as FFX, but it is not a total mistake either. Do  I have to add that it also has a very beautiful soundtrack?\n\nTo sum up, I say: go for this game! Discover the beauty within it, experience the beautiful music and help Yuna and others in their quest.\n","June 2","true","6.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FieryLeon/recommended/359870/","FieryLeon","Fli","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FieryLeon/","579 products in account","A good port of a good Final Fantasy game.\nThis review will only cover Final Fantasy X as I haven't tried X-2 yet.\n\nFinal Fantasy X broke the PS1 era mould a little bit by bringing FF back to its traditional turn based roots. I personally think the game is better for it, but objectively it may be a little bit slow for people who are used to the faster ATB system. It also allows you to switch characters freely during battle (with only three active characters at once). The switch system adds an exciting element to the battles, because it feels like you can freely exploilt enemy weaknesses on the fly, and you can use every character instead of only focusing on a few.\n\nAnother way it broke the mould was by removing the traditional level up system and using a level up grid called the Sphere Grid[i.imgur.com](expert grid)[i.imgur.com]. This has both pros and cons but is essentially a more visually stimulating standard level up system. Choice doesn't really play a big role here unless you use the expert grid, but generally you won't be using the expert grid due to issues you have later in the game. The benefits of the sphere grid system lie in the fact that you can see future abilities you will acquire and notice significant power increases after moving for a while on the grid.\n\nThe character balance is fine throughout the main storyline, but there's one character that tends to be weaker than the rest due to the fact that he has no specialisation and feels a few steps behind whoever he decides to tail on the grid. Post game balance is pretty bad with the fact that you'll only use 4/8 of the characters. This is less important as obviously post game content tends to be done with efficiency in mind so players probably won't mind.\n\nIn terms of the writing, the characters are pretty consistently good with a few common anime tropes thrown in. They're all charming though, even if some of the scenes can be a little bit cringey. The writing is good, and the overall plot is actually very interesting. It avoids falling into some of the shonen cliches and the game is definitely better for it. The world is grim and it definitely lets you feel the main themes of the game, which are death and hope.\n\nThe music is top notch with a great leitmotif that they use at the correct times to make you feel the beats of the story more accurately. The theme of the game was a song called "Suteki Da Ne" which I personally don't care for as much as 'Eyes on Me' or 'Melodies of Life'. Not to say that it's bad, I just don't enjoy the singer too much so I find it hard to listen to it as much as the other main FF themes.\n\nOk, here's a quick pros/cons list to finish this review off.\n\nPros:\n\n+ Interesting plot, good writing, great music and quality world building. Standard FF fare.\n+ Tactical combat means that you feel good for beating tough enemies\n+ Standard story is harder than normal FF's, if you're after a challenge this might be for you. (without grinding)\n+ Tons of post game content, that is actually very tough and time consuming.\n\nCons:\n\n- Sphere Grid gives the illusion of choice.\n- Some voice acting is a little bit cringey\n- Animations are a bit... off.\n\nAll in all this is a solid game (and port) that lives up to the FF name superbly, and I would recommend to anyone looking for a great experience.","May 31","true","81.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I completed this game already before with full completion yet I find myself years later playing it all over again and enjoying every moment of it. I was sad when it first was re-released as it was on a system I didn't own. Seeing it on Steam made me squee with delight and purchase it instantly which is a rarity for me.\n\nIf you haven't played this game before I still reccomend every moment of it.\n\nFinal Fantasy X is one of my favorite Final Fantasy stories as well. You might hear people gripe about X-2.... if you accept the fact it's pretty much a girl-power fan service extra bit of gaming after loving X then you will enjoy it. I see a few people saying **** X-2.... it's not nearly as well rounded and it won't draw you in like X.... but I can't say I don't enjoy that game either. I actually really liked that game. It was fun <.< I'm not sure why it gets so much hate... it's just not really connected to X in a deep way.\n\nMy advice for you if you're reading reviews to decide is... yes it's totally worth it just for X... and X-2 is a light-hearted and actually super fun game, if you aren't up your own Final Fantasy fankid bum and can just accept and enjoy it for what it is. It's a fluffy after game and it's fun.\n\nLong live X.... :D","May 13","true","8.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

For this very reason I was really hyped even if I had a PS2 copy beside me for years and, when I finally got to play the remaster, I can only say that it's exactly as I expected it to be: it's a wonderful JRPG that was released in 2001 so it would have been surely limited by the age of the engine regardless of the remaster.\nHonestly I didn't really like being forced to buy X-2 along with X as I probably wouldn't have done it if they were sold separately but in the end I would have happily paid €20 for X alone so it's not really an issue for me.\nAnyway I've almost played it for 30 hours and I'm still at about 40-50% of the first game so I can't do anything but recommend it to every nostalgic player AND to everyone who didn't get to play the most beautiful Final Fantasy ever developed (IMHO).\n\nPros:\n-Fantastic plot;\n-Quite challenging;\n-It takes a lot of hours to complete it at 100%.\n\nCons:\n-Technical limitations due to the age of the game;\n-RNG mechanics can be frustrating;\n-It won't let you do anything else beside playing it.\n\nX-2 is quite crappy but can be a palliative for all the players who got the absolute need of more of X after finishing the first. Honestly I didn't like the change in the mechanics at all and I'll only play it for the plot.","May 23","true","47.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

Solid port with actual graphics options (including ambient occlusion, shadows, textures, anti-aliasing, color correction, yada yada), can choose between original & arranged soundtracks, lots of extras from the international versions (Creature Creator makes X2 play completely different and it has lots of extra job dresspheres making it worth a replay). It's also two games in one for cheap.\n\nCould go indepth about the story (FFX) but there's so much to talk about there :P Very unique post apocalyptic, paranoid religious setting (with lots of eastern influences) that sets it apart from other FF games is one of the main things I dig about it, as well as memorable characters, "doomed" feeling overall plot and fantastic music. X2 is like a wholly different game in terms of story (being MUCH more lighthearted) but with still fun gameplay.\n\nMy only complaint is that it's a whopping 37 gb to download which may be an issue for some.

Underwater polo provides a distraction from the main story, but often you find yourself wishing the characters would hurry up and drown so you have something more interesting to do.\n\nCutscenes are not skippable and do a lot to pad the length of the game. You may find this frustrating as battles with Jabba the Hutt, who is eager to get into Leia's pants, will require you to watch the same 10 minute cutscene multiple times if unsuccessful.\n\nThere is also a sequel that pits Princess Leia as the protagonist along with an utterly forgettable supporting cast, including a goth chick that cuts herself to ease the Paine of being cast as Jarjar Binx. While more of an actual game than underwater polo, most people will probably want to skip the sequel.\n\nAbsolutely nobody will play the dungeon crawler "final mission" sequel to the sequel, no matter how much they like the actual sequel; an exercise in tedium that takes the fun out of dysfunctional.\n\n\nIn the end, you find out that Bruce Willis was dead the whole time and Leonardo Dicaprio eventually wakes up from his dream and makes the sequel's plot even more confusing and pointless.\n\n\nBuy the game for Final Fantasy X, play the fanservice sequel that turns likable characters from the original into total ditzes (where is Anita Sarkeesian when you need her?) if you have got nothing better to do, skip the final mission.","May 20","true","244.5"," 20 of 37 people (54%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","54","20","37","29","6"

Yes it is capped at 30FPS, but that's because when the game was made it was common practice to tie some of the game physics and logic to frame rate. So to raise the cap they'd have to rewrite some code, which as anyone who has ever done any coding knows has a huge cascade effect.\n\nIn other words, yes it's capped, no it's not a big deal, and no it isn't an easy fix for the developer.\n\nOverall very pleased we got a release of this game at all, let alone the excellent performing version we seem to have, and am looking forward to the long hours I'm going to put into this game again.","May 12","true","8.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's like an anti-depressant for me and of course it brings back pleasant memories of the Playstation 2 days but I have been playing Final Fantasy games since the early 90's. It seems to me to be well done so far, I haven't played FFX-2 yet this time around as I couldn't really get into it but  I will try it again eventually. I am very happy with the remaster as far as the graphics and music options are concerned. Most of the gameplay looks incredible but there are a few issues I have noticed it seems that cutscenes have not really been remastered so it is kind of distracting to go from beautiful graphics during gameplay and then take a step backwards while watching them.  I am kind of on the fence about the cheats that are available now with the sphere grid and item inventory and unlocking all abilities. While on one hand it's cool, and I could just not unlock them but the temptation is there I feel it takes away a lot from the game if you choose to unlock them because most of the fun of this game is in the grind to unlock those top level abilities and magic/items. Overall though it seems to be a great job and I am glad it is ported to pc. I would love to see a FF 12 remaster also!","June 5","true","25.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Start the actual game and hit new game and you get the option of standard or expert sphere grids and another option between music before the game even starts. The game starts and you see a BEAUTIFUL remaster of the game; Tidus looks fantastic and the graphics were treated to a AAA upgrade from what I can see; the cutscenes weren’t touch besides the quality and ratio. If first impressions could kill I have a feeling this game would have put a lot of FF fans 6-feet under. I am overly impressed with this game and all I did was turn it on. Oh and almost forgot to mention the game is integrated so well with my PC that I literally hit the home button to type this and the game is still running sound and all meaning I can search Firefox, look through pictures, WINDOW THE GAME, and whatever else I want at any time.

Seriously this game is worth getting just for the arranged music.\n\nLonger version:\n\nGameplay is exactly the same as the PS2 and redone versions for the PS3, PSVita, and PS4. That means turn based combat, sphere grid upgrade, blitzball, and unskippable text cutscenes. If this is your first time with the game you'll get the gist of it from any gameplay video for any of the versions listed above.\n\nMechanic wise, like the other reviews say it's locked to 30 fps. Considering the type of game it is fine. I like the high fps but since it's a port of a game of two generations ago the fact that it even runs at a constant 30 is good enough in my book. I spoke earlier about the music. You're allowed to choose between the new soundtrack or the original. I'll recommend the new one again because it really is beautiful. I haven't tried my ps4 controller on the game, but it has correct button mapping for the Xbox one. I don't own a Steam Controller so I can't test it.\n\nThe textures are "HD." You can tell from the screenshots that they are updated from the original but they don't hold to any of the latest game realeases. Square Enix has always been pretty famous for their cgi scenes so those still look incredible.\n\nThat's pretty much it. Game runs exactly as it does on other platforms so that means it's a good port. Good port means it's a recommended buy. So get it. Just be careful of the infamous laugh scene. Make sure  you're the only one in the room.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow that I've had some time to play X-2, I'll add it to the review.\nControls are the same as described above. Something I didn't think about untill playing through some the start of X-2 is that the games don't allow for keybinding. The originals didn't do it, but I do think that at this stage of video games all PC games should offer the chance to rebind keys, for the keyboard and for a controller if it offers support for them. A lot of games I had to rebind keys to allow for non confusing controls with my PS4 controller, which is why I changed to the Xbox controller. But I digress.\n\nNo redo of the soundtrack for this one. Probably didn't need to. As far as overall sound quality I can't tell much of a difference.\n\nFor gameplay, it is very different to X. It brings back the action gauge that you see in most of the old ones. And as far as the party, there's really just Yuna, Rikku, and Paine. There is a sort of pseudo Pokemon game as in  you can capture monsters and add them to your party. I didn't mess with it much in the original release, and I haven't touched it passed the tutorial.\nThe characters all have access to all the classes, as along as they are installed in their grid. Any adjacent class can then be switched to during battle, same as when you would change out party members in X.\n\nSince the whole fate of the world scenario is solved (spoiler sorry) in X, the tone is much lighter. It's basically a road trip with friends. Which I guess is the premise of XV, except gender swapped.\n\nWell that's that. Keep blitzing, or -- god forbid -- chocobo racing.","May 13","true","100.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

It feels exactly like the original game and even gives you the ability to choose between classic and remastered music for the game!\n\nThings I like:\n- Graphics are great in 1080p, still looks solid!\n- Remastered music captures the beauty of the original soundtrack, but enhances the quality!\n- You can choose classic or remastered version!\n- Fantastic Port! Runs games with no issues so far!\n- Comes in with English and Japanese languages in-case you can't handle the dubbed voices\n- Smoothest 30 fps I have ever seen, no stutters or nothing\n\nThings that are Meh:\n- 30 FPS. I am not an FPS snob, but I know it matters for some people\n\nThe remastered music is a fantastic adition and it does the soundtrack justice! The combat is same as before and its really fun, the visuals are better at 1080p. Framerate is locked at 30fps, but the 30fps is steady and smooth, no framedrops ever, even at high density areas or high particle effect battles.

If someone asks me "What is your favorite game?" My answer will be.. My favorite game is definitely Final Fantasy X. The last time i played this game it was the version of the Playstation 2, Very late i saw the version for the Playstation 4 i was hoping they could finally maybe launch a Final Fantasy X port for Steam they really made it finally.. When i saw this on Steam saying i thinked on that precise moment - I have to buy this right now! So i did it.\n\nAbout this game - It's a great RPG with a really awesome story. It's a love history a great one, it's a type of a game when the end comes the player starts to cry, because it's a very "♥♥♥♥ing" lovely history, I at least cried on the end of this game.\nAbout the soundtrack - Nobuo Uematsu that guy it's a genious the music of this game it's very beautifull this guy.. It's just awesome the music he does..\n\nMy Score 100/10\n\nAbout Final Fantasy X-2 i can't really say that much about that one. I just didn't played until the end to know everything about it.\n\nMy score for what i played - 7,5/10\n\nAbout the game boosters it's good for those who want to end the game faster or just want the game easier to play, I used them just to try them out and for me it's not my type, but maybe it could be useful for some players..\n\nSquare Enix made a really good port and didn't screwed on this game soo.. Thank you Square Enix finally you decided to create a good port <3\n\nJust the music on the start.. Made me cry.. <3\n\nFor those who already played this game let's just cry together for having this finally on Steam :')","May 16","true","4.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Was the first time round and is so now. The only issue I have with it is that they brought it out in the summertime, so I have to lose another 100 hours of vitamin D like I did the last time I played the game in summer '01 lol. The storyline is great as with so many of the FF games, very shakespearian. The HD remaster is realy well done, no bugs that I can see so far. Playing with the original soundtrack option and the expert sphere grid option this time around to give Yuna some BM kick. I'll probably try to play FFX-2 right through this time as well, only made it half way originally as it's a bit on the cheesy side (even more so than FFX...which is cheesy in a good way!).

When I saw it came out remastered on steam I was in work, I immediately made up some family emergency so I could get home and buy it, I then rang in sick for the next week and told my wife where to go... I could not stop playing, the game and story is still a lot better than most that have been released in the last 10 years, and the remastered version is the icing on the cake. Not had a single issue with the game since release, over 50 hours played and still around another 50 to go, if you looking for a quick and easy game to finish this is not for you, but if you want a game that is epic in all proportions look no further. You can easily spend 30 hours just on the mini game BLITZBALL.

Just THIS. This game embodies one of those times when Final Fantasy as a game series shines at its brightest. Final Fantasy X was my first Final Fantasy, and I will never, ever forget the way it blew open my world as a young teenager. They say that your first Final Fantasy is the one that will always be the best - I am so, so deeply thankful that this was my first. (FF VII lovers, sorry, but you'll have to come second.) This fact alone is even more incredible if you think about it as a testament to the quality of the Final Fantasy series, when usually your first anything sucks horse poop. Yeah. Think about it.\n\nAnyways, this remaster basically brushes up the original game just enough so that you get sucked into the world of Spira all over again (in HD!!). Yes, the character models are a little inconsistent, in that the main characters have all gotten South-Korean perfect facelifts more in line with the CG cutscenes, while NPCs at times look like they've been injected with too much Botox with blurry textures for makeup. The infamous HahahaHAHAHAHA scene is still there, in all its cringeworthy glory. Auron's just as cool as ever, Tidus is still whiny, Yuna's prettier than before... Everything is there as you would like to remember it... Yes, even the now kinda outdated stiff character animations.\n\nThe sphere grid upgrade system still holds up after more than a decade - it's incredible how much it makes sense in terms of accessibility and enjoyability, unlike some certain other games (*cough* FF XII *cough*). The game runs smoothly without a hitch on a Geforce card, and is perfectly compatible with an Xbox controller. Oh! And finally, even though the game is locked at 30 fps, I either didn't notice it because everything was so consistent, or I simply didn't have time to care because I was too busy enjoying the game and storyline - again.\n\nFor those of you who've played it before, you know what I'm talking about. For those of you who haven't played it before - You will cringe, you will get the feels, you will laugh, you will cheer on this unlikely group of characters as they take on the world around them. So...What are you waiting for? Everyone's waiting for you. Spira awaits, with all its dreams and splendor and broken glory.  BUY THE GAME. NOW.\n\nFinal Fantasy X-2 review:... Ok, I wasn't really as a much of a fan, but it's still fun. It's not as emotionally heavy as FFX, but if you like seeing women MCs in skimpier clothing and flashing their dance moves... Well. Look, it's not quite a strip club. I promise.","May 17","true","62.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/matthiasfan/recommended/359870/","matthiasfan","ae_greg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/matthiasfan/","238 products in account","Background: I owned the PS2 version of FFX, I own the PS3 HD version, and of course the PC version. I will predominantly speak about FFX, as that is the game I have the most time with. This game was one that I became very attached to while beginning my first year of college (I had played it a little before, but just on and off again before that). Because of this, please realize that I may be biased and looking through glasses of nostalgia!\n\nThe Game Itself: The game is wonderful with a great battle system, a great story, good graphics, great music, and true voice acting for the first time in a Final Fantasy game. The battle system is the standard random encounters found in most FF games but the battle system itself is good and gives quite a bit of flexibility for the player of how to battle. The sphere grid allows wonderful customization for your characters, especially with the "expert grid" activated from the International Version. This was made widely accessible to NA audiences beginning with the PS3 remaster and the PC port follows suit.\n\nThe story is wonderful with a deep and twisting plot to save the land of Spira from a creature named "Sin." The characters are generally deep and their development is wonderful to watch. One can quickly become connected with the different types of personalities and the core of their circumstances.\n\nI thought the graphics were great on the PS2, especially at the time of release. On the PS3, it seems that there were some changes to the character models, particularly the eyes of Tidus. The remaster is well done though for the PS3 with the textures and models being much more detailed. This is carried over to the PC version and looks closer to the PS4 release (from what I have seen in videos).\n\nThe audio is mixed depending on your perspective. The original soundtrack is loved by many, including myself. In the PS3 version, a newer arrangement was added. I think that both have pros and cons, and it may depend entirely on mood as to which one you prefer.\n\nGetting to listen to voice acting in a Final Fantasy game was incredible when this came out. Yes, this game takes a lot of flack for the voice acting, but let us remember that this was a lot of new ground being broken for this franchise. I don't have any problems with the voice acting and, while cheesy at times, gives character to the game (or maybe these are my nostalgia glasses I'm looking through!).\n\nPC Port: From what I have experienced so far with the PC port, I am beyond happy. Yes, it is locked at 30 FPS, but I have no need for anything higher on a turned based RPG. If they release the ability to go 60 FPS, that would be great too!\n\nI use a controller for this game on my PC and everything works fine.\n\nThe PC has the ability to switch between the original music and the rearranged version. You are not stuck as to which one will play, so again, it depends on your mood, I think.\n\nThere are some "helps" that one can use which. These include things like turning off random encounters; speeding up the game, etc. I think that this is a great feature that people can use, particularly if they are in it primarily for the story. The fact that these were added makes me think that Square had in mind those that have played this game before and just want to re-experience it.\n\nOverall: I think this is a great addition to the PC library. If you are coming from the PS2 version, I really recommend this. If you already bought the PS3 version or the PS4 version, I think it is still great to have on PC, but it may not be as enticing.\n\nI recommend this and I would give it a 9.5/10.","May 19","true","6.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There is the issue that it's capped at 30 FPS but for this game that's fine. Sure 60 would of been nice but really it's not really a complaint at all and it's very stable and runs fluidly.\n\nFFX is a must play. If you never played this game due to never owning the consoles that it was released on or for whatever reason, you have to experience it and I feel the Steam version is the best version and I've played the PS4 version but the small extras do make it worth it.\n\nThe gameplay is very good and reminds me of a time when Final Fantasy wasn't heavily relient on auto battle, it does stand the test of time and with the remastered version you are able to chose between two different sphere grids and the expert grid does make it more interesting and make it nice to explore with your characters and customize them to your liking.\n\nAll and all, if you never played it then I'd give it a shot.

An amazing adventure, and in my opinion the best of the Final Fantasy series. Some of the moments in this game just...stayed with me, for years. Final Fantasy X features Tidus, a blitzball player from a futuristic city called Zanarkand. His life changes forever when a mysterious force called Sin sends him 1000 years into the future.\n\nThe port itself works beautifully, bringing a PS2 game flawlessly to computer with smooth 60 FPS and and the remaster looks so much better on a good graphics card than it ever did on PS3/Vita. The arranged chorus is a great revamp on the classic music of this game,  but if it's your first time playing you should choose the original music.\n\nIt works with Steam Link and Steam Controller, but the controller doesn't work out of the box so you'll need to do some tinkering to get it to work. Also, the game itself defaults to Japanese, which is a bit annoying. You'll want to change the settings in the launcher before you start the game.\n\nIf you have any interest in RPGs or Final Fantasy, you NEED to play this game.","May 14","true","15.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I didn't get the ps4 remaster due to some rumormill talk about the remastered edition coming to the pc. Low and behold, it has.\n\nFirst off, for those of you who don't know, this game is a remaster of the international X and X-2 due to the fact that more content was released on those versions.\nAt the start of a new game with X you have the option to chose the Standard Sphere Grid, which all of us here in the America's grew up with. Then you have a second option to chose. Expert, which let's you pick where you want your characters to start out at in the sphere grid, rather than having everyone on their own set path.\nFor example, you could make Tidus the White Mage(healer), Yuna the Tank, Kimari the Black Mage, and so on. So if you ever felt that a character had a more fitting role as something else, or you just want to balance each character a little better, or you just want to say ♥♥♥♥ it and just mess around by giving everyone random rolls, you can in the Expert Sphere Grid Version.\nAnother option has been added, besides the adjustable graphics, you can give yourself all of the consumable items and max gill. That's pretty usefull if you just want to try and speed run this game. It doesn't give you any of the Al Bhed primers or any other Key Items, so you don't need to worry about the game locking up on you at a certain point should you chose to use those options.\n\nPros:\nAdjustable Graphic settings that can go as high as your set up can support\n\nAmazing remaster\n\nBeautiful Sound Track\n\nGreat Nostalgia Trip\n\n\nCons:\n\nLocked at 30 fps\n\nNo Japanese Audio\n\nIlluminati\n\n\n8/10\nwood nostalg again","May 24","true","65.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Only the soundtrack itself means a lot.\nSpeaking about the game itself is one of the Final Fantasy together with the 7 and the 9 (maybe) that even a pc gamer should know and play. The adventure is great, so are the minigames (blitzball addict!) and the plot itself. Combat is turn based and is well defined and never so hard. A particularity of this game is the levelling system, based on a "sphereoghrapy" where you decide where to focus you characters (even if following the standard route is probably the best choice until midgame at least).\n7 Characters means a loot of deepness and possibilities in each combat.\n\nThe only bad thing is the framerate stuck at 30 fps, it might look a little "slow" compared to an average pc game. They just kept the original framerate. Some also complained about the huge amount of cut scenes and dialouge, but to me this is what build the plot of the game into its perfection together with the soundtrack.\n\nTHIS GAME SOLD 8 MILLION COPIES WORLDWIDE, 4 million only on ps2, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU WAITING FOR?","May 25","true","39.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Just THIS. This game embodies one of those times when Final Fantasy as a game series shines at its brightest. Final Fantasy X was my first Final Fantasy, and I will never, ever forget the way it blew open my world as a young teenager. They say that your first Final Fantasy is the one that will always be the best - I am so, so deeply thankful that this was my first. (FF VII lovers, sorry, but you'll have to come second.) This fact alone is even more incredible if you think about it as a testament to the quality of the Final Fantasy series, when usually your first anything sucks horse poop. Yeah. Think about it.\n\nAnyways, this remaster basically brushes up the original game just enough so that you get sucked into the world of Spira all over again (in HD!!). Yes, the character models are a little inconsistent, in that the main characters have all gotten South-Korean perfect facelifts more in line with the CG cutscenes, while NPCs at times look like they've been injected with too much Botox with blurry textures for makeup. The infamous HahahaHAHAHAHA scene is still there, in all its cringeworthy glory. Auron's just as cool as ever, Tidus is still whiny, Yuna's prettier than before... Everything is there as you would like to remember it... Yes, even the now kinda outdated stiff character animations.\n\nThe sphere grid upgrade system still holds up after more than a decade - it's incredible how much it makes sense in terms of accessibility and enjoyability, unlike some certain other games (*cough* FF XII *cough*). The game runs smoothly without a hitch on a Geforce card, and is perfectly compatible with an Xbox controller. Oh! And finally, even though the game is locked at 30 fps, I either didn't notice it because everything was so consistent, or I simply didn't have time to care because I was too busy enjoying the game and storyline - again.\n\nFor those of you who've played it before, you know what I'm talking about. For those of you who haven't played it before - You will cringe, you will get the feels, you will laugh, you will cheer on this unlikely group of characters as they take on the world around them. So...What are you waiting for? Everyone's waiting for you. Spira awaits, with all its dreams and splendor and broken glory.  BUY THE GAME. NOW.\n\nFinal Fantasy X-2 review:... Ok, I wasn't really as a much of a fan, but it's still fun. It's not as emotionally heavy as FFX, but if you like seeing women MCs in skimpier clothing and flashing their dance moves... Well. Look, it's not quite a strip club. I promise.","May 17","true","62.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have been mostly re-playing X. I am guessing that with the efforts they put into X, X-2 will be just as good.  I played both back in the day on PS2.  I never got far into X-2 but I remember loving X.  I was seriously thinking of getting the console remasters but then there was a rumor it would come to steam.  I waited just to be safe and by the light, here it is.  First off, despite being an older game, it looks surprisingly well remastered.  The character models are good all things considered.  Yeah some of the old NPCS in towns look a lil rough but everything else looks pretty good.  I wouldn't have wanted them to change much anyways because it was such a good game naturally.  I recommend it to anyone that loved the original and want to keep it in their collection.  I have so much appreciation for Square for porting some of these classics over to PC so we can play them still.  I know some of the ports have came out rough but X is not one of them.\n\nPS, Square head haunchos, if you are reading this, please consider porting over some of your non-Final Fantasy franchises as well.

Even back in 2002 (FFX) with it's PS2 release the game was graphically a leap forward and the story was something anyone half into any RPG games could easily follow and fall in love with.

I am a few hours into the game and have not experienced even one glitch ( Win7 64 pro/Radeon R9 270x.) It seems they did everything right with this PC version. The graphics are obviously better while being faithful to the original game and I love the optional arranged soundtrack. I have never played X-2 or the add-on content so that's a huge bonus for me.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/matthiasfan/recommended/359870/","matthiasfan","ae_greg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/matthiasfan/","238 products in account","Background: I owned the PS2 version of FFX, I own the PS3 HD version, and of course the PC version. I will predominantly speak about FFX, as that is the game I have the most time with. This game was one that I became very attached to while beginning my first year of college (I had played it a little before, but just on and off again before that). Because of this, please realize that I may be biased and looking through glasses of nostalgia!\n\nThe Game Itself: The game is wonderful with a great battle system, a great story, good graphics, great music, and true voice acting for the first time in a Final Fantasy game. The battle system is the standard random encounters found in most FF games but the battle system itself is good and gives quite a bit of flexibility for the player of how to battle. The sphere grid allows wonderful customization for your characters, especially with the "expert grid" activated from the International Version. This was made widely accessible to NA audiences beginning with the PS3 remaster and the PC port follows suit.\n\nThe story is wonderful with a deep and twisting plot to save the land of Spira from a creature named "Sin." The characters are generally deep and their development is wonderful to watch. One can quickly become connected with the different types of personalities and the core of their circumstances.\n\nI thought the graphics were great on the PS2, especially at the time of release. On the PS3, it seems that there were some changes to the character models, particularly the eyes of Tidus. The remaster is well done though for the PS3 with the textures and models being much more detailed. This is carried over to the PC version and looks closer to the PS4 release (from what I have seen in videos).\n\nThe audio is mixed depending on your perspective. The original soundtrack is loved by many, including myself. In the PS3 version, a newer arrangement was added. I think that both have pros and cons, and it may depend entirely on mood as to which one you prefer.\n\nGetting to listen to voice acting in a Final Fantasy game was incredible when this came out. Yes, this game takes a lot of flack for the voice acting, but let us remember that this was a lot of new ground being broken for this franchise. I don't have any problems with the voice acting and, while cheesy at times, gives character to the game (or maybe these are my nostalgia glasses I'm looking through!).\n\nPC Port: From what I have experienced so far with the PC port, I am beyond happy. Yes, it is locked at 30 FPS, but I have no need for anything higher on a turned based RPG. If they release the ability to go 60 FPS, that would be great too!\n\nI use a controller for this game on my PC and everything works fine.\n\nThe PC has the ability to switch between the original music and the rearranged version. You are not stuck as to which one will play, so again, it depends on your mood, I think.\n\nThere are some "helps" that one can use which. These include things like turning off random encounters; speeding up the game, etc. I think that this is a great feature that people can use, particularly if they are in it primarily for the story. The fact that these were added makes me think that Square had in mind those that have played this game before and just want to re-experience it.\n\nOverall: I think this is a great addition to the PC library. If you are coming from the PS2 version, I really recommend this. If you already bought the PS3 version or the PS4 version, I think it is still great to have on PC, but it may not be as enticing.\n\nI recommend this and I would give it a 9.5/10.","May 19","true","6.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A lot of key scenes stuck with me and over the years I've wished to play this game again (seriously, i thought about buying it for my PS2 and hooking that up again) and when Square Enix started coming out with these remastered Final Fantasies I got really excited .... I couldn't wait for FFX to come out! I would have bought this if it was 59.99 to be honest.. I love this game so much. I bought the remastered versions for PS3 and PS4 just today too... lol but anyway...\nIt's awesome that this is cheap AND comes with two games. If you've never played Final Fantasy but love these types of games, its an awesome deal!\n\nSince you're a newbie too they added some dope stuff like:\nif you get tired from going point A to point B, just turn on X2 or X4\nif you want to battle HELLA fiends (really, its every 2 steps) just turn the option\nif you DONT want to battle fiends AT ALL you could just turn on that option too!\nyou could turn off HUD for screenshots\nif you want to just do drive attacks you could turn that option on so you have it on every turn\nif you want to get XP but dont want to battle you could just set it on auto battle mode\nthere's built in cheats to get : max money, all items, and all abilities in the game\n\nThe only poo poo thing is that some bosses are optional so i ended up missing/forgetting them on my playthrough lol but whatever.

Especially if we're comparing to XIII and XIII-2 (which I still enjoy). Graphically, it looks amazing, even at 1366x768. As added bonuses, exclusive to this version, are "Boosters". These toggles allow for 2x/4x speed (great for traveling far quickly without a chocobo), "Supercharge" is good as well, which charges your character's overdrive meters each turn and heals them periodically. "More Encounters/No Encounters" is self-explanatory enough, you are able to control the game's random encounter rate to help with grinding or avoiding needless battles. An "Auto-Battle" feature has also been added to have an AI control your characters in battle. Though this usually limits them to basic attacks, no magic or items. "Hide HUD" does was it says as well. Next, is the "cheats" that work similar to a trainer program. Enabling these can Max out your character's skills, Gil, and give you 99 of all items in the game, excluding Key/Mission Items. The game is locked at 30 FPS which apparently bothers people. Doesn't bother me since this is exactly how it was on the PS2/3/4/Vita, so I have no reason to expect more. FFX-2 is relatively stable as well, other than a strange bug that happens when attempting to pause using the keyboard, the game crashes entirely. Pausing with a controller works fine. Just don't play X-2 with keyboard controls and you'll be fine.","May 20","true","103.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Best story of any other FF game.\n\nI've had no crashing problems like others have said (using windows 10), but I have had a substantial audio bug. Everytime I open the game the audio is different, despite none of the settings having changed, and I've looked around and no one else seems to be having this issue. It's frustrating, I either wait until the game loads to put my headset on, or I get my ears blown off. Then again, I could put the headset on and hear nothing and have to crank it way up to hear. It's very odd.\n\nDespite that I'd still recommend this game. X-2 story isnt as good, but it's the first FF game where SE introduced the active time battle system style of gameplay, and moved away from turn based, which makes it so you have to think on your feet of risk wiping your party, The dress sphere system is pretty fun to play around with aswell, you can switch classes in battle, and switching between all the classes you have equipped can sometimes give amazing bonuses to your stats. People tend to hate on X-2 a lot for what it did to the story, but honestly, it's pretty good if you give it a chance.\n\nTL;DR, just buy it.","May 20","true","33.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Being relatively new to the Final Fantasy series and having only played the modern FF 13 series, FFX hd was an amazing and a much more superior experience. For a game that originally came out in 2002, it offers a fantastic story with well written characters that you really care for and has some heartbreaking moments, especially the ending scenes which almost made me cry. In regards to the game mechanics, there is a turn based battle system and each character has their own sphere grid, which you can upgrade as you progress through the game defeating monsters and bosses. There is no excessive need for grinding like in other jrpgs, which is less frustrating.\n\nThere is plenty of content to do in this game, i have only finished the main story and havent done any optional areas and bosses. In addition, a mod makes you play the game with Japanese voices and English subtitles, which i thought was pretty cool and really added to the immersion. The soundtrack in this game is also phenomenal with some standout battle themes and there is also an option to switch between the original and remastered OST whenver you want. The only negative i can think of right now is the lack of a cutscene skip option, which was sometimes very annoying, having to go through  a lengthy cutscene whenever you die at certain bosses. If you are a JRPG fan, i wholeheartedly recommend this game at the normal price, since you get both FFX and X-2, even better when you get it on sale.","May 20","true","56.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its graphics are pretty decent (even today they could be much worse), and its gameplay is fun, following a similar pattern of turn-based combat as its predecessors. Its story isn't my favourite FF story, but it is still pretty damn good. It also has plenty of difficult challenges, such as the optional bosses later on (good luck beating them without cheating - you're going to need a lot of time to do a lot of farming). It does have a few flaws, like the Tidus laughing scene, but overall, it's a pretty fun game with a pretty immersive story. It also has a fun time-killer in the form of Blitzball, a fictional sport within the world of Spira. With recruitable players around the game's world, it can be fun to play in Blitzball tounraments and leagues.\n\nFinal Fantasy X-2 however... I don't have fond memories of this one. The storyline is a bit ♥♥♥♥ in all honesty. It's not the worst mind you, but a few important things that FFX establishes get u-turned in FFX-2, including what makes the ending of FFX so touching (that just makes me feel that Square didn't feel fully committed to the ending they chose for FFX). The gameplay is also an issue in my opinion (you might like it of course, it's a kind of love it or hate it thing). Instead of keeping with the tradition of meeting multiple characters throughout the game, you are restricted to the three characters you start with. Obviously, it can be hard for a JRPG to give only three characters all of the abilities of what would usually spread across seven or eight of them. The way that FFX-2 gets around this is through dress spheres, a mechanic that lets you change your outfit mid-battle to use different abilities. Whilst this is a take on the classic job changing system of III and V, unlike those games, it is poorly implemented here. It kind of takes you out of the game when half of it is spent playing dress-up. A lot of Final Fantasy fans would say that FFX-2 is one of, if not the worst Final Fantasy game in existence due to its story and gameplay, which is a shame as it is the sequal to a decent game.\n\nOverall, this is worth it just for the first game, but while you're at it, you may as well give the second one a go. It's not everyone's cup of tea (I guess you could call it an acquired taste), but if you have it, you may as well see if you like it or not for yourself.","May 16","true","57.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mexikun/recommended/359870/","mexikun","Raum","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mexikun/","248 products in account","Regarding the port, it is great. The games are locked to 30 FPS, but this is because of the fact that the game is so old and many engine things are tied to FPS. There are built-in cheats like speed-up, encounter rate modification, invincible characters, and more that don't seem to break achievements. The games work great and are separated by a relatively non-intrusive launcher. For a pair of games that I never thought would get ported to PC, I'm really happy with the port. It really couldn't be very much better than it is.\n\nRegarding the games, if you haven't played either of them before they might be a bit strange.\n\nFFX is a much more serious game than FFX-2, but the story is a victim of an awkward translation and mediocre voice acting. Although the acting itself isn't necessarily bad, it is evident that none of the lines were recorded together and things feel really disjointed. As a result, the story can get a bit cloudy at times, but it still packs an emotional punch at the right moments.\n\nThe gameplay is a bit slow for modern standards, and there's a lot of waiting for animations or just walking long distances. The speed-up cheat can be a godsend through some parts that need grinding and when you're traversing a huge empty map. If you're patient though, FFX is a great game.\n\nFFX-2 somehow takes the story from the first game and turns a bunch of the characters into pop stars. It is a really weird game and kind of continues the story of FFX, if you're really intrigued, but the gameplay is what will really keep you going through this one. The job system and combat systems are both really fun, and I'm kind of sad they haven't made a good appearance since then.\n\nThis is a great compilation if you want to replay these games. For people playing for the first time, be warned that they are not quite timeless, and instead have some really glaring age-related problems.","May 21","true","43.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This remaster brings back so many memories. The nostalgia factor in itself is worth it to me. I would definately recommend it for anyone that enjoyed it on the PS2. The game pad support is wonderful as well. It also has an auto save feature which I really enjoy, but you can turn it off, if you so desire.","May 14","true","7.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its graphics are pretty decent (even today they could be much worse), and its gameplay is fun, following a similar pattern of turn-based combat as its predecessors. Its story isn't my favourite FF story, but it is still pretty damn good. It also has plenty of difficult challenges, such as the optional bosses later on (good luck beating them without cheating - you're going to need a lot of time to do a lot of farming). It does have a few flaws, like the Tidus laughing scene, but overall, it's a pretty fun game with a pretty immersive story. It also has a fun time-killer in the form of Blitzball, a fictional sport within the world of Spira. With recruitable players around the game's world, it can be fun to play in Blitzball tounraments and leagues.\n\nFinal Fantasy X-2 however... I don't have fond memories of this one. The storyline is a bit ♥♥♥♥ in all honesty. It's not the worst mind you, but a few important things that FFX establishes get u-turned in FFX-2, including what makes the ending of FFX so touching (that just makes me feel that Square didn't feel fully committed to the ending they chose for FFX). The gameplay is also an issue in my opinion (you might like it of course, it's a kind of love it or hate it thing). Instead of keeping with the tradition of meeting multiple characters throughout the game, you are restricted to the three characters you start with. Obviously, it can be hard for a JRPG to give only three characters all of the abilities of what would usually spread across seven or eight of them. The way that FFX-2 gets around this is through dress spheres, a mechanic that lets you change your outfit mid-battle to use different abilities. Whilst this is a take on the classic job changing system of III and V, unlike those games, it is poorly implemented here. It kind of takes you out of the game when half of it is spent playing dress-up. A lot of Final Fantasy fans would say that FFX-2 is one of, if not the worst Final Fantasy game in existence due to its story and gameplay, which is a shame as it is the sequal to a decent game.\n\nOverall, this is worth it just for the first game, but while you're at it, you may as well give the second one a go. It's not everyone's cup of tea (I guess you could call it an acquired taste), but if you have it, you may as well see if you like it or not for yourself.","May 16","true","57.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I didn't get the ps4 remaster due to some rumormill talk about the remastered edition coming to the pc. Low and behold, it has.\n\nFirst off, for those of you who don't know, this game is a remaster of the international X and X-2 due to the fact that more content was released on those versions.\nAt the start of a new game with X you have the option to chose the Standard Sphere Grid, which all of us here in the America's grew up with. Then you have a second option to chose. Expert, which let's you pick where you want your characters to start out at in the sphere grid, rather than having everyone on their own set path.\nFor example, you could make Tidus the White Mage(healer), Yuna the Tank, Kimari the Black Mage, and so on. So if you ever felt that a character had a more fitting role as something else, or you just want to balance each character a little better, or you just want to say ♥♥♥♥ it and just mess around by giving everyone random rolls, you can in the Expert Sphere Grid Version.\nAnother option has been added, besides the adjustable graphics, you can give yourself all of the consumable items and max gill. That's pretty usefull if you just want to try and speed run this game. It doesn't give you any of the Al Bhed primers or any other Key Items, so you don't need to worry about the game locking up on you at a certain point should you chose to use those options.\n\nPros:\nAdjustable Graphic settings that can go as high as your set up can support\n\nAmazing remaster\n\nBeautiful Sound Track\n\nGreat Nostalgia Trip\n\n\nCons:\n\nLocked at 30 fps\n\nNo Japanese Audio\n\nIlluminati\n\n\n8/10\nwood nostalg again","May 24","true","65.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have been mostly re-playing X. I am guessing that with the efforts they put into X, X-2 will be just as good.  I played both back in the day on PS2.  I never got far into X-2 but I remember loving X.  I was seriously thinking of getting the console remasters but then there was a rumor it would come to steam.  I waited just to be safe and by the light, here it is.  First off, despite being an older game, it looks surprisingly well remastered.  The character models are good all things considered.  Yeah some of the old NPCS in towns look a lil rough but everything else looks pretty good.  I wouldn't have wanted them to change much anyways because it was such a good game naturally.  I recommend it to anyone that loved the original and want to keep it in their collection.  I have so much appreciation for Square for porting some of these classics over to PC so we can play them still.  I know some of the ports have came out rough but X is not one of them.\n\nPS, Square head haunchos, if you are reading this, please consider porting over some of your non-Final Fantasy franchises as well.

For example a part of it where the characters supposed to be awkward is something people who havent even played the game know through internet references.  Every character has an arc, even the secondary antagonist who is the normal "I will destroy the entire world" type and so one of the weaker characters has an actual sensical reason behind his actions.\n\nThe interactions between the characters are fantastic too, though it is difficult to go into without spoilers.  As an example which doesnt spoil too much, one of the main characters has problems which are very important to him, one of the foundations of his personality.  These problems are nothing compared to what one of his friends, who too is a main character, has seen.  The second guy belittles the first guys problems when appropriate while also understanding how they effect him and and treating them with respect in general and also trying to help him work through them.  IE the way a normal couple of people would.  Which doesnt sound like much, but can you think to yourself that kind of interaction in any other game?\n\nEven the graphics stand up well, particularily in terms of aesthetic design.  X looks fantastic even today, the HD remaster for the most part makes it look even better.  The game is a decade and a half old at this point.  A lot of good looking games came out in 2001, not many have aged as well as FFX.\n\nI wish I could go more into how many great things this game has, but I cant without spoilers...  Which is a shame.  The purchase is worth it for X alone, and you get X-2 as well (another reason FF purists dislike X, it being the first one deemed "worthwhile" to get a direct sequel and not VI or VII!!!  Blasphemy!) which makes it even better.\n\n\nThe only negatives I can think of are that the soundtrack was made worse than in the original for the HD remake.  They misstepped a lot with it, but one of the worst things they did was remove some or all of the bass from most of the tracks.  And another negative is that the optional challenge content requires you to basically re-level your characters again (unless you want to exploit some cheap systems), which is kind of a pain.  That being said it isnt a huge issue because the content is optional to begin with and then there are a couple of easy ways to beat it.","May 18","true","0.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was overwhelmed with joy when I found out it was coming to PC and bought it day 1!\n\nFFX Review- This game had no hiccups on my system whatsoever. It was a solid port and brought back a lot of nostalgia of my teenage years. The story is the best thing about this game. Voice acting is kinda corny at times but I enjoyed every moment from beginning to end. It was a well thought out game.\n\nFFX-2 Review- This game felt like it was rushed by Square Enix. The combat system when I booted it up was extremely different then FFX. I never had a chance to play this when I was younger so it came to be a pretty weird. The overall story felt flat, I was hoping for a more vibrant world vs FFX but it felt dull. I enjoyed the game none the less but it didn't have the same emotional impact of FFX.\n\nOverall this was a great purchase for me personally. I will always recommend FFX. If there's a possibility of a FFX-3 then I would recommend FFX-2 just so you can get more of the story to build towards FFX-3 (if it'll ever happen).","May 26","true","52.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But with many hundreds played throughout PS2 and PS3, I'm in a place to confirm that this is still the greatest Final Fantasy game, and  still one of the best RPGs ever made, and still, one of the greatest games of all time.\n\nDat soundtrack... You know the one.\n\nSo lets review this based on my experience on how this port has played. I'm rocking an i5 2500, GTX 970, 8gb ram, and it's running like  a dream, and it's stunning in Full HD too.\n\nThe options are intriguing, and you can set up, sort of a God Mode. But I'm going to play it the old way. There is also the option to use a different soundtrack, but again, I didn't, because I wanted to experience the game as I remember it.\n\nI've seen reviews stating this is constantly crashing and people are having a hard time with it. Not so for me, which leads me to think it's more of a them issue.\n\nIf you want the nostalgia, pick it up. Pick it up anyway, This is a timeless classic, and X-2 wasn't too bad either, a game that ended the story amazingly. just remember if you do, you have the Chocobo race to do again!\n\nAnd currently, it's a steal at £15.99 for both.\n\nA massive yes from me.

I remember really enjoying when I first played it and I was worried my memory of the game would be greater than what the game actually was. But I enjoyed it quite a bit a second time around and it held up pretty well aside from the horrendous cutscenes. It's crazy to think about how Square just churned out hit after hit of amazing classic RPGs from this franchise in the 90s and early 00s and then to think about what garbage the FF series has given us since this game.\n\nA quick sidenote for those who never played a game in this series or are otherwise unaware: The stories and battle mechanics of each game in the Final Fantasy series are completely unrelated. Each game in the series has a completely new cast of characters and settings, and there's nearly always a different battle system with different battle mechanics and rules. The series has some common elements and reoccurring motifs; for instance there's usually magic or summon monsters and for some reason there's almost always a character named Cid that appears somewhere in the game. But you don't have to have played FF9 before FF10 or anything like that.\n\nFF10 (or FFX for you Romans) follows the story of a young man named Tidus who is a star blitzball player from the futuristic city of Zanarkand. Blitzball is some kind of crazy combination of football and soccer, but played underwater. It also serves as FFX's primary minigame. It's kind of broken and clunky, but the football fan in me enjoys it despite its faults. Anyway, in the game's prologue, the Zanarkand blitzball arena is suddenly attacked by a massive whale-looking monster known as "Sin". Sin magically transports Tidus 1000 years into the future to another world called "Spira". While searching for a way to get back home to Zanarkand, Tidus learns about the world of Spira and befriends some of its residents. He learns that Spira has always been under constant torment by the same Sin monster he encountered in Zanarkand. Tidus soon befriends a young girl, Yuna, who is training to become a summoner in hopes to obtain a summon monster powerful enough to destroy Sin. FFX's main storyline deals with Tidus, Yuna and her guardian's journey across Spira and their quest to defeat Sin.\n\nI found the story and pacing for FFX to be both very good. Now the thing that's an absolute trainwreck and nearly ruins the game are the voice acting and cutscenes. Final Fantasy X was the first game in the series to be voice acted, and it definitely shows. Each cutscene is more awkward and cringe-worthy than the last. You may have seen the infamous laughing scene on YouTube before. Yeah, that's pretty much how all of the cutscenes in this game are. Now the actual story that is behind these cutscenes is pretty good. But oh man, those cutscenes. It might actually be better to watch them on mute. You have to try to focus on what the game is trying to show you, not how the game is showing it. If you can't do that, you'll probably find this game's story pretty laughable. No pun intended.\n\nFinal Fantasy X's battle system is pretty tight and well balanced. Information like damage, status effects, and weaknesses are clearly communicated to the player during battle instead of having to guess which enemies are weak vs. which elements or try to figure out whether the status effect spell you just cast was successful based on what color a sprite is. If you equip your party with the proper "sensor weapons", you will even see strategies on how to defeat specific enemies, their HP, and what their weaknesses are. It's the kind of useful information the FF series always used to hide in the background instead of telling you straight up for some reason. There's a good variety of enemies that all have strengths and weaknesses to different members of your party. For instance flying-type monsters need to be taken down by a ranged fighter, while Tidus' sword is effective on smaller more nimble monsters. Still others may be weak to magic spells and require a Mage to defeat. It's a fun, strategic turn-based battle system that will have you rotating your party members in and out in order to try to exploit enemies' weaknesses.\n\nFFX is notable for not having a world map to explore, which is normally a series staple for Final Fantasy. I was afraid this would be too much like FFXIII, a game which I hated for having linear corridor after linear corridor strung together as level design. But you never really get that feeling in FFX. The level design does a good job with divergent paths and interesting things to do and people to talk to in all of the areas to make you forget there's no world map linking everything together. The level design and pacing is pretty good in this game... except for the puzzle solving sections in stupid cloister of trails areas. People who have played this game before know what I'm talking about. Tedious, time wasting puzzles with random arbitrary logic that you have to solve by trial and error. Terrible game design. Whoever put these in the game needs to be smacked upside the head.\n\nFinal Fantasy X also is notable for being the first game in the series that was not exclusively composed by the legendary Nobuo Uematsu. It was a collaboration between him and some other dudes. It's still a excellent soundtrack, but it sounds different than a lot of the other games in the series, and some of it sounds very un-Final Fantasy to me. Most of the soundtrack has a very electronic and synthesized sound. Still good, just different. Standout tracks include The Main Battle Theme (Nobuo Uematsu),  Rikku's Theme (Nobuo Uematsu), Battle With Seymour (Nobuo Uematsu), Besaid Island (Masashi Hamauzu), and Illusion (Junya Nakano). It's easy to hear each composer's different style and which tracks they contributed to the soundtrack.\n\nThe soundtrack to the HD version was remixed, which I was a little disappointed in. Even though it had been 10 years since I played this game, I have the soundtrack on my phone and listen to it all the time, so some of the remixes were a little jarring to me. The HD remix soundtrack grew on me eventually, some tracks are more subtle and little less "in your face" than the originals and probably more appropriate in certain areas. But at least include the option for me to switch back to the old ones if I want!\n\nSummary:\nOverall FFX is a pretty solid game. Solid battle system, excellent soundtrack and good story. Terrible voice acting. I would actually recommend it as a good entry point for newcomers to the series if it weren't for those cutscenes. As it stands though, I'd probably tell Final Fantasy newbies to start with the masterpiece that is FFVII. It's may not be as polished, refined or pretty looking as FFX, but at least it doesn't have the infamous laughing scene in it.\n\nFor more game reviews, check out http://whatisjamesplaying.blogspot.com/","June 4","true","54.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Assuming you liked it on the PS2, you'll be able to fall in love all over again with the PC version.\n\nLet me start with the cons, as they are few but still annoying.\n\n- Still no ability to skip cut scenes.\n- The minigames are still terrible.\n- Inputting Auron's overdrive prompts on a non-PS2 controller has been clumbsy.\n- It's the same game, so if you hated it back in the day, you'll still hate it now.\n- Seriously, why can't we skip cutscenes?\n\nReally, that's it.  Now for the overwhelming pros.\n\n- Runs smoothly, without issue.  Immediately recognized my controller, had no crashes or freezes or even any bugs.\n- Runs QUICKLY.  The PS3 Remastered version had load times, not long ones, but still noticeable, especially when entering several different rooms at once; you'd see the spinning Jecht symbol and have to wait five seconds.  This version has none of that.  Much faster.\n- Remastered textures.  The games looks better than ever (though little if any different from the PS3/4 remastered versions).\n- Additional content (compared to US PS2 version).  You can now fight the Dark Aeons and Penace, as well as use minor new abilities and equipment, not to mention the Expert Sphere Grid.\n- PC Perks.  At the press of a button, you can have no random encounters or one every two steps; you can speed the gameplay up x2 or x4; you can even enter a 'cheat mode' where you have max stats.  This speeds things up so much.  Farming for the monster area?  Turn on turbo and more encounters and you'll be done in less than half the time.  Fantastic.\n- The Creature Creator in FFX2 deserves a special shoutout.  Yes, FFX2 is an abomination, yada yada, I know ... but Creator Creature is fun!  You can access it after the introduction and just go to town.  It almost makes the rest of the game less disasterific.\n- Can choose between original or the enhanced soundtrack, and the original or expert sphere grids.\n- Still the same game, so if you loved it back in the day, you'll feel the same today.\n\nThis is the forth time I've bought a version of FFX, and this is the best version, hands-down.

I must have put 1000 hours into this game. The gameplay is addicting, the story is enjoyable,  and auron may be the best character in final fantasy history. But where this game really shined was the graphics. The cinematic cutscenes were heartbreaking and beautiful and stood the test of time.  As a kid this game made me realize video games had become so much more with this incredible PS2 launch game.  This is easily my favorite game of all time.  P.S. the soundtrack may be the most diverse yet impressive soundtrack i have ever heard.  Thank you Nobuo for the wonderful soundtrack.","May 13","true","46.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I've had a dream of playing my favorite game on the PC. I've downloaded many emulators and the PAL release in order to play FFX to it's fullest and put a lot of time into playing the content that was cut from the NTSC release. One of my benchmarks for my PC builds was always if it could run FFX on PCSX2 at full speed and 1080 scaling. How surprised I was when FFX HD was announced initially for consoles & the Vita and I immediately pre-ordered it, something I haven't done since FFX-2 came out. I played the game for over 150 hours, and 100% beat the game and got every trophy on the vita release, and here we are 2 years later and I get to dodge 200 lightning strikes again on the PC and I won't hesitate to do so.\n\nFinal Fantasy X is where Square Enix peaked with the franchise IMO, and it hasn't had a title that captures the emotion of the series, formula, and gameplay all in one title since. If you have never played an Final Fantasy title I highly recommend you start with this one and work your way backwards if you enjoy the game.\n\nIt is an overall good port, depsite being locked at 30 fps and with some easy to insert mods you can play the game in japanese voices if the Tidus laugh scene annoys you that much.","May 18","true","14.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It has a beautifully tragic story, and the sphere grid is a lovely way to level. It was a game of firsts, and set the bar for how we would view big-budget RPGs. Released before DLC was a thing, it made you practice the art of the sidequest. If you are an FF or Square fan, this game is a must have.\n\nFFX-2: Was not a fan of the combat style, nor of some of the things square chose to do with the story. It does bring some nice closure to the fates of the survivors from Yuna's Pilgrimage, and is coupled with some beautiful songs.  For the completionists, this game may fall short compared to the first, but is worth the playthrough, if only for the story, songs and seeing Yuna and Rikku in less restrictive clothing. Also, some of the mini-games are worth a look, if you have some patience and a good memory.\n\nNote: My time played clock isn't accurate due to not playing steam games while online.","May 27","true","0.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Option to toggle original or arranged music scores, sphere grid in standard or expert modes. Using a wired X360 controller in my PC, game instantly recognized it and all the buttons were mapped correctly. Absolutely no configuration needed to get going. Turned the graphics options up to max, enjoying this a lot so far. Game looks crisp and clear, not sure what all the 30fps fuss is about, haven't noticed any downside to the fps lock. Cloud saves, "cheats" if you are re-playing the game and just want to enjoy the story, steam achievements... Just wish I had more free time to play!

The remaster has added a completely re-done soundtrack to the game, and higher resolution textures and visuals. The original CGI cutscenes introduced in the PS2 version are completely unscathed, however.\nThe PC version of Final Fantasy X has some added features such as Turbo Speed, Auto HP regen/Overdrive Mode, the ability to toggle on/off encounters, and auto AI battle mode. I wouldn't recommend these options for someone playing through the first time through the game as it might ruin the experience. Final Fantasy X-2 has a different set of cheat options.\n\nMy only complaint is that there is no option to skip cutscenes. This is my fifth(?) time playing through Final Fantasy X and I have to watch the cutscenes over and over again.  I understand they want you playing this game for the experience. I get it. But still not having this option in the year 2016 is beyond my level of understanding. Especially considering most of the people who are going to buy this game have probably played it before. You can still choose to skip cutscenes in FFX-2, but why would you want to miss out on that 100%?\n\nOverall this is a good game, but not a great one. Keep Netflix or Crunchyroll on hand while playing this game to make sure you don't bore yourself to tears.","May 18","true","29.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

So basically i played the original and then went on to play this remaster many years later.\n\nSo lets start with whats called the TURD sandwich - We put out all the games GOOD and BAD points all in 1 go and then explain the details\n\nBAD -\n1) Remastered faces - Congrates square enix - aside from Lulu and expressionless kimahri all the characters new faces suck balls! Tidus face now looks cartoon like with chubby cheeks and slope eyes, Auron looks as if he is wearing lipstick in some parts, Wakka looks as if he has had a mild stroke.....i know its a remaster but WHY did square-enix have to mess the faces up and remove model nodes so less expressions would show. Everything else they did was great so why ruin the  face nodes and make it so less emotion comes through?\n\nGOOD -\n2) This is the LAST great game from SquareSOFT - not that r-tarded company square-Enix who havent produced a good game in over 10 years but squareSOFT! - ie the masters who gave us Chrono Cross/Trigger , tobal 1+2 , Xenogears, Parasite Eve , Front misson 3 and various others. FFx-2 was by Square-Enix and NOT squareSOFT. Pretty much all the original guys left square at the end of FFx and then began the merging of square-enix and a load of new people came in which is why X-2 is so damn crap and boring.........like most square enix games to date\n\nGOOD -\n3) This is the international release - IE you get more stuff added to it and extra battle and bosses and items and various other bits and pieces. I never got to play this version as i had an original 1980's looking Brick PS2 with the crap DVD reader which broke after about 1 year. So for me this is the first time i get to play the international version\n\nBAD -\n4) The story is really stupid - like im sure some japanese guy took a load of crystal meth, was given some paper and a pen and then just wrote this story down in about 2 hours. The main idea for the story is perfect..........until you actually read the story and are like errr....\n\nThis is how i USED to think the story went when i was younger - sin appears and destroys zanarkand, Auron takes tidus to sin who is actually jecht, jecht teleports tidus to the future but in order for this to happen tidus has become a ghost the same as auron. They meet Yuna and go on the adventure and in the end defeat sin, stop Yevon who turn out to be bad guys, Tidus finds out he isnt alive anymore and passes on once sin is defeated.\n\nNow THIS is how F-ing confusing it ACTUALLY is\nZanarkand ISNT real.........its DREAM zanarkand, tidus jecht and all the millons of people who live there are not real, Auron who died at the hands of Yunaleska died and then went to dream zanarkand to meet tidus, sin just APPEARS and destroys dream zanarkand without any explanation as to sins origins, Yunaleska whos meant to be all powerful just gets her A-hole handed to her in 1 fight, jecht isnt real but comes to spira.........and never mentions how his city worked? no trade with other countries or anything like that? Then Yevon turn out to be bad guys just ....because....and then everyone in Yevon turns out to be evil....because....and then the Al Bhed who have been seen as the bad guys for hundreads of years are suddenly not seen in this way half way through the game, Yuna through the entire game NOW just comes accross as if shes desperate for sausage - she flirts with tidus right away and makes it clear she want some. She hardly knows a thing about him yet flirts like mad with him in the first hour of the game. REAL zanarkand was destroyed 1000years ago, dream zanarkand wasnt because it was a dream.........so wtf is the start of the game about?\n\nThe rest of the story is more complicated but i wont even start with how stupid this story is when you combine it with x-2's which really makes absolute SOD-ALL sense considering sin was defeated and Yevon shouldnt be around anymore\n\n5) BAD -\nFORCED buy of FFx-2\nIm saying forced because its clear square-enix just did this to make more sales and sell the games as a bundle rather than seperate and see X did amazingly well while x-2 sells badly. The price isnt bad........if your buying the game off ebay, steams price is a tad too high for a 10+ year old game\n\n6) GOOD -\nOriginal music - we have the proper music in this and a remix (which no one will use) so thankfully you wont have to mod the original music BACK into the game like what people had to do with FF8\n\n7) GOOD -\nThe gameplay is a good now as it was then, its a great battle system ..............However you then play x-2 and see how crap its become........then slowly realise this was the start of all the other crap games square-enix would release like FF13 which was a 80hour tutorial. I say Play X and pretend X-2 doesnt happen\n\n8) BAD -\nx-2 in a nutshell 'I want to find tidus again - then spends 90% of game not looking for tidus' the story is bad, the battle system is bad, the world now seems dull with everyone split up and no sin, your rival is a pink woman with x2 idiot goons, bad comedy, CLONE tidus who isnt tidus......or is he? considering GHOST zanarkand wasnt real then do the ghosts just live the same lives over and over? coz clone tidus LOOKS like normal Tidus. The we have the idiot monster robot under yevons basement.................................sigh\n\n9) BAD -\nEmo Lesbain Femenist Paine\nShe is perhaps the WORST character added into a game in the entire history of the FF franchise. Not only was she clearly added in last minute (Which is plain as day considering almost zero characters have conversations with her aside from 1 guy with a walking stick........for 1 part.....and thats it....and then afew conversations with Yuna and Rikki were paines responce is either -yes,no, or a sentance which could have been slotted in anywere) but her character in general is just crap. She was made clearly for 1 target audience but just comes across as a fortgettable character who doesnt have 1 good thing about her. Some people have tried to defend her by claiming she is a female Squall from FF8..............im not sure what idiot pills these people are on but Squall wasnt an emo lesbian femenist with zero character growth and who sucked. Its like claiming having a tumor in your balls just means your balls look bigger to impress the ladies, no matter what you say its STILL a seriously bad thing.\n\nX-2 im not sure if it was TRYING to be funny by just having 3 moody women going on a dull adventure were they face off against pink villian and fat camp man and thin camp man while looking for clone tidus.......but this game ISNT funny like CAMP funny like what the HyperDimensional Neptunia games are which ARE actually enjoyable..........this game.......this is just a choir to play and you get sick of Emo Paine, mental break down Yuna and MEGA cheer Rikki after about 2 hours.\n\nIt IS a brilliant game over all but the story does seem rather wacked out at times and X-2 really does show how bad square-enix becomes and the crap they end up giving us. I LOVED ffx when i first played it and would recommend X to any new people today and original gamers.\n\nReview in short\n[Good]\ncharacters\nstory\nworld\nbattle system\n\n[Bad]\nblitzball\nx-2 being mini-games everywere\nthe ultime weapons are a nightmae to get\n200 lightening dodges\nYou look just like my brother chappu - you see chappu, he looks F-all like you........wakka needs glasses","June 4","true","29.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","3"

I loved the game even though I could not beat it. I was at the part right before Yunalesca. It took me 11 years to beat the game for the first time. Did it thanks to guides telling me how to beat certain bosses. (Oh and Yojimbo's Zanmato) For 11 years this was my favorite game even though I didn't know how it ended. When I finally beat it, I wasn't disappointed. Well, except that Yu Yevon was literally the worst boss I had ever faced in a game. This port to PC is amazing. I have heard that Square Enix ports to PC are normally really bad. (I wouldn't know.)\n\nPros:\n-My favorite game of all time.\n-Kicking the Luca Goers asses on PC\n-Auto saves\n-All the game boosters. (I have only used the speed up one)\n-It is beautiful.\n-THE SOUNDTRACK IS AMAZING. 100/10\n\nCons:\n-The Luca goers... in HD\n-The ever-so awful laughing scene. At least I know I can mute it now.\n-Seymor... Oh I hate his guts soooooo much.\n-The final boss.\n-They made a sequel.\n\nFinal rating: 10/10\nThis is my favorite game of all time and no matter how many cons it has, I still think that the pros out way them by so much. This is an easy 30 dollars that I would spend again. (Or have my friend buy.)

I won't say best, since I encountered some problem with the game. Sometimes the game force closed, especially after I use the turbo mode or when I am going to choose destination on the airship. I don't know if it's only me or anyone else have the same experience. I'm grateful that there is autosave feature, tho.\n\nCons:\n- Can't skip event (like, when you are going to fight Seymour Flux and you defeated. I think you will watch the same event over and over before re-fighting him.) FMV at Macalania Woods can be skipped though.\n\n- Sometimes the game force closed (as I mentioned above, duh)\n\n- The damn Chocobo Catcher is here. Good luck obtaining Tidus's Sun Sigil. (It's not really con though. Just the game mechanic, which is annoying IMO)\n\n- English dub for english sub, Japanese dub for japanese sub. Thanks to modders, now we got Japanese dub for english sub.\n\nPros:\n- X-2 (more games on one purchase, good)\n- Anima\n- Smoother character designs\n- Best gameplay\n- Best character status development\n- Anima\n- Lulu\n- Soundtrack of choice (original or arranged, both are source of eargasm)\n- Anima\n- Anima\n- Once again, Anima\n\nSome of my friends wondered why did I bought this old game.

Did fiddle around with the graphics settings, and to my surprise I haven't had a single frame drop. This game looks GORGEOUS. (For its age, of course)\n- Game is running SMOOOOOOOTH. Any modern PC can run this game with no problems at all. Mine is very outdated.\n- Original soundtrack! A big plus. The rearranged versions are hit or miss. I'll stick to the original.\n- Japanese voices are there, but you might have to do some modding to get English subtitles with it.\n- Xbox 360 controller works perfectly with no prior configuration needed. Buttons are remappable (if you like the US confirm/cancel schema, like me). Xbox button faces available ingame. From what I heard, Steam Controller won't work if you have another controller plugged in. Disconnect it and you should be good to go.\n- Apparently this game uses XInput. No word on DInput. See above.\n- 30 FPS lock. Sorry, 60 FPS enthusiasts. This doesn't bother me but some will hate it with a passion.\n- Cutscenes cannot be skipped. This is a disappointment (exceptions are the prerendered CGIs)\n- Haven't tested the boosters and I will not do so. I prefer the vanilla experience.\n\n\nPlayed it until I reached Besaid, and I get the impression that this is indeed a great port and I am extremely satisfied. Final Fantasy X was the first RPG I ever finished and I played it to oblivion back in the day. This game brings back a lot of good memories of my teenage years.\n\nIt seems Square Enix did an excellent job on this one. Thank you very much for getting this port done right. My only complaint is the inability to skip cutscenes.

The HD actually works, and it doesn't feel jarring and out of place (*cough*FFIX*cough*).\n\nHaving said that, its worth pointing out that the game defaults to Japanese text - and the settings menu is slightly hidden at the bottom of the launcher.

No technical issues thus far and everything looks spectacular. I'm not going to complain about a locked framerate, becuase the original was 30, and to be frank, this game does not need 60 FPS. The majority of the time will be spent in battles, which are turn-based, and would not benefit from a higher framerate. I've yet to use any boosters, but I'm sure I'll be taking advantage of the speed booster at some point. I was also a fan of X-2, which I will be playing through again. I think the reason X-2 wasn't recieved well in the west was because straight guys are terrified to play any game where all of the main characters are women. Stars forbid their friends call them gay! My wallet is now officially owned by Square Enix. CAN'T WAIT FOR XV! P.S. Lulu's ♥♥♥♥ are no longer red and square!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/obsidian_age/recommended/359870/","obsidian_age","Obsidian Age","http://steamcommunity.com/id/obsidian_age/","1718 products in account","Final Fantasy X and X-2 are some of the most iconic games there are in existence, let alone the Final Fantasy series. This review will talk more about the differences between the Steam release and the original PS2 games, but in short, Final Fantasy X is a completely standalone game from the other games in the Final Fantasy series, and X-2 leads on from where X left off. Final Fantasy X sees you play as Tidus, a Blitzball payer from Zanarkand who gets flung into the world of Spira where he must assist Yuna on her pilgrimage to defeat Sin. X-2 switches control to Yuna, who has formed a group of Sphere Hunters with old friend Rikku and new friend Paine.\n\nPort Quirks:\nAll in all, this is a pretty decent port. There's only 'partial' controller support, but the only important things that can't be controlled using a controller are the new boosters. Both keyboard and controller controls are bindable, which is very nice. There's multiple language selections, with both English and Japanese audio. The Japanese is a little buggy, though modders are already hard at work fixing that. For some reason, when I fired the game up for the first time, the game defaulted to Japanese text. This includes menu navigation, which can make it a little confusing to change back to English. Hopefully this is just a glitch, and not intended behaviour. Additionally, my game defaulted to a 1280x760 windowed resolution with 'low' graphic settings. This can easily be changed, but nonetheless is a slight gripe that others may encounter. Another nice feature of the port is achievements. The PS3 and PS4 versions had trophies, but the Steam version adds achievements for the truly hardcore players to try and complete. Can you get them all?\n\nHD Remaster:\nThis Steam version is the equivalent of the PS3 & PS4's HD remaster, with a few differences. The HD remaster attempts to modernise the original PS2 game by improving the musical score and the graphics. Whether or not these are an improvement over the original music and graphics in the PS2 version is open to debate. Some of the new music sounds really great, but it naturally won't have the nostalgia of the original music -- there really is quite a difference. However, in this version all of the audio channels are on sliders. Want to increase the SFX while decreasing the background music? Now you can! The graphics are undoubtedly a vast improvement over the background objects from the original, with some smoother edges to the characters. Unfortunately, the character's eyes have been completely re-done, and in the process appear to have lost all emotion. Despite the facial 'improvements', they still haven't fixed the problem with the lip-syncing from the original Japanese audio to the English audio. The Steam version builds on the HD Remaster by allowing you to further customise the graphics, with adjustments to things such as screen resolution, brightness, shadow quality and anti-aliasing.\n\nInternational Version:\nThere were a number of exclusives to the original PS2 game based on geographic region. The Steam version is based on the International Version, meaning you have access to them all! In Final Fantasy X, there's access to the new Expert Sphere Grid, for advanced players already familiar with the original game. There's also 10 new powerful optional bosses, plus one new powerful super-boss to track down and defeat. Included in the game selection menu is a video that fills in a bit of the story between the two games, along with some developer interviews as well. Finally, there are a few new skills for you to try out on the Sphere Grid. Final Fantasy X-2 boasts new Dresspheres, along with a new 'Creature Creator' and Field Arena tournaments. Now you can train monsters to fight alongside you! While it does make the game quite a bit easier, it is a nice new feature to play around with. There's also a brand new mission in Final Fantasy X-2 to try out, available from the game selection menu.\n\nSteam Exclusive Features:\nIn addition to the features from the International Version, the Steam version adds a number of features that none of the previous versions have. These come in the form of 'boosters', that previous Steam Final Fantasy players may be familiar with. Essentially, they're little add-ons that make the game easier for you. In Final Fantasy X, you have a turbo mode that will increase the game by 2x or 4x speed, an option to always perform overdrives, an option to eliminate or change the rate of encounters, an option to have the characters battle automatically for you, and an option to disable the HUD. While the turbo feature can really come in handy on your 20th playthrough of the game, it sadly doesn't fast-forward through cut-scenes or FMVs, only actual gameplay. Some FMVs can be skipped, which is nice. The other features do feel a little like cheating, but some may find benefit in their use. If you really want to cheat, there's the option to max out your items, max out your Gil, and teach your characters all abilities.\n\nSummary:\nThese two games are absolutely amazing, and this port does a decent job at bringing these classics to Steam. The price is cheap, and the games are well worth the money. For the games themselves, I'd give Final Fantasy X a 10/10, and Final Fantasy X-2 an 8/10. With regards to the Steam port, I'd give it a 7/10. If you haven't played either of the games before, I say that you simply must try them out. If you have played them before, you already know how amazing they are, so what are you waiting for? Go ahead and pick up this release right now! :)","May 13","true","267.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It looks great and plays smooth.  I'm running a i5-4760k and SLI GTX 970 FTWs on Windows 10.  I only overclock my CPU and RAM.  I've heard some complaints about multiple GPU performance but have not experienced any issues myself.  I'm running the most recent GeForce drivers.  I would recommend turning down your GPU to stock and make sure you have the latest drivers if you have any issues.  Some games don't do well overclocked because the GPU has to wait for other processes to be complete before turning the next frame.  That means, if you crank up your GPU...it just ends up waiting longer which can cause issues.  Some chipsets don't work well together either.  It's worth knowing you have a chipset specifically for your GPU.\n\nI'm a fan of orchestrated music and this port allows you to use the arranged score in play of the original soundtrack.  They knocked it out of the park with this function.  The arranged score is beautiful and fits in perfect.\n\nThe gameplay is stable (on a stable system) and I've had no tearing, freezing, skipping, nor found any bugs to complain about up to Luca (haven't been xping much if at all).  I'll update once I'm through the story.\n\nWhile the graphics settings only offer low, medium, and high...you can tweak settings through the Nvidia control panel if you are running on a lower resolution but want to smooth textures through antialiasing.  Good detail in shadows and lighting without messing with anything.  Increased environment detail.  Huge improvements on the original and leagues above the console HD versions if you have a powerful enough PC.\n\nYou can play on both the original and expert sphere grids.  Expert can be fun just to mix things up a bit if you've ran through the game at least once already.\n\nI don't use the game boosters but you can speed up gameplay, turn off random encounters (might use that one later), get unlimited money, unlock all skills, and always full overdrive meter.\n\nGreat port for a great game.  Hope this helps.\n\n\n\n","May 19","true","3.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Did fiddle around with the graphics settings, and to my surprise I haven't had a single frame drop. This game looks GORGEOUS. (For its age, of course)\n- Game is running SMOOOOOOOTH. Any modern PC can run this game with no problems at all. Mine is very outdated.\n- Original soundtrack! A big plus. The rearranged versions are hit or miss. I'll stick to the original.\n- Japanese voices are there, but you might have to do some modding to get English subtitles with it.\n- Xbox 360 controller works perfectly with no prior configuration needed. Buttons are remappable (if you like the US confirm/cancel schema, like me). Xbox button faces available ingame. From what I heard, Steam Controller won't work if you have another controller plugged in. Disconnect it and you should be good to go.\n- Apparently this game uses XInput. No word on DInput. See above.\n- 30 FPS lock. Sorry, 60 FPS enthusiasts. This doesn't bother me but some will hate it with a passion.\n- Cutscenes cannot be skipped. This is a disappointment (exceptions are the prerendered CGIs)\n- Haven't tested the boosters and I will not do so. I prefer the vanilla experience.\n\n\nPlayed it until I reached Besaid, and I get the impression that this is indeed a great port and I am extremely satisfied. Final Fantasy X was the first RPG I ever finished and I played it to oblivion back in the day. This game brings back a lot of good memories of my teenage years.\n\nIt seems Square Enix did an excellent job on this one. Thank you very much for getting this port done right. My only complaint is the inability to skip cutscenes.

The good news is the wait has been worth it. It is a port of the HD remaster for PS3/PS4. Traditionally Square Enix Final Fantasy ports have been hit or miss for one reason or another. Some titles are ports of their mobile counterparts which doesn't translate well to PC.\n\nI am glad to say that from the time I have spent with the game thus far the game has run at a steady frame rate on my i5 with a GTX 750 ti 2gb Vram OC'ed and 8 gb of total ram. I have not yet experienced a crash of any sort. Perhaps the game was easier to port from PS4 given the similar architecture. I am unsure if this is a port of the PS3 or PS4 version. What I will say is that the game looks great and comes with a variety of resolution options as well as windowed, full screen and borderless window.\n\nIn addition to those options the PC port also supports a variety of other video options including antialiasing, color correction, shadows, anisoptropic filtering, tex quality, post filter aa, unsharp mask, and Ambient occlusion.\n\nThese options are certainly welcome and a good step up from other ports from Square. Though it is disappointing the game still appears to be capped at 30fps. Its not a deal breaker as this isn't a fast paced shooter or anything where frame rate really matters.\n\nThe game also features a number of 'cheats' ranging from encounter rates to max items, gil and skill unlocks. These are nice options for people that may just want to experience the story. As you might expect acheivements are also available.\n\nWith the technical stuff out of the way, this is the same game you remember and love from the PS2 with a new coat of paint. If you never played the original or the remake. You play as Tidus a star Blitzball player and embark on an adventure to defeat Sin. On the way you will meet likeable characters and upgrade them using a sphere grid to unlock new abilities. There are plenty of side activities to partake in including Blitzball, finding all the aeons, acquiring Legendary weapons and more. X-2 is also included which is a matter of take it or leave it for some folks.\n\nAll in all FFX/X-2 HD for PC is a solid port and is something Square should carry forward from here on out and seek to raise the bar even higher.\n\n*UPDATE*\n\nI forgot to mention that the game features international content as well as rearranged music. Purists can still opt for the original soundtrack though. One of the only criticisms I really have is the same I had with the remaster on PS3/PS4. The updated main character models are quite nice. But the other NPC's don't really match the same attention to detail paid to the main characters. I realize though that overhauling the characters for all of the NPCs would have taken considerable time. But its a disappointment still.","May 25","true","5.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Essesprofile/recommended/359870/","Essesprofile","TEEDUS - PAULSTRETCH EDITION","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Essesprofile/","1177 products in account","I'll try to make this short and avoid using any childish puns.\n\nFINAL FANTASY X\n\nFinal Fantasy X is a jRPG which tells the story of Tidus, a boy who enjoys Blitzball (basically Underwater Hand-ball) and has severe family issues. He's playing a blitzball game until he gets thrown several thousand years into the future by a giant whale thing. It's up to the player to help him figure out what's going on and how to go back home. The story isn't particularly original, but it can keep the player's interest until the end, and most characters are pretty cool\n\nCombat is turn-based and lets you use all of your characters in battle, with only 3 appearing on screen at the same time that can be switched during each of your turns, leading to many tactical possibilities\n\nThe character growth system is very unique and involves a huge grid where your characters earn abilities and stat boosts by moving in it through the use of AP which can be acquired by killing enemies. Each character also has unique abilities called Overdrives, which can be obtained in many different ways, incentivating the player to explore the game in order to find new Overdrives and become stronger.\n\nYou can also take on several sidequests and minigames which can be fun timesinks (like Blitzball) or dreadful minigames designed by Satan himself (the lightning dodging and the butterfly catching)\n\nFFX's graphics are nice, clean and smooth. The cutscenes still look enjoyable today (and some of them can be skipped now!) and watching Aeons wreck stuff is always amazing to look at.\n\nFINAL FANTASY X MINUS 2\n\nFinal Fantasy X-2 is the ignorant sequel to FFX which tells the tale of Yuna, who has somehow lost all dignity after the end of FFX, and her two friends, Rikku and Shadow the Hedgehog---I mean Paine.\n\nTogether they do all sorts of weird jobs, dressed like K-Pop idols and striking poses at every possible occasion, The main quest-line barely gets mentioned during the entire game but it involves Yuna finding a sphere that looks like "Him", which leads her to join a "Sphere-Hunters" gang in order to gather clues that might help her finding "Him" so that they can 'laugh it up' together again ...that's right, he's called "Him" for the entirety of FFX-2.\n\nAs cringy and stupid the story may be, the game itself is actually pretty fun. It is more open-ended than FFX, as you get access to the airship immediately after starting the game and you can go wherever you want. There's tons of side-quests and a lot more mini-games to do this time around, and Blitzball also makes a return (though it is dumbed down from FFX's blitzball)\n\nThe combat is revamped into an 'active turns' based system, with emphasis on timing and cooldown management. Said combat is spiced up even further by the 'Dress-Sphere' system, which is like the Job System from some of the older games in the series, except you can also switch jobs on the fly during battle.\n\nThe HD Remaster has all extra content from the previously Japan-only 'International' release, like the Colosseum which lets you fight old and new faces in arena fights of increasing difficulty, or Creature Capturing which lets you capture every monster in the game and make them fight by your side.\n\nWhen you're done playing FFX-2, you can still find a good challenge in 'The Last Mission', which completes the game's story and takes place in a randomly generated, 80-floor dungeon that you must beat with limited items and party setups.\n\nGraphics took a step up from FFX, with tons of new flashy effects and updated characted models which look gorgeous in HD.\n\nTHE HD REMASTER\n\nThe HD remaster is really good, and it runs smoothly even on toasters.\n\nIt also comes with a lot of new goodies, including an extra novel which is supposedly the Sequel to FFX-2.\n\nIf you haven't bought the FFX/X-2 HD before, then the PC version is easily the best version to get, as it comes already patched from all the issues which plagued the console releases, and the ability to choose text language and new/old soundtrack (which is lacking from the console versions).\n\nThe PC version even comes with a few optional cheats if you want to use them for whatever reason, and it even has a button to skip encounters and another button to make the entire game run 2 times or even 4 times faster than normal, which makes much of the walking/battles a lot less TEDIOUS.\n\n...\n\n...damn it.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pi96ucB7ZdI","May 13","true","5.1"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

No technical issues thus far and everything looks spectacular. I'm not going to complain about a locked framerate, becuase the original was 30, and to be frank, this game does not need 60 FPS. The majority of the time will be spent in battles, which are turn-based, and would not benefit from a higher framerate. I've yet to use any boosters, but I'm sure I'll be taking advantage of the speed booster at some point. I was also a fan of X-2, which I will be playing through again. I think the reason X-2 wasn't recieved well in the west was because straight guys are terrified to play any game where all of the main characters are women. Stars forbid their friends call them gay! My wallet is now officially owned by Square Enix. CAN'T WAIT FOR XV! P.S. Lulu's ♥♥♥♥ are no longer red and square! Let's all rejoice!\n\nUpdate: Spped booster is invaluable during cloister of trials. Lol.\n\nUpdate: I'm already to the Thunder Plains and have had no crashing or slowdown whatsoever.

I bought them separately on the PS2 back the good old days, and I own copies of the HD Remasters on Vita and PS3. In retrospect, if I had known the Steam version was imminent, I would have just skipped the Vita/PS3 versions. This Steam release is indisputably the definitive version of both games, offering all of the additional content provided in the earlier remasters as well as a host of new options exclusive to this version. This is the most complete version of either game that we are ever likely to see. I've encountered a couple of cons so far, listed below, but they are minor blemishes on an otherwise fantastic release. Highly recommended.\n\nPRO:\n-More graphical options than any Final Fantasy PC port thus far. Square Enix may be slowly getting the hang of this "porting to PC" thing.\n-Beautifully remastered graphics. Many of the environments are just stunning here (considering it's a 15 year old game), and I'm noticing details that I didn't even catch on the earlier remasters.\n-The option to choose between the original soundtrack from the PS2 version, or the new arrangements that were produced for the remaster\n-Alternate language audio tracks\n-A brand new menu of optional built-in "boosts" allowing the player to increase the speed of the game, max out gil, max out items, max out characters, and auto-battle. This stuff could be handy for those of us who have already bought the game three times previously and played it into the ground.\n\nCON:\n-Locked at 30 fps. There are apparently already modders working on this, but for the time being, we'll have to do without a 60 fps game. It's still totally enjoyable.\n-Bad keyboard/mouse support. It is HIGHLY recommended that these games be played with a controller. It can be done with a keyboard, but the default keybindings are truly bizarre and game doesn't really utilize the mouse at all. Bad KB+M remains one of the most common issues with JRPG PC ports.\n\n","May 16","true","5.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It looks great and plays smooth.  I'm running a i5-4760k and SLI GTX 970 FTWs on Windows 10.  I only overclock my CPU and RAM.  I've heard some complaints about multiple GPU performance but have not experienced any issues myself.  I'm running the most recent GeForce drivers.  I would recommend turning down your GPU to stock and make sure you have the latest drivers if you have any issues.  Some games don't do well overclocked because the GPU has to wait for other processes to be complete before turning the next frame.  That means, if you crank up your GPU...it just ends up waiting longer which can cause issues.  Some chipsets don't work well together either.  It's worth knowing you have a chipset specifically for your GPU.\n\nI'm a fan of orchestrated music and this port allows you to use the arranged score in play of the original soundtrack.  They knocked it out of the park with this function.  The arranged score is beautiful and fits in perfect.\n\nThe gameplay is stable (on a stable system) and I've had no tearing, freezing, skipping, nor found any bugs to complain about up to Luca (haven't been xping much if at all).  I'll update once I'm through the story.\n\nWhile the graphics settings only offer low, medium, and high...you can tweak settings through the Nvidia control panel if you are running on a lower resolution but want to smooth textures through antialiasing.  Good detail in shadows and lighting without messing with anything.  Increased environment detail.  Huge improvements on the original and leagues above the console HD versions if you have a powerful enough PC.\n\nYou can play on both the original and expert sphere grids.  Expert can be fun just to mix things up a bit if you've ran through the game at least once already.\n\nI don't use the game boosters but you can speed up gameplay, turn off random encounters (might use that one later), get unlimited money, unlock all skills, and always full overdrive meter.\n\nGreat port for a great game.  Hope this helps.\n\n\n\n","May 19","true","3.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Not really but you never know what people will consider to be spoilers).  I may be blinded by the nostalgia goggles a little bit, especially for X-2, but still a sincere review.\n\nFinal Fantasy X\nOh lord, where do I begin.  First played this game when I was 10 years old.  I'm turning 20 in two days and I'm still in love with this game.  In my original PS2 file, I have well over 300 hours in it, and since then with different save files and with the PS3 version and now the Steam version, I probably have nearly 1000 hours total (in FFX alone, not counting X-2).  Its captivating story is a good way to experience every emotion a good story will produce: anger, happiness, sadness, heartbreak, you name it.  It's a game from 2001 and made for controllers, so its graphics and keyboard layout are a little lackluster and frustrating, but graphics don't always make the game.  After you're finished with the story, there's always loads of extra stuff to do like stat maxing, celestial weapons, and Blitzball (however I seem to be the only person that thoroughly enjoys Blitzball).  With the Steam version, the addition of the Function key hacks make grinding far more bearable, even though there are some things that still need to be ironed out that probably won't (would be nice if in battles when you have the speed hack active it would disable dialogue so there wouldn't be long pauses between moves when someone talks, and sometimes it takes a while for whatever reason before a fiend casts magic.  Would also be nice if Blitzball would be affected by the increase in speed because those games can drag a bit if you have an enormous lead with an OP team).\n\ntl;dr: Great game with an amazing story with lots to do. 10/10\n\nFinal Fantasy X-2\nThere's a lot of hate surrounding the game which I can understand I suppose, but it's pretty annoying to see all the time.  The game is focused around Yuna's story in a changed world from FFX.  Of course it'll be different.  FFX is an amazing game but the atmosphere after its ending would obviously be different.  There are several times in the game that makes me incredibly sad for her.  The percentage in relation to optional story missions makes exploring the game without a guide a LOT of fun (especially when I was a child and was still in awe by every video game I could find), and then playing with a guide is a lot of fun because there are several hidden things that would be near impossible to discover by yourself, not to mention the satisfaction of watching the percentage go up every few missions (be warned though: there are several guides that are wrong in their order/vague about what to do.  I haven't checked the guide on Steam so I can't say anything about that).  The Creature Creator is sort of tedious and obnoxious but is a great way to level grind/get more items that are exclusive to a single playthrough and whatnot.  The New Game+ option is great because then you can keep all of your stuff and ignore certain missions and choose a different side to experience another aspect of the game.  When I think of the FFX story, I pile the FFX-2 story with it because, in my opinion at least, the two complement each other nicely and make each other whole.\n\ntl;dr: Ignore the hate for X-2, it's a good game if you don't try to play it in the same way as FFX. 9/10","June 1","true","22.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

One of the best JRPGs and one of the best in the series which is what people will tell you.\nThe last time I played FFX was more than 10 years ago, and I only finished 1/3 of the game.

One of the greatest game almost left untouched along with some graphical enhancement is still one of the greatest game.\n\nNo need to review the content, so let's talk about this port :\n- The option to select the old or new music on start is really appreciated. (even if both are great in their own way)\n- About the graphics, this is great ! The textures and the scenes are awesome that way, there is only one downside in my opinion : I prefered some faces on the emulator (the old game with some enhancement algorithms and resolution hack)\n- Some content unrealesed  in our country bundled with the games\n- Seems pretty stable on my setup though I played it in borderless window, then I wouldn't be supprised if it has stability issues in fullscreen mode (many games do in case of multiple alt+tab -> resume fullscreen)","May 13","true","47.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game constantly crashed, and the glimpses I did get into game were at incredibly low fps, with many graphical glitches.\n\nIf this sounds like you, and you're using a laptop, the game might be using your integrated graphics card. Even though I had it set so that any application should automatically use my dedicated card, it was only ever using the integrated card for FFX, meaning it barely worked at all. There are plenty of guides online that can explain how to stop this better than I can, so go find them and you should be able to play!\n\nAbout the actual games: FFX is fantastic. If you've never played a Final Fantasy game before, but are looking for somewhere to start, I would say this game is the best entry point to the series, as well as the entire genre of JRPGs. It has a great story, interesting gameplay and some of the best music of the series.\n\nFFX-2 is...iffy. The story is pretty much a jumbled mess, unfortunately, but it has a few decent moments. Fortunately, it has interesting gameplay, and getting the chance to explore more of the world of Spira was enough to sell me on it.","May 13","true","2.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Not just for speedrunners, but for people who just love the gameplay and want to skip through the dialogue that they've heard many many times already.\n\nAuto-battle Game Booster: It makes sense that the developers wanted you to do certain battles on your own. The only thing that's annoying about the way they implemented it, is that it hard disables when you enter a mandatory battle; causing you to hit the button to re-enable it when the battle ends. Pretty annoying having to keep pressing the f3 key so often.\n\nBottom line: Without a doubt this is the best FFX-X2 yet.","May 15","true","3.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

(even if both are great in their own way)\n- About the graphics, this is great ! The textures and the scenes are awesome that way, there is only one downside in my opinion : I prefered some faces on the emulator (the old game with some enhancement algorithms and resolution hack)\n- Some content unrealesed  in our country bundled with the games\n- Seems pretty stable on my setup though I played it in borderless window, then I wouldn't be supprised if it has stability issues in fullscreen mode (many games do in case of multiple alt+tab -> resume fullscreen)","May 13","true","47.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game constantly crashed, and the glimpses I did get into game were at incredibly low fps, with many graphical glitches.\n\nIf this sounds like you, and you're using a laptop, the game might be using your integrated graphics card. Even though I had it set so that any application should automatically use my dedicated card, it was only ever using the integrated card for FFX, meaning it barely worked at all. There are plenty of guides online that can explain how to stop this better than I can, so go find them and you should be able to play!\n\nAbout the actual games: FFX is fantastic. If you've never played a Final Fantasy game before, but are looking for somewhere to start, I would say this game is the best entry point to the series, as well as the entire genre of JRPGs. It has a great story, interesting gameplay and some of the best music of the series.\n\nFFX-2 is...iffy. The story is pretty much a jumbled mess, unfortunately, but it has a few decent moments. Fortunately, it has interesting gameplay, and getting the chance to explore more of the world of Spira was enough to sell me on it.","May 13","true","2.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

FFX-2 is a steaming pile of garbage-flavoured garbage smothered in gatbage sauce with a nice bowl of garbage on the side)\n\n(Review based on FFX only, playing the games in order)\n\nThe camera is awkward in spots, hurray for unskippable cutscenes, and oh dear God that voice acting.\n\nThe redone graphics are mostly quite nice and the main characters look great, but you can see they didn't put nearly the effort into background/secondary characters(understandable, if slightly disappointing.) Not having played it since it's original PS2 release, I've forgot enough of the story that it feels fresh and engaging, even if I remember most of the big spoilers. I had honestly forgotten how much I enjoy this game, and am very happy to have it available once again.\n\nIs it a perfect game? Nope, not even when it was first released, but it is a fun, engaging game with some minor flaws, and annoying new gameplay issues (see dark anima, 'optional' bosses my a$$) that can be overlooked and is still reasonable value for money.\n\n(Review based on FFX-2)\n*vomits*\n\nRecommended with a  7/10 for FFX, and a (kill it with fire)/10 for FFX-2","May 15","true","96.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

A glitch happened where I changed resolutions in the game menu and windows was having a hissy fit and would not stop switching between resolutions.\n\nAlso the 30 fps framelock is honestly quite annoying I can run this game higher than 30 fps but for some reason the ingame menu has no problem running 61 fps...\n\nThe game was played on an Xbox 360 controller and all buttons were responsive except when I tried Aurons bushido I could not execute it properly. In my honest opinion the developers should include full controller support for a wider variety of controllers. This is Final Fantasy 10 after all.. one of the best selling final fantasies out there.\n\nThis game brings back alot of memories of good times in my life. After over 200+ hours alone of playing this game on the ps2 I was more than excited for this port and I was not disapointed. It was not day zero broken, or changed in many ways. I still had the final fantasy 10 feel to it as the same when I was a child. The game runs smoothly even after being at only 30 fps ( It doesnt bother me too much I just wish it could be higher)\n\nIn summary of my awesome review, This is not a bad PC port. I dont have a quirk for dual audio soo I decided to leave it off this review. I am for "right now"glad that this game was even ported to the PC soo I can once again play it.","May 12","true","2.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Square Enix has learned their lessons from porting multiple FF games to PC at this point. This isn't another FF 13, it works right out of the box with no issues that I've seen.\n\nFPS is locked at 30, but let's be real, the original cutscenes were also all 30 FPS and interpolation isn't going to do good things to them.\n\nWill report back and adjust my review if anything major comes up.

A glitch happened where I changed resolutions in the game menu and windows was having a hissy fit and would not stop switching between resolutions.\n\nAlso the 30 fps framelock is honestly quite annoying I can run this game higher than 30 fps but for some reason the ingame menu has no problem running 61 fps...\n\nThe game was played on an Xbox 360 controller and all buttons were responsive except when I tried Aurons bushido I could not execute it properly. In my honest opinion the developers should include full controller support for a wider variety of controllers. This is Final Fantasy 10 after all.. one of the best selling final fantasies out there.\n\nThis game brings back alot of memories of good times in my life. After over 200+ hours alone of playing this game on the ps2 I was more than excited for this port and I was not disapointed. It was not day zero broken, or changed in many ways. I still had the final fantasy 10 feel to it as the same when I was a child. The game runs smoothly even after being at only 30 fps ( It doesnt bother me too much I just wish it could be higher)\n\nIn summary of my awesome review, This is not a bad PC port. I dont have a quirk for dual audio soo I decided to leave it off this review. I am for "right now"glad that this game was even ported to the PC soo I can once again play it.","May 12","true","2.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Originally I dealt with multiple issues on simply getting the game to work on my high end pc rig. The game now runs fine and in full screen. To prevent the game being choppy and ultimately crashing I have moved my graphics down to low. This is what really made the game playable for me however I still feel a little begrudged playing a HD remake game on low graphics while I could be comfortably sat on my couch with the way more optimised PSVita version.\n\nThe game does now run a lot better and if you are a pc only kind of guy who does not have access to a console version of the game then I would more than recommend this version as it is still better than a life without FFX. However if you do have a PSVita (I believe there are PS3 and PS4 versions also), then I would highly recommend playing it on them instead. If i'm honest I didn't expect this version to be the definetive version and the majority of ports seem to be more lackluster than their console counterparts.\n\nGameplay wise this game is fantastic. I personally still own the PS2 versions of these games and also the original HD version on the PSVita and have still come back for more on steam. The characters are brilliant and the story is everything you expect from the Final Fantasy franchise (unless you jumped in on the XIII saga of games). Personally one of my favourite FF games after Crisis Core, 7 and 6 oooh and 9. Definitely a bargain for the amount of content within these games. £20 pounds will buy you hundreds of hours of content and if you can pick it up on a sale you are laughing.\n\nI hope to see more remakes and re-releases of classic JRPGs like this one on steam soon!","May 13","true","2.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

If you can't justify the price, Square will put it on sale for 50% by fall, and then $15 for FFX is a STEAL, and then you USE it like Rikku.\n\nOnion Knight/200 Lightning Strikes","May 18","true","39.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","2","0","0"

I've tried everything to get it to work, but unfortunately nothing solved my problem.\n\nHopefully Square Enix will come back with a patch for this game, I really want to experience this seemingly fantastic game without these constant issues.","June 4","false","12.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Sounds are awesome, gameplay is good and it's just a fun game to play.\nIf you can play it that is. The game tends to freeze during random times for no  appearant reason. There are many players who can't play the game because of this or other crashes, me included. The thing is, we're not going to play this game at all because Square Enix isn't going to fix the Problem. Their "costumer support" is on a level of " Have you tried turning it off and on again ?" and when you've exhausted their 3 ideas of help then you're welcome to a few rounds of " maybe it'll work the next time...".\n\nIf you have money to spare and you're lucky as f.... then give it a try and see how lucky you really are.\nIf you don't have money to spare, then don't buy this game.","June 6","false","11.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I've read that a lot of people are having issues with their video syncing with the audio or the game crashing quite often. I'm hoping for a patch in the near future. I'm using a brand new gaming laptop with nice specs (haven't had any issue with any other games). I'd like to play one of my favorite Final Fantasy games in the series, but this crashing 20 seconds in is frustrating.\n\nI highly recommend this game on PS2!
