You walk around and suddenly some of your collegues turn into zombies. In the beginning your only weapon are paperballs. Coffee makes you going faster and herbal tea reduces your stress level. You get more stress if you are hit by zombies. And waterspenders are your savepoints. Hilarious: speak to your "normal" collegues and you will see how calm they are. They are so deep into work that they don't even freakout in a zombicalypse. Additional you earn each minutes 10 USD salary. Use it on vendor machines to buy grenades and powerups. Climb up the career ladder, earn more salary, finish some side quests and you will beat this game sometime. I also liked the soundtrack very much.","December 17, 2015","true","0.5"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","13","16","2","1"

The K & M are ok for the time being though.\n\nThe humor is kind of hit or miss, but ultimately the game is cheap and relatively fun to play.  Will be nice to see what new features or improvements the developer makes once he's able to get back to improving the game..","February 18","true","0.4"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

The levels are large and there are plenty of items and side-quests.\n\nOne thing that would make this game better is controller support but coming from an MMO background I don't mind using WASD and using the mouse to click on icons.\n\nGood job","December 8, 2015","true","8.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

The base gameplay is too outdated and could use a lot of added features. Not even adding more to the story or more quests, etc. will make this game more fun; it is bland and too simple. Does a great job capturing the theme of Zombies in an Office workplace.\nThis is not the kind of game I’d play in my free time, but it’s a great example game to put in one’s game design portfolio.\n","February 15","true","0.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has huge potential and the developer is very receptive to feedback.\n\nThe new controls make the game much more playable, and it's fun to navigate around the office, pushing chairs in the way of zombies, setting up barricades and mines etc. The dialogue is hilarious. In many RPG's going through dialogue can be a chore, but here it's great and makes me want to initiate conversation with all the NPCs.\n\nI'm currently not a fan of the way zombies spawn, and there are a few little niggles like collisions that aren't perfect.\n\nI would highly recommend downloading this game and leaving detailed feedback to the developer, as the gameplay gets much more refined with each update.","January 21","true","1.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The controls are awfull. Pad is not even halfly supported, yet (basic-buttons are ok, but no quickmenueitemfire, d-pad doesnt work, other keys seem to be effectless).\nZombies respawn suddenly. At least items respawn, too (at least if u reload from savepoint cant tell since I "stressed out" permanently :P).\nThe game became boring and with this controls even bugging after a few minutes.\n\nMaybe you like it as an not so usual version, if you are into this kind of games.

If you gain enough stress, you turn into a zombie and you lose. Advance as long as you can and defend yourself by throwing paper balls. The average working man and/or woman would be able to appriciate this game because its simplicity and humor and overall solid design. The theme is relevant and the game itself is fun!

Horrible execution.\nVery clunky targeting, no excuse why it should be this ♥♥♥♥♥.\nHolding a special key to toggle your aim one direction while moving in another, but all of your visual cues are wrong.\n\nOther games do zombie crap better.\n\nThe developers are listening to feedback. And they're decidedly nice about it. My main issue was with the controls and lack of visual cues. They modified the controls and it's significantly more familiar, enabling one to step into the roll of office peon with minimal fuss.\nThe item system hints at fun future possibilities for office warfare.\nThe quests tasks are relatively straightforward. They're even working on some laidback humour.\n\nThe difference between the first play and the second play are night and day, and I am rather enamored with the game now.","December 19, 2015","true","1.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

Makes for odd placement and handling at first go.\nGraphic options are limited\nEdit: Stats have been posted in the forum.","December 29, 2015","true","3.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

Favourite weapon is the mine. Although I just picked up some paperclips which are quite handy. Think that the spawning can be a bit annoying sometimes if you have low health and you duck round a corner or behind an obstacle only a for a zombie to spawn in front of you.\n\nThere's an awesome boss battle when you make it to the carpark... thats about as far as I've got so far.. I hope there is more suprises in store :)\n\nSupport for a gamepad would be cool.","December 31, 2015","true","1.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
