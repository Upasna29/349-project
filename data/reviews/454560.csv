Early access games means that It's a work in progress. meaning not complete. When you people buy an early access title your basically helping the developers with developing the game. I would wait until a few months have gone by before giving this game a negative review. Wait until the developers have had a chance to add features and start fixing the bugs. I mean guys really stop acting like a bunch of jerks. Sure this game is not ready yet but that's what early acecess is about.","May 8","true","1.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

There is a lot to be done before this is ready to leave EA.\n\nUltimate Fight Manager 2016 blends RT with management as you manage your own gym and fighters in a MMA world. Build your gym staff, look after training schedules and fights, hire fighters, and buy equipment. These are the options at EA launch to play around with. You can challenge your friends or others in training fights at the moment, but you can not affect any strategy changes or offer corner advice during a fight. This is on the update list.\n\nThe game has an extensive update list that is free to view in the forum and I see that it could be a game title for MMA similar to how Football Manager is a popular title for sim-management football.\n\nAs of 30th April 2016. I recommend this as a purchase IF you are prepared to offer feedback to the devs, and are willing to be part of the Early Access process. This isn't a complete game with all the features. This is a game with only some of the features as shown. You can enjoy some of the basics, plan fights against others online, or against the AI.\n\nThis review will be added to as the game progresses through EA towards full-game launch.","April 30","true","6.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

He already asked people what features they would like to see implemented, and has taken note.\nThis is definitely one to look for in the future, but as of right now it needs a loving hand from the developer.","April 29","false","1.2"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

Cause, u know, is it a joke or something? 10 freaking bucks for 10 pictures and 8 menu tabs w/o any control of gameplay, w/o any financial, strategic, gym / w.e. reports? 10 bucks for 45 minutes of waiting for next fight w/o any chance to see it in "record" if u missed it for some reason? U really think its funny or what? Saying im shoked is saying nothing, u know... But im shoked even more by Steam's team unability to check what they really got on their market. Shame on u guys.","May 7","false","0.7"," 1 of 12 people (8%) found this review helpful","8","1","12","0","3"
