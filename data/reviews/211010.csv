It bounces between leveling you up and giving you new guns, so that you continually feel like you are becoming more awesome.  The guns are varied and pretty insane at the higher levels, and it feels good to mow down 100s of enemies in that constant march forward.\n\nThe game is around 2 hours in length for the first campaign playthrough, which feels about right for the game.  And you can always play the other modes or try to boost your score with an additional playthrough to get on the leaderboards if you want to spend more time with it.\n\nAlso the boss fights are pretty great, I like the fact that they don't turn the gameplay on it's head.  They feel like they really belong in the game, while also adding a bit more of a challenge.\n\nWould buy again.","February 18, 2014","true","3.5"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","17","17","0","0"

FEATURING:	THE ALIEN SHOOTER SERIES	Company Name:\nWhat Do They Mostly Do:\nWhere are they Now:	Sigma Team\nMaking horde mode style videogame, Forever!\nMaking Mobile Games!\nIntroOh darn it, should have started from Alien Shooter 1 but whatever -shrug-\n\nSo Alien Shooter series... if you had a computer back in the year 2000-20005 you probably heard of and played this game which was made by a russian team. Against all odds [and mostly because we dont have that many good action games back then] the game became quite famous and is probably one of those game that holds the most amount of sequel with barely any differences in between the series.\n\nWith that said if you know what Alien Shooter is and probably want to validate your opinion on this game before buying it and killing hordes of aliens feel free to skip this section, I will talking about what the series mainly is.\n\nNow let me get this out of the way first, the game is old, ancient, archaic, obsolete, and fun. Which means you will encounter graphics from the early 2000s because this game is made in the early 2000s. Now shut up about the terrible graphics on the store page and listen.\n\nBasically Alien Shooter series has you controlling a mute guy or gal who usually is either a mercenary or some other form of that. In the early game of Alien Shooter the guy has more health while the gal runs faster, easy. The newer ones might give you some preset personality and background and you can now upgrade your charcater stats. Still the same. Now the game is basically you taking this person and using the whole lotta weapons to kill aliens. Lots and lots and lots of aliens. Back  when it was release the amount of gib was pretty f***ing impressive because once you kill an alien the corpse will not despawn so you will see the map covered in literal amount of gore and gib. The game is so old [and the engine basically retooled over and over again from Alien Shooter 1] that you cannot even turn the camera, yes the background is static 2D with only the character and alien being 3D and every single alien has a canned animation in the way they die. Hahahah.\n\nAnd that is pretty there is to the game. Some version added objective then the next one improved on it by adding a story and finally you have a full blown campaign while still shooting aliens endlessly. There is something so heartwarming shooting and killing aliens across so many games. Its like a pair of well worn mitten that you slip on before drinking tea and engaging alien genocide. That is not to say the game isn't without its fair share of issues no. The camera angle is bad, sometimes the geometry decides to eat you, and progression in some of the game are f***ed because of how rushed the developement is. But hey it is still fun to shoot and kill aliens.\n\nALIEN SHOOTER: CONSCRIPTIONRelease after reloaded yet features a far more shooter story, less weapon, and less time to level up and get more weapons so by the time you reach the final boss [who is pretty frickin dissapointing if I may add] you are probably quite underleveled and underarmed unless you pick the hidden area perk because in every single Alien Shooter hidden areas mean = money, guns, free armor.\n\nI honestly feel after finishing this in just over 2.30 hour that this is one of the weaker game in the second series. Reloaded gave us a full campaign, a narrative that ends properly, more level to grind and weapon to buy, plus a ,pre varied setting.\n\nIn contrast Conscription narrative is a bit bland, disjointed, and just ends like that. It actually feels like you should play Conscription first before Reloaded because of the quality jump. Plus it's also shorter. So lets jump to the verdict.\n\n\nConclusionNew Buyers: Familiarize yourself with the AlienShooter series before deciding to pull the trigger [heh] and buy the game. I suggest Alien Shooter 1, Conscription then Reloaded because of the quality and because those are the only ones on steam.\n\nVeteran Player: Better than some worse than some. Harder than most because of the short money collection and exp farming but otherwised the same donut filling with a different layer of doughnut.\n\nPretty much that will be all. Hope to see you on Reloaded! [and maybe 1 but dear lord that is so archaic and ancient.]\n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention, no controller, 60 fps most of the time but due to the way the engine was made too much explosion will still reduce it to 15 for a few sec and it runs on a toaster. Literally Intel 4000 can play it. The keyboard control is good to. Sounds are pretty basic and I am pretty sure they just recycle it over and over again.\n\nHere at Just Review\nWe Just Review Games~\n[God that was lame, feel free to follow us!]\nNo drama, Just Reviews","January 8","true","2.7"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","9","14","0","0"

Alien shooter is an isometric 2D game that floods the screen with often hundreds of aliens to fight at once, requiring you to constantly upgrade your characters stats and kit, kinda like an action RPG. The best thing about the game by far is the array of different weapons, with there always being something else to aim for. You can often make the trade off between very slow but hard hitting weapons (rocket launchers, some of the energy weapons etc) or the opposite scale of extremely fast firing weapons (uzi, machine guns, mini guns, plasma gatlin guns! etc).\n\nBasically, if you get a free evening and all you want to do is mindless violence, this will satisfy your needs nicely!","January 28, 2014","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's the same base game - same graphics and gameplay - with a different story and different levels.\n\nWhich is to say that Alien Shooter 2 Conscription is an amazing game, just as Alien Shooter 2: Reloaded was as well. It's just as fun and action-packed as its predecessor was.\n\nThat said, there are some things that Reloaded did better... For some reason, Conscription removed the different playable characters (which had different starting attributes). Enemy variety seems to be a little smaller well and it's a lot more linear, with less sidequests.\n\nStill highly recommended, but Reloaded is still the best out of the three games in the Alien Shooter series.\n\nOne thing I'd like to see if they ever made another Alien Shooter game is to have its gameplay combined with Action RPG elements... Randomly generated equipment and levels (including items with different rarity levels), skills to use, etc. I personally believe it would be a huge improvement to this already awesome series.\n\nAnd as with the first two games, camera angle is still an issue once more. Same issues: fixed camera angle and lack of transparency effect will make it that some items and enemies won't be seen by the player because they'll show up behind walls.","February 18, 2015","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I only had 1 CTD and no bugs, but had to disable vsync from ini file, game was very laggy with it.","November 25, 2015","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
