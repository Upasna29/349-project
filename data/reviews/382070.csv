Although I would like to mention there are some bugs here and there. For example\n-If a box was below you and you reversed the gravity you would fly up a bit then the box would teleport above you.\n-This game doesn't run really well in fullscreen and lags (at least for my computer).\n-The "E" button does not really have a lot of function to it except acting like a torch.\n-Some levels are confusing and takes you a while to figure out what to do.\n-After maximizing the game, clicking the minimize button will not minimize the game but instead reduce the lag I experience.\n-After reaching the harder levels, some levels are just so tough you need a lot of luck to get through them\n-On one specific level which I do not remember, it was the one with a ball and lazers and 2 switches which you have to time to activate the exit door. I glitched out the switches and had to restart the whole level which sucked.\n\n\nThat's it, I would recommend this game to anyone who have not yet tried platforming games but though I doubt they would get very far without experience in platforming games, as I have played tons of platforming games in the past.","October 8, 2015","true","5.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

You know, it has that small thing that called the "charm". It's challenging, engaging and has a pleasant look, while it's made by just a single person. The most interesting thing to me is a very simple-to-use level editor, so you can create your own set of maps and put it to the Workshop. All in all, I really recommend this game, as it's totally worth the money.","October 11, 2015","true","1.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I feel like if it were visually better, and more well optimised it would easily be able to be sold as a $15-20 game. The game is hard, but it never feels like the games fault, only your fault. I also love the multiplayer option. A LOT of fun to play with a friend. It's funny, I found this game trying to prove to a friend that most of the new releases/under $5 games weren't bad. I can't believe this game is only $1 I love it.\n\n15/20","October 3, 2015","true","35.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

Tried to at least get some enjoyment out of this but all the bosses I played are awful and the levels don't tend to be much better.\n\nThe controls are really stiff and the game expects rather precise platforming out of you on a few occasions, random difficulty spikes in an otherwise kind of tame platforming game. A fair few of the levels are pretty tedious, to boot; one level I played had me going back three times through the same area to move cubes around, with basically no danger, followed up by a relatively dangerous two sections afterwards. That doesn't make a game harder, it just makes it more boring.\n\nThe bosses, though. The first one is... okay, if not a little broken. The second is basically chance, you have to jump early and pray that you get the exact angle you need, and the boss is completely random so he can dodge out of the way of a successful attack sometimes, or spend a lot of time using attacks where you can't fight back. The third, though... a loooong autoscroll that only has real danger about a minute in, and then a moment that was as far as I got where you have to press a button and then go BACKWARDS to grab a cube. At that level of failing to understand basic game design, I just up and quit. Not worth my time, nor my money.\n\nThe aesthetic is decent, though not that special, and the soundtrack is okay as well. But I was just not getting any enjoyment out of this, even for the low price tag.\n\nEDIT: I'm persistent as heck so I went and finished the game. It doesn't get better. There's a pure trial-and-error level that you literally have to replay until you've memorized, a ton of really picky platforming bits combined with the game's awful auto-jump and touchy engine, the final boss has a huge RNG element to it, a lot of levels go on too long for their own good, a few levels have puzzles where failure means restarting after you've already gone through a platforming segment to get to the puzzles, there's overly powerful rocket launchers eventually introduced, some wonky physics stuff with the booster panels, the falling blocks are used horribly in some places, placed at the end of levels with tricky jumps where failure means a full restart... the list just goes on and on, in only 50 levels + 5 bosses there are so many poor game design choices that I just couldn't wring any enjoyment out of this whatsoever.","November 28, 2015","false","4.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It encompasses game mechanics similar to The Impossible Game whilst being more than just a linear platformer. It's hard to play this game for extended amounts of time; however, it's rather enjoyable in short sittings. Overall, I was happily suprised with this game and array of features it came with. Thanks to the in-game level editor and compatibility with Steam Workshop, there's no shortage of content for this Indie adventure.","October 24, 2015","true","7.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sknowman/recommended/382070/","Sknowman","Sknowman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sknowman/","159 products in account","I went into this game thinking it was a puzzle game with platform elements.\n\nIt turns out it is almost entirely a platformer, with maybe two or three puzzles ("Solve 50 unique puzzles on your way"? yeah right). Oh, and one of those puzzles uses mechanics that you aren't introduced to at all. There is no explanation of it, which leads to you having to figure out the complicated mess out on your own. Usually that's not a big deal (especially since I enjoy actual puzzles), but trial and error was made difficult by needing to pass part of the level before you can even attempt the puzzle.\n\nThe boss battles aren't very difficult, and are nice additions. Except for the lass boss, which is one of the most frustrating bosses I've ever faced. The boss is actually very easy, all you need to do is dodge some stuff. But he randomly uses a pulse, which is 99% guaranteed to push you into debris; there is also no way to tell when he's about to do it, so it's unavoidable. In other words, you just have to hope that he doesn't use it.\n\n*End rant*\n\nThe first 40 levels or so of the game aren't bad. In fact, I enjoyed it. Sure, it was all platforming when I expected puzzles, but that wasn't a huge deal. It was fun.\n\nThe last 10 levels and the final boss ruin this game. There are ridiculous timing-based events and several parts that require luck, making the overall experience more frustrating than it's worth.","November 10, 2015","false","4.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"
