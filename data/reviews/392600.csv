You take on the role of trimoebas, triangular unicellular organisms, in each level, and you must use your wits to "unlock" the next level by aligning the keys on the trimoebas with the doors. Gameplay consists of alternating control between trimoebas and rolling them so that you can line up the key on one side of the trimoeba with the door (depicted as a colored line in game) to get to the next level. Gameplay is thus slowpaced and recommended to think carefully before every move. Hazards such as glue or explosives in levels can mean a restart if you make the wrong move.\n\n═══════════════════════════════════\nPROS & CONS\n\nPros:\nBeautiful waterpainted illustrations\n250 levels in increasing difficulty means long play time\nEasy to start and stop\nDetailed tutorials help ease you into new game mechanics\n\nCons:\nI would have preferred a undo last move option\nStory doesn't really make sense but it is not important for puzzle games like this one\n═══════════════════════════════════\nSUMMARY & FINAL RATING\n\nChallenging unique puzzle game well worth the price. Currently with 250 levels to complete and maybe more later, along with the possibility of user generated content!\n\n═══════════════════════════════════\nFor more recommendations on quality indie games or ones with high potential follow our group reviews  here","December 9, 2015","true","8.0"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","18","24","0","0"

When playing through I couldn’t help should out illuminati! I have attached my video preview to give you a better idea of the game and I will list down what I liked and what I didn’t like.\n\nLikes:\nUnique Puzzler which really gets your brain going\nBeautiful colours\nDifferent types of Trimoebas and the different stages to overcome\nTutorial doesn’t slow you down or halt your speed\nilluminati\nLots of content for price you’re paying\n\nDislikes:\nHard to navigate through menu (Not clear enough how to back out)\nDifficulty increased very quickly and sometimes left me frustrated\n\nOverall, I had a really fun time playing the game and could easily recommend it to anyone who loves Puzzlers. The game does get really difficult so anyone new to puzzlers or prone to frustration may want to avoid this.\n","December 7, 2015","true","6.0"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","13","17","0","1"

Although, supposedly it could be "The hexagonal illuminati!"... Lets just say they are watching you :)\n\nAnyway,\nIt's colourful puzzle game where the puzzles are not too hard to complete so that the game is fun. The triangles and its surface type are probably the most important thing in this game. Most of it is self-explanatory or explained in the visuals. There are a few things that are slightly harder to work out to start with, for example the back button to the options menu is the eye. The eye is probably the second best thing in this game.\n\nOverall, I'd say it’s a fun game where enough of the puzzles are not too boring and still quite challenging. You will not complete this game quickly at all and some levels get quite hard but still fun. The menu does look nice but sometimes it can be hard to understand..\n\nA tip: The orange triangles on the menu are skip tokens that let you skip a level but they do come back if you complete that level later. This allows you to skip past any really hard levels so you can still have fun.","December 7, 2015","true","1.5"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","7","10","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DariusRaider/recommended/392600/","DariusRaider","DariusOne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DariusRaider/","1156 products in account","For a seemingly small and basic puzzle game Volvox has quite a bit going for itself. Firstly the main mechanic of spinning triangles around is both very enjoyable and actually quite deep. Moving the little things around is accurate and fast enough to not get frustrating while still making sure you get what just happened.  Secondly the level design is great and really gets everything out of the main mechanics. From the first 80 levels I really didn´t feel like I was doing the same stuff over and over, as is often the case with such puzzle games. Thirdly yeah there is a ton of content, some 250ish levels that one cannot just walk through.\n\nVisually the game is painless to look at. As said the controls work well so that´s the most important part and past that it´s perfectly functional. Same goes for the music.\n\nNow the biggest issue with this game is that predicting what´s going happen gets really difficult in certain situations/long sequences, and often these are situation that send you right back to the beginning of the puzzle. In very rare instances that gets overly frustrating with trying to remember exactly what you did and what more you want to test. The difficulty itself is on the harder side but reasonable and very rewarding. Others have said the same thing but an Undo button would fix the issue.\n\nFor a conclusion right now Volvox is a great example of its genres harder side, and really shines in level desing.","February 4","true","13.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Charming art direction mixed with brutally complex levels, where you have to roll this triangle things till a specific spot, creating structures in between. It requires a lot of mental flexibility and the ability to deal with a lot of "pieces" at the same time. Highly recommended as a "companion game", for short but intense plays.","December 30, 2015","true","21.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It's an indie title by an Italian developer that's all about little triangles. They are called Trimoebas and are always looking at you with their big eyes. Your task is to rotate them in the right way and it's way harder and more challenging than you might expect.\n\nThe game is coming with 250 different levels and the difficulty level is rising pretty fast. But they give you tutorial levels where each new ability and challenge is explained. What's also great about Volvox is its unique watercolor graphic style and the nice, relaxing music. :)\n\nRight now I'm only into world 2 (meaning about 30 levels) but the game concept is intriguing and like said before, very (!) challenging.\n\nIf you're curious or thinking about getting it for yourselves, you could look at the first part of my Let's Play, where I show the first levels of the game. :)\n\nVolvox Part 1 - Tricky little Triangles","December 20, 2015","true","2.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Every puzzle is a new step in the long journey to form various organisms. You have to make the Trimoebas “roll” to create more complex structures as you progress in the game, and you will use their special properties (like glue and explosion...) to solve challenging puzzles.\nThe fantastic backgrounds and the music (composed with the hang) are shiny gems hidden in this treasure. And the name of the treasure is... Volvox.\nYou can't miss it, if you loved games like Lemmings and Incredipede. Well, you can't miss it if you love games in general!","December 7, 2015","true","14.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The mechanics are simple: you have to correctly position a series of triangular creatures called Trimoebas. In doing so, you will build the first multicellular beings.\n\nThe first levels are easy, but later you will find the game really challenging and rewarding. Also, the music and the atmosphere is really charming and accompanies the player pleasently.\n\nI would suggest this game to everyone who loves logic games and puzzles with an unique and "auteur" look.","December 9, 2015","true","0.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Inspired by biologic concepts like cells and enzymes, Volvox asks you to move and orient little triangle sized critters.\n\nThe premise is deceptively simple, but it turns out to be more challenging and compelling than one might expect. If you like Lemmings or similar games, you'll probably like Volvox. I have enjoyed my time with it so far.","February 2","true","1.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You control some triangle shaped 'trimoebas' in order to match keys with locks.\n\nPROS:\n- Interesting and engaging puzzles.\n- Good art style. And by that I mean it's aesthetically pleasing.\n- Enjoyable soundtrack.\n\nCONS:\n- There is no 'undo last move' option which could be frustrating.\n- Not much going on story wise, but it's a puzzle game, so who cares.\n\nThe very first time you start the game, the menu is sort of confusing, but you should quickly get the hang of it.\nI personally enjoyed it very much! It is really fun, and to be honest I respect a game that rewards a bit of geometric know-how. Definitely worth buying, considering the amount of content inside and the quality of execution. Also there will probably be updates coming.\n\nDisclosure:\nI was provided a key for the game by the developer, for the purpose of putting my opinion in written form in a review.","February 5","true","1.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
