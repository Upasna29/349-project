"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DirtyFilthBagOfDirt/recommended/347720/","DirtyFilthBagOfDirt","Strangler","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DirtyFilthBagOfDirt/","372 products in account","I feel the need to clarify. This game is not art, it's ridiculous. It obviously doesn't appeal to everybody. What you'd be buying is essentially a better version of LSD Dream Emulator, if you don't find that concept interesting already, this isn't for you. I just want readers to understand my position before going into this, I like new ideas and interesting concepts, and I think games should be allowed to be whatever their creators please. People who feel the same way as me will probably get quite a bit out of this game.\n\nSoda Drinker Pro was initially released in 2008 after it's short development time of one day. Now I've always thought ♥♥♥♥ like this was nonsense and shouldn't even cost money, but over the years it's been worked on and actually has an awful lot of content in it now. I never thought my purchase of digital Soda Drinking Simulation would eventually provide me with an interesting and enjoyable experience.\n\nNo, I'm not talking about Soda Drinker Pro. For some reason, the dude who made this decided to take his Malware looking joke program and put an actual video game in it, it used to be that you had to stare a rock for about 3 minutes in order to get into the secret game, but I believe the method has changed now. In this game, you play as a raindrop and touch different objects, turning into whatever you touch. If you know LSD dream emulator, imagine it being like that but with continuety, things to do and an awful lot of work put into it. And honestly, as I played more of Vivian clark, the secret game, I started to warm up more to the idea of Soda Drinker Pro itself. A game that looks like another one of those worthless "simulator" games that nobody likes, but has a cult following because of Vivian Clark.\n\nThe most you're gonna get out of Soda Drinker Pro is some laughs with your friends, exploring and listening to all the bizarre nonsense it has. If you want a better version of Soda Drinker Pro, then buy Soda Drinker Pro and play Vivian Clark.\n\nFeel me?","April 14","true","4.1"," 76 of 114 people (67%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","67","76","114","8","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/premiumfootwear/recommended/347720/","premiumfootwear","Gaige","http://steamcommunity.com/id/premiumfootwear/","141 products in account","What a ridiculous game. That pretty much summarizes the reaction I had when I first saw Soda Drinker Pro in action. The game really just serves as a front for the real game, Vivian Clark. I found this to be a strange design decision, but given the absurd nature of this game, I guess it fits well.\n\nSoda Drinker Pro is a joke, through and through. There really isn't anything redeeming about it in terms of gameplay, but I was impressed by the fact that seemingly every level has a line recorded about that level when it starts up. That alone probably took a few hours to record.\n\nVivian Clark, on the other hand, is an artsy little game that reminds me heavily of Wario Ware. You go back and forth between goofy minigames that are as fun as they are outrageous. These minigames connect to other ones, usually by bumping into an object or even by failing in a certain way, which creates a maze for the player to navigate through. Vivian Clark is very much a maze of minigames that tests your memory as you try to figure out how to get back to game X to continue exploring new ones you haven't discovered yet.\n\nSo do I recommend this game? Yeah, I think so. It's a fun little game to show off to friends or stream. I'd wait for a sale to pick it up though, because I think the entertainment it offers is pretty limited.","May 12","true","0.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","6","8","2","0"

The product being advertised is pretty lame though, and I feel the best I can say about it is that more effort than I assumed was put into it. The levels go pretty deep and there's different audio (and sometimes music) for every stage.","June 2","false","9.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NekuCerv/recommended/347720/","NekuCerv","Ubersaw Medic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NekuCerv/","189 products in account","(CONTEXT: Only saw the trailer before playing the game, so maybe I'm missing some crucial inside jokes)\n\nEDIT: Welp, seems I actually missed an inside joke, so this review below only applies for the SDPro part of the game. If you're reading this remember to check out level 2 extensively for the actual, pretty cool, super-secret game!\n\nThis game is probably one of the more confusing and frustrating experiences I've played ever, not because it's 100%, unsalvagebly bad but because it has some genious elements drowned in a sea of boringness and contradictory gameplay decisions that in the end just don't work.\n\nFirst of all, the positives:\n\n-Music: If there's something that shines on this game it's the music. There's over 120 tracks of a guy singing about how he loves soda and it doesn't get stale at all, just the oposite, it became the only reason I played through the whole game, just to see what the next music sounds like. So bravo, sound design guy :D\n\n-Some of the levels: There are a few levels that were pretty interesting, like 2 and 69 from the top of my head, and a few more that the concept was pretty funny/bizarre/dissonant with the previous level that really made me burst out laughing.\n\n-Soda Drinking: Duh. Probably one of the smartest choices was letting you advance to the next level whenever you want after a short forced period of exploring, kind of like the camera part of Sonic Dreams Collection (which you should probably play), specially considering on how many levels you can fall off the map.\n\n-Hugely configurable Soda: Cafeine is not too healthy for me so it's nice that they included caffeine-free soda alternatives :)\n\nNegatives:\n\n-The walk speed: Uuuuuuuuurgh. The worst part of all is that the dev definitely intentionally screws with the player in this front, as in some levels you can only walk at a decent pace while going sideways or even backwards, like in Big Rigs (which is not too far off from this game, actually :D), and it changes on a per-level basis, so it gets even more anoying by making you check which is the correct way of walking before actually exploring a level.\n\n-Slurping makes you unable to hear what the songs are saying: Which can be "fixed" with a bug that makes you able to drink soda silently but it's still not a good idea to make the more entretaining part of the game harder to experience.\n\n-Generally Bland Levels: And here's the main problem I had, the levels where waaaaaaaay too empty, specially after Level 2 being so jam-packed with awesome secrets which set your expectations waaaaaaaay too high, and with the walk speed being waaaaaaaay too low which forces you to strafe-walk, which in turn ends up with you looking at a wall for 50% of the time you're playing.\n\n-The mouse isn't hidden when playing: Ha ha, what a chuckle-worthy amateur ironic inconvenience we did that every other bad game developer also does. Still doesn't make it less annoying though.\n\nIn conclusion, this could have been a great game, relegated to a one-off, 2-hour long joke and it's kind of tragic in a way :P. My best regards to the developer for trying to make an actually interesting joke game, but the lack of content really makes me not able to recomend this to someone else.\n\n\nThough it's perfect if you're looking for a game to make some Youtube vids for your chanel :D\n\n(The secret game was pretty cool too)","April 14","false","2.7"," 84 of 166 people (51%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","51","84","166","13","7"
