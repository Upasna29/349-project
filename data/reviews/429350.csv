These features are complemented with a great looking set of pixel art, a pretty fitting soundtrack and what could be described as a retro inspired sci-fi setting.\n\nYou play as an office worker who is captured by aliens and taken aboard the Satellite Moebius, an arena where you’ll have to fight for your life against waves of alien enemies. The concept is pretty simple, your objective is to, hopefully, get out of the arena alive but while attempting to achieve that goal you’ll also have to entertain the alien crowd. As you start killing enemies in quick succession the crowd will eventually start throwing power ups and weapons into the arena, so it is in your best interest to kill as many enemies as quickly as possible.\n\nUpon entering the game you’ll have to choose one of 3 doors to enter, with each one leading you through a different path and eventually to a different boss. If you manage to defeat the boss you’ll be able to choose one of 3 different upgrades and after that you’ll be teleported to the first room and you’ll be prompted to enter one of the two remaining doors. This time the path you’ll choose will have more and thougher enemies and if you manage to the defeat the second boss the process repeats itself, eventually leading to a final boss. Each one of these paths has a different colour assigned to them, and it is that colour which will determine what kind of coins enemies drop when they die. Once you get a certain amount of them you’ll unlock new items.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, Satellite Rush is pretty straightforward and anyone that has played Isaac or any other game in this genre will feel right at home. The only thing I believe I’ve never saw in other games like this is the fact that when you shoot your character actually slows down, so you can’t just run around shooting enemies while they follow you because they might catch up. You use WASD to move around, arrow keys to shoot and you also have a designated key to pick up and use items. In terms of weapons, while you’ll most likely spend a lot of your time with the basic pistol, you’ll also spend a lot of time with weapons the crowd throws at you such as, machine guns, shotungs, rocket launchers, flame throwers, and other sorts of crazy weapons such as laser based weapons that fire in a V shape. Besides that, the crowd will also give you power ups which are a one time consumable item such as, bombs and shields. Considering you’ll be able to keep the alien crowd entertained, the gameplay will vary a lot, one second you’ll be firing rockets from afar against enemies that explode when die they and the next second you’ll pick up a shotgun and you’ll have to go close to the enemies in order for the bullets to actually hit them.\n\nSatellite Rush is a pretty fun game to play given the fact that is still in early access, and that kind of leads to one of my complaints about the game. As of right now, you’ll probably see everything the game has to offer in less than 10 hours, but I’m hoping that before the game releases it will have more enemy types (which there are quite a few already), more power ups, more boss types, more weapons and perhaps a little bit more of variety in each level.\n\nOverall, I think that for its current price there is no going wrong with this one, especially if you’re a fan of the genre. It manages to keep the gameplay diversified enough so that you don’t feel like you’re doing the same thing over and over (even though you kind of are) and the game seems to go towards a humorous retro setting. If you’re not sure you’ll enjoy it just pick it up and if under 2 hours the game doesn’t manage to grab you just ask for a refund, for me all it took was a few minutes.\n\nThis review is part of the Steamified Community Review program.

You choose from a red, green or blue door, then have to clear out a series of randomly allocated arenas, and finally a boss. Repeat until you've won all three doors.\n\nThe crowd thrill meter at the top is a clever way of adding urgency to the game. If you string together kills, the meter goes up into the rewards zone, and cool temporary weapons will spawn in the arena. But it will continually tick back down again, forcing you onwards. I'd like to see them do more with this concept.\n\nGameplay review video, including two bosses:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5vILZ3g9Nc\n\nI liked how the aliens have a variety of attacks to learn, encouraging you to come up with strategies such as who you'll need to kill first. But there needs to be more enemy types - some of the existing ones are a little dull.\n\nThe persistent unlockable system is a familiar way to encourage you to play again, and the door choice at the start allows you to focus on the upgrades that suit your play style, which is cool.\n\nBut the runs behind each type of door don't feel hugely different, which is a shame. A much wider selection of arenas and level styles seems crucial for long-term replayability.\n\nAlso, the control of the player isn't very slick, with eight directions of movement (and only four to shoot). He can feel lumbering and unable to dodge stuff. It helps that you run faster when not shooting, but getting out of a tight spot is often just not possible.\n\nAs is often the case with action-roguelikes, the game starts off slow and gets more exciting as it goes, so once you've played the game a few times the early parts can feel like a chore to get through. The game takes off once you've got the crowd meter high enough for weapons, but if you get the wrong arenas, this might take a while.\n\nThe bosses are tough, so they're satisfying to beat. Some of the bullet hells are a little silly, given your character isn't that manouverable, but bosses do become much more beatable with practice.\n\nSo overall, it's got a few problems - one of the major ones should be addressed by new content being added over the course of early access, but it's the basic control of your character that might put people off. I enjoyed the game enough for it not to bother me too much, especially given its value price point.\n\n* More indie gaming videos by Randomise User","April 2","true","3.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Spoilers!!\nsteamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=662082130\nPS: I recorded before I got the steam key. Steam's linux version is working fine but the intro and ending videos didn't work.\n\nI've been following this guys since they were greenlit.\nGame is kinda hard, but I think that is intention. It's not impossible, so with practice and patience you can beat it.\n\nThere are 3 corridors leading to a boss. After beating a boss the next corridor will be extended. After defeating the 3, an  exit door will appear. Just run through the corridor, then you will find the last boss. The faster you kill the easier it gets because the crowd throws weapons/itens for you to use. At the begging you can get a machine gun, shotgun and a rocket launcher, and the item is a timed bomb. Be careful with the rocket launcher and timed bomb so that you won't blow yourself.\n\nThe corridor have emblems that can be acquired after killing an enemy. Each corridor has different colorred emblens, so they lead to different upgrades. After 500 a new weapon will be released (v blaster, missle launcher and flamethrower), then with 1500 a new item will be released (Health orb, shield and time warp). I couldn't beat the game without the Health Orb, some times there is just too much stuff and you can't avoid been hit. I prefer to keep a health orb instead of the other items.\n\nBe carefull with the pink slime, when it dies it makes a small explosion. The enraged floating shooting thing shoots too many projectiles. Use the bomb enemies to kill other enemies.\n\nAfter beating a boss you can choose 1 of the 3 upgrades by leaving the boss remains to the altar. Upgrades are Life Up, Fire Rate, and Faster Movement Speed. You can't get the same upgrade a second time. Again, life is more important.\n\nAlso, after killing a boss things gets harder. The enemies drop a fire on the flooe after been killed for some time (left boss), the enemies shoots 4 shots (in a X format) after been killed (middle boss) and sentinel(?) enemies on the last boss will wake on the corridors (right boss).\n\nRecommended Boss order: middle, right, left\nI beat the left last because I just hate the fire on the floor on the other phases. I always accidentaly hit them. I think the hit box of the fire is too big, maybe it should be smaller.\nThe middle boss is the hardest, too many projectiles to avoid, so I beat it first. The X helps sometimes because it can trigger the bombs and them kill more enemies.\nThis leaves the right boss as the second boss. This boss is ok.\n\nLast boss is ok, just kill some enemies to get the rewards and life regen.\n\nAs an early access game the gameplay is great.","April 9","true","5.5"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Well, what do you expect when you are an office worker?  Hold on, I have really been abducted! AHHHHHH!\n\nSatellite Rush is a top down shooter action game where you take control of an office worker who finds himself in an interesting situation, to say the least. You will have to fight to survive and clear the Arena (corridor) of the Satellite Moebius one by one, by killing Aliens and destroying several robots along the way. You will also have to entertain an unconventional and tough audience (full of Aliens, of course), by eliminating all enemies as fast as possible or by creating a chain reaction with explosive barrels within each arena. Then they will cheer you up and even throw you some fabulous goodies for your effort; these items will help you to reach the last arena and hopefully beat the boss of the level.   Each time you eliminate an opponent, a coin will appear at the spot where your enemy has fallen. Make sure to pick up all coins before exiting an arena. Each time you reach a specific number of coins you will be able to use a new weapon from the audience.\n\nI really like the introduction cut-scenes when you load the game – they’re funny! You will be able to test your skills in three different arenas with each one slightly more challenging than the last. The level randomisation aspect will give you good re-playability but keep in mind this game is still on early access and shows great potential.\n\nGood pixel artwork, nice soundtrack (especially the samba track), you will smile all the way to the slaughtering arena!\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Good pixel artwork\n-	Level randomisation\n-	Good soundtrack\n-	Fun and addictive\n-	Achievement and Trading cards\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	Needs to be more challenging\n\nWho told you being an office worker is a boring job?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/429350/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nKumeric Labs is an independent development studio from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Their studio is one that was founded out of a number of friendships who had a shared passion of gaming. The studio was established back in 2012 with five fresh university graduates. Less than twelve months later the quintet decided to turn their passion into a reality by deciding to create a permanent dedicated gaming studio. In the time since they have added seven more people to their team bringing it to a well rounded twelve passionate staff members. Satellite Rush is their debut title.\n\nIt is a top-down shooter that features pixel art graphics, randomized levels and roguelike elements. The team have endeavored to mesh a number of well known games and media into one singular title with influences taken from Super Smash TV, Binding of Isaac and Douglas Adams with a garnish of sci-fi imaginarium. The player gets to take control of an abducted office worker and play through Satellite Moebius which is an intergalactic space arena where he must destroy enemy aliens and robots that have been programmed to kill you in order to cheer up the television show’s audience.\n\nI’ve found the game to this end to be a highly enjoyable experience. If you’re good at games such as the aforementioned The Binding of Isaac you’ll find yourself at home almost immediately. The game play can be fast and frantic which keeps you on your toes constantly. Players determine which of three doors – red, green and blue – they wish to go through and complete each room in the corridor chain before returning to tackle the next chosen door. You need to clear each arena before you can take on the next challenge but in order to do that you are aided by the dropping of various power ups and tools when you kill certain enemies. One of the smaller problems that I had with this system was that rather than having a certain time to use these power ups you’ll lose their ability when you move into the next room. I’d like to see the abilities featured on a clear timer rather than losing them because many of the power up weapons will unlock when you’ve just cleared a room making many drops almost entirely pointless.\n\nThe graphics, sound and atmosphere are almost perfect for the game in its present state. There have been some very wise game design decisions implemented into the game already. The game is colorful and vibrant without being overly so. The level design has been carefully thought out and meshes quite well with the atmosphere. One of my favorite aspects of the game is the sheer amount of enemy types. They help present new challenges in each randomized room making no two rooms let alone full games ever truly alike. Thus far I haven’t particularly noticed any of the typical downsides that this can often lead to such as games or rooms feeling unfair.\n\nAt $4.99 Satellite Rush is exceptionally well priced for the quality of its content having successfully passed from Steam Greenlight into Early Access. The game has a lot of potential and room for growth, even being as solid as it is already, and a game that I am eager to keep up to date on.\n\nFor more reviews and our popular giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com.","May 2","true","3.3"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

After playing this game, you'll probably think "well, I'd rather live my boring life than venture myself through that hell".\n\nYou play as an overweight guy who used to live a boring life until he's got abducted by some aliens. You wake up in a room, they apologize for the inconvenience and tell you that you can go back to your old life by getting yourself to the end of the corridor of Moebius, the spaceship. Well, unfortunately, this won't be easy. With an energy pistol in hands, you gotta pass through corridors full of creatures that will try to kill you. Actually, they ARE going to kill you. A LOT OF TIMES. Well, until you get the hang of it and master the controls and which weapon is the best for each situation and for each enemy. Oh, and there's the crowd! You can make it less hard by entertaining them to get items and weapons! Sweet, huh?\n\nSo go ahead and play this game. It has a lot of potential and even in early access it's pretty fun and challenging already.","April 12","true","0.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"
