But the turning radius of the trucks is poor, and not much different than older games. But the graphics are much better, as well as the weather. But this game is a different type. It is not a serious simulator, it is an arcade-style game. But there is nothing wrong with that, except for the fact that the player can get tired of it quickly, with only three environments included. I do suggest that people buy Extreme Trucker 2, but this is not a bad game, but one that has room for a LOT of improvement.","August 24, 2014","true","6.7"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","95","18","19","7","0"

It still is fun to drive a big truck. Its alot of fun to play when you have time to burn and want to know what it feels like to be a real trucker.

The controls  are well crafted I think. The truck responds   and it's pretty immersive the way the perspective works out when you're driving. You do jobs and missions to collect points and some missions have harder vehicles or environments to drive in than others. Who would have thought doing such normal, everyday driving activities could be so engaging? I like the graphics and ingame sounds which continue the whole immersion feel. However I am sad I can't get the game music at the title screen to play. I would totally play this game for that alone.\n\nPros and Cons\nPros\n\nDriving!\nRealistic controls\nGood sounds/music\n\nCons\nThere is no music in your truck :(\nNo GPS (need to press esc, and press map)\n\nTL;DR\n\nOverall Verdict\nThis is my first truck simulator, so my recommendation is not based on experience with this game type. Otherwise from my POV as a first time try-out, it seems good so I would recommend it from a pure game POV, maybe not for the price it goes for, though.\n\nIf you like more of these review stay tuned for\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/jigglesandgiggles","November 14, 2015","true","11.4"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

This game is actually pretty awesome. Gameplay is fun, and much like that of an arcade game. Players take on the role of a truck driver, and you choose different missions to gain points to unlock other levels. Players generally get 2-3+ choices each level of what difficulty they would like their haul to be, the more difficult, the bigger the reward. Difficulty is determined by a few factors, mostly on trailer/cargo size, weather, time of day and other special conditions.","March 17, 2011","true","3.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Also, I do not normally play driving games (racing or otherwise) and have not played Euro Truck Simulator 2 (newer by the same developer).\n\nI only played this game for an hour on easy and did not advance out of Canada. I did, however, complete 4 hauls.\n\nPros:\n- Graphics were good enough for this game for being 5 years old.\n- Decent AI who would me and the fissures.\n- Good handling of the transitioning traction from snow to ice or ice to snow.\n- Simpler gameplay to 18 Wheels of Steel: American Long Haul.\n\nCons:\n- No tutorial (why do I need to slow down on ice).\n- Limited replayability.\n\nI enjoyed this in a "drive a big rig like a Ferrari" kind of way. This felt very arcadeish compared to the aforementioned predacessor to this game. Because I didn't fear falling through the ice, I enjoyed drifting my trailer around corners. I did enjoy the traction change from ice to snow or snow to ice, definitely can tell the difference between the two in the handling of the truck.\n\ntl;dr: In summary, I would recommend this to someone who is a fan of the genre, otherwise I wouldn't. 3/10","July 1, 2014","true","1.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BarnaclePotato/recommended/33730/","BarnaclePotato","Barnacle Potato","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BarnaclePotato/","145 products in account","This game is very repetitive, don't get me wrong I think it is an awesome game especially when I’m at college and have to play in offline mode which limits the amount of games I can play, but it is very repetitive. By repetitive I mean that there are 3 maps and I thought there was only 1 map as it wasn't easy to find how to change between maps. The 3 maps are very straight forward literally! Because the maps are very long and that's it, there isn't many roads on each of them, they have a few turns hear and there but it is 1-2 main roads and a couple more smaller roads. Another negative about the game is how unrealistic the game is yet again don't get me wrong, the graphics aren't bad but the AI are awful, I will be driving and a truck will flip up into the air or a car will just suddenly roll over or disappear. Also on the Australia map there are fire engines that drive around, just fire engines no other emergency service and the problem is they do nothing, they aren't going anywhere which is something I can deal with but they are a normal vehicle, there state is as a normal vehicle; same speed, doesn't overtake. Last negative point I would like to mention is the trailer, the trailer in itself isn't registered as an obstructive object as cars and trucks will just drive into it, this can be easily tested by parking your trailer in the middle of the road and detaching it (Press 'T') so you can see the crash. I can be driving slow and a car will ram up behind me which loses me points and I like to maintain a 100% delivery rate (I'm sad like that).\nOkay now for the positives, the graphics to me are spot on, and the extras like indicators, window wipers and hazard lights are all there which is something I love. The road trains are the best things ever to drive because to me the longer the vehicle, the better. The physics feel good as well.\n\nOverall I don't recommend this game, Euro Truck Simulator 2 is the way to go if you are after a trucking game, the maps are bigger and everything is much more realistic.\n","April 9, 2014","false","17.0"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

I find something postive in almost every game. Almost^^\n\nOh wow am I happy this game didn't cost me a single coin.\nI mean.. no tutorial whatsoever, no goal, no motivation.. every second of driving in any other non-driving-simulating-game brings more pleasure than this.\n\nAlso, couldn't get this tanker to explode. 0/10","February 10","false","0.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Also you have no freedom what so ever you can only pick missons from a very small list of jobs, and then it gets soo boaring soo fast and it's only a short distance and there is bearly and traffic.\n\nAlso there is no reward what so ever just gain xp in the trucking carrier which opens more trucks and maybe same misson can't even buy a truck and customize it like you could in "18 weels steel convoy" If you buy this game you will be a major wast of money.","July 8, 2012","false","5.5"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","1","5","0","0"

It's not a great game, in fact you do a lot of the same thing over and over again, but it's a great time waster for when you are listening to other stuff.  Not to mention you really do have to focus to win.  It's really a quiet experience, like standing outside in the snow.  Just you and your route.","December 27, 2011","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However for me this was boring, I try to play 10 minutes of every game I try and I could only made it to 8. If you want to do crazy stuff for a little bit with a semi, play this game and do crazy stuff with a semi. If you want to drive along a predetermined route in a semi with no reward whatsoever for doing so in a plain setting that isn't the best quality, play this game. If you want to have fun driving a semi and feel like there's point to doing it, like getting new trucks or making money you can spend to get a better truck or having cool places to go or cool things to deliver or even just getting to choose the colors of your semi, don't play this game. I'd also not suggest paying $10 to do the things I said you can get from this game if you do want those things.","November 11, 2015","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not bad as far as enviroments and driving but it does feel bland compared to the Euro Truck series though. I will recommend it since its not terrible and glitchy like so many other discount simulators but I'd only chose this over Euro Truck if i couldnt run it but a decent game none the less.","January 12","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
