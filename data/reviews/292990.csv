It seems to me they are testing out the fan base and what the demand will be for multi-language. If that's the case, then we might be seeing an English Language support update sometime soon. We also might be seeing many more games of the genre as well later on if the game proves successful cross region. I would love to see Romance of the Three Kingdoms brought out as well. :)\n\nIn the state this game is in right now, I will say hold on to your money and wait for an English update. But, if you know the language, you will have a head start at enjoying this awesome game. :D\nFor now, keep it in the wishlist and follow the community group page for this game to get notified if an English language support update becomes available.\n\nAbout the game though, I noticed it is more strategy based than the previous NA games and focuses a lot on diplomacy. But what I really like is that now you are able to create the Era, Nobunaga originally intended on for a united land. That's awesome. :)","August 27, 2014","true","14.8"," 317 of 349 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","317","349","0","40"

I've played and loved this series for years.  I was super excited to see this on Steam because I can easily buy the game and support the developers versus getting it via other means.\n\nHOWEVER, do not buy this buggy ♥♥♥ game.  They're simply not putting as much effort into fixing simple but glaring bugs as they are putting out costly DLCs.  An example of this simple bug is the ability to type and customize your officers (a feature that has been around in all prior iteration of this franchise).  Everytime I try to create a character using chinese characters, the entire game just crashes.  And it's not just one or two words, its on a LOT of characters.\n\nThe sad part is, the bug is known and brought up many times on the Steam forums (posts are in Chinese and English) back in August.  It still has not been addressed, 6 months later.\n\nI recommend sticking with alternate ways of "supporting" the incompetents running this ♥♥♥♥ show.","March 21, 2015","false","9.4"," 37 of 67 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","37","67","0","0"

(信長之野望·創造 with 威力加強版 v1.0.0.0)\n\nI've been a fan of Nobunaga's Ambition ever since I came across Nobu4 (武将風雲録) on PC, and Souzou is probably my favorite of them all.  KOEI has taken many of the good ideas from previous installments of this franchise and integrated them in one cohesive gaming experience.\n\nI very much appreciate the flexibility that the game provides in city development and battle management - you can control them either at the macro level or at the micro level, and both mechanisms work well enough such that I am comfortable choosing between micro vs. macro without worrying about having sub-optimal results.  (Personally, I have gotten very lazy nowadays, and I almost never zoom into battles for micro management.  This is a time saver once my army is sufficiently larger than the nearby NPCs.)\n\nAlso, once you own the captial city plus enough number of regions, you can activate the command "總無事令" and finish the game immediately.  It's a convenient way to end the game once your faction becomes so strong to the point that battles are boring and easy.\n\nThe system for "character growth" in Souzou is also more reasonable than that in previous installments, in that it gives importance to "work experience" for every character, without taking away the "edge" of the elite characters.  The list of "character abilities" is well chosen by the developers, such that the unique strengths (and sometimes weaknesses) of the famous and infamous historical figures can be lived out in the game.\n\nI am also very impressed by all the upgrade options for castles, and the feature of building new castles is also very well thought-out.  The whole system of roads, castles, and castle upgrades demonstrates a great deal of attention to details, and it succeeds in providing a deep and engaging gameplay.\n\nI have been running 信長之野望·創造 with 威力加強版 v1.0.0.0, and I have not encountered any crashes.  The only "glitch" that I came across is that 竹中半兵衛 never appeared in my game.  (My scenario is the one that starts in April 1551).\n\nOverall, I am extremely satisfied with this game, and I hope KOEI will continue to make great games like this!","November 1, 2015","true","81.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","3","4","2","0"

You've a stupid amount of castles and mini castles that you got to build up infrastructure in roughly 4 levels (land, structure, expand land, and roads).  Unlike the previous NAs where you either have your infrastructure doomsday team finish everything in 2 months, or you have your faceless guys queue up 3 years worth of infrastructure projects and then check back in 3 years, here you're supposed to constantly check what all your 20 to 200 places are building each month.  Don't worry because you can delegate it all and that's what you should do for your sanity, and like the previous NAs you'll have resources you can't possibly spend after about a year or two worth of game time anyway.\n\nIn an attempt to curb down the previous game's ridiculous million versus million army matches, Souzou made it awfully hard to amass your army with both in game restrictions and a rather unwieldy interface to move troops around.  Besides, by the time you actually have troops that you can call up from reserves, you're already well on your way to winning the game so it's not worth the time to navigate the interface to move your troops when you can just delegate for a few more months and have AI kill everything for you.  It'd be far faster in real life time to ignore your massive army in a safe location and just build a new one from a scratch.  Due to the game's rather cryptic rules on how many units can stack when you're doing siege, you're probably better off just moving your leader to a corner of the map and delegate everything else to AI who at least will never run into a situation where you can't even move your army due to stacking rules since the AI knows all the stacking rules way better than you.\n\nAs is in this game about all you have to do is build the first few structure that might actually matter (like stuff that increases your troop's power) and plot out the first couple of fights where you're not strong enough to steamroll everything, and after that you should just stop playing the game and let the computer play for you.  Yes the previous series have this problem too, but at least before your key units feel powerful so it was okay to play only one city with 3 or so major units while the computer supplements you with hundreds of your units, because the powerful units can wipe out entire armies by themselves.  While the strongest generals are still strong, their effect is not nearly as pronounced and if you've any interest in finishing this game in a reasonable time, you'd be much better off taking Nobunaga or Shingen or Kenshin to a backwater corner of Japan to work on farming so that you can have as few city under your direct control as possible so that the computer can do all the ridiculous amount of micro management needed in blazing speed.  Sure, you can do better than the AI if you take the time to figure this out, but it'd take literally 10 times longer for you to execute these commands as opposed to the 'delegate everything to computer' command, and they can still win just fine once you setup the right foundation for them.\n\nGiven the dearth of good strategy games in Steam, I guess it's still worth buying compared to other options that are available (provided you can read Chinese), but compared to the other games of the same series or Romance of the Three Kingdom, I can't recommend this game if you're able to get any of the earlier NA or ROTK games instead.","September 15, 2014","false","3.6"," 22 of 52 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","22","52","0","0"
