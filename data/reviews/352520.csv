There isn’t anything about this game that is groundbreaking or excessively impressive, but it still comes together to make for an enjoyable experience.  If you are a fan of point-and-click adventure games, you should probably check this out.\n\nThe narrative of the game is probably its best quality.  The story is rather cliché, revolving around time-travel and prevention of the apocalypse.  But the way in which the story unfolds is intriguing, and I found myself enjoying the tale even though it was far from novel.  Moreover, the pacing of the story was perfect, with plot developments timed at just the right moments to keep me interested.\n\nThe puzzles are inventory-based, and are all very logical and intuitive.  There won’t be any points in the game where you will find yourself saying: “that solution makes no sense.”  That may not seem like something worth mentioning, but, unfortunately, many point-and-click games have puzzle solutions that don’t make much sense.  Luckily, in The Silent Age, all of the puzzle solutions are reasonable.   Due to this, and the fact that there aren’t many inventory items to be found, the game inevitably is quite simple.  The time-travel dynamic, while not groundbreaking, does spice up some of the puzzle-solving and undoubtedly makes the game more interesting.\n\nThe Silent Age boils down to a story-driven, casual experience that is great for times you may want to play something that is low-pressure and that you can’t really mess up.  There is even a well-crafted level select system so you don’t even have to worry about missable achievements.  I would recommend it to big fans of point-and-click adventure games.  It is rather short and simple, however, and anyone on the fence regarding the genre may find it somewhat lacking.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","September 6, 2015","true","3.9"," 127 of 134 people (95%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","95","127","134","4","3"

In my opinion, the story isn't anything amazing and is quite linear, but it can hold your attention and is integrated well with the nature of the game. Controls consist of clicking left or right to move the character and on objects to interact. The puzzles involve switching between different time periods and are fairly simple so they don't interfere much with the pace of the story.\n\nThe presentation is clean and simple. The soundtrack is great at creating a sense of suspense throughout the game, but the voice acting can be hit or miss for some. Also, most of the time I spent in the game was looking at descriptions which loaded up fairly slowly. If they were to load as fast as the time switching, a sizeable amount of play time could be chopped off.\n\nYou'll likely obtain most of the achievements by the time you complete the game as they are fairly easy to get. Since the game is organized into chapters, you can easily hop back to a section to pick up what you missed.\n\nI can't say much about how it compares to the mobile version as I've never played it, but the game runs smoothly for me and I have not encountered any bugs.\n\nOverall, it was an enjoyable experience. I would say the game is one of the better point-and-click games available on Steam. It's worth a try if you have it. If you are interested and don't have it, wait until a sale to pick it up.","June 3, 2015","true","5.4"," 40 of 40 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","40","40","2","4"

It would seem fate had different plans for him. The Silent Age is classic science fiction mixed with fantastic puzzle solving. Using a portable time machine you will bounce through realities trying to find out whats going on and how you are connected to it all. The art direction is a clash of post apocalyptic and groovy 70's design. From over the top wallpapers to overgrown flora and dilapidated buildings. While The Silent Age isn't the most complicated game in the world, the elements it does bring are done well, from the music, UI, and even controller support. For me this game was comfort food and was familiar. The puzzles were challenging enough but didn't grind progression to a halt. As far as it being a port goes, the graphics have been overhauled and look great, and voice work where present is well done and I was happy to hear it. The only complaint I could muster is that the game a little bit on the short side, probably taking 2 to 4 hours at the most to complete. That isn't totally a bad thing but I guess I just wanted more.\n\nI made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\nhttps://youtu.be/LS8g--4QNpE\nI hope you enjoy!\nMartyr","August 13, 2015","true","4.1"," 38 of 41 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","38","41","0","0"

The Silent Age tooked me about 3 hours, but it was deep story. Sound, graphics and story are greate. I dont wanna give you spoilers, but the game is about time traveling. The game is not difficult, its more like interactive movie mixed with adventure game . I beated the game in two sittings, but it wasnt boring at all.

It's one of those few that are amazing. So the game was originally released for iOS in 2012 and this was the first episode, the next one drop in 2014. After this, both episodes were merge together and released as a standalone game for PC. The story is about time travelling, but it's not so complicated and gets you in really quick. Some ideas may feel a little surreal but this is what makes The Silent Age so cool. Awesome graphic style and nice voice acting get you involve in no time. The story is about 3 hours long.

The protagonist can only walk left and right, never turns around, doors just fade out of existence, flashbacks are told in still images ... not exactly horrible, but it could have been better. At least the voice acting is good. And the story, while not particularly creative, is also fine. Could have used a different ending, though.\n\nFor a game originally released on mobiles, the gameplay works quite well. It's simple and easy, sure, but that's still better than it being difficult or wonky. To solve puzzles, you have to jump between the present and the future. All you need is to click on the time machine and there you go. A swift transition without unnecessary effects.\n\nBut the speed is hampered by descriptions that take literally forever to appear. It's like they're trying to prolong an otherwise short experience. 2 or 3 hours and that's it. Might be too short for a couple of people, but it never seemed rushed or anything.\n\nSo should you buy The Silent Age? Maybe. It's not amazing, but it also isn't bad.","May 29, 2015","true","2.9"," 35 of 43 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","35","43","0","1"

To be honest I don't understand why they didn't reply to us, or featured it as news, even though their patch caused the whole issue, they fixed it nicely really fast - good support is a valuable thing.\n\nThings that may deter you from purchasing, depending on your preferations:\n- Game has 10 chapters, each around half an hour if you play for the first time, maybe somewhat more. This is considered to be a short point and click, and it's easy as well - if you want a more challenging, or longer game, you should stay away.\n- The game features time travel, so it does what every story, movie, book every that features timetravel heavily: messes it up.  Any change you make in the past is really focused on the future, always calculable - the hole won't get fixed, buried, covered etc, and never will have extra consequences. So if you're going for a very logical, almost realistic story, this game isn't really your thing.\nIf you're okay with these, feel free to get the game! Not the longest, not the most realistic/serious ones, but it's quite likeable, perfect for players who want a point and click with more emphasis on story, and won't get you stuck for hours with a puzzle - the protagonist isn't the sharpest tool in the shed and pretty clueless in some situations, so prepare for some funny descriptions about items or actions!","February 7","true","8.5"," 24 of 25 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","24","25","0","0"

I think the art style is wonderful and I really like point and click games where your character tells you how stupid you are for trying to set everything on fire. You even get achievements for trying things out, which is something way more point and click games should do!\n\nThe story is alright. It's hard to make a decent about time travel, without creating insultingly obvious plotholes, and they definitely did their best. Just sometimes it feels like they were way too focused on keeping the storyline as clean as possible that the writing suffers a little bit and the dialogues become a bit predictable and boring.\n\nI personally couldn't find myself identifying or caring for any of the characters or the world they lived in, and that just made the game a bit of a drag after the first chapters. They just felt so empty with most of their dialogue being exposition about the plot. Maybe it's also a bit of a problem with the voice actors?","January 2","false","3.7"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","17","22","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlamesSuperior/recommended/352520/","FlamesSuperior","UpInFlames","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlamesSuperior/","263 products in account","There are theories that suggest that time travel is indeed possible. They are only theories and there are still many open questions regarding what exactly would happen if certain time travel scenarios were realized such as the grandfather paradox. It is precisely those mysteries and unknowns that make time travel so fascinating. It’s great to know the answers, but it also makes things less exciting. That’s just human nature. And that’s why the premise of The Silent Age is so interesting, especially since it explores time travel both in its narrative and gameplay.\n\nThe Silent Age is a point-and-click adventure game set in 1972 in which you play as Joe, a janitor who works for a huge corporation called Archon. Through an unfortunate series of events, Joe gets his hands on a handheld time travel device which he can use to travel 40 years into the future. Joe quickly realizes not all is well in 2012. In fact, something has gone horribly wrong and mankind has suffered through a global extinction event. It’s up to Joe to piece things together and try to find out what exactly happened. The story is interesting from the outset and the writing is very good. It is obviously very much influenced by Twelve Monkeys. As is the case in all adventure games, Joe will offer his insight when clicking on different objects, but what I found to be a really nice touch were the unique lines of dialogue when you try to combine objects incorrectly. When you try to bring a torch to an oil barrel, Joe won’t just use a generic reply such as “No, this won’t work”, he will refer to the insanity of lighting a barrel of oil on fire.\n\nI found the puzzle design to be a real treat. Some hardcore adventure fans might find the puzzles too easy, and they are definitely not as hard as in most adventure games we remember from the 80’s and 90’s, but I don’t necessarily see that as a negative. It’s the design that matters, not the difficulty. There’s no value in illogical puzzles that require you to get into the mind of the developer in order to solve them. The Silent Age’s puzzles shine because they are logical and make perfect sense. They also keep the pace flowing, you don’t want your players stuck on a puzzle for hours on end. It hurts the pace of the story and frustrates players. The best puzzles in the game require you to jump back and forth from 1972 and 2012. For example, when Joe needed an apple, he gathered some soil and seeds and placed them under a water source in 1972. When he shifted to 2012, he found an apple tree and literally picked the fruits of his labor.\n\nThe game employs a fantastic art style that is both visually striking and also supports the design brilliantly as it pretty much alleviates any pixel hunting. The sound design also has to be commended for its dark ambient soundtrack and solid sound effects. The voice acting is mostly good apart from a terrible voice over of a secretary at the very beginning of the game. The game isn’t particularly long, it took me about 4 hours to get through it and I thought it was the perfect length as neither the story or the gameplay outstayed their welcome.\n\nThe Silent Age is a great adventure game with engaging, expertly designed puzzles, compelling narrative and fantastic presentation. This kind of focus isn’t seen too often in this genre, the developer obviously had a very clear vision and managed to realize it successfully. Amanita Design became my favorite adventure game developer in recent years thanks to this type of attention to detail and the synergy between puzzle design and art. If House on Fire continues in this direction we’ll have another fantastic modern adventure game developer on our hands.\n\n8 OUT OF 10 (GREAT)","June 6, 2015","true","4.5"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

You play a not-so-bright janitor suddenly tasked with saving mankind. To do this, you have to travel back and forth in time, overcoming obstacles along the way. Your time travels take you to a post-apocalyptic future that is both haunting and surreal.\n\nLikes- Nice graphics\n- Interesting, engaging story\n- Simple, no-frills interface\n- Great ambience (sound + art convey very convincing environments)\n- Individual chapters are replayable (handy for getting achievements)\n- Unique puzzle-solving method (i.e. using the time travel concept)\n- Has a proper ending\n\nDislikes- Game starts saying "use earphones" without explaining why (I used normal speakers btw and it sounded ok)\n- On item descriptions, there is no way to click text away, so you have to wait till it disappears on its own before you can see the next round of text. This was stupendously time-wasting and incredibly irritating. And you also would not know if there was a 2nd/3rd round of text coming; you just had to wait. (Because if you clicked on something else, you might accidentally click away next round of text, if there was any.)\n- Subpar language use in parts of the game\n- Boring conclusion\n\nVerdictA lot of gameplay time is wasted walking/running (you can run by double-clicking) back & forth to various locations, and waiting for the next round of item description text to appear, since there's no way you can click to make the text disappear (see "dislikes" above). This caused much irritation. But the game's story, coupled with the brilliant execution of superimposing the future world with that of the current one, makes up for everything. The chilling, highly immersive visualisation of the post-apocalyptic world is also extremely well done.","May 6","true","9.7"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","2"

It is a PC port of a mobile game, but it doesn't feel like it is.\n\nThe Pros:Interesting Story - Without spoiling anything, the story is about a Randy Marsh lookalike named Joe and he is your average janitor at a shady homeland security company. A series of events puts him in the place of being able to jump through time and... saaave da wuuurld!. Even if the story is a little far fetched, it is nicely presented to the player and has a certain depth and complexity to it. However, I don't get the ending. It's a paradox of casuality.\n\nChapter Select - There are 10 chapters to play, and you can choose to replay any unlocked chapter at any given time. Excellent if you have a favorite level or missed an achievement or want to do a speed run.\n\nNice Graphics and Sound - The graphics aren't detailed, and they resemble something you would find in a Flash game, but they do look nice and I love the overall look of the game. Sound quality is also good, even if Joe's voice actor plays it a little too worried and confused.\n\nAutomatic Item Discard - The games makes it easy for you by removing items once their use has been fulfilled instead of cluttering your inventory. Also, has quite the humor when you try out insanely stupid interaction possibilities.\n\nAchievements - The achievements are both easy to make, and are mainly concerned on the story line. If you are creative and figure out the clues in the name, you will be able to get all 24 achievements in a single run. This is an enjoyable "Perfect Game" for the achievement hunters.\nThe Cons:Linear - The puzzles are too linear to pose a real challenge and it could have been much more complicated than simply two time instances. Often, you get the solution because there aren't really that many things to interact with, as you only access the required items in the order they need to be used (mostly).\n\nParadoxes! - Because of the very nature of time-traveling (which is one way only -> to the future), even if said time machine worked both ways, paradoxes form galore. I won't spoil anything, but will include a spoiler tag text in the comments of this review, if interested.\n\nShort - The game takes only about 4 hours to very casually go through it, and because the levels are so easy and linear, unless you've missed an achievement, or want to pay closer attention to the story, there aren't any incentives to replay it.\nConclusionThis is a great point and click puzzled with a decent story that is sure to get your attention for a few hours. Very pleasant to the eyes, ears and brain, along with the great achievement system makes this a solid choice if you're into science fiction and puzzle games.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more of my recommended games, you can view my reviews here, and be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","August 25, 2015","true","3.2"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","14","19","0","2"

I'm a sucker for time travel in general and this is a clever, good-humoured, and captivating approach with a definitely eerie atmosphere.

I found the story unfolded a lot more than I initially expected as well, which was awesome.\n\nIf you're looking for a fairly quick game to stimulate the mystery-loving part of your brain, absolutely give The Silent Age a try.

Not especially long, it betrays its episodic lineage by having chapters, that are effectively different areas, entirely sealed off one from another, so puzzles can never span across them, and the items leading to the solutions must always be found in relative vicinity, making the process easier than most adventure games and more puzzle-y.\n\nThe game's not fully voiced, but when it is, the voicework's quality is excellent, with several familiar voices from Telltale games, including Adam "Bigby" Harrington.","February 6","true","4.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I WON THIS GAME ON STEAMGIFTS(dot)COM AND I ENJOY IT !\nFirst of all i had the opinion that all Point and click are mostly boring and just a time waste - but not Silent Age! The Silent Age is a point-and-click puzzle video game developed by Danish indie game studio House on Fire. The Silent Age is a new time-travelling episodic adventure, split between two eras.  The First eery is played in 1972 and the Second - four decades later (2012).  You play as Joe, a humble cleaner with a red boiler suit and a moustache. Joe can jump between the two time periods, which certainly comes in handy when solving the game's tricky puzzles.\n\nThe game has a well written and interesting story and some nice voice acting and the game runs smoothly without any issues yet. The Game is a must buy for everyone who likes point and click with challenging puzzles overall - especially if one want to explore every little corner and detail of the game.\n\nEdit 14th June 2015 - 12:44 AM\nI just found 1 (and a half) Con threw the whole Game:\n\n- If you aren't one of those guys who can't read that well then it's an obstacle to read the Signs on the part which isnt voiced over.

I more or less quit adventure games long time ago, because I didn't like that the only way forward seemed to be either bruteforcing your way through, or giving up and consulting a walkthrough. Not to mention ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t pixel hunting. The Silent Age has none of that.\n\n\n- The game is quite short, it took me something between 3 and 4 hours to finish. I liked that, it didn't overstay its welcome.\n- All the puzzles make sense and you won't get stuck for too long at any point of the game. Even small items have a generous space for you to mouseover/click.\n- The story deals with time travel, and while it doesn't tell anything 'new', I found it interesting and was always looking forward to fínding out more about it.\n- For most of the game you've got access to a time travel machine, which makes you jump from the 'present' to the 'future', and you use this to solve the puzzles. The time travel is fast, so it doesn't get frustrating to have to swap between the timelines several times to reach the place you're going to. I kept looking forward to reaching another room to see how it changes between present and future.\n- The game is split into 11 self-contained chapters, so there's no long backtracking as you always have just a small number of rooms/screens.\n- Graphics and animations are simple, yet good looking.\n- Only dialogues are voiced, apart from some grunts and exclamations. The voice acting is okay.\n\n\nAll in all, my re-introduction to point & click adventures started well.\n\n- 2.5 golden sloths.","September 21, 2015","true","3.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Having just finished this time-travel game in 3 hours, I was truly blown away by the 1) engaging storytelling and 2) quality atmosphere set by a beautiful limited-color graphics palette and moody ambient sounds. The puzzles themselves were decent, and I loved how Joe, the likeable janitor protagonist, would interact with his present environment, in order to alter its future equivalent so that he could find solutions to puzzles.\n\nThat said, while the puzzles were good, it’s the actual eerie “mood” of the game that was done extremely well and left a lasting impression on me.  It’s unfortunate that there’s only limited voice acting (mostly during cutscenes and a few random comments from Joe here and there) as I feel that comprehensive voice acting could have strengthened the atmosphere of the game even more, and fleshed out Joe’s personality.\n\nEven though Joe killed a cute innocent little fish </3, I wholeheartedly recommend this atmospheric and eerie adventure game. My only gripe is that it’s a little pricy ($10 for a short ~3 hours of gameplay), so perhaps get it on sale unless you’re REALLY REALLY into point and click adventure games.","January 10","true","3.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's an inventory-based point & click adventure and a great one at that!\n\nThe story is really captivating – up to the point where it's actually really hard *not* to finish the game in one sitting. It has 10 short chapters which are all exciting and convey a great mood. I've completed the whole thing in about 4 hours, with 6 achievements still missing. The visual style reminiscent of web-based Flash games might look bad at first glance – however it's not detrimental to the atmosphere at all! On the contrary: it feels like some sort of 70's art style which fits perfectly to our protagonist.\n\nWhat's especially brilliant is the time travelling. Changing between two time periods, the game creates some exciting puzzles and solutions to them. Another thing that's a *HUGE* plus is the ingenious soundtrack, which sometimes reminded me of Vangelis' soundtrack for "Blade Runner".\n\nI bought this game while it was on sale, but I'd even recommend it at full price.\nGo for it, adventure fans!

Joe is your average, shy, middle-aged white American in the early 1970s. Joe works as a janitor for a stereotypical US firm so low in the company food chain that even his boss doesn’t know his name.\n\nJoe is also involved in a time travel experiment that is about the wipe the human race from the face of the Earth within a day.\n\nThis may sound far-fetched, but the premise is handled with a very down-to-earth mentality, which is also reflected in the clean, straightforward plotting and the similarly simple, sharp visual style.\n\nSilent Age is not a classic style point ‘n’ click but one that is a lot closer to a smartphone title. Therefore, it is more of a puzzle game with a plot, since it is divided to ten self-contained chapters, where your goal is to explore the available 2-4 locations and find the correct items and hotspots to progress.\nThis segmentation carries the drawback of using dialogues somewhat in a plot dump manner, but not in an obnoxious way. The larger problem may be the length: since all chapters are short, the entire game is barely 2 hours long in return, which may scare away people with tighter wallets.","September 24, 2015","true","2.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Besides originally being a mobile game, the only sign of it is the rather large UI, for example the inventory and the dialogue text. For the inventory system I have to give it a positive rating due to the it's simplistic nature, perfectly fitting for this genre of video games. Optimization is a factor well treated in The Silent Age, something unsual in mobile ports. There are only two differences between the PC version and the mobile version. Voice acting, which is of high quality and fitting to each character, and "Ultra HD" graphics, as stated by the developers. Controller support is a big plus.\n\nThe art design that can be seen is rather gorgeous, contrasting between the seventies, and 2012, after the apocalypse. You get to solve puzzles by switching through the past and the future! How cool is that? It reminds me of Fallout, and that's a very positive point. The soundtrack is fitting to the game's atmosphere and never disappoints. I could only ask for more voice acting, in parts where the character (Joe), simply says "Oh!", and the rest has to be read.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed this point&click title too much. I you will experience a great story, featuring an original character, that contains twists here and there. The idea is unique, for a point&click game.

As far as adventure games go, this one is not too difficult, as it relies on environmental puzzles to advance through the level. It's fairly straight-forward in terms of "ok, I found a fight extinguisher, I guess I'll need to put out a fire," and you use all the items you find before moving to the next chapter. Take that as you will, some may prefer the old fashioned Sierra logic games where you somehow have to make a rocket out of a office supplies and an oil drum to knock a book off a ledge. Others will prefer being able to figure things out without a walkthrough.\n\nIn terms of presentation and polish, this game gets a high B in overall quality. The UI is simple but functional, the art style isn't jawdropping but it still looks good, and the music is pretty good. The game runs without a hitch and offers simple controller support out of the box. I found using the controller preferable but it offers no advantage or disadvantage, it's just nice to have as an option.\n\nThe game is fairly short, so you may want to pick it up in a bundle or on sale rather than full price, but it's definitely a sold game that's worth your time.","April 17","true","2.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Visually, there isn't anything too impressive. Its more or less storyline rich. One aspect I like about it, it focuses not on anyone special, but your run of the mill janitor just trying to make a living. The overall storyline isn't about a hero, or unique super human being, but just an average man encountering abstract events in his world.\nSadly, its too short. I wish they would expand this series. I got this on sale, but for $10 (if I were to pay the full amount)  I would like more play time. I also wish they would add a feature where Joe (the main character) can have different options to answer from. The main character himself lacks a lot of character. If it wasn't for the dense storyline he would really fall into the background as a wallflower.\nThe actually humorous part is whenever you find trying different objects to interact with the scenes, to progress in the storyline, there's a line for nearly every object. For example cloth on vines (this is not verbatim) "am I supposed to rub this in pieces?"\nI am a huge supsporter of smaller games like this. I really loved this storyline, and hope they can expand this, or make similar games. Would probably nix the price a bit consdering how short the game play is.

You play as a janitor named Joe who works for a company whose purpose is, at least to the public, largely unknown. Near the beginning of the game, an incident occurs with a different janitor and Joe is suddenly promoted and given higher security clearance. During this sudden event he finds all is not well at his company.\n\nWithout giving away any specific reasons for things, Joe possesses a device that alters his surroundings by the effect of time travel. Which is deeply integrated into puzzle solving; as this is a traditional point and click adventure. The puzzles are simple and relatively strait forward. There is no pixel hunting challenges. Which is refreshing as it keeps the pace quite rapid with new information always being revealed. The game also does a decent job of gating your exploration. While it doesn't feel very open ended it makes it much easier to manage inventory items keeping you moving forward.\n\nSurprisingly, the story does not end where you it might lead you to believe early on.

Because of that, I'm very happy with what I got from the game for the price. A nice little game that will take a couple of hours to finish, and give you a decent story that you won't find much to complain about.\n\nHowever, out of interest I just came to the store page to see how much it's going for, and I see it's currently $9.99. If I paid that, my review would have a very different tone.\n\nMake no mistake, this is a nice little game, but it's not $10 worth of game. You can play free flash games about as long and difficult as this on various game sites. While enjoyable and easy on the eye, this game is very basic.\n\nBasic controls (click, click, click). Basic interaction (totally linear, you have no say in where you go or how you react). Basic visuals (it looks fine, but nothing better than "fine"). Absolutely no replayablity.\n\nThis is the kind of game you want to pick up for 99c in a summer or winter sale, or as part of a cheap bundle. An average person, and certainly a person who pinches pennies when buying games, will be underwhelmed by this game, and will likely feel a little robbed by the $10 valuation.\n\nI'm giving a "Yes" to the game based on what I got it for, but if I bought it and current value I would have to give a "No".\n\nShop wisely.","August 21, 2015","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thekeystone/recommended/352520/","thekeystone","The Keystone","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thekeystone/","437 products in account","This game is great in a lot of different ways.\n\n==\n\nThe gameplay - A point and click adventure, the controls are really well done. Your cursor being your only means of controlling, it feels really fluid and smooth. You click to inspect objects, to move Joe, and to go to other scenes. I'd say the only thing I don't really enjoy is the running controls, which is you clicking continually to make him run. However, its still a really nice point and click set up.\n\nTime travel is a big part of the gameplay, and is really well done here. You are required to switch back and forth between an inhabited environment to a post-apocolapytic environment tons during the game. This is handled very well, and makes puzzles twice as fun.\n\nOne more thing: the puzzles are challenging, but not too challenging. There were a couple of hangups for me, but a lot of it is pretty straight forward.\n\n==\n\nThe artwork - The artwork is one of the best parts of the game. Simple and smooth, it takes a 2D plane and makes it interesting and immersive. The animation also has its highlights. It feels very modern and welcoming.\n\n==\n\nThe story - This game has a complicated plot. It also has a great plot. And it definitely does not require you to be a rocket scientist to understand (while some rocket scientists do make appearances in the game). What I'm trying to say is, you can get the gist without having to understand every facet of time travel logic.\n\nThe game deals with a lot of time travel, a lot of post apolopytic logic, and a lot of backstory involving war. As the game takes place in 1972, you really get a look into the past. This also is well done.\n\n==\n\nThe characters - Everything is good about these characters. Joe, Dr. Lambert, Frank - they all have amazing voice actors, story, and dialogue.\n\nThe voice acting in this game is simply sublime. The dialogue is too. Very witting with a lot of attention to detail. Just about every objects has 2 or 3 pieces of dialogue attached to it for different situations.\n\n==\n\nThis review doesn't go into detail completely, but should inform you about the basics. Its definitely worth the money - 4 hours of solid gameplay for me - and that was just a run through.\n\nSolid fun and great casual gameplay. 10/10 for what its worth.","October 17, 2015","true","4.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/starshipwaters/recommended/352520/","starshipwaters","starshipwaters","http://steamcommunity.com/id/starshipwaters/","667 products in account","Perfect litmus test for adventure game newbies to find out if inventory-based adventure games are up their alley.\nThe Silent Age is a clean, straightforward, and succinctly written science-fiction adventure where you solve puzzles as the oafish but affable janitor Joe. In an effort to be "spoiler-free," let's just say, like many adventure game protagonists, Joe is thrust into situations and environments he is not prepared for and that require clever thinking to overcome.\n\nThe puzzles in this game largely escape absurdist Adventure Game Logic, and by doing so are very logical. In being logical, however, some puzzles are occasionally too obvious, but others alternately take a bit of outside thinking or real-world knowledge to solve. There is no need for real inventory management to combine items or anything, as you are typically only solving one or two puzzles at any given moment, and when you use an item it disappears from your inventory. Unlike other adventure games, the need for a guide here is highly unlikely and the puzzles won't leave you frustrated.\n\nMuch like its puzzles, the game's user interface is intuitive and logical. The mouse cursor controls everything, be it moving Joe around, looking, using, or picking up items. This is a good game to play with one hand and reward yourself with a tasty beverage in the other.\n\nSomething I feel that might be overlooked in the game is its intensely dry humor. Reminiscent of older adventure games, most things Joe has to say are really funny, but are not written as a 'haha' joke. They are just genuinely clever/insightful quips filtered through the lovable dolt of a protagonist.\n\nA downside to the game is it is not very long. I was able to finish it (with 100% achievements) in less than 4 hours. The game takes place over 10 "stages," and the puzzles/items are isolated stage-to-stage, so anything you pick up in a stage will be used in that stage. While I enjoyed the experience during that time, it may be worth waiting for a sale to get a better price/gameplay hours ratio if that is important to you.\n\nAll in all, I think The Silent Age is a great (but short) game that offers some interesting gameplay mechanics but also does not reinvent any wheels. I would recommend this to newbie adventure game players and fans of the genre who would like a light adventure, but hardcore fans of the genre may find it too basic.","October 8, 2015","true","3.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a fun game if you're into the genre, but nothing fantastic. The story is ultimately disappointing, and there's a ton of annoying back-and-forth to complete simple tasks. If you're not into point-and-click adventures, I can't imagine this being the game to change you mind. Even if you are into them, I'd recommend waiting for a sale, due to it being very short (I took my time and had to replay several segments to get all the achievements, and it still took less than 3 1/2 hours). And with no decisions to make, or different endings, there's no compelling reason to finish the game more than once.\nTL;DR: Fun for genre fans, but short and ultimately forgettable.","August 28, 2015","true","3.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So you get to see a before and after of the different rooms and spaces. An interesting concept!\nWhen I started there was something buggy with the cursor, but this was quickly resolved. Not sure how I resolved it... maybe it was just messing with the settings or reloading the game... But I haven't had any problems since.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharuun/recommended/352520/","sharuun","No More Please","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharuun/","205 products in account","I was expecting something so different than this... Really, I was. I got what I thought I was going to get, but I feel very deprived.\n\n*SPOILERS- For just this paragraph*\nThe Silent Age follows the character Joe as he finds out in 1972 that his company is doing something that might mean a little more than he though... but, god! I really thought this story was going to be so good! And all the questions I had had  really simple answers. What kills everyone in 2012? The flu. Who are those guys in the chambers? Other time travellers (not even clones!)? Who is Frank? A Soviet... secret agent... Right.\n\nSee the story is what I had my biggest problems with, if you couldn't tell. I thought it would be so complex and there'd be a massive plot twist at the end, but this particular time travel story is played very safe. Pretty much every convention you know from your traditional time travel stories is in here. Dystopian future, limited time to save the world, yada yada yada. But I wouldn't have as many problems if the story itself wasn't so dull. Joe has no personality. The doctor is a unique character, but he's given such little time that we don't know who he is. And the big twist with Frank is kind of out of nowhere, since we met him 5 mintues before he revealed himself (Oh, and the post-it note at the beginning. Forgot about that.).\n\nThe world itself is also very boring. Don't get me wrong, the graphics are GORGEOUS in this game. Silent Age has a very unique look that really stands out when compared to other video games' artistic styles. And I really like how this game looks. But the world itself is just... boring. Archon is a serious business with a boss who doesn't care about his employees that has some dark secrets. Yawn. And outside of that, there's very little to the actual world. Just a bunch of linked events to lead you to the climax.\n\nHowever, there are a few things I REALLY liked in this game. For one, the music and ambience is top notch. It really establishes a sense of tension, and the things going on inside the levels you traverse feel like real locations. I'd say the worst sound aspect is the voice acting. It's all over the place. You've got some good lines here and there, but there are some really awkwardly written and delivered lines where all you can do is raise an eyebrow and ask, "The hell...?"\n\nOn top of that, I enjoyed the time travel mechanics used in puzzle-solving. It's very unique to see a homeless man playing guitar in 1970, and later see his charred corpse on the ground in 2012. Plus, using this mechanic makes puzzles a lot more unique. Some doors might be locked in 1970 that are unlocked in 2012. There might be a wrench in 2012 that'll screw the bolts of a hatch in 1970. And the puzzles are decently laid out, so you can intuitively solve them by yourself. It's a point-and-click puzzle that isn't too complex or too simple. It's just right.\n\nUnfortunately, this is dragged down by some of the dull elements in the actual story. I don't care about Joe. The world he lives in is just... uninteresting. And the story encompassing everything going on is surprisngly bland. I was hoping it'd lead to so much more (the tension really made me think there'd be a twist where Joe's past clones of himself were all trying to solve the same problem and kept getting stuck where he did towards the end. Now THAT would be cool! Or maybe he finds out that Archon was actually trying to solve the problem that he was unknowingly creating over and over again. Now, wouldn't that be a neat twist? But, if you like a well-done point-and-click with amazing graphics and sound design, but an unfortunately forgettable story... hey! This game's alright.","February 9","false","3.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The story is interesting, but it is told pretty much only through three or so extended monologues that punctuate Joe's bewildered stumbling through life. There was little to endear the main character to me. He really is just stumbling through an, admittedly, confounding situation, picking up objects that let him move forward, because there is only one direction to go. (At one point, Joe says explicitly something to the effect of "Well, based on how this day is going, I imagine I'll find some use for this [random object].") The game is called "Silent Age" for good cause: Most of the game is carried out in silence, which I found oppressive. Even Joe's interior monologue was almost completely text-based, instead of narrated. For point-and-click adventure enthusiasts, Silent Age may be worth picking up; otherwise, I think I'd suggest passing.","November 26, 2015","false","4.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I mean yeah, double-clicking theoretically makes him go faster, but it was a real janky mechanic and I could only get it to work some of the time. That wouldn't be so bad except that the actual puzzles are...not fun at all. Arbitrary logic, single-use items with no adequate excuse for why they disappear (I can carry a chainsaw around in my pocket and bother to get gas for it but I can only use it once? What?), which is typical point-and-click style except it doesn't even have the decency to be remotely funny or interesting about it. I think the game tried to make jokes with the dialogue but I am, very seriously, not sure about that. All that could be forgiven if the story were remotely original, interesting, or deceptive, but instead it seems to have compensated for a total lack of original or emotionally stirring ideas with an absolute feast of tropes pilfered from different, better stories and thrown together in a hideous patchwork.

It has retro-style minimalist artwork, and... no. Stop. The Silent Age attempts to capture some of the darker corners of the '70's - the brutality that resulted from the Cold War, the greed of the men who tried to take advantage of it, and their combined consequences. The puzzles aren't especially challenging, and you can't exactly say that it's one of those adventure games that's eschews puzzles to tell a story, because the story isn't amazing, either. But it is still compelling, if point-and-clicks are your jam, and the artwork is very well-done. A lot of the elements look flat, like paper cutouts, relying on shading to give them texture and dimension, and this non-descript artwork plays into the theme of an anonymous hero ("literally, the average Joe") in a world that seems much too big and imposing for him to make a difference. The soundtrack promotes the same feeling. The game definitely isn't creepy enough to be even mild horror, but it's just enough to be imposing and intriguing.\n\ntl;dr\n\nThe bad:\n- The voiceovers. Listening to them caused me pain\n- Puzzles aren't particularly challenging\n- Not extremely innovative story\n\nThe good:\n- It's retro\n- Minimalistic artwork is simple and elegant without being dull\n- Artwork fits the period and plays into the themes\n- The game seems to capture the spirit of the time\n- Great if you're into point-and-clicks\n- Great ambience/atmosphere\n\n\nOverall:\nIt's a classic point-and-click adventure with a flair for design.","July 15, 2015","true","1.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I didn't expect the game to be as humorous as it was at some points.\n\n- Some puzzles are very difficult to figure out, and I wouldn't have ever been able to solve them without a walkthrough.\n- The ending is somewhat anti-climactic and underwhelming, but I'm glad it wasn't too pessemistic, which is what I was expecting.\n\nOverall, I'd give this game a 7/10 and I'd recommend picking it up when it's on sale.","October 13, 2015","true","3.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The plot is trite, unimaginative, and like most time travel stories, runs afoul of internal inconsistencies.\n\nThe art style is nice enough, but the game seriously lacks detail; very few things beyond the player are animated. It looks and feels mostly like a flash game. (Doors, for example, fade from view when opened, rather than animating. That's only the most painfully obvious issue there though.)\n\nThe voice acting is hit and miss; not in quality, that's fine, but just that not all lines are voiced, so you often have to alternate between reading and listening.\n\nThe Silent Age's most glaring flaw beyond the rudimentary plot, is the gameplay however. The "puzzles" are no more advanced than "find object A, use on object B" with zero intervening steps in most cases. I don't think I spent more than a few seconds on any "puzzle" in the game. There are no alternative uses for items, you can't examine items you've picked up, there are no second uses for items(virtually every item you pick up is mysteriously destroyed after you use it once). The plot is completely linear, there is no branching or decision making.\n\nNote my playtime of 3.2 hours. That is the time it takes to beat the game, without skipping through any dialog or cutscenes. Most of which is probably spent waiting for dialog to finish, or fade-in, fade-out transitions to complete.\n\nAlso, the protagonist's dim-witted thinking, while it seems like it could be a charming plot element, is mostly the butt of jokes from some of the "smarter" characters in the game, and a cheap excuse to write dialog about the character not understanding or knowing anything about a fairly commonplace object. Nothing is ever done with this, and Joe remains an ignorant fool throughout, which is rapidly grating.\n\nThere IS, for a little while in the middle of the game, an interesting element of using time travel to swap back and forth through an area, but even that isn't a puzzle, as you simply clear out an area, swap times, and use the item(s) you've gathered in the other time. It could have been expanded upon and made far more interesting(as well as with recharging the time machine), but it's completely botched in execution instead.\n\nIf you're wanting to introduce a child to adventure games, or time travel, The Silent Age would be a good choice. For anyone more familiar with either genre, this is a complete waste of time.","September 12, 2015","false","3.2"," 8 of 20 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","8","20","0","0"

I played the original on android and eagerly awaited the second part. When it came out i was more than pleased. They then announced it was coming out on steam. Time for another play through i thought. I also wanted to support the company as (spoiler) this is an incredible game.\n\nI find it a bit odd for the characters to have voices, as i had given them voices in my head, but i understand it and think they have done a very good job. I have tried point and click games before and this is the only one that has really grabbed me. I cant really say how good it is as a point and click game though, the puzzles arent particualy hard but still provide a challenge. They all make sense but arent always obvious, which seems to be a good mix. This is aided by being able to switch between 1972 and 2012 (it makes sense in the story) which adds a second layer to just hunting for hidden objects.\n\nThe story is just so clever and you really connect with Joe (the main character) as you only ever really know as much as he does. The writing is really good, with Joe giving funny little quips when you try to do something that isnt possible or even just when he is reacting to whats happening. The atmosphere the game creates is really cool as it provides it with small glimpses of whatever is off in the horizon and sound effects that gives off a really haunting feeling.\n\nThis brings me on to the music. Ahh. The music. It all fits so well with the game and only adds to the atmosphere. Why they havnt released an official OST I dont know. As i have mentioned already, the sound design and OST add a really haunting feeling, which fits with the whole game so well.\n\nMy one main problem with the game is the length. I have two hours game time on steam and I have played the whole game through and gone back and got all the achievements that i missed. Although I suspect house on fire's answer would be 'what would you expect for £6'.\n\nI'm not very good at writing reviews (which should be quite obvious) but what im trying to say is that its a very good game and for only £6.99 (or your regional equivelent) you should definitely get it, if that doesn't sell it then consider that ive played it through at least 5 times on android and intend to play it many more times on steam.","July 10, 2015","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yes, you have played this game or read this book before, but The Silent Age manages to pull it off pleasantly for the most part.\n\nThe game takes the player on an intriguing but almost too conveniently straightforward adventure. Puzzles are mostly logical and situations generally ease in the right direction, though most of the time the main character's actions feel amply disconnected from the central objective. There's always the right item unambiguously right next to where you need it - and nothing else.\n\nLocations and settings appear somewhat inexpertly designed to serve a single purpose. Every area feels stiffly confined, highly improbable, and only part of an artificial world. They don't immediately feel very natural, yet this all contributes to making the game feel a bit dream-like. For instance, why is there a musician playing in a metro station that's obviously completely blocked to the public?\n\nThe use of instantaneous time travel is actually very appealing, letting the player switch between present and future in just one click. The only downside is that it soon becomes overused, often requiring to switch back and forth in every single screen just to move forward (for instance a door is opened in 1972 but closed in 2012). The main character quite literally could go nowhere without the device.\n\nThe game's take on time travel is never scientifically rigorous, or even remotely probable, though as that is not essential to the plot it is easily forgiven. Also surprisingly the few other characters that inhabit this world never seem to mind our protagonist zapping in and out of existence right before them. It does have passing references to other genre classics such as Back to the Future.\n\nThe art direction is a bit on the simplistic side, consisting of very flat 2D vector artwork with very few animations. Almost naive graphics nevertheless manage to capture a unique mood. Nice clean interface.\n\nThere is nothing particularly outstanding about the game but it nevertheless manages to retain an air of mystery throughout. All chapters are self-contained and relatively short. The storyline builds up some amount of tension and momentum but unfortunately ends rather abruptly. It is difficult to mention more without spoiling it so let's only say the underdeveloped ending was something of a let down. Many, many questions remain unanswered, and I was hoping for it to go out with a bang or an unexpected revelation.\n\nIf you like easy and short point and click adventures and time travel mysteries, this game can be fun for an evening or two.

Safe to say, not only did it not disappoint, it surpassed my expectations.\n\nGameplay: Great. Excellent mobile port of an otherwise excellent point and click story game. The puzzles are less of a challenge, but may pose as one if you do not prefer thinking outside the box. Perhaps the thing that separates this game from most point-and-click is Joe's cleverly-written dialogues/responses to certain scenarios. Narrative just shying away from being a dystopian Hollywood movie.\n\nReplayability: Neutral . No point in replaying but to complete achievements, but sometimes it's nice to re-live the experience, and the plot twists still get me sometimes.\n\nAudio: Good. The BGM does an excellent job in creating a creepy, unsettling feel all throughout the game. The silence parts were well-placed. Turn up the volume, play it at night, it'll ramp up the mood. As for the voice acting, in my opinion, fell a little flat. Not cringe-worthy though, just very average-sounding.\n\nVisuals: PERFECT. Nostalgic and apocalyptic at the same time, with a good dose of unsettling otherworldly eerieness. The art is breathtaking enough on mobile, then it gets the ultra HD treatment.

Joe, as a ordinary janitor, accidently got a time machine and was asked to save the world. you can use time machine to travel through time, things from the present differ from those from future. the end of story is a little predictable though, maybe because that ends of all time traveling stories are similar to each other.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chokehold/recommended/352520/","chokehold","chokehold","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chokehold/","381 products in account","Very impressed by this game.\n\nIt looks a bit simplistic, partially reminds me of MS Word Clipart. But together with the sound and the story, I was still drawn in and I think that I now kinda like that style. Not generally, for every adventure, but for this one.\n\nHaving played through it entirely, and despite all time-machinery, I think the story is conclusive, logical and actually quite close to reality. If there were such a thing as time travel, events like in this game may really happen. I think I could logically untangle most of the story, at least for my understanding of it there are no open ends.\n\nThe gameplay is relaxed and straight-forward, there are no "action sequences" where things jump at you unexpectedly or kill you for being unattentive, and there are no "you should've gotten item X two chapters back to solve riddle Y now" issues.\n\nA tutorial would've been great, took me a while to figure out that there's no need for a "look at item in inventory" function and so on. But still, you can control it with 1 mouse button so it didn't take long to figure out. ;)\n\nIts puzzles are fairly easy and logical, so thankfully you'll NEVER run into these typical and illogical "use wooden plank on boiling soup to create spaceship" moments that destroy other adventures. No 1-pixel-item hunts either. Best of all: NO FXXKING SLIDE PUZZLES!\n\nI'm and old-school 2D adventure player, I grew up with the old Monkey Island, King's Quest, Police Quest etc. games. I'm also a Steam achievement hunter. So I tend to stay in single rooms for quite long, looking for and at all sorts of things repetitively, combining strange object combinations time and time again, and as every adventure player knows: if there's one item in something, there might be another one - so look again. Going through an achievement guide for this game (after completing it) to see what I'd missed, I thought several times "but I did EXACTLY that". Come on, a trash can that has something in it. I DEFINITELY checked twice, yet I didn't get the achievement. (Turns out that between two attempts one needs to move Joe away and back again... *sigh*) An apple. A computer. Programmer's humour. Come on, I DEFINITELY tried that (with both apples), yet I didn't get the achievement. So something in there might be slightly buggy or unreliable.\n\nApart from this, I experienced no issues, no crashes, no "stuck at positions" or anything of that kind, very solid game. Reading through the community pages, it seems the devs are fairly responsive and actively fix bugs. So that's a big PRO as well.\n\nAll in all, this has been a very positive experience from start to beginning.\nThe devs seem to be working on a new (non sequel) game, I'm both curious and thrilled to see what that's going to be.","December 5, 2015","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is short and sweet with logical problems to solve as well as subtle pop culture references and era/scene setting (in the opening cut scene we see that he was indeed drafted in the Vietnam War) without being over-the-top.\n\nDespite how one-dimensional Joe-the character you play as-is, I still felt for him. He's honestly just a very average guy with average abilities who gets caught up in something out of a sci-fi book. And after the whole ride is over, I still felt some semblance of pity because of how much the world he knew drastically changed.\n\nThe music stung at the right moments, and the art style is wonderfully sleek and minimalist, with an easy-to-use inventory and a fairly large hollow circle to serve as a signal for interactable objects. No pixel-hunting in this game!\n\nMeaningless analysis and personal discussion of Joe below:\n\nThe epilogue shows him surrounded by people with completely different clothes and one guy holding an iPod. In the next scene he's touring a cultural museum that highlights the fashion and trends of the 70s, which probably made him feel the oddest sense of melancholy and peace. "This is my time period", though he only lived to see 1970-72 before being frozen. Can you even imagine how much of a culture shock it would have been? Undoubtedly everyone he knew as a colleague or family is probably very advanced in years or dead, it having been 40 years between cryosleep and being reawakened.

A great weight is placed upon him as he trys to stop the seemingly inevitable future. Including a mixture of text and voice for the characters made a huge difference in the quality of the story. I enjoyed all encounters with NPCs because they all had their own personalities and positions that made them unique, which gave them vital roles within Silent Age's story. The puzzles make sense and are sometimes humorous. Most objects that you can interact with commonly give hints that really help the story progress if you happen to get stuck on what to do next. It's a game well worth playing that will keep you interested throughout the entire playthrough. I had many theories as the story progressed, but I was not suspecting the ending. If you are into point and click, this is definitely a game to have.","July 18, 2015","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You find yourself solving puzzles in ways that look like they came straight out of a saturday morning cartoon. The time travel mechanic is the best part. Usually an item or area you need to reach can only be accessed in one time period, and the items you find there are useful in another.\n\nThis game is great if you like point-and-click titles with a good story.

It was probably the fact that it was born as a mobile game, which is never a plus as far as I'm concerned (everything that's conceived as a casual game is pretty much going to suck). Anyway, I'm glad I decided to do that during a winter sale, as, besides the amazing art and music, I was rewarded with a very nice gaming experience.\n\nFirst of all, if you love AG, be aware that this game is pretty short (it took me about 4 hours and I doubt you'll need more), you only use a single button to do everything (Broken Age style, not really a plus in my book but it does its job), and puzzles are not very hard either. Nevertheless, why you'll never get stuck, puzzles are often quite clever, as they'll typically require you to think in terms of present/future terms to work around things.\n\nTime travel is the very premise of this little gem, and you'll immediately find your "average Joe" main character to be involved in something much bigger than him: a dying messenger from the future and his portable time machine, which you'll have to use to find him (!) and warn him about the apocalypse that is going to come. I won't say more not to spoil the experience (the game is short, as I was saying), but the sci-fi story is really cool and well told: some things may turn up to be more or less predictable, but you'll always find yourself wondering what's going to happen next up to the finale.\n\nHighly recommended!","January 1","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pablomakaveli/recommended/352520/","pablomakaveli","pablomakaveli","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pablomakaveli/","813 products in account","TL:DR : this is a pretty decent point and click adventure game where you can use time travel (travelling between the games present in the 1970's to 40 years in the future and then back) to solve puzzles. Its is a bit short but enjoyable nonetheless. Worth picking up for an affordable point and click game with a decent story.\n\nFull version:\n\nSilent Age has you playing as Joe, a lowly janitor in a big corporation building in the 1970's. When Joe's colleague suddenly leaves, Joe finds himself stuck with the extra duties and in doing so discovers a dying old man from the future who warns him of an impending apocalypse that Joe must now try and prevent. Joe is given a time travel device which allows him to jump 40 years into the future and back at the press of a button.\n\nThe game revolves around point and click style gameplay where you solve puzzles using items you pick up with the time travel element adding a bit of a twist. For example you might need to open a door in a corridor in the present, you use the time machine to jump forward to the future version of that same corridor, find an item to open the door and go back to the present and use it.\n\nGood points:\n- the story is quite enjoyable, and given the that time travel is usually a subject that is either done really well or really bad they've done a good job of it in this game\n- the puzzles arent too difficult with most of them having a logical solution rather than extremely abstract ones like some other point and click games. Being able to jump betweem the present and future is kind of cool as well. Being able to see what is a normal building in the present turn into a crumbling wreck littered with skeletons in the future is pretty enjoyable\n- this was originally a mobile game and the developers have added improved graphics for pc as well as voice acting rather than just a lazy straight port\n\nBad points:\n- its pretty short (about 3-4 hours) but any longer would have been dragging it out and for its price the length isnt too bad\n","January 3","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But together with the sound and the story, I was still drawn in and I think that I now kinda like that style. Not generally, for every adventure, but for this one.\n\nHaving played through it entirely, and despite all time-machinery, I think the story is conclusive, logical and actually quite close to reality. If there were such a thing as time travel, events like in this game may really happen. I think I could logically untangle most of the story, at least for my understanding of it there are no open ends.\n\nThe gameplay is relaxed and straight-forward, there are no "action sequences" where things jump at you unexpectedly or kill you for being unattentive, and there are no "you should've gotten item X two chapters back to solve riddle Y now" issues.\n\nA tutorial would've been great, took me a while to figure out that there's no need for a "look at item in inventory" function and so on. But still, you can control it with 1 mouse button so it didn't take long to figure out. ;)\n\nIts puzzles are fairly easy and logical, so thankfully you'll NEVER run into these typical and illogical "use wooden plank on boiling soup to create spaceship" moments that destroy other adventures. No 1-pixel-item hunts either. Best of all: NO FXXKING SLIDE PUZZLES!\n\nI'm and old-school 2D adventure player, I grew up with the old Monkey Island, King's Quest, Police Quest etc. games. I'm also a Steam achievement hunter. So I tend to stay in single rooms for quite long, looking for and at all sorts of things repetitively, combining strange object combinations time and time again, and as every adventure player knows: if there's one item in something, there might be another one - so look again. Going through an achievement guide for this game (after completing it) to see what I'd missed, I thought several times "but I did EXACTLY that". Come on, a trash can that has something in it. I DEFINITELY checked twice, yet I didn't get the achievement. (Turns out that between two attempts one needs to move Joe away and back again... *sigh*) An apple. A computer. Programmer's humour. Come on, I DEFINITELY tried that (with both apples), yet I didn't get the achievement. So something in there might be slightly buggy or unreliable.\n\nApart from this, I experienced no issues, no crashes, no "stuck at positions" or anything of that kind, very solid game. Reading through the community pages, it seems the devs are fairly responsive and actively fix bugs. So that's a big PRO as well.\n\nAll in all, this has been a very positive experience from start to beginning.\nThe devs seem to be working on a new (non sequel) game, I'm both curious and thrilled to see what that's going to be.","December 5, 2015","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You're Joe, a janitor, and you end up having a device that lets you travel between two points in time, and you'll need it to solve puzzles and access places you otherwise couldn't in your current time and location. All to save the world.\n\nIt's one of those simpler games, no combining items in your inventory, no way to impede progress, and the puzzles are actually quite straightforward if you just think about it. None of those The-Longest-Journey-esque atrocities. That being said, you'll breeze by the game because you won't really get stuck, but that's a good thing for this one, because the story, while predictable for time travel buffs, is actually decent. It'll definitely scratch an itch.\n\nYou'll finish in one to two sessions, but it'll be a good one/two sessions.","September 12, 2015","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's 2D and very nicely done.  You have to solve problems, sometimes using time travel as part of the solution.  One minor quibble I have is that some problems could have been solved in various ways with what the protagonist had to work with, but the game only accepts the one arbitrary solution.  I used a walk-through from time to time when I was stuck, but if you have more time and patience than me, you might get through it without a walk-through.  It was a good story and I cared about the characters.","September 14, 2015","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is a small conn about the ending.\n\nOverall\nThe best part of this game is the story while it does get a little creepy at times I really enjoyed it, and traveling between two periods in time to solve puzzles is a really good idea.

YOU SHOULD BUY IT!!!! ITS AMAZING!!!! THE END!!!11!!!!ONE!!!!!\n\nLonger review:\nVery well made Point and CLick adventure game. It looks amazing are surprizingly runs at 60fps at max settings on fairly low-grade hardware (I have a core i5 with no graphics card so maybe not the lowest end stuff but still reliable).\n\nIt has a very interesting story and likable characters. The bigest addition from the original ios game (which I played) is the new voice acting, which I think they did a good job with and gives the characters more personality.\n\nThe puzzles in the game are fun to think about and almost none of the puzzles make no sense. However, not all of the puzzles make much sense in real life Ex:  A tanning bulb probably should not fit into a standard lamp socket.  But even the puzzles you may get stuck on can be solved eventually with little hair-loss.\n\nThis game's pace also makes it like you are reading a book (a good sign).\n\n\n\nEnding remarks:\nI recommend this game to anyone who likes post-apocolyptic games with some good humor snuck into the dialogue. It is also a good first point-and-click game if you've never played one.\n\n10/10 Would accept a time machine from a dying old man again\n\nAlso, forgive me for the formatting of this review, I've never written a full review before.","February 13","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I finished it in 3.9h and that's including achievement hunting. I used a guide to find a few missable achievements I needed but other than that I took my time because I enjoyed the minimalistic art style and the setting.\n\nThe good:\nDouble clicking makes the character run. It's a godsend of a feature that some point-and-click adventure games forget to have for some odd reason. Running everywhere all the time alleviates the slowness of the game.\n\nThe art style is great.\n\nThe bad (or more specifically the annoying):\nI missed quite a few text popups because I was in the middle of doing something or I thought there will not be anything else because it takes a while for the old message to change into the new one. This makes the game a little on the slow side if you really want to read everything.\n\nThe good and the bad:\nThe items that you use disappear after just one use so you know when you have used it correctly and it means you don't have to wander around trying to mix and match items on every occasion, however, it makes the whole story a bit arbitrary. Meaning that you know that you are supposed to find some specific item that you need in any given area since all the items you found before have disappeared. So every area has all the necessary items conveniently scattered around the area in order for you to progress in the story.\n\nConclusion:\nEven though the story gets a little predictable at the end, the game is still fun and enjoyable despite some of the drawbacks I have mentioned before. If you like somewhat linear story lines and don't mind not rushing through them then this game is for you.","December 25, 2015","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The voice acting was a nice new touch, but at times I felt like the voices didn't match the narrative.\nMy one real gripe, if that, is the game is normally $9.99. I beat the game in 3 hours and only missed 4 acheivements, so I feel like the game is a little steep in price for playtime.

Yes, you have played this game or read this book before, but The Silent Age manages to pull it off pleasantly for the most part.\n\nThe game takes the player on an intriguing but almost too conveniently straightforward adventure. Puzzles are mostly logical and situations generally ease in the right direction, though most of the time the main character's actions feel amply disconnected from the central objective. There's always the right item unambiguously right next to where you need it - and nothing else.\n\nLocations and settings appear somewhat inexpertly designed to serve a single purpose. Every area feels stiffly confined, highly improbable, and only part of an artificial world. They don't immediately feel very natural, yet this all contributes to making the game feel a bit dream-like. For instance, why is there a musician playing in a metro station that's obviously completely blocked to the public?\n\nThe use of instantaneous time travel is actually very appealing, letting the player switch between present and future in just one click. The only downside is that it soon becomes overused, often requiring to switch back and forth in every single screen just to move forward (for instance a door is opened in 1972 but closed in 2012). The main character quite literally could go nowhere without the device.\n\nThe game's take on time travel is never scientifically rigorous, or even remotely probable, though as that is not essential to the plot it is easily forgiven. Also surprisingly the few other characters that inhabit this world never seem to mind our protagonist zapping in and out of existence right before them. It does have passing references to other genre classics such as Back to the Future.\n\nThe art direction is a bit on the simplistic side, consisting of very flat 2D vector artwork with very few animations. Almost naive graphics nevertheless manage to capture a unique mood. Nice clean interface.\n\nThere is nothing particularly outstanding about the game but it nevertheless manages to retain an air of mystery throughout. All chapters are self-contained and relatively short. The storyline builds up some amount of tension and momentum but unfortunately ends rather abruptly. It is difficult to mention more without spoiling it so let's only say the underdeveloped ending was something of a let down. Many, many questions remain unanswered, and I was hoping for it to go out with a bang or an unexpected revelation.\n\nIf you like easy and short point and click adventures and time travel mysteries, this game can be fun for an evening or two.

But it also has some game mechanic inconsistancies ( I don't want to spoil anything, but things don't always follow the same rules), and a really predictable story - if you read much scifi at all.  But knowing/figuring out the main "twist" doesn't negate the pleasure of following the story, and not every game needs to be utterly surprising or intense, or 30 hours long. So, manage expectations, and know it's only about 4 hours long and it's a good game.

It was probably the fact that it was born as a mobile game, which is never a plus as far as I'm concerned (everything that's conceived as a casual game is pretty much going to suck). Anyway, I'm glad I decided to do that during a winter sale, as, besides the amazing art and music, I was rewarded with a very nice gaming experience.\n\nFirst of all, if you love AG, be aware that this game is pretty short (it took me about 4 hours and I doubt you'll need more), you only use a single button to do everything (Broken Age style, not really a plus in my book but it does its job), and puzzles are not very hard either. Nevertheless, why you'll never get stuck, puzzles are often quite clever, as they'll typically require you to think in terms of present/future terms to work around things.\n\nTime travel is the very premise of this little gem, and you'll immediately find your "average Joe" main character to be involved in something much bigger than him: a dying messenger from the future and his portable time machine, which you'll have to use to find him (!) and warn him about the apocalypse that is going to come. I won't say more not to spoil the experience (the game is short, as I was saying), but the sci-fi story is really cool and well told: some things may turn up to be more or less predictable, but you'll always find yourself wondering what's going to happen next up to the finale.\n\nHighly recommended!","January 1","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Safe to say, not only did it not disappoint, it surpassed my expectations.\n\nGameplay: Great. Excellent mobile port of an otherwise excellent point and click story game. The puzzles are less of a challenge, but may pose as one if you do not prefer thinking outside the box. Perhaps the thing that separates this game from most point-and-click is Joe's cleverly-written dialogues/responses to certain scenarios. Narrative just shying away from being a dystopian Hollywood movie.\n\nReplayability: Neutral . No point in replaying but to complete achievements, but sometimes it's nice to re-live the experience, and the plot twists still get me sometimes.\n\nAudio: Good. The BGM does an excellent job in creating a creepy, unsettling feel all throughout the game. The silence parts were well-placed. Turn up the volume, play it at night, it'll ramp up the mood. As for the voice acting, in my opinion, fell a little flat. Not cringe-worthy though, just very average-sounding.\n\nVisuals: PERFECT. Nostalgic and apocalyptic at the same time, with a good dose of unsettling otherworldly eerieness. The art is breathtaking enough on mobile, then it gets the ultra HD treatment.

Yes, you have played this game or read this book before, but The Silent Age manages to pull it off pleasantly for the most part.\n\nThe game takes the player on an intriguing but almost too conveniently straightforward adventure. Puzzles are mostly logical and situations generally ease in the right direction, though most of the time the main character's actions feel amply disconnected from the central objective. There's always the right item unambiguously right next to where you need it - and nothing else.\n\nLocations and settings appear somewhat inexpertly designed to serve a single purpose. Every area feels stiffly confined, highly improbable, and only part of an artificial world. They don't immediately feel very natural, yet this all contributes to making the game feel a bit dream-like. For instance, why is there a musician playing in a metro station that's obviously completely blocked to the public?\n\nThe use of instantaneous time travel is actually very appealing, letting the player switch between present and future in just one click. The only downside is that it soon becomes overused, often requiring to switch back and forth in every single screen just to move forward (for instance a door is opened in 1972 but closed in 2012). The main character quite literally could go nowhere without the device.\n\nThe game's take on time travel is never scientifically rigorous, or even remotely probable, though as that is not essential to the plot it is easily forgiven. Also surprisingly the few other characters that inhabit this world never seem to mind our protagonist zapping in and out of existence right before them. It does have passing references to other genre classics such as Back to the Future.\n\nThe art direction is a bit on the simplistic side, consisting of very flat 2D vector artwork with very few animations. Almost naive graphics nevertheless manage to capture a unique mood. Nice clean interface.\n\nThere is nothing particularly outstanding about the game but it nevertheless manages to retain an air of mystery throughout. All chapters are self-contained and relatively short. The storyline builds up some amount of tension and momentum but unfortunately ends rather abruptly. It is difficult to mention more without spoiling it so let's only say the underdeveloped ending was something of a let down. Many, many questions remain unanswered, and I was hoping for it to go out with a bang or an unexpected revelation.\n\nIf you like easy and short point and click adventures and time travel mysteries, this game can be fun for an evening or two.

I was already a big fan of the iOS version of The Silent Age. The Steam port is even better than the original, if only because of the new voice-over work that enhances Frank's personality as well as the old-school point-and-click feel of the game. Listening to Dr. Lambert say "ninny" out loud made me chuckle with Lost in Space nostalgia.

The visual style is terriffic. Animations are minimal but the aesthetic works. The sound and music are also good. The voice acting is OK. Not great, but so many games do so much worse.\n\nThe time travel mechanic is really cool.\n\nMost of the puzzles involve figuring out how to open various doors. To keep things interesting, the game tries not to repeat itself, but unfortunately that means the solutions become more and more absurd.\n\nFortunately, the game does not offer much in the way of red herrings, and as soon as you use an inventory item, it disappears. This neatly avoids the frustration of having a dozen inventory items and trying out all 66 combinations until something works. But it also means the game is not very challenging.\n\nBottom line: watch the trailer video and, if you dig the music and the visual style, you will probably enjoy playing this game. But if you're itching for a challenge, this will not scratch it.","May 1","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You play Joe, who is literally an average Joe in 1972 who comes in contact with time travel and threats of total global annihilation. While none of the puzzles are incredibly difficult (though they had just the right amount of "aha!" moments to satisfy), the mechanics are solid and the story is amazing. There is a time-travel element that must be used to solve the puzzles, and you get to see glimpses of a desolate future as you switch back and forth between your time and the future. Plus there's a couple of Back to the Future references in there if you're paying attention.\n\nPros:\n+GREAT story. Just the right mix between the spooky, eerie feeling of a world about to end, a world already ended, and the light humor of an average Joe who is just trying to figure it all out.\n+Voice acting is sparse, and mostly just in cutscenes, but what there is of it is good.\n+Spooky, atmospheric music. The game recommends playing with headphones in, but it's not really necessary (i.e. no puzzles require the ability to distinguish between the direction of sounds, or whatever). However, it does really help to draw you into the game and the world.\n+Interesting puzzles. Nothing truly groundbreaking, and it's one of those adventure games where items disappear after they're used, so your inventory never gets bogged down with useless crap.\n\nCons:\n-Short, but honestly it's still worth it. Took me about 3 hours.\n-There is a second or two delay between clicking on an item and getting its description (which is always text, not spoken, unfortunately). It's not a big deal, but it really kinda slowed down the game a bit. I'm really stretching here. This isn't game breaking, just a teensy bit annoying after playing the game straight through in one sitting.\n\n9/10. Super great.","April 9","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The art style and the voice acting in this game are next level. Now, with that being said, let me also say that this game isn't very long (3-3.5 hours max) but, even though the game is short the story told within the game and the art style and design behind it drive this indie game to next level story telling. This is one of the most fun point and click games I have ever played, and it for sure is the best story driven one I've played.\n\nPros:Story rich\nArt style in this game is next level\nTime travel mechanics work flawlessly\nPuzzles are hard, but not so hard that it frustrates you\nJumping from time to time and seeing the world in different times is awesome\nCharacter and story development have a nice pace\nCons:Pretty short game\nSomewhat generic ending (you can see it coming early on)\nOverall, this game is worth trying out if you're into time travel, cool art styles, or a dope storyline. I personally got the game during a Steam sale and picked it up for like 3 bucks which I think is more reasonable than the $10 USD that they ask for, but the game is still good nonetheless.\n9.5/10 would be 10/10 if the game was just a tad longer.\n\nSPOILER BELOW:\nI kind of thought I was the one that killed the world with the disease a long time coming before it actually explains what really happens in game, but the ending of the game kind of messed with me being in cyro and then being woken up years later.
