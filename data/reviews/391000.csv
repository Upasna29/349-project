Starts at a slow pace, but gets rather intense on higher levels.\n\nWARNING! 5 of of 12 games (Farm Frenzy, Farm Frenzy 2, Farm Frenzy: Pizza Party, Farm Frenzy 3, Farm Frenzy 3: American Pie) have intense screen blinking in full screen mode on Windows 10 OS. The remedy is to switch to windowed mode (either in the game options or by using Alt+Enter combination).\n\n7/10 for me.","November 5, 2015","true","2.4"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

This game is fun and addicting! If a puzzle married farming simulator, the baby would be Farm frenzy collection. I am sorry to have played a pirated versions, until I found the whole series for more than modest price on one of Steam sales, compared to how much fun it gave me.\nPros:\n* Kids firendly!\n* 12 games for the price of one!\n* Doesn't  require very powrfull PC or a lot of disk space.\n* Engaging gameplay!\n* Puzzles to solve!\n* Zero violence.\n* Lovely cartony graphics.\n* Different from one of those annoying Facebook farming games.\n* High Fun factor.\n* Addictive.\n* Onboarding in this game is one of the best in the genre.\nCons\n* It's an older game so it doesn't scale up to big high resolution screens, windowed mode works like a charm tough.\n* Not a real simulator obviously.\n* It's more a puzzle, less tomagochi, so if you want to grow pets look elsewhere!\n* Music sounds go on repeat all the time, it might annoy some people.\n* Cartoony graphics might not be to some peoples taste.\n\n","April 3","true","265.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The only downside is that I'm having intense screen flickering on the first five games in the collection when they are played in full screen mode like other people have been mentioning.  Playing in windowed-mode fixes the problem but then you're forced to play the game in a small frame.  I should mention I'm using Windows 10.\n\nIt's not the worst problem to have and hopefully it'll be fixed at some point but people should still be aware of this issue.","November 30, 2015","true","11.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

If you like one, you'd as might as well play them all over time. Having them all gives a little change if you are bored.","May 1","true","203.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
