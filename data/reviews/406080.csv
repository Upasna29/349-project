The graphics are awful, with it not being clear which screen elements are part of the UI and which are just there for looks, and the gameplay is dull and repetitive.\n\nYou basically take turns adjusting which kinds of ants you want, buying upgrades, and occasionally engaging in a random battle with bugs and such. Every part of this is dull; even the battles consist of clicking "Attack" or "Retreat" and then seeing numbers change.\n\nAlso, if you are getting SimAnt vibes, you're wrong; it's more like a crappy business management sim that replaces business with ants. There is no real time aspect to this at all; it's just tweaking numbers and then clicking the button to move on to the next turn and see what happens.\n\nHighly advise against wasting your time on this.","October 3, 2015","false","0.3"," 225 of 268 people (84%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","84","225","268","18","17"

Game is built to grind and can be repetative.\nPretty much one of the oldest clicker games out there.\nMaybe get on sale (>50%)\n9.5/10\n\nLong Review\n\nSo I see many of negative reviews and I do agree with many of them, but I will have to totally recommend this little piece of gem as I grab it as soon as I saw it.\n\nI first played this game maybe 8 or 9 years ago, don't even remember how I even got my hands on it and I totally loved it, made my day everyday seeing my colony grow and fight with the believible surroundings that you can pretty much live it as if it was real. Yes, you may probably get this game for free somewhere out there (just like many games in steam) but I just wanted to own this little gem in my library and also a way to support the devs that make my(as well as many's) childhood a little bit brighter. I mean 2$ that cost less than a cup of coffee. You have no obligation to buy this game so please don't whine about it for it being not free, no one's forcing you to buy the game.\n\nYes, to point out many reviews out there, that this game is indeed repetitive and is a grinding game. I mean which grinding game is not repetitive? If you don't like to grind then by all means dont get this game, no need to fill the reviews  with all the negatives its not fair for the game since you guys are just stating the obvious.\n\nTo put it in a polite way, clicker game, is better suited term than a grinding game. This maybe infact one of the oldest clicker games out there. Note that I spent over 16 hours in the game and that contribute to around 6000 days in the in-game time. Say I click around 30 - 60 clicks (combinding fights and whatnot) I spend the time clicking around 270,000 times!! I am not a fan of the clicker genre but man this game is fun and also frustating at times. I sometimes think this is one of those games that are made to make chidrends shut up.\n\nSo all in all, its a pretty decent game with hand-drawn annimations and keep in mind this is a pretty darn old game. As I mentioned, this is not a game for everyone, especially those that don't like games being repetitive. Grab it while on sale or even at full price I would say it is worth it.\n\n9.5/10","October 24, 2015","true","16.2"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

I would never recommend this game to anyone though. It's fraught with flaws.\n\nFirst of all, the UI is extremely odd, and can be very confusing to navigate. The whole game is a clicking simulator, which isn't bad for some, as games of the like are usually great ways to pass the time, which is one redeeming factor the game has. The art. HOOOOOLY CRAP the art. The whole game is literally clip art images that you can easily find on google, some of which have been animated very simply (we're talking a few pivot points on some images in like, Adobe AfterEffects). The music and sound effects are maddingly repetitive, as well as the "battle" sequences which are just some more clicking (if you win you get some stuff if not oh well).\n\nEssentially, this game is horrendous, if you buy it, use it to waste time and only to do so. If you have some nostalgia to deal with like I did, go right ahead, I love this game sure, but that doesn't make it good. Sort of like loving a terrible, terrible, movie.\n\nTL;DR: I played this game as a kid and loved it, still love it, but it's still terrible.","October 9, 2015","false","0.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

You take the lead of an ant colony and must build up your army until you take over the world. You’ll need to breed ants, get food, and build up your army so that you can defend yourself from the world.\n\nTo manage your ants, you must set what percentage of each type you'll have doing that job. Gathering food and having a decent army are all pretty important. The more you grow your colony, the tougher your opponents will become.\n\nThe problem with Ant War is that is all you do. You set what percentage of each type do each job and then just watch, sometimes interacting when it comes to doing battle. Sometimes, even if you're able to win a battle, the game will still suggest you run away. The goal is so exceptionally high that it's not something you'll just complete in a few hours.\n\nI cannot recommend Ant War: Domination at all, and I'd rather recommend you find a game that actually lets you interact a bit more. The constant "Like us on Facebook!" ads also get exceptionally annoying whenever you level up, and really do make it feel like a flash game (perhaps because it was one).","December 8, 2015","false","6.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

The events that happen have no effect in the game other than boring battles. This I think other than the battles is the worse part to the game because it feels random and not very interesting. Who cares that I conquer another colony? Tell me what I have gained from this.\n-once going to all of the locations, game lacks replayability\n-The enemies show no differences in attack and defence stats.

Then repeat.  Very casual.\n\nI enjoyed the game somewhat, but there were a few things that lead me to not recommend:\n\n1. Enemy strength scaling.  Their power is always based on yours and that includes when you have set aside population as soldiers so basically it's just a waste.  You will usually be underpowered and have to retreat and lose ants.  You can't feel like you have grown strong enough to dominate an area.\n\n2.  Bonus scaling.  Bonuses per day are fixed but growth is curved, so anything you've gotten in the past fades into irrelevance.\n\n3. Unspecific events.  Sometimes things happen but they don't always say how big an impact they had.\n\n4. Autobattle (completely needed to battle) can only be used if the advisor thinks it's unloseable,  but that's too conservative sometimes.\n","October 28, 2015","false","4.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/admiralmondo/recommended/406080/","admiralmondo","Mondo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/admiralmondo/","453 products in account","This is a very simple game, reminiscent of an idle game, except you have to click "Go" rather than wait for things to scroll.   The game mostly consists of clicking go, with short bursts of splitting your colony between four different tasks, moving to a new location to encounter different events, and buying things from a store using a rare currency you might encounter.  Events can vary a lot, ranging from free food, to battles with roaming critters or people.\n\nUnfortunately the control you have over these events is very small.  It's expected that they be random, but the game doesn't even tell you what some of them do.  My ant colony had been poisoned multiple times while I was in the house, with no visible effect.  Weather changes at random, there's a temperature gauge, being indoors lets you avoid weather, but...I have no idea what any of the weather does.  Many locations are listed as being good for something, but I have failed to notice any of those areas coming through on thei rpromise.\n\nBattles also happen as random events, the idea being that you have to assign a certain number of ants as soldiers in order to overcome an area's encounters.  It seems like the stats of encounters just goes up if you assign more soldiers, though, resulting in a roughly even chance of victory regardless of how many soldiers you assign.  Battles consist solely of either hitting the attack button repeatedly (sometimes 50+ times) or deciding to retreat.  There's an auto-battle button, but auto-battling includes the retreat option, there's no feature that simply automates hitting the attack button.  And the AI will almost always choose to retreat.  Even when the chance of taking damage is miniscule, or even absolutely zero, the AI may decide that the battle isn't worth it and it'd rather lose the standardized 0.5% of your ants for running away.\n\nYour other ant jobs aren't much more useful.  None of them are really transparent as far as numbers are concerned, and they seem to operate off of certain plateaus that change sometimes, but without a discernable reason.  The worst part is that the effectiveness of every job is dwarfed besides the bonuses you can get from the gem shop (which thankfully doesn't take real world cash, despite what the name might imply).  Harvesters are the only job that you'll really need any amount of ants in, but that job is also rather pointless in appearance when compared to the random food events.\n\nOverall, the game obscures all of the necessary information to play it, and seemingly does so because if you saw any of the games inner mechanics you'd be appalled at how broken and ridiculous they are.  The makers of this game aren't just Anarchists, they're pratically criminals, creating games like this to make a cheap buck off of people who don't know any better.  I would not recommend this game under any circumstances.","October 8, 2015","false","3.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/juicyfarts/recommended/406080/","juicyfarts","RecordBreaker301","http://steamcommunity.com/id/juicyfarts/","185 products in account","The concept behind Ant War is good. It's a very simplistic, easy to manage strategy game that originally came out in 2003. I remember playing the original version, and enjoying it very much, however the full game was not freeware, like several people are saying.\n\nTo my knowledge, the *demo* was free, the full game needed to be bought otherwise the demo would stop your progress after a certain point, but I could be wrong. It's hard to remember exactly how I got it, but I do remember getting the full version and getting fairly far.\n\nIf you are looking for a sophisticated and challenging strategy game, Ant war certainly doesn't deliver in those departments. The visuals are lazy, the difficulty is absurdly easy, and the gui menus aren't the best either. It eventually boils down to you needing to spam click the continue button over and over with an ocassional fight, which requires even more clicking. At this point, the game feels more akin to cookie clicker or clicker heroes as you watch your numbers slowly increase.\n\nHowever, if you enjoy addictive clicker style games for wasting a bit of time, Ant war does indeed deliver fun, mindless enjoyment. It's definitely not perfect, and there is clearly room for improvement in every aspect. More upgrades, better menus with more statistics, and for the love of god better art design. My biggest complaint is the nasty clip-art-♥♥♥ cartoon characters that seemed to have been made in 10 minutes in MS paint. Even the backgrounds look like random locations they snagged off of google and put filters on. If the developers decide to do anything else with this game, I would extremely recommend an art design revision.","October 5, 2015","true","7.2"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"
