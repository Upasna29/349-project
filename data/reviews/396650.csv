"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JCAPER24/recommended/396650/","JCAPER24","[IV] JCAP","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JCAPER24/","78 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nDo I recommend it, even though this is only the first episode? Yes I do.\n\nThe scores below are from 1 to 10, 1 being terrible, 5 being average and 10 being excellent. I am confident in this Visual Novel and I think it can be one of the best Western Visual Novels. Keep in mind that the scale I am using is the same that I use to evaluate japanese visual novels (like Grisaia no Kajitsu):\n\nStory: Not rated at the moment (episode 1)Since this is only the first episode and was pretty much about introductions (and there's still another girl to be introduced in the next episode), I can't rate the story. My personal thoughts are that this is going to be a straightforward comedy slice of life romantic visual novel, so I don't expect any serious developments or mind blows.\n\nThere's not really much I can say about writing. It focuses on the dialogue and the protag thoughts, and doesn't waste time in detailing objects/sceneries. It's an easy to read writing and direct to the point.\n\nThere are some references and easter eggs. One of the best scenes in this visual novel is a small battle between the MC, Kaori and a Tech Gosu. Their battle is a little parody between Android, Apple and Microsoft. Another is when choosing a movie, you get to choose a movie of a list of movies that all are based off real movies, and the characters leave their comment on it.\n\nVisuals: 7The backgrounds are just too good. The artist makes such a good job of using lightning to give more life to the backgrounds.\nThe characters also look good in my opinion. The big drawback here is that, probably due to financial limits, secondary characters don't have fully drawn sprites. Meaning that their sprites are just black figures.\n\nGameplay: 9This visual novel, just like many others, is about making choices. Difference is that this one has tons of choices that drastically change the story, while the others only have a few. If you need a comparison, compare it to Walking Dead videogame from Telltalles games. Some choices only change a few lines, while others change a lot of what happens. For example, earlier in the game, you can choose to go to school by bus or with the bike. Depending on what you choose, it will change what characters you meet first and what will happen in the next day. Not only that, but if you decide to be an A hole with someone, that someone will remember it later and act accordingly.\n\nThere's also the rollback feature. Rollback is the feature that allows you to rollback to your previous choice and choose another option. In this VN, you are asked in the begginning if you want to disable it. If you do, you will get achievements and "other possible goodies".\n\nYou can also name your protagonist and choose his background trait: athletic, intelligent and intuitive. If you choose to be athletic, you will have no problem carrying luggage, if you choose to be intelligent, other characters might ask for your help with the studies, etc. This also sometimes highlights the best options in some choices, for example, if the teacher asks a question, the correct answer will be highlighted if you chose the intelligent trait.\n\nThis visual novel also features mini games. In the first episode, there are two type of mini games, if there will be more or not in the future I don't know. One is a simple press the right combination of 5 buttons scattered around the screen. In this episode, it appears only once to callibrate the MC's mech. To be honest that minigame feels unnecessary (especially because your penalty for failing is just repeating the mini game), however one of the devs said that he plans to use it again later, so I assume that this one can serve as a tutorial kind of thing.\n\nThe other mini game is the combat. I am pleased that they improved it a lot since the alpha. Now it's a lot better and it feels like I am actually doing some damage. This mini game is simple: Just press WASD according to what appears on the screen. If it appears W, press W and your combo will go up. You have limited energy and the enemy has HP. Depending on how well you do in the combat, the other characters will react to it (if you did well, they will praise you, etc). However, the bad side is that the mini game is too easy (for me at least).\n\nSound: 7They really did a good job here. The music is good and one of the tracks even got stuck in my ear (it's one that plays when riding the bike if we choose to go to school with it). That's a lot more than I can say for many visual novels. You see, I am like this: if I like the music that is playing, I continue to play the VN with it on, if I don't, I turn off the music and play my own. I didn't turn off the music in this VN.\n\nThe voice acting is also good. The voices match very well with the characters (Shou especially). Obviously, we are talking about low budget voice acting, so don't expect voice acting on Morgan Freeman level (aka God level). It's good, but not something that will blow you away. But considering that one can count english voice acted visual novels with just one hand, this is a really good effort from the devs.\n\nHowever, there are at least two moments where secondary characters don't have voice. Considering that I reported this in the last alpha, I am going to assume that their lack of voice is intentional and not a bug. This is weird because everyone else is voiced. I will update this if they add voices later.\n\nCharacters: Not going to rate yetSome of the characters are inspired by your usual japanese anime stereotypes, like tsundere. However, they don't shamessly try to imitate them to the letter, which is good, because english voice acting + japanese stereotypes = usually not a good idea. It's not by chance that "Idiot!" doesn't sound as good as "baka!" at the end of "I didn't do it because I like you, baka!"\n\nIn the first episode, you are introduced to an uncle (Kaito), sister (Nikki), friend (Shou) and the romantic options: Mayu, Yuuna and Kaori. There's also a french girl appearing in the next episode, Belle (Ooh là là). And there's also other guy that you may or may not meet in this episode depending on your choices, Akira (I got my eye on you, you white haired *insert swear here*)\n\nBecause we are only in the first episode, and also because I'm lazy, I will refrain for now from talking of each one individually, but what I can say is that they feel compeling and I want to know more about them.\n\nEnjoyment: 9I am a sucker for choices. I am a sucker for consequences. So I had a blast replaying it multiple times and roleplay differently each time.\nThe only complaint I have is that this episode felt a bit shorter compared with the original demo, but other than that, it was fun.\n\nFinal rating: 8 (episode 1)\nTL;DR:Just buy it!\n\nI kid. You should buy it if:\n- You like light hearted stories;\n- You like mechas;\n- You like tons of choices;\n- You like easter eggs♥♥♥♥♥♥ences;\n- You want to support western VN's.\n\nYou shouldn't buy it if:\n- You want a serious story (again, this is based off of the first episode, it might get serious moments later on for all I know);\n- You don't like any kind of mini games in visual novels;\n- You prefer more linear stories.\n\nIf you have any questions or you want to point out something, feel free to comment. I will reply as soon I notice it.","September 4, 2015","true","16.8"," 41 of 44 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","41","44","0","0"

The story was enticing and kept me very interested in the characters throughout the first part of the game. I also enjoyed little mini games within this visual novel which kept things interesting.\n\nSecondly the music to this game is very good and fits the rhythm of what is happening and the mood that goes with it. I was very surprised at how well it was done for a company’s first work.\n\nFinally all the characters to this game have a lot to them and are all very likeable. This made me enjoy the story so much more and felt more connected with each character. The voice acting is also good and fits the characters all very well giving them all their own great personalities. There are also many different choices you can make which help keep the game fresh and mean there is much more replay ability.\n\nIn all I feel ACE Academy is definitely worth a buy! It’s a lot better than most other visual novels I have played on steam. Especially seeing as the first part is longer than most of them, it is defiantly worth the money! If visual novels are your thing I think you will enjoy it as much or maybe more than I did!\n","September 3, 2015","true","2.0"," 25 of 26 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","25","26","0","3"

I'm going for Kaori :D It was a tough decision between her and Yuuna, sorry all you Yuuna fans.\nWith that intergration of quick time events during the action of the VN and quick second decisions, it keeps you on your toes and puts a creative twist of VNs I haven't seen before making it an enjoyable experience the whole way through.\nI could go on and on but i'll cut it short and say, if you have never played a VN before and see this masterpiece I strongly recommend you buy this one, you will never look back and wonder why you bought it.\nIt is keeping me on edge as I powered through the first 2 episodes in one session and I want more already. 10/10 :D\n","December 27, 2015","true","10.7"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","1"

The game has quite a bit of content now that it includes Episodes 1, 2, and 3. The acting is still very good, and the writing seems to have gotten even better.

However, I have since given up support for the project, through no reason other than the unfortunate issues the development staff encountered at many steps. What was originally intended to come out fully in June of this year, is now still in early access.\n\nHowever, this is to be expected. They have changed the game considerably, and picked up new staff, despite the issues encountered. As a mid-tier backer of the project, I was given early access to builds of the new ‘Ace Academy’ game. All I can say is I found the quality of the writing to be greatly diminished from that of the original demo.\n\nWithout spoiling anything, certain character interactions with a girl named ‘Kaori’. She’s quite temperamental, and I was originally satisfied with how much you were able to tease her. From what I played of the current game, there have been far less options to do this. In general, I found the comedy of the original to be much more prominent.\n\nThere are some improvements over the redo. The art is much better, and I’m sure the futuristic appeal of the game will be more enjoyable to some, over the original Kendo focus, which some might have seen as boring. I must admit, that it was probably a better move for the game to be redesigned, but that doesn’t change my opinion on the matter.\n\nWhile I can guarantee the game is worth the price, it just isn’t there for me.","September 3, 2015","false","8.8"," 51 of 88 people (58%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","58","51","88","6","0"

Story is nice, it goes nice pace, and there is a lot choices. Even if story is 2049, giant mechas etc, story is realistic and heart warming. This is keeping up with If My Heart Had Wings, which I think is best visual novel on Steam so far. I might gives this even more credits, but because Early Access, I don't want to rush, but if story is written as well as first 2 episodes, my god they should nearly make anime or movie about this.\n\nArt is awesome.

However, ACE Academy includes certain features that go a step beyond other games in the genre. The main character can be named, and you can choose a "specialty" for him, such as athletic, intelligent, or charismatic. These affect events in the game. You can also choose which weapons you load on your Mecha (AKA GEAR), which actually affect your GEAR's statistics. These minor features add up to a better experience and a more content-rich game.\n\nThe characters are fun and entertaining. Most of them seem to settle in to standard anime roles, but they may surprise you. On the Romance side of things you have "Tsundere Girl" Kaori, "Nice Girl" Yuuna, "Shy Girl" Mayu, and "Refreshingly Horny Girl" Valerie. They are not one-note characters, and even Kaori's hostility is more than just anger for anger's sake. For the Supporting Cast you have "Best Little Sister Ever" Nikki, "Best Uncle Ever" Kaito, and "Broseph" Shou. Unlike most stories with a Harem setup, ACE Academy's supporting characters are vital to the story and have just as much characterization as the main girls. I see it as one of the game's unique strengths.\n\nThere are currently two chapters in Early Access, and it's a nice amount of content especially with the game's branches and reactivity. If nothing else, it should be more than enough to tell whether you will love the game or not.\n\nI highly recommend ACE Academy. It is actually the first game I even bothered to post a review for. If you are reluctant to enter Early Access on principle, I would still recommend Bookmarking the game so you know when it's released. If you love Visual Novels, Dating Sims, or any kind of game with Choices and Consequences, I believe you'll have a lot of fun.","January 21","true","4.2"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

I think I'll become more interested in visual novels overall." I say up to this point, because this game changed that. I finally see what it is that some people find so enthralling about visual novels. This game made me laugh, worry, plan strategically, get nervous, blush, get frustrated, ponder wholeheartedly, fall in love, think of witty comebacks, and experience a whole heap of other emotions and experiences. It was fantastic. This game is so well written. There's real personality to your possible choices, and there are a plentiful amount of choices for you to make. You really dictate what turns the story takes, and how different characters' storylines develop. Sure, the game is still kind of short and so it's probably not currently worth the full $25 price tag, but that's because the game is still in early access and only halfway completed. I have no doubt that by the time the remaining chapters are added, I will have definitely gotten my money's worth out of this game, and then some. The mini games are fairly basic, but also decently enjoyable. I hope there are a few more matches in the future chapters, but so far the mecha aspect of the game has been done decently well, especially as it ties into the storylines overall. The bottom line is, this is by far the best visual novel I've ever played, and highlights all the great things that this genre of game can be. I absolutely recommend purchasing it.","March 5","true","10.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Definitely enjoyed having some time based choices, definitely brings more uniqueness to the game. Love the character art so far the mecha art leaves a bit to be desired though. The game has some good humor.\n\nAfter playing through the third episode I am thoroughly hooked. I am getting a feel for the story at this point, or at least I thought i was up until the end there. But anyways I am still seeing some great writing but more so the references made in the game that can be related to  modern culture. References to memes and television shows are scattered throughout and bring a very light humor to the visual novel. keep looking foward to the completion because this is going to be one worth replaying over and over, and thats a rare trait.

This is probably one of the best games I have played. Despite it being based into the future, the choices give me options that I personally would say/do, allowing me to feel like I am actually part of the game itself. The fact that it allows you to name your own character and gives you a few choices to customize or alter the character at the beginning is even better.

I'm not entirely sure how much the choices will affect the overall story because only a single episode has been released but there certainly were quite a few and it did seem to change dialogue for later conversations.\n\nThe mech combat is a bit button-mashy and it would have been nice if it had been more skill based instead of being nearly a rhythm match game by using the wasd keys to just move according to enemy attacks when a prompt appears. Its combo system seems a bit broken too. It depends how you finish the attack phase and not your maximum combo, so if you mess up immediately, you're fine but if you get 19 perfect hits and mess up to start a new combo, it'll act like your max combo was 1 which is a bit frustrating and does lead to save scumming.\n\nThe character choices seem a lot of fun and each interaction was pretty different.\n\nTotally need a sister route though, Nikki is definitely one of the funnier characters.","September 18, 2015","true","6.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Like most good things in life though, it isn't finished yet.  I've gone down a couple of routes, and one route in particular seems like it would be painful to read.  Why every developer puts a tsundere in their visual novel is beyond me.  Maybe they think the players want to shut her up by putting toothpaste in her mouth, among other things.  Seriously, that is the only drawback to an otherwise promising start.  C'est la vie.\n\nThere is a fair amount of humor to be had.  As far as a visual novel goes, it is very polished.\n\nThough there are a couple of mini-games, it really does not affect much.  Maybe they intend to fix this in the next release?\n\nOne final warning though, is that writing a review for a heavily-based story element is somewhat premature, since the biggest part of it is yet to be completed.  That said, there is a fair amount of work already done, and what they have looks promising.\n\nWhat I've seen so far is worth it.  I would reccomend it, but as always buyer beware.  Especially with half-finished products.  Unfortunately, half finished projects tend to stay half finished.  If you are one of those people who can put a book down in the middle of an important plot point, by the game.  Otherwise, I'd suggest waiting until the game is completed.","February 22","true","9.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Diverse cast of characters; Cute little sister, Shy girl, flirty foreigner, Tsundere and of course, the idiot male friend.\n2. Diverse focus. Even if you're focusing on one character to get to know them or get romantically involved, at some points you HAVE to talk to someone else and it shows character development for all the characters.\n3. Not just a date sim, just because it has a date sim doesn't mean that's the focus of the story, in fact some of my FAVORITE dialouge is silly banter between Shou, the male friend, and your character.\n4. Character artwork is JUST as good as the character personalities.\n5. Full cast voice acting. We have voice acting  and not just for the main characters like your family and friends, even the faceless background characters like classmates and teachers have voices.\n\nCons:\n1. Again with Artwork, some of the full cut scenes are not necessarily poorly drawn, but they need to be redrawn if nothing else for the sake of functional anatomy.\n2. Voices, some of the voices for the main characters sound... off, not necessarily bad, some just don't fit the characers, and others just sound like they were recorded on a terrible mic. Other than that voices are great.\n3. The "Gears" I am 100% fine with the name, but the mech suits, in my opinion, look very bland and need a little bit of visual flair. There is one acception being somthing that happens to the main character's Gear after a certain point in the game BUT that new look is temporary and I don't want to spoil anything more.\n4. Combat, Quick time events are used throughout the game including quick reaction dialogue and such, but  the combat mechanics are severely lacking. it's just a mater of you have about three to four seconds to press either w,a,s or d as it appears on the screen, you fail to press it in time or press the wrong one, you take damage. As a counter to my arguement, this game is 1) still in early access, and 2) not a fighting sim. I know this, but I feel once the game has a bit more story done to it they should go back and refine the combat system just a little bit that way it's more fun to fight in your big robot.\n\nAgain all of my complaints are either only a problem because the game is early access, or can be fixed in an upcoming update due to the fact it's in early access. Over all for an uncompleted game with a few quirks that may bug me but Certainly don't take much away from the game if at all, I give this game a 9/10. Depending on how they finish it it may jump up to 10/10","December 24, 2015","true","4.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I haven't felt this good about a visual novel since I last binged Princess Evangile, and before then Katawa Shoujo. It may not be a serious visual novel for serious people such as myself (like Kara no Shoujo Episode II), or maybe it is and I'm just not there yet (full disclosure: I run VNs in the background while I perform other tasks, do not take my play time as anything resembling average), but I'm having an absolute blast with the humor and sheer amount of player choices/dialogue paths within the VN. Hell, this is probably one of the few OELVNs that I can give a glowing review to because I'm having such a good time with it - at the same time, it's currently 3 AM and my brain is fried from an intense work day and I need to seriously wind down, so do not take anything I am writing at this moment in time 100% serious. I don't know if I'm still in episode one or diving into episode two, I just got finished with my first date eating AMERICAN BURGERS with Yuuna, and am now watching Netflicks with my uncle and little sister. At this point in time, I can sufficiently say that I am sold on any other visual novel that this team may pursue after Ace Academy - or I may constantly ask for an "Ace Academy Season 2" if the rest of the VN's future episodes keeps up with what I've currently read.\n\nThe only negatives I currently have, which may be fixed within future updates, are as follows:\n-Errors in both spoken and non-spoken text, most likely non-spoken but I've seen several errors with what Voice Actors say and what is written in the text box\n-Some lines are not read, which strikes me as odd since the previous and following lines are most likely voiced by the same character\n-There is no route for best girl Shou, if there is please tell me how to get there thank you in advance","January 24","true","39.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Not only is the artwork gorgeous, but I could not stop staring at the characters every time they popped up on the screen. They're all so well made, and each has a unique personality and backstory that only adds more to the game. One of the key points that I loved about this game was how fun it was to make different choices. The dialogue is hilarious, and the voice acting is so on key, at least to me. I also loved my MC, whom I named Kasiya Arian. I based him and the decisions he made after a roleplay character of mine, and it was so easy to stay true to that! A lot of times it's hard for multi-choice dialogue games to fit to what people want, but I found it so easy to get dialogue choices that fit to what I wanted him to be. I didn't regret a single choice and I had so much fun, it all felt very natural. Even now, I plan on jumping in and starting anew with a new Love Interest and new choices.

Am really disappointed that the protagonist dose not have a character spirt instead they do a first person view rather third person a lot of VN have the protagoinst in first person and when i played Kendo Crush and saw that the protagonist was viewed as a third person i thought that was really cool but when i played Ace Academy and it went with the tradisional first person i was really disappointed in that i played a lot of VN you can say am a veteran VN player  3. For music it fit fine but not it was not that amazing to say 4. For each character personality excluding protagonist there personality was fine there was nothing wrong with them 5. As for character introduction kind of disappointed in that as how the protagonist met with the first heroin it was just too simple depending your choices of course but still it was way too simple for a introduction for example in Ace Acadamy the introduction was spoil alert here ( met on the bus..... really thats how they met just like that) for Kendo Crush the introduction was introduce better example spoil alert ( first met in homeroom but was not considered a introduction as the protagonist did not intract with her he only intract with her after he saved a neko from a tree is you don't know what a neko is is basicly japanese word for cat. I can go on more and more but am not so is this VN recommended yes for those who are new too VNs but for those who are Veteran VN players i have to say i don't recommended it for veteran players but for new VN players its a yes","September 26, 2015","true","1.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","1"

My favorite part about it, I think, is that in structure it's more similar to a choose your own adventure game than it is to most visual novels (that I've played at least). The sheer breadth of choices for simple things is something I really really appreciate. Too often I've been told that "this person is you" but have felt a profound disconnect between their actions and thoughts and my own; not so here. In fact, there was only one point I ever felt like my reaction wasn't amongst the choices and one point where I felt a choice was so VERY correct that I laughed and whooped, both a product of my strange sense of humor. (Small spoilers in the next paragraph)\n\nThe only disconnect occurred when your sister gives your bike a little makeover. I wanted to laugh my ♥♥♥ off, own it, and then proceed to drive that ♥♥♥♥ everywhere. Every time someone made a remark about it, I would proudly proclaim that my sweet little sister wanted to help decorate my bike and I just couldn't say no--she really loves unicorns, can you tell? I would keep doing that until SHE was embarrassed and BEGGED me to let her clean it off. The very correct choice was when asking your Broseph to go to the arcade with the "The time of cyber skirmishing is upon us." choice.\n\nAnyway, the visual novel itself is wonderful and I love all the characters (I still can't choose a best girl). I don't think there were any of them I didn't like. I kept wanting a button to affectionately pat Nikki (the sister) on the head when she was being adorable. The setting itself is really interesting and a welcome departure from the standard faire (and the option to  name your special move was something I adored). I, quite frankly, can't wait for the next chapters, though I'll probably wait until they're all out and the game is 100% done to play again.\n\nI only have two criticisms. The first is that, while I adored all of the memes and little in-jokes, I have to wonder to what extent they're applicable in, y'know, Japan. For example, though I can't be certain as I've never been there, I don't think Japan has stereotypical American fratboys like the kind Shou lives with. It seems to me like the setting would have been better-served with simply having the initial move be one, say, across to the other coast of the United States. I imagine this is simply an artifact from when the visual novel was Kendo Crush and more fully Japanese in setting. Still, this is a minor complaint.\n\nMy big one is stuff like THIS! Look at it! Look at that ♥♥♥♥! And it doesn't end, there are more later! And I can only imagine there will be more still in the future chapters! This is just revolting, insane! These writers just have no respect for the laws of nature or man. They're sick and they need to be put down like the sick dogs that they are. Some men just want to watch the world burn.\n\n(jk ilu <3)","January 31","true","23.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Even if it's early access it's worth the price just because with only two episodes out I think I've started more save files just to see what would happen this time I played. I've set up a save file for pretty much every route for every girl and each one is fun and feels very different than the last.\n\nNot to mention the just amazing effort to make everything you say and do translate to the rest of the game is both impressive and just fun to watch. For example I had missed an event early on for a particular girl I was after because I hadn't done what I was supposed to do to activate it before. Then a later event totally changes it's premise based on that scene and--I could just go on. Needless to say I am dying for episode three but I will spend my time experimenting here and there.\n\nFor other technical notes for those looking for them; the art is really pleasing, every detailed character looks great and they keep up the variety in appearances, I noticed a few stalls here and there mostly when more than one model joins a conversation but it's never too jarring just noticeable. And I can't say anything about the voice acting as I personally am not a fan of voice acting in VN's, it's just a personal choice I prefer to imagine what they sound like, it's just a preferance after being a heavy reader for so long. I've heard good things about the voice cast though so if you like that thing I'm sure you'll be fine. And I guess if I had any con some of the dialogue choices and the replacements used to avoid copyright are... cringe worthy, but also charming so I can't really knock it.\n\nJust buy it, you'll love it I swear, and I await the rest of the episodes as they come out.","February 1","true","21.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You play [your character's name here (he's a boy)], a student moving to futuristic Japan to become a mech pilot at ACE Academy. What's not to love? While the plot is fairly simple, it's actually a very interesting new scenario. I don't remember any colleges that trained Mech Pilots.\n\nBut the game's biggest strength is in the characters who are VERY likeable... and I'm not talking EXCLUSIVELY about the girls.\n\nI really like my character's relationship with his little sister and his uncle. They've got a very believable relationship as a family and the drama regarding your character's past isn't bad either. You're fellow classmates (Yuuna, Shou, Kaori, Mayu and Valerie) are the bread and butter though. You have...\n\nShou, the goofy best friend\nYuuna, the good student\nKaori, the bossy yet easily-flustered team player\n\nI could go on but I won't...\n\nEvery single one of the main characters (or at least one with an actual image instead of a silhouette) is very interesting and I constantly find myself wanting to get closer to them and see where I can go with their relationships whether platonic or romantic. That's a REALLY impressive and realistic approach to a Visual Novel RPG.\n\nIt also has a LOT of cultural references and parodies that actually made me laugh out loud. Dragon Ball Z, Simone Cuwell (was that the name? I can't remember), Tommy Tutone and lots of others. I don't know why but I find them very amusing.\n\nThe biggest flaw with the game, in my opinion, is ironically one of it's most defining features: the Mech battles. All there is to it is quick time events where you press W, A, S or D when the key shows up. It's undeniably boring with little effort put into the project. When I think of fights in an RPG, I usually think of something like MechQuest or Loren the Amazon Princess; a turn-based fighting game with strategy and basic RPG elements. As far as I'm concerned, you can't customize you're Mech's appearance or it's weapons. While you CAN equip you're robots primary weapons (mine being the twin SMGs and Buster Sword), it doesn't make a difference at all in the arena battles. So far, the Mech battles have been a GIGANTIC wasted opportunity.\n\nHowever, with that aside, this is a GREAT game! You feel really connected to the characters and their interactions can be as cute as some are funny. If you're looking for an interesting Visual Novel with likeable characters, this is your game! If you're looking for a badass Mech suit battle RPG, try Mech quest.\n\nFinal Verdict: 8.75/10 (It would've been a 10 if it had better elements regarding the Mech battles)","April 17","true","16.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Next thing you should know is that I am incredibly picky with what VNs I even consider reading. Now that that is out of the way, to the review itself.\n\nThis VN is an incredibly quirky and funny story about a guy who ends up moving to Japan, for reasons that are hinted at in the story (As of the time of this review, only episode 2 has been released). The charecters that you are to interact with throughtout the game are at first glance set into one troupe or onother, but quickly begin to get depth to them. The amount of dialogue options in the game give it a very personal and individual experience, something many other VNs in the industry lack, stacked on top of being able to name the main charecter and give him a strength allow for one of the best experiences I have had to date.\n\nThe actual layout, structure, and the pacing of the game are all very well thought out. Nothing feels rushed, events don't just happen out of the blue, and it has a very authentic atmosphere. All in all, I consider this one of the games I am looking forward to the most in the coming year. If you are someone who has an interest in NVs but has always been scared away, I have confidance that this is one of the best games to get into the industry. I personally started with Fate Stay Night, and have no qualms about putting the this game right there with it. This was worth every penny, and is looking to be one of the best VNs I have had the plessure of reading. 10/10","February 13","true","9.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I like to say it was a good investment for Ace Academy held my attention by the end of the demo.\n\nRarely do you get a fully english Visual Novel, and it feels a bit more interesting to me than a regular japanese subbed one. It probably helps that all the characters are well voiced and that you can hear how well they suit their characters. Like Shou Shinjirou, the male best friend. If I didn't know better, I'd say he sounded like Yuri Lowenthall (particularly Yosuke from Persona 4). And it feels fun to hang out with him despite the obvious dating sim with other girls, if only because he seems to have his own romance subplot that you can either help out in or watch from the distance as he remains oblivious.\n\nIn fact, the whole slice-of-life story is quite enjoyable with all the characters. You have the cute but at times annoying younger sister, the laid back uncle, and the kind and popular ace Ace pilot. And then you have a bunch of girls that you can date; there's the mean captain with a soft side, a smart and shy support with an obvious crush on Shou, the shameless flirt of an engineer, a kind stickler to the rules manager, and possibly a friendly rival to the captain but with bad history. As vague as those descriptions are, that's the gist of the cast.\n\nIt's actually hard for me to pick which one girl to follow at first, because they're all likeable in their own way. They have layers to them that only through extended hang-out sessions can you see and also realize in how to nurture your friendship with them. Of course, I might have cheated because there's a "rollback" system, or at least being able to load to an earlier save or autosave file before picking a different option.\n\nAnd the music is top notch. The instrumental version of the trailer song as you load it up is very catchy and seems to capture the general feel of the game. Upbeat and awesome.\n\nOf course, I wish the game would make some changes for the full release. While the slice-of-life aspects are fun, I have little to no understanding of the world lore, despite the little sprinkled in class scenes talking about Gears. Gears are a big deal in the world; there are even movies and TV shows that are like ours but have the world Gear in them; That 70's Gear, The Gear of Thrones, The Lord of the Gears...\n\nWe hear so much about Gears on a technical scale from their tools to their weapons, including the safe "recreational" ones. And yet at the same time don't know a thing. They're a common thing in this world, have their own toy line, and yet there doesn't seem to be any sort of big scale robot war with them. Why do college students have to fight each other? Why are there sponsors for so many pilot teams? What's the benefit of being a Gear Pilot? What do Gear Pilots do when they graduate? It's not like we have Gears of our own in our world so it would help to get some context. It can't be exactly as the same as running tanks or planes because we don't use those to beat the snot out of each other.\n\nAnd what's more, I like to agree with the general consensus that the fast reaction time keys of WASD is kind of bland for what I'd expect in a visual novel with actual gameplay. For the first few matches I wasn't even sure if I was doing something right because there were two points where the gameplay elements screwed with you; first was when you had no weapons and could only dodge and block as your HP dwindled down and your enemy was completely fine (not to mention you couldn't even choose the action; it was automatic after pressing the button indicated). Then there was a match where you DID have weapons, but you got your scrap ♥♥♥ kicked anyway because the weapons weren't calibrated. I thought it was another mistake based on the weapons I could choose (and you only get to choose once in this Early Access, between three sets of guns and three sets of swords).\n\nThey were all story-based defeats that meant to drive the plot a bit more, but I thought I was actually doing something wrong. There was little to no explanation in how to fight other that "use the weapons at the right time". But you don't get to chose to go all sword akimbo because the 4 button commands change it every time. You have no control of your protagonist's Gear so it feels less like a cool robot fight and more like a game of slap the coin before your opponent does.\n\nMy suggestion is that if there is going to be fighting that incorporates the swords, guns, thrusters and shields, let the player make their own choices. Make into rock-paper-scissors, kind of like Fate/EXTRA. There are four buttons, so each one can make a command. Gun beats Sword, Sword beats Thrusters, and Thrusters beats Gun, with the Shield command as an all purpose guard. You still take damage, but not as much as if you got hit with the wrong counter.\n\nStill, I was hooked until the end of the 3rd Episode; where it literally ended on a rather tense cliffhanger. Up until then, there wasn't any sense of drama or tension aside from school related problems, and most of those were easily resolved in time. But I think after all the build-up and introduction that there might be a change in the story, as well as an answer to most of the question I listed here.\n\nAce Academy is a very fun game. I would have kept playing until the end and/or got bored if possible. I'm not sure if I can recommend this to anyone, but I certainly enjoyed running at least 5 and a half hours in it. It sounds short, but with a lot of choices to build your camaraderie and possible love interest, as well as some hidden choices depending if you picked a strong, smart, or charasmatic build when you start the game, it has the potential to go on even longer by the time it goes full access. I personally can't wait to play more of this game/","May 2","true","5.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I really enjoy how the developer handles character development and how they introduces them. Each are unique and have their own memorable traits.\n\nIn terms of other VN, it is definitely not a kinetic one since most choices leads to new scenes that can leave readers sitting for hours making multiple saves at every choices. What I enjoyed most is the interactive battle scene, although simple, it can reinvigorate readers from the norm reading(unless you're an avid reader and don't mind texts).\n\nThe OST, although simple, gives the perfect vibe for every scene it plays, giving the readers a lucid experience on the scene occuring. A few of the soundtrack does catches my attention, especially during the battle scene where it kept my me on my toe and few touching scene that helps me indulge the background storyline.\n\nIn terms of art, it is an eye candy and easily score 8/10. I hoped that there will be more gallery pictures featuring the characters doing their pastimes or just hanging out.\n\nI have played few VN, and I won't say I'm an expert. Hell, I played a lot but only finishes about 2 to 3 VN. Just because I don't know cooking, doesn't mean that  I can't say one's a good cook. I would definitely recommend fellow readers to take a moment to consider if you wanted a simple but rich story, then you have come to the right place.","May 3","true","9.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I did enjoy the start, up until the 3rd choice that you have in the story, “WTF” being one of the options kind of put me off a bit and it took me out of the story. It caught me really off guard in a bad way; I was beginning to feel like I might have waited the money for this game. A good amount the abbreviations for your choices put me off, and some just not giving me a good idea of what I thought they would say. Some of them seemed a little childish at times, the wording of the choices or how it was in all caps, I felt like if I would have chosen them your player character would have acted just….like a child? Like for instance “AT LEAST YOU HAVE A MOM” Is not quality writing for a option to choice from.\n\nBut later on in the story at one point with the Player characters sister, I got a little emotional and somewhat adapted to the way the choices where written, I was still a little put off by some of them, but not as much early on, overall, I started to really enjoy it and I was glad that I kept playing when I wanted to stop.\n","May 4","true","13.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I feel like this game deserves better.\nACE Accademy is a Slice of Life / Romance / Giant robot fighting Visual Novel (A game in which the primary aspect of Gameplay is dialogue). If you watch Anime you'll feel right at home. However, You don't have to love VNs or Anime to enjoy this. It's a wonderful game all on its own.\nThe basic plots is this: Your character and your (adorable) little sister move to Japan to live with your (awesome) Uncle. You've transfered into ACE Accademy, a school that teaches people to work with GEARS. Giant robot suits that we fight for sport. You join a team consisting of a great cast of characters, your romance options and a loveable goof. Not all of them are introduced right off the bat but your choices are: A shy girl, A nice girl, A flirty girl, and a... quick tempered girl. They aren't that simple though, each character is deep and very interesting, with their own quirks and flaws.\nThe romance is very well done, quite adorable, and a huge draw for me. However, if that's not your thing, this game still has content for you. The main content is just as well made as the romance subplots.\nThe game is full of funny moments and interesting character development. It also has a lot of pop culture references, which while entertaining, we'll have to see how well they age. Even if they don't age well though, this will still be a great game.\nThe game has a bit of exta gameplay in the form of combat which they described as trying to be "DDR like", but they've recently stated that they're going to redesign combat in general.\nThis brings me to my penultimate point: The game is still under development, so the end isn't known yet. But I have high hopes for it. Parts are going to change, and I don't know what E4 will look like, but everything up till now has been incredible.\nFinally I'd like to say that this game has become my new go to VN to recommend to people who want to try out the genere. It's easily accesable, funny, fun, mixes things up a little, has a great cast, great art, basically it's over all a great starting point.","April 23","true","19.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Lets get on with the pros and cons\nPros\nRealisitic- This game actually gave me decisions that I would of said the exact same thing in which was kind of freaky.\nComedy- I had many good laughs with all the characters as well as when you, your uncle Kaito and Niki decide to watch a movie they all have hints towards the tv shows they mimic.\nVoicing- I love that there is full english voice acting for the most part with the non-playable characters except for maybe a single line I noticed that wasn't voiced.\nCharacters- All the characters are interesting and their is even two characters who have feelings for someone other than the MC I know this is a rare occurence in Visual Novels.\nFree Choices- For the most part you always have multiple decisions and there is replay ability.Cons\nIncomplete- This shouyld get resolved since the game is in Early Access.\nMinor Grammar Issues- I'm no grammar whiz ,but I noticed a few weird sentences.Summary\nOverall, I love this game and I have high hopes for it ,but I need episode 4 to come so I can continue to pursue Valerie as the best girl XD\n","May 25","true","17.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There\'s so many storylines, I\'m not sure if any of it weighs on future outcomes, but it appears to have some impact in certain situations.\n\nThe english dialogue is amazing & appreciated edition to the genre.  I don\'t see this option barely ever so I\'m extactic they chose this route.  The voices/tones/attitudes of the characters give them a lot of individuality & attaches you to your favorite characters.  The character story depth is fun to follow and with the variety that will make you wonder what you missed out on.\n\nThe game adds a nice twist to choices based on your character type & some other twists to test your agility & memory.  The music is definitely fun and sets the tone for the situations.  Art is great.  There\'s so much I may have missed something but if you like this genre worth a buy.  I\'m not through the story, but I\'d love to see more like this one.","May 31","true","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
