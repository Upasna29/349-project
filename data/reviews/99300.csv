"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sax_90/recommended/99300/","sax_90","Sax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sax_90/","190 products in account","TL;DR: Proceed to summary.\n\nGameplay:I would describe this game as an arcady shoot'em up.\nIn a top-downish view you control a vehicle freely in a set area and shoot the hell out of your enemies while crashing through buildings. You obtain objectives to progress and occasionally sidequests. If you take too long, ignoring the main objective, the game starts a 3 minutes countdown. No need to become desperate as in my experience no mission takes more than 2 minutes.\n\nKilled enemies may drop pick-ups. Those are health / big health / machine gun upgrade (maxed with 2nd pick-up) / secondary weapon: railgun (my prefered), rocket launcher, flame thrower / ammo for secondary weapons / key cards (mission related). Pick-ups grant bonus points if your health/ammo is full, your machine gun is maxed or you already possess the same secondary weapon.\n\nHarder foes are introduced through progress in the campaign. You need different approaches to beat them. It ranges from kill before they fire to circling around them. It also depends on which character you have chosen as the special abilities differ much.\n\nIf you die you lose any picked up upgrade. If not ending up on the wheels, the game resets your car and you won't lose anything. If you get stuck somewhere or sink in water, you will respawn, again without loss. The game has no checkpoints. Losing the last life requires to rebegin that level, nonetheless any earned XP gets accounted.\n\nThere are 9 levels and 5 different characters/vehicles you may choose from (excluding DLC, see below). Every car has another special ability which can change the playstyle a lot. Points you earn while playing are also accounted as XP towards your chosen character. By leveling up you earn upgrade points and unlock additional perk slots. You can use those points to unlock perks from 3 single-pathed skill trees: Offensive, Defensive, Tactic. Off and Def are the same for all, only their order varies. Tactic perks boost your special ability. Reaching max level every perk is unlocked.\n\nDifficulty settings:Casual: Infinite lives, reduced score, no leveling, no upgrades, no damage streaks.\nNormal: 5 lives.\nHardcore: 3 lives, increased score.(Side note: I only played on hardcore.)\nIt took me the first 2-3 levels to get used to the game and achieving consistently good results. It still was a challenge though. The final level is a bit tedious because it is a very long path featuring many challenges (even a few jump&run elements) until you reach the final boss.\n\nControls:You can view them in the main menu and while pausing the game. Unfortunately you can't remap them. Even though the game recommends a controller, I had no problems playing on keyboard & mouse. You move around with [W], [A], [S], [D]. Press [SHIFT] to drive faster in return you won't be able to fire. [CTRL] activates the handbrake so that your car won't roll by itself (down a ramp). Use [SPACE] for the special ability and [E] to switch secondary weapon (giving up the current one). Tap [TAB] to show a semi-hollow map which will be displayed in the center of your screen. It shows the locations of your current mission.\n\nThe mouse is used to move a reticle on your screen. It marks the spot you will shoot at. [Left Mouse Button] fires machineguns. [Right Mouse Button] fires secondary weapon. If you target something above (e.g. helicopter) or below (e.g. down a ramp) you, the game adapts automatically.\n\nThe default movement emulates a d-pad, giving 8 possible directions. I recommend to enable "Tank Steering" as it allows you to move freely. [W] being forwards, [S] backwards, [A] for steering left, [D] steering right. Keep in mind that "Tank Steering" won't apply to the helicopter which is no problem as you won't encounter many obstacles in the air.\n\nStory:The story is straightforward and foreseeable, nontheless it's good enough to attract your attention and wanting you to learn more. As the store page already states, the main plot line is "In Renegade Ops you must defeat Inferno, a madman intent on global domination." The characters you can choose from are part of the Renegades which are under general Bryant's command. They fight Inferno, his minions and maybe even more... The cutscenes are presented in comic style. When the story/mission goes on while playing the game displays a single panel at the top right, not disturbing your view. Subtitles are fit in the pictures and don't break the comic art style.\n\nGraphics:Available settings are resolutions, anti-aliasing (none, x2, x4) and v-sync (none, 60).\nThe game ran smooth on my machine and I never encountered lag or drops in framerate.\nSettings: 1920x1080, AAx4, no v-sync.\nSpecs: Intel Core i7-4702MQ 2.2GHz, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 850M, 8 GB DDR3.\n\nThe game is nice to look at while cruising through the well designed areas. The levels vary and you will encounter different environments and textures. Water and most important fire effects are an eyecandy. The explosions are a blast and even though most entities are quite small, they are detailed.\n\nSound:You won't really pay attention at the music except for the intro/menu/cutscenes as your concentration focuses on the action and the sound effects will predominate. As far as I was able to listen to it, it fitted well. Outside of fights it keeps subtle and turns more intense while fighting, adding the feeling of action. As everything is about firing and explosions the sound effects are a blast. The audio never annoyed me in except for one thing: Driving at max speed keeps looping the sound of the car, including shifting etc.\n\nMultiplayer:You won't find someone randomly. You need to organise sessions with Steam friends.\nThe leaderboards are occupied by cheaters (as almost everywhere). It seems that no dev cares about.\n\nReplayability:Each car needs a different playstyle and you might want to experience all of them, especially if you plan to reach max level with all. Additionally a few achievements aren't story/progress related. Finally there is the multiplayer mode when you have someone to play with.\n\nBugs & other issues:My game crashed 3 times in total while playing. I encountered the infamous "AVA_Main has stopped working" error. In my case ut popped up randomly. I was able to complete the game and its achievements.\n\nThe special ability bar is located at the bottom left of your screen, way out of your focus. You will be hit if you want to check it.\n\nDLCs:Coldstrike Campaign:\nThe story continues and puts you in snowy, icy regions. It offers 3 levels, the last one being the most difficult. That final level features (again) a long road until you reach the boss. At 2 different spots you could call it unfair or cheap. 4 new achievements, 3 for completing the levels, 1 for easter egg.\nReinforcement Pack:\nFeatures 2 new renegades/characters/vehicles.\n\nSummary:+Gameplay fun & enjoyable\n+Casual-friendly difficulty with infinite lives\n+Challenging & fair hardcore difficulty\n+Accessible keyboard & mouse controls\n+Story attracts attention\n+Smooth graphics, little eye candy\n+Fitting sounds are literally (a) blast/s.\n+Replayability through levels, different cars & achievements\n+Featuring Gordon Freeman, HL3 confirmed!\n\n-Superficial & straightforward story\n-Multiplayer is dead (friends needed)\n-Leaderboards aren't cleansed from cheaters\n-"AVA_Main has stopped working" error\n-Car sound shifting infinitely\n\nGood game.\n16,99€ (Bundle with DLCs) is a good price.\n\n7/10","October 18, 2015","true","15.9"," 50 of 53 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","50","53","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/99300/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Renegade Ops runs on a philosophy of being badass above all else!\n\nIt marries the movement and speed of an isometric racing game with the endless explosions of a twinstick shooter, firmly aware of its shallowness and playing it up to great effect. The over the top story of a team of ex-military personnel gone rogue when the government couldn't make the call to action is outrageous and thoroughly entertaining, existing as a conduit for one liners and to shuffle around a bunch of musclebound dudes and gals (major kudos for having as many awesome female characters as bros, and letting them keep their clothes on to boot) with the sole intention of blowing up anything everything in their path.\n\nWith how much is going on at any given time, be it the constant barrage of bullets, endless explosions, crumbling buildings and who knows what else, it's so overwhelmingly bombastic and fun that it's easy to overlook how repetitive the levels and enemies become by the end. This definitely has a lot to do with the fantastic coop, as although blowing crap up solo is all well and good, it's nothing like the raw insanity of grabbing a friend or two along for the ride. Sure, I might have seen that texture a good several hundred times already, and I swear I already blew that tank up, but there's no time to think about that because they're back again and I'm not nearly sick of watching them go boom yet!\n\nThe only thing standing in the way of you and some friends wreaking all sorts of mayhem is the obtrusive and entirely unnecessary life system, which gives you a finite number of lives to complete a mission and should you die you're out for good. I get that the developer was going for an arcade feel, but there was never an instance when this restriction ever added to the game, only ever serving as an disheartening moment of realization as my coop partner got knocked out for the rest of the mission and was left to watch from the sidelines as I attempted to clean things up.\n\nRenegade Ops is at its core a pretty dumb game, and it knows this, but it's also an extremely enjoyable sort of stupidity that only ever asks that you come along for the ride, switch your mind off and hold down the trigger. That might have gotten grating after a few more hours, but the time I spent with Renegade Ops was nothing if not a continual series of ridiculous action movie moments that didn't care about being smart because it was having as much fun with itself as I was.","January 1, 2015","true","6.9"," 27 of 30 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","27","30","4","1"

For the type of game, the physics of the vehicle is made very well and besides shoot must be careful to "drive" as well as possible in order to best avoid the enemy's shots.\nEverything is rich in details, the attention to detail is obsessive and makes the game a delight for the eyes, especially if carried at maximum graphics options and full-hd.\nBut what makes the game great is the wonderful experience to play online in 4 co-op. You must try, because it is just great!\nRecommended for sessions on the hard difficulty setting.\nI really appreciated the character of Gordon (Half Life 2) and his antlions tricks.\n\nTo note that, unfortunately, the game does not have achievements for online play.\n\nI would absolutely recommend it to everyone, because it really deserves to be in your library. Can give you many hours of fun! :))\n\n\n8/10","July 12, 2014","true","31.9"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","23","25","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/headoncollision/recommended/99300/","headoncollision","Headon.Collision","http://steamcommunity.com/id/headoncollision/","172 products in account","Top down game Like no other.I would say that renegades ops is one of those games that come once in a very long while and go unoticed, I remember purchasing it with a bundle with other games and never played it, until one day I was really bored and starting checking the games that I havn`t played, and so I clicked on it and was .......... pretty impressed!.\nwith it`s cartoonish simple catchy story line to the amount of details and physics in the cars and combat, everything is well done and goes along together well.\n✪ graphics:-\nwell the game look good, and decent, using direct x10 technologies, the vechicles and enviorment are very detailed and the shooting and exploding effect are great, there is nothing to complaint about, any low to mid range gaming pc would be able to handle the game with no hassle.\n\n✪ gameplay:- now here is where a game like this shines, the game suppports 60fps and resolutions up to or even higher than 1440p, the mechanics of the game are smooth and natural, driving the car around is pleasant and doesn`t feel weird, the gameplay is fast paced and keeps you on your toes, so u have to keep moving and shooting no matter what car you are driving. overall your gonna be addicted to it for a while especially if you playing with someone else. ( get to theat in a min)\n\n✪ storyline and progress:- I won`t spoil for you guys so I am just gonna say that the story is catchy and kinda fun to follow, your the hero fighting the bad guy straigh forward.\nyou get 5 charecters to choose from, each with a different car, it`s all about the cars not the one driving them so each car has a special ability to use, so no matter what you choose you are always left with strengths and weaknesses.\nyou have upgrades you can buy with points you earn along the game, upgrades slots are divided to 4 with each slot is dedicated to a certain strength, one of those slot is your special power, which is you want to keep upgrading to get powerful. and trust me you will have to finish the game more than once to fully upgrade your charecters.\n\n✪ multiplayer :- now here is the fun part, this game has full controller support and also keyboard and mouse support, in both you u get to play really easily, but if you have 2 controllers then you can play locally, there is something called dynamic camera view (I think ) which means that if you and your buddy are playing locally with your pc 2 controllers, if you both of your cars are close to each other like in the same area then you both get to be in the same screen blazing, but if you buddy decided to wonder off and go do a side mission then the screen splits but not the typical way but it splits dynamically depending on where your friend is, this way you will always know his direction and can randevo easily.\nthis is for the local multiplayer you can also play online with up to 4 player which is really fun cuz it`s bug free and it has neat features such as comparing your score and spliting each groud to go do a mission so its great.\n\n✪ value $$$ :- currently the game retails for 15$ and 30$ if you buy the 4 pack, I would say the 4 pack is a very good value since the game is more fun playing with others online but for 15$ I would say it`s priced reasonably and good, so you won`t be ripped off either way, if you feel this price is high then watch for bundles or game discounts since this game go into discount but not so often.\n\n- so what I like about this game:-\n✔ no learning curve, easy to play and master.\n✔ nice graphics, light on your rig.\n✔ highly replayablilty.\n✔ realistic physics and effects.\n✔ awesome mutliplayer features, local or online.\n✔ full controller support or mouse and keyboard.\n\nwhat I don`t like about this game.\n\n✘ cannot use keyboard and mouse in local multiplayer, only 2 controllers.\n✘ the game should have featured more missions\n✘ does not support windows xp, only supports direct x10\n\nI would highly recommend this game for anyone who is looking for a top down game that is well implented and fun, there are even a DLC that expand the campaign and adds 2 more charecters it`s worth looking at but the campaign extension is very short.","November 4, 2014","true","54.8"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","20","22","0","4"

Renegade Ops takes the old classic, then moves them to a modern level with co-op, persistent character and tremendous graphics. The camera angle is familiar with a style of zooming around a large map in a distinctive style to Desert Strike, but a little more intense.\n\nThe campaign has an interesting climax to it with a dry sense of clichéd humour and cheesy one-liners as you complete primary and secondary objectives. As you play, it is liberating and anger relieving to blow-up tanks and cars, run yourself through building, and turn infantry units into road-kill.\n\nRenegade Ops offers various ways of controlling your car through a game-pad or keyboard, whatever suits your style of gaming. Overall, it’s a great example of a really enjoyable game based on a simple idea that is executed with care and attention to detail.\n\nAltogether, a great single player and co-op game you can play with your friends.","February 14","true","51.4"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","19","22","2","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/crushnaut/recommended/99300/","crushnaut","Crushnaut","http://steamcommunity.com/id/crushnaut/","59 products in account","Firstly, the context of my experience with this game. I bought the four pack for myself and some friends. My first playthrough was with one buddy and we played through all nine missions over two nights on the medium difficulty without much trouble. Next we will do the hardest difficulty and we will try the DLC which we immediately bought after our first playthrough. Eventually I will get two more friends on for this game and probably play through on solo as well.\n\nSecondly, the positives. This game is simple fun. The basics of the game are: an arrow points towards your mission objective, you follow the direction the arrow is pointing and blow ♥♥♥♥ up along the way. The mechanics of the game make it easy to play so you can enjoy the action and focusing on not getting killed.\n\nThe story and cutscenes are hilarious and enjoyable. Never once did I find myself saying, "Oh no another cutscene." Infact it was the opposite. I truly enjoyed every single one. Bryant is a badass. The ending to this game is, in one word, AMAZING. Best ending ever? Probably.\n\nThirdly, some comments in general. At first I had some issues with the controls. The default controls are set up such that W moves you towards the top of the screen, S towards the bottom, A to the left, and D to the right. This is really counter intuitive. Luckily there is an easy way to change this. Simply turn on tank steering in the options. Once that option is enabled W moves you forward, S backwards, A turns to the left, and D turns to the right.\n\nSome have criticized the mission timers that appear occasionally when you are playing. I am unsure why they find these unenjoyable. Firstly, through my entire first play through I think I saw a timer maybe 6 times. This game isn't about exploration. It is about fast-paced action. You get more points for doing more damage in a short period of time. You always want to be moving forwards to the next objective. Not to mention the fact that the timer isn't arbitrary. It is usually tied directly to a mission objective. IE Destroy the tanks before they reach the town. The timer was never a challenge for me, it was more of a reminder to get the primary mission done.\n\nFinally, the negatives. I found the game quite easy. Dying wasn't really a punishment as you just respawn a short distance from where you died and lose some of your power ups which you can quickly reclaim. During my entire first playthrough I did not get a game over once and did not struggle at all to do things within the time limit. The game being easy had the benefit of allowing me to just enjoy the action and story of the game. In short it was a nice casual playthrough. I hope the hardest difficulty puts up a good fight.\n\nAlso, I would say the game is too short. I am not saying the game is not worth the money, far from it. I got my moneys worth out of this game. I just wish there was more. I wish there was more DLC and more missions. I wish this game wasn't over so fast. I wish there was more story and more Bryant. I would follow that guy into hell and back.\n\nSo that is my review of the game. I hope you find this helpful.\n\nTL:DR;\n\nFast-paced arcade style blow ♥♥♥♥ up game\n+ Awesome Story, Great Action, Great Gameplay\n- Too Easy? Short\n\nTurn on Tank Steering if you plan to play with keyboard.","November 29, 2013","true","7.7"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","17","20","0","0"

It's definitely in between. I would recommend doing some homework before you consider buying it (especially at full price). If I were younger (pre-teens to teens) I would most likely be all over this game. The redundancy of simply running here, getting civilians then blowing this up can really turn a gamer off. Some gamers however, do like games where you simply make things go boom. The gameplay is actually quite decent and may pull some players in. I know the local co-op will definitely raise a few eyebrows.\n\nThe game follows a top-down format in which you drive a car. The gameplay overall isn't that bad. The left stick drives the car while the right stick shoots (shooting in the direction you are pointing). Different cars have differing abilities. Gordon Freeman (from Half-Life) is a feature character on the steam version and his ability is to dispatch 3 headcrabs which attack enemies. Roxy has the ability to deploy airstrikes which is quite effective. Armand has the ability to use shields (yay how exciting to play defense). Diz is able to literally shut down enemies with her EMP ability. Gunnar has the ability to use a heavy cannon that deals a good amount of damage (however he cannot move while using this ability). Gunnar is pretty cool but so far Roxy and Gordon and the most fun to play with (in my opinion of course)! On top of having these abilities, players are able to boost with A. This is a nice addition as going from one side of the map to another to pick up civilians or to make a time limit can be tough without this ability. The game likes to deploy weapon drops that add an additional weapon to your arsenal. Some of these weapons include a flame thrower or a limited amount of rockets that deal a decent amount of damage.\n\nIn addition to basic abilities given to characters, there is an RPG element to the game. Players can choose from three categories to upgrade their specific character : defense, offense and tactical. Each character has slightly different upgrades. In general, defense deals with upgrades such as spare parts (that spawn health pickups when your hit) or doubling up on nitro for a quick get away. In general for offense, some upgrades include starting off with consumable weapons (such as rockets or rail guns), auto-reload or ammo surplus. In general for tactical, cool-downs for specials can be reduced, things like ram-plates can be added as well as counter-shots. You need to cause some mayhem to get some ability points!\n\nMissions generally consist of either defending or attacking certain targets while attempting to extract civilians. It's almost impossible to go off course unless they give you a secret path to follow. Some missions will have you get into a helicopter and start attacking from the air. I think it's really cool that the game attempted to mix things up a bit and give the player a different sense of control. The problem here for me is some of this becomes redundant and is a complete deterrence for my friends and I to continue playing. I'm glad they at least added the ability to drive into houses and knock them down. Adds a little more to the atmosphere.\n\nThe visuals are pretty decent. Nothing less than ordinary or extra-ordinary. The helicopter graphics I feel could have been a lot better. The sounds are decent as well and do not go over and above. The dialogue is okay but can get corny at times.\n\nOverall, it's not a bad game. I have tolerance for a lot of games but most friends I have played local with neither dislike or like the game. More dislike than like the game. I will recommend it but with a big "BEWARE" sign.\n\n\nRATING : 6.75/10\n\n\nScreenShots :\nWhat a boss can look like\n\nUsing an air strike\n\nAnother special being used\n\nYou can get some air in this game","March 30","true","2.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","2"

In essence, there is, but Renegade Ops does everything right in this genre that it's placed in a league of its own, on its own.  It's so fun to play it demands a sequel.  You can also play as Gordon driving that rust bucket dune buggy and summoning loyal aggresive ant lions that are so poorly scripted they get stuck behind a tree, a house, or a ramp.  Then you will realize it was done on purpose and you're better off selecting one of the main Renegade Ops characters, because they're really bad@ss, and not lucky smart nerds.  And Bryant is one funny character.   Here's an example:  Damsel in distress says, "We'll have to sneak in."  Bryant chuckles, and replies, "Sneaking is not even in the manual.  You know what to do, Renegades."  BOOM!   I replay that level just to hear that.","March 31, 2015","true","24.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Something about that top down view controlling a jeep, resucing soldiers, and blowing up everything a crazed madman could throw at you was just perfect for 10 year old me.  I even rented the game 5+ times from the local video store until I saw it for $7 in a pawnshop and had my tiny mind blown that so much awesome could be had for a few weeks worth of lawn mowing money.\n\nI like to think of Renegade Ops as the spiritual successor to Jackal.  The visuals are beautiful, and the way that bad guys explode is top notch.  I don't have a beefy PC by any means, but no matter the number of explosions and guys on my screen, the game never seemed to slow down and allowed the chaos to continue unabated.  In my opinion, the default controls using an xBox 360 controller are darn near perfect.  My one gripe with the game is sometimes I seemed to get stuck in a corner for a bit, but that happened only a handful of times and I was always able to wriggle out.\n\nThe story is basically a mid-80s action movie and very over the top.  But, it is over the top in a way that works and has a very solid action comic-book feel.\n\nPlay this game!

You take control of one of 5 vehicles with an all-direction machine gun and basically roll around blasting every damn thing you see into a dazzling explosion.  A lot of the game is about racking up high scores, allowing for a little competitive gameplay with your friends list, but also offers online multiplayer to allow co-op play as well.  The story has 9 levels and takes about 5 hours to complete, but some will find replay value in the co-op and the ability to level the other characters as well.  It obviously can get a bit repetitive and frustrating to those who lack the hand-eye coordination to drive a car smoothly and fire a directional machine gun, but if you're looking for a fun, arcade-like challenge, you'll find this one well worth the $15 price tag.

Renegade Ops takes the old classic, then moves them to a modern level with co-op, persistent character and tremendous graphics. The camera angle is familiar with a style of zooming around a large map in a distinctive style to Desert Strike, but a little more intense.\n\nThe campaign has an interesting climax to it with a dry sense of clichéd humour and cheesy one-liners as you complete primary and secondary objectives. As you play, it is liberating and anger relieving to blow-up tanks and cars, run yourself through building, and turn infantry units into road-kill.\n\nRenegade Ops offers various ways of controlling your car through a game-pad or keyboard, whatever suits your style of gaming. Overall, it’s a great example of a really enjoyable game based on a simple idea that is executed with care and attention to detail.\n\nAltogether, a great single player and co-op game you can play with your friends.","May 18, 2014","true","6.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

You should definitely use a controller for this game instead of keyboard & mouse.\n\nYou play one of the Renegades, a kind of special ops team under the command of General Bryant who is trying to stop the evil Inferno from launching missiles at innocent people and generally causing chaos. The story is told in motion comic style, and the dialogue is like an 80’s action movie with everyone trying to act/talk macho, but it’s fun and frames the gameplay well.\n\nYou get to choose from about 7-8 different characters, each with their own “special move” such as temporary invulnerability, heavy firepower, or airstrike. The specials are on a cooldown timer so you can’t spam them but they’re definitely must haves for some of the tougher enemies. Each character levels up independently, and while leveling up doesn’t increase your stats, you get skill points that you can use to buy passive upgrades (such as faster cooldown or better armor). Other than the special moves, the characters are generally the same and all use the same machine gun + whatever secondary weapon you find during the level.\n\nSomething to note (and it’s actually really annoying) is that even though the game is played in top down perspective, you can very easily flip your car as you’re driving around. Seriously it’s like driving a Halo warthog while viewing from the top and constantly flipping or hitting things that you don’t see very clearly. The end result is that the vehicle is much more difficult to control than it seems and if you’re playing with a keyboard & mouse you will get frustrated very fast (especially when you’re flipped on your back and a dozen guys are shooting at you).\n\nPros:\n+Very nice graphics and huge maps full of enemies.\n+Fun cheesy story with a “MUHAHAHA” type villain.\n+Co-op multiplayer is available\n\nCons:\n-The car controls can be very annoying since a lot of the areas are very close quarters (such as driving through canyons or villages).\n-For someone like me who is not used to shoot’em up or bullet hell games, Renegade Ops is rather difficult. You have a limited number of lives for each mission, after which you need to start over. You can grind for levels by replaying missions, but like I said earlier your stats don’t increase, so the game doesn’t really get “easier” even if you’re max level.\n\nOverall it’s a fun game, and if you like a challenge you should definitely give it a try.\n","April 21","true","11.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

You drive a vehicle around with one controller stick and aim auto attack fire with the other. Add rocket launchers / rail guns / flame throwers and vehicle boost to the mix and you feel like one of those characters from the expendables going gungho-trigger-happy against the baddies.\n\nPros:\n\n- Beautifully drawn environments. OMG the fire / dust and water !\n- Fast-paced non-stop heart-attack-inducing action.\n- Varied game play - You can fly a copter for example.\n- New enemies introduced in stages.\n- Choose characters with unique special weapons ( like Gordon with his AntLions !!! )\n\nCons:\n\n- Flippin difficult learning curve. The first few missions will have the AI hand your butt a whoopin.\n- Long missions where death means you start from the beginning. No checkpoints.\n- A countdown timer starts exactly when you really need to pee  -_-\n- Quite difficult to play on the keyboard.

It's both hilarious, and at the same time, stupidly over the top. So bad, it's good, type cutscenes :)\n\nOkay, here's the good - It's a great deal of fun, running around in your little jeep blowing the crap out of enemies. it's also got a nice selection of "Renegades" to choose from with differing abilities. And it has a fun little story to follow. I preferred playing as Gunnar btw.\n\nNegatives? The keyboard controls are pretty awful. So bad, even the intro to the game recommends a pad! Also, it's not a long game. In just 4.2 hours, I managed to beat the main game AND the Coldstrike DLC. That's pretty damned short.\n\nOverall, it's a blast to play in small doses or in co-op. And even if it was short, I can see myself starting up the game in the future, just to have a mess around. Maybe even get some achievements I missed. Recently, someone said it could've been a G.I.

After the first or second level I still had a mostly positive look on this game but as I continued to play it and got deeper into the “experience” my opinion of the title quickly did a complete 180.  Bosses that are just nothing but extra life stealers masked as damage sponges and tend to have a large array of weapon projectiles that can kill you instantly even while trying to avoid their fire.   Common enemy types of all ranges are very damage spongy while you are not, your vehicle’s inability to take any kind of fire even on normal is pathetic and an artificial difficulty addition that is unwanted and poorly designed.  Larger enemy types can literally one shot you from across 2 full screens and you have zero ability to know where the shot will come from because YOU can not see the shooter.  Projectiles are some of the most broken that I can remember in recent memory, more then 50% of the enemy types have homing projectiles which will follow you for literal MILES and turn along with you as you attempt to break the lock which is impossible, all you can do is ride it out and hope you survive long enough and avoid getting stuck in the game’s horrible level geometry.  Later levels have you pitted against flame thrower enemies, which normally you wouldn’t worry about.  In this “game” however fire units do INSANE damage to you and perhaps the best part is it’s also damage-over-time, something that an “old school” game like this should never have.  It sure is “FUN” when you’re pitted against multiple of the harder to kill flame thrower vehicles and you’re just killed by DOT rather then the actual hits, that sure is FUN and BALANCED right?  On top of everything else hitting you, splash damage is a significant threat as 80% of the projectiles fired at you have more then 90% of their damage go to you should the shot miss and impact next to you.\n\nThe vehicle handling is something out of......god I don't even know how to categorize it, it's awful, never knew an OLD SCHOOL game could put the player in so many situations where you literally roll over, and before you say anything yes I am using a 360 controller.  If you thought Borderlands or GTA4 had some of the worst driving controls in history think again, this title by far takes the gold trophy for flat out being the worst handling vehicle and driving mechanics in any game Period.  You will get stuck on every single surface and all while being shot at 99% of the time, the game takes far too long to spawn you while your sitting there on your back like a turtle getting your stomach shot off only to be spawned 1 inch from your current position and be shot at instantly.  You either get stuck on OR you careen off of the side of the many cliffs and mountain sides because, again, your vehicle handles so poorly and unwieldy that you will have to fight your game to retain control, NO proper “old school” top down shooter has ever had this issue.  One of this title’s biggest sins is the one that a few games do and that is making the player fight the controls rather then the enemies in the game universe.  If you want to turn your vehicle around you need an entire city block’s worth of room.  While using a controller is useful and somewhat better you may be better off sticking with the keyboard and mouse since you have the ability to use what the game calls “tank controls” which helps the crappy driving controls a bit but if you’re using a controller you are stuck with the horrible controls.\n\nLevel objectives range from ok to just plain ridiculous, oh and be ready for more then 50% of your total mission objectives, per mission, be timed because nothing says old school like totally arbitrary and pointless mission failing timed mission objectives.  OH yeah and having to watch the same cutscenes over and over and over and over without any ability to skip.  Later missions last upwards of up to 20-40 + minutes and should you die multiple times due to bull crap enemy sight lines or just unfair numbers/projectile spam then have fun REDOING the entire level over for an unknown amount of time until you get lucky and finish it.  There are no checkpoint systems or in game save functions that any normal PC game would have, since this is a poor SEGA console port you get none of the most basic PC game functions.  Speaking of cutscenes the voice acting is quite over the top and after a while grinds on you, normally cheesy lines are funny but really the voice actors are trying FAR too hard to make this title sound serious.\n\nWhile on the subject of having to replay the same mission over and over and over and over and over, the later missions namely 8-9 have some of the steepest balancing curves that I’ve seen in a game labeled “old school”.  The difficulty spike isn’t even fair it is a cliff face there is ZERO progression and you slam your head against a wall of every single difficult enemy in the entire game thus far AND you are in tunnels and small rooms with zero room to maneuver your horribly controlling vehicle and will die to impossible to avoid fire by everything.  Level 9 is quite literally a battle of attrition as it is only a matter of time before you run out of lives after being killed 5 times (on Normal) by honestly bull crap enemies and rooms that simply have you pitted against impossible to avoid fire and odds.  Then later after you’re down to your last life or two you’re expected to do a battle royal in a small disk shaped elevator while the enemies get progressively more and more impossible as the “ride” progresses.  Since your vehicle handles like complete garbage and you have very little effective ordinance compared to your enemies, which by the way you LOOSE every time you die so enjoy trying to beat some hard miniboss/bosses with your starting gun.  Perhaps the best part about dying is that unlike harder games like Ikaruga that give you back your weapons within a timely manner after you die this “old school” game does not, in fact after you die you may not even SEE a single upgrade.  Unlike almost every single old school and wanna-be old school shooter worth its salt you can not gain extra lives through score/coins whatever so have fun just having 4 or 5 and a 6th if you’re lucky enough to find the 1UP in only a few levels, they aren’t even in every level.\n\nThere is an RPG like leveling up system but you level up so slowly at least once you pass maybe level 10 that it becomes moot.  The items that you unlock are not all that useful and more then half of them are disposable, which all RPGs fall into the trap of having 1 or 2 good skills and the rest being filler for the skill tree.  Since it takes you so long to actually get anything useful you’re also halted from using more then 1 or 2 until much later in the levels so you’re even limited on what you can bring to the fight which is not saying much quite honestly.  The developers expect you to try all of the other vehicles which for me is around 8 or so but it’s large amount given the fact that your skills and levels DO NOT transfer over from character to character so have fun being on the lowest level if you decide to play with another character.  I honestly can not say that I’m looking forward to that especially since I’d have to go through the entire game over again each time with each character.\n\nThe coop that this title offers is really nothing to write home about, rather then following basic SMART design choices the devs chose to allow teammates to hit one another with their vehicles. Along with that you and your team do not share pickups so if you see a weapon upgrade you’d either grab it first or watch as all 3 of your teammates tries to get it first, this design flaw also encompasses health pickups as well.","March 22","false","13.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

It's certainly among my favorite games. It not only brings back memories of the good old Strike series (Desert, Jungle, Urban, etc.) in its own way, but also demonstrates what it takes to produce a top-notch, highly polished title. Everything is in the right place about this game: gameplay, controls, graphics, sounds, physics, characters, the likeable story and script, the crazy voice acting, the missions and the maps, the co-op feature... I could go on. Another great thing about it is that on Hardcore difficulty it's actually hard! After all those easy games, this one is in fact a real challenge. By the way the DLC is a great addition too. I'm surprised though that it is so aggressively discounted everywhere. But no matter the price, Renegade Ops is totally worth your time.

JOE, with lots of explosion, and a villain lusting for destruction, and some cliche sentences such as "THIS IS NOT OVER" and all.\n\nABOUT THE GAMEPLAY: The game has a skill tree to upgrade your vehicle, and two abillities - secondary shot, and special abillitie. Eventually you will be transformed into a helicopter to, which will pretty much keep the same game style. As an +, this game allow you to destroy most of the buildings.\n\nPROS: A game simple to play, with a dual stick shoot and drive style, good/detailed graphics, and a nice game experience.

The game uses a lives system in a reasonable way, letting you get more in levels and also giving you an easy option which makes them unlimited, while also eliminating the upgrade features.  If you lose all your lives in a level, you keep any experience you've gotten, so you can upgrade and try again.  The game mainly focuses on standard "Go here, shoot this stuff" objectives, while also giving you secondary objectives.  There's a balance between completing the secondary and the time-sensitive primary ones.  Also you can play as Gordon Freeman and summon Antlions.  It's not exceptional, but if you like twin-stick shooters, it's a lot of fun.  Protip: Play with a controller.

A gamepad is highly recommended tho. The visuals look very impressive with lots of details. Music and sound are equally good. It also features a level progression in which you can earn EXP Points to enhance your vehicle.\n\nDownsides, the main campaign is very short at only 5 hours across 9 missions. The Coldstrike DLC adds only 2 more missions and felt that it should've have been in the main game itself. There are no checkpoints per mission and with the limited amount of lives given, it can be frustrating when you die. Also, unless you have a native XBox360 PC Controller, you will need to download a special driver for use with other gamepads.\n\nOverall Rating: 7.5 / 10\nA very entertaining albeit short game that action fans will enjoy.

It's heavy. It's full on action from start to finish!\nLet me just start this by saying I don't like arcade shooters (I am into 4X and RTS at the moment) - and I thought this was going to stay on my HD for only a few minutes - how naive.\nIt is a twin stick top-down shooter, the graphics are quite nice, apart from the occasional fire effects that don't look a bit squarish. Controls, as long as you are using an gamepad, are great - some people are complaining about responsiveness, but to me the physics are spot on - not a simulation, but the cars feel like real cars.\nStory is told via comic-style cut scenes and they are great - the story is absurd, but that's really what it is all about - bad guy wants to destroy the world, and you go out to kill him. The cutscenes really remind me of some very old aquaman/ironman/thor cartoons I used to watch when I was a kid.\nThe game itself brings me back to the arcades I used to go to in the 80's and the games I used to play - crazy stunts, powerups, some timed missions (don't worry they are very doable) and lots (I mean lots) of explosions.\n\nHIghly recommended.\n","March 30, 2014","true","14.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

An over-head perspective vehicle shooter with almost complete freedom in where you want to go and what you want to do! It's like someone took Jackal for the NES, the Jungle Strike Series of 16-bit games, and some of the more recently incorporated arcade games seen on console marketplaces, and mashed them into the exact formula needed to make a classic-feeling game in a not-so-classic-anymore feeling era for gaming. Yes that was all one sentence. This game is well worth the price tag even at launch, and a MUST-grab when it's on discount at all. I don't say that lightly, because I'm the type of person who beat Mass Effect 4 times back-to-back, know the story like the back of my hand, and yet I still didnt pay full price for the sequel despite my insane love for the franchise. I usually don't dish out anymore than 20 dollars for any game, but if this game was only ever going to sell for 21, I'd break my principles. If you're on the edge over it, allow me to push you towards Buy.","December 27, 2011","true","11.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game uses a lives system in a reasonable way, letting you get more in levels and also giving you an easy option which makes them unlimited, while also eliminating the upgrade features.  If you lose all your lives in a level, you keep any experience you've gotten, so you can upgrade and try again.  The game mainly focuses on standard "Go here, shoot this stuff" objectives, while also giving you secondary objectives.  There's a balance between completing the secondary and the time-sensitive primary ones.  Also you can play as Gordon Freeman and summon Antlions.  It's not exceptional, but if you like twin-stick shooters, it's a lot of fun.  Protip: Play with a controller.

At it's heart, you control one of a number of vehicles (mainly jeep types) that plough through waves of enemies lead by an evil head honcho called Inferno. Upgrades are picked up along the way - each helping you to progress through the campaign.\n\nMultiplayer is offered to too, so you're not going in alone and overall, RO is a great diversion from much more serious game types. I would strongly recommend a 360 pad for this game as it's much better suited than K&M for inputs.\n\nThe only nagging issue I have with the game is that at certain stages, the game suddenly decides that you have 3mins for example to complete the objective at hand. Often, this is not long enough - and tied-in with little in the way of a saved game feature - means that many frustrating replays can be had.\n\nStill, it's a very good blaster. Well worth adding to anyone's Steam Library. 8.5/10","January 18, 2012","true","10.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There are two control schemes:  cardinal directions where up is up, down is down, etc., and "tank" controls where up is forward and steering is reletive to the car.  I'm not sure why it's labled "tank" because that's not how a tank works.\n\nAiming is much easier with the mouse because you can aim directly at a target and there is no spot you can't hit.  With the stick you have notches and gaps that leave dead zones between where your shots go.  If you park in one spot and rotate the gun stick there are spots you can't quite reach.  As a result, you have to try and balance dodging enemy fire with lining up your limited shot lanes.\n\nThen there are the objective markers that don't seem to know where they're going.  They sort of aim you down the road, but suddenly change direction.  It woulsd make more sense if they just pointed at the objective itself rather than try to follow the road.\n\nI suppose if I really worked at it I would eventually get the hang of it, but it's just so annoying and frustrating that I lose interest very quickly.  Just like I could probably eventually learn to ride a bike by sitting bacwards on the handlebars, looking in a mirror, while juggling with one hand.  But that's a lot of effort to learn such a limited use skill set.\n\nMaybe if there were more games like this it would be worth it to learn, but this game alone isn't even very fun to begin with.","March 8","false","0.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game feels like a fleshed out version of the imaginary adventures I'd play as a kid with my GIJoe toys in a sandbox with your little car shooting ALL THE BULLETS ON EARTH at the bad guy army which has nothing better to do than sit in front of you eating lead. The handling of the cars are a little squirrely and you don't have much in the way of standoff ranged attacks, but the crazy driving and shooting coupled with the ridiculous dialogue and laughable overkill of the bad guy makes this a delight. I love the way that the cars kick up dust, peel out,  and roll with the terrain, and I wish the few helicopter sequences were as well executed. There's a bit of RPG fun going on as well since each character has a unique playstyle and different augmentations you can acquire to improve your offense and defense. Co-op play is great fun too but makes things a bit easier than the normal single play challenge.\n\nTotally worth playing!","December 27, 2011","true","10.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The keyboard controls are horrific and the joypad ones are playable but far from natural to use. The other big thing of note about this game is the difficulty. I have often said that I think games should be fun. I didn't get too far with normal difficulty so I dropped it down to casual. However the leveling up and customisation of your character is not available in casual. I don't mind a game having hard settings but I do feel that all of the game's features should be available to those of us who just want to enjoy the game. Each of the characters has a special ability but half of them seem almost useless. I did like the comic book style used in the cutscenes but otherwise there was nothing too inspiring about this game. So overall I'd give this game a miss.","June 3, 2012","false","4.8"," 9 of 21 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","9","21","0","0"

Awesome graphics, nice sound effects, cool level design and an entire world of destruction.\n\nBut when I got the game and tried playing it...\n\nSure' it still has those things that made me wanna buy it and for me they looked even better than in the trailer.\n\nUnfortunatelly this game has one HUGE issue - the controls.\n\nWhen you start the game you're told that this game plays better with a gamepad. I ignored that and decided to give it a try with the mouse & keyboard. The result was a hour of frustration that made me wanna throw my display off the window.\n\nThe controls are super sensitive and you almost never seem to get the right way to tap to make the truck go where you want it so you'll basically drive like a drunk man or a snake in the sand.\n\nAnd since you can get your truck stuck in all sorts of places (between a wall and a building for an instance), you CAN'T DRIVE BACKWARDS so you'll have to struggle to get out.\n\nMoreover, since the enemy troops and trucks are stationed between buildings' you'll have a hard time killing them without dying since, as I said, steering is a pain in the...neck. So eventually you'll end up dead not because you can't get avoid the enemy fire.\n\nSo after trying 3 keyboards, thinking my keyboard is way too sensitive, and a painful keyboard experience, I switched to controller. I tried using 2 controllers, one of them being an Xbox 360 gamepad.\n\nWhile it was a little better the problems were still there. Impossible steering and direction and no reverse.\n\nTo avoid dying I decided to play on Casual, something I never did with any game I've played EVER. Everything was OK (except of course you can't level up on Casual) - the truck seemed to be tougher and enemies less efficient so I managed to get to the part where you are given a helicopter.\n\nAnd here I encountered the first bug TWICE in a row. On Normal and Hardcore you have to shoot the container to reveal the helicopter and to get it. However, on Casual I was already in the helicopter when it shipped in, yet my objective was to retrieve the package. Of course this was impossible so I failed the mission. And instead of respawning as if I died, I lost the game so I had to start all over again. And second time, same problem.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=355949809\n\nTo sum it up, I've played about 3 hours (it seems my Steam progress changed from about ~150 minutes to 50 minutes after my last attempt to play this game) and I still haven't finished the first mission. And since I cannot save, I must start all over again and again and again and...\n\nSo NO. It has the WORST control system I've encountered in my life. And I've played hundreds pf games. I'll most likely finish it someday but it's hard to get this game a good review.\n\nSTAY AWAY (unless you like playing on casual). 6/10 (Because I like the graphics and sound effects and because someone actually worked in that team :X )","December 14, 2014","false","9.7"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

You dont directly control your vehicle, but rather push it towards a compass point and it finds it's own way there. Then shooting, despite the game virtually requiring a dual stick (Analog) game pad, you can only shoot in about 8 directions. The enemy is invariably between two of your firing angles, which could be ok IF you could control your vehicle directly, which you can't.\n\nIf you're not frustrated by the fact that the computer has no restriction on firing arcs, doesn't get stuck, can drive right at you, and out numbers you, then just wait until it throws tanks at you that never miss and you probably can't destroy. An hour into it, and I'm done.

As you progress through levels completing objectives and secondary ones you gain xp to upgrade your character in 3 possible ways, like offensive, defensive and special ability. Also to note that you can play it 4 player coop which is awesome if you think about it.

I read some reviews prior to playing this and I was under the impression that this was a sandbox sort of game. You know, like, total freedom. But it's not. There are 9 missions, and you basically always drive a truck, ocassionally switching to a helicopter (why ? It's never explained), on an island that looks completely open, but in reality is not. There are paths that branch off every now and then but you basically follow the same path all the time. And there isn't always time to explore, because every now and then a 3 minute timer begins to count down so you have to race to complete your objective(s). The action is pretty solid and most of the skills are cool to use, but I'll be honest; I expected more. For me it was a disappointment.

Unfortunately, the driving mechanics aren't that great and I found my vehicle regularly flipping and fishtailing uncontrollably. I think it's because I prefer using the triggers to accelerate and brake. Using only the left stick to direct the vehicle just feels weird to me. And that means there's no reverse, so you end up getting stuck in certain spots as a result. And there is no ability to customize the controller configuration.\n\nStorywise it feels like a G.I. Joe comic book with Inferno being the Cobra Commander bad guy. Actually the story almost perfectly mimics the cartoon series G.I. Joe Renegades. It's not bad, but it's easy to overlook.\n\nWhile I have yet to play coop, my impression is coop is what makes this game fun.

It's another Sega game. Making average games with nothing special about them seems to be Sega's specialty. The basics of the game are solid, it's just nothing is really done to make it compelling. If any of the makers of the game actually cared, this could've been a fun game. The story and writing are a joke. The gameplay is very retro. There isn't that much by way of varied enemies. It seems like I only ever needed to use two tactics the entire game. When fighting a bunch of enemies, just drive back and forth perpendicular to where they're coming from and for the big tanks just keep running circles around them, blasting them until they're done. I had technical problems on the last level of the regular game. It crashed three times on me so I had to do the level extra times. It's frustrating cuz there are no check points and the last level is long. A definite sign that a game isn't very good is that it just felt like work re-doing a level when I died. There was no joy in it. The DLC added a few snow maps which got repetitive. The graphics definitely have a console port look to them. The game took about 5 hours to beat with the DLC (which was about an hour by itself).

The gameplay is fluent, the power ups were...few and far in between, and shooting everything was quite enjoyable.  I found the poke towards Gordan Freeman to be unique and cool, especially how accurate it was.\n\nThere are problems however.  Mainly...the challange.  Firstly, I started on normal.  You can take damage so quickly, and it requires almost absolute perfection and path planning to avoid bullets.  What's more, your car is very topsy turvy, and if you flip over, you are completely vulnerable.  You can't shoot, you can't right yourself back up.  You have to wait until the game does it for you.  And because of this, you can end you getting absolutely destroyed because of it.  It seems like so much is thrown at you and little freedom is given to finish an objective AND a side objective.  Maybe it was geared more for co-op or multiplayer or something of the like (which seems to be a growing trend).  Or maybe it's just because Gordan doesn't have the most well armored car.

Well, I can easily call this Jackal^2. While not related to it in any way (as far as I know), Renegade Ops features concepts based on Jackal: top-down vehicle shooting, blowing stuff up, rescuing civilians... blowing stuff up. However, take this tip for when you first start: MAKE GOOD USE OF YOUR SUBWEAPON AND ABILITY. Maybe if you're enough of a badass, you can get by with shooting alone, but you'll probably want to use your subweapon, whether rockets or countermeasures, and your special ability, which is dependant on which character you select (speaking of characters, you can play as Gordon Freeman from HL2, exclusive to the PC version). However, you'll have to deal somewhat bad voice acting as well as a very bare-bones options menu (although the game looks great and runs well on my rig). A game that i'd recommend to anyone who likes blowing stuff up.","February 10, 2014","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The controls are great on an Xbox 360 controller, but not very good on a keyboard in my opinion. It's fast paced, full of explosions, and a lot of fun. It's difficult without being cheap.

You run around in a jeep, shooting stuff, and rescuing prisoners of war.  Renegade Ops is an updated version of that game with graphics, music, and comic book style cut scenes.  This isn't a bad thing.  Renegade Ops takes a simple formula and makes a decent game.  One problem it has though, is the missions have a time limit.  You will be having fun blowing stuff up, and suddenly have to abandon that to complete the mission in 3 minutes or less.  The biggest problem is the controls.  The game is compatible with an X-Box 360 controller, but I don't have one.  You can play it with a keyboard and mouse; but controlling your vehicle is difficult.  I managed to program my controller for the game, but aiming with the second stick was also difficult.  In the end, I had to drive the vehicle with the controller, while shooting with the mouse.  This wasn't too big of a deal, but I want to try it with an X-Box 360 controller to see if I can have better results.  Renegade Ops was definitely worth the $3.00 I paid, but certainly isn't worth full price.  But it is fun and a great timewaster.","January 26, 2015","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its just fun to play, nice to look at and simple. If you were a fan of the Soviet/Nuclear Strike games from PS1 days then you'll understand immediately.\n\nI personally really like the style/graphics and sound, and for the most part, the gameplay mechanics too. Granted, its not the most involved game to play and after a while it starts to become a little repetitive, but you're never going to be sinking 00's of hours into it anyway. Pick up and play, complete the campaigns with your friends.\n\nIt has solid netcode, runs well on lowish spec computers and generally doesn't cause any fuss.\n\n8.5/10 from me for the price to fun ratio, and the lolz factor with friends.\n\n","November 28, 2015","true","11.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anitude/recommended/99300/","Anitude","Annie T. Mood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anitude/","940 products in account","A relatively short and incredibly arcadey fun vehicular top down twin stick shooter.\n\nSince the game is by the same folks who made the Just Cause series the cheese in its extremely simplistic story is ever so present and adds to that with its very comic book style cutscenes and dialogue. One thing that gripes me though is that the "cutscenes" in the game where the game just stops for dialogue aren't skippable at all. Luckily there weren't enough for me there to be discouraged to replay.\n\nThe sound in-game is a little underwhelming where the noises from the explosions, vehicles, and gunfire are pretty a bit too "equal" in volume and don't quite entirely sound like they show off much of an impact.\n\nThe game doesn't take very long to finish and it may perhaps be faster too with other people but I wouldn't know about that part because the multiplayer is pretty dead and I don't know anyone I'd play this with.\n\nIt was a bit surprising to find that I was controlling vehicles and not people. It took a little while to learn how to properly handle the vehicles I was using, especially when making turns, but it didn't take very long to get a feel for it. Personally I find that performing seemingly skillful fast & smooth drifts and turns to avoid oncoming rockets and mortars and whatever the like whilst simultaneously shooting the enemy is the most satisfying part about this game.\nThough the game will always say "a controller is preferred" or whatever when starting the game up I think it all just comes down to preference with this game since they both work. Playing with a controller makes driving a lot more smoother and satisfying however your aim in shooting is merely reliant on where the right thumbstick is pointed. On a keyboard & mouse there's a little bet less control when driving but aiming to fire should be significantly more precise thanks to the crosshair you move around with the mouse.\n\nYou get a choice of some characters with pre-selected vehicles to use before any mission. Everyone uses the exact same standard machine gun that can be upgraded to a maximum of 4 (or 3 I wasn't counting) that can be fired simultaneously. Along the way you'll also acquire other secondary weapons such as the flamethrower, rocket launcher, and rail gun that can be dropped from the bigger enemies for you to pick up & use. All machine gun upgrades and pick-ups are kept for the current mission or until you die. Each character I think controls the same though they have their own "special" weapon/abilities for your preference that can be activated with the press of a key/button.\nEach character may also level up upon use which then rewards you with a sort of "upgrade points" which are used to purchase a selection of upgrades currently available. You earn EXP for leveling by simply destroying hostiles though the more you combo up your kills the faster you level and even if you fail the current mission you keep your current levels and EXP. As you keep purchasing upgrades you'll be able to purchase more newer and possibly better ones. Unfortunately the number of upgrades you are able to equip is incredibly limited even at max level. You first start out only being able to equip one but as you level up the character you unlock more slots with the maximum being 4. Though the challenge and encouragement of the extremely minimal strategy when it comes to choosing is nice it seems a bit odd for the game to present you with all of those nice boosters only to let you use such a low amount per mission. And you're only allowed to equip & unequip upgrades when choosing a character.\n\nThere are 9 main missions in all with maps sometimes being very linear and others being a little more open.\nAlmost each mission contains one optional "secondary objective" that are merely there to give you a bigger high score and/or achievements for completing them. Plenty of these you don't really pay much attention to as you finish them along the way in the more linear maps however there are a few that have you driving off around the map a bit but again they're optional.\nThe primary objectives are simple and bluntly pointed out via the dialogue and a waypoint indicator thing for the most part. If you plan on roaming the map a bit for those secondary objectives you'd have to be weary of the three-minute timer that will eventually set if you take too long not completing the current primary objective. If you can get through each mission without getting a game over they go somewhat fast.\n\nThe difficulty settings range from Easy, Normal, to Hardcore. The game being arcadey as it is, it uses a lives system which I think works well here as it adds a bit more tension to the possible challenges it sets, at least in Hardcore mode where you take crazier damage and you only have 3 lives and wasting them all means you'd have to start the entire mission all over again. Easy mode gives you an unlimited amount of lives and the only thing you'd have to worry about in this setting is the timer that would eventually come. Normal gives 5 lives.\n\nIt's a simple game with simple objectives and simple ways of getting through them where it's all done pretty alright.","July 29, 2015","true","11.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The problems with this concept are obvious from the first minutes: first of all, your field of view is very limited due to the perspective. This means it's difficult to drive at speed, you're constantly taking fire from off-screen and you have to keep shooting at the edge of the screen in anticipation of enemies. With all the explosions and chaos it's especially difficult to spot and dodge enemy missiles, as they get covered up by the completely ineffective enemy machine gun fire. The whole concept feels archaic and I can't think of a way the game wouldn't be improved if it used a standard 3rd person camera.\n\nSecondly, all of the main mission objectives are on a timer, which only actually appears on the screen 2.30 before time is up. I assume this was supposed to keep the pace fast, but in practice it's to easy to get caught up in optional secondary objectives and run out of time, which means replaying the whole mission. You can't explore the maps at your own pace, and the timer is infuriatingly even ticking down when you're fighting a boss. It feels like a completely pointless punishment. The same can be said of the old-fashioned lives system, which forces you to retry to whole stage should your run out of lives.\n\nLastly, the controls are quite imprecise with a keyboard and a mouse, plus you can't rebind them. That's a nail to the coffin for a game that requires a constant slalom amidst enemy fire. Unless you have a supreme control of your left pinkie, it's also going to be really hard to boost (left shift) while steering left with A.\n\nAll these issues make Renegade Ops a nuissance insead of light entertainment, making it hard to recommend.","February 26","false","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I can only speak on the co-op since single player in this kind of game does not appeal to me.  But the co-op is irreperably broken, with connection issues and crashing being a huge barrier to entry.  Unfortuantely for me this meant the game was unplayable for lots of my co-op buddies and we never got around to finishing the game (or even coming close I do believe).  It would be an instant buy if the game worked, but barring any patching, which at this stage seems unlikely, its a definite pass.","February 5, 2013","false","34.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I usually found myself more fighthing my own vehicle than the enemy ones, which is ridiculous. Using the xbox pad, it's like a boozed roller skater on an icy surface trying to throw coins into a cup!! Mouse/keyboard didn't work out either. Talking about enemies, it's somewhat impossible to avoid their shots, what becomes annoying as well. I tried it in normal mode, which is already really hard. The easy one makes no sense because it withholds a lot of game features/upgrades. To cut a long story short, the game tends to become very frustrating in an unacceptable short amount of time, so I strongly recommend to try-before-you-buy.","October 17, 2015","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You don't control a person, but the vehicle (with someone inside), so sometimes you could get stuck somewhere....and the car doesn't go in reverse right away.

And the minimap could have been done better, but at least the pointers work well enough.\n\nEven if you die you'll progress, Yep, you'll die a lot. Thank god it has a tank control setting, I can't seem to drive with 3d controls. Playing it with mouse and keyboard now, wich makes driving harder, but shooting more precise. If you liked shadowgrounds or Nuclear Throne this is a cool title to try.","May 19","true","18.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It should have more players who play it, it really deserves more. Also the graphics are really cool! The thing thats a bit crappy are the explosions graphic, but its still good. I am really looking forward for more DLC'S and maybe a Renegade Ops 2 :). By the way, i am playing it from keyboard, it tooks just a little time untill you get to know the controls, but after that you will see that's easy to control it guys ^^.","May 30","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
