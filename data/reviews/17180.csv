Gameplay can be really slow if on foot, but having horses speeds it up a lot. The buffs and upgrades in regions were neat. It's a challenge to save every man in your force, but fun if you take the time.\nMaybe it's the Southron in me talking, but it was a refreshing indie game experience.\nI look forward to more of Tilted Mill's future releases!","April 19, 2014","true","8.3"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","0"

However, it does provide some nice moments of stealthy and shooty action as one controls a band of Confederate fighters and conducts raids on Union positions.  The missions have some variation with randomly generated maps:  this allows for a unique experience each time.  One also has to keep track of unit skills and differences, and the fact that as units go up in rank they also go up in stats.\n\nOne needs to play it safe:  you can't let your veteran troops die, but sometimes fresh meat is bound to fall in combat.  But since all troops are identical save Mosby and none of them are characterized at all, you might not 'care' about the lives of your men that much.\n\nFor an indie game that demonstrates a nice and fitting musical score, and a game about people fighting for the losing or villified side of history, this is a nice game.  For a historically accurate or I daresay compelling experience, look elsewhere.","December 28, 2014","true","2.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Not too hard on difficulty, and fights seems to revolve on whether your guys manage to hit the enemy first.\nStill, could be good practice for micro skills if you decide to go sword only.","August 19, 2013","true","7.8"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

About the time it actually came out in 2008. I played it a little but due to lack of interest and most importantly: patience, i left it aside for my WoW-addiction i was feeding back in those days.\n\nIt isnt the best game around, thats for sure. But i very recently started playing it again and i approached it differently. Playing it the way the game actually wants to be played, stealthy, slowly, scouting ahead, pulling a few soldiers away and taking the time to save each man in your small unit.\nIt feels great, sure every battle you do is pretty similar and repetition is one of the major drawbacks but the progression is nice and working towards upgrading each town and getting as much hardenend and seasoned veterans is fun.\n\ndunno if the current â‚¬10,- is really worth it, id more likely price it at 7 or 5 considering its 8 years old. But i must say, im really having a blast.","April 1","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You know those made for direct to DVD movies staring some B rated old star from some obscure 90's science fiction film, or 80's teen movie.
