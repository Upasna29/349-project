There are Many jobs to choose from, base jobs as well as a few unlockable ones.\nYou're allowed to Reclass after you reach a certain point in the game, when you choose another job\nyou retain all abilities/magic, ''Magic circles'' and a fraction of your stats, There are 3 dungeon modes.\nStory mode, Ran-Geon ''Random dungeon'' and Tri-Geon ''Triple Dungeons''  (Ran/Tri are both randomised Multi Floored dungeons) Really basic summation of the game, It's worth its ''Steep'' price in my opinion IF you have the option to get it on the PSP/VITA over PC do so, But if PC is your only platform then it's no big deal, it's just as responsive as the handhelds and emulated great as well.

The game is easy to learn, difficult to master with some pretty complex character customization. And of course it has the trademark NIS grind.\n\nOverall a pretty enjoyable game, though the port kind of sucks. It's at the native resolution (it's a psp game so yeah...) has some issues in controller configuration (it took me half an hour to figure why buttons weren't binding...), and is locked at 30fps.\n\nIf you don't mind the graphics it'll be fun until it gets repetitve. Your mileage will vary on that; the regular dungeons mix things up pretty well, but if you do the randomly generated dungeons they seem to be quite similar most of the time and get old. Nothing like Disgaea's item world at all.","March 5, 2013","true","33.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

But another plus, is that it always draws me back, and I always love playing it again, even if it's just a silly experience.\nNaturally, the controls flow well, and make it enjoyable to do everything, and with every citizen on the island, you'll have some nice dialogue, sometimes awkward, other times weird, but always nice.\nAnd all the classes are nice too.","March 23, 2014","true","11.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","1"

You want ACTION-Based RPG and not turn-based? Want the pixels? Love to grind? Don't care about the story? Want to customize your charater's appearance from top to bottom? Even if the story is lackluster and if you're in doubt if this game works, just give the demo a shot.\n\nA brief warning. This game is a PSP port and its' multiplayer features is not implemented fully at the moment because the PSP port's multiplayer works in ad-hoc mode (via playing locally). However, if you want a good JRPG game while your internet is screwed over, pick this game up immediately. People outside the JRPG realm?... Hard to say. There is a tutorial on it, but this game will not hold your hand once you get out of Trial Island which is more than enough for me.\n\nThis game can easily fill in 20-40~ hours of gameplay AT THE LEAST. It can go more when you want to reach cap on 8~10 different characters (Level 99 is the cap)\n\nOh, and not to forget to mention there's a Job Changer, so you can do the same grind, AGAIN! And max initial cap of any stat is 999. The universal cap is 9999. So I still got a longggggggggg way to go.\n\nThe learning curve is steep when the "Magic Circle" system is into play. Basically, you can stack your sub-characters together with your main character (the one you physically play with), and the stats get transferred to your Main Character while special tiles like "Growth" will determine your Sub Character's Leveling Parameters.\n\nIf this looks like rocket science to you, this may not be the game to pass up and if you want a simpler game, I will forward you to Binding of Isaac or Hack, Slash and Loot. Heck, even Desktop Dungeon (its free, and not on Steam). For a roguelike with a slightly higher learning curve, I recommend Dungeons of Dreadmor.\n\nIn addition, I have a 4 1/2 hour stream of a first game impression by me if you want to check that out: http://www.twitch.tv/critical__hit/b/328931483\n\nJRPG Fans wanting a grind?

You would think that a game that prides itself on customization would allow you to change the controls.\n\nAnother flaw is this does NOT allow you to transfer any of your art or data from the PSP game itself, so if you're buying this a second time you will be starting over from scratch.\n\nAll in all, if you can get past the odd controls and you're a sucker for replay/customization, this is the game for you.","May 19","true","2.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

You can jump, you can block, you can slide, and you got a variety of abilities and weapon types at your disposal. There's even a decent amount of finesse and tricks you can do, like cancelling sword slashes into blockings and then jumping out of danger to save yourself, or buffering jumps into short jumping attacks.\n\nThe enemies you face also have nice variety, and do a good job of remaining fairly unpredictable even after you've learned their fighting styles. Another thing I especially love, is that the game incorporates a subtle stealth element. Enemies won't start chasing and attacking you till they spot you, but once they do they'll chase you through the entire dungeon. Attempting to run from an enemy will cause you to rush by other enemies, who will also break into chase. This results in a frantic chase through the entire dungeon as you attempt to escape in time from the horde trying to corner you.\n\nFor customization, you're allowed to create as many characters as you like, selecting jobs, weapons, and abilities. You strengthen their abilities and growth in certain areas by drawing on the strength of other characters you've created. Visually, you can edit weapons and characters (and even animation) of your characters pixel by pixel. Don't be daunted though, because the game uses a great template for creating fairly basic but still cute looking sprites. More artistic players can still create some great stuff though.\n\nThe actual gameplay is basically divided into two games. You can make your way through the static progression of dungeons of the main campaign, which has decent level/dungeon design and is balanced well enough to not require any grinding. Alternatively, you can take on a massive 100 floor randomly generated dungeon, which feels more like a rogue like.\n\nI personally love the randomly generated dungeon, the way stealth, combat, traps, and preparation are balanced is fantastic. Unfortunately, enemies increase in level ridiculously fast as you proceed through the floors. Eventually your attacks will do 0 damage, so it's really quite impossible to clear the dungeon based on skill alone. While making it as far as you can and escaping with random rare loot (you lose everything if you die before making it to an exit), is plenty exciting and skillbased, it's still ultimately a long term process to clear it the entire dungeon itself.\n\nClaDun X2 is still a fantastic game, plenty fun, and allows you to play and create your characters to suit your needs. I would highly recommend it for some hack and slash fun.","July 12, 2013","true","31.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Another thing I especially love, is that the game incorporates a subtle stealth element. Enemies won't start chasing and attacking you till they spot you, but once they do they'll chase you through the entire dungeon. Attempting to run from an enemy will cause you to rush by other enemies, who will also break into chase. This results in a frantic chase through the entire dungeon as you attempt to escape in time from the horde trying to corner you.\n\nFor customization, you're allowed to create as many characters as you like, selecting jobs, weapons, and abilities. You strengthen their abilities and growth in certain areas by drawing on the strength of other characters you've created. Visually, you can edit weapons and characters (and even animation) of your characters pixel by pixel. Don't be daunted though, because the game uses a great template for creating fairly basic but still cute looking sprites. More artistic players can still create some great stuff though.\n\nThe actual gameplay is basically divided into two games. You can make your way through the static progression of dungeons of the main campaign, which has decent level/dungeon design and is balanced well enough to not require any grinding. Alternatively, you can take on a massive 100 floor randomly generated dungeon, which feels more like a rogue like.\n\nI personally love the randomly generated dungeon, the way stealth, combat, traps, and preparation are balanced is fantastic. Unfortunately, enemies increase in level ridiculously fast as you proceed through the floors. Eventually your attacks will do 0 damage, so it's really quite impossible to clear the dungeon based on skill alone. While making it as far as you can and escaping with random rare loot (you lose everything if you die before making it to an exit), is plenty exciting and skillbased, it's still ultimately a long term process to clear it the entire dungeon itself.\n\nClaDun X2 is still a fantastic game, plenty fun, and allows you to play and create your characters to suit your needs. I would highly recommend it for some hack and slash fun.","December 25, 2014","true","0.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Such as a "Magic circle" function which is basiclly used to give you some human sheilds that also improve specific stats based on the magic circle design.\n\nStory- This has me personally interested, although i hoped to beat this game before doing this review. Your essentially a prisoner trapped in a seperate dimension reserved for those who commit terrible crimes. The owner of this dimension enlists your help in exploring every labryinth within that dimension in order to reach a monster who dweals on the bottom floor. Spoiler alert, your the one who ends up making the creature, who can destroy the dimension your in and the world your from, wake up in the first place.\n\nCustomization- This is so in depth i had to add it as a seperate category. When you start the game you have the limited options of naming yourself, picking a hair color/style, and changing skin color. However, very soon after that you will unlock your own peronal tavern. Within this tavern their are several functions including COMPLETE customization over your characters hair color, style, skin color, eye shape/color, mouth (if you want one that bad :P), and for some of the pros at it making equipment/helms. You can also have complete customization over your characters', yes characters you can make multiple characters for one save file,  weapons and armor, however until you unlock a special function further in the game you need the equipment in question to have a customization "Title" (Its really more like an enchantment).\n\nOverall score- 9/10\nI really love this game, but their are a few tweaks here and there that i personally think could make this game much better. However, i'm sure that, despite those flaws, many people will have as much enjoyment with this game as i have had.","March 11, 2015","true","41.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","2"

Well, first off the game is really really well done. There's TONS of customizations for your character, armor, weapons, and classes. I would honestly reccomend this game if it worked on the PC but, whenever I play for about 30 - 45 minutes, the game crashes on me. The game lacks an autosave feature which makes putting hours into customization or grinding pretty much pointless once the game crashes. CladunX2 is also on the PSP and also has a spiritual sucsessor called Legasista which is for the PS3 which probably works better then this pile of dissapointing mush.","July 5, 2014","false","7.9"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","7","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/comicconreviews/recommended/206250/","comicconreviews","JUST","http://steamcommunity.com/id/comicconreviews/","143 products in account","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCoF0DRM2LI\n\nCladun X2 is about grinding and I mean serious grinding. The game is set in the tiny World of Arcanus Cella, where you basically have to fight in endless dungeons. You’ll come across other characters who are trapped in this World with you. The game features a lot of customisation for your characters. For my character the ‘comiccon’ I chose warrior class, then you have to choose a job skill and a personality trait. I picked narcissism as the trait, it doesn’t really have an effect on the gameplay, it’s just for laughs to be honest. You can create a new character at any time by going to the main menu, you can have as many characters as you want but you can only have 4 in your party at any one time.\n\nYou might be surprised that some of the dungeons in the game can be beaten in less than 30 seconds, this is actually a big plus for the game. The usual formula goes a little something like this; you beat a handful of dungeons get some items and gold. You can choose from two handed weapons like the axe, or go for the staff, sword and shield, or dagger. The staff has elemental based attacks like fire, and water, which reminds me of something like poke’mon.\n\nThe key mechanic in the game is magic circles, they basically allow you to buff your party any way your want, by placing artefacts on the corresponding spots in the circle you can give your party effect bonus such as HP+1, Attack+1, Defense+1, along with some more complicated effects. There are many different magic circles that allow for thousands of artefact combinations and therefore a practically unlimited number of different buffs.\n\nAdd into this that dropped weapons, and items have a rare title rate, meaning they also can have buffs and elemental bonuses. If you thought you weren’t going to get enough grinding in this game, well you’re wrong because add into this you have two special kinds of dungeon called neogeons and trigeons. Neogeons are randomly generated 99 floor dungeons, filled with traps and high level demons on each floor, a trigeon is the same just 3 times as large basically. In these dungeons you will come across angel and devil gates at the end of every floor these will randomly change the rare title drop rate, additionally an angel gate can change to a devil gate once you go through it and vice versa. In other words these dungeons are completely random so any skill you thought you had will be put to the test in the extreme.\n\nBeating these uber-hard dungeons, giving you’re party super-rare gear, and configuring magic circles is what this game is about. Yes there is a story..technically. But it’s mostly early on in random cutscenes that are mostly about humour more than anything else. Although this game was not developed by Nippon Icchi Software only published by them it definitely does feel like something they would have made, quirky, and for the hardcore fans of role playing games who have gotten bored of Final Fantasy and the traditional mainstream titles.\n\nThe visuals as you can see are beautiful, they are like a 16 bit classic with hyper detailed animations, the attack patterns in this game are very fluid and the soundtrack is top notch perfect for old school adventuring. You even have the option to set it to classic BGM’s to give you the authentic retro feel. Although I wouldn’t personally.\n\nCladun X2 is even more obscure than it’s prequel; Cladun: This is an Rpg! So chances are many people didn’t buy the game on PSN, or play it on the PSP, or even when it was re-released on steam. It wasn’t promoted terribly well and system prisma doesn’t have the same weight as Square Enix so the series kind of disappeared into obscurity before the PlayStation Vita or PS4 came out. Which is a shame. This game is still worth playing if you have enjoyed previous Nippon Icchi Software titles, enjoy a challenge, and above all absolutely love grinding, as in Disgaea 4: A Promise Revisited levels of grinding.","December 20, 2014","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
