No Humans left playing. This game has died, anyone you see in game now is a truely dispicable level of forest troll. With so few people on ANY server, (other than 3 Chinese servers that are suspicously always showing 255/65 people online) it is completely shocking once you realize what they are doing on said servers. These cellar dwellars spend 10+ hours per day camping the ONLY 4-5 relevant places on the LARGE map, instantly killing anyone who may wander anywhere near them... paying no mind to the fact you just spent 10+ minutes of your life holding W and Shift just to get there.\n\n2.  Mind Numbingly boring gathering/ hunting food. I dont need to explain much more... its terrible.\n\n3. Nothing interesing or amusing to build once you have spent hours numbing your mind gathering, as described in point "2". When this game came out I suppose one may have found the first couple days playing decent, as there were still some things they had yet to experience. I had 400+ hours before I quit in december. I downloaded this game today thinking ... "It's been 4+ months, there must be a few new things I can experience " ...LOL was I wrong. Not only is there not 1 new thing, they somehow took it a step further and made the old things I found fun .. NOT fun.\n\n4. We must, as a community, Make a stand against these "Alpha realease" game developers that show ZERO intention of ever releasing a REAL GAME. They continue to fill their bank accounts with our money being spent under false pretenses. This hoax is becoming an alarming trend on Steam, folks are buying these "games" that were made by 3 dudes over a weekend. Steam did a great thing in making such an amazing engine, unfortunately many of these scammers are abusing the ease of the engine Steam has built to make VERY small games easily and charge $20 for them. All that's left now for these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s to do now is hire some whiz-kid graphic artist to make a few amazing trailers for " Things to Come " with the few dollars that start to trickle in.... BADDABING BADDABANG   "WE ARE MILLIONAIRS JIMMY!!".\n\n\nIn conclusion... I know point 4 may have gone over some of your heads, but for those of you who know what im talking about I say ♥♥♥♥ THIS ♥♥♥♥. ENOUGH. NO MORE.\n\nMy Advise: Do not buy this "GAME" or any other "EARLY ACCESS" or "EARLY RELEASE" game before you do extensive research into the dirty sweatpants wearing fellows who made it.\n\n\nLONG LIVE REAL GAMES!!!\n\n\n**UPDATE AS OF MAY 3, 2016**: In response to this very review and the "Helpful" clicks from you readers... The price of Hurtworld went DOWN from $25 to $15.\nIF YOU STILL THINK I WAS BEING PARANOID IN POINT "4", you may want to think again.\n\n**2nd Update May 3, 2016, 10 hours later**  Thank you all for clicking "Helpful", you are really helping the cause and it is much appreciated. SOMEHOW the devs are blocking this review from TODAYS MOST RECOMMENDED when you filter results that way. They are also flooding the reviews page with fraudulent reviews attempting to block my words from reaching you.  I WILL CONTINUE TO UPDATE YOU ALL ON THEIR ACTIONS.

There are quite a few cons, but in the long run, it's worth a purchase. Here's a sad story.\n-----------------\nAfter  multiple failed attempts at survival, I find myself teaming up with this guy. His name was Cat, and he was pretty cool. We hit it off, and end up helping eachother survive, and provide eachother with a number of usefull materials. We survived together for about two days, and I found myself getting pretty good (by good, I mean I had pants, and a shirt). One evening, at our little makeshift camp, a straggler wandered in. We told him to leave, and with some resistance, he retreated. He seemed semi aggresive, and he swung at us with a spear a few times before high-tailing it right the hell out of there. I found myself aiming at him with a bow. I ended up not shooting, just because I felt remorse, and decided that he should have another chance. We set up for the night. All of a sudden, we hear an arrow wizzing past our heads. The man had returned, this time with a bow. He obviously had much more time in the game, because his shots were pretty good. After an admirable bow fight on our part, he ended up killing us both, and looting our corpses. I could have prevented this if I had taken the shot.

No huge traffic or server crashes. Every once and a while a server goes down but it quickly comes back up. This is your basic survival game. If you were a fan of Rust Legacy than you will more than enjoy this game. Start at nothing, then end up with everything. They made C4 EXTREMELY hard to get so you have to truly hate someone in order to raid their base.\n\nThe best part about the game is the Infamy System. Let me explain what that is. You have your basic tools, gear (cloths) and items including resources and ammo and such.  When you're starting out and get killed by another player you will lose all of your ammo and resources BUT NOT lose your tools and clothing, basically the essentials. If you've killed another player you get infamy which means for 15 minutes if you die, you have a chance of dropping your tools such as guns, pickaxes and other things. This will stack higher and higher if the player does not let his infamy disappear first.\n\nThis makes the game so much better due to the fact that not EVERYONE will KOS. You will need to be cautious.\n\nGame is 10/10","December 8, 2015","true","185.3"," 670 of 754 people (89%) found this review helpful 52 people found this review funny","89","670","754","52","36"

I hope the devs dont change the core gameplay.\nRight now as early access its amazing wich is a huge shock. I hope they just add more content fix bugs and make a larger map cause everything else is superb. great job guys. I recommend this to anyone, even casual gamers that dont have the time that games like rust REQUIRE.\nPlus theres no bugs or glitches that i know of that someone can exploit to steal your stuff and destroy your base.\n\nDay 1\nI spawn and the first guy i run into claims friendly so i let him know this is my very first server. He shows me around and teaches me the core basics of the game. Surviving the elements and the animals is a task so we decide to work together. Sharing resources and all. I unfortunately strayed away from him and another man killed me with a rifle, kinda my fault i got too close to his base unkowingly. So once again i spawn in the baron desert. After only 2 seconds i run into 2 guys hanging at a fire they claim friendly so i get closer. So i start talking to them and one decides to spear me in the face while im talking. Little did he know he just dug his own grave. I spawn in the desert again and one of them approaches me saying hey sorry buddy as he tries to sweet talk me i give him a taste of his own medicine and kill him with my hatchet as his friend comes running up. I grab the dead dudes spear and start fighting his friend. At this point i am low on health and know i am going to lose the fight so i book it into the mountains. Dude keeps telling me surrender and youll live. I just laughed and kept running. As i come around a corner and lose him i run into another guy on a rock i shout out to him "help i got this guy chasing me, him and his friend are trying to continuously spawn kill me" not knowing he jumps off the rock and says "omg mrhash ive been looking for you, wait someones chasing you?" it was the guy i had first met. I was so releived to see my old friend. As the guy chasing me finally came around the corner we both jumped him. Unforntunately i died but my buddy killed him and took everything he had. Then he picked up all my stuff as well and returned it to me. At that point we were blood brothers. So i went on a search to find him again. Once we had met back up we travelled far from the chaos and decided it was time to build. (giving us a place to spawn) We traveled on many journeys that night in search of materials and food. The elements were vicious but our teamwork kept each other alive. Timing everything perfectly. We finally had established a safe place sufficient to start a farm seeing as food was scarce for us in our biome. I decided to take a little break at this point, but upon my return he comes running up to me all excited "I found a car i found a car!!!"  so she takes me to the edge of our mountain base and points down at the nearby shipping yard. Right there in front of us was this beautiful dune buggy. I quickly responded does it have an engine? Unsure of what parts this car had we decided to investigate. But this area had been off limits due to the high amount of yetis that lived there. We decided it was time to take one on in sacrifice of getting that car. So we gather all our fruits and make as much gasoline as we can, equipped ourselves with food and weapons and went for it. Here we are finally infront of this amazing vehicle we quickly check it for parts and noticed this bad boy is ready to go. We pop the gasoline in the tank and take off for home. Little did we know the engine was damaged and didnt have enough power to make it up the steep mountain pass into our base. We make the decision to strip all the parts and store them til we figure out another option. As the sun comes back up we headed back to the car to make sure it was still there. Realizing we could push the car with our spears we begin jabbing the car up the hill. Using teamwork to force that sucker up there we were successful. We finally had our base with a garage, and a car. That first day had brought me and this fella together as one. Feeling so accomplished we decided it was time to clock out and get some sleep.\n\nDay 2\nShaking from what i might find when i log back on i click the join server button. To my suprise my new found friend is in our base farming and excited to see me. He says "your not going to believe this" i worry a little but he seems too calm for it to be a bad thing. He begins to tell me how he met a man who helped him out with some much needed supplies, then he tells me the man has givin us an engine. Not a broken one, not a weak one, but one of the best engines around.\nSoo excited i tell him lets go for a spin, i would very much like to meet this nice mechanic.We approach this new allies base and he greets me with arms wide open. He gives us access to all his supplies and even gives us a room of our own. We gathered with this mans allies and roommates to hunt down more vehicles and supplies. Bringing back plenty for everyone we ourselves decide to help out some unfortunate players that were experiencing some troubles with trolls. Pulling up in a new buggy with nice clothes and full set of guns i approach and share what i can. Turns out one of the guys harrassing these fine folks was none other than the man who killed me the day before. I couldnt help but laugh thinking about how karma was gonna be a real ♥♥♥♥♥ this time around. We were fully equipped and had an army behind us. These guys stood no chance.","December 12, 2015","true","62.5"," 373 of 405 people (92%) found this review helpful 175 people found this review funny","92","373","405","175","15"

Constant 45-60fps+)\n• Various biomes all containing different animals/materials (Some biomes have more of one thing than others)\n• Weather system (Rain/Sun/Dust Storms etc..) All of which effects characters stability\n• Driveable cars (Find the car chasis on the map and apply wheels/motor accesories) Remember to make some gas!\n• Consistent updates\n• Moddable custom servers\n• Online livemap to see your character and any friends (Those familiar with Rust already know what this is)\n\nGame Cons\n• High pop servers tend to have minor rubberbanding/lag. Not enough to actually leave the server, but it's there\n• The voice that plays to indicate you're hungry, or full, can get annoying. Sounds like it was recorded on a cheap mic. I don't get it.\n• (Please leave any further cons in the comments. More will be added (hopefully not) as players call them out)\n\nControversial\n• You keep your clothing and hotbar items upon death (Might be different on some servers, I honestly havent checked)\n\nRelateable Games\n• Rust Legacy\n\nConclusionIf you enjoyed Rust Legacy, or are just looking for a new survival game to get into, Hurtworld is where it's at. At first I didn't thing i'd enjoy it as much I did. But once you really get into it, things get intense pretty quick. I would reccomend this game to anyone who likes the survival type genre.

This game is still functionally pretty basic, but for some reason it is as addicting as meth. Well, as addicting as my friends tell me meth is, since I'd never ingest illicit drugs. Oh, Christ....insects crawling under my skin!!\n\nSo, anyway. Where were we?\n\nThat's right: Hurtworld. So it's early access survival and yup, I just saw you cringe and I felt your pain. When I saw this one pop up, I also somewhat sarcastically rolled my eyes at the thought of yet another survival sim, once again let loose in early frickin' access. The fat Irish policeman in my brain was instantly twirling a baton and snarling, "Move along, folks. Nothing to see here."\n\nThen I heard that this is an Australian game. I, Sir, was coloured intrigued.\n\nSo at the time of writing this review I have about 50 hours up, most of that lone wolf, and I've had it less than a week. And I'm enjoying every bloomin' minute of it. But, if it is still so basic, why?\n\nHere's some pros:\n\nGraphic design is a little unique, kind of cartoony, but not annoyingly so;\nLight and shade is spot on - seeing a campfire from a distance at night for the first time was a treat;\nRuns well and has surprisingly few problems and glitches - thereby putting AAA titles like H1Z1 and DAYZ to shame;\nThe biomes are each quite different - from sandy deserts and chilly snow, to what looks remarkably just like the Aussie outback;\nThe crafting tree is intuitive, and all the weapons, gear and machines can be crafted;\nThe infamy system ties to the amount of player kills, which means the killer then gains a higher loot loss rate on death - this seems so far to have acted as a "consequence" to discourage the kind of rampant KOSing that seems ever-present in games like DAYZ and Rust - meaning that I've met a ton of players in Hurtworld who don't just automatically want to ♥♥♥♥ my corpse as soon as they see me;\nThe survival aspect is interesting, as you can die from freezing at night, heatstroke in the desert and/or during duststorms, poison, radiation, and from an array of animals...not to mention other players;\nBase building is a treat, with tons of scope for some quite sophisticated structures;\nBases and stored loot are permanent (until wipe, of course) and bases can only be breached using very difficult to craft C4 - meaning that most people will only go after a base if the perceived rewards outweight the hefty cost of the C4;\nGuns are extremely hard to craft, and I mean extremely;\nIf you die, you keep all your basic tools in your hotbar as well as your clothes - unless you're infamous, at which time you can lose any of these;\nThis game sells itself as hard-core, and in many ways it is;\nGood friendly devs; and\nAir-humping with friends...yeah, baby. You know what I mean.\n\nHere's some cons:\n\nMissing some way to identify KOSers and waste them without suffering infamy - this could be addressed by perhaps adding a bandit type skin system similar to old school DAYZ and also tweaking infamy;\nNo free look;\nStill feels like it could contain a lot more content (the devs have said there's plenty more to come), as it seems once end game is reached (guns), there may not be much to do (but I could be talking crapola, having not yet reached endgame content);\nStill has sociopathic KOSers (which is also kind of a positive) including one little annoying bast*rd who called out in a reedy ten year old's voice that he was friendly, and then promptly speared me in the face when I felt sorry for him and stopped to help...Oh, I'm coming for you sonny, and when I find you I'm going to hit you harder than puberty will; and\nMissing unique character creation and no female characters. I really want female characters so that my air-humping exploits aren't always so Brokeback Mountainey.\n\nSo, in summary, although this game is in very early release and there's more filling in of content to be done, it already runs great and is just so fun to play. The devs are obviously very invested in it, and already are talking about some great content they want to introduce.\n\nFrom the minute you spawn and start hurriedly picking up driftwood and stones to build a fire and avoid freezing to death, to the point where build a base and fill it with high end machinery, you'll have a blast.\n\nYou should buy it. I dare you.\n\nNah, I double-dare you.","December 22, 2015","true","159.0"," 223 of 253 people (88%) found this review helpful 131 people found this review funny","88","223","253","131","6"

As soon as the cheap campfire is out of wood, it disappears (don't know if this is a bug). So you have to craft a new one which is pretty expensive for early game.\n\nThere are towns that drops loot (I've only got gasoline and ammo from the boxes so far)\n\nIt's easy to learn how to play the game\n\nHeadshots are deadly unlike new Rust (for those who doesn't play that, It takes around 2-3 arrows in the head to kill your target if he's armored on new Rust)\n\nBuilding system is simple (works like the building plan in Rust)\n\nVehicles. You don't have to run across the map to find a certain resource. Because of the biome you live in doesn't have much of that resource.\n\nMap is always the same and the size of the map is good. I always see a bunch of people running when I'm out of my base. (50 players is maximum on a server)\n\nThe AI is OK. The monsters and the animals has different kinds of attacks. The boar charges towards you for example.\nThere are also monsters that are difficult to kill if you're alone or you have just started, like the Yeti. The Yeti takes alot of damage.\n\n- Cons\n\nThere are no budget clothes that will protect against the cold in the snow biome. So you have to sit infront of the camp fire all the time during the night in early game. (Will edit this review if this is a bug)\n\nThe rubberbanding is crazy sometimes and it will get you killed.\n\nThe vehicles are pretty hard to control right now. Sometimes you can't stop the car or turn the car.\n\nYou don't have any starting items in Hurtworld (like in Rust you have your rock as starting item to gather resources).\n\nThere is no cooldown to respawn at your totem right now.\n\nYou can't deauthorize people which has authorized themselves on your totem right now (the totem gives you privilege to open every door in the house, and also respawn at the totem).\n\nThere are no sleepers. If you disconnect, your body will disappear. You're afraid of getting raided when logging off? Well just put the most valuable stuff in your inventory and it's safe for the night.\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\n\nI will edit this review when I've played more of this game. Can't think of any more pros and cons right now.\n\nEDIT 1: Added more cons.\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\nBut I recommend this game and especially for people who wants to get that legacy Rust feeling again.\n\nVery funny and intense game!","December 7, 2015","true","9.0"," 216 of 256 people (84%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","84","216","256","21","10"

With or agaisnt eachother. This game is great for players that are less interested in PvP, but still want a touch of it. The community is nice and with the  "imfamous" system they have in place, people don't kill on sight and however kill only if nessecary (Or if they're a tnuctihs)  <- Read it backwards. You use C4 to blow up and raid bases. C4 is extremely hard to get therefore making it quite rare, players will use it wisely. With that being said, the game focuses more on the survival aspect rather than the PvP aspect.\n\nWith that out of the way, lets talk about the basics of the game. The crafting is very easy, straight forward, it shows all craftable items and the recipes. The base building is easy to learn, and hard to master. You'll easily learn the mechanics and the basics of base building but each time you'll learn from your mistakes.\n\nThere are a few flaws in this game, few glitches etc. But what the heck? It's a game in alpha, and plus the devs have an active reddit page and work hard. In general this game is very fun (especially with friends) and has great potential.\n\nI look forward to seeing the game continue, grow and strive.","December 16, 2015","true","126.9"," 255 of 311 people (82%) found this review helpful 68 people found this review funny","82","255","311","68","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xxdeadearthxx/recommended/393420/","xxdeadearthxx","Goblin-Bro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xxdeadearthxx/","368 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThere are couple of problems I encoutered with this game and to me, they are egregious enough to me that I feel the need to warn other potential consumers.\n\nHarvesting:\n\nYou start with literally nothing. Your avatar may have some boxer shorts on, but they are part of the character model and you truly have nothing. So you start your journey picking up whatever tidbits are on the floor in order to build some basic tools, which would be fine if the harvesting wasn't partially RNG based. Often times, completely identical looking stones on the ground will give you different resources, so you can never be sure that you are ever getting closer towards your goal.\n\nOnce you have some Tools, perhaps the Axe, a persons first thought would be to hack at trees right? Trees must give wood, that's logical.\n\nWrong.\n\nYou can only harvest fallen logs in the world and dried up dead trees that exist in certain places in the world. Healthy trees cause your Axe to bounce off harmlessly.\n\nThe other resource node you can harvest look like sculptures of colored rocks, which require that you have a pick on you. Different colored nodes yield different quantities of resources, but you will never be certain of exactly what you will harvest due to the inane RNG harvesting thing I mentioned before.\n\nThis is further made frustrating in the way harvesting takes place. You left click on the resource node with the appropriate tool until the node breaks apart and only at the end of the break do you gain resources. If someone comes running by and has a higher level harvesting tool, they end up dealing more damage to the node and will manage to harvest your node before you could ever do.\n\nCombine this with absurd costs of various items and the rarity of certain resources, this creates a scenario where a player is likely never to know exactly what they need in order to get the goals they desire.\n\nWhich leads me to the second bit I despise.\n\nPlayer Killing:\n\nThis game handles player vs player interactions with a sort of karma system. When a player with no bad karma kills another player with no bad karma, they get a visible timer on them that shows how long they are marked. I forget the in game name of this mechanic, but suffice to say, this is something that is often abused.\n\nLet me explain.\n\nA player with no karma timer on them, when killed, retains all their gear and clothes upon death and spawns with it in their inventory. A player who dies while their karma timer is still active loses all their items.\n\nThis sounds like a nice way for non-violent players to play the game, but any player who dies still loses all their resources. Often times, groups of players will harass other players into killing them just so that their buddies can come and kill the now karma marked player and loot all his items.\n\nThis system manages to not solve the horrid KOS problem prevalent with these survival games at all and even makes the experience worse for those players who successfullly defend themselves only to then be killed and lose EVERYTHING as opposed to just their resources.\n\nIt's dispicable.\n\nThe last problem I had with this had to the frequent server restarts.\n\nEvery 20 minutes, it seemed, servers have to restart, which requires that every player on the server get disconnected, wait a few moments and then manually reconnect.\n\nPlayers only get a 5 minute warning of when this will happen, which is never enough time for players to find a safe area to be in before the restart.\n\nWhen a player finally logs back in, they may find that other players are there already and have killed the player while they were spawning into the world.\n\nIt's awfully annoying for a server to have to restart so frequently to start with, but then logging back into the game just to find yourself dead is just unacceptable to me.\n\nI do not recommend this game. 24 dollars is just not a sensible price when there are games in the survival genre that are much MUCH more developed and thought out than this game and also cost less.\n\nYOU GUYS COULD BE PLAYING SOMETHING THAT IS SLIGHTLY MORE FUN THAN THIS FOR SLIGHTLY LESS THAN THIS GAME COSTS!!\n\nAnyway, I didn't realy have fun with this game at all, I didn't find it's crafting intuitive in the least nor did I enjoy the combat or survival systems. The community was meh, but that's to be expected in these games.\n\nAll in all, I'd say look elsewhere for your survival gaming. This game is just not fun.\n\nEDIT 5/4/2016..\n\nAs someone was so kind to point out, this is an Early Access title and potential purchasers should expect problems with the product. So while I understand that an Early Access title is not finished, I am reviewing this game based on what is currently available and what I have played, not on what the game might be when it's finished.\n\nAs always, do your research on EA titles and wary. My "NO" on recomending this game still stands.","May 3","false","6.4"," 195 of 232 people (84%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","84","195","232","15","7"

There is a reason why!\nI have played practically all the well known survival games on the market. DayZ, Arma2, Arma 3, Rust, Miscreated, H1z1 Reign of Kings.. the list goes on. And year after year a new survival game comes out which is IDENTICAL to the last.\n\nBe warned, this game is considered a Hardcore Survival. This isn't your average "Get everything in 4 hours of gameplay" game. It's hardcore, the biggest initial challenges is keeping your hunger bar under control and staying warm. The players aren't the only enemies in question here. The terrign, the animals, the players are all out there to kill you, and it's your job to stay alive. Having said that, when you have aquired your clothes as you may know you keep it (unless you're infamous). I love the infamous system as it makes people think twice before shooting noobs.\n\nThis game is absolutely amazing, I have played 6 hours of it currently and will be playing many many more. Those that are saying "Oh right, yeah another survival sandbox big deal" think again my academically challenged friend, this has all of the best parts of Rust, Arma 3, ARK all mixed into one orgggggggasmic game. The developers work hard, the game has frequent updates to what has been shown and it's phenominal.\n\nTwo words word. Rust Legacy. I'm not going to go ahead and say the game is identical to legacy because it is far from it, but I don't know what it is about it, but it's so so good. Looking at gameplay, it has the ability to make the game not look good, but when you get in, and you're doing it believe you me it's awesome.\n\n"Do I buy this game?"

It's like a curse, in which my wallet and my happiness must suffer. So naturally, I wanted to give Hurtworld a try. I was compelled to.\n\nI logged into a server and immediately encountered a neutral player trying to shoo me from his gathering area. He threw his spear at me, missing, all the while communicating to me with voice chat to go away. Point taken, I high tailed it out of there half-naked and with nothing to my name. A couple nights later I had established some basic tools but died of hypothermia. I have not died since. You learn to prioritize resource gathering and craftables, to keep a campfire at the ready for the harsh cold nights. I encountered friendly players, who offered some spare leather or had a kind word in passing. But I also encountered my first hostile player, who tried to coerce me into dropping all my logs. I refused and he chased me with his bow. I turned on him, spear in hand, and wacked him over the head. He didn't like that. I chased him off with my stick and very suddenly a blinding dust storm kicked up. He complained about not being able to see and I used that opportunity to get away -- even though I was the one chasing him. It felt great, as a new player, to be able to defend myself against others. And even better to see how the environment had protected me and given me cover. Cool.\n\nA few hours of gameplay later and I have claimed a plot of land, clothed myself, crafted a back pack, built a small home, stocked up my storage container, created tier 2 tools, and am ready to explore. I feel I have met small milestones and there is a sense of accomplishment and survival. I have hunted and gathered my way to basic comfort and survived the few hostile players.\n\nWhat the future holds, I am uncertain. I'd like to believe I cannot progress through the game so quickly. I'd like to believe great dangers lurk where great rewards lie, but I have not explored far enough yet.\n\nHere's what I do know: The game is fun, it is a solid title for Early Access, the community isn't totally filled with jerks (at least not on the server I joined), and I can only hope the developers expand on this game as I want more of it.\n\n-Pros-\n+While it is an EA title, it feels like a solid game with a full feature list. Highly playable.\n+Runs smoothly, no crashes, high frame rates\n+Combat is adequate\n+Survival takes some effort and thought during the first couple hours\n+Basic resources continue to be useful\n+Player community\n+I not YET encountered a cheater\n+The server I play on is not full when I want to play\n+Its fun\n+You keep your tools when you die, but drop your resources\n+HUD is clutter free\n\n\n-Cons/Other Thoughts-\n-Hypothermia is a bit harsh\n\n-Overheating mechanic is ridiculous. I'd understand if you overheat from the desert sun. But instead you overheat from being near your campfire or firepit, which is required for cooking food and smelting ores. It is ridiculous that I can't be anywhere inside my house while the firepit is going or I will start to overheat. Overheating can very well kill you. This could turn into an interesting mechanic if water is required to cool down from the hot desert or player must find shade or equip special gear. Tedius, but could be interesting. As it is right now its downright annoying.\n\n-Some resources will appear at a certain distance away, but will not be there when you approach, and may reapper after wandering around a bit. Similarly, the LOD on creatures is questionable. Bors can look a bit like logs at a distance because they are boxy until you get close enough for their details to be clear. And sometimes they won't appear at all until right up next them. Minor bugs.\n\n-Building a home is nice, but needs some work. There are no stairs or ladders. And you do not get any of your resources returned when you destroy something you've built. Certain resource requirements make no sense.\n\n-Crafting menus could be improved on, but not really a con. They work as intended.\n\n\nOverall, for 20$ I am enjoying the game and look forward to playing more of it.","December 24, 2015","true","17.3"," 105 of 115 people (91%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","91","105","115","22","7"

For three days we logged on to add more to our base always afraid of making a mistake that would leave us vulnerable. On the third day, after we finally began to gain enough courage to venture our to far reaches of the map, we opened our door to find 4 naked men standing outside, and they rushed in. We had somehow left our outside airlock open, and the moment I saw them, I knew it was over. Their 8 year old voices screeched through my headphones as they ransacked our base, taking everything and destroying our walls. I sat their shocked, letting myself get killed over and over by these nude characters that had inflicted so much pain on my soul.

You need to hunt for your food on easy mobs such as Dears or Rabbits . if You try to fight a Boar on a early stage of the game without a bow you are most likely going to die but that's not the case of it beging pre-planned but the really well balanced loot and difficulty.  Making anything that's based on late game is a real challenge recipes for crafting are really well planned so it's not easy or either very very hard for the basic items but items such as Riffles are not that easy to make and would require a lot of time grinding items.Building in this game is really good planned you can't grief somoene's house with just an axe you need to grind really really hard to get C4.C4 is not really that common as you may think and it requires a lot of time trying to get the correct materials to craft 1 piece of it.Last but not least the cars and temperature system , cars are really easy to find around rad zones (radiation zones)/ Towns. The trick to that is that you will need to find a lot of parts before you can drive this beauty and that's really based on your luck in towns cause the only way to get parts is from looting towns.Temperature System is really balanced you can't get rid of the cold with crafting some clothes, you are only going to get Cold Resistance so each night you are going to need to stay close to a fire otherwise you are going to freeze to death.\n\nDeath In This Game\nDeath in this game is based on how much Infamous you are.(You get more Infamous by killing people . I'am not 100% sure about this part but from what i red and learned myself. When you are not Infamous you drop only your items but the items in your Hotbar are still there after death that means if you had tools in your Hotbar you are going to keep them and also your clothes, backpack etc. When you get Infamous you are going to lose all your items on death.\n\nDiffuculty of learning the game.\nThe game itself is really easy to learn you don't need to dive into tutorials on how to do certain things crafting is the most simple thing you could think off.You can get into the game and get experienced really quickly without spending hours.\n\nAbout Hurtworld\nHurtworld is a hardcore survival game and the developers did a really good job on making it really a hardcore game.First 10 minutes when I got into the game it was really hard to survive at all i barely made it alive from the first night the cold was really hard to get through while running for supplies to make a basic camp fire my i was getting colder every single second.Every night you need to stay close to a source of heat otherwise you are going to die.Ofcourse there is a way to increase cold resistance but it's still challenging to survive the night.\n\nGame Pros and Cons\n\nGame Pros\n+ Really Really good survival it's rough to survive the first days and still challenging in the later stage of the game.\n+ It's really hard to get guns,So basicly pvp is bows and spears\n+ Cars are really balanced they are there but they are element of the end-game.\n+ The entire game is very well pre-planned.\n+ You can't get griefed easily and it's really hard to make c4 to grief somoene.\n+ There is a lot of PVE elements such as hard creatures to kill such as (Yeti and a bird with 8x times bigger head than normal birds)\n\nGame Cons\n- Map is not the biggest but it's good for the current state.\n- There is couple of glitches such as your head can glitch through the wall of your own house and you can die from somoene outside.\n-Wipes,Wipes,Wipes...The game is in EA so there will be a lot of wipes while updating so get ready for it before buying :)\n\nDo i recommend the game in the current state? : Yes.","December 6, 2015","true","9.1"," 201 of 256 people (79%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","79","201","256","24","20"

I know this is a fact everyone knows, but it is a Rust clone, and to be honest, I'm fine with that. The game does some things better than Rust, some things worse. It's cartoonish appearance makes it interesting. Vivid colors and clear contrast is half it's charm. The hardcore factor is not really true though. There is nothing in this game that is hardcore. Within an hour of playing, you will know the game mechanics and how most necessities work.\n\nPROS\n-Beautiful graphics\nAs I said earlier, the graphics are amazing. They need more polishing, but they are pretty nonetheless. Gun textures are pretty dull though. I would choose this game over Rust when it comes to graphics.\n\n-A sense of achievement\nThis is something the game nailed. When it's so easy to lose your resources, building a huge fortress feels amazing. The fact that the whole world is working against you makes every little upgrade worthwhile, and pretty satisfying. The simple upgrade from an Iron Hatchet to a Gold one is pure bliss.\n\n-Nice building model\nThe building in this game is actually pretty stellar. You shape your house as you please, and that's something we didn't have in Rust. (More in Cons)\n\n-Cars\nAmazing for transportation, really cool models aswell. (More on this in the cons)\n\n-Great open map\nThey really did a good job on the map. The hill areas need polishing, but the overall map is epic. Making a base in each biome is a must-do task.\n\nCONS\n-The Servers\nOh my God. I realize that we are currently in the Alpha Stage, but the servers are garbage. With the rumor of new servers, I hope that I can one day edit this part out. You'll often find yourself shooting at a boar, just to find out it has teleporting abilities with will literally be a pain in the ♥♥♥.\n\n-Cars\nI know I put ''Cars'' in the Pros aswell, and this is why; The chances of you ever getting a car in this game are so slim you would have more luck getting a car in Minecraft. The drop rates for car parts are garbage, and after 55hours of play with a whole clan of people, we have managed to get three wheels. Not to mention the sheer amount of bugs with vehicles. Sounds glitching, clipping through the map, randomly getting thrown out... If you are buying this game for the cars, don't bother.\n\n-''Infamous'' System\nI realize that this is here to make the game a bit more unique, but in my opinion it is one of this game's worst features. A rich individual can go to spawn and go bananas on some fresh-spawns without much consequence. This game's whole thing is it's hardcore factor, and this is where the hardcore factor goes away. Tools are harder to make, but you will always keep them as long as you don't kill anyone.\n\n-Community\nThis doesn't really go under the CONS area, because the Devs can't change this; but it is worth mentioning nonetheless. If you have never played games like DayZ, Rust, and like like, be prepared to be KOS'd. There doesn't need to be a reason behind your death, as long as the Russian behind the scope is trigger happy. The Infamous system counteracts this to a certain degree.\n\n-Bugs and Glitches\nI know this is completely normal in an Early-Access game, but nonetheless worth mentioning. The game is plagued with game-breaking glitches and annoyances. The whole Survive-bar is annoying as all hell. The Wetness factor and Temperature need so much fixing it shouldn't be in the game yet.\n\nSUGGESTIONS\n-Party System / Friends\nEven though you can share your house with your teammates, there is no way to identify them. No way of adding them on a friendlist, or mark them some way. Forget playing together if you don't use TS3 or the like. (You should do this anyway) This should be implied as soon as possible.\n\n-Drop Rates\nSome fixing needs to be done with this. At the moment, they are completely horrendeous and need fixing.\n\n-Map\nThis game is in desperate need of some type of map. We currently have a ''compass'' which shows the user it's homes/bases, but no real way of knowing the area. Combining the Beacon and a map function would make this game a lot easier and more enjoyable to play.\n\n\nAll in all, this is a game worth trying. If you are a fan of Rust or DayZ, it's a truly refreshing. Even though there are a lot of Cons, I still love this game for what it is, and I hope they will fix some of these.\nRating: 8/10\nEdit; 2.

Here is my Early Access Launch Day LiveStream Video 1:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fb3JJxS5Qw\n\nThis is a rare gem, and for early access, this gem shines and shows developers who care about making a FUN and fantastic hardcore PvP open world sandbox game.  I have never heard of it until I found it last night about 30 minutes before it launched in early access just hours ago.  And I was going to go to bed dammit as it launched about 1am my time.  - Now the sun is coming up and I haven't got a wink of sleep {Points at the reason for my sleepless night but with a smile on my face..}\n\nDoes it have bugs?  Yes.  Is it complete?  Nope.\n\nBut this game is amazing for a game like this just launching in early access.  I didn't think I'd see a game that I fell in love with like I did when I first experienced Rust in December of 2013, two years ago.  I'm not trying to over-hype this game guys... but Move over Rust because you just met your match.  Hurtworld looks to offer more content, smoother gameplay that I only wished Rust ever had, and every bit of the Risk-Vs-Reward drama that made Rust so freakin' awesome when it first launched.\n\nMy Launch Day in Early Access LiveStream Video - Part 2:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fb3JJxS5Qw\n\nI'll be posting plenty of videos on this game, but for now, just know that if you loved Rust, Hurtworld is a MUST-BUY for you, period.  Enough said.  Buy it now, and thank me later.  Likewise, if you hate player versus player games and hate getting ganked and looted, then you'll likely hate this game too.  But for a ton of people like me that always loved Rust but always wanted something that played smoother and offered more... Hurtworld is for you my friends!\n\nMy Early Access First Impressions score, In it's early access alpha state mind you...  Hurtworld gets a 96% from me.  (Value = 40 out of 40, Fun = 30 out of 30, Controls & Bugs = 18 out of 20, Graphics & Sound = 8 out of 10)\n\nMy Launch Day in Early Access LiveStream Video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyOwW_pf7bQ\n\n\n***** Note To the Developers *****\n_____________________________________\n\n..First off, I want to say THANK YOU for showing what 'early access' SHOULD mean to all these shady developers who launch their garbage and empty promises here on Steam just to try and make a buck.  This game is truly a breath of fresh air in a cess pool of early access filth these days.\n\nBeyond my thank you... I also want to tell you guys to GET READY FOR INSTANT BIG TIME SUCCESS.  Rust sold a million copies in about two months when it launched in early access.\n\n- - Mark my words...\n\n$ * *  You guys will sell more copies of this game in less time then did Rust two years ago.  * * $\n\nI hope you guys are ready to be millionaires.  I also hope you are ready to support this game and are able to stop the hackers and "doooooosh bags" who will try and ruin your game with hacks, cheats, and exploits that will come with what I predict as a very fast climb to Steams best selling game in the coming weeks.\n\n..Thanks again devs for this.  You're monetary rewards are coming I'm confident of that, but thank you from a gamers true heart for making a game not to make money but a game that gamers want to play.\n\nSee My Playlist of ALL of My Hurtworld Videos On My YouTube Channel Right Here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYL0JJsOk9muAF_X0SNMuFRwxiKs4CxtF","December 4, 2015","true","129.6"," 88 of 112 people (79%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","79","88","112","17","0"

Me and my friend saw this as the brilliant opportunity it was to go and destroy these kids and take their car... So we did. we took the parts and ran into our base.\nI didn't believe we would be safe for long as they knew which base we came from and were advancing on it as we were putting the stuff away. I told my friend to get packing and i myself packed the best things i could and we teleported to the desert, made a 1x1 with storage and dumped everything in there. About 10 minutes later i teleport back to the actual base and when i was taking the rest of the loot for a second trip, when i heard an ear piercing screech of an obviously very angry foreign man.\nhe was furious, unloading his gun into the poor walls of my base. Once he figured out i was inside, he yelled "GIMME BACK MY CAR" with which i replied a quiet "no" followed by a cheeky giggle. he repeated himself at the top of his lungs and i could hear he was still yelling with the mic off because i heard the start of a yell just before he let go of voice chat. At this point i was crying of laughter  despite the fact i was a little bit scared, this guy was a maniac.\nSo since me and my friend had pretty much already decided that base was toast, I soon had everything from the base with about 10 seconds before teleporting back to the 1x1 i had made in the desert. In those 10 seconds i yelled "USE C4" he replied "YOU WANT ME TO USE C4 HUH?" i lied and said that i was bored as ♥♥♥♥ and wanted someone to raid me, and then i teleported away.\nabout 20 minutes later i just saw him type in chat "♥♥♥♥ YOU"\nSo i waited a while before teleporting back and when i did, the base was half destroyed, he had done it. He had just lost 2 cars and about 3 C4.\n\n5/7 would ruin another man's life again","January 7","true","146.5"," 65 of 82 people (79%) found this review helpful 58 people found this review funny","79","65","82","58","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LeMorrow/recommended/393420/","LeMorrow","LeMorrow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LeMorrow/","292 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nEnglish isn't my first language, sorry if your eyes pop when reading this.\nAlso, sorry for the really long review\n\nI'll start by saying that I enjoy this game a lot. It's kind of what I wanted legacy rust to be like, so if you enjoyed that game you're probably going to like this one as well. But please, before buying this game, remember that it is very early alpha and you will most likely die inside of a mountain or break your legs off the shortest fall in the world quite a few times. Unless you're ready to face a lot of glitches you might as well wait a few months to get it.\nI'll list some of my own opinions here. Some people might not agree with me on these.\n\n+ Gather rates\nIt will take you a while to get your house going unlike new rust. It's very balanced.\n\n+ The bow\nIf you enjoyed the bow in legacy rust you're probably going to like this one as well. It will one shot players in the head which makes it a great weapon when you're starting out, making you able to kill the best geared player on the server with one shot. It's also used in lategame PVE. This is explained further down.\n\n+ Graphics\nI play on the lowest settings and it makes you kind of fuzzy and cozy. It has a cartoony touch to it which i personally think is beautiful\n\n+ Combat\n"It feels like they've built a fps and added the survival components, not the other way around" - some youtuber which i cant remember the name of. Absolutely no player lag gamewise.\n\n+ Death\nDying isn't as harsh on you as you won't lose your tools, unless you have the "infamous" buff.   Keep in mind that some servers will have plugins that makes you drop tools as well.\n\n+ Infamous\nThis is a buff you get upon killing another player. If you are infamous and you die you will lose one tool in your inventory. If you've killed enough players you will get the "Outlaw" buff. When you are infamous you will gradually get hungrier and colder faster. The Outlaw buff will make you drop two tools instead of one. If you are killed as an Outlaw, the killer will not get the Infamous buff and therefor an Outlaw is always the primary target. Sadly, there is no way to see if a player is infamous yet, so you will have to be active and read the chat to spot the guy with the most infamy.\n\nThis balances KOS (Killing On Sight) because you would have to think through if killing that freshspawn is worth the risk of losing your weapon.\n\nA lot of people disagree with this, but I think it has great potential. But it's obviously not tweaked for the greatest yet.\n\nFor example, two players start shooting at you and you have no chance to run away from them. Obviously you would want to shoot your way out of there. Let's say you manage to get one of them but his friend kills you. Since you already killed someone you will have the infamous buff and lose a tool, while they didn't lose anything at all. (unless they were infamous as well)\nI'll also point out that there are server that have disabled infamous.  If you're new to the game, DO NOT play on one of them.  People do not have a reason to not kill you, since ammo is really cheap and there's no infamous. Also if you're new don't play on the official servers. They're pretty much the same as the non-infamous servers.\n\n+PVE\nGood PVE, even in lategame. The developers has really thought this one through. Usually you if you find one animal there will be a few others standing around it. If you shoot one of the animals with a firearm, the others will hear it and charge at you. At the lower level animals it wont really be a problem, but when you get to the more dangerous animals they start grouping in bigger groups and dealing a lot more damage. This makes it (pretty much) impossible to use a firearm for killing lategame animals, leaving you with a bow. It is challenging to kill a yeti alone for the first time, but it can be as hard to kill it after 80 hours.\n\n+ Community\nThe community is really friendly and helpful if you need help or have any questions. I guess this depends on what server you're playing on but I've had a good experience, and even made a few friends on the way :)\n\n~ Survival\nVery challenging survival when first logging in. I don't know if this is the way to encourage players to keep playing if they log in and die within 3 minutes a few times in a row. The survival gets easier and easier the further you get in the game, which is kind of what you'd expect.\n\n- C4 and raiding\nEDIT: I wrote before that c4 was not implemented in the game yet. Yesterday it was confirmed by battlemu1e on reddit that the detonator caps does indeed drop but with an extremely low droprate. It's also very expensive to craft so don't expect alot of c4 in the game yet.\n\n"The reason why currently the cap drop rate is so low and material cost is so high is that this was never the intended final balance of c4, we just need to weigh the available options for base protection against the availability of c4 to create a fairer balance for raiding." -battlemu1e\n\n"The material drop rate needs balance as do the construction items strength balance (i.e. wood<Stone<metal). Once this happens, raiding will be opened up." -DrDazzler (developer)\n\n\n- Lategame\nLategame is extremely dull. There is absolutely nothing to do when you have gotten yourself the best weapon and the best tools. Since there are no raiding the only thing you could do is build a bigger house. Or start all over again on another server.\n\n- FPS\nBad FPS and crashes. A lot of people are now thinking hmm, seems kinda fun. Will my computer be able to handle it? Well, there's not an easy answer to this. I don't have good specs so I run this game on 35-40fps with the lowest graphic settings. If you want some perspective I get around 130-140 fps on CSGO running medium graphic settings. My friend on the other hand that has a lot better specs than me, but he doesn't get this game over 17 fps somehow. (he's got NVIDIA 8-core and I got AMD 4-core)\nAlso, I have to point out that a lot of players including me sometimes get FPS drops where we get stuck in 1 FPS for around 10-60 seconds. Apparently many players get this like once every 3 hours in the game. This has killed me twice and it is very frustrating.\n\nEDIT: If you have FPS issues, try " -force-d3d9 " or " -force-d3d11 " in Hurtworld's launch options.\n\n- Resources\nResources will always spawn on the same spot, unlike Rust where it's randomized. For example, by now I know where I need to go if I need iron ore or a lot of wood. I think that it would give a lot more variety if it was randomized.\n\n- Cars\nYep. You probably thought this would be one of the positive things didn't you? Well, first of all cars are hard to obtain. When you've finally gotten your car your probably not going to wanna drive it around. Cause you will lose it instantly. There are no way of locking your car and there's no protection for getting shot in the car. If anyone sees you riding around in your car they will take you down and claim the car as theirs guaranteed.\n\n\nAs everyone else is saying, this game has great potential. I hope they will develop more PVE content and explore lands that other survival games haven't yet. Maybe some boss that require multiple players to defeat. But sadly I don't think that's what we're going to get out of this game. I think it's going to develop similar to rust and one day we'll all sit here writing another review about some other survival game and reference Hurtworld instead of legacy rust.\n\nOverall I still recommend the game. It's been great fun and it was definitely worth my 20€. I think now I'll just sit back in my chair until servers wipe or until new content gets released.\n\nDon't forget to rate if I helped you decide whether or not to buy this game :)\nFeedback is greatly appreciated!","January 1","true","89.5"," 41 of 46 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","41","46","4","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Loriborn/recommended/393420/","Loriborn","Loriborn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Loriborn/","296 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nHurtworld is a title that looks to compete in a genre that is completely oversaturating the market, especially in regards to Early Access games. Many of its gameplay elements are similar to its more popular predecessors, namely games such as Rust, DayZ, and Ark. However, while Hurtworld does not introduce many new concepts to the genre, it takes these preexisting gameplay elements and polishes them up to a shine not often found in Early Access titles.\n\nMost of the work done in both the closed Alpha and Beta was to create a stable and optimized foundation for new content to be added to when the game reached Early Access; compared to other games, FPS is relatively stable even at higher settings on lower end machines, and because the server handles a significant amount of the game calculations,  are more reliable, albeit more slow. This means far fewer instances of players hacking, and more accurate hitboxes for PvP, though it also means ping will be the determinate factor for how long it takes for that rock you picked up to show up in your inventory.\n\nThere seems to be a great deal of planning that went into the overall progression and balance of Hurtworld. Although lacking in content and variety, the existing model and flow is generally more enjoyable. Rather than giving tools durability and punishing the player with the annoyance of repairing and recrafting the same basic item every 50+ uses, many items and tools do not degrade in health and remain in the player's inventory even after death. This means more of the player's time is spent collecting resources, building bases, and interacting with other players, rather than mass-crafting a number of tools to ensure they are able to cut down a few trees by the end of the day.\n\nOn the topic of PvP, because the focus of the title is survival from the standpoint of environmental and player interaction rather than from the standpoint of mass collection of raw materials, the infamy system does a relatively fine job of keeping high tier players from picking on low tier new players. Because tools, clothing, and weapons stay in your inventory unless your infamy is above 1, and because infamy is only generated by killing other players, most players refrain from wasting their infamy on kills that are not profitable from an objective standpoint. Instead, high tier players tend to focus their PvP, if they do decide they need to kill, on other individuals that actually pose a threat to them; those with guns, cars, and bases.\n\nThe art style is reminscent of TF2, with highly saturated colors, beautifully hand drawn art, and clean, low poly models. This makes the environment rather ironically comfortable to play in, and provides a warm setting to relax in when not in immediate danger, but nicely juxtaposes to the actual risk and threat of death. Similarly, the colors and shapes make distinguishing players and fauna a much easier task on lower resolution monitors, where noisy models and textures create messy scenes over the vast open world of most survival games.\n\nOverall, Hurtworld is a rare gem of polish and potential, and while it lacks in content, the promise of modding opportunities, and beautiful code framework that has been put in place for these new additions, and the general developer transparency, put this game at a relatively good starting place if compared to titles of the same genre. If you already own Rust, Ark, DayZ, etc. and feel burned out on this type of gameplay, I do not recommend this game, as you won't find much new here.\n\nHowever, if you're relatively new to the genre, or found the poor performance and clunkiness of these other titles did not suite your gameplay requirements, Hurtworld provides oddly satisfying gunplay and a reliable network free from many of the meta issues that plague other games on the market. I would recommend supporting these developers in the hope that the interest in the game spurns their updates to be released timely and regularly, with the same polish as the rest of the title.","December 6, 2015","true","5.9"," 47 of 56 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","47","56","3","4"

MAN does it have potential to be the next best "Early Access Survival Simulator." I have made many a friend playing this, and it has to be the most punishing survival game this world has ever seen. The fall damage is realistic, you can break your legs and such, and there are many elements such as sun, hunger, health, cold, poison, heatstroke, bleeding, and many more. Each one will kill you if it gets bad enough. The gunplay is fantastic and realistic. One shot kills most of the time, so people who have survived long enough to get a gun basically rule the region. Cars are EXTREMELY hard to come by and build, making them just that much more satisfying to finally finish. You must deal with raids and raid-proofing your base, and you must make friends or enemies to survive. Conclusion: I HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone who loves a good survival game, and is interested in watching it grow over time.","January 14","true","88.4"," 40 of 46 people (87%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","87","40","46","5","0"

Well, we need to change a couple of things here. First of all, your appearance is…. Shall we say a little bit frail and you will appear practically naked, not in Los Angeles but in the outback of HURTWORLD!!\n\nHurtworld is a multiplayer survival FPS game with a large open world. As you spawn for the first time in your birthday suit, you will need to gather and hunt for very important resources straight away.  Collect wood and stone by picking them up or by mining (different types of stones/rocks) and make sure you accumulate enough foods to survive another day. You might be lucky enough to find seeds and become a farmer (that depends of your life spend)! The days can be sweet, hunting animals, making friends and developing your arsenal, from spears to machine guns. The days can go sour, you can still be running around with nothing on and the weather can change from beautiful sunshine to rain and you are going to get soaked; plus night time is just around the corner and you will feel the cold to the point of dying of hypothermia!\n\nThe servers can hold up to 50 players and most players seem to be friendly. I have a particular recollection of being at a fire pit trying to keep warm when this guy was coming towards me and saying over his microphone that he was friendly and he did not mean any harm. He even invited me to be part of his group. “Great,” I thought. So I went through the menu to find out which key I was supposed to use to respond but…. I received a strange gift from him… it was an arrow straight to my poor and frail body. Then he scavenged from my dead body and his next words were, ”Wow, plenty of goodies here!” What a little bugger, I thought! Anyway, his offer of joining was genuine but I could not find where he was squatting!\n\nThis game is all about the evolution of your character and you really have to be on the ball to be able to survive to the next day. Find a workbench (or create one) and you will be able to craft plenty of items; materials - weapons - tools – gears - machines and more. If you fancy a spot at the edge of a cliff, just take ownership of the land and build your shelter there!\n\nGraphically the game looks great and runs very well. From the control point of view you will use the keyboard and mouse in this game.\n\nPositive:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Big open world\n-	Plenty of ting to craft and build\n-	Changeable weather\n-	Servers hold up to 50 players\n-	Hardcore survival game\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	Occasional animals glitches (you see them from a distance but as you get closer their disappear\n-	No achievements / trading cards\n\nThis is a great survival game with plenty of crafting to do! If you are a fan of this type of game, you must come and visit Hurtworld. I know you will love it!\n\n8.5/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

Bare in mind I do not know much about it this is the take on it so far.\n\nPros:\n- Has vehicles\n- Can craft guns\n- Toon shaders are nice they are clean and simple\n- Good choice of crafting you can even craft a quadbike,\n- Different survival elements really do matter from freezing to being to hot hunger, even infamous for killing.\n- UI is nice clean and simple nothing to complicated\n- Can do sexy dance\n- Emotes are awesome from the sticking the finger up to the sexy dance. There isn't a whole lot of them but they are great.\n- Has Voip soundboards can be fun\n- Very nice weather effects with the sand dust being blown through in the wind being an example (haven't got out of the desert biome yet)\n- First and Third person cameras using F2.\n- Has Day Night Cycle, at night you want a campfire or proper clothing\n- Has animals got headbutted by a baby deer thing its so cute (although lack of animations)\n- Throwing spears or poking with spear switch modes by pressing R.\n- Has Bows\n- Plenty of stuff to mine\n- Has building\n- The animations that are in now look pretty good especially the emotes\n- Runs pretty well on the fps most of the time does not need a beast expensive computer to be enjoyed\n- Dev Blog on the main menu screen so you can read it for updates\n- Plenty of graphics options in a simple format (Lack of borderless windowed choice though at the moment)\n\nBad:\n- The lack of ♥♥♥♥♥ you start off with shorts. Not sure if there is a censor command.\n- No female variations for the character you play at the moment. Its just a dude with a furry beard\n- Boar health - damage makes no ♥♥♥♥ing sense.. after hitting 4 times and having another player attack it, the ♥♥♥♥ing thing still running around headbutting people killing them in 3 hits if that.. ♥♥♥♥ing annoying because you try to hit it and it doesnt ♥♥♥♥ing register you hit the floor through the boar instead..\n- Campfire requires a bit too much wood imo hard to get when there is a lot of players in the same area\n- Day night cycle is too quick,\n- Very quick to get to hunger and starve to death\n- Rabbits are the main thing you come across but the hunting isn't quite there yet, they will run away at any distance if not just simply despawn. (They are a pain)\n- Lack of animals around in an area\n- The spawning system, needs to let players spawn all over the world to stop the spawn get killed by dude with spears a few seconds later thing. It is kind of annoying\n- Servers have a lot of lag happen so voip can sound weird and people stuttering\n- Lack of bordlerless windowed mode, for people with multiple screens it will probably annoy you\n- You don't get wood from most trees you get it from logs you find, you hit big logs for more wood and pick up little ones for less wood. There is the dead trees further out you can hit with your axe to get wood from but that is it so far mind you the wood spawn rate is pretty good so far and hasn't been too much of a problem when you get away from the main starting area where all the players are.\n- F**k*ng annoying to die and have to scrounge for loot again. Its like your a complete pu55y on this game you take so much damage. Why? Got headbutted by a pig does more damage than something spitting green steamy balls at me..\n\nOther Stuff to consider:\n\n- Says its been in development for about 18 months so far, it is indeed a very early product but so far it is pretty good though the server looks like it struggles a bit at times (probably be improved down the line)\n- Survival game lots of players = lots of kos A holes\n\nTo me its sort of like Rust meets The Long Dark its pretty well done too and for the short time its been in devolpment it is great. Its fun, frustrating and funny, and will pi55 you off and make you say F**k a lot..  Please keep in mind the bad points could be changed at any time this is just what it is so far.","December 4, 2015","true","42.2"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","19","24","2","0"

Release Date: 19 December 2015.\n\nThis is literally the first Early Access game I can consider good and playable and I have seen a fair share of them.\n\nThe game is fun, it's meant to have interaction with other players etc so PvP and perhaps even PvE can be done.\n\nThe game performs very well even on avarage hardware, 60 FPS is a must and minimum for any game and this game delivers it.\nAs this is Early Access there is little content available and it took me and my friend less than a day to get all the best gear, items, cars etc in the game and build a nice looking bases as well, but this is completely understandable and expected.\nWe played on a Community Hosted Server which is a great addition and hopefully as the game gets more popular, more and more of Community Hosted servers get more players in them. As of currently, most of them are basically empty.\nThe game has very flexible modding support which I personally believe is also a must in any game because that provides potentially evergrowing new content support.\n\nWhile we played it with my friend, we found suprisingly few bugs, most of them were graphical glitches which do not affect gameplay much at all and the few game bugs we found are very small ones.\n\nThe only worries that are present are the ones which you get on any Early Access Game: Hopefully the game development continues at a decent speed (new content gets added, new features etc) and performance of the game won't downgrade over time. So shoutout to Developers: Do NOT back off from this game, finish it, it has great potential!\n\nWould I recommend to play the game in the current state? Yes, it is fun, even with the little content it has to offer right now. This game can potentially be extremely popular especially if the performance factor can be held, both Client and Server side.\n","January 3","true","35.5"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

I am not one of the fools trying to stop EA games. The EA system is a great idea, and works very well most of the time, so on to the game.\nThe game itself has a good concept. It’s not “Totally new and different! A whole new type of game!” but it is fun, and unique. So why the downvote?\n* I love PVP games. I love H1Z1 with perma death and losing all yer stuff to a noob who shot you with a bow. That’s fun. But this is different. It’s a game with a deep crafting system. To make a gun takes a long time, lots of work and it’s satisfying. That is till they made the update where you drop everything when you die. Now you get killed left and right, and STILL, have to work forever to make anything. At that point it turns into a war.\n*The only way this would Work “well” (Or really at all) would be to have clans, where you could build up yer stuff in a safe place and have wars. That could be fun, but it would kill it for solo players such as I. If yer a solo player this game seems beyond hope, I’d turn away.\n*Now what if you want to be a clan player. Cool! Try and find someone. The servers AREN'T low pop, but the players are toxic at best. One time I saw a guy murdered (BEFORE the loot drop update). He asks the player WHY. The player says “You took my log”. FYI logs spawn regularly. EVERYWHERE. This was a top lvl player. He killed a noob. Said the guy stole his family, and then refused to give anyone of the dudes stuff back.\n*TL;DR Yeah the community is toxic and this game has now been set up in a way that it would only work with a GREAT community helping everyone out. The devs started off good with a good idea, but they screwed up. The gmae is NOT pointless, you still may like it. And it may come back maybe they'll fic the mistakes. I really have put enough into this game to fairly judge, so I may update in time.\nP.S.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Socknic/recommended/393420/","Socknic","Socknic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Socknic/","69 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAt first glance, Hurtworld appears to be another cheap addition to Steam's already massive collection of Early Access survival games. Initially, I didn't pay it much mind, assuming that it would be quickly abandoned, like many other similar titles. However, after watching a few gameplay videos, Hurtworld caught my interest.\n\nWhile I'll agree that Hurtworld's lack of originality is somewhat offputting, I believe it is fair to say that it is borrowing from the right places. It plays very similarly to Rust, another great survival game, but with tighter controls and combat mechanics. To put it simply, it feels like a refined first person shooter with major survival elements, whereas games like Rust are focused primarily on survival with the addition of slightly loose gun-based combat.\n\nMoving to Hurtworld's surprisingly large roster of features, all the action takes place on a relatively small map. Those who have played the Legacy version of Rust will feel right at home in the derelict setting of Hurtworld. The map is host to several varied biomes, each of which holds a multitude of resources and threats, meaning that select points on the map become highly contested hot spots. When you begin playing Hurtworld, you find yourself in a dry and dusty area, with a scattering of trees and rocks. Through the gathering of materials from resource nodes, you will be able to craft tools which will aid you in your journey. Unlike Rust, Hurtworld's equipment system is split more precisely into item tiers, similar to those find in other games such as Minecraft and Terraria. Whether this is good or bad is up to you, however, I tend to prefer a more vague approach in survival titles. I could ramble on and on about Hurtworld's features, including their merits and flaws, so I will focus more on what is perhaps the game's most unique aspect, the infamy system. This system is designed to deter players, mainly those with guns and powerful gear, from killing newly spawned or truly friendly players. Killing players temporarily adds to your infamy bar. The more people you slay, the more your infamy status increases. Reaching certain levels of infamy will cause you to drop some of your valuable gear on death, something which normally does not happen. However, if you by some chance end up gaining infamy, all hope is not lost, as it will decay over time. While the infamy system is certainly an interesting mechanic which creates more player interaction and makes early game life easier, I feel it also has some serious negative impact. The most glaring problem is that killing players for their guns and clothing, among other valuable gear, is entirely pointless if they have no infamy. Further more, it will add to your infamy bar, putting you at a temporary disadvantage. Admittedly, it's kind of odd that a system which removes much of the risk from dying is in place in a game that advertises itself as being hardcore, but I digress. The infamy system, along with a diverse cast of dangerous creatures which roam the map, puts the environment at a similar threat level as other players. While it's refreshing to see PvE at full strength in a PvP game, I feel this is partially due to an absurd amount of animal spawns, and would love to see some sort of change to the infamy system which would allow for more combat between survivors.\n\nAesthetically, Hurtworld is a decent looking game, though I can't say I'm a particularly big fan of the game's graphical style. The simplified art works wonders for optimization, putting it miles ahead of many Early Access survival titles in that regard. There is no music to be found, however, there are plenty of sound effects, most of which are crunchy and satisfying.\n\nIf you didn't already see this coming, I legitimately feel that Hurtworld is a diamond in the rough. While the game has not been in development for very long, and has its fair share of bugs and issues, there is plenty of fun to be had. If you are a fan of survival games and do not mind the Early Access program, I would certainly recommend picking up Hurtworld.","December 26, 2015","true","25.5"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","17","21","0","0"

I could not be happier.\n\nOver the last 18 months I have been privileged enough to come through the games development process, from a concept conversation to witnessing the games release.\n\nOver this period, I have been married, moved across the country and seen the birth of my first child. To me, todays release rates as highly as these milestones.\n\nI have seen my best mates give up a stable and comfortable life to chase a dream. A dream which has now come to fruition.\n\nFor this reason, the game is not a simple release which some minor patches. This game will not fail. Its polished, challenging, expansive, vibrant, has a great community and will only get better. Its the love and passion which has been poured in to this game which shines through.\n\nI couldn't be prouder or more inspired by my best mate.\n\nGame on!","December 4, 2015","true","73.6"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","18","23","0","0"

It's still pretty fun but doesn't have a lot of replay value due to how the map is setup. People can camp loot areas with automatic rifles and such and after dying several times are running there for ten minutes is quite annoying. I'd like new maps, or at least new weapons or maybe even an end game objective. I will set this as negative until I see improvement because the game hasn't changed much from when it was released.","May 11","false","79.0"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","19","25","2","0"

The devs have focused on what's important first and that is core game mechanics and stability - The game runs at 60+ FPS without too much effort. Very impressive considering its an early access game. Sure it has glitches and bugs but the devs seem active enough. Once you have all the best gear, there isn't much else to do, however there are new content on the way.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/calmrotini/recommended/393420/","calmrotini","Rice","http://steamcommunity.com/id/calmrotini/","70 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nHurtworld is a cool new game where your objective is to survive in unforgiving environments. Seriously unforgiving.\n\nAt the moment the game is in alpha, and yet I haven't encountered any bugs, which is very uncommon for an alpha game. Also, the interface for this game is great. It's easy to navigate making crafting and all of those things enjoyable.\n\nSo far my only problem has been the lag, and no, it's not my internet's fault. It's quite common to see in the chat something like "this lag though" or "anyone else lagging?" which is quite frustrating, but I guess it's acceptable for an alpha game.\n\nAlso, if you're a casual gamer going into this game expecting a nice, lovely, calm, and relaxing game then you are probably not going to have a great time. As the game description states itself, "Hurtworld is a hardcore multiplayer survival FPS with a focus on deep survival progression that doesn't become trivial once you establish some basic needs. Built for hardcore gamers, Hurtworld aims to punish."\n\nSo far I believe there are 4 biomes to explore, and every server is set on the same small map. Servers have a player limit of 50, and when 50 players are all running around in the same small map you will come across a few lone individuals or groups of people fairly often.\n\nFrom my experience so far, hunger has been the main problem. And when you're starting out, it can be a real pain killing animals for food. Alongside this, temperature is also a very big problem when starting out. Although, I got slightly bothered when I did from hypothermia in the middle of the day. In a desert. like seriously wtf\n\nThat's really all I have to say about the game so far, I'm sure there are many better reviews than my own out there so go check those out, as they probably do a hell of a lot better at explaining things than I did. But overall, in the game's current stage, I'm probably going to give it an 8/10, which is pretty darn good for a game that was released 11 days ago as an alpha.","December 14, 2015","true","4.0"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","9","11","2","3"

It might take a while till you find a server which suits your needs.\n\nKeep in mind that if you are on a community server asking an admin for help or if the server offers free stuff like a car, the admin will mostlikely teleport to you. If you kill him and take his stuff, don't be surprised to be punished AND don't you dare calling this "admin abuse". If you are stupid enough to kill an admin who is just trying to help you, you deserve to be punished.\n\nThere are still some bugs like mobs glitching through walls ( place an additional wall around your base to block them off entirely ) or the memory leak of the server itself, but thats not a big deal since you can restart the server easily with a script.\n\nCar / Quad chassis spawn near containers / big houses and are missing most of the parts so u'll have to find wheels, engine, gearbox and gasoline first ( gasoline can be crafted, everything else u'll get from chassis / crates ).\nCars / Quads can be customized with paint & designs and you will be able to place differents parts on your car in the future.\n\nI'd recommend this game to any player who likes to play survival games.","December 19, 2015","true","134.3"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","10","13","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sculptor/recommended/393420/","sculptor","sculptor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sculptor/","374 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n[WIP] The review will change with content updates.\n\nReviewed patch: December 26, 2015 - Patch 0.3.2.5\n\nGameplay\nThe premise of the game is quite simple: survive and build. The game does implement both of them quite well. You are surviving from both human players and the environment. While you can probably live with a campfire and hunt animals for food, you won't be able to survive for long against human players. For that you need to build houses. How grand and elaborate the buildings are is entirely up to you. You can make a small shack with a few necessesary items in it or a sprawling multi-storey mansion with a garage or even a fortress. It's limited by your imagination.\n\nEnvironment\nThe game map is quite large and they might add more to it in the future. The map is made up of six different biomes, five of them are habitable and one is a radiation zone. Each biome works differently depending on the type of biome it is. If you go to the dunes without sun screen and light clothing, you will get heatstroke and die before long unless you find shelter. Similarly if you go to the snow biome without winter wear and food, you will die of hypothermia or hunger. The game's environment plays a big role in the type of gear you need with you at any time.\n\nI have probably spent most of my game time on the snow biome so I will comment on my personal experiences there. First of all it's absulutely beautiful. There is something about getting on a snow covered hill and looking at the horizon to see white covered trees, plains and mountains and the moon shining brightly from the sky, not an animal or human in sight. It's erily quite and peaceful, and lonely (if you are alone). That's what snow biome offers, isolation. You will not get many animals to hunt for food, and unless appropriately clothed, you will start to catch cold. You need to make a fire to stay warm. If it starts to rain, even proper clothing won't help you, you need to make a shelter. Add the fact that high level ores which are used for pretty much everything, are scattered around randomely and they are radioactive or poisonous (depending on the ore). It is very tough to survive without proper preparation as it should be. The game's environment is deadly and with preparation, manageable but to the unprepared it can end in an untimely demise.\n\nEnemies\nThe game has small variety of creatures. Most drop meat which is the best food you can get right now and the rest are a bit more tougher and give more exotic materials when killed. The bigger enemy are the other players. The game has a partial loot system. Which means, unless you are infamous (bounty system for killing players), you will keep your worn items and tools but drop all resources so you are not back to square one if you die. You can find players who will try to kill you for your resources and players who will give you some food and send you on your way and even players who might ask you if you want to join them. Playing with other people increases the survivability and makes the game more fun, but it is definately playable alone.\n\nAnd if you don't fancy pitting it against other players, there are PVE servers where players are forbidden from killing other players. Those servers are recommended if you are new to survible games or just starting out as a new player.\n\nReplayability\nIf you like building things, you can easily spend 100+ hours in the game just collecting resources and making buildings without restriction. You are only limited by the space where you build (unless you chose to go vertical) and your imagination.\n\nThe game is lacking in content in terms of craftable items though. It's quite easy to make all the items you need within a few days. To keep playing you can spend the rest of the your days building, exploring, killing other players, looking for car parts etc..\n\nFinal thoughts\nRight now the game is very playable in terms of smoothness. There is an issue with nvidia and a bug with the game engine but there is a simple fix  and there are guides on the hub to fix it. What the game lacks right now is content. The game lacks enemy varieties and craftable items. The developers took a small break during the winter holidays and hopefully they are back to creating new content for us. As the game stands today, you can definately get your moneys worth in game time already from the amount of conent you can experience right now.\n\nIf you are a fan of building things or survival genre, this game is highly recommended. And if you are new to the survival genre, this is not a bad place to start. There are no zombies in this game, but unlike many popular zombie survivale games, the environment can be just as deadly as humans in this game.","January 4","true","86.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

I not big on survival simulations, but this game has to be the best I have ever played to date. Now since this game is still in Early Access, there are some bugs. The biggest bug is fall damage. There has been countless times when I would be climbing a rock and almost die for no reason. Now that aside I talk about the pros and cons of this game.\n\nPROS:\n\n1. The developers recommend the players to be nice and not to kill. If you kill you gain infamy and this makes it easier to lose the most valuable items you have.\n\n2. The community is very positive, the first time I played, a random player gave me spare clothes. (There has been some times i have seen killing but its very rare).\n\n3. The graphics are amazing for an Early Access game (not saying that every Early Access game has bad graphics).\n\nNow for the Cons:\n\n1. The game crashes too many times on my pc but after 3 crashes, the game works again.\n\n2. Like I already said, the fall damage is a buggy. (this could change later on).\n\n3. Its a little easy after you get a base set and it gets a little repetative after a while. (I have only explored spawn and not the other biomes so...).\n\nFor my over all rating for this game I will give this game 8.5/10 and I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes survival based games.","January 5","true","18.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

How to make a better game than Hurtworld:\nStep no.1: You can't.\nStep no.2: You still can't.\nStep no.3: Stop trying... you just can't.\nSeriously.. this game is freakin amazing. I was a huge fan of rust legacy and when that game got changed.. I stopped playing survival games. But then, while browsing steam.. I found this amazing game. It might not have so much content yet... It might still have glitches... bugs.... But man... For a game that was oficially released about 1 month ago... I'd say.. That these devs are doing an amazing job. I haven't encountered any problem with hackers yet, altho some servers kinda restart when you dont expect.. but thats not a problem cause it usually takes only 5 mins max to fully restart.\nSo, good graphics, good gameplay, lots of fun... I'd say this game could easily be the best survival game. At first its a bit hard... You might just get spawn killed for 2 hours (Wich i totally didnt pffff). But then.. once you get a 1x1 base its getting pretty easy. Go out, gather resources, kill animals, and keep upgrading your base. Then go in search for some friends (always have a shotgun with you... you never know), go in rad towns, loot, get a car, start a war with a group of players and lose everything... To be honest.. it doesnt matter if you win or lose... in this game.. you will always have fun if you respect some rules:\nRule no.1:"I am friendly" is almost always a lie.\nRule no.2:Always have a gun with you.\nAnd rule no.3:Hunt or be hunted:)\nJust one last tip:\nBUY THIS GAME!","January 6","true","104.8"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","1"

When I first logged into the game I had literally no idea what I was doing, i ran around for awhile picking up really anything i could find, rocks, sticks, etc. they need to add a tutorial for beginners because the game can be really hard at times, especially for noobs! the game is very immersive and it actually feels like you are the in the game. i see a lot of people complaining because the game doesn't have much in it, do not get put off by these reviews! the game is still in early access! which means they are not finished yet, they will still be adding stuff into it! The game is a very enjoyable experience with friends but is a little overpriced for what it is at the moment, make sure to buy the game when its on sale because then you will be getting your moneys worth out of it!\n\n- Zenqi 7/10","May 18","true","45.9"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","10","15","2","0"

Only buy if you plan on dealing with a bad community like Rust's for example or if you want to play SP, which means you gotta set up servers and stuff.\n\nPOSITIVES:\n*Cute graphics.\n\n*Difficulty\n\n*Map is cool\n\n*Cool creatures to face.\n\n*Cool creature system. You start off seeing bunnies and such, but the deeper inland you go the bigger they get.\n\n*Community can be fun at times.\n\nNEGITIVES:\n*Problems here and there with FPS. A lot of people talk about how fps can suck at times.\n\n*Server wipes. Although, this being an early access game, it's kinda expected. Just really hard to get stuff in the first place.\n\n*Glitchy. The creatures will sometimes just sit there and let you kill them, or run in place. I have really good internet, so it can't be because of my connection.\n\n*Vehicles are tough to find. I get it, it's  Hurtworld. It's not supposed to be easy. But why are vehicles so hard to find?\n\n*Community can be toxic a lot. I know there are some good times with the community, but most of the time you get people from Rust who are always shouting racial slurs, killing people who just spawned, and not to mention there are hackers. I'm not screaming aimbot like some kid who just got killed 5 times by the same guy, but rather it's people flying that I have seen a few times. Ofcourse, the game is a lot like Rust, so this doesn't really suprise me.\n\n\nOverall I reccomend for people looking for SP or people who enjoyed Rust despite the toxic community. This game, at the time being, is a 6/10 from me. Although, i'll probably not play it for a while. I'll wait for some more patches and stuff.","December 6, 2015","true","5.1"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","12","19","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Skiru/recommended/393420/","Skiru","Skiru","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Skiru/","231 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAt first glance, Hurtworld appears to be another cheap addition to Steam's already massive collection of Early Access survival games. Initially, I didn't pay it much mind, assuming that it would be quickly abandoned, like many other similar titles. However, after watching a few gameplay videos, Hurtworld caught my interest.\n\nWhile I'll agree that Hurtworld's lack of originality is somewhat offputting, I believe it is fair to say that it is borrowing from the right places. It plays very similarly to Rust, another great survival game, but with tighter controls and combat mechanics. To put it simply, it feels like a refined first person shooter with major survival elements, whereas games like Rust are focused primarily on survival with the addition of slightly loose gun-based combat.\n\nAesthetically, Hurtworld is a decent looking game, though I can't say I'm a particularly big fan of the game's graphical style. The simplified art works wonders for optimization, putting it miles ahead of many Early Access survival titles in that regard. There is no music to be found, however, there are plenty of sound effects, most of which are crunchy and satisfying.\n\nIf you didn't already see this coming, I legitimately feel that Hurtworld is a diamond in the rough. While the game has not been in development for very long, and has its fair share of bugs and issues, there is plenty of fun to be had. If you are a fan of survival games and do not mind the Early Access program, I would certainly recommend picking up Hurtworld.","December 29, 2015","true","184.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

I don't shop around for too many games, but just like a lot of Alpha games that interest me, I think this one is going to stick.\n\nIf you are just picking this game up, expect it to be a grind in the beginning. Might be a little frustrating starting off but once you stick a good spawn/run you'll fall in love with the game over time.\n\nThe nice feature is that though it is a survival, it still allows you the opportunity for progression. You create tools which stay with you through death so you can start back off semi-comfortably, with the ability to spawn in your base toward mid to late game.\n\nI love how killing other players carries the burden of potentially losing your items within a certain cooldown point, but I don't think that eliminates a good purge/bloodshed to seasoned players who have gained access to built storage units and bases. This can be tough for people who are just starting out as you do shed somewhat hard to come by resources if you're doing your best to throw together progression.\n\nI think that the game could use a little TLC on building functions as some have exploited ways of securing plots of land with very little expenses, this could be a burden if you can't secure an area because of a floating platform above your head.\n\nPRO:\n-Gentle on graphics (though some might struggle with rain, though turning off luxury settings such as bloom/motion blur might fix this)\n-keeping crucial items such as tools/weapons/bags/clothing\n-The construction feature/menu is user-friendly allowing the not so talent to create beautiful structures\n-More relying on hunting and less on scavanging for food\n-Life necessities are tolerable (not having to deal with sore feet, bum knee, bad back, thirst)\n-health UI is easy to read/manage\n\nCON:\n-Requirements of certain items can definitely be a grind\n-No unarmed melee which leaves you defenseless when you are just starting out\n-Just not enough resource spawns (maybe it is just me and it's reaching all out for hardcore survival, but in the end it is a game\n-No Free-Look ability (this is huge for some as this is a feature contained in many games, not having it is definitely a step back)\n-Nothing to benefit a moveable/reusable fire source for your average Nomad.\n\nIn the end you can see some of the CON's are luxury which might be brought in at a later time, I am content with where the game is right now.. It only goes to show through continued development and support, the sky is the limit.\n\nI think I'm going to stick with this and see where it goes.\n\nPlease... For the love of God, add Free-Look.","December 16, 2015","true","13.2"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","7","10","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JamesClydesdale/recommended/393420/","JamesClydesdale","James Clydesdale","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JamesClydesdale/","94 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game is a lot like Rust, except it has a playerbase that is thriving, and I think it's partially due to the friendliness of the entire game. This is honestly the first game that has Russians who won't kill on site, and the infamy system is great, all though it needs some tweaks.\n\nWith the infamy system, you get infamy for killing a player, and it generally lasts for 15 minutes per kill. However, regardless of who provokes the fight, the person who ends victorious will always get infamy. Basically, if I shoot you first, and you end up killing me, you get infamy and I get out scot free. If you die in this game, with no infamy, you drop nothing besides raw materials, which is basically anything that isn't clothes or crafted weapons. But if you are infamous when you die, you drop everything and you start from scratch. It's basically a reason to try to avoid killing as much as possible, resulting in the entire friendly atmosphere the game got.\n\nOver all, I enjoy the game, and I feel as if people should give it a shot. It's very similar to Rust, except there is never a single person or group that dominates the server. No longer will you be killed by the top dogs of the server, but by only the elements and the vicious animals, and occasionally, people, who you have a chance to beat. This game will result in fantastic memories with friends and friendly people, and friends are to be made within the vast map of Hurtworld.\n\nEDIT:\nThe only downside to this game is that, due to its early state, official servers will be often wiped to remove all old bases, and give new people a chance to dominate the server. So, a lot of wipes, and a lot of hacking. All though this game has people who hack, it's not an epidemic. Hacking can be fixed, it's just a matter of time. I bet 3 months from now, there will be less wipes, less hacks, and new items and updates to come. Greatest survival game I've ever played, I'd dare to say it's even better than Rust.","December 12, 2015","true","130.7"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

It takes a lot of elements from legacy rust but does it better in some way. Gameplay is solid, no lags for me and its quite noob friendly since it has an infamy system which makes you drop more loot on death if you kill more players, therefore making it unattractive to kill new players. Its also easy to set up a private server using SteamCMD if you want to learn the game on your own before you jump in the online PvP action. I recommend this game to anyone who likes survival PvP games and some nice co-op action (Its a lot more fun if you play with a friend or friends). Devs are talking about a PvE setting for servers, so if you don't like PvP that much I would wait for PvE to come out first. Or you could always create a private server for you and your friends.","December 6, 2015","true","23.0"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deadlydag/recommended/393420/","deadlydag","DeadlyDag","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deadlydag/","793 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n** DISCLAIMER: This is based upon the Early Access, and extremely early at that one as well **\n\nI've been craving a good survival-game for some time, because H1Z1, DayZ nor Arma 3: DayZ or Rust manages to fill my need for it, even though Rust are the closest at the moment.\n\nWe have gotten a huge ocean of survival \ crafting-games the past two years after the rising of the DayZ-mod.\nPeople like it. People enjoy it. I like it. I enjoy it.\nBut after a while, all these tedious games kept popping up like candy, and while many of them barely touched the surface, some made it to the top, and are still staying there, even with the lack of content and quality it should have.\n\nIf a new survival game was to surface, it will need something special. Something extra. Something to make it stand out.\nSubnautica for example. It's just another survival game. But it's under water. And it does it pretty well even without coop or multiplayer.\n\nBut, with this in mind, I just thought "Meh, I'll try it out", and while the game looks promising, the visuals and the devs seem to be up to pair with most of it.\n\nI played a total of 2 hours (1.9, since I did not want to surpass the refund-possibility)\n\nWhile the game looks nice enough with a slight Rust-feeling to it (Unity?),\nI just can't say that the price is worth the content.\n\nThere's nothing to do really, except to gather resources to build a house and a few weapons.\nI'm assuming this will change, but not as of yet.\nIt's extremely shallow at the moment. As are most of the survival games out there. H1Z1 comes to mind.\n\nYes, it might have promise, and yes, it might have good thoughts,\nbut 136 NOK (~$15) does not justify the content and\or game at all in this state. This was with a slight discount as well.\n\nPersonally I think they should drop 50% off the price while in Early Access, and then up it when they bring some real content to it.\nOr even waited a few months before getting it into EA.\n\nThe difficulty I do like, and I do like the aesthetics. No, I adore the aesthetics actually. They're very pleasing. Reminds me a bit of The Long Dark. I loved finding small deer and rabbits jumping around to hunt for.\nI really did. But that was one of the few things I enjoyed with it.\n\nThere's not much to craft (yet), and there's not much to explore.\nI'm sure they will implement it, but that's the case for my review:\nNOT YET!\n\nWill I recommend the game in it's current state? - No. Not with that pricetag at this time.\n\nWill I come back to see how it progresses further? - Absolutely. It shows good promise, and I would love to see a decent survival game shine.\n\nI would love to see more EA developers use a lower price-tag when in very early stages of EA.\n50% off for example.\nAdding more stuff to the game? Up it a notch. 40% off. Closing up to release? Only 10% off to make the last people jump on board to get that little discount before the release.\n\nThe main reason for me saying 'nay' to Hurtworld at the moment is primarily to the price-tag for offered content. Not because the lack of quality. I do like what I see, but it's just lacking to make up for the price.\n\nIf you do pick it up though, you'll most likely spend 10-20 hours before you grow tired,\nand then you'll come back now and then to check it out. Just as with any other survival game we have. That's what we do. That's how it works.\n\nWe need something to change all that. Might that be Hurtworld? - Perhaps. But not yet.\n\nTL;DR: Looking for that new special survival game? This is not it - Yet.\nWant to know if you should spend $15 on this? - Don't do it unless you're absolutely sure that you want to pay for a game that's very shallow in it's current state.\nAgain: The aesthetics are very pleasing.\n\nEdit: Commented back on a few comments in the comment-section. You know.. For comments.","December 7, 2015","false","15.3"," 210 of 405 people (52%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","52","210","405","11","30"

Let me know what you think!\n\nAs far as my opinion on the game goes, it is definitely worth the money! It's still in a very early developmental stage so some things are quirky, or downright broken, but this is to be expected!

Scour the valleys around you for resources to craft better equipment, clothes and weapons rambo'ing all that dare challenge you (or run away to safety, your call). Build a simple house and stake your claim to your bit of land before planning out your next excursion for the resources to make better gear you will need to survive for longer and longer. Farm animals and fruit to keep from starving, heat your weathered bones with campfires, firepits and eventually even a blast furnace. Explore a surpirsingly big map with diverse biomes each holding new challenges from extreme desert to freezing snow valleys. Find abandoned towns and loot for rare items whilst always keeping an eye out for others, those pesky others. Build up your base and add traps, drilling equipment and more to make harvesting the best resources a little easier, then go out geared up to destroy all who cross you only to be bonked on the head by a sneaky naked with a flint hatchet!","February 8","true","218.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

What makes a game like this either thrive or die is the community around it and the community around this game for the english speaking folk like myself is just god awful.\n\nI tried giving the game another go just the other day was greeted by many russians chinese and a few italians none of which could speak english. Bare in mind i was in a featured community server i did try a couple other servers but closest to a US base server i could find was split [EU/US] any thing else either had no players or had insane rates.\n\nTrying to have a conversation was like speaking to a brick wall and trying to find people to play with was even more impossible. The game it's self doesn't seem to have changed much since when i bought it except now theres a build limit which is kind of lame.\n\nAnyway stay away there are other survival games out there with more content and better communities.\n\nThey have added steamworkshop to this game but it only seems to have low-quality maps on it as of right now maybe check back in a year see how the game is then but as of right now i cant recomend it.","June 3","false","194.6"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

Started on a new server and immediately meet up with a guy I don't know. We start surviving together and end up using Teamspeak to communicate. We die multiple times but end up finding a blown out base with all of the equipment to get geared. While staying at this place a group come along and try to kill me, but they got rekt in the end. My new friend and I end up grabbing all of our stuff and heading out to the rich land of winter. While on our escapade we start freezing to death and with no materials to make a fire. In the distance we see a base with a fire and end up running there for our lives. These kind people cautiously let us in to huddle around their fire (Had dynamite ready to throw in if they did not let us in), and when the sun rose my new friend and I went off on our adventure. Our adventure led us to the mountains of winter, where we found a poor fellow who had hollowed out a base. My new friend seeing he had no roof jumped in and killed him. Our adventures now had gifted us with a new base that we've re-construced into a mega base. This game is great, and has only just begun in Alpha; I can't imagine what the developers will throw in next.\n\nTL;DR: Always put a roof on your house or a white guy will jump in and kill you.","December 9, 2015","true","12.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","3","4","2","1"

Started on a new server and immediately meet up with a guy I don't know. We start surviving together and end up using Teamspeak to communicate. We die multiple times but end up finding a blown out base with all of the equipment to get geared. While staying at this place a group come along and try to kill me, but they got rekt in the end. My new friend and I end up grabbing all of our stuff and heading out to the rich land of winter. While on our escapade we start freezing to death and with no materials to make a fire. In the distance we see a base with a fire and end up running there for our lives. These kind people cautiously let us in to huddle around their fire (Had dynamite ready to throw in if they did not let us in), and when the sun rose my new friend and I went off on our adventure. Our adventure led us to the mountains of winter, where we found a poor fellow who had hollowed out a base. My new friend seeing he had no roof jumped in and killed him. Our adventures now had gifted us with a new base that we've re-construced into a mega base.

This game is pretty fantastic for being in early access, and it's super addicting. So far I've built a base with some friends, got some weapons, did some raids on a guy who killed us when we started fresh, nearly lost my girl friend, stopped hanging out with my RL friends, destroyed my sleep schedule, and pondered finishing college. Sad yes, but if that doesn't tell you that you should probably buy this game then I'm not sure what will.\n\nThis game has interesting graphics, helps others who can't afford super computers for games like Ark be able to play. Gameplay is pretty smooth, and even once you know where everything is it can still be a challenge to obtain specific items. I personally don't have any game-breaking problems, maybe very little latency issues, but other than that the devs have stated they want to fix current bugs before adding more features to the game, which is a good thing im my opinion.

And it actually has VEHICLES! (only like 2)\nBut there are a LOT of glitches to fix.\nFor example, animals often walk through walls and attack you through your house.\nAnd you get heatstrokes when near a fire, either though if the fire is outside NEXT to a house that your in, you still get heatstrokes which is quite annoying, and the only way to survive heatstrokes is to run away from the fire and there is NO cooling system. I admit, there are a ton of bugs that are quite annoying, and good servers are also hard to find.\nBut the good sort of out weighs the good. I reccomend this game, but I'd suggest probably suggest you wait till the bugs are fixed.

I know that I do not have very much playtime compared to some of the other reviewers, but I find this game extremely fun. It is relatively bug-free, and it is fairly easy to find an occupied server to connect to. There does seem to be a drop in the amount of official servers recently, but there are plenty of great community servers as well. I have yet to find any hackers, and this game has a very friendly community, especially when compared to other survival games, where you are guaranteed to be killed on sight, no matter what. There is an ever-expanding base building system that always seems to improve, allowing for more unique bases, and I find that extremely fun, as it gives players a reason to create bases that are nearly impossible to raid, yet it is also fun to try to find a way to raid differently designed bases. While this game is not completely perfect, it is still in Alpha, so I feel that it is deserving of an 8/10 for now.","May 26","true","8.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Then after an hour I want to adventure i adventure into the pine tree biome. (I don't know the name of it) When I get there I meet this friendly man it seemed he only muttered small english words like come, stay, eat, etc. very small words but I soon trust him he takes me into his house and then I see it's unfinished, so I say I can help you and he swears some words into his mic (Of some other language) that I don't understand. He then screams and yells and pulls a bow out I soon panic and run around his base he then catches up to me and says bye *psh* I'm struck by  an arrow in the head..In anger I rage quit.\n\nPART 2\n\nI then go on to a sydney server I spawn gather wood and flint made a flint axe I then run into a fellow player he doesn't talk I continue to communicate to him no voice or typing I then stab him to dead and laugh at the ragdoll effect. *Psh*a arrow misses me by very very little and I see it fly by my face. I then zig zag like I'm crazy go up to where the guy was shooting. I then scream "Hahaha you suck ♥♥♥ at shooting dude" he looks at me. We stare for moments then he puts his head down and said he was using me as target practice we then chat I say do you want to join my army he denies and says "I'm in a clan" I then ask to join he says you have to talk to my leader HITLER....I then follow him to his base we meet the mighty australian hitler and I join his clan. We then have nice adventures togethe we made houses for noobs with materials WE gathered nobody else's. We build the houses befriend many people. Then the man danny comes on I notice he has a rifle..A very shiny rifle my eyes widen I'm shocked to see someone with a gun of such beauty. We talk then go on a mining trip to the snow to get materials (10-20 minute walk from our base). We go back then a man aproaches us and says "Do you guys have iron" the mans name was Divine he was with a man that's name broke my ears...BARRY!!! The same man I killed in the beggining. I hold my mighty spear Galiothe up in the air I then swear at the gentlmen and danny replied to them "Yeah we have some do you want to trade" they say yes We ask of the red ore (I forget it's name) but we agreed two stacks for 150 iron. (Yes I know very stupid not asking for a specific number but we needed the ore) He agrees then says he'll be back in 15 minutes he messeges me "I want this to guy by smooth! No shady ♥♥♥♥ and we do it in an open field nobody on the hillside no weapons" I agree he comes back we go in the open field and I drop the iron and barry drops the ore...I then hear divine yell "RUN BARRY RUUUUN" I look in my inventory and see we only got SIX green ore. I pull out my bow and start shooting I yell to the others "COME HERE NOW" they come ask what happen and I say in a mad voice "Nothing.." I then hand the ore to danny he takes it. Hitler keeps asking "What happened dude what happened did we get the stuff" I say "Ask danny". We then go out for materials I go for wood danny stays home and hitler hunts. I go on a killing spree and kill 3 nakeds when I got back I tried opening the door. It was locked....I wondered how could it be locked and I yell many times "Danny, danny, let me in dude let me the ♥♥♥♥ in!!!" He opens the door I say thanks dude I notice in slow motion in my mind danny has his rifle out..I then look at him *BAM* I'm shot in the balls and have fallin on my back. I yell into the mic "why danny whyyyy?!?!?!?!?" *BAM* another gunshot goes and I respawn. Hitler goes back to the base after hunting and tries to open the door he danny opens the door then *BAM* it says in chat that hitlers been killed by danny in shock I rage. I run to the house and hitler comes with another guy we try to break the wall down we spent 10 minutes trying. (you can't break the walls) We soon give up and move into one of the houses we built for the noobs.\n\nPART 3\n\nAfter protesting at danny's new home (our old one) for an hour we then choose to build up our base to the max and get C4 to blow up our old house. After gathering I soon go to bed. When I wake up I turn on my computer and play Hurtworld hitlers still up by drinking red bull for the past 6 hours I've been sleep. I spawn in where I last was here shouting. 4 dudes were outside our house they were yelling at us. I go back in the house to get my arrows then one rushes in while i opened the door I close it and say "Get out dude" he refuses and keeps running in circles he kills hitler. Hitler before he died accidently took the ownership claim out. We 1v1 each other then it ends like my previous server. A arrow to the face. I spawn at regular spawn run to the old base then I see it's gone because they guy must of deleted it and took all our loot..I cared but didn't care hitler then goes off to the snow then builds..not telling where we built but while he was over there I was chilling with danny he makes me a Rifle such as his the beauty it was. I still have it at the time of me writing this. But we soon became friends with danny again and we chill with each other now.\n\nEND (Tells the score this game got)\n\nThis is by far the best survival game to me out there. You can do so much and chill with people at the campfire people will just come up and be like can I be here and warm up. This game has brought non stop joy and fun to me for the past 14 hours I've played so far this game is a amazing 10/10 game and runs so smoothly no frame rate drops amazing performance and overall an actual hardcore survival game I do refer this to many other players buy it now while it's on sale but it's definietly worth it's retail price.","December 12, 2015","true","52.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","4","6","3","3"

From building a giant Gothic style cathedral on a plateau to a sprawling chateu in the desert, the new building system is largely underrated.\n\n-Hurtworld is a highly stylized game, almost TF2 esque. Which means it shouldn't seem dated anytime soon.\n\n-Devs are always in touch with the community they've created.\n\n-The PvE aspect is very much prominent, making it more of a survival against the wilderness and hunger rather than other players. I haven't found many players who KOS in Hurtworld (Sure, you'll come across an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ here and there, but not as many as in other early access survival games).\n\n-Infamous system is great, and makes you think twice before you go hunting your fellow humans.\n\n-There are a handful of bugs you'll find on your journey from start to endgame, but none will come close to ruining your gameplay experience.\n\n-The crafting and sorting/splitting system could use some work, and the mob AI could be (and probably will be) improved.\n\n-In my opinion, Hurtworld is best enjoyed with a group of friends. Playing alone can be a grind but still enjoyable nonetheless.\n\n-Do not take if you are nursing, pregnant, or may become pregnant.\n\n-If you have an erection lasting longer than 4 hours, do not take Hurtworld without some sweet hussies by your side.\n\nHurtworld is definitely heading in the right direction. Most reviews I've seen have been way off point, considering that Hurtworld is not a fully released title. The playerbase has dwindled quite a bit, but you can still enjoy Hurtworld on a handful of very populated servers. Hopefully the Steam store announces Hurtworld's official release, because it's not an experience you'll want to miss.","May 17","true","95.3"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","7","12","0","0"

Spawn, die, spawn, die, spawn, die. This is essentially the formula. The saving grace here that sets Hurtworld apart from Rust and H1Z1 is that you respawn with your tools and weapons you had when you died. This definitely helps, so you arent starting over from scratch every time. At the end of the day however, its simply another kill on sight, spawn and die, rinse and repeat survival game. The worst enemy, as always, are other players who simply do not care. Prepare to die over and over again. Inch a little further, and die again. If you are okay with this, go right ahead. If your'e sick of this formula as I am, sick of a game turning you and others into ruthless killing machines who kill other players and loot them for no reason, then move along.

Initially, I didn't pay it much mind, assuming that it would be quickly abandoned, like many other similar titles. However, after watching a few gameplay videos, Hurtworld caught my interest.\n\nWhile I'll agree that Hurtworld's lack of originality is somewhat offputting, I believe it is fair to say that it is borrowing from the right places. It plays very similarly to Rust, another great survival game, but with tighter controls and combat mechanics. To put it simply, it feels like a refined first person shooter with major survival elements, whereas games like Rust are focused primarily on survival with the addition of  gun-based combat.\n\nMoving to Hurtworld's surprisingly large selection of features, all the action takes place on a relatively small map. Unlike Rust, Hurtworld's equipment system is split more precisely into item tiers, similar to those find in other games such as Minecraft and Terraria.\nAesthetically, Hurtworld is a decent looking game, though I can't say I'm a particularly big fan of the game's graphical style. The simplified art works wonders for optimization, putting it miles ahead of many Early Access survival titles in a sense. There is no music to be found, however, there are plenty of sound effects, most of which are sadly just poor but funny voice acting.","December 29, 2015","true","28.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

This is a throwback in some sense to my experience with the original Savage: The Battle for Newerth, the FPS mechanics and aesthetic of the environment and everything is just-as if not more fresh, especially with the TF2-style cell shading, and the absence of the Zombie Apoc fanservice, which is really what I've been waiting for before jumping on the survival sim bandwagon. The game itself and multi-player is relatively smooth, requires low-system resources, also one of the ideas I've had, have semi-ownable property which can only be destructable with very expensive temporary items, all of this already beautifully implemented.

AHHHH"\n*splat*\n\nAll I was missing was a red poof ball hat.\n\n14/10, would experience devil worshipping critter Christmas again.\n\n\nIt's basically Legacy Rust...  Scroll down a tad for the real review.\n\nBuilding system is pretty well done.  What little I was able to build was easy.\nI like that you retain tools and clothing when you die, but drop gatherables.\n\nThe community is basically trash - pretty much feels like every ♥♥♥♥♥♥ tater from Legacy Rust purchased this.\n\nYou'll die.  A lot, in fact.\n\nEvery time you get close to building something, you'll get killed by a dude in a battle buggy.\nEvery time you get enough wood to build a door, someone will shoot you with a rifle from 100 yards away.\nEvery time you find an iron deposit...  Yup, you guessed it.  Some guy with a quad will run you over immediately.\nEvery time you say, "Yes!   I can finally build a storage box and secure my loot!"...\n\nGuess what?\n\nSome dude will chuck a spear at you as you're using the workbench and get the luckiest headshot ever.\n\n----------REAL REVIEW-----------\nOK, so the game is in Early Access so everything said here can and probably will change.\n\nBuilding system is good, already said that.\n\nThe loot-to-building materials is extremely imbalanced.  Know how in Legacy Rust you could find one wood deposit and build 2-3 walls outta it?  Not here.  One deposit gives you 5-6 logs, 20 logs make 40 planks, and 40 planks make 2 walls,\nDoorways are 20, and DOORS are 100.  Yeah, 100 planks for a door when a wall costs 20...  Like I said, extremely imbalanced.  But I'm SURE that's a typo (Probably meant to be 10 planks for a door).\n\nThe hyper/hypothermia system is sorta broken.  I stood next to a campfire and started getting heat stroke, I walked away from the campfire and did not cool down.  Night fell, my cold meter started going up, and I was still dieing of heat stroke.  Died of heat stroke as I was about to freeze to death.  11/10 would die of freezer burn again.\n\nDon't believe the claims that this "imfamy" system deters KOS.  It doesn't.  It's just like Rust - Soon as someone crafts a gun they immediately travel to the noob spawn zone and start shooting at everyone who might have a log and a few Flint stones on em'.  I actually got killed within 30 seconds of spawning the first time in-game.\n\nOther than this...  Trust no-one, beware of Babe and Bambi (They WILL eff you up!), and don't eat yellow snow.\n","December 30, 2015","true","13.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is... SIMPLY BEAUTIFUL. \\ Similar to RUST //\n\nPROS\n- The game run perfeclty so well on HIGH and LOW computer spec. A laptop can do the job at 30 FPS approx.\n- All the system: Craft, loot, when you die you keep your tools, spawning, map area divided in 4 section I believe etc.\n- Graphic look's: Cartoon. I actually prefer this type of graphic instead of realistic stuff for these games.\n- The fact that you never know when a player/ or raiding group will trap you and destruct your work.\n- PLAYING WITH YOUR FRIENDS IS MAGICAL!\n- Low sized fil on your drive, approx: 1-2Gb.\n- Pretty easy to learn for anyone in a short period of time.\n- Choose your server = Choose your language and style of play. Intense PvP or survival stuff.\n\nCONS (More like things to work on and Idea)\n- When you use a bow, you can get back your arrow on the mob/wall or anything after shooting. Could be implemented!\n- Hard to find your friend, maybe implement a totem friend group thing or a compass friend thing or a group system.\n- Actually a map, crafting map, or something. **Not quite sur if an Item like that exist. I should double check**\n- Maybe delete the flying house and object flying system and create a ULTRA BUNKER thing that can't be destroy or something like that to prevent the flying stuff.\n- Create a GUILD/CREW system for PvPing player and give more importance with the totem (Ownership stake).\n\nSO, guys, you should totally take this game WITHOUT QUESTIONING if you are looking for a game to be played with FRIENDS. In solo, I think this game can be really frustrating but you meet and speak with a tone of player so keep in mind TO ACTIVATE AND DON'T BE SHY TO USE YOUR MICROPHONE or you'll get kill for no reason.

Although there is a limited amount of content the game makes up for it in reliability and optimization, as i have not encountered one bug in my 8 hour play time and get a solid 60 fps. This game has great potential and in my oppinion is a good $20/30 investment.

You read in the description that once you've established yourself, survival is no longer trivial -- that's 100% true. The slightest miscalculation or slip-up could cost me 30 mintues worth of farming resources, or 20 hours of constructing a home. This is one of the only open world, survival games on steam where PVE is more challenging than PVP. If you want a game where you can get geared up, raid, and fight other players in little time, this is not the game for you (H1Z1, DayZ mod, etc).\n\nThe community is great. Sure, there will be many players who aim to kill on sight, in Hurtworld's hardcore environment you can hardly blame them. Though, if you are patient and willing to reason, you will find there are many other players interested in becoming an ally.\n\nVisually the graphics are very appealing. They are sharp and vibrant. This game isn't very demanding so most PCs can run it.\n\nI rate 10/10\n\nEdit: I play on the official New York #6 server. You'll find the same players on the same server if you play often enough.

They made drills slightly less effective which made me happy but further drill nerfing is needed. The other complaint that hasn't been addressed yet is the lack of loot in-game. Sure I understand that C4 needs to be hard to make and I appreciate how hard it is to raid everyone. But I have even gone into loot areas on servers with NOBODY only to find that there was 1 box there and all it contained was 7 bullets. Not to mention that I never see any cars being driven around which means that I'm not the only one having no luck finding fun loot. All in all I have read some things the devs have to say and I really like them. And the best part of all that this game has that makes it a 9/10 is that YOU DON'T LOSE EVERYTHING UPON DEATH!!! Halle♥♥♥♥inglujah. But devs PLEASE do more with infamy, KOS players must be punished and nerfing the effects of infamy isnt helping that cause. I understand that if 1 person is defending himself and takes out a few guys and gets killed by the 4th he should not lose more stuff, but come up with something, I have faith in you.","January 7","true","100.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","5"

The game a lot of materials, craftings and other challenging things in it.\nYou can play on official and community servers with your friends and the game is a PvE PvP based game.\nThe game is like rust but developers will improve the game with uptades.\n\nPros;\n\n-The game has a great PvP and PvE system.\n-The game is a good survival game.\n-The game has a great and a large map with structures on it like containers.\n-The game also contains a lot of crafting.\n\nCons;\n\n-The game needs some bug fixes.\n-The game needs some optimization.\n-Some servers might lag.\n-Game needs more active developers.\n\nAnyway at all, the game is a great game. You will not have any problem and the game is also\nreally easy to understand. You will need to read the wikia of the game at some points where you will need to find some valuable stuff to make you better at the game and those things are not that hard to find too. After reading the game wikia for 10-20 minutes you will understand that it is a really easy game to play.\n\nI recommend the game to everybody and also gamers\nthat like survival based games.

I don't have friends that play this game, and people will kill you and never say a word to you, so i didn't really get to experience the true value of this game, I feel like.

Is worth every lenny penny.\n\nThe frame rate you can get in the game is great. The gunplay is great. Crafting, etc. There is so much to do and explore in this game atm... AND VEHICLES!!! I love the vehicles in this game, great for making runs to grab supplies and other things.\n------------------------------------\nMy First Time Joining A Server:\n\nI joined a server called Hurt Time, it is on the nodded server list. I am the type of person who likes starter kits. I got the starter kit and the starter kit was not OP at all. It was very balanced. (Not a Server Review...)\n\nI walked around with my pick and axe chopping and mining everything in sight. Next thing you know, *Gunshot*, I WAS SCARED ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I spent 45 minutes gathering, thinking I was about to die. I see him... He comes up to me. (PLZ DON'T Kill Me I thought in my Head)\nAll he said was: "Hii" And walked away... (Heavily Breathing) I looked at him and said hi back. This was the start of a friendship with the Tuskans, one of the  giant groups on the fairly populated server.\n------------------------------------\n\nThis Game definitely has some trolls. Nice People, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. But I already love it.\n\nI would rate this game 5 Stars\n☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆\nAnother Thing You Might want to know is that this game is VERY. I MEAN. VERY. GRINDY. My friends on the server has about 70 hours already and they say they are no where near bored, and not even 1/2 way near endgame. It just shows that this game has content.\n☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆\n\nI hope you enjoyed my review!","December 11, 2015","true","40.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Once you've reached the end-game stage, the main things to do are PvP and Raid. Raiding is extremely hard to do and requires a large amount of resources so you don't typically raid someone unless you know they're very rich or you have a personal vendetta against them. PvP is somewhat pointless as in it's rare you gain anything from it.\n\nIn order to get someones weapon (The main thing you're usually going to want when killing someone for their loot) they need to have Infamy which means they need to have killed someone recently and even then there's only a chance you get their gun as there's a chance it will drop their clothing or tools over the gun. In my opinion, raiding is not worth the resources so I stick to PvP but it is not rewarding either, unless you play Full-Loot servers. In Full-Loot servers you drop every item on your player when you die, the problem is that most of the community is too worried about losing one item, never mind their entire inventory so the Full-Loot servers are pretty much dead at all times.\n\nOne more issue is becuase of the lacking of towns and specific pvp areas,  people tend to pvp around the spawn points which puts new players at a huge disadvantage, they cannot defend themselves. A large amount of people like to build large towers and snipe out of little holes so it's hard for players to fight back and if they die, their loot drops into their base (Reassuring them they won't even lose a single item). Makes for a terrible PvP experience.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTL;DR: Raiding will typically make you use more resources then you will gain, whereas PvP will have you gain nothing unless you're lucky. Game is fun to play until you reach the End Game stage; the stage you're working towards but find out is not what you were hoping for. Just like most internet communitys this one has a very toxic one, some players do whatever they can to ensure they have the advantage; even if it means ruining pvp for everyone else.","January 5","false","499.1"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Its addictive as hell! You should play it with atleast one friend (we're currently a team of 4, tearing ♥♥♥♥ up)\n\nThe game is really nice even though its in alpha/beta. There are bugs here and there but overall its functioning and well worth buying. I see lots of potential for this game, there are so many things they can add and change.\n\nThe PvE is really fun, you need to gather resources in order to build your base. I would however hope to see more resources and building options in the future, roofs for example (using floors works fine for the most part). But as I said its in alpha/beta.\n\nThe PvP is awesome. U need to gather lots of resources before you can take on the dudes who's carrying assault rifles or shotguns, unless u'r really skilled and sneaky. The game allows for lots of strategy and you constantly learn new stuff. In order to raid other peoples bases you need explovies, which are really expensive to make. Or you camp outside their base and kill em while the door is open and hope they don't have double doors.\n\nOverall its cool, it's got basic graphics and physics but the overall feel of the game is really neat.

But It lacks content after a day you have basically nothing to do in the game as far as exploring the map, and farming resources to craft items.\n\nThis game should have been FREE TO PLAY from the release, due to lack of content and bug issues.\n\nI would rate the game as it is right now 6/10, just because there is NO FREAKING CONTENT in the game.","December 22, 2015","true","145.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Im looking forward to future updates as in its very early state right now it has a fair amount of content to be getting on with already.","December 12, 2015","true","9.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Hurtworld is very much like RUST. The graphics are relatively similiar and the game plays out similiar.\n\nHowever this game is very much better than RUST for a number of reasons.\n>The community is at this moment nowhere near as toxic. You can happily have conversations with new spawns or even people who can kill you and take all your stuff without you being able to do a thing about it.\n> I haven't played RUST in a while but the crafting system in this game comes across a lot better to me. It tells you the recipe clearly and easy to get the hang of.\n> The qwerty graphics are very nice and clean. They make the game have a unique feel depsite being a very similiar sandbox survival to RUST.\n> The game took me around 3 minutes to install with the download being next to none but the content relatively large.\n\nAs this game is in Alpha and only just released hopefully some DEV's see this and can make improvements. These below are all points for improvement, they may be percieved as negative but considering how early this game is into development It is in its current stage very good.\n>Add more content - The game itself requires a real grind but when you have M4's and a car and so many resources there isn't anything to play for. I turned to raiding even though it goes against an earlier comment, I did because I could.\n>The map itself is relatively small for a sandbox survival, as soon as you hit the desert or far reaches of the polar biome which is surprisingly small you can go no further. The map in my opinion needs to be bigger and given actual towns and more biomes at least.\n>Expanding on a previous point and perhaps my most contraversial (R.I.P English) a bigger map would provide more space for vehicles and a stronger variety. Personally I would like to see Aeroplanes. I may be alone at this point but the idea of making a base with a runway or helipad appeals to me. Also a large map, travelling to other parts of an expansive map seems incredible.\n> I would like to see more animals and more threats. Sasquatches are not much of a threat and with an M4 easy to kill. Even a Yeti provides no challenge against 2 players with a gun or even a hunting bow. Perhaps add more animals such as lions etc. A big threat yet providing reward for people who kill them. Animals on any level would be appreciated.\n> My one complaint will be deer's... They attack you proving no threat whatsoever but Deer's would never attack a human I don't understand why they are so aggressive. Stupid but valid.\n\nIn general I have spent around 25 hours on this game and have already enjoyed some great moments. I did run out of things to do but that can be expected in a game within such early stages. I am very excited to see what the DEV's do with this game and where they take it. I hope some people can agree with my aeroplanes point. Regardless lets just hope the devs stay active and add more variety to an already decent game.","December 22, 2015","true","34.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This game is a simple copy and paste of rust, but i need to say that some things in this game are made better than in rust. Firstly, this game have better community than rust, and theres no cheaters. Secondly, this game is survival, not dumb p v p in which everyone want just raid other bases and kill other players. In this game its really hard to survive, weapons are really hard to get, but they are very good, so its profitable to make them. In Hurtworld, we need also to build base fast, otherwise we will get heatstroke (if living on desert) or we will just freeze (if living in winter biome). Same thing with clothes, thanks to hats you wont get heatstroke, and thanks to jackets you wont freeze.\n\nHow do I rate the game?\n(+)\n+ Community/no cheaters\n+ Graphics other than in other games.\n+ This game has been related 2 weeks ago and it have less bugs/glitches than alot of other games that have been related long time ago.\n+ It's impossible to get bored with this game.\n+ Hardcore survival\n(-)\n- Only 4 types of ranged weapons. (Assault rifle semi, Assault rifle auto, Rifle, Shotgun)\n- Theres only few types of creatures.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOverall rating: 3,9 / 5\n\nTheres alot of things which this game needs, but lets dont forget that this game is still alpha. I highly recommend this game, for people that likes survival games.\n\n\n","December 26, 2015","true","41.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Yet, I do hope the developers do not abandon this title, because there is not enough content for the price tag.\nThe true fun of this game appears when you are wallowing around with your friends, and a gunfight sprouts from the dunes. Cars are a lot of fun, just get ready to grind for the parts...and grind for everything else.\nBase building is a lot of fun in my opinion, and the great thing, it can only be destroyed by C4 (the hardest thing in the game to get). I advise you do not trust naked men on the side of the road to go in your house. They will steal everything you have.\nYou will die in this pretty but plain world. Thankfully, you do not lose your tools you spent hours grinding for to create. You only lose the items you use to build these tools... Tread cautiously, friends.\nI will continue to play this game, and I thank my companion for buying it for me. Just remember: This is Hurtworld. Not...Softworld?

The game is very fun and I recomend it, but consider rust, if you like builder and surviving more than more of the killing side, the pvp in hurtword is very fun and easy to learn while rust is hard but fun if you learn it.","May 23","true","0.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Now a clan of 4 or 5 people can pretty much take over a server because there aren\'t enough people playing. The game has a lot of potential but in its current state, it\'s definitely not worth it.\n\nDevs don\'t update the game enough. By the time updates do come out, players have already lost the hype.\nThere is only one map so exploring gets boring quickly, and the way it\'s designed makes it incredibly easy for people to camp the noobie area. I\'ve seen way too many new players ragequit in their first day because some group living near the spawn area finds them every few minutes and kills them. I know being killed is part of any survival game, but I find the way this game has it set up just makes it so much worse for new players.\nOnce you do get off your feet, you realize there just isn\'t enough content to keep you interested. Imo the main thing that kept people playing was the community but sincemost servers are nearly empty nowadays, there\'s nothing left to work for.\n\nHonestly, the only thing that stands out about this game compared to other popular ones are the cars, but cars aren\'t worth spending nearly $30.","June 1","false","62.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I like how transparent the devs are about what they are working on and the issues they may face which allow players versed in Unity to chime in to help out. The fact it is done in Unity and is now workshop should allow more workshop items and make it fairly easy to create asstes for the game. Since the workshop update there are a handful of cool user made maps, and I am sure there is more to come. If you are worried about balance they are always working on that to make the best gameplay experience. I mostly play on a role playing server with a custom map and love it. Keep in mind that it is still early access with wipes that happen, look at it as a way to start over with new items and tools to play better than before.

Some will like that it doesn't, but I for one don't like it. There's no "risk" when you log out which really is what makes these games fun. When you die, you don't lose your tools, you just lose your resources. The only way for you to lose your tools is to be "infamous." This game is attempting to solve the KOS issue in most survival games by incorporating this infamous system. If you kill someone ( even in self defense, which is an issue) you become infamous and can then lose ALL of your gear. So, you have to think twice before you kill someone if you've spent a lot of time upgrading your tools. BUT, it still doesn't stop the person that killed you from just logging off... which is more annoying than anything since there are no sleepers.\nRegardless though, I love being able to spawn with all of my tools so you can get right back in the mix, but at the same time, the consequences for dying aren't near as dire, which can hurt the immersion.\nIt also needs some ambient sound!!!!!\n\nBut, for right now, I'm having a blast. I forgot to eat while playing this game. Looking forward to dig in more! Highly reccomended.

Unlike some other games on the market *cough* *cough* rust, the game doesn't heavily favour groups and punish solo players, its also a lot more forgiving in its survival mechanics but they can still kill you if you dont manage your warmth and food supply well enough.

Unlike some other games on the market *cough* *cough* rust, the game doesn't heavily favour groups and punish solo players, its also a lot more forgiving in its survival mechanics but they can still kill you if you dont manage your warmth and food supply well enough. I'd say its worth the $19.99 asking price as the devs seem dedicated to actually fleshing this out into a full game unlike other developers *cough* *cough* DayZ.","December 7, 2015","true","10.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The developers will not aid you if this happens and you are just S.O.L.\n\nNon official servers do have more active admins, however if you are an english speaking player in america you will only find servers (with players) that get away from the intended gameplay meaning (x200 resources, starting kits that include guns from first spawn and other mechanics that ruin survival gameplay)\n\nEnglish speaking Vanilla Non official servers do exist but they have 2 to 4 players active and are usually very high ping.\n\nIf you are Russian or Polish, there are many great vanilla non official servers with players on, might be a good purchase for you, otherwise your better off just buying a CS or another game that is what Hurtworld is becoming in the non official server side.\n\nOr play the official server and get your 16+ base stolen by a person who can glitch in and authorize themselves in your land and have aimbot on in case you try to fight back, with 0 help from admins/devs.\n\nCheck their FB page before purchasing, you will see that they have 0 contact with players. their support will never respond to you.","May 22","false","421.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

We installed 2 last night, on that specific server, they lasted 5 days.\n\nThe hackers and people who dont like players who speak english have %100 ruined this game for me and likely many, many more players.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aluv94/recommended/393420/","Aluv94","The Nomad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aluv94/","24 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nEdit: After 18 Hours of Playtime.\n\nWhat can I say about this new gem that has been brought upon us? Hurtworld is going to stay true to its name, this game will hurt you. After playing roughly 18 hours in one session I feel I am capable enough of giving a fair review after what I have experienced.\n\nPROS:\n\nThe "Progression System" feels authentic. There's no fast tracking way to reaching the maximum potential right now. Everyone is capable of obtaining the same items no matter if you're a solo player or a group player, but obviously groups are superior on this.\n\nCrafting: The crafting system is easy to learn and with the items you receive/upgrade the benefits are shown easily.\n\nVehicles: Having vehicles are a luxury and are not in any means easy to come across. The driving inputs are a little awkward and your car may get jammed randomly in objects but they are possible to unbudge and continue.\n\nCombat is fair and brutal: If someone gets the jump on you first, chances are you may go down unless your skills can suffice.\n\nTools/Essentials kept on death: This is the only Non-Hardcore part I've found about hurtworld. Tools such as Hatchets/Bows/Guns/Pickaxes etc are kept upon death as long as they're binded to your toolbar.\n\nOne last thing before we get to the Cons. SLEEPERS AREN'T IN THIS GAME! I've been stressing it since Rust about this issue. Having sleepers in a survival game kills the Solo/Duo community. People have lives, jobs, children and families, There is no way you as a Solo player are going to be able to establish yourself if there's no way of guaranting progress after you log off because some naked with a spear finds your body out in the wild. Thank you for removing this toxic mechanic.\n\nCONS:\n\nHunger meter: Food is hard to come by even while hunting it seems like you're always hungry and need a bulk of food at all times.\n\nDay/Night cycles: Day and Night together run by too fast when playing, feels like you are getting prepared to go on a journey and right when you are about to leave it's nightfall.\n\nYou will not build a base quick, It's difficult to especially as a solo player to establish yourself within your first session (2-4 hours) Luckily whatever's in your posession on logout will be retained due to having no Sleepers.\n\nPopulation Cap: Personally I believe it's still too low and should be increased to 100/200 per server, but this game's still new and chances will continue to be made.\n\nAt the end of all of this, Do I recommend this game? Personally if you're a fan of survival titles and are sick of looking for your perfect match this is the perfect survival title in my opinion. It has every gritty aspect of grinding about in hopes of surviving every day. It's easy to catch on at the start and will keep beating you into the ground every minute you're playing. Even once you are comfortable with your living, you can go outside and get speared down by several players for your loot within seconds.\n\n9.5/10","December 4, 2015","true","139.4"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Just to be clear. This is also just a very basic review, if anyone would like me to do a full detailed review, I can.

It's very stable and well optimized and has a lot of content in it already which others games are lacking, especially on their first day of release.\n\nI've been put off buying anymore EA games due to how most of them have turned out, but having already seen the positive reviews and a look at videos, I thought that surely one of these games has to be good right? I think Hurtworld may just be it.\n\nSure it needs improvements, but its Early Access and I am confident the developers will make this great. They already communicate exceptionally well for a developer and it has all the makings to be an awesome game and one of the stand-out survival games. Oh and there are no zombies in sight!\n\nIt is similar to Legacy Rust in a lot of ways, but in my opinion is better overall. It also has similarities to The Long Dark so if you are a fan of survival games, particularly the latter, then you'll enjoy Hurtworld.","December 4, 2015","true","24.6"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

Only thing is that right now everyone wanna play the game, so it takes a while before you can join a server due to server beeing full.\n\nRather then that i like the veichles, you need to have em, or atleast make multiple bases around, since you addicted to go around the world/places to find what you need to craft.\n\nOfc there is allot of KOS in this game, it's like that in mostly every survival game, i reccomend you also having some friends to play with, or find someone online in the game, I can't say this is much of a solo playing game, since you need to gather allot of stuff around in the world.\n\nOverall i am very pleased by this game, can't wait til more stuff gets put in an wich path this game is gonna go furtere in time, i am having such a great time with Hurtworld, i also do stream this game allot just trying to show off how much fun this game can be when you get a base set up and getting some of the cars.\n\nFeel free to click that like or dislike button, comment on my review if you want i like to hear others opinion about the game!

Especially for those who loved Rust legacy and the new Rust.\n-The community is friendly and helpfull which i dont see so often in other games.\n-I got straight 60 fps on the highst settings and i dont have the best PC. That makes it probably playable for everyone.\n-Surviving is hard and that makes it for me to an interesting game\n\nCON:\n\n-What makes me sad about this game are the cheaters. There are too much of them and they make it so hard for you to have fun in this game.\n-Its sometimes buggy but thats not annoying at all.\n\nDont forget it is a new game in early access and everything can be changed. And i am sure they will add a good Anti-Cheat System and try to improve the game. All in all if u are new into this game just start  with a server that hasnt so much player to learn everything about this game and there are mostly no cheaters.","December 16, 2015","true","88.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

But, it definitly needs a lot of work. There isnt a lot of replayability right now. Building a house is hard, there are hackers, there's hardly any clay so making a totem is very difficult. Starting out in this game is not easy at all.\n\nI really enjoy the building in this game and how you get a "square" if you're able to claim it. But it still needs work. There isnt much in the way of customization for building bases.\n\nMy only issue is that the guns and vehicals have way too much of a DayZ vibe. Which i'm not a fan of.\n\nPS: The environment will kill you. It's pretty hard to stay alive.","December 11, 2015","true","8.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Also early access so there are tons of wipes on the average of 3 days.\n\nIf you want to support a right idea survival game then this is a good one because this is a good game with tons of output to come, but not much too offer as of yet.

The game is AWESOME, actually is one of the best survival games i've played. Devs keep updating it. However, people always forget what is the concept of an EARLY ACCESS game. The game is changing, almost every patch. There is always something new, something removed, something fixed, new bugs, bugs fixed and of course ... THERE WILL BE WIPES. If you keep that in mind, you'll discover that Hurtworld is what every alpha game should be: updated.\n\nThe game is amazing, if you jump into it for the first time, you'll see some similarity to other survival games, and if you keep playing you will discover new things every time. The first time I entered a biome, I was like WTF dude, i'm freezing. Few minutes later I managed to build a fire and another player came with his hands up, asking if he could join me. Nice communication, without kos. Then we found an Yeti.........awesome creature. Such fur. Much horns. Damn i'm dead.\nPve is real, and it's dangerous.

If they make raiding a actul thing i could see this game lasting through that begining stages of early acess.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Room217/recommended/393420/","Room217","Obscurify","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Room217/","129 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nGreat game with extremely frequent updates + devblogs to keep you in the loop. Community is mildly friendly with the occasional d-bag here and there. Often if you claim you're friendly you're usually left alone. Infamy system could use a bit more polishing but it has a great general idea, if you kill too many people you'll have a chance of dropping the gear you worked really hard for when you die, which means banditing is discouraged. There's lots of mobs, both dangerous and harmless, like the boar and acid-spitter (too lazy to pronounce their real names). Graphics are enjoyable and the animations are hardly clunky, think of it like a mix between borderlands and Team Fortress 2.\n\nThe map, overall, is pretty large. There isn't any procedural generation or other maps, but it's hard to get bored with a map of the scale this game has. There's plenty of biomes and the transition into them is pretty unique, it isn't just empty space either, there's landmarks, like the fortress, airfield, and aircraft carrier, which you can find loot crates at. Crafting is quite simple and far from complex, which is what makes it enjoyable and easy-to-use.\n\nOverall I'd give this game an 8/10, just because, for now, it could use more polishing and meat on its bones in terms of content.","December 13, 2015","true","7.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If they make raiding a actul thing i could see this game lasting through that begining stages of early acess.

But, it definitly needs a lot of work. There isnt a lot of replayability right now. Building a house is hard, there are hackers, there's hardly any clay so making a totem is very difficult. Starting out in this game is not easy at all.\n\nI really enjoy the building in this game and how you get a "square" if you're able to claim it. But it still needs work. There isnt much in the way of customization for building bases.\n\nMy only issue is that the guns and vehicals have way too much of a DayZ vibe.

The crafting menu is so simple but elegant in the same time .\n\nSomething else that is a game changer is the fact that if you are being killed by a player you are gonna loose all your ammo and resources ( wood , stone , flint .. everything you picked up on the way ) but you are NOT gonna loose your weapons and gear ( shoes, pants , backpack .. ) that you allready crafted .\n\nIf you decide to go on a killing-spree be careful because you will get a level of " Infamy " which means that for 15 minutes if you die there is a chance of loosing your crafted weapons ( This was made to think twice before killing someone without having consequences ) .\n\nThe experience in the game is 10/10 . The game is only gonna become much better !\n\nP.S. Be careful to build your base properly in the safe zone of a TOTEM . That way you will not join the game to realise your base is gonne :)","December 16, 2015","true","74.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Well to start as I am sure all of you know, this is a survival pvp MMO, very similar to Rust. However, this game is by far one of the most addicting games of all the ones I have played. This genre is the one I play most and I have logged more hours into a small amount of time then I have in any other game. 90 hours in 2 weeks... not bad.\nPros:\n- Great PVP\n- Great community\n- Great crafting\n- Beautiful scenery\n- Make friends/enemies\n- Runs smoothly most of the time\n- Frequent patches and updates\n- Huge amount of future plans\n- For an Alpha, very polished\n- Infamy system so you dont loose everything\n- Wipe schedules so noone becomes too powerful on a server\n- Lots of official and community servers\n\nCons:\n- Rubber band lag alot\n- FR drops occasionally\n\nThis is a game that anyone who is a fan of the genre should try, I would stray away from it if this is your first survival game as it is relativley challenging especially alone. But for $24.99 t is sure worth the price and I dont think any of you will regret the purchase.\n","January 21","true","159.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

We usually catch on pretty quick having played most of the big titles. Sadly once you build a base and get all the guns/gear and car parts this game feels empty. I had a lot of fun for about a week playing because I had a server with an average of about 40 people. That number dropped to about 10 after the first week and every other server I have joined has died as well. There just isnt the content that a game like this needs to keep people active and playing.\nI also feel like the devs are focused on some pretty useless stuff right now. After one month we are finally getting our first content update. What content you ask? We are getting giant mosquitoes and hand guns... While I have no issue with adding creatures and guns I can't help but feel like there is more important content to focus on at this time.\nAgain I had a lot of fun with this game but at this time wait for the game to add stuff to do.\nPlease check this games forum to verify what I am saying as well. A ton of threads currently are titled somewhere along the lines of Hurtworld is dead?!?!","January 7","false","219.9"," 38 of 76 people (50%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","50","38","76","5","0"

We usually catch on pretty quick having played most of the big titles. Sadly once you build a base and get all the guns/gear and car parts this game feels empty. I had a lot of fun for about a week playing because I had a server with an average of about 40 people. That number dropped to about 10 after the first week and every other server I have joined has died as well. There just isnt the content that a game like this needs to keep people active and playing.\nI also feel like the devs are focused on some pretty useless stuff right now. After one month we are finally getting our first content update. What content you ask? We are getting giant mosquitoes and hand guns... While I have no issue with adding creatures and guns I can't help but feel like there is more important content to focus on at this time.\nAgain I had a lot of fun with this game but at this time wait for the game to add stuff to do.\nPlease check this games forum to verify what I am saying as well. A ton of threads currently are titled somewhere along the lines of Hurtworld is dead?!?!","January 7","false","219.9"," 38 of 76 people (50%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","50","38","76","5","0"

At first I wasn't a fan, but I've found that the community servers generally have nicer players who are more willing to help. That being said, a couple of my friends and I host our own private server, and it is a whole lot of fun. For new people, definitely look for emptier servers.

Can\'t even last a few hours in a server without being attacked by a group of hackers that clip into your structures and completely ruin the game. Everything else is fine I guess, but this single thing makes the game horrible! It doesn\'t matter how strategically you build or how carefully you choose your hideout. If hackers find you, they will attack you. And if you win, they will get revenge by casually walking into your home, taking ownership of it, and pretty much destroying the game.","May 31","false","93.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Next time I do someone slap some sense into me.\n\nSo Day 1 I was invited to play with a popular streamer on twitch, we had both just got the game and had no clue what we were doing. After running about not being able to find each other for like an hour and dying to starvation over and over, we called it quits and had a fun time in 7 Days to Die.\n\nBut I was not willing to give up so I joined an official NA West Infinite server and started collecting resources - trying to build up and learn the game, I saw various semi naked people running around doing the same, they left me alone so I didnt bother them - after all we were all just learning the game.\n\nI built my shack, got a few oranges planted and watched general chat while I was out collecting. I could tell from chat that this game was already like rust of the past - people abusing and killing each other but I thought lets see how far into the game I can progress - the answer came quickly in the form of a shotgun.\n\nI was just laying my 1st foundation after a few hours had to watch a Youtube video to figure out you have to use a tool to do this and cant just add to your shack. I opened my door to be greeted by one [fap] member (yes he was really in a guild\clan called fap), who shotgun-ed me in the face, ran over me and stole all my stuff then proceded to kill my spawn point. He then camped me and killed me about 8 more times just to make sure I got the message then quickly wrote in chat - he attacked me?? I never knew before opening a door to my own shack was considered hostile. Why did noone tell me.\n\nNow the game might be good - I liked what little I played, but as with these type of games unless you play on a private server you will never get anywhere! See Rust\Ark and the many more that came inbetween. And for this reason not only would I not recommend it but if I could refund this months Humble Bundle monthly I would as this game will live an die by its online community and its not for me.\n\nGood Luck if you buy this on getting anywhere before you get fapped to death.","June 5","false","4.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","1"

The ability to build a base and acquire the necessary tools to do so is relatively easy.  There are some issues I have with the game though.  I prefer unmodded servers because you can get a better feel for the game.  However, you may not make it very far before someone kills and takes all your hard work away from you.  I do realize that this a game that is more PVP than anything, but I would suggest you play on a PVE modded server first before traversing to a server that is mainly PVP or the official servers.\n\nAs updates go, the wipes are few and far between which is good and bad at the same time.  Few updates means servers are rarely down, but it can cause a lot of excess clutter on some servers which can cause game issues such as lockups.  The mechanics of the game are pretty straight forward, collect, build, collect some more, build, etc.\n\nThe best part of this type of game is the ability to have vehicles.  Most servers only allow one vehicle per player which means you will have to choose between a car with 3-4 seats or a fourwheeler.  The only problem with the vehicles (at least on normal, unmodded servers is the lack of parts.  Most of the time players will receive bullets or paint when a vehicle is broken down or in loot crates.  It takes HOURs to find parts and cars only spawn about every 3 hours.\n\nIn closing, I would definitely buy this game now and play the heck out of it!

This game is well balanced and the community is excellent.\n\nIf your playing alone it could be difficult. You will get killed for your resources if you are an easy target, I played with a friend so I am having a excellent time. Most people seem to leave two guys alone. I've had several occasions where we traded resources to resolve our differences. Most people don't want to risk losing everything. If you play smart, you'll enjoy it.\n\nGood\n===========\n+Excellent combat, it is actually more fun to shoot a bow then it looks! Melee combat isn't perfect but its the best I've seen in this type of game.\n+Lots of official servers with good latency\n+Gathering resources and picking up loot is quick and painless. No mind-numbing loading bars and inventory boxes. Just grab stuff, Smash rocks and stumps with 5 hits for bulk amounts of resources.\n+Easy to pickup and play. You will have little to no difficulty getting the hang of things. You learn fast out of necessity.\n\nBad\n===========\n-The world feels a little empty at times, I would love to see more creatures and interesting landmarks.\n-Occasional ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ kills you and grabs your stuff.

At the rate this game is going it will probably be one of my favorites. The main reason this game sticks out to me from dayz or rust is that it actually works. The servers and nearly every single part of the game seems to be working as intended which is amazing compared to other similar games. As of this post the game is a little over a year in development and is 2 days after being put up for early access on steam, and I'm already having an amazing amount of fun with all of the already fleshed out features. I can only imagine what's in store for this game if the devs don't abandon it like most early access games. Play it and refund it if you don't enjoy, because if you have half a brain you will see how the devs know what they're doing so the game is balanced so the most amount of people that can have fun will. I only don't suggest this game if to people who can't handle being killed or don't have thick skin. Other han a few bugs (which is expected from a game in early alpha) and the laughably bad voice acting, I highly suggest you play this game. The price to fun ratio is off the charts unless you're a whiny ♥♥♥♥♥ or obsess over graphics.

Wonderful team of developers and it's a lot of fun. The main thing that I hate about this game is the infamy system. It makes no sense.. It literally doesn't work. For example, I killed 2 outlaws with a shotgun, they dropped their pants and shoes. Didn't drop a gun. I had a tiny bit of infamy, they instantly respawn on their stake (you respawn with the ammo in your gun for some reason) then they killed me and I dropped my gun. PVP doesn't work in this game.\n\nDon't be that guy that says something like "omg there are full loot servers which you can play on if you dont like pvp then go there!!!". First of all, It is so hard actually finding a decent full loot server with low ping. They have no admins and it lags way too much since there are buildings literally everywhere. That is if you are lucky enough to find a server with actual players.\n\nThe moment that this is fixed is the moment that I fully reccomend this game.\n\nIF YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE INFAMY SYSTEM IS: It is basically a thing to seperate the outlaws from the regular players. When you die, you don't drop basic tools, guns or clothes. However, if you kill a player then you will gain infamy. You then have a bigger chance to drop said items.\n\nThey could easily change this, make it so that you drop guns and not other things upon death.","January 19","false","163.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

When you're forced to consider a "can't beat 'em - join 'em" solution... it's time for you to go.  I remember buying one of those hint books for a game once, and how it completely ruined my enjoyment of an otherwise good game, so question what pleasure remains here for the hackers?  What is it about fair play that frightens them so much?\n\nThe Good:\nStable early access, graphics, a simplicity shouding addictive play, and enjoyable open-world construction.\n\nThe Bad:\nHacks that let you see people through mountians, hacks that let you find hidden homes, hacks that let you run faster, hacks that let you jump farther.\n\nBottomline:\nIf the developers ever figure out how to block the cheaters... I'd be back.\n\n\n\n\n","May 15","false","107.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"
