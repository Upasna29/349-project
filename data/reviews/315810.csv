It should be noted that I'm fairly new to VN games in general, having only played six or seven personally. That being said, compared to those, this blows them out of the water.\n\nFirst off, the story is not only moving and impactful, but long. You don't actuall come across the intro until about 30~ minutes in. That's just a estimate, but it honestly felt the opening came in where other VN closing credits would start rolling.\n\nSecondly, the entire VN is voice acted. Voice acted tremendously well, for that matter. Even the main protagonist has not only a voice, but a face as well.\n\nNot only that, but the art in this game is amazing. At first I thought I was delusional, but every character's eyes and mouths move.

Simple details like having the characters blink add a nice touch to an already high quality work. This is by far my favorite visual novel currently (this review was created March 22, 2015) on Steam. The $20 price tag is quite steep, so I would wait for it to go on sale (mine was 50% off). If you're looking for a serious visual novel to start reading, I recommend this.\n\nNotes:\n- Length ~15 hours (assuming you listen to the voice acting)\n- There IS voice acting\n- There are NO choices/routes in eden* (Kinetic Novel)\n- There is VERY LITTLE TO NO fan service\n- This is the regular version of eden. The eden Plus+Mosaic version (not available on Steam) includes added blood to certain scenes and less censoring for certain scenes. It also includes an extra eroge side story that is not part of the main story. In my opinion I would have liked the added blood, but an eroge side story sounds incredibly out of place for this VN.\n- I consider this a serious/emotional visual novel, unlike a VN such as Sakura Spirit. It tries to BE something and succeeds instead of appealing to absurd fan service.\n- Originally released September 18, 2009","March 22, 2015","true","15.1"," 192 of 197 people (97%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","97","192","197","11","1"

What would change for you, how would your priorities shift? Assuming you'd find an opportunity to escape, would you choose a future of perpetual narrow walls and cramped spaces over a short time of ultimate freedom followed by certain doom?\n\nFor the people living in the world of eden*, these questions are no longer abstract.\n\nMangaGamer delivers the English release of this 2009 title by minori to Steam. eden* is a kinetic novel (a story without choices or gameplay) about the last few people on a dying planet. Its most unique selling point compared to similar titles is its visual presentation: Instead of the waist-up character sprites positioned in front of static backgrounds that we are used to from most modern visual novels, it relies almost entirely on scene-by-scene custom images, each one carefully designed to take character positions and camera perspectives into account. This gives the experience a very cinematic feel, quite literally reminiscent of movies, compared to other titles of its kind. Most scenes also features blinking eyes and lip syncing with the Japanese voices, which makes it impressively lively.\n\nNeedless to say, the asset quality is excellent throughout, starting with the backgrounds ranging from the painterly to the borderline naturalistic. The same attention to detail extends to the characters who, despite the multitude of poses and perspectives, always appear consistent, unique, and alive. From what I can tell as someone who does not speak Japanese, the voices really fit well, and coupled with the competent sound design and the soundtrack by Tenmon (if you happen to enjoy Makoto Shinkai's movies: yes, that Tenmon), which expands a small number of recurring motifs into a gripping soundscape, this is an aural experience that you are unlikely to forget.\n\nThe story revolves around Warrant officer Ryou Haruna and his assignment to guard a remote research facility during the planet's final moments. A peculiar (but largely unspecified) astronomical phenomenon is going to wipe out all life on Earth, and humanity is putting the finishing touches on a centennial plan to migrate into space and search for a new home. One component of this plan are the felixes, genetically engineered superhumans whose intellect propels scientific progress far beyond its normal pace. However, there are dissenting voices claiming that humanity should face its ultimate fate head-on instead of trying to escape, so military protection is granted to essential actors within the plan – in particular to Sion, the supreme felix, mastermind behind the giant starships and humanity's savior.\n\nThe central themes of eden* include destiny and free will as well as the morality of living one's life for someone else. Ryou, as the self-described "military's attack dog," and Sion, as the people's only hope to keep on living, are both so devoted to their duties that they have fallen out of touch with their own humanity. Circumstances force them to confront their deeply buried sense of self and be thrust before the most pivotal decision of their lives: to keep on living in the narrow golden cages of their own design, or to choose the ultimate act of defiance and experience the freedom and joy that they had always denied themselves, living life to the fullest until the curtain falls.\n\nThe writing tends to focus on character interaction and personal growth over story complexity – eden* is all about the human condition, not about hard sci-fi. In fact, even the scientific details of the end of the world are almost completely glossed over. If you are looking for an apocalyptic sci-fi story with cool technology, this isn't it. Rather, the focus on the characters is so strong that it could be described as downright melodramatic in parts, insofar as that can be a good thing. It features countless goosebumps-inducing, memorable, quotable moments that easily smooth over the fact that some of the tension maybe could have been resolved in easier ways, or that there's a certain degree of plot convenience constructing the situations that are most interesting for the characters. It all ends up feeling very complete and satisfying.\n\nAll in all, I can recommend eden* without much in the way of caveats. If you dislike visual novels or anime-style art, odds are you have not read this far down. If you like visual novels but you're not sure if this one is worth your time, my answer is that it is. I also recommend avoiding playtime estimates. Reading speed varies from person to person anyway, but the later parts of this story work best if you can empathize with the sense of impending dread that the characters are feeling. For them, any day, any moment, could be the last one. It'll be more fun for you if you can get lost in that feeling as well, instead of calculating how many hours you might have left. Even if you have little to no experience with visual novels, this one is probably a better one to get started than most titles currently on Steam. With the above-mentioned reservations in mind, eden* easily gets a positive recommendation from me.","June 13, 2015","true","9.3"," 81 of 86 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","81","86","3","3"

Around the time that I got involved with adult responsibilities a couple year back, I involuntarily stopped sparing time for the genre. Thanks to a friend's insistent screenshot sharing of many beautiful VNs, I noticed that I've been missing pretty artwork and superficial stories in a very girly manner. I gave up and decided to give the genre a go after a long time. My first pick though, being anything but superficial, left me thoughtful and shaken.\n\neden* is a tale of compassion, free will and tomorrow. It is the tale of a world coming to its end. It all started with the appearance of an ominous red star on the sky. After through research, scientists agreed that it is the first warning sign of the end. It took a hundred years for mankind to prepare themselves for a major immigration project to evacuate the planet and search for its destiny elsewhere. During these final moments of the worn planet earth, there are yet things to wonder and chains to break. Between a stoic soldier, a secluded genius, a kind maid, a broken warrior, a regretful commander and a loud journalist; eden* is the tale of breaking chains.\n\nThe game is designed to be a kinetic novel - which means a visual novel without any choice options. You only keep reading and watching the story as it unfolds. In this manner, it cannot wholly be defined as a game. The quality of CGs and the labor put into artwork are far beyond your casual visual novel though. Characters present a full selection of animations, including moving eyes and lip synch with Japanese voice acting. Voice acting is also beyond the par, as if taken out of an A+ anime series. Translation from Japanese to English is great - which is a rare case in any media - and manages to deepen the mood furthermore. The game is quite long so to say; if you'll be waiting for voice acting you can expect an average game time of 13-15 hours.\n\nI'd love to share some character details, but any relevant information about identities or backgrounds would be downright spoilers. Have you ever watched Clannad? With After Story part of course. If your answer is no, it is a huge recommendation. If yes, you already know what kind of soul wrecking experience that you are getting yourself into. You'll remember Sion and Ryou's story for a long while.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","September 5, 2015","true","15.3"," 61 of 67 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","61","67","0","3"

Wondering why this settlement would need so much protection, he soon discovers that it is the home and workplace of a girl named Sion, who is hard at work developing ways for the people around the world to leave Earth before an unknown calamity.\n\nRight off the bat, I’ll have to praise the game for its incredible pacing, writing and voice acting. Not once did I ever feel bored while reading through eden*. Each scene only lasts a few short minutes so you’re never forced to go through a large chunk of it at a time, but at the same time the writing is so good that you’re always wondering what happens next.\n\nThe kinetic style of eden* doesn’t hamper the story it tells. It perfectly complements the story by providing you with great illustrations and emotional music that really makes you feel every scene. The world is well-built, the graphics are beautiful, the characters are engaging and the voice acting is top-notch.\n\nIt’s very difficult to review a kinetic visual novel without spoiling anything important. I will tell you, however, that I was hooked basically from the very first scene, and more than a few tears will be shed by the end.\n\nI highly recommend this game for fans of great stories. I also recommend you to not look at how much the game takes to complete to really feel that every day could be your last.\n\nWhat I played: The full story arc in under 8 hours (I'm a fast reader).\nLike: Basically everything.\nDislike: Basically nothing.\nRating: 5 teardrops out of 5","November 24, 2015","true","7.9"," 40 of 41 people (98%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","98","40","41","4","2"

Lots of scientists starting to predict the end of the Earth, but at this point, 100 years before its predicted end, humankind started to feel another big threat - the Earth is dying: terrorist attacks and wars are ravaging badly that it decreased the human population rapidly. After some time passes, a United World Government was formed to prevent any further human destruction. When all the fighting stopped, the remaining humans came up with a plan to escape the Earth. At the same time, people were working on the “Felix Plan”: a plan to create a new technology to bring the remaining humans to a new planet. The story of Eden* begins 99 years later, when the Earth is on the brink of destruction.\n\nMost of the stories were told via flashback and when you start the game for the first time, you could actually tell the ending since this is a kinetic VN. The flashback serves as to what is going on prior to the ending of the game and mostly consist of your SoL of Ryō & Sion.\n\nThe CG and BGM in this game was well done despite its age. The CG has that cold but warm hue to it that kinda adds melancholic feeling to the atmosphere, fitting the setting of what is going on around. I just wished that they did it on a higher resolution as most of the background CG is very calming, lushful and beautiful. The BGM is very well done, with based Tenmon also composing the BGM really gives that special feeling to it that somehow very calming yet at times is paced properly to what is going on around it.\n\nI played the game for the first time on late 2010 and I fell in love with it. It is short & touching yet even though the opening of the game kinda spoiled you the inevitable ending, you still want to stick with it and enjoy the whole story and then cries on in the end :")\n\nI recommend this VN if you enjoy planetarian and narcissu, it is on the same group cluster of short-but-packed feeling to it. This Steam version of eden* is the All-Age version, you can download the MOSAIC patch from your favorite site and inject it here or get it off MangaGamer store. Also the seiyuu of Haruna Ryō is Toru from Hitsugi no Chaika so if you're kinda ♥♥♥♥♥♥ of at the ending of Chaika, go buy this, it'll help you get moar Tooooooru satisfication :^)","January 31, 2015","true","20.1"," 47 of 60 people (78%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","78","47","60","8","0"

This game just did it.\n\neden is a kinetic visual novel with almost no required input whatsoever from the players, as the game naturally flows by itself. No branching story, no multiple endings etc. Be it so, it is brilliant on its own. The characters, the story, the soundtrack, all fit together.\n\nMany people say the artwork or graphic is stunning. It is true. There's a real art involved in this game. While it's just a mere 2D pictures, the backgrounds of each frames are nicely put together and designed, smooth flows between the transitions. The characters arts are what you can expect from Japanese games, pretty. Moreover, there's a nice design like characters eyes' blink and their expression changes, lips move in sync accordingly when the mood changes/talks. Simple touch, but meaningful - it makes everything as a whole more lively. Although yes, I do have one complaint, that is - the eyes of those chars are a bit too big overall, makes it a bit weird.\n\nDon't forget the important part for Visual Novel - it's the voice acting. While bunch of VNs abandon the voice acting because of many reasons, eden doesn't neglect it. The voice acting here is simply too good and unquestionably high production value. The actors really really pushed themselves to the limit, the emotions they bring through sheer voice acting alone is too incredible whether they portray happiness or sadness, they do it correctly. Can't deny this one is probably the strongest element this game has. That said, I'd recommend you let the game plays for you, so you get the fullest experience from hearing the voice acting. Voice acting is done in Japanese while the subtitle is in English. As someone who watches a lot of anime, I really appreciate it.\n\nThen there's a mixing element of VN, story. The story starts out slowly and seemingly simple - our protagonist Ryou is assigned to protect military base and the female protagonist Sion. But as the game progresses things getting more intense - until the first act in Military Base ends -, and the last half of the game where Ryou and Sion away, it starts slowing down again. You'll mostly see development of Ryou and Sion's relationship, how two humans with very different background fall for each others. Sad moment, happy moment, funny moment, sad again rinse and repeat. Roller coaster storyline, but by no means bad. In fact, it's very well written when combined with the game arts and voice acting. Can't say much without spoiling, and it's not funny to spoil people's experience on VN game, isn't it? Do note, again, this is a Kinetic VN. There's only one ending as an end result of one linear story and despite you know the ending is coming as you imagine and you don't want it to come, you can't stop playing.\n\n(....even I shed a tear or two watching the ending...)\n\nNow there's a con. The game's performance is a bit bad. It does not support controller natively, and this is an annoyance for people who love to lay down comfortably on the bed while reading the texts. There's also a major problem with Steam Overlay (the Developer admitted it already, and can't fix it with their current resources) so people might have problem taking a screenshot or two. I also had a problem launching the game, not until I complained endlessly and had the Developer fixed it with beta branch which I'm currently using.\n\nI also have to mention that the OSTs are not included in this Steam, be it within the game files so you can listen to them using Winamp for example, or being sold as DLCs. Too bad, would love to grab 'em - the soundtracks are really good. Here's one full song for opening movie from Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL2ZTgbgQdg\n\neden is about ten hours long if you keep playing like my pace - letting the game does everything by itself.\n\nVN is a genre that's not too popular on Steam, but overall, eden is a worthy game for any VN fans.\n\n9/10","August 7, 2015","true","60.2"," 30 of 33 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","30","33","2","1"

Visual Novel are about storytelling (or they should be) so most of the time you just advance the test.\nThis particular Visual Novel is a Kinetic Novel meaning you literally can't do anything during the gameplay. It's like an animated picture book with (japanese) voice acting and background music.\n\nAmong Visual Novels this is one of the best I've ever read so if you feel you might be intrested in a good, heartwarming and bittersweetstory then you have my recommendation. This is one of the finest examples of what Visual Novels can be at their best.\n\n\nFor those who already fans of the Visual Novel genre:\n\nThis is not a nukige. If you just wanna buy it because "lol it has a lol" then shame on you!\nIt's a feel-heavy storytelling piece which really deserves it's price. If you will buy just one VN in your entire life then put this game on the candidate list ASAP.\nAs to which version to buy. I have the PLUS+ MOSAIC from the Mangagamer site and after reading trough the game I cannot in good conscience go to the adult content.  Belive me you wouldn't miss anything with the Steam version.\n\nIt's important to note that adult content was in fact not censored away from this version but THIS is the original version of the game. The PLUS+ MOSAIC were originally a DLC and it can't be patched into the Steam version but again this game is more than perfectly fine without it.

Eden* is one of the best stories I've ever experienced in any medium. It is an absolute masterpiece, and that's not hyperbole. If you're looking for a brilliantly-crafted story that has tragedy, intelligent characters, meaningful dialogs, romance done right, and bittersweetness all around, look no further. It also has one of the most interesting fictional characters I've seen (Sion), and her interactions with the main protagonist (Ryou) are fascinating.\n\nOne more thing to note. Much like the movie "Full Metal Jacket", Eden* is split into two distinct halves, and in my opinion, the second half is where the VN actually starts. The first half is moderately interesting, but fairly dry, and for me mostly exists as necessary backstory and character introduction. The second half is where Sion really shines and the VN properly begins.\n\nThat being said, $20 is a steal for a story you'll never forget.","February 17","true","17.1"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","18","19","2","1"

If you are Haruna Ryou, you take this opportunity so that you can live the last happy life on this dying planet.\n\nNOTE: This is a slow paced visual novel. There are only a few jokes here and there to lighten the mood sometimes. Otherwise, this VN can take 10+ hours to read, so if you don't have the patience and you just want to finish a story quickly, this VN probably isn't for you.\n\nWhat type of VN is this?This is a kinetic VN, meaning that you read it as if it were a story book. There are no choices to make so just sit back and enjoy the story (and keep tapping the space bar to move to the next line of text if you don't have Auto forward turned on).\n\nStory:To put it short: The world is coming to an end. People are preparing to evacuate from Earth. Creatures know as Felixes have helped humanity with the evacuation, including one particular Felix, Sion.\nWarrant Officer Ryou is a deadly soldier who struggles to find the reason why he wants to fight and what his goals in life are. He is assigned with a comrade named Lavie by his lieutenant to protect Sion.\n\nThe story is told in flashbacks. The story begins with the present, with Ryou and Sion living together. Afterwards, we go back in time and see how things came to be.\n\nVisuals:There is a reason why Minori's name is on this VN. The scenes are very well done. They are simply, yet beautiful. Character designs are nice. While the building interiors may look generic, there is usually that light streak that helps add some "life" to the scenes. Characters will also blink (it's not much, but its at least better than looking at a still , unmoving picture).\n\nSound:Maybe I love the Opening them for eden too much. The soundtrack consists of soft piano music in the background that helps accompany certain scenes. When dramatic scenes start to roll in, you will feel it.\nThe voice acting for this VN is superb. None of the dialogue feels rushed and it feels as if the characters are having a real conversation as they usually would. When things get serious, you will definitely hear it coming.\n\n\nShould you buy it?Like I said before, it's best to enjoy eden if you have the patience for this story. This story can be considered a love story".\n\n- Psychii","September 18, 2015","true","20.6"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","15","17","0","0"

I still cannot really tell if the music is incredible sad or unbelievable beautiful. But it comforts the story and the dialogue so well that it's always on point.\nEven if you take out the music itself I could listen to Eden's* tunes everyday without playing the game just because it's so amazing, heart touching and it feels like opening up a gate into your very own imagination.\n\nEven though I finished the story it feels like it never ended. I have played the second half of this game in one go because there was no way for me to stop in the middle of this beautiful story but afterwards I was kinda sad.\nSad that I've read it in one go. Sad that it actually ended. But on the other hand this is a story so perfect that even if the story is over, even if the world would end, it still continues.\nAnd still I have the feeling that I want to experience this even further, even after the game has ended.\n\nThis story would not change if you read it a second time, but it wouldnt lose its power either. It is rare for me, that a story brings me down to tears, but that term would be way to less to describe the state this game left me in. I have never cried over a story for more than 3 hours STRAIGHT. Just because it was so beautiful and heart breaking in the same time. And I do know for myself that I will play this game over and over again, countless times and the fact that I cry would not change. I think it would be a shame not to cry at this brilliant story. It deserves to shed some tears.\n\nIf you have the time, the patience/concentration and the interest to experience a story beyond any expectations please give Eden* a chance.\nI do wanna point out in the end that all the small details that may be just everyday things become a part of the big beautiful scenery, so it is worth to give everything a second look and thought.\n\nWith this I feel like I should come to an end even if I still got countless words that I want to say about this story, but after all, this story speaks louder than any voice/text or review could.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read my opinion about Eden* !\nAnd for everyone out there, if you look for a story so perfect end emotional that it will for sure stay in your mind over a very long time get Eden* and have yourself that incredible experience.\n\nSpecial THANKS to my good friend Dawn who recommended and bought me this.!","March 21","true","20.8"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","1"

It's about 8 hours oif quality entertainment with characters I came to care about, and that actually brought me to some tears of happiness and sadness.\n\nIt's hard to discuss this without giving plot away, The characters are all well fleshed out, though in a couple of instances, I wish they had been more so, such as Major Inaba and Ryou's sister. Those are minor gripes though.\n\nSo why are you still here reading this rambling review? Go play the game!\n\n\n\n\nGo! :)","April 4, 2015","true","7.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","6","6","2","0"

But-\n\nTo be honest, I don't think I could do it proper justice. While it's short, eden* instills you with a few feelings so strongly that by the end all you want to do is go back over it all. To relive that experience. This is definitely something I'll re-read in a couple of months time, just to go through those emotions again.\n\nDefinitely suggest this to anyone who enjoys reading. No big plot twists, the reveals are easy enough to guess in advance and there are a few tropes that are followed. Despite that, it tells an engaging and relatively unique love story that I'm glad I took the time to read. You will, too.\n\nI promise.","June 21, 2015","true","6.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/315810/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Eden is a visual novel set in the near future with Earth on the brink of destruction. We see the story through the eyes of an elite soldier called Ryou Haruna who is a personal guard to Sion, the Earth's lead scientist. We are just a passive observer and have no control over anything except when to start the next line of dialogue. There are no decisions to be made or any dialogue choices here. It does make your character more interesting and it makes for some pretty tense situations in where you hope he does the “right” thing. But that also means you will be doing nothing but right clicking from start to finish which can be a turn off considering it is a lengthy game that took me about 12 hours to complete.\n\nOptions menu doesn't have much to it but a very neat feature is that you can turn off individual characters voice actors if you don't like there acting. Can't speak of the quality of acting as it is all in Japanese with subtitles being in English. Starting off you are in a field with Sion and it's all calm and happy. After a short while you are teleported back to the events that got you there which was kind of daunting and that intro served no purpose other then taking the impact out of scenes, as you already know both Sion and Ryou will be fine. Anyways, after the intro you will be on your way to a secluded island masion which is housing the renowned genius Sion who is working on her lasts steps to get mankind off of the dying planet.\n\nEven though the world is about to end and Sion is nearly done with her work there are infiltrators that want to kill her. The game does not handle intrigue and mystery well. For example someone says “She is a...” and the game fades to white and teleports you to another point in the future leaving you clueless as to where you are or what you are doing now. If you don't want us to know about it yet just don't bring it up. Another scene has you killing an infiltrator but you never see it happen, instead you are teleported a bit forward in time after the murder happens, leaving you wondering “Wait. He is dead now? Well, okay then.”  It does this every time something mildly interesting happens which makes the game an utter chore to play until you escape the island.\n\nCharacters don't help at all either. Most are very unlikable which would be perfectly fine if they didn't try to play them off as good guys later on. Especially your character. He is supposed to be some elite solider that doesn't question orders but comes off as an extremely paranoid antisocial psychopath. That would make sense though the game never builds him up as a character or shows what he has been through to make him so psychopathic. Seeing his transformation from a sad kid to a hardened soldier would have been a much more interesting tale than anything on offer here. It is an interesting setting, humanity went bunkers after the red star in the sky was confirmed to destroy Earth and started a World War. Afterwards they focused on escaping the dying planet but some people refused to leave and started a guerrilla style war against the government.\n\nBut no, there we are stuck in a mansion with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ protagonist and nothing much of interest going on. It really picks  after you escape the mansion though. As to be expected from this game it doesn't tell or show about your journey or how you avoided the military after escaping, you just teleport to a safe house. In that environment is where the game really shines. Sion being sick to the point of dying any moment really tugs on the heart strings. She is a super genius but she has been so sheltered that she does not know how to do the most basic of things like cooking or brushing her hair. You take on a father like role until things get romantic which is uncomfortable considering she has the body of a child. That is very late into the game though, do not be expecting a romance game, it is more of about taking care of a dying “child”.\n\nLate in the game they also introduce the only other decent character besides Sion. It is entertaining watching our psychopath Ryou bully her, though Ryou will never become a likable character. Eden does a far better job mixing day to day comedy and sadness in events leading into the end of the world than trying to tell an actual narrative. There is nearly no “fan service” except for one scene showing a girl in a bikini which was a nice change a pace from most Visual Novels.  Our character does like to stare at breasts though and probably spends more time looking there than at their faces. You can also buy a different version over at MangaGamer.com that features H scenes if you are interested but the story is perfectly fine without it.\n\nOne thing that really helps set the mood is the amazing soundtrack featured in this game. All the songs are top notch and really amplify the powerful moments. Artstyle is great though the environments are nothing special. This is a strange title. It does nothing right story-wise other than get you to care about Sion. If it didn't reveal right off the bat that you will escape safely there might have been some tense or interesting moments in the mansion which is a shame as the intro served absolutely no purpose. Eden did something right though since even if we all know how it will end you can't help but see it through to the end. It's not awful but it is a very slow burner and has neither the characters, the overall objective or the story to hold your interest until you reach the good parts. Something like finding out secrets about the facility, having the infiltrators be an actual threat or having meaningless dialogue options would have done wonders to alleviate the boredom. When all is said and done the last few hours are pretty memorable and emotional which does save the game in my opinion. Recommended to Visual Novel fans with a lot of patience.","July 4, 2015","true","14.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

It has an amazing story and is very immersive. I have about 5-6 hours of play time in, so far it seems much lengthier than most visual novels. I honestly forget that I am playing a visual novel and feel like I am watching an anime when I am playing this game. As with most visual novels there is 0 interaction with the game or gameplay, the entire game is like a movie/one long cutscene. This may come as a surprise if you are new to this genre.

Both are short kinetic novels, both deal with heavy topics like death.  But I think Eden* handles its topics a lot more interestingly than Narcissu.\n\nA lot like Narcissu, death is a looming inevitability on the minds of the main characters.  For Narcissu, the constant talk of death and hopelessness turns the story into a drawn-out slog with an inevitable conclusion.  The characters don't really grow or noticably change over the course of the story.  Eden* handles the same concepts in a way that is a lot easier to swallow.  It isn't a spoiler to say that the main heroine dies in this story.  But how it handles that character death makes all the difference.  Eden* uses every chance it gets to develop its main hero and heroine into interesting characters with detailed motivations.  Where Narcissu was primarily about picking a better place to die than a hospital, Eden*s characters  use their struggles with their own mortality (either due to physical illness or the approaching end of the world) to learn to live life to its fullest with what time they have left.\n\nComing back and reading Narcissu again recently after having not read it for several years left me feeling depressed and almost...empty.  It was a soul-sucking experience.  But Eden*, despite being at times equally dark, sometimes even moreso because the characters were so much more three-dimensional, left me feeling uplifted and more positive about life.  I felt like it had really successfully communicated to me how important living my limited days on this earth to their fullest is.  So I think that's really a victory for this game's storytelling.\n\nNow that that's out of the way, pros and cons.\n+Great art.  This is subjective, of course, but if you don't mind the Key/Visual Arts-style GIANT ANIMU EYES, the spritework is great.  The occasional sweeping vista of fields or mountain lakes look great too.\n+Great writing.  I only recall seeing a few minor typos, and it all read very smoothly over the 7 hour experience.\n+/-  Music and general sound design was competent, but I don't recall anything hugely impressive.\n- This isn't really surprising to anyone that has played a visual novel before, but there are no resolution settings.  You have windowed and fullscreen.  I just played in windowed.\n\nVerdict: if you're looking for a book-like experience and don't mind moe-style eyes, pick this game up.  It's a beautiful story and you'll love all the characters by the end.","April 13, 2015","true","7.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It's good, but not great. A decent premise and some characters who don't stick completely to type make it better than most visual novels, but too many cliches drag it down and the ending feels like a cheat.\nThe world's about to end, and there's nothing anyone can do about it. After decades of civil war the last of the human race has come together to realise a desperate plan. A genetically engineered young scientist, smartest of her kind, has come up with a design for a fleet of spaceships to ferry the survivors off-planet to start over somewhere else. And a weary, battle-hardened soldier takes an unusual posting to the secluded military base where the genius is holed up.\n\neden* is a little more mature than your average visual novel, then: sure, it's merely an elaborate excuse for two wounded birds to fall for each other, and the daft character designs make that clear (the tiny, waifish heroine with her huge, vulnerable eyes!) but it's refreshingly low-key in many respects. No aliens, no elaborate pseudo-science, no brazen monologuing, just a clock slowly winding down.\n\nIt's a book you click through - totally linear, no branches - and the plot struggles to find its feet a bit. The localisation is occasionally dire, with some truly awful, dreary prose early on. The few action scenes are borderline incompetent, and the attempts at comedy aren't much better (because maid uniforms and sexual harrassment in the military are hilarious, am I right?).\n\nBut slowly, surely, it gets better. You realise characters have depth, and nuance, and they aren't just sticking rigidly to stereotypes. Potentially cliched plot beats just get tossed aside with a surprisingly level-headed "Nah, I'm not going to stress about that any more". And it stays relatively quiet, and subtle - a couple of gorgeous repeating musical themes help with this immeasurably. It's melodramatic still, but it's good, solid melodrama.\n\nIt's a shame, then, that the ending feels like a cheat. What happens to the two leads, all alone on a dying planet, is interesting but it's pretty obvious what soap opera plot device we're following and the way the game resolves it is frustratingly problematic and depressingly predictable. It doesn't totally kill the emotion the rest of the game built up, but it's far sillier, far more obviously manipulative.\n\nI doubt many people who aren't hardcore visual novel fans already would think eden* is worth the asking price; I can think of any number of books you could buy instead. A few pretty pictures and some decent voice acting don't make up for that.

I'll just give a quick review based on my first time\n\nStory: The story builds around bittersweet theme. It has some heartwarming friendship and romance, with an unavoidable doom that waits in the end of the story. While the story lacks world building and near-end events (which bugs me a little), that doesn't really change how good the story actually is.\n\nCharacter: one of the thing that surprises me is that the character and their development is pretty good. even the supportive character has their own interesting backstory.\n\nVisual: stunning and beautiful visual? i'd say it's hard to believe this VN is actually 5 years old.\n\nMusic: as expected from Tenmon, his soundtrack never fails to amuse me. The amazing soundtracks plays well with the story, strengthen the feelings gained from reading the story.\n\nEnding: for the ones that finished reading eden*, admit it. you saw it coming from miles away, but still, it kicked you pretty hard. The ending is just plain sad, but at a same time, it's kinda heartwarming.\n\nif you're going to buy this VN, trust me, you're not going to regret spending around 10 bucks for this. 9/10\n\n\n\n\nP.S: 11/10 wud cri evrytiem\n\n","February 28, 2015","true","12.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I had other kind of games that have visual novels, but this one was worth the price. The game can be incredibly dull at points, the story progresses is slow if you want to listin to the voice. Some parts were much longer than they needed to be, others were short, small feel of character playfulness, but a brilliant game. Recommended buy, only If you’re interested in visual novels or want to take them seriously as a medium eden.If you have the chance on buying something beautiful. It is tottaly worth it.\n\n__[Extra Info]__\nAnyone looking for an introduction to minori’s works or anyone looking to read one of the most polished VNs will be more than satisfied. If you don't like to read, or you don't like anime, you might not want to jump into the genre of visual novels due to that fact that you paid full price for this. Another fact is  that the great voice acting is kept in the native Japanese that i have heard for a while now. Certainly, if you're a fan of visual novels, check it out.\n\n__[How would i Recommend this game?]__\nFirst thing first, I would recommend this.

The story has so many feels and the characters are great, with just enough thought put into them to make you care about each one. As for the artwork, the backgrounds were breathtaking at times, and the character sprites, although limited, were also beautiful. One of the best aspects of this game though was the background music, and how it complemented the story perfectly.\n\nOverall an amazing visual novel. Great for those looking to get into visual novels as it has a relatively short story (it took me about 8 hours to read it all) and it does not have choices. The lack of choices might equate to a lack of replay value, but the fact that I don't have to go back and reread a large chunk of the story multiple times in order to get the ENTIRE story is something that I enjoy.\n\nBuy this game if you are looking to get a good taste of visual novels. Also, the funds collected from this game are going directly to the translation of the next game by this company.","February 8, 2015","true","10.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

So now, you maybe are thinking "Well, what's the difference between this and a book then", and the answer obviously lies in the way it's presented.\n\nVisual novels, as the name suggest, are like a book but with images. It sounds like "that's not interesting", but it is. Eden* has such a nice plot, and the visuals are wo gorgeus, so shinny and pretty, that I was like all the time "this is so beautiful" and "I'm hungry, but this is really good and I don't wanna stop". Now, as you know, games have soundtracks (not all the games but a lot of them), and this game has one that is perfect for the plot, I mean it.\n\nI metioned the plot, and as you migh've read in the synopsis, this story takes place in an ending world. I've seen some people complaining about the lack of explenation about what's causing this situation, but the story it's not really sci-fi, it's not really necessary for the player to understand the whys, the stroy wants only to tell us a wonderful tale about the last romance of this world, adding too much explanations will only obstruct this, so I think there's nothing wrong in that regard. Finally, while the game it's not so long, the way it is presented, with the animations, and lips sync, and the cgs, this thing makes this game a true work of art (come on, art's not only those things on the museum), so buy it an play it.\n\nThat's my review, a little messy, but oh well.\nPS: Dat ending.","June 17, 2015","true","1.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

And for those who do not wish to read the entire length of my review, a TL;DR is located at the end of the review summarizing my thoughts.\n\n[Synopsis] Over a hundred years ago, humanity learned of a humungous comet, one massive enough to obliterate Earth itself. Now, as the day of destruction closes in, most of the human race has already evacuated into space in search of a new beginning. This escape is largely due to the accomplishments of a woman named Sion - a genius scientist born as a part of a new race of intellectually-enhanced humans created for the sole purpose to find a method to counteract humanity's extinction. It was at this time that she met Ryo, a soldier seemingly void of life and purpose, who was ordered to become her bodyguard. Now, let the curtains rise on the last love story on earth…\n\n[Review] Eden* is undoubtedly one of the best and most touching VNs currently available on Steam, and is a must buy for anyone looking for a beautifully written and somber story accompanied by fantastic visuals and music. Though there are certainly flaws within the VN itself, I believe the pros far outweight the cons of this VN.\n\nPros:\n• Characters - Each and every one of the characters is written with care. Though each falls into a certain trope in their early stages of development, depth is carefully layered upon each character that far surpasses their original trope.\n• Music - Eden* has some of the most pleasantly somber tracks I've heard in any VN. Many classical instruments are used including the violin and the piano.\n• Voice Acting -\n• CG/Visuals -\n• Pacing -\n• Translation -\n\nCons:\n• Price - For a 10 to 15 hour VN (varies on whether you choose to use the autoplay feature and/or skip voice acting), $19.99 is a pretty high price. Though I'd love to say it's completely worth it, I'd recommended waiting for it to go on sale. Fortunately for me, I was able to pick Eden* up months after release in a very cheap Humble Bundle deal for less than a dollar.\n• Certain Facial Proportions - Eden* has some of the biggest eyes I've seen since CLANNAD, so for some it might be a turn off. Additionally, Ryou has the most awkward looking facial features in many of the CGs he's included in.\n• Minor Distracting Fanservice - Though fanservicey shots are used extremely rarely (taking up less than 5 minutes in total screentime), I find it still worth mentioning that there are a few CGs which included some unnecessary fanservicey elements to them.\n• User Interface - Compared to other VNs of similar quality, Eden* has a very basic UI.\n• Animations -\n• Plus MOSAIC (18+ additional content) - Entirely unnecessary. Unless for some reason you desire the eroge content the game offers separately (only available on MangaGamer), I wouldn't touch this.\n\nTL;DR:","September 12, 2015","true","12.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I played hours at a time, wanting to see what was next and was not disappointed. With some Visual Novels (VN), it should be pointed out there is no game here, there are no choices and this is purely a voiced graphical story similar to an amine or movie.  The voice actors were decent but were not able to live to full potential due to characteristics of some of the characters, but did as good as that would allow.\n\nThe art was well done, but with most VNs there were a lot of re used images at times but nothing detracted from the story. This version is rated for Everyone, but the original is Mature, however I do not feel anything was lost with a few scenes being implied instead of shown.\n\nOverall I am glad I picked this up, if you are new to this style of "game" I would recommend trying the demo (if still available) and maybe waiting for a sale on steam.

Partly because my backlog these days is so massive that it is more than a little overwhelming, and partly because I had a sense this game would probably make me sad. Turns out both of these are true, particularly the latter. ;_;\n\nBut... it's a nice little story. A bit predictable perhaps in that you can guess how it is going to end hours before it does, but not everything needs to surprise or shock. Also this is a "kinetic" novel, so there are no choices to make. Just read the text, listen to the voices, and look at the artwork.\n\nGood thing that all of those things are generally well-done. The art in particular stands out. The amount of CG's is staggering, the "regular" artwork looks just as good, and they even gave some attention to male characters here (unlike alot of other VN's XD). The voice acting works alright, and I was amused to find out that the male lead in this is voiced by someone who has voiced another male lead in one of the few romance VN's/animes that i've actually seen (Takasu Ryuuji from Toradora!). Lastly, I don't recall any parts of the text that seemed badly worded or mistranslated, so hooray for that.\n\nThe cast is fairly small, but they are interesting even if most of their backstories involve something they regret or wish for. The male lead Ryou starts off as a cynical emotionally dead soldier who has seen far too much violence and lost sight of what he is truly living for. The female lead Sion, despite looking like a loli and being way older than she looks, is a lonely high-functioning autistic who is a victim of her own genius and unable to really enjoy her life (sounds familiar ;_;). The rest of the cast, from the seemingly bubbly Lavie, the actually bubbly Maya, the caring big-sister figure Elica, and the regretful Major Inaba all play their parts in the story, but, since this is a romance, ultimately eden* is dominated by Ryou and Sion. As for them working as a couple... I've seen better, but I've also seen much worse. It's fine.\n\nSo it's a relatively short (<10 hours) KN with superb art and decent story/characters. Also being a VN with a serious and emotional plot without any fan service nonsense is always welcome to see on Steam. I liked it, don't regret playing it, and that's good enough for me. :3","August 6, 2015","true","16.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

(Not that they are necessarily bad games).\n\neden* however, is a completely different kind of novel from the differently garbed anime girls throwing themselves at the protagonist's feet in a different interpretation of love.\n\nThe basic premise of eden* is a love story between two very different individuals.\n\nRight off the bat, from the preview alone, the art, the music, the smooth animation already grabbed my attention.

The art, the characters, the voice acting, the music, the CGs, the finale and more. Each and every bit of eden* delivers and brings the story to life. To me, the story is not particularly long, at 7-8 hours, yet in game, that time is both fleeting and eternal. At times it feels so excruciatingly long, and at times it passes by so quickly.\n\nAnd the ending, my sweet merciful (whatever religious figure you believe in or don't for that matter), the ending.

To what extent justifies that a person is fully prepared? Or does a person even have to be fully prepared to face problems at all... eden* did a really wonderful answering each question I've thrown up.\n\nI've have to say that the number of VNs I've read can be counted with my fingers alone, but in any case, any good work would deliver perhaps more so to people that still sees something as fresh.\n\nI really liked the style the story presented itself. The players would already know what is going to happen in the end from just the title and the first few minutes of the game. A style that is rarely used but makes what happened at the beginning crystal clear by the end. A story that connected each character it has ever shown to have a significant impact which was truly amazing on how everything can be seen as these keys that slowly but truly opens the door to that one path.\n\nThe story (not giving a synopsis) is a simple one that means that character devolopments is key here. The way eden handled each relationships from family, friends, to even lovers were spendidly done. The lingering thoughts about someone important (aka flashbacks) really just shows the sentimental feeling and happiness from past events.\n\nThe art was stunningly beautiful especially with the scenes showing nature in its full glory. The OST (offical soundtrack) manages to further cultivate the already existing emotions formed by the art, story and words. Making each emotion and scene that much more powerful, which made it truly mesmerizing as the story reaches its envitable climax.\n\nI never was much of a person to use the word "melodramatic" (as I love drama), this VN though was a great feels ride that leaves this sense of satisfaction at the end to the point that there was no need to further tie any loose ends. Focusing on the important stuff with a fair pace, that is what truly matters afterall.","February 22, 2015","true","14.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Then, it breaks it at the end."\n\neden* is a visual novel game about Haruna Ryou, an adept special force agent, assigned to guard and protect the last hope of humanity, a felix named Sion. And from that encounter, there lives where destined to change.\n\nThis Visual Novel of Minori is absolutely one the best out there. As like every Visual Novel that Minori has made, this one doesn't have any choices and many routes. It has only one main route and one heroine but don't get taken back by these things because the story plot is totally solid and well-written. Every moment took me to the edge of my seat. What makes this VN standout is its way of affecting the player's emotions. The VN starts slow with but as you go deeper into the story, you begin to absorb the emotions expressed by each character. I don't know why but the VN's ending is quite predictable to me but the emotional delivery is what shot me down to tears.The VN has a great set of soundtracks as well. The visuals and art are totally magnificent. The protagonist is also voiced in this VN. (The protagonist's monologues are the only ones that are not voiced.)\n\nIf you're a big a big fan of Visual Novels then you can't possibly miss this one. If you're new to the genre, then as early as now, prepare your heart for something very emotional. I recommend this VN to those who are looking for a VN that is well written, has awesome visuals, great soudtracks and has a solid story plot.\n\nI can assure you, you won't be disappointed with this because after all, this is...\n\n\n...the last love story of the planet.\n\nMy Personal Rating:\nGraphics: 10/10\nMusic: 10/10\nPlot: 10/10\nGameplay: n/a (it's purely a Visual Novel, no decisions are made)\n\nOverall: 10/10","April 25, 2015","true","10.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","3","4","2","0"

I remember seeing it and having a grand amount of breathtaking moments with it. The story itself is fascinating however the route is limited and you are literally following through more of just a one route. Within the game, I fell in love with some of the characters and I do admit the game is great. To me this is a 9/10 work. Reason being is due to the nature of this game being pairing you with one route only. However it leaves much of you to think and as you go about realize a bit more about the characters and the settings. It's really drawn out and I admit playing this again brings back good memories. Now if we had this to come with the others previously over the years. Nonetheless this review is for this game, I recommend it for those looking for a VN with a breathtaking usage of work. Some would average it an 8 but I'll be honest, reading through it reminds me of relatable appreciation you have to some characters. However on buildup the 1 point lacking is routes, reason is we are all playing the same game then with the same result. A fundamental flaw that some many might not believe it to be but let's be honest, it's like seeing the same anime, just people get different views from it. Same with books. Moving on from that there seems a good backstory written to go with it but there seems to be some detachment less noted here which in my opinion could be included. The game itself has it's fine moments more than others I can say.","February 6, 2015","true","7.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I may update my review if I ever manage to finish this game or my opinion changes.\n\nI still remember the first visual novel I ever played. It had pretty bad graphics with broken anatomy for the character portraits, very few CG’s, 12 different soundtracks of horribly repetitive music, several flaws in its coding which made things confusing at times and not the best English. But the fact stood that a single person with English as a second language had worked and produced an amazing visual story with deep characters that touched the heart.\n\nEden* is the exact opposite. The graphics are beautiful, characters have animated eyes and mouths, there are a huge amount of CG’s, fully animated opening, beautiful soundtracks and sound effects, full voice-acting, perfectly coded and excellent English text. But Eden* with its mind-numbingly dull story and flat characters have succeeded in completely killing my interest for visual novels. Eden* is for some reason passed off as a visual novel but is really a kinetic novel.\n\nFrom the moment I started up Eden* I was bored, but told myself that I was being unfair and should play more before passing judgement. But no matter how much further I went things never turned out interesting and the story only became duller and duller. At certain parts of the story there were moments that could have been interesting but was completely cut out and skipped over because god forbid we have something remotely interesting.\n\nThe protagonist is Ryou Haruna who is the most perfect boy in the world, the best soldier of them all, dark and totally edgy, has a dark past and charms all the girls simply by existing. He is a terrible person but the story progresses as if he’s a good person with characters magically being in love with him and completely trusting him for no reason.\n\nOther characters include Sion who is the most perfect loli in the world, the most intelligent being on the planet despite not being able to wash her own hair and everyone calls her “the messiah”. Elica who is a ditzy maid that takes care of Sion. Lavinia who gets her panties wet over bladed weapons and Inaba who drinks on the clock.\n\nI couldn’t for my life care for any of the characters or their backstories and only found them infuriating. Every character’s personality is horribly typical and cookie-cutter. All I needed was an introduction and then I had immediately grasped their entire character and could predict their actions from there on. The conversations between the characters are so flat and unrealistic it feels like everyone is talking to a wall.\n\nWhen I read the description, saw all the good reviews and saw that it was developed by the popular Minori I honestly expected a good story with deep characters. For the first time I wish that Steam issued refunds. The only consolation I have is that I bought it on sale so I didn’t suffer the full blow of the 20 euro that this game is selling for.\n\nI would not recommend this for anyone with regular standards. If you however have a strong liking for dull storytelling, underdeveloped characters, anime characters whom look like they’re 12 years old and old-fashioned cheesy drama this would satisfy your needs.","July 7, 2015","false","3.0"," 34 of 65 people (52%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","52","34","65","3","0"

Probably one of the most striking things about this kinectic novel are the amazing visuals. The animation for the character's eyes and mouths immerses you far more than most VNs. Another great thing is putting the game on "auto" mode and displaying it on your HD TV really makes you feel as if you are watching an anime movie rather than simply reading a visual novel. I HIGHLY recommend playing the game this way for the best experience. The characters themselves I thought were quite interesting and deep, although I would have liked to learn more about them.\nThis game goes through a lot of emotions and you definitely go through these emotions while reading. I often empathized with the characters, felt sad when they were sad, or hopeful when something good happened.\n\nNow for the stuff I didn't like too much: this VN is WAY too short. I was actually surprised at how quickly I read through it on auto mode (which is WAY slower than if I would read it myself). I read it in only 6 hours on the slowest mode! I find this to be far too short for a game like this that depends on character development. I actually wanted to learn about the early lives of the Felixes, more about Lavie, and have more interaction with Elica, who I felt needed more screentime (she was REALLY underdeveloped compared to the other characters I felt).\n\nI think if it were even 1/3rd longer, it would be a much better story. Some people actually thought this game was longer, but it's really too short compared to most VNs in the same genre.\n\nThat's really the only glaring problem about this VN. The length. Especially since you are paying $20 for it, although the production values likely ramp up the price a bit which I can understand.\n\nI do recommend getting this game regardless, it's a great story.","March 1, 2015","true","6.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/silentcaay/recommended/315810/","silentcaay","SilentCaay","http://steamcommunity.com/id/silentcaay/","247 products in account","A powerful story about love, life and what it means to live. The story involves the final days of the planet Earth which may seem like a cheap way to inject drama but, honestly, that part of the story may as well be an aside. The fact is that the main story is between our two main characters and it could have just as well been told in another setting while still remaining as powerful. It's very well written with one caveat...\n\nThe pacing for the first half is incredibly slow. If you're not a patient person, you may have trouble dragging yourself through it. Speed reading or skimming along until the main characters get together wouldn't be a terrible idea if you feel yourself getting disinterested because there is a great ending to this story, despite the slow start. This is a long story and they get together at about the midway point so you won't be robbing yourself of much by skimming a bit. Lastly, just an FYI, this is a kinetic novel meaning there are no choices, branching paths or interactions.\n\nAs far as the artwork goes, it's mostly top-notch. The characters are often incorporated into the backgrounds instead of the standard VN format of having a background layer with static "pop-up" characters in front of it. There are a few frames of Major Inaba that are comically bad and I question how they ended up in the game when the rest is so well drawn but aside from that, it's all very beautiful.\n\nIn summary, it's a great story if you have the time (and a little patience) to put into it. A bit slow to start but it has a fairly powerful finish. I recommend it.","October 9, 2015","true","15.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IHaveQuitDota/recommended/315810/","IHaveQuitDota","あんハピ♪ [Serment]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IHaveQuitDota/","7 products in account","I have pre-ordered this game a long time ago and actually haven't touched it for a while, having forgotten about it after a while.. One day, my internet was ♥♥♥♥ed, so I was desperately searching for some kind of source for entertainment and spotted this game on my desktop, which made me think - "Oh, this game, I completely forgot about it!". The first couple of hours into the game, I was constantly wondering how this story was going to expand from here, because for me, the ending was spoiled, due to the nature of the description given to this game. This, I thought, might make the whole VN underwhelming, but I was completely wrong. The overall shell of this VN is easy to figure out, in the early stages of this VN I couldn't help but be sceptical overall about this. The whole trailer type video shown in this page is also a big spoiler for me, as it shows the two main characters already in the mellow state. I couldn't stop wondering about how these two main characters, both seemingly cold-blooded with no humane emotions to be seen, were going to develop. This VN starts off in an oddly relaxing manner, it feels like this game's just going around in circles with its story at times, but after having finished this game, I can't help but appreciate the amount of time I was given to get attached to the characters (deeply, deeply attached). The pacing is incredible, looking back at how the whole entire story has unfolded, in a slow, majestic manner. This game knows to take its time with the story. This game seems to have all the time in the world, contrary to the inhabitants of this small world, the measly human race, desperately struggling to survive the end of the world. Things seem uneventful, duty for the main male protagonist also lacking any kind of action. The seemingly static storyline put me off at first, but as I've mentioned before, this is crucial for this story to have any kind of impact on your feelings, so bear with me on this and this game will show you its worth in full display. Something which has caught my attention very early on into this game is - the incredible dialogue between characters, it's seemingly flawless and the usage/timings of specific words are impeccable, they were incredibly poetic and have made me quite envious of the writer! The way this story develops is simply amazing, I couldn't expect when or how this story would expand, due to the nature of this VN, only sloooowly..and slooooowly.. revealing each and every part of the story, completely trapping me in the game, unable to stop pressing the space bar! I was so absorbed into this game, I had forgotten that it has become midnight, I had forgotten to breathe regularly and ended up having to do it manually! (I guess that's what you call "breathtaking"?) Once the story had started to gain momentum in the storytelling aspect, it has gotten too interesting for me to let go of and time was seemingly flying! (though my clock says otherwise) The main female (Sion) protagonist's character development is astonishing, I knew something had to happen in her for this to be the "Earth's last love story", same goes for the male protagonist. And I was correct, something DID happen (what a surprise). The game had become a feels trip, I cried so many times and so much that I've lost count. "I have become too attached for my own good.." is what I was mumbling, while wiping my tears. *sniff* Yes, if you're wondering about the art and all the other things in this masterpiece, you won't be disappointed, though I expect you've already seen this game's trailers and what not, the art just gets better and better, same with the soundtracks, so you won't need to worry about these aspects being a potential sacrifice in order for them to have created the incredibly immersive and simply touching story. Sion's VA is incredible, she has simply pummelled my heart constantly, with her flawlessly delivered, impactful lines. So I have looked her up on the internet, only to find that she doesn't seem to be well-known at all and by that I mean - she hasn't been a part of many games/anime/vns so on so forth and it's very saddening for me, as I was ready to watch/read what other great things she might have had in store. This is the first game to make me feel my heart wrench, I have actually felt the pain in my chest and the inability to calm myself down from the sadness during and after. The ending of this game has left me in a dazzled state. As the credits were rolling, I was simply staring up ,while lying on my chair, thinking about nothing, absolutely nothing, as this game has left me speechless, accompanied by the feeling of emptiness.\n\nI give this game 10/10 with no doubt, this deserves more than just a glimpse. Delve into it, experience true melancholy and a feeling of amazement, followed by the feeling of accomplishment after having finished this game, which is truly worth your time.","November 3, 2015","true","10.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But you have to have a quiet time for it.\nIt would be a waste of a great experience if you had music or childs or whatever intrude into the immersion.\n","March 26","true","7.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It felt like a few scenes dragged on for a split second too long, and some of the sound effects (such as when someone's stomach rumbles) sounded a bit strange.\n\nOther than that everything was great, and I definitely recommend eden*.\n\nTip: If you want to play the game in "full screen" I recommend using the program Borderless Gaming.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hukdora/recommended/315810/","hukdora","Hukdora","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hukdora/","694 products in account","A well illustrated visual novel, with a moving, although somewhat empty story. Set in the future, the earth is facing its destruction due to causes left largely unexplained. The protagonist Ryou is sent to guard a secret facility. The facility was used to research a new genetically modified form of human with hyper intelligence. These modified 'felixes' were used to research and design the ships to be used to escape the destruction of the planet. The story is told half through flashback about the events surrounding Ryou, and the final days of the doomed planet.\n\nUltimately however the story comes off as somewhat unsatisfactory. Due partially to its nature as a kenetic visual novel. There are no choices, and no options for further reading. The game presents a lot of interesting material, but it is entirely set within either the research facility or the countryside. There is little to no opportunity to learn about the rest of the world. Ultimately this is a love story between the hero and heroine, and the rest takes a backseat with no chance to bring to light anything about the interesting background world. If you like a romance, this is a very good one. But it falls quite flat in other areas. Particularly as the story is actually at its core very simple and straightforward, it could take place in any setting with minor modifications. It therefore doesn't make the best use of the world nor characters it has come up with.\n\nPros:\n\n- Overall well illustrated, pleasing on the eyes.\n- Mostly realistic, likeable characters. No airheads or stupidity here.\n- Decent length; my playtime is slightly inflated, it should take around 6-8 hours to complete.\n\nCons:\n\n- Character illustrations ocassionally off model.\n- Very limited animation, some lip-flap and blinking is the extent of animation.\n- Kenetic story means no opportunity to explore areas of personal interest.","February 1, 2015","true","8.7"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","2"

Now you can buy Eden* or Eden* plus mosaic that is basicly the H version of this game. i havent finished the game as of yet but i think after so many hours i can give a solid enough review.\nSo,\nPros- Well the art works amazing. Really well done, sometimes tho i feel like Ryou's face looks ♥♥♥♥♥ wierd in some scenes LOL\nMusic- the music in this really suits the scenes, i wish few parts it would of varied a little bit but asides from that really good soundtracks. love them!\nVoice acting- The voice acting. You can really feel the emotions from the characters, and actually get attached to them , feel theres moods ect. You can tell they werent dragging on with this game as the voice acting is superb.\nCons- a few things that got me confused was how the story starts, its like, it goes in the future stops goes in past then vise versa at the start but i think i was just tired when i started so i like derping out. Buut once you get in things start to be explained and it gets REALLY intresting.\nWhen you try going in fullscreen mode it doesnt really fill the entire screen that isint really a bad thing just for me kinda anoyed me i dont know why lol\n\nIs this game worth it?

My first impression was something like "Kazami Yuuji meets Reverie Planetarian" but the end result was a rather weak plot.   Planetarian made me cry like a child and Grisaia made me gasp, but Eden didn't make me shed a single tear.\n\nComparison with other VNs aside, the story in general was pretty bland. Whatever excitement I got from the "research facility" arc disappeared completely in the arcs that followed. It's like they tried to follow the mirror image of the plot mountain, starting with the climax and ending with exposition. The story became some bland slice-of-life between Gary Stu and Mary Sue. It did a good job tying plot elements together but it all felt unnecessary towards the end, messily resolving any conflict.\n\nIt's a well-spent 10+ hour story, a calming ride, a relaxing experience... but it doesn't feel like it's worthy of its high ratings.

It often felt like the dialogue was way too drawn out. I just couldn't care about the characters at all. It had some sweet moments and a few laughs but the drama itself fell flat. I feel like they could have cut out half of the dialogue and nothing would have been lost.\n\nThey built an interesting world but never really explored it at all.\n\nAlso a lot of people say that this VN doesn't benefit from the H scenes that the 18+ version offers. I would have to agree, but they didn't sufficiently edit the PG version which lead to some really awkward dialogue that didn't seem to fit in with the tone of the story. It felt like *lewd comment that leads to H scene* > *scene missing* > *comment about said H scene*.\n\nEDIT: I have since been informed that the Steam version and PLUS + MOSAIC versions dialogue are exactly the same and that the H scenes are part of the extras. I guess in that case I have to call into question the writing, given how really out of place some of the diakogue is. /EDIT\n\nI can't fault the art, music and voice acting which is actually quite good but everything else is very bland.

Don't read them unless you played the game or you are not going to.\n\nPretty much sweet story about a girl that is involved on providing people optiom to escape from a Earth to a different planet because 'world's end' is knocking at the door. She's been genetically modified, which resulted in abiloty to live longer life, but she was 'made' to just help with creation of the space ships. Thus she was locked in the facility, which means she couldn't see outer world while it was one of her wishes.\n\nPros:\nGreat art and animation\nWell-fitting BGM\nGame is mild in overall. There are no erotic or especially profane parts - It had the exact amount of violence it needed. R18 version does indeed improve few parts, but the ero-scenes are in special section so this part of game is not afflicted.\nTouching story, none of VN/eroge I played was actually this powerful. Sad things are often not even worth dropping a tear for, but minori moved these situations on next level. Actually it did not really move me when Inaba died, but when Ryuu burried his beloved and only girl on this world it really made me drop a tear or two.\nThe story is straight - No choices. It usually happens that if you finish another VN by bad ending, then it does clearly say what is going to happen in other endings, thus one ending avoided this.\nCons:\nIn comparison with R18 version, it had some huge censorship, for example blood is completely removed, that kind of decreases the emotions.\nI firsly said that I shall wait for sale or when it is in bundle. Bought it for full price, but I do not regret a single cent now.\n\n10/10","July 3, 2015","true","122.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

That said, I'm pretty sure this is the longest kinetic on steam, most sit around just 2 or so hours, eden* meanwhile clocks in closer to 10.\nYes, there is an 18+ version of this game (and the version I played) but it should be noted that there is  NO sexual content within the story at all, so you lose nothing of the main storyline in playing the all ages. The sexual content comes in the way of 4 extra scenarios you can play after the game, that for the most part are contradictory to the main story. Its pure fanservice. If you wish to purchase that version, you can do so at mangagamer.com and they will also provide a free steam key for the all ages version.\nThere is ALOT of artwork in this game. Most VN's are content to use the same set of character portraits over various backgrounds, but eden* very rarely uses these instead choosing to have entirely new artwork for almost every diaglogue scene in the game, and these include some basic animation (blinking and mouth movement). And its all of a high standard.\n\nSidenote: I played this game in offline mode, so steam failed to track my actual playtime, good jerb 8v","June 5, 2015","true","1.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The art work is very well done as are the characters also Elica was my favorite.Now I dont see why they censored the gore in this. Its not like any one was cut into little bits or anything so it was like why?. Anyways It's worth buying if your into visual novel games 10/10.\n\nNow if you happen to get the other version from MangaGamer Eden Plus+Mosaic that was awsome. Still the same game\nthey justed added the gore back into it and added 4 side storys. Each side story was about 30min so add an extra 2 hours to the game.

Right off the bat I wasn't impressed with this as almost every story I've seen try to incorporate this type of storytelling has been worse off for it. It doesn't reveal much but if you're even the least bit keen you can piece together what will ultimately happen within the first 40 minutes of the game (estimated game time is anywhere from 5hrs-9hrs depending on your reading speed and if you listen to voices). Another problem with this is that it's obvious the game is going for a bittersweet ending, which relies heavily on having the reader build some sort of attachment to the characters. Unfortunately this doesn't pan out because almost every character is a played out archetype, combine this with the heavy-handed delivery of the drama and what you're left with is a slightly grating experience that feels familiar in many ways. If you've never experienced anything like this you'll probably enjoy it but at the end of the day I just can't recommend it to experienced readers. Two things that the game did do well though are the music and production values. For such a short game they really layed it on with the CGs, and the soundtrack was very fitting without being overly generic/forgettable.","March 8, 2015","true","6.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

A galge publisher which I will forever remember by IP blocking all non-Japanese visitors and blame all of us gaijin as responsible for their own country tightening laws regarding erotic games.  How does a game from a publisher like that get an official English translation and got put on Steam is beyond my imagination.\n\nOf course, you all know this is Steam, thus there is absolutely no conventional erotic content in this visual novel.  Forgive me being too lazy to search the internet on whether the actual sex scene got cut for the English release, or was it nonexistent in the original version.  It is irrelevant, because a sex scene in eden*’s story and the mood would be an intrusion, rather than enhancement, and I’m glad that there is none for me to see.\n\nAlthough far from being a bad vn compare to rest of the genre on Steam, I don’t feel eden* is worth of the $20 asking price.  Gorgeous background CGs coupled with dubious character sprites/portraits of inconsistent style; nicely tuned soundtrack but eclipsed by mediocre voice acting… I can’t pin down what exactly went wrong in the production phase… but something definitely was amiss for such swing of quality in different departments.\n\nStory of eden* is largely a fairytale-ish romance.  (And by “romance” I don’t just mean a love story, but rather a tale of emotion and human nature.)  Background setting: The world’s scientists somehow are convinced that the world will end in about 100 years.  World war then broke out; half of human population died, and the rest formed a unified government and started to build spaceships.  The plan is successful; nearly everybody on Earth got evacuated in the end, and the story really begins on one couple who chose to remain on Earth to live together and eventually faces the inevitable.\n\nOf course, there would be a few more to the story than that which I would not spoil.  The plot does introduce a few more elements to aspire intrigue and perhaps the readers’ tear… but when the time comes, the ending is largely predictable.  I know it’s beside the point and focus, but the vn never tried to explain what exactly is the nature of this “Armageddon” event, and the story doesn’t elaborate on it, deliberately I shall say, which is irritating even more.\n\nSo in the end, I feel the story couldn’t leave a positive impact.  It is partly due to the premise of the story is built too much on a hypothetical and fantasy world setting that is far too removed from current reality.  Or maybe I’m just not into love stories about people who know their life would soon end.  It is fine, though, like not all people enjoy horror game/movies and not all like the science fiction genre.\n\nIn conclusion, if you dig for a story like this, then you can safely ignore everything I wrote above.  Otherwise I would advise caution, because in the end the experience which this vn brings might very likely not worth the money—and more importantly, the time—you spend reading.","January 5","false","8.4"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","7","16","2","0"

I feel like I have been rick rolled, like this game was a gag and I'm waiting for the punchline. Don't get me wrong, I have a heart and can find romance in games wonderful if told right. To the Moon is a great modern example.\n\nThis game game just never captivated me for a second, and when I saw the credits role I laughed out loud, not believing that is the end.\n\nSo in this game world, there are only 2 men, the protagonist and one other guy just to show that this isn't about young girls and their love for cold, strong killers. Every single other character is an incredibly immature (in appearance and behavior) girl who all fall in love with the protagonist at some point (yep, every single girl) at some point.\n\nThe protagonist is a 2 dimensional killer, who says the most outrageous and plain weird things (your face is too big) but is turned into a "human" again by the 100 year old in a 12 year old body.... yeah, I'm open... Lolita was a great book/ movie, but it had a point. It felt like this whole premise of this game was just a males hot fantasy about innocent, naive, defenseless young girls (yeah yeah she's 100... keep telling yourself that.)\n\nThe content is painfully immature, I am a lover of literature, and I must admit this is my first true visual novel, and first dip into Manga and I am shocked at the banality and two-dimensionality story telling found here. It was as if it was written by a young 20 year old male, with no higher education, who has got stuck in his high school fantasies of hooking up with the 1st grade newbies.\n\nThat this visual novel comes so highly recommend by a variety of sources brings me to wonder and awe at the other "Delights"that are out there for me never to read.\n\n8 hours of my life that I will never get back.

I didn't care much for his backstory.\nAlthough I loved the idea of spending time focussing heavily on characters and how characters interact with each other, it felt more like everyone was just magically in love with you even though you're a terrible person who hasn't actually gotten to know anyone. No one has any reason to trust or like you, but for some reason the game progresses as if you've been a good person.\nYou literally catch a girl having a bath, watch her, point a gun at her, tell her to get dressed in front of you while you watch and think about how she deserves worse treatment, then check every nook, cranny, and inch of her body physically before tying her up so tight it leaves marks and leaving her all night in a storage room so hot and with air so thick she couldn't even breathe properly. She decides she's in love with you and later kisses you goodbye.\n\nI think that the voice acting is great, the artwork is beautiful, I love that it's animated to blink. I think there was a very cool plot idea, despite it not being delved into as much as I'd prefer.\n\nI do NOT recommend this game.","April 10, 2015","false","8.3"," 37 of 83 people (45%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","45","37","83","4","5"

The closest to some story telling game I ever enjoy is things like Firewatch or Dear Esther, or I just grab a Warhammer 40k book instead and be happy with that.\n\nSo in final, if you are like me, just don't bother with this, if your friend is trying to gift this, don't accept, don't let him waste his money to you with it.

I wish I'd remembered that it was a Minori game -- I'm not a fan of the company for various reasons. I'm also not the target audience for this particular type of story, as the prospect of romance with Sion is not one I find appealing, so others may find value in this story that I didn't.\nAt a glance, the visuals of eden* are really impressive; they are technically adequate (I like the weathering effects on Elica's old radio, for example), but after a while you start to feel surfeited by the sheer volume of sweeping plains, elaborate vintage mansions, and dramatic winds constantly blowing the characters' hair around even when they're indoors. That's right, instead of static images, mouths move and eyes blink, which is (again) technically cool but also kind of weird. If you leave it on while making a sandwich or whatever, they'll just keep blinking, frozen in time. Spooky. The basic designs of the characters are generic, and everyone looks about half the age they're theoretically supposed to according to the text -- it's unintentionally hilarious when a vaguely teenage-looking dude announces "I'm not thirty yet" as if this is news. Of course all the girls have pretty much the same face (then again, that's true for 90% of visual novels, so it's hard to fault them for this). The opening theme is extremely nice, and I've no complaints about the background music or sound effects, which are serviceable enough. Sion's voice actress is the only one I found pleasant to listen to; I am grateful to Minori for including the option to turn off individual characters' voices, as this meant that I didn't have to listen to Lavinia.\nThe story here is that oh snap, the Nibiru people were right and the planet is going to be destroyed. The main character, who absolutely everyone falls over themselves to assure us is Totally Cool and Very Strong and The Perfect Soldier, is suddenly stationed at a remote research facility to act as a guard. It transpires that the reason they needed The Coolest And Strongest And Most Perfect Soldier is that The Smartest And Most Beautiful And Most Perfect Little Girl works at the facility. Apparently most of humanity is either dead from a massive war or in the process of leaving Earth on ships engineered by TSAMBAMPLG, so she is not just the smartest person ever (which she is, because she's the smartest of ALL the genetically engineered smart people), she is also the most important person ever. (Seriously, the other characters refer to her as "The Messiah" and literally dream of so much as catching a glance of her. Evidently the writer wanted to make sure absolutely no one missed just how wonderful and special these people are.) In practice, protecting TSAMBAMPLG entails sitting around chatting with several attractive ladies, followed by assassinating the evil spies who are trying to kill TSAMBAMPLG. The story routinely elides scenes that could conceivably be interesting (come on, a fade to black before the welcome party?) and telegraphs future plot elements with such gusto that readers are likely to sigh "finally!" when the main character finally figures out whatever was spelled out an hour or two ago. It's like trying to tell Dora that Boots is behind the box with this guy.\nI was told by review after review that eden* had incredibly compelling characters, and so I was a bit put out, to be honest. I didn't find myself empathizing with Ryou at all, and honestly found him incredibly creepy, given the way he becomes obsessed with Sion after talking to her for maybe ten minutes. Sion herself is the "genius girl with no people skills or self-care abilities" archetype that can be found in a million other games, including compatriot Steam VN World End Economica; the standard hand-wave of a childlike character actually being super old is in play, because Minori knows very well how to make money hand over fist. Other characters include Elica, a mischievous and slightly ditzy maid (of course) who takes care of TSAMBAMPLG's everyday needs but seems to have a Dark Secret, and Lavinia or "Lavie", who is probably one of the most annoying characters I've encountered in some time. There's also the Major, who drinks and hits on civilian maids while on the clock and also has a Dark Secret. I'm used to stories in general at least having some sort of break point or divider when the POV changes, so I was jarred and confused when sometimes Ryou left the scene and the narration sort of hung around for a bit -- telling us what other characters are thinking or doing, often related to how awesome Ryou is -- before remembering that it had places to be and skedaddling back to Ryou without warning.\nIf you hunger for cheesy drama and animu chicks, especially those that are "totally like a hundred years old, so it's cool", this game has you covered. (The Clannad comparison made in other reviews seems apt.) There aren't really standing sprites and the overall presentation is supposed to evoke a movie, so it's not that different from watching a film that requires regular mouse clicks to advance. Still, as far as this type of game goes, I'd much sooner recommend Narcissu or Moonshine. eden* is just not for everyone.","March 6, 2015","false","2.6"," 31 of 74 people (42%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","42","31","74","6","5"

After all I enjoy stories with substance and content that can be emotionally provocative, which, if you were to read the reviews, eden is just that.\nExcept it isn't.\n\nUnlikeable characters:\nMain character is a stereotypical Gary Stu war-hardened soldier whose inner dialogue takes up at least 60% of the reading which usually wouldn't be a bad thing if it wasn't for the fact that the subject matter of the inner dialogue is always about how emotionless he is. There is hardly any character development, so this doesn't change much. He isn't a good person, not even in a Byronic hero sort of way, and acts like a sociopath, yet still people like him. Okay.\nOther main character, Sion, is the typical 100+ year-old "woman" trapped in the body of a prepubescent girl with no personality. That's really all there is to her.\nEven when these characters finally show some semblance of emotion, it doesn't provoke any empathy because their backstories are shallow and their characters have hardly been fleshed out at all.\nThe rest of the characters are either similarly of little depth or are entirely shoehorned in, possibly for the sake of offering some temporary distraction from the otherwise boring plot that seems to drag on forever. By the time any action scenes do occur, you're already numb to what's happening after laboriously clicking/scrolling through the boring "muh stoicism" thoughts of the main character.\n\nThe animation isn't bad and neither is the music, although I found it to be noticeably repetitive at times.\nAt the end of the story, the non-canon, 18+ Plus Mosiac content is unlocked. Not expecting much I decided to open it because I was curious. Surely they wouldn't make the pacing of the non-canon 18+ scenes as mind-numbing as the main story. Nope. It too dragged on for so long I gave up and closed the window before anything involving hentai/18+ happened.","July 27, 2015","false","0.2"," 9 of 27 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","9","27","0","0"

It was a great way to jump into the visual novel genre.  As a kinetic novel, you play through the game like reading a book, with no options for the player to make choices to influence the storyline.\n\nBut just because the playstyle was hands-off, it didn't lack in other departments.  The graphics are so beautiful - I am really drawn to games that are visually striking, where the art style is detailed and high quality.  This game is definitely gorgeous to look at, which is a major plus because I played the game for close to 20 hours.\n\nAnother thing I really liked is how the characters aren't static.  On any particular scene, the characters' eyes blink, giving the "page" a little extra visual oomph.  The scenes also change slightly every few sentences, making it seem like the characters are moving - a tilt of the head, a turn of the body, movement of the arms - they all add up to make the characters appear fluid when they are actually standing still for most of the game.\n\nThe storyline is a little more militaristic than I expected, but still enjoyable.  Warning!  This novel is a tearjerker!  There are several character deaths, which was very difficult for me to get through. I loved their personalities and backstories, and it was heartbreaking to watch them die.\n\nDespite the sad parts, I would absolutely play this game again.  The artistry is magnificent, and the characters are intriguing and lovable.

This Visual Novel has no choices to speak of or alternate routes, so replay value (in terms of alternate content - I'm okay with just replaying the same thing if it's good) is a bit limited.

The art is so beautifully done that even looking at some of the same pieces again and again, it never gets tiring.\n\nMy only real complaint with Eden* is during some scenes the character's face looks out of proportion. I only noticed it on Sion, but I saw it at several different parts. Also the menu in the bottom right isn't very smooth, but that's a very minor flaw in my eyes.","February 16, 2015","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I found the Story to be decent despite some lingering questions.  Spelling mistakes in the english dialogue were pretty minimal and easily ignored.  I didn't have difficulty understanding it for the most part.\n\nThe Artwork was great although I found male characters to be sloppy compared to female characters.  There were nice touches like blinking eyes and moving mouths.  The mouths unfortunately don't always move during speech and while playing the visual novel in windowed mode the mouth was somewhat unnoticeable for me at times.\n\nThe Sound was good throughout although you will hear certain tracks (if not all of them) over and over again which can become annoying but the music is good and the voicework while it was abit irritating at a certain point early on it was for the most part solid.\n\nThere really isn't any Gameplay but atleast I could save where I was and continue it later at anytime.  The most you can control aside from that is the flow of the story, window or fullscreen resolution and voicework.  If you just want to sit back and enjoy a story eden* will accomplish that.

I personally would have liked that they would have spent more time in the first half to expand some of the minor characters a bit more.\n\nThe art is pretty good and there are quite a few good landscape shots.

Nope.\n\nIs this game worth a read? Yes.\n\nAs expected of a minori game there is quite a bit of effort put into the visuals and music. Also as with a lot of their games the beginning lags a little bit in terms of pace due to heaping on the world building and dialogue but this is to be expected by now. This is a good choice of a minori game to come out on steam, though I'm surprised this came out at all due to how xenophobic they were (in no small part due to a cultural conflict earlier in the millenium that totally had nothing to do with overzealous double-standards feminism and certain nukige(pr0n game) makers).\n\nNegatives:\nWell then, lets start with some negatives since I feel like a pessimistic pete today.\nDespite all that world building you hear of in the beginning, the game just ends up throwing you into a completely different place soon after and leaving you there. Admittedly the setting DOES play a large part in shaping the characters, enough that it could be said to be the antagonist itself but why spend all that time talking about the military and the setting if you're going to throw "perfect murder mystery island" out that quickly?\n\nTropes are abound in this game. For example, the thousand year old albino loli/petite girl or the bimbo large-cup-size maid or the mentally challenged blonde twin-tails, or the "I'm vicious but clearly a tsundere" girl or the stoic gary stu super soldier. I realize you can't perpetually avoid tropes when you write... But this cast. Why? Just why? Did they just throw traits in a hat and draw characters or something?\n\nAs is minori's style the regular dialogue is normal at best, all their charm in their writing seems to  come from their drama. Or it's been like that as far as I know. It hardly needs saying that the large-cup-size yandere girl in natsuzora no perseus(another minori game) is going to have subpar plot compared to terminal illness girl. (Well her "plot" is larger.) There was less drama-llama hence it was worsererer.\n\nPositives:\nOverall tastiness.\n\nOooooo pretty pictures.\nBeing a kinetic novel this is essentially the feeling of watching a movie, and minori certainly didn't slouch with CG or the regular character art and backgrounds. As always their opening movies, animation and art are a visual treat.\n\nTenmon delivers the nomnomnom music. BGM isn't shabby either\n\nTasty albino loli.\n\nSad girls and seasonal themes.\n\nThis is a tragedy and a pretty predictable one at that but still, it was tragedy done right. It's pretty hard to screw up on tragedy (look at anything by key) but this still delivered in the end.\n\nConclusion:\nThe overarching theme (besides delicious flat chest) would probably be identity. The young man finally finds/reinvents himself and is able to find the best ending that could be had without turning the novel into a classic comic ripoff.\n\nNot bad.\n\n7.8 stereotypical characters out of 10 stereotypical characters.","March 10, 2015","true","23.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story was simply a master peace, and was very griping and emotional. The plot over all was pritty preditable after the first half, however the VN was not going for some crazy twists. Just a simple love story, that they nailed out of the park. Overall reading this at about a medum pace, I finished in about 6 hours, if you want to power-read (and skip over the great music) you can probably finish in about 4 hours.\n\nSome negative aspects in my option are the amount of game-play was a little short, but that could just be me wanting more of this great story. Another huge negative, this VN has you making no choices, despite the fact their are about 4 "choice options" were the main character chooses for you. It is almost as if the writer wanted a branching story and got in a fight with the director who wanted a linar story. This aspect makes the game have zero replayablaty. 6 hours, you cry, your done. Keep this in mind.\n\nAs far as the little extras go, the do have a "memories" section that allow you to look at sceens that you have already cleared, as well as listion to music already played. This section is pritty standed in most VN, what I am sad about is they dont have a screen-shot download (as far as I can tell) for the sceens, which is sad considering the art is pritty high quality. Another disaponting aspect is (as far as I can tell) can't buy the sound track through steam (or anywere really.)\nTL;DR great game, missing some bells and whistles.","August 11, 2015","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is a kinetic novel, a visual novel that plays without any player decisions. It compares more with a novel or a movie, so those looking for anything resembling 99% of video games should look elsewhere, but those who are looking for an excellent story may look no further.\n\nAs a game that is entirely based upon story, eden* delivers.\n\neden* is a character-driven experience. Plot twists are used sparingly, and the story flows about as how you would expect. It is in the characters that the game shines. None of them resemble any cookie-cutter archetypes, especially those commonly found in anime or other visual novels. They feel human. They have a million different things on their mind, and the emotions attached to them are incredibly complex, and the game isn't afraid of discussing those conflicts inside each of those characters. It is especially apparent with the two lead characters' interactions; they understand each other's complexities almost absurdly well. It's a great joy seeing them change in even some minute ways as they face the very end.\n\nThe orchestral soundtrack is excellent and accents the story very well. The visuals are refreshingly more dynamic than most other visual novels, showing scenes from "camera angles" beyond the usual cut-and-paste sprite approach. Hearing different voices in different ears depending on the placement of the "camera" is a nice touch if you wear headphones.\n\nAs for downsides, the game is a little short. My record is a little bloated from semi-frequent breaks and waiting to hear all of the voice acting before continuing. The story was sweet enough that I didn't care.\n\nThe pacing might be a little slow in the beginning. The game definitely takes its time introducing the characters' quirks and histories. Again, eden* is a character-driven experience, so I didn't mind since that's partly why the characters felt so complex.\n\nFinishing the game made me want more, yet the feeling of closure to the character's inner struggles also made me feel satisfied. Loved it from beginning to end.","August 4, 2015","true","16.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

I couldn't figure out how to pause, or save the game, or even exit without risking losing my save. So, I sat, and I played the entire game in a single sitting in 10 hours.\n\nThere is a lot about this that I can say makes it a gripping story. Weither it is the underlying theme of romance, or returning to a normal life after being in the military, or perhaps you are more keen, and observe the nature of humanity that is talked about on both sides of the spectrum, without good or evil to make notice.\n\nThe main character reminded me a lot about some of the returning military personel in my family, never truely having that off switch until they found something to really grind them into the now. I read how some people say that the main character is unlikeable. He is not supposed to be, because he cannot bring it upon himself, to like himself. and you feel that.\n\nTL:DR\nThis game will make you feel.

Having known this for 100 years a certain someone was instrumental in creating a space program so man could escape. People were not given a choice on if they could stay and die so many were outraged. Some also refused to believe the end would ever come. Thus the world has been in a constant state of martial law style war. The main male character is former special forces and a ruthless killer in his own eyes totally full of sin. Will he and the countless other people he meets find an internal sense of redemption or a way to atone for the immense guilt they feel?\n\nPositive\nWell obviously art and sound are top notch for a VN. I mean just watch the preview video. The story has a nice way of coming full circle and telling stories within stories. The whole story itself is by no means short like most VN titles bosting over 10 hours of story.\n\nNegative\nIt ends up very difficult for a rational person to find any point in some of the decisions made since there is really no reason things had to turn out so heart wrenching if you think about it after your done with the game. This is a kinetic novel so choices do not exist. It's actually kind of a shame that choices don't exist because the option to make this into a Clannad type visual novel would have made more sense even if the story suffered slightly. In the end this game reminded me a lot of Clannad the anime series because it felt like it was purposely set up for feels even when it didn't make a whole lot of sense.\n\nConclusion\nIf you don't mind emotional stories with well developed characters this is a must. So far it is the best VN I've experience on steam easily beating the rest. Unlike many other steam VN's that have hentai on other sites this one has it available on other sites, but it actually is separate and makes little sense with the game if you go that route. Thus the steam version is actually better in my opinion because it won't make you wonder about that other content that makes little sense with the story. Even if I do think the story purposely makes the reader sad by having the characters purposely choose the more painful route even though there were way better options available I still respect it none the less.\n\nValue\nI would say about $15. To be honest I usually don't value VN games at a high value so this is actually rather up there for me. Especially since I normally say $1 per hour of gameplay. Except this time the story, sound, and slight animations make it worth the extra $0.50 an hour.","September 9, 2015","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

He enters a mysterious facility and meets a girl who has more to her than meets the eye. No, I promise you I have not confused eden* with Planetarian. That said, if you enjoyed Planetarian, then I think you are very likely to enjoy eden*.\n\nThe visuals in eden* are good. In addition to having a variety of poses and facial expressions for each character, the characters are shown to blink and their lips sync with the voice acting. There are many CGs and each one is beautiful to see. Several locations even have multiple CGs and this gives the impression of a changing camera angle. I like it.\n\nAs eden* is a visual novel, the topic of H-scenes should be raised. I did some research and discovered that the H-scenes are apparently bonus content to unlock in the main menu after completing the kinetic novel once. This means that the H-scenes are not at all relevant to developing the canon storyline. So don’t worry about characters suddenly referring to something that happened during a deleted H-scene. That said, I also read that the H-scenes add more depth to each character despite being non-canon. Anyway, it should be well known now that if you want to see H-scenes then you should buy directly from MangaGamer.\n\nThe sound is good. The background music sets the mood well. However, it does not loop well because the end of the music fades to silence before starting again. The voice acting is good. I did not find any characters irritating to listen to. I think the emotions contained in the voice acting were appropriate for each character and the situation.\n\nThe story is told using flashbacks, and it makes some of the plot developments easy to see coming. The setting is easy to follow. The plot is decent and enjoyable, but it is not great. The translation is good. There are a few instances when I think a native English speaker would find the text unnatural but the text is still grammatically correct so it can still be understood.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed eden* and recommend it to people who enjoy visual/kinetic novels. It is not a great kinetic novel, but it is good enough to deserve a place in the visual/kinetic novel library.","September 9, 2015","true","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Truly, anybody.  I should mention, no spoilers in this review.  So newcomers, read to your heart's content!  Veterans, enjoy the ride.  :-)\n\nI never believed myself to be the visual novel type person.  Games where you just read text always seemed boring to me.  I usually play more RPG/Adventure type games where you actually DO things with your characters, not where there is a set, linear outcome.\n\nBut this game truly altered my views on visual novels.\n\nI like to think of my myself as a rather "tough" individual when it comes to watching movies and playing games and not getting genuinely sad or "immersed" with the characters in the story.  Not so with this game.  I can count no less than 3 times when I had tears in my eyes playing this and many many other times when I felt concerned beyond what I can describe for the characters within this game's incredibly well-presented story.\n\nThe story combines science-fiction with romance to create a very interesting situations.  And the use of suspense, oh my God.  The feeling of: "NOOOOOOOO, not now!" or: "That's not good..." will grip you and tear you apart all throughout the story.  It's fantastic.  Truly fantastic and engaging.\n\nThe game's soundtrack is beautiful.  Although at points I have wondered: "Oh boy, that song again?" it does not detract from the game in any way.  Although a few times when it kicked in it scared me, I remedied the issue by turning BGM down just a tad in options.  Then no problems.\n\nI thought the art style was sort of weird at first, but now it is very appealing to me.  I guess it may be my sister's very awkward views on what is anatomically correct, but I promise this game's art is quite incredible and that my sister is full of crap.\n\nIn terms of characters, their development, and how they change over the course of the story, I've never experienced anything quite like this.  Some of the most powerful scenes I've ever seen have come from this game.  I cannot applaud Minori, the creator of this work of art, enough for the beautiful creation I have just witnessed.  This is off the grading scale.\n\nI'd have to invent an entirely new grading scale to accurately rate how good this game is to me.  But I'll spare those details.\n\nI came, expecting it to be a "crappy harem" with a "strange" art-style and only one, "dry" ending.  Plus ew, all that text you have to read and potentially "bad" voice actors/actresses.\n\nI left feeling completely different.  Changed.  Soothed, if you will.  Also, I must say my prior judgements are unfathomly incorrect.  If you have any/all of those like I did, play the game.  You will see what I mean after completing the game.  You will be most surprised.\n\nThe game has an overwhelmingly positive rating, and I am proud to contribute to that.  As my first ever review for a game, I am most satisfied it is with this glorious visual novel.  I played.  I cried.  I left feeling at peace and satisfied with my purchase.  Money well spent.\n\nTLDR:\nRecommended.  :-)  Very highly recommended.  :-) :-) :-)\n\nPS- And don't rush through it, whatever you do (I didn't, although towards the end I was quite anxious to see the ending, although I never skipped anything).  Enjoy it.  And remember, do not suppress your tears.  Or I probably would've cried a ton more, and especially audibly at no less than 3 parts in the game.  Part of enjoying games like these are to truly take in their beauty and let your emotion express itself, as it should be allowed to.","September 5, 2015","true","14.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Humanity would have only 100 years to escape the planet and venture out into the stars.\n\nTo accomplish this monumental task, one scientist genetically engineered genius children. Among these was Sion, the genius among geniuses who would go on to design the ships and engines to make interstellar travel into a reality. And now, as Earth enters its last days and mankind has begun its migration to the heavens, she has but one wish: freedom.\n\nI highly recommend Eden* to those who love romantic visual novels, but mostly to those who have the patience! Not only is the story rather long, but some scenes seem drawn out more than they should be. At the same time, there’s plenty of character development. If you’re someone who wants a story told with little backstory or diversions, this game is not for you. Those who can stick it out, definitely pick this game up! The music should also keep you entranced while reading all the dialogue.\n\n\nThis game was so worth the money and time, you should try it out too ^-^","September 4, 2015","true","12.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Truly, anybody.  I should mention, no spoilers in this review.  So newcomers, read to your heart's content!  Veterans, enjoy the ride.  :-)\n\nI never believed myself to be the visual novel type person.  Games where you just read text always seemed boring to me.  I usually play more RPG/Adventure type games where you actually DO things with your characters, not where there is a set, linear outcome.\n\nBut this game truly altered my views on visual novels.\n\nI like to think of my myself as a rather "tough" individual when it comes to watching movies and playing games and not getting genuinely sad or "immersed" with the characters in the story.  Not so with this game.  I can count no less than 3 times when I had tears in my eyes playing this and many many other times when I felt concerned beyond what I can describe for the characters within this game's incredibly well-presented story.\n\nThe story combines science-fiction with romance to create a very interesting situations.  And the use of suspense, oh my God.  The feeling of: "NOOOOOOOO, not now!" or: "That's not good..." will grip you and tear you apart all throughout the story.  It's fantastic.  Truly fantastic and engaging.\n\nThe game's soundtrack is beautiful.  Although at points I have wondered: "Oh boy, that song again?" it does not detract from the game in any way.  Although a few times when it kicked in it scared me, I remedied the issue by turning BGM down just a tad in options.  Then no problems.\n\nI thought the art style was sort of weird at first, but now it is very appealing to me.  I guess it may be my sister's very awkward views on what is anatomically correct, but I promise this game's art is quite incredible and that my sister is full of crap.\n\nIn terms of characters, their development, and how they change over the course of the story, I've never experienced anything quite like this.  Some of the most powerful scenes I've ever seen have come from this game.  I cannot applaud Minori, the creator of this work of art, enough for the beautiful creation I have just witnessed.  This is off the grading scale.\n\nI'd have to invent an entirely new grading scale to accurately rate how good this game is to me.  But I'll spare those details.\n\nI came, expecting it to be a "crappy harem" with a "strange" art-style and only one, "dry" ending.  Plus ew, all that text you have to read and potentially "bad" voice actors/actresses.\n\nI left feeling completely different.  Changed.  Soothed, if you will.  Also, I must say my prior judgements are unfathomly incorrect.  If you have any/all of those like I did, play the game.  You will see what I mean after completing the game.  You will be most surprised.\n\nThe game has an overwhelmingly positive rating, and I am proud to contribute to that.  As my first ever review for a game, I am most satisfied it is with this glorious visual novel.  I played.  I cried.  I left feeling at peace and satisfied with my purchase.  Money well spent.\n\nTLDR:\nRecommended.  :-)  Very highly recommended.  :-) :-) :-)\n\nPS- And don't rush through it, whatever you do (I didn't, although towards the end I was quite anxious to see the ending, although I never skipped anything).  Enjoy it.  And remember, do not suppress your tears.  Or I probably would've cried a ton more, and especially audibly at no less than 3 parts in the game.

Thats just becuse i'm a bit of a pervert and decided i'd rather read the 18+ version, which btw changes the story in no way. It just adds some extra bonus 'alternate' scenes if you know what I mean. ;)\n\nFirst things first this is a kinetic novel, in other words there are NO choices, and therefore only one ending. The closest parallel I can draw from the steam library is Planetatian, which btw is another great kinetic novel, if a bit shorter.\n\nThe story in this one is for the most part pretty predictable, in so much as you know what the ending is going to be basically from the get go. This is not actually a problem though as for this visual novel, it is the journey, not the destination that you will enjoy. The plot is vaguely similar to the anime plastic memories if you have seen it, and if you have then you will know to prepare for some hardcore emotions throughout, so make sure to pack some tissues.\n\nI liked all of the characters and enjoyed their interactions with each other, although the main character was perhaps a bit unlikable at the start but by the end he had really grown on me.\n\nThe animation and CG design was really top notch, the artwork is one of the best i've seen visual novel wise. The soundtrack was good as well, really fitting the mood for the most part.\n\nTo sum up, this is an amazing visual novel and is well worth your time to read it. Having said that, this is my first real review so It may be a bit shoddily written but I hope I have articulated how good this is.\n\nPersonally I would suggest getting it on mangagamer though, I believe you get a free steam copy anyway, as that version contains bonus scenes that require just as many tissues as the main story, though for a bit of a different reason.

It matches with the mood quite well and is never irritating.\n\n11/10 Visuals: A kinetic novel always needs less work, however, the opening and the animated visuals with multi CGs are still fantastic. The amount of CGs make me forget that they're even considered CGs because it feels like it blends in with the story so well along with its frequency. Their mouths move and they blink in every single scene. That is absolutely amazing effort. The opening looks like an anime. The art is so beautiful and impressive.\n\n10/10 Atmosphere: The writing style, audio and visuals were put together to create such an amazing atmosphere. It may be just a kinetic novel, but the way this visual novel was made creates such an amazing atmosphere.

This adds to the feeling of the reader to emphasize with those who stayed in the mansion for so long.\n\n9/10 Plot: Almost a masterpiece! The plot is quite sensical, however only a few small things were never explained. The small things unexplained were not the main point of the plot, so know not to worry. A majority of the plot was explained. The plot is quite sensible and consistent. When I expected the plot to end, it wasn't even close to the end, in fact they covered a majority of plot holes. The plot went about excitingly or gently, never rushed.\n\n\n9/10 Characters: The character development was magnificent and each character has more to them than just their looks. Every character shows their stupidity and smarts in different subjects. Their intelligence is also consistent, as well as their personality. Every small thing said shows each character's personality. Each character has a voice actor. They all have clear and voices that match the tone of the scene. Their emotions are easily felt with each character's feelings. By the end, every single character has their endings explained.\n\n9.5/10 Overall: Needless to say, amazing work.","November 30, 2015","true","21.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are chlichés like oversized breasts, a cute army girl and a cute housemaiden. Part of me was afraid a cute magical cat-girl would appear next but thankfully I was spared this. Luckily the protagonist is not some silly perverted fool tripping into his own personal harem he has secretly dreamed for but a rather cold-hearted war veteran, and there are a couple other characters of that sort that you wouldn't necessarily expect in your more ordinary anime.\n\nDespite some initial bumps and doubts the game is rather profound and thoughtful and has a better world and story to tell than most other KNs/VNs I have played. Their unoriginal exterior and cliché-like introductions aside the characters were likeable and quite well written and had more depth than meets the eye. The game features a pretty interesting pre-apocalyptic sci-fi scenario that has you experience the final phases of mankind fleeing earth due to a bright red star that appeared in the sky and is said to destroy it. It's featuring some genuine sci-fi elements but isn't dwelling on the technical terms of it as much, it's more about the people and how they handle it all.

Thanks to them I put my initial doubts aside and it didn't took me long before I liked it, wanted to see how the story works out, had it touch parts of my heart in several ways and realized that this game is one of the better, higher-value kinetic novels to be found.

Not only is the plot lengthy but it manages to keep you intrigued and makes you hold on to the very end. The sound track also supplements the game nicely and doesn't get boring due to its variety. I've read that people refer to Clannad (anime, google it if not sure) when speaking about this and it really does have that feel to it, although I won't ruin any plot. Sometimes when playing through VNs, some parts may feel long and stretched out which can lead to long boring patches, but I didn't find this once in Eden* which places it up there with my most favourite VNs.\n9/10 maya best grill","August 8, 2015","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I personally would have liked that they would have spent more time in the first half to expand some of the minor characters a bit more.\n\nThe art is pretty good and there are quite a few good landscape shots.

No real choices to make during the game, so won't get that kind of gameplay out of it.\n\nBut I can say it was very much worth getting. For a summary that talks about the planet's final love story, it certainly delivers on that front. You know how it is going to end, but it takes nothing away from the power of the story. It's one of those times when you know how things will turn out and it's all the more impactful because of it. Finding out how things ended up like this and the journey the main characters went through.\n\nIn terms of story and characters Eden* just delievers. I also appreciated the strong art and visuals. It is just japanese voices and english subtitles, but the voice acting is top notch. A nice touch as well that you do get to see lips moving as the characters talk so it really does feel like you are watching this story from up close. I don't think the story would have been as good if the MC wasn't as complete a character as the rest of the cast and you had dialogue options popping up. Everything just worked for the sake of the story.\n\nTook me about 12 hours to get through it. Might take others a bit less time, but if you are letting all the characters speak their voiced lines then it will take a good while. Definitely worth what I paid for such a strong story. And got to me enough that I wanted to write up something about it.\n\nIt is a story that will leave a bittersweet feeling behind, but if that doesn't bother people then I wholly recommend it.","March 8","true","12.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No real choices to make during the game, so won't get that kind of gameplay out of it.\n\nBut I can say it was very much worth getting. For a summary that talks about the planet's final love story, it certainly delivers on that front. You know how it is going to end, but it takes nothing away from the power of the story. It's one of those times when you know how things will turn out and it's all the more impactful because of it. Finding out how things ended up like this and the journey the main characters went through.\n\nIn terms of story and characters Eden* just delievers. I also appreciated the strong art and visuals. It is just japanese voices and english subtitles, but the voice acting is top notch. A nice touch as well that you do get to see lips moving as the characters talk so it really does feel like you are watching this story from up close. I don't think the story would have been as good if the MC wasn't as complete a character as the rest of the cast and you had dialogue options popping up. Everything just worked for the sake of the story.\n\nTook me about 12 hours to get through it. Might take others a bit less time, but if you are letting all the characters speak their voiced lines then it will take a good while. Definitely worth what I paid for such a strong story. And got to me enough that I wanted to write up something about it.\n\nIt is a story that will leave a bittersweet feeling behind, but if that doesn't bother people then I wholly recommend it.","March 8","true","12.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But overall, I enjoyed it. The art is good, the music is good, the story's not too long, the characters, while maybe a bit mary sue-ish, feel real enough to keep me engaged in their interactions, and the ambiguous nature of the main plot is probably for the best; doesn't really need to be an exact answer for everything. The romantic aspects are generally sidelined and only come into play near the end (maybe why the ending felt like a slog for me) but there's enough of a buildup and character development that it's not really bothersome. Do note that this is a VN with no choices whatsoever, literally just a visual novel that you read/look at/listen to etc. But it works fine for the story. So yeah. Mildly pleasant overall, doesn't really feel like it drags on much, and there's plenty of heart to it.\n\nThe heck is up with the intro though, doesn't really fit in with the tone of the game at all.","June 2","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
