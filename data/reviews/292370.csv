This game has less depth and refinement than many FREE community projects, from the official RPG Maker Forums.\n\nPlease understand, I am not normally this brutal with my RMVXA reviews and I genuinely TRIED to give this game a good run with around 2 hours of my life (I want back), but this game reeks of a want-a-be artist that couldn't get hired to make a real game so they tried to make their own, and did so...\n\nBADLY.\n\nAnd WTF is with obscuring half the battle scene with actor busts during skill selection?!? *BOGGLE*\n(No those screen shots are NOT battle conversation artwork, but appear EVERY SINGLE BATTLE)\n\nIf I could, I'd ask for a refund.\n\nI truly feel sorry for anyone that paid the MSRP, as I feel cheated having bought it at a deep discount.\n\nFor the record, I apologize for my tone.

I happen to like the RPG Maker genre.\n\nDarkEnd is among the very best RPG Maker games that I have played.\nI spend more than 100+ hours playing this game, and enjoyed it tremendously, and that is why I decide to write a review of DarkEnd to share my experiences.\n\nIn DarkEnd you can play as one of 4 different Primary Characters, and each of these 4 character has a very unique and intriguing storyline. You can also select a Secondary Character from the remaining 3 characters. The storyline is quite complex and convoluted and you normally would not know who is good or bad until the very end. Each of the character has their own unique reasons to go into the DarkEnd, and the outcome is also different and unique. Playing this game is like reading a detective novel for me, and each stage of the game give me a better glimpse of the story.\n\nThere is also a lot of replayability because when you finished the game, you can play NG+ and select a different starting character. All the items and gold get carried forward to the next game, but all the quests resets. I like this system very much. There are also lots of optional side quests, and optional dungeons that spawn randomly too.\n\nOn the negative side, there are some minor gramatical and syntactic errors. However, I personally not mind these errors, and did overlook them because I like the stories, the plot twists and the interesting game play.\n\nI had a good time playing DarkEnd and for me, its worth the money spent. I love this game and would highly recommend it.","October 1, 2015","true","116.9"," 28 of 33 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","28","33","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chanmyaephyo/recommended/292370/","chanmyaephyo","CHAN MYAE","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chanmyaephyo/","3 products in account","If you are expecting an epic RPG where a young hero braved an adventure along with colorful people to vanquish evil, you are looking at the wrong place because, in DarkEnd, you will find no such thing.\n\n-Story-\nThe core story is very simple. Once, there was a king, who led mankind to prosperity with his magical talents. However, he wished for more power, the power to rival gods, and after messing around with “Primordial Darkness”, the element of creation, he was driven mad and unleashed the destruction upon the land; the DarkEnd. A hero stood up and destroyed the Magus King and stopped the DarkEnd. However, the same mistake was repeated once again due to mankind’s nature. You are one of the four chosen heroes to stop the DarkEnd, once and for all.\n\nAlthough the core story is simple, the game becomes very interesting due to the fact the game uses minimalistic story-telling to reveal the backstory of heroes.  You can choose a main protagonist and a supportive character out of four given heroes. Each hero has his/her own reason to stop the DarkEnd and the game reveals them with relatively smooth pacing.\n\nThe character development was quite unexpected as the band of heroes seemed very stereotypical at first. However, they evolved very quickly as the game progressed. There is a distinct personality for each hero and their unique dialogues help this.\n-Gameplay-\nThe gameplay is the meat and bone of this game. Like many dungeon crawlers, this game’s primary gameplay is pretty straightforward. You have to go inside the DarkEnd, floor by floor until you reach the end. There is a town which serves as the “main base” where you can heal, restock items, and buy/sell equips.\nThe battles are unforgiving and very exciting. I’m currently playing with Valiant difficulty (Developer’s recommendation) and I have to say this is probably one of the most challenging RPGs I’ve ever played.  Even a typical battle with normal mob can make you break cold sweat.  Challenge a rare monster or optional boss without preparing and you’ll get the “gameover” screen in your face very quickly. The difficulty, however, is never unfair.  With enough preparation and reasonable strategy, every battle can be won. There is no need to go grind and overpower your characters.\nThe game’s skill tree called “Corridor of Origin” is very unique. In the base town, you can go to a alternative realm called Corridor of Origin, where you can light up the crystals (akin to Sphere Grid in FFX) to earn various skills. Each character has a unique Corridor which allows you to set up multiple combinations of skills for your main and supportive heroes.\nThe best feature of this game is randomly changing dungeons.  There are massive amount of sidequests, sub-dungeons and enemies, which changes every time you reenter the dungeon.  Replay value is very high since you have 4 heroes with unique story line for each and randomly changing dungeon.\n\n-Graphic and Sound-\nThe pixel art in the game is very pretty. The game is mostly gloomy and dark, but some of the scenes are simply pretty for a 2D sprite-based game. The character portraits are also very beautiful. Although the cut-scene graphic may be a bit choppy, I have no problem with them. In fact, they reminded me of cut-scenes from old Genesis RPG; Phantasy Star.\n\nThe music is no less thrilling. The game made use of wild range of captive music from cool, calming ones to upbeat and exciting ones. The battle themes are very catchy and memorable. I found myself humming battle tunes after a few hours.\n-Conclusion-\nStory - 8.0/10\nGameplay- 9.0/10\nGraphic&SFX – 7/10\nReplay Value – 10/10\n\nOverall – 8/10\n\nDarkEnd, in my opinion, is a nice throwback to olden day’s gameplay-driven RPGs. The game gives me the distinct atmosphere of games such as Etrian Odyssey, Diablo 1 and Dark Souls. So if you are a fan of such kind of RPGs, DarkEnd is worth a try.\n","November 8, 2014","true","2.1"," 28 of 38 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","28","38","0","0"

The side quests were hard to do due to the low drop chances (or my horrible luck) and the random generating was so random i found the fairy 10 times and the cave once before giving up.\n\nI'll give the story a 6 out of ten, but i played as griselda and was confused until I hit the end of the dark dimension. I like some curious plot twists but I got a little lost there. In the description even it said something about a love story. I didn't see it at all besides the weird flash backs about someone who wasn't even my MC.\n\nFor 4 bucks if your bored enough to waste 7 some odd hours like I did, I recommend it (Kinda). But for something to play over again to see it through the other characters stories? Nope.","May 19, 2015","false","7.1"," 20 of 29 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","20","29","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/portal0072/recommended/292370/","portal0072","§ôµL","http://steamcommunity.com/id/portal0072/","16 products in account","I’ve played and beaten the non-steam version of this game a while ago. Overall a solid RPG. Recommend it for people who like to enjoy the challenging turnbased RPGs.\n\nDarkEnd is somewhat similar to the instant-classic Etarian Odyssey series. Light on story but rather focused on gameplay. The battles are really harsh for unprepared party and could get wiped easily by simple blunder.\n\nWhat I really like about this game is the boss battles. Most RPG maker RPGs I have played have rather simple boss battles. The bosses are only just stronger. All you need to do is use your strongest skills and heal when it is needed. It is not so simple in DarkEnd. Each and every boss, except the first one, has a catch and require special tactic to beat them. Since every spell and skill have cooldown and warm up timer, you have to think carefully which skill to be used at which moment. Spamming the strongest spell/skill without any strategy will only get yourself killed in DarkEnd.\nOptional bosses are also very challenging. Since you cannot save in the dungeon, it can be a really tensed situation when you try to challenge a rare optional boss in the randomly appeared sub-level.  I wish the developers should give the game some achievements to make challenging boss battles even more worthwhile.\n\nThe story is nothing revolutionary. There are some interesting plot twists and lore which will be revealed late in game, but the story itself is pretty simple. The characters are well developed, especially Griselda and Lucion. However, the localization is a real let down in this game. Even as a second language user myself, I found some dialogues in game very cheesy and ridden with awkward grammar.\n\nGraphically, the game exactly of what you can expect of RPG maker games out there. I noticed the game used the stocked RTP materials mixed with some custom work. The pixel sprites are neat and colorful and some scenes in game are simple beautiful.  The characters’ portrait arts are nice too.\n\nVerdict : Have you ever played any of Etarian Series?  Do you like them? Do you like very challenging RPG? If your answer is a “Yes”, buy this (at least at the discount period) and you will enjoy this difficult but very rewarding RPG experience. A solid 7/10 game.\n","February 11, 2015","true","1.2"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

The world creation and levels are decently thought out.  It plays well with a controller, my case a Logitech RumblePad.  It has a very old school quest hub system that harkens back to pen and paper D&D.  I loved its use of lighting.  It created a rather unusual fog of war which normally isn't seen in RPGs today.\n\nThere were two serious drawbacks that keep it from being a great game.  First, it is grindy, even on Casual level.  After a while it, I felt bored playing it.  It was fight after, fight after, fight with very little story telling. It needed more story to break the monotony of battle.\n\nThe biggest drawback is questing.  After unlocking all the overland characters, you find one NPC that spams crafting missions.  It totally ruins the experience of completing the side/major quests.  Should have split them into at least two groups.  The other aspect is its randomness prevents completion of some quests as they don't trigger during exploration.  This forces the player to redo previously beat content where you are often so over-powered that it drags.\n\nIf you like grindy RPGs, this is at least worth a look for at most a $5 spot.","April 20, 2015","true","5.5"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

The game follows the journey of a main character and a secondary character which are both selected at the start of the game from a choice of 4, the game offers a variety of difficulty levels to suit all players from those just interested in the story so do not wish for a hard game, those looking for the usual RPG experience and those in search of a game that will drive you insane with how hard it is. The game takes place after a great and powerful man lusted for power to rival even the Gods, he found power but unleashed the DarkEnd, the man was defeated but as time passes man forgets and the darkness now returns, choose your hero and fight the darkness. You journey to the frontier to fight the DarkEnd, to progress through the DarkEnd you must complete individual floors and leave through the portal but in order to use the portal you need a key, the keys can be found in chests or dropped from enemies and the floor boss, through each level you will encounter enemies and rare enemies. As expected the rarer enemies are well rarer and will put up more of a fight and give you more exp as a reward for killing them. You should not underestimate rare enemies they can be deadly and in the event your party dies you will have a game over and have to start from the last time you saved and that is only at the frontier, don’t lose all your progress out of pride. Do not fear you do not have to do the whole game in 1 run there are serpent gates which act as a checkpoint once activated you can then travel back to the point you left from the frontier after resupplying of course. The levels you progress through may change if you die and start them again they can change in that they have a boss rather than a chest or they can change all together. The game features several very catchy songs as all good RPG’s should. Each character can act each turn at the beginning you are given the option to fight or flee, each character can attack, defend, use magic or use a special the magic attacks use mp and the special attacks use Ep which is generated by attacking and getting hit, not all characters have a special to start with, magic and other abilities can be unlocked using the upgrade system which involves choosing to kindle various crystals. Each floor will differ if you have to repeat it such as loot and if a key spawns in a chest or you have to fight the boss for it, when you characters health is low you can use a potion or a heal spell. All spells and specials have a cool down so be sure to time their uses correctly and choose the right target an enemy with a fire weakness might well die in 1 hit to a fireball and an enemy with a fire resistance almost certainly will not. Spells initially have a warm up period as well meaning at the start you ca’t cast a fireball and destroy the enemy turn 1 but as you upgrade your spells the warm up will no longer be required.\n\nDying in DarkEnd can be very frustrating especially if you are having a good run maybe you found some good loot and then you got cocky and a rare enemy destroyed you, but if you didn’t want a challenge you should have chosen a lower difficulty. Dying and retrying is how you learn anyway, although it can be sad to lose a good run it just encourages you to try again and not make the same mistakes.\n\nThe combat of the game can be very strategic with you having to time your magic and special attacks to when they are best used for example an attack that provides a stun effect might keep you alive long enough to use a magic that was on cool down next turn.\n\nThe DarkEnd is split into floors of 5 on the 5th floor you will encounter a boss and also get some story, after the set of 5 floors you will then enter a new area with new music, new enemies(far harder) etc.\n\nThe art style of the game is just lovely with the majority of the game having the usual 2D RPG look but during tutorials and cut scenes the looks of the characters truly show the time taken to create.\n\nOverall from playing DarkEnd I highly recommend it to any 2D RPG fans it has a beautiful look, charming characters, good combat and a catchy soundtrack what more do you need?\n\nThe only negative is the game has a small resolution meaning if you are a graphics snob this probably isn’t for you.\n\nI rate this game highly and would give it an 8/10 for a small indie game it is excellent and is currently in my top 10 games of the year.","October 21, 2014","true","3.3"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","11","21","0","1"
