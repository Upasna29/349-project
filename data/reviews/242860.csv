The trench warfare turn based attack gameplay is insane, as you see first hand the horrors of the First World War, which, by the way, is now 100 years past.\n\nI bought this game in eraly access and was satisfied with it.  Now I can't get enough of it!\n\nI have been fed up with large companies coming out with garbage and selling DLC every five minutes.  Verdun's updates and new squards are being released free of charge over the next while, so this game will become even better and more varied than it is now.\n\nVerdun is one of a special kind of game, one that requires teamwork to dominate the map.  While battlefield has become zany and unrealistic, Verdun forces you to play as a team, and unlike in battlefield, if you fail to do so, you will die again, and again, and again.\n\nI cannot recommend this game more to anyone.  The learning curb is massive, but you have so many classes to play as that are open to even the newest players.\n\nHonestly there is something satisfying about having to use bolt action rifles in a trench that is captivating in and of itself.  It is insanly addicitive and the squad based gameplay is incredible.\n\nVerdun is by far the best FPS I have ever played as I have put in so many hours of my life into it (roughly 10 hours alone in hte last few weeks).\n\nI cannot recommend this game any more.\n\nSO GO BUY IT.\n\nAnd as for some advice, keep your head down.\nThis isn't Call of Duty.","May 1, 2015","true","70.3"," 2,074 of 2,241 people (93%) found this review helpful 708 people found this review funny","93","074","2","708","60"

We all signed for this, some of them added a year to their age to go here, to reach this hell. The bomb struck few meters away from me. Tinnitus in my left air. All I can hear is buzzing noise that drives me nuts. Our attack didn't succeed. Now we're defending this point desperately and I can hear enemy... I can FEEL enemy getting closer.\n\nToo afraid to raise my head, to afraid to take a look. I keep my head low. It might save my life. I've seen it before. Head goes above the sandbag line... Splattered brain showers the muddy trench. I can't move. My NCO told me to stay here. Moving away, progressing or backing up would mean I'm a deserter. And we all knew what happens to those poor souls.\n\nI see a sizzling bomb dropping a few meters away and suddenly, the trench is filled with thick green smoke. Mustard. Senfgas, as Germans call it. I feel like a trapped mouse. Panic takes control over my body. My hands are struggling to protect my face with a gas mask. I... I did it. I've started running away mindlessly from the deafening noise of shots.\n\nI feel the enemy getting clos...\n\nBayonet strikes my chest and pierces skin, muscles and bones. The pointy, rusty blade exits through my back. I taste blood on my tongue. Thundering noise in my head, I raise it to see the eyes of my killer. He has the same eyes, just like me, hidden behind the gas mask, just like mine. He... he's me, the same frightened boy who will think of his mother the way I'm thinking about mine right now... maybe a bit later. Maybe tomorrow. Who knows... He's just been a bit more lucky than me at this moment. I can sense his misery and fear while he pulls the steel out and pushes me away. As I fall down, I see him going away. Leaving my body to be swallowed by everlasting darkness...\n\nThis is Verdun.\n\n---\n\nIf you like this review, feel free to join me for some more recommendations at http://steamcommunity.com/groups/libereviews","May 11, 2015","true","6.5"," 1,154 of 1,266 people (91%) found this review helpful 212 people found this review funny","91","154","1","212","62"

A truly one-of-a-kind experience that blends the familiarity of standard FPS games, and the uniqueness of the World War One era. This is the only game that you will find for this time period and genre of game, and for there to be only one choice, Verdun fills the niche perfectly. The developers are active on the forums and after every major patch I can see implementations of things that were mentioned in the forums. As well as amazing devs, the gameplay is very immersive. Although I can only play on low graphics, the immersion in the game while running up to take a trench is mind-boggling. This game does what no other company has tried to do and has pushed the boundaries of what, by many, was thought to be an impossible idea. Most people assumed that a World War One game would be boring and have no playerbase. They were wrong. Kudos to Matt, Mike, Leo, and the rest of the squad for making a dream game come true.","June 16, 2015","true","504.9"," 437 of 463 people (94%) found this review helpful 33 people found this review funny","94","437","463","33","8"

Why? let's see:\n\nIt's WW1 reallistic, so:\n1.-One bullet, you're dead.\n2.-You're going to die a lot.\n\nThere's no other way to play, so if you think it's all about getting frags and firing alot, stay away (your semi rifle has 5 bullets). This is totally like the Great War, you are just another soldier between millions and you have to run to the trench crossing no mans land, that's like 70% chances to get shot, fall into artillery fire, or taste the barbwire. If you reach the trench, alone will do nothing, can kill some but you need your team to capture it. If you can conquer it, congratulations, hold it because the enemy is counter-attacking. If you fail, get back to your trench, it's time to defend against the enemy...\n\nAlso, usually you don't know who or what killed you or how... so you need to relax and be patience on this game.\n\nThat means all the kids, trolls, frenetic players and mainly all kind of online players you usually hate will leave soon, and only fine players willing to play properly will stay... and this is such a HUGE reward!!!\n\nIf you are one of them, you'll find many good times playing in squads, with old fashioned weapons in the WW1 warfare and it's own strategy, you'll find very find people in Verdun.\n\nBad things? Servers aren't as good as a major company, so you'll get lag many times, the technology and graphics are OK, the needed to play, and still there's some bugs...\n\nBUT, if you like reallistic games, historic warfare, and the long-forgotten sensation to play just for fun and really getting it from being part of a well made assault and get your objective in team play... welcome to the community of Verdun.\n","July 16, 2015","true","37.2"," 530 of 572 people (93%) found this review helpful 45 people found this review funny","93","530","572","45","15"

A word that encapsulates the horrors of the First World War. For it was at Verdun where the belligerents to the fighting had to endure some of the most appalling living and fighting conditions during the course of the war on the Western Front. The incessant shelling had turned the once pristine land into a wasteland. The constant disturbance of the clay at Verdun and the driving rain caused the formation of deep craters filled with oozing liquid that could drown men if they were so unfortunate as to fall into the hell hole. The battle was so ferocious a man is said to have been killed every minute of every day for 9 months. A death toll of some 800,000 men. One infantry man wrote 'If you have not seen Verdun, you haven't seen anything of war'.\n\nVerdun the Game\n\nVerdun is not primarily focused on the 9-month battle of Verdun of 1916, but rather encompasses 6 intensively researched maps, each portraying a different sector along the Western front, in which the Entente and Central Powers fought so ferociously over between 1914-1918.\n\nWhy Verdun Succeeds\n\nI don't think it is premature to state that the developers of Verdun, have made a tour de force in the form of Verdun. It is rare to find a game, that catapults you into an era in history with such an eye for detail, that you'll find yourself swearing that you are there. The immersion level in Verdun is what has kept me coming back to Verdun time and time again (286 hours on record).\n\nVisuals\n\nThe game runs on Unity 5, perhaps the most popular Graphics engine currently around. Having had the game for 10 months or so, I have witnessed the transformation of Verdun's art direction first hand. It is only in the past 6 months, where the visuals have elevated the production values of the game to stratospheric heights. Notable visual details include:\n\n-On ultra, the deformation of No Man’s Land is a feast for the eyes. However, even on low the game looks good.\n-The character models have been researched to a very high degree, with excellent texturing.\n-Artillery shells impact the ground as you would expect. Showering men with debris and sending intense plumes of smoke high into the air.\n- Water logged craters, reflect the environment and character models.\n-Those trees not victim to shelling, look accurate.\n- The mud, especially on the map 'Artois' and 'Flanders' look photo-realistic.\n-Gas obscures your vision as it should, and the way it slowly creeps through the trench systems is impressive looking.\n\nAmbient Sounds\n\nFrom the whistling of bullets over your head, to the dull thud of shells in the distance, Verdun shines in depicting the sounds of the Great War. Rifles from the Entente and Central Powers make distinctive 'cracks', whilst the man suffocating from a gas attack near you, gasps in desperation. Other ambient highlights include:\n\n-Voice commands by fellow players which can be entered using the X key. There are over 20 instructions/emotions you can use. The most commonly used is 'Take Cover' and 'Retreat'!\n- Mud squelches beneath your feet, when running in poorly irrigated battlefields such as Flanders.\n-Officers (NCO's) can use their whistle to direct where their squad should position themselves.\n-Reconnaissance aircraft can be heard (and seen) meandering their way above the frontlines.\n\nSquad progression\n\nProgression in Verdun is unlike anything you’ve seen before in an FPS. Verdun relies heavily on the use of squads. A squad comprises of 4 men each and there are 4 squads in each team. Each squad brings a unique role, uniform and weaponry to the battlefield. If you are in a match with certain players often and they are in your squad, the game will automatically track and save your progress (xp) with those people. Overtime, building enough experience with these players will elevate your squad rank which in turn unlocks a plethora of new abilities. These new abilities include the use of mustard gas and artillery barrages!\n\nPersonal progression\n\nVerdun of course also tracks your own personal growth within the game. There are over 40+ unique roles to unlock during the course of the game. Reaching the rank of level 100 is a bruising yet satisfying experience.\n\nBattle Modes\n\nThere are battle modes in Verdun. Frontlines and Deathmatch.\n\n\nFrontline mode\n\nThis mode tries to depict and simulate the mainly futile efforts of soldiers to try and take trenches on the Western front during WW1. It is almost flawless in design. A frontlines battle usually lasts 25- 45 minutes depending upon which map you’re playing on. When a game begins you’re either authorised by the game to ‘attack’ or ‘defend’. Once the initial attack timer is over (usually 5 minutes long) and provided the enemy have not achieved a foothold (whereby extra time is afforded to the attackers if they are able to place men in the enemy trench before and after the initial attack timer has needed) then it is tasked with the defenders to attack. This counter-attack and defend system really forces squad collaboration. It is imperative that squads cover the entire length of a trench system, if they are to avoid being overrun and their trench taken. However, once the first line of a trench is taken the defeated team ‘fall back’ to their prepared 2nd defensive trench line. Thus, even if you lose a trench, you can always take it back.  There can be as many as 3 trench lines on a map. Some 32 players (16 vs 16) can fight it out in total on any map.\n\nDeath Match Mode\n\nThis is by far the least popular of the 2 battle modes. This mode sees you enter into a rifle death match to kill as many players as possible. There are no teams in this one, which forces players to rely on their marksman skills. The maps in this mode, whilst identical to those of Frontline mode, are far smaller.\n\nOptimisation\n\nThe level of optimisation for PC and Laptops has improved vastly during Early Access. The developers have spent a considerable time optimising the game. It now runs at almost 60fps on ultra for me, where before it would run at a mere 12fps.\n\nFuture content\n\nWhilst Verdun is being released tomorrow (27/04/2015), the developers have expressed their desire to keep supporting the game post-release. They have hinted at possible new squads such as the Americans and the German pioneer squads. New maps have already been made and shall soon be ‘updated’ in the game. A developer has personally hinted to me that there will be a hard core mode in the near future, which will focus on even greater depth of immersion.\n\nFinal word\n\nVerdun caters towards an audience who appreciates a squad-based World War experience . From the person who wants that feeling of cooperation with their teammates to the player who wishes to be immersed in a WW1 FPS, you can’t go amiss with this title. The visual fidelity is impressive and when accompanied with the ambient sounds, Verdun surpasses most FPS shooters based in war time. The Frontlines mode whilst simply executed is genius. Never before has defence or counter-attack been as exhilarating as this. As a young man, who lost both his great great uncles to the First World War on the Western Front, Verdun for me bears testament to the sacrifices made by all the men, from every nation involved in the ‘war to end all wars’. M2H and Blackmill Games have brought WW1 to life, like never before and for that I am eternally grateful.\n\nI score the game 9.7 out of 10. My only criticism is that I don't ever play the deathmatch mode.\n\nThanks for reading this.\n\nNote: Since this review the developers have confirmed in their 'Road map' for Verdun that many more squads, maps and realism modes will be included to the game in the coming months. A new gore system is to be added, complete with shredded limbs. The 'Road map' demonstrates the developers true loyalty to their fan base.","April 27, 2015","true","700.2"," 388 of 409 people (95%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","95","388","409","22","4"

It gives me the same tingles as COD (the first one) and Mohaa. It insists you play as a team, otherwise you quickly become alone, exposed and as a team, fragmented and ineffectual. It is a superb game in many ways, but most importantly having played it since it's Alpha phase inception, it does one major thing right - it does not allow spammers, sprayers or any selfish people to win simply by fluke. It tells you a proper story about trench warfare; you fight together or die alone. The graphics are now great, the immersion is fantastic. Deaths are brutally quick and soul-crushingly quiet on occasion; one minute your pal is there, the next he is in a shell hole face down in the mud. Alternatively the crack of a sniper bullet suddenly halts your next step, or a shell explodes and all that is left of you is pink mist. This game brings the trenches to your computer and genuinely tries to demostrate that war is not glorious. It is sad, poignant and utterly maddening. You will care about your life. You will care about others' lives. You will hate dying and you will die over and over again. Practice hard, play hard, and you will be the one whislting "come death come" as you silently end life.","April 28, 2015","true","142.4"," 161 of 168 people (96%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","96","161","168","13","4"

Well I have to say, based on those factors and the gameplay itself, I am very impressed!\n\nThe maps are designed in a way that would either mean the player has to resort to trench warfare, long distance warfare or even a mixture of both, getting the player to adapt to their surroundings and making them become more tactical in their decisions and how they would approah the enemy, which is an excellent feature! The maps also contain a lot of hidden elemnts and restricitons that relate to the kinds of conditions of WW1 (e.g. barbed wire hazards and execution for desertion), which make the game very knowledgable to its historical context as well as adding challenge for players.\n\nThe weapons are also historically accurate as they should be and although there is not much variety in weapon types (5-7 rifles, 1 pistol type each team, 1 MG type each team), there is definitely a sense of competitivity through its ranking systems for weapons, classes and overall all personel rank. This makes the game a hell of a lot more addicting and can make players determined to reach target ranks to unlock more classes for frontline gameplay and unlocks for more rifles in deathmatch gameplay. Although most weapon damage is quite powerful since most rifles tend to kill either instantly or sometimes after 2 shots (depedning on player distance from target), they do allow the player to experiment with different fighting tactics in which pistol classes can be used in trench combat and MGs for defensive purposes as examples.\n\nSquad systems are also a good element which gets the player to think greatly about his fellow team members rather than his own killstreaks. Squad ranking is used in each game and the more experience points recieved together as a group, the more bonus perks can be used to give them greater advantages in frontline combat. There are also a set of 4 classes in the squadron which each have different roles and weapons like the commander, who can give movement orders, mortar strikes andrecon planes but is only equiped with a pistol and binoculars. These types of loadouts in squads allow the player to think more about their class role and how they assist their team members in different situations\n\nAll these features do make quite an interesting game on it's own, however it is an early access game and it of course will have its flaws. Aside animation errors and sudden lags during or other glitches during gameplay, the game itself does not offer you much choice as to what game modes you can play or how you can play. A the moment, there are only 2 game modes, both of which require many people to just run around and shoot people. That's more or less it. Even objectives in Frontlines is obtained through killing players, it doesnt allow player much to do and can easily become quite a boring process for most. If it were to add more game modes with extra objective features that require players to for example arm bombs, use artillery equipement or maybe even use chlorine gas artilery to get players to use gas masks or avoid certain areas of the battlefield. It could do with graphic improvement and model improvements to, but like I said, it is an early access. As far as I'm aware, apparently a free download of the game can be aquired legally on the internet somewhere, which leaves reason to suggest why they would con people to pay money for a free access beta.\n\nAll things aside, this game has definitely been through a thoughtful and well put development process and is generally a great war based game. We could do with more WW1 games, and this seems to pull of it's aspects brilliantly.\n\n[EDIT: Just note that this review was written before the game's more recent major updates. Things like graphics and other features are being improved even more and the game looks more smashing every time there's a new update. Also, I doubt it was influenced by me but I made a suggestion in this review to add a gas bomb feature based on the realities of WW1 and I couldn't believe it when they actually implemented a feature like that! All said and done from this review, it constantly improves and it begins to feel more and more like a true WW1 game!]","June 16, 2014","true","73.2"," 255 of 288 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","255","288","0","8"

TL;DR - an engaging, WWI trench warfare, attack and defend style FPS game. From my own research it's pretty historically accurate too, regarding uniforms and weaponry, and the different nations' units that fought in the European theatre.\n- - -\nNot every FPS-er is going to throw down their Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare or CS:GO for the chance to go "over the top" with low rate of fire hundred year old Lewis machine guns or bolt action Enfield rifles, but if you're a military history buff like me who likes the occasional FPS romp (but, honestly, are sick of all the WWII games) then switching gears to The Great War is a refreshing change. Expect to spawn in, go over the top to attack, and immediately get K98'd in the face a few times. It's unforgiving like that. But then in the same match you might lead an attack on the enemy trench and clear the whole thing, racking up kills and feeling "some type of way."\nVerdun tries to emphasize squad-based tactics and operating with your squadmates by granting you perks for staying within your CO's command aura, and xp bonuses for fighting alongside your squad. There are 4 positions in each squad, always a CO, usually a rifleman, a machine gunner, and a fourth specialty class like grenadier or sniper. Not every squad's job classes are cookie cutter versions of the same thing just renamed, there is enough variance in all the different loadouts (you get better weapons for the different classes with xp/leveling, as in CoD) that most players should find something they like.  I quickly found I don't like the French squad much - their weapons are great, jobs are pretty well balanced but those damn bright blue uniforms stand out! I usually play the Tommies, British infantry, as a Lewis gunner. It's heavy, wildy innacurate when not deployed on its bipod, recruit-level slow reloads, but when I catch the enemy on the offensive and I'm prone with the bipod deployed I can cut down several squads' advances if they aren't covered properly.\nThere's so much more I could ramble on about, but I think I'm just gonna boot the game up now! Check out some gameplay videos if you're on the fence about buying this. I also have a growing collection of screenshots "for ze lulz" you can glance at. I highly recommend.","December 2, 2014","true","24.5"," 157 of 164 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","157","164","0","7"

You play on servers with up to 24 people, in squads of 4. These squads serve different purposes and have different traits. You pick what you want to play as and have at it.

From the ambient WW1-era music in the main menus to the sprawling trench-lines on the battlefields to even individual soldiers' uniforms this game is truly the product of a dedicated team.\n\nThe core game mode of Verdun entails capturing and holding trenches of course. The Entente and Central Powers take turns attacking and defending until time runs out or one side captures every line. Many other games have a similar "capture and hold this area" gameplay mechanic but Verdun takes a different approach. Soldiers can establish footholds in a trench so that their teams' overall attack can continue, and if enough defenders are killed momentum can swift in the attackers' favor by giving them more time to take the trench. The defenders can however take back the initiative by pushing all enemy players out their trench and preventing any more players from entering until the attack phase ends.\n\nIn order for your team to be able to successfully attack and defend their trenches, working with your squad is an absolute must! But what is great about Verdun is how squad gameplay feels natural and fluid unlike other games that use a forced squad mechanic. Squads in Verdun are compromised of four men each assigned a role within a overall squad type. As of this writing, the three squad type include line infantry, recon, and assault squads. Line infantry squads can call in artillery strikes, have machine gun capabilities, accurate rifle fire and access to grenades. Recon squads are fast moving, highly accurate riflemen that can use a recon plane to reveal enemies positions to the squad. The assault squad is able to call in gas to harass the enemy, can be equipped with melee weapons (think trench clubs and shovels) and have access to advanced weaponry.\n\nWhile these squads on their own can be rather deadly, they can get much better through squad experience points you earn when you play with the same players repeatedly. As your squad levels up, each squad role will get access to better skills such as the ability to hold your breath longer and upgraded capabilities such as improved artillery strikes or a recon plane bombing run depending on what the squad type is. As you individually level up, you will unlock career points which can be used to purchase more loadouts for each squad role. This can all sound a little intimidating at first, but everything comes together seamlessly creating a highly customizable playing experience that caters to individual players' tastes.\n\nSo after spending more than 300 hours in Verdun since getting the game in October 2013, what makes me continue to come back to the trenches? Every time I play the game feels fresh and frankly just plain fun to play. One of the best mechanics of Verdun is how well paced the overall gameplay is. You can easily have a slow moment in the game where you are hanging back in the trenches waiting for the the enemy to come. Next minute, artillery is raining down all over the trench-line, gas is quick seeping in creating a deadly and terrifying sensation as you quickly dawn your gas mask. You look to your side as some of your unfortunate teammates asphyxiate to death on the fumes since they were too slow to equip their mask. Suddenly you hear a shout and see enemy players charging over the top of your trench bashing in any your teammates they see leaving you only seconds to fight them off or face certain death.\n\nIt's these little experiences in Verdun that really make the game worth coming back to again and again. The only real complaint I had and still somewhat have with Verdun is the thorny issue of optimization. Ever since the game was moved to the Unity 5 engine, it has always been difficult for a fair amount of players including me to get a consistent framerate with the game. The issue seems to be irrespective of what your hardware setup is, as I meet the recommended system requirements and I have seen users who more than meet recommended get a paltry FPS. However the developers to their credit have and continue to release numerous patches that have addressed optimization issues. There are sill annoying micro-stutters in framerate I encounter from time to time, even when there is not too much action onscreen. But again recent builds largely created a highly playable game and I am confident the developers will only improve the game further.\n\nAll in all, I cannot highly recommend Verdun enough. With exciting new squad types, game modes and maps in the works and the possibility of expansion packs in the future, Verdun has dug its foxhole and is here to stay! With that then, see you in the trenches!","April 28, 2015","true","425.1"," 164 of 177 people (93%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","93","164","177","12","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/recommended/242860/","zorder","Zorder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/","2002 products in account","After spending some hours with Verdun one I can definitely say that the game is very refreshing and a it feels like a new breath after playing Battlefield and CS: GO for years. The “Frontlines” game mode is probably one of the best modes I've played on a FPS in late years. Basically, in this mode, each team has a certain amount of time to either attack and capture the enemy trench or defend their own. Capturing a trench works like pretty much any conquest/domination mode in any other FPS on the market, get someone near the capture point to capture it ( I’m not sure if having more people near the capture point makes it so that you capture it faster). Defending a trench is pretty basic, you just need to stop the enemy from getting into your trench and capturing it. To be honest I believe that defending is always easier because you're supposed to be inside a trench, and because of that, it's harder for the enemies to spot you and kill you while, on the other hand, it's far more easier for you to kill them because they pretty much have to get either inside or really close to your trench in order to kill you, or, the enemy can just call an mortar strike or some gas to force your team out of the trench. The only gripe I have with the “Frontlines” mode is that there is no penalty for camping and not pushing towards the enemy trench when you’re supposed to. Besides the main game mode, “Frontlines”, you also have “Rifle Deathmatch” which is a Free For All mode and a recently released mode called “Attrition” which is just a fancy name for Team Deathmatch.\n\nOf course it's not all that simple. There's two teams and each team is divided into various squads and in each squad there's 4 slots, each of those slots represents a different "class" or "role". From the top of my head I can say there's the equivalent of the Sniper/Marksman on both teams, the Machinegunner, the Grenadier, the standard grunt and there's also two classes which I like to call "The Officers". These "officers" have the ability to request mortar strikes and gas on where they see fit, you just need to aim where you want and press the designated keybind. Do you see a bunch of enemies holding up on one spot on their trench? Just call in a mortar strike and in a few seconds they'll go sky high or, if you prefer, call in for some gas and you’ll either see the enemy flee from their trench or they’ll have to put their gas masks on and by doing that they’ll get a very reduced field of view. If your target is far from you and you can’t really see that well, you can also call these strikes with the help of your binoculars . The "officer" can also give move/attack orders that designate waypoints that serve as a "guide" to where the other players on the team should move.\n\nVerdun also introduces the typical multiplayer progression present on many online multiplayer FPS. As you play you'll gain experience that will increase your account rank and that experience will also increase your class rank, the experience that you gain only counts towards the class in which you're playing at any given moment, each class has it's own rank/level. Each individual class has it's own milestones for unlocking more gear and weapons. These unlocks consist of bayonets for your rifles, grenades, pistols, machineguns, rifles or scopes for a certain rifle. I feel like this is a great way to reward active players by giving them a little advantage. In each game your squad will also level up the better you do and leveling it up will unlock passives for the squad members, however the squad level doesn't save, in the next match you play your squad level will be reset.\n\nGraphically, I think I can safely say that Verdun looks pretty good, of course it doesn't look as good as other FPS such as Battlefield or Crysis but for an indie development team I think that it looks pretty damn good, however I'll say that one of the few gripes I have with the game is the animation quality, sometimes it looks pretty good but every now and then it looks to me like the animation doesn't match the speed at which a player is moving, perhaps it's just me being weird. Now, something I really like in Verdun is the music, from the main menu track to the ones played in game, for me, they hit the perfect spot in setting myself in the mood, they're really immersive and sometimes I find myself waiting for the track to kick in so I can launch myself to the field and run towards the enemy trench.\n\nStill, there's something that always bothered me about Verdun, even after it's official release, and that is the hit registration. Sometimes a part of me feels like it's my connection that's just bad but there's some times in which I'll be shooting people running across the fields, or inside the trenches, and I'll be getting a kill with each shot, and then there's sometimes in which I can shoot someone who has their back turned against me and there's no hitmark or anything and they just turn around and kill me. I don't know if it's the servers, the game or some issue on my end but when it happens it tends to be very annoying. Still, all credit to the developers, it's not as bad as it was during Early Access and I'm pretty sure they've done alot to improve this and try to resolve this issue.\n\nThen there's another separate issue entirely, which is the overall game performance. Regarding this I believe it's some limitation of Unity because there's been patches and patches and overall performance stays pretty much the same, atleast for me, even though there was a significant performance increase after the upgrade to Unity 5. With a i5 4460 running at 3.2Ghz, 8GB 1600mhz ram and a 970 running at factory clocks I'm averaging between 50-70 with everything maxed out with the exception of stuff like lens flare, depth of field, HDR and stuff like that. I mean, 50-60 fps is pretty acceptable but for a FPS I tend to find more confortable playing these types of games with abit higher FPS. Like I said, I believe it's a limitation of the engine itself and that the devs have done everything they could to improve it, still, I believe it should be taken into account.\n\nThe developers have certainly listened to the community during the whole development process and I believe that is to be praised. The developers took into account many suggestions made by the community and adressed various complaints and added things such as a mute/block option, bullet drop and team balancing.\n\nOverall, Verdun is a great game, if you can get past the lag and performance issues, and I believe that is mainly because it brings a fresh type of experience for an online multiplayer FPS by taking place in WWI and by taking a great and well done approach to the trench warfare since most FPS out there are pretty much taking place in a modern day setting. Most of the problems I had with the game during Early Access were fixed or greatly improved and I believe I can say that Verdun is of the best FPS I've played in recent years. Verdun is certainly an example for games to come on how it is possible to make FPS games on other time periods other than WWII and the modern era and, as I've said previously, the trench attack and defend mechanic is just so well executed and it brings a whole new dynamic to this kind of game.\n\nIf you're looking for good reviews, consider joining Good Games Giveaways & Reviews group.

I was above the trench as a grenadier, when I turned and saw 5 enemies crouching to attack. I had the surprise on them and quickly took 2 out with my trusty K98 AZ before I readied a grenade to throw at them. They shot me, and my body fell into the trench, with the grenade pin pulled. As they walked over me, I was holding the grenade, and soon enough, it detonated, taking the 3 remaining soldiers with me. This effectively cut off the defence's reinforcements and the left flank was entirely exposed. This marked a turning point in the offensive and soon enough we took it.\n\nThis is what Verdun is all about. It's objectives are simple, attack and defend various points on the map with your squad, with the setting being war-torn france and the Western Front. Teamwork is crucial and most of the times you'll realise that just blowing yourself up with 3 more enemy soldiers won't help your team in the long run. You have 2 factions, Central Powers and Entente powers. The central powers are the Germans, and the Entente powers are the French, British and Canadians. Along with a good detail of historical accuracy, such as the beautifully functioning SMLE or the delicate yet sturdy K98 AZ, it also has late-war weapons such as the MP-18 submachine gun.\n\nI was an Open Beta player for Verdun, ~2 years ago. To make it simple, There was only France and Germany, way fewer weapons and no gas warfare. Oh, and you could only have poilus or landsers. And there was no Gas warfare.\n\nSpeaking of Gas Warfare, one of the most unique experiences in gaming is just that. You have to carefully trudge around with a mask that impairs your visibility and gas that doesn't let you see anything more than 3 meters from you. It's scary, unique, and, to a messed-up sense, fun.\n\nVerdun is a refreshing oasis in the desert of "modern shooter" games. Personally, It brings me a sense of joy to see a unity game that I found on Kongregate grow to a sophisticated, stand-alone indie title. It, admittedly, has bugs but it's constantly being updated.\n\nAll in all, I'd reccomend you get this game, at least on sale.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/conditionzerosoldier/recommended/242860/","conditionzerosoldier","Donald J. Trump","http://steamcommunity.com/id/conditionzerosoldier/","394 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nOverview\nVerdun is supposedly the first WWI FPS. Made by two indie companies with a total of three developers, while many think such low development wouldn't be successful, the game proves them wrong.\n\nPresentation\nGraphics in this game are superb, not many people expect much more out of an indie company. There are some graphic options in the menu however I wish there was just a bit more. Currently there are no sound controls, but the developers said they will add it in at a later date. As far as the battlefields go, they are rather spectacular, however somewhat bland. There is detail in every little part, with huge craters in no man's land, dead animals in the middle of no man's land barbed wire all over, it gives the player a feeling like they are actually experiencing WWI. Currently there are three maps, but I believe that they are working on adding more, all three look authentic and believable. However there are some drawbacks. Low frame rates haunt almost every player in this beta, while not unplayable it's more annoying, especially when you get killed because your fps dropped during the action. Hopefully this can be fixed before release. (UPDATE: Devs have released an update, upgrading their engine and fixing some lag, while I still experience some, it is minimized.)  The menus are a bit buggy, but overall the devs have done a superb job on the visual side.\n\nGameplay\nGameplay is supposedly centered around you squad and your role in it. Yet with no current voice chat and little incentive to stay with your squad, your officer could be on the complete other side of the map and it would have no influence on your gameplay. However if you play with your friends and you really drive your squad based gameplay, it can actually help, turning your squad into a cruel fighting machine. This game has a leveling up system, your squad levels up with new uniforms and tech, and you have your own level, aswell as your rifles get leveled up. The leveling system needs some work as it doesn't seem like it is that responsive or effective. The main mode (or atleast what I presume is the main mode) is what their version of what the western front is. You get a set amount of time to storm the enemy trench with your team. If you can kill everyone in that trench and hold it for a set amount of time that is now your front line trench and you have to defend for the same amount of time. However if you are unsuccessful in storming the trench, you have about 30 seconds to retreat back into your trench and defend. If you don't make it back in 30 seconds you're deemed a deserter and are killed, but more on that later. I assume the gameplay is actually decently realistic, removing some factors, but is pretty fun. The other game mode is a rifle deathmatch. Basically it is a free for fall across the entire map. This is a great way to work out the maps and practice your rifling skills. One of the problems with this game is that you die way too much. It's easy to die in a normal game 30+ times. Some would call this being realistic and I get that, but at points it can just be annoying. Another aspect mentioned earlier is that if you go outside the area of the map the game wants you to be in you can be killed because you're "abandoning". If you go behind where you're supposed to, you are killed. If you leave you're trench and go forward when defending you are killed. If you're attacking and you go past their trench you are killed. This can get annoying, however it does push the WWI playstyle so it is not such a madhouse. Another annoying feature is how deadly the barbed wire is. One can simply run into them and die a few seconds later, I don't know how realistic this is, but it sure is annoying if you don't see it. The gameplay is fun, although I hope they optimize it more to make it a great game.\n\nMultiplayer\nThis game is currently solely multiplayer, however the devs had mentioned in the forums they are looking to add a multiplayer mode with bots, which I really hope they do, just incase I can't play online. As far as online goes the players are actually extremely nice. The players on this game are no Dota players, they actually help you out, even if they are on the opposite team, and I've seen that the teams have joked around with each other creating a great environment. Most everyone in the forums are nice aswell, answering my questions and inviting me to play with them when I didn't even ask. I hope that this can remain true beyond it's release.\n\nExtras\nThe devs are working on many things, they just released a nice Christmas update where there is a new Christmas map and you can throw snowballs at one another. This is a nice little addition, and unneeded, but it was nice of them to add it. The devs say that they will add more before release and I hope they can come through, The game is really spectacular for just three devs, and I look forward to more.\n\nSummary\nVerdun is a unique WWI first person shooter by a dedicated indie team that pulled it off with a great dynamic gameplay and different game modes. With a few minor drawbacks this is a great experience any first person shooter or history fanatic should checkout, and I know I'll be playing for awhile.\n\n\nEdit 02/21/2014: Developers have done an extreme amount of work to this game, making it nearly impossible to keep the review fully updated, while the review fully grasps the general sense of the game, the developers have worked on maps, classes, bugs, performance and more. Therefore the review will receive a full overhaul when the game officially releases.\n\nEdit 01/13/2014: Added side note for performance due to update.\n\nEdit 12/22/2013: Grammar fixes.","December 21, 2013","true","23.9"," 177 of 200 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","177","200","0","5"

You will die. A lot. You will fight over and over for the same stretch of land, again and again. Did I say you will die a lot? You will. A lot.\n\nBeing a veteran of the Red Orchestra 2 and Rising Storm games, dying a lot is not necessarily a bad thing to me. If I take a bullet, that means that one of my squadmates didn’t. Maybe one of them was my squad leader. Now I can spawn closer to the enemy trench! I love dying in the mud of no man’s land.\n\nThere are two game modes, but you will most likely only play Frontlines. In this mode, you fight over a small section of the Western Front where the goal is to advance and capture sectors, or defend those sectors from being captured. If an attack loses momentum, melts away in machine gun fire as it were, the roles are reversed and the defending team goes on the attack. Sometimes a team keeps on advancing, but mostly the teams go back and forth over the same stretch of bloody mud until the match is over.\n\nThe game is at its best with a full server. The maps are fairly small, and the fights are intense. It’s probably not that realistic, but it’s gritty. On of the best (and scariest) moment so far was when I had just fallen back from a failed attack and was back in my trench. I got up on the firing step and aimed my SMLE at a green cloud of bromide gas. Out of the cloud came three gray-clad Landsers in gas masks, rushing my position. I managed to take one down, but the others jumped into the trench and shot me in the back. Damn.\n\nAre you on the fence about this game? I can’t tell you if you will like this game, I can just tell you that I love this game. Have you played Red Orchestra 2 and/or Rising Storm and liked those games?

My squad and I were tasked with defending a spot on the German Third Line. I was with the French Army, I was only 20, dropped out of the University to join. I was waiting to spot something coming over those hills, anything at all. All you could see was the smoke on the horizon, and the distant sounds of gun and mortar fire. It was close to nightfall, all I had to eat was a stale piece of bread in the past 12 hours. It was almost pitch black when I saw something, I was almost positive it was something. I brought my Enfield up to my eyes to focus on that spot. My squad was spread to thin, I didnt know where they were, I was alone.\nIt had been 10 minutes since I heard anything. I was starting to think I was too tired, and was hearing things. Then I heard it again, the shuffle of something in the dirt, all my muscles tensed up. It was then when I saw the helmet, barely noticing it at all. The infamous german helmet, black and crowned with a spike. The man who came up looked as equally tired and hungry as me. I touched the cold trigger, it had been days since I last used it. The gun was loud, if I missed I would've died. I pressed the trigger, it hit something, he didnt go down. It hit the cannon behind him.\nHe looked up, right at my position. I went to pull my bolt back, and fire again. I knew I wouldnt miss again, the gun didnt fire it was jammed. I turned and ran, I had to get out of the trench. I turned the corner and stopped, I listened for any noises, I couldn't hear anything, I crouched and walked over to the ladder and climed out. I laid prone next to an abandoned wagon, it was destroyed probably by mortar fire. I laid there for the longest minutes of my life. My heart was still pounding and I thought it was screaming my position to the world. I saw the helmet again, around the same corner I was at just minutes ago. I waited for him to come around, I had a plan wait for him to pass, then shoot him from behind, he would never know, but instead he waited for hours. It was almost dawn, you could see the smallest glimpses of the sunlight.\nI thought he left to report back to a much larger German force. I was ready to climb back in to my post, and write a report for my NCO. When he turned the corner, he just walked through, he was quiet, but seemed very unaware. He passed by, here was my chance to get him. I got up, and laid down, just then I felt a sharp piercing pain in my leg, I almost yelled. It was the barbed wire, it was everywhere in between trenches. He crouched to do something, he gave me time. I sat up to get my leg out, It was hard to get yourself out of barbed wire. I then got my arms stuck in it, I couldnt get my self out, I tried just pulling my limbs, It made my cuts deeper. I was quickly losing blood, I felt my life draining. I sat there staring at the sky, until death consumed me\n\n\n\n10/10, would die from barbed wire again","May 24, 2015","true","4.1"," 148 of 170 people (87%) found this review helpful 94 people found this review funny","87","148","170","94","0"

Verdun being one of a handful of playable First World War games in existence, I was eager to fork out the $15 for the Steam beta. That was around the time the Picardie update was implemented, and I was happy to find that Verdun ran just fine on my laptop. After putting 50 hours into the three maps and finding my niche in the squad system, I can say that Verdun is only getting better.\n\nVerdun offers unique challenges and experiences that cannot be found elsewhere as a relatively simple FPS game. Currently, weapons are historically limited to bolt-action rifles, clunky machine guns, pistols, and grenades. The simplicity in weaponry helps level the playing field and keeps any one player from dominating the other team. Often when storming a trench I will cut down the first man in front of me and the man behind him will take me down while I re-chamber only to be shot by my squad mate that has (hopefully) followed behind. This unique nature of Verdun helps make it playable to most people even if they are bad at a traditional FPS, and I appreciate that.\n\nThere are still things that frustrate me about Verdun. Things like prone blocking that keep me from taking cover when it is vital, inactive players blocking the trench, the multiple shots sometimes required to kill, and the inexplicable tendency for small pieces of wood on the map to get in-between my crosshairs and the enemy. I am sure any real problems will be addressed by developers because they are undoubtedly in tune with the dedicated community of players and any useful feedback given to them.\n\nTo summarize, Verdun was worth my money and the positive trend of developer support and effort is showing no signs of lessening.\n","January 28, 2014","true","303.9"," 129 of 146 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","129","146","0","4"

I had just finished smoking my pipe and replaced my wet socks for a dry pair. My day had started off as any usual day could be in the trenches; I shaved my face and had a hole in my pants patched up. Everything was exaclty the same as the day before ever since this bloody stalemate began. That was until the whistles began to blow.\n\nThe enemy trenches echoed with chants and shouting as I peeked up to see silhouettes cresting the trench line. They were beginning their assault. Our squad leader rallied us all together to take our positions on the line. We fired shot after shot. Brass was beginning to stack up at our feet until finally, it seemed that the enemy had retreated back to the safety of their trench. They fell back leaving the wounded and dead to decorate the wasteland that lay in front of us. Our commanding officer began shouting orders but he was too far away to make out the words. Before i could catch my breath we were being signaled to begin our counterattack. I climbed over the wall and sprinted toward the enemy. I could see their line clearly now. I was getting close enough to see inside and i could see an opening that looked very inviting.\n\nI dove into the clearing and landed at the feet of 3 enemy troops. They had not seen me, so I opened fire! One down, two down, three! I had cleared the way for 2 more of my comrades to make it in. We began fighting our way down the trenchline clearing out our opposition. And boy was it a fight! We worked our way, foot by foot, deeper into enemy lines. Several of the men with me were taken out by sniper fire so I found myself alone yet again. I turned around to check my flank only to see gas billowing out toward me. I donned my mask as quickly as i could manage and hunkered down in a corner way.\n\nThe glare from my mask lense, the crack of machine gun fire above my head, my heart beating so loud it almost drowned out the screams of wounded men. At that moment, I realized.... THIS GAME IS GREAT!","January 17, 2015","true","67.5"," 94 of 98 people (96%) found this review helpful 56 people found this review funny","96","94","98","56","0"

I arrive in a trench with a bolt action rifle and a gas mask. I notice a look out post just up ahead. I set up shop, aim down my sights and look into the wastelands beyond me. I see nobody. Then suddenly the sound of a small metal object flies up next to me with an abrupt stop. I look down to my right. My comrade is laying on the floor lifeless beside me. I panic. I take aim and look back into No Man's Land; I can't see anyone. Time passes; I am still alive. I decide this is it I must make a move. I find a nearby ladder and start climbing up over the edge of my trench. I'm still alive. This is amazing, I feel not only invincible but invisible. I run as fast as I can towards the enemy trench when suddenly I stop. I look down; I am stuck, my trousers are tied up in a mess of barbed wire. I try to move forward out of it but it is of no use. A brief small winding noise flies towards me, a bullet gets lodged in my head. I have died, my corpse stuck in a mess of barbed wire, my helmet a few feet away.\n\nI respawn and return to my previous post. I take aim and look out and there he is. A head just peering over a sandbag on the edge of the enemy trench. I hold my breath, aim the gun straight at his head and pull the trigger. I've never felt so excited and rewarded for getting a single kill in my life. I stop to celebrate for a brief moment, pumping my fist in the air, only to return my eyes to the screen and see I've been killed again.

You get bombed to pieces by artillery and grenades. This is the genuine ww1 experience if you are looking for a game set during The Great War.

Survival is important, leave forlorn hope to those who want it, you want to live right?\n\nAnd then whatever idea of self preservation will be thrown out a window\n\nYour brothers in arms will start to swarm in, the enemy line reduced, dying by dozens trying to take one tiny foothold in the trenches. You'll see a teamate charge next to you and get sniped, and still, you'll get up and charge in, praying that the next bullet doesn't hit you. Because that trench has to be captured, even if you know it'll be hell. You'll hear the explosion roaring around you. You might see it happen in front of you, killing your squadmates.\n\nBodies will be sprawled across the trenches, move cautiously to clear it out, The moment you take the trench, there is no reprive, only onslaughts of mortars and toxic gas, you can't see anything, you can't tell friend from ally. Shoot shots blindly into the gas, you could've sworn you saw something moving.\n\nReload- no, he's in front of you now, charge him!

There is classes that only have a pistol with a bunch of gernades. It totally depends on your play style and preference. I absolutely love that. My favorite class is the Flanker for the Canadians.\n\nThe more I play this game the more I hope it grows. It is such a fantastic experience. The community is loyal and helpful.\n\nI need to hurry up and film this for my channel so my subscribers will feel the need to get it\n\nI hope this review makes you guys want to get it!!!!\n\n\nOriginal\n\nThe Short Version\n\nPros:\nWorld War One Trench Warfare\nAmazing atmosphere\nUpdates full of content\nWell done voice acting\nAccents done right\nMustard Gas\nDetailed soldiers\nAs far as I can tell it's historically accurate\nGood Graphics\nA lot of Unique Features\n\nBoth:\nTeamwork is required to win\nNo Bulletdrop\nRank System\nSquads with roles\n\nCons:\n[It's in Early Access so some of these Cons may be fixed]\nSometimes Bullets do not register\nLow population\nSpawn Killing\nNot newbie friendly\nInvisible walls around terrain block my shots\nTakes a Required Taste\n\n\nLong Version:\n\nHere lately I have been writing reviews as they should be written. "Do I reccommend this game?" not "Do I like this game?"\n\nThis is one fits both.\n\nVerdun is a World War One trench warfare shooter. There is nothing like it right now. I hear a lot of my friends say it looks like a Red Orchestra 2 with World War One skins. That is not true for several reasons.\n\nThere is so many unique things in Verdun that I can not compare it to any other shooter. As soon as you spawn you look out beyond your trenches and see fog covering No Man's Land [the area between the teams' trenches] with men running then falling down. Soldiers scream war cries and charge whistles blow. Bi-planes fly over head, artillery crushes your side, and Mustard Gas lurks ever so omniously. As you gaze at the breath taking sight...you got shot right in the face.\n\nYou will then try to "learn by doing". This is where a con comes in. Just like every Multiplayer only game--you'll die over and over again before you learn how to play. This is fine by me really but in Verdun it's really bad. There is a rank system. At first that sounds fine. It sounds like Call of Duty or Battlefield. Let me tell you--I don't want to hear one person complain about starting weapons in a First Person Shooter ever again.\n\nIn Verdun--you start with a pistol. I have been a Canadian on the Entente side the entire 2.7 hours I have so far so I had a Webley which is a six shooter. You start with that or whatever the Axis variant is.\n\nSo here you are--not sure what to do or where to go and you are having to defend yourself with a pistol while opposing forces are sniping you from affair. You learn to bob, weave, and hide so you can pick off a few foes with your little potato gun. Don't get me wrong you can destroy with this gun.....once....you learn how to use it.\n\nYou get your adrenaline pumping with all the booms and charge whistles accompanied by war cries. You start doing work--you follow orders, you get some kills, and hey look your team won.\n\nNext comes the XP screen and there it is--no unlocks. After awhile you realize guns are class specific. You have to level up the class you may not even realized you pick in order to get the rifles. Now it comes together.\n\nThis is fine by me--it is trial by fire--but this is going to leave a bad taste in some newbies' mouth and may either go play the dry rifle deathmatch mode or just stop.\n\nOnce I got the rifle I was doing even more work then I was doing. It was great.\n\nThe maps are all trenches but man they are all different aswell. It's so weird really. Even though it's the same concept--charge and defend--each map brings a different element to the game.\n\nSpeaking of maps let me bring up the visuals. This game in my opinion looks amazing just because of the detail. The soldiers are detailed, the maps are detailed, the guns are detailed, the bi-plane is detailed, the dead horse on this one map I found is detailed, it is just a detailed game and I love it so much. The accents are spot-on and the atmosphere just captures World War One as you have seen in pictures or in films. I got so immersed.\n\nOne thing that would help the immersion is no hud but you kind of need it at times. So I decided to leave that out of the pro, both, con list.\n\nA lot of the cons like terrain walls I won't discuss in detail because this game is in Early Access and the Devs are doing a fantastic job of cleaning this game up. Updates are frequent and they contain so much content. Just take a look for yourself.\n\nOverall--I love this game. While I think it takes a required taste to be able to enjoy this game I have to recommend it because I want to see this game grow. Only a few hundred play this game--I hope for more.\n\nSo if you are interested--go ahead and buy it","December 15, 2014","true","9.5"," 91 of 104 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","91","104","0","4"

However recently they just had a update and i've gotta say they've improved the game a lot and it looks a lot nicer too.\n\nThe game is unique in its own way because the fighting style is just like WWl and if you don't know what  i mean well then it's all pretty much trench warfare so close combat kinda stuff and it's a attack/defend style. So one side, ex. the germans, will leave their own trench and run across no mans land. No mans land is pretty self explanitory it's called that because no one wants to be there. It's covered in barbed wire (which if you run in will slow you down and kill you) and is just an open field, the only cover you can use to help yourself are the shell holes that are scatered around. While all this is going on the french are sitting in their trench with their rifles/mgs just mowing you guys down, and you're just praying that you'll somehow sneak into their trench and capture it.\n\nThe game trys to make teamplay an important thing by giving you extra points if you work as a squad. There are 4 different roles in each squad that are all unique in their own ways.\nYou have a NCO that carries a pistol and commands orders of where to attack or can place motor fire down on a position\nThere's the classic rifleman you obviously has a rifle, pretty basic\nYou can be the Support role which carrys an old WWl mg (which is ♥♥♥♥ btw) and covers your teammates as they move up or you can be that badass mowing down the enemy as they advance forward\nLastly there's the sniper which is pretty self explanitory\n\nThe game is also somewhat active, you can find games to play in and have fun and even every now and again join a full game.\n\nThe downsides.\n\nEven though you can find games like i just said it's also a down side because there are usually only 3, 4 at the most you can join.\nThe lag can be pretty bad at times and you can't vote kick people out of games. For example i was playing last night and a guy on my squad had a ping of +650. He was making the whole game lag up and there was nothing we could do and he wouldn't leave so therefor i had to leave.\nThey only have two gamemodes to play, The classic attack/defend and the other is free for all.\nFree for all is a lot of fun....IF you can get a game going. There's usually only about 2-4 people playing free for all so you're never getting the full expierence that they wanted you have with the gamemode. so you're always stuck then playing attack/defend\n\nThe other thing that's bad about this game is it's community. The people you play with are either a complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to you or don't know what the ♥♥♥♥ they're doing and while they should b rushing and attacking they are camping in the back with rifles sniping so you never advance and you lose every match. Every time i've told my team to push up or ask them why they aren't helping me they all tell me to stop complaining.\n\nOver all i give this game a solid 7/10\nI think the price may be a tad bit overpriced, i'm not saying they are ripping you off, but if this game goes on sale you should pick up a copy of it for sure.","May 3, 2014","true","7.6"," 107 of 128 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","107","128","0","2"

In December, I was really bothered by how the game didn't really feel like it was simulating trench warfare in a historically accurate way but the devs have recently added chemical weapons into the game.  This does SO MUCH for immersion because it forces soldiers to use gas masks and it's really terrifying because you can die with in 30 seconds if you don't use your gas mask.  Not to mention you can't see ANYTHING if the gas is in your area which makes everything so much more tense, realistic, and stressful.  The trench warfare is so much better too because when you invade another trench you are FORCED to run straight ahead into enemy lines just like real life soldiers had to do back then.  I forgot to mention that the graphics are 10 times better than they were originally and they just make this title shine like a hidden gem.\n\nThe only technical flaws with the game at the moment are that you will experience lots of bugs, lag, occasional crashes which will be dealt with in the future I'm sure, however, there are two things that I feel the devs can do to make Verdun an even more epic game.  The one problem that I have with the game on the whole is that you can make your own squad and let anyone in it be it your friends or strangers.  This sounds good but what REALLY ANNOYS ME is that if you leave your squad or quit the game, you'll see that random people have taken control of your squad and filled up all of the spots.  You can't really control what happens to your squad which is a real pain because your squad levels each round and basically YOU LOSE ALL OF YOUR PROGRESS IN THAT SQUAD because some random players have decided to take over the squad you made.  I WANT THE ABILITY TO CONTROL MY SQUAD COMPLETELY because it's my squad!!!!  I made it so my friends and I can play together but each and every time we play I have to make a new squad because some ♥♥♥ took my last squad!  M2H PLEASE FIX THIS!!!!!\n\nThe last problem that I have with Verdun is that I think the devs need to let players choose a secondary weapon like a revolver, pistol, and so on.  It might change the balance of the game a little but I REALLY FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT a sniper and machinegunner in WWI didn't carry a sidearm to help them in close combat should their trench be invaded.  I also think that the grenadier class as well as any other class that has just a pistol as a gun (excluding the officer class) should be given a primary weapon like a rifle.  I'm pointing this out because the pistol is horribly innaccurate and takes WAY TOO LONG to master, plus, the only close combat you'll experience is when you are invaded/invading another trench which makes the pistol kind of useless.  I'm not sure if any of the "pistol" classes were given rifles in real life but I think it'll make the game a little bit easier for new players and bring in more players for the game.  The last thing I'd like to suggest to the devs is that I think it'd be really interesting to let there be servers that have 32 players and then make servers that have 40 players, it'll add even more realism to the game given that the battles in WWI were gigantic, especially the Battle of Verdun\n\nVerdun has always been one of my favorite games in general and I'm so glad that the devs at M2H studios are true to their word because they are making a really stellar game here.  ***THERE IS ONE DETAIL YOU SHOULD CONSIDER BEFORE GETTING THIS GAME BY THE WAY.****  Verdun is EXTREMELY TOUGH and you'll die more often than the times where you kill another player.  You'll be pulling your hair out at times especially if your new but once you get a kill in this game you feel like you've done the impossible and it'll moivate you to keep pushing forward.  I also love the fact that this game isn't like COD or BF where people get INSANE amounts of kills, the best players I've seen can get up to 60 kills tops but they're A VERY SMALL MINORITY.  Most players get like 10 kills or so on average because you and your troops are focussed on grabbing enemy territory which is EXACTLY what WWI was about.  Playing Verdun again has really just made me fall in love with it again and I can't recommend this game enough.  This is one of the best early access games out there and I PERSONALLY BELIEVE that this game should be in the top ten charts of best pc games AND I ALSO BELIEVE that the devs should try to get this game on consoles to further popularize this incredible title.\n\nMy Score: 9.2/10","October 23, 2014","true","49.9"," 75 of 86 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","75","86","0","0"

I tried running it and my (now outdated) gaming laptop couldn't really run it at 30+ fps, which for me is a hard thing to get over. Well, they just released an update today with an engine overhaul and it is WAAAAY more optimized. I now can run it at 720p at 60 fps! It is really great to see a dev team put so much work into optimizing a title. As for the game, it is great, very similar to "Red Orchestra" in gunplay. Which is a good thing. Period correct weapons, realistic damage ratios, and great maps. I highly recommend it :)\n\nEDIT: Wow, it has come a LOOONG way and Verdun has officially graduated early access. Congratulations Black Mill!  You guys are a true shining example of dedicated developers :)  I think it is time I delve a little more into this one.\n\nWWI is a war that is generally overshadowed by its counter-part WWII in the media.  There just really aren’t that many movies, books, and games about WWI.  “Verdun” aims to change that at least in the gaming realm.  The developers have done a lot of research as to accurately emulate all the weapons, battles, trenches, attire, and sounds of the Great War.  I remember the first time I pushed into the enemy’s trench, there was mustard gas everywhere we all had to put on our gas masks.  One player in our battalion told everyone to get on the ground as he hurled a grenade forwards.  We trudged our way through the bodies before us, now to defend the newly taken trench.  The combat in this game is SUPERB.  The weapons feel real and have a sort of realistic weight to them when firing and even moving.  Even the few sniper rifles in the game have the early period correct form of scope with a somewhat “fish eye” lens giving everything in it a bulbous look.  Honestly, I have no qualms about this game.  The engine is also GORGEOUS, I can't wait to max it out on my rig I will (hopefully) build soon.  Don’t expect your standard FPS game though, it is very strategic with periods where you CANNOT push and have to defend or you will be shot for desertion.  The times where you attack, are so exhilarating.  I generally avoid giving games a typical rating so I will just say this,\n\nBUY IT ALREADY","January 31, 2015","true","12.0"," 56 of 60 people (93%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","93","56","60","7","0"

And will you let it happen again?\n\nYou say you'll "never forget". I think you already have.\n\n\nAt this moment, 17:11 GMT on the 23rd March 2016, the gigantic free DLC "Horror's of War" has just been released. Dozens of new players that I have never seen before have crawled out of the woodwork in a flurry of excitement. Over the last nine months the developers of Verdun have teased weekly snippets of information, details on mechanical changes, new features and optimisation patches. A quick ruffle of clothes, digital shouts of excitements, and this Wednesday evening has been long awaited. Time to settle some old scores.\n\nIt's also my one-year anniversary of playing the game.\n\nRestocked and Relocked\n\nThe number of squads has almost doubled, with the addition of US Marines, Doughboys, Belgian troops, German schutzen sentries, and German pioniers, in addition to the previous German Stosstruppen, Landsers, Alpenjaeger, British Tommies, French Poilu, Canadian Assault teams, and more. Forty new weapons have been added, including the "Wex" flammenwerfer, the G88, the Mauser C96 "Broomstick" pistol, the BAR automatic rifle, and the T-Gewehr with hide-out penetrative bullets. New squad abilities have been added, including Big Bertha, 340mm Railway cannon, smokescreens and White Phosphorus barrages.\n\nA Revival of the Old\n\nAlmost all of the animations in the game have been renewed; overhauled, they are smoother and more realistic than before; death animations have been added, each nation now has it's own unique gasmask.\n\nThe most anticipated part of the update is the key "Horrors" expansion, replete with and stuffed with savage gore. This includes dismemberment, improved ragdoll physics, death animations, screams, bloody pools, skin melting, and more corpses. This is, however, purely optional; if you have little interest in such a grotesque paradigm, then the toggle button is in the options menu.\n\nNew Objectives\n\nA new map has been implemented; in addition to the recent Fort Douaumont map, the night-time Champagne region, the most ambitious map yet, complete with underground tunnels, sandbags and trench walls is here to stay. Expect high volumes of shrapnel, machine-gun fire and keep your ears open for the sound of spitting fire.\n\nA new fourth gamemode has been added, a co-operative wave-assault online mode, "Squad Defence", where you and some sullen survivors of a forlorn assault attempt to survive against dozens of AI opponents rushing your position. They're pretty dim, and a bit buggy at this time, but they're still difficult to defend against.\n\nThe Little Things\n\nWith all these gigantic changes, it's easy to miss out on the smaller things. Ten new gramophone songs have been added, rifles now eject spent cases, textures have been fixed.  New loadout descriptions, you can no longer sight down your rifle and jump, buffs for the terrible French Chauchat, an extra bullet for the Ruby in the name of historical accuracy, gas blinds faster, is less slightly less visible, slightly more lethal and makes a sounds upon impact...\n\nOh, and it's on a new and updated Unity version too.\n\n\nWith this nine-month in-the-waiting free expansion pack, Verdun is no longer the game it was; in a digital renaissance it has become much more, building anew on the ruins of the old.\n\nVerdun is the realest, dankest most bomb-diggity Great War game on Steam. So buckle up bros, grab your Chauchats chums, strap on your helmet homies, roll up your kitbag kiddos and "Avec moi", monseigueurs, 'cause swaggity swooty, we're going for all kinds of booty. Olé!\n\n\nThanks for reading.

Verdun is not a fad, it is something you stick to and never part from. Since reaching level 100 I may not play as much anymore but everyday I check the forums for the lively community.\n\nBut the game, man the game is good.\nI have been to Ypres twice, seen the rows of tombstones and the fields of Flanders that saw some of the worst fighting in human history. Verdun does not glorify this, it is subtle in its ways yet it is also the best representation. When gas lands on top of you, you will panic to put your gas mask on as soon as possible. It's a game, the player in real life will not actually be crippled by the gas as its in the game, yet for a moment sitting at your computer you will panic and then think "Man, people actually had to endure that" The same goes for the sound of a well aimed bullet killing the man next to you, you hit the ground knowing if you poke your head up for a moment you will die. This is what I mean by subtle, it doesnt exagerrate the First World War, it portrays the war as it was, a war that coined the term "Shell Shock"\nDoes it lack depth? Yes I wont deny the game has its limitation with it being an indie game but what it does have is amazing.\n\nThe main mode you will focus on is frontlines, a turn based attack and defend mode which is hectic and brutal. you WILL be cut down by an mg as you advance on their trench, you WILL be pounded with artillery as the enemy attempt to dislodge your defence and you WILL be in for some close combat when you are clearing a trench. The best games you have ever played can be loses, as you push back the enemy from your final trench. It is beyond hardcore, my first game saw me getting one kill and around twenty deaths as I thought "Hey I wonder if I just poke my head up above the trench quickly I might get a kill" *crack* headshotted. Ever wondered what the bottom of a shell crater looks like? Well get ready as thats what you will see a lot of as a Lewis gun is pumping rounds over your head in effort to push you back. The greatest rush can be diving into the enemy trench alone and doing your best to hold the foothold whilst clearing the enemy out as quickly as possible, the greatest relief being the sight of a friendly reinforcements diving in to help you.\n\nVerdun is a game that is always changing, new FREE DLC has been teased for some time by a hard working team of devs who always keep the players in the loop regarding development. So watch this space\n\nEDIT: The new dlc dropped recently! Over a good number of weeks players were allowed to work on the beta for the dlc to help the devs iron out issues and that was a great idea! It shows just how enthralled the community is with this game. As for the FREE dlc its more squads and new weapons of war which add all new play styles, a new map and Squad Defence which is a wave defence mode against bots that you can play with your friends (Like Nazi Zombies, but WW1 and no Zombies and no stupid power ups...so its not like Nazi Zombies) There is also gore which brings the horrors of war to life in powerful, shocking and yet respectful ways. Another reason to get this game, there is still more to come\n\nOne personal note for this game. I am a history nerd and the second world war is my area of expertise (I use that for want of a better term as I am no expert and to use "Passion" would be cliche). I played Verdun and became enthralled with the First World War. On that note do not expect Red Orchestra, two different wars and two different games and Verdun plays very differently as did the first world war. Verdun dares to be different and it pulled it off with the best historical shooter PERIOD. It is fun, it is real, it is historical and I cannot fault this game.\n\nBuy this game, die, kill, charge into hell and back and hopefully I will see you out there\n\nGott Mit Uns","January 17","true","189.7"," 45 of 47 people (96%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","96","45","47","4","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeeJaxOff/recommended/242860/","TeeJaxOff","TeeJax <3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeeJaxOff/","3936 products in account","Verdun is an amazing FPS shooter with beautiful graphics that goes back to warfare as it used to be and focuses on cooperative squad play.\n\nVerdun takes you away from what you seem to find in modern shooters and puts you back in good old trench warfare where you must rely on your squad-mates and teamwork to survive. Rather than gathering kill streaks for care packages and loading yourself up with perks you'll simply pick a position in a squad, adjust your loadout accordingly and you're thrown right into the trenches. Instead of an every-man-for-himself approach to things Verdun keeps the focus on teamwork and it achieves this by appointing an NCO (essentially a captain) to every squad who can issue orders throughout the game.\n\nThe main gamemode of Verdun (and my personal favourite) is Frontlines where you'll find yourself and your squaddies playing tug-o-war for a long stretch of land, periodically pushing and attacking or retreating and defending. You'll find yourself dug into your trenches when you start and your first objective will either be repelling the enemies attack or attacking their trenches yourself. The attacking team will have strategic points along the enemy trenches which they must assault (the other team will be defending these points during this time). Your job as the attacker is to clear out the enemy trench claiming the land for yourself and once you do your enemies will be forced to retreat to a trench further back and hold that ground instead. On the other hand if the defenders succeed at repelling the attack they will keep hold of their land and immediately be able to launch an assault on the opposing team. This will continue back and forth until one team has taken all the land from the opponents and captured their HQ or until the time runs out in which case the win goes to the team holding the most land.\nInstead of rushing forward you'll have to plan your attack carefully, following any helpful commands your NCO may issue you along the way. Frontlines (like the rest of Verdun) rewards you for taking your time and scouting out your enemies and if you try to take a kamikaze approach to things you'll likely find yourself dying quickly and repeatedly. This is a major advantage to the game over many other FPSs as you'll find yourself learning to play properly and focus rather than hoping that a huge amount of luck will be on your side.\n\nThere are other game modes besides Frontlines and these include: Attrition which is a team deathmatch style mode where you each have tickets which are lost upon someone dying. Once a teams tickets have been depleted the opposing team wins. Rifle Deathmatch is a free-for-all upon which you choose your weapons when you enter the game and can level those up by killing other players unlocking things such as bayonet attachments. The player with the most kills at the end is victorious. The last game mode is Squad Defense where you play single player in a squad and must defend against waves of oncoming AI enemies until you are eventually wiped out. Each game mode has it own allure but Frontlines is the most popular and you'll find the majority of players spend their time in that mode though you'll not have trouble finding games in the other modes.\n\nSquads are one of the main features of Verdun and there are 12 of these to choose from (if I'm correct). Squads have different perks and abilities which are unique to that squad and the same goes with the 'classes' you'll find within each one. Each squad is made up of four different 'classes' some of which include the Oberjäger or Guide, Scharfschütze or Tireur d'élite, Überwacher or Observateur and the Aufklärer or Éclaireur and each of these squads and classes have their own load-outs and play-styles. For example the Scharfschütze is a marksman class and prefers lots of distance between him and his unlucky targets, whereas the Aufklärer excels at melee and needs things to be up close and personal. Choosing which squad and class you play will greatly affect how your outcome so it'd recommend giving each squad/class a try until you find what is right for you because they truly all do play very different. Each squad will also have an NCO who will appoint attack and defend orders for the rest of the squad to carry out. Attacking/Defending these targets and/or remaining within your NCO's command range will award you with extra points and will help your squad level up unlocking various different things for you such as perks and even some additional classes. Although the desire to do your own thing can be strong the gameplay really is geared towards teamwork and you'll find very few situations where going solo reaps a better outcome than going as a group but the choice is still yours and you are not forced to follow orders.\n\nI think one of the graphics of Verdun are amazing and I find myself admiring them every time I play. The attention to detail and sparce placement of objects adds to the immersiveness in-game and together with the artillery bombing and rifles sounds going off creates a perfect war atmosphere.\nAlso the in-game community seems to be refreshingly nice which is a rarity in most first person shooters I've played so that was welcome. Rather than abuse there seemed to be a lot of friendly interaction between people and players were willing to help when a question was asked.\n\nMy only issue with Verdun is the fact it can be very difficult at first and some may find that offputting. It took me a good few games until I really felt comfortable and at first  it was frustrating feeling like I couldn't move without being killed. This quickly changes though if you're willing to take a game or two of hardcore defeat and soon you'll find yourself playing as well as you would in any other FPS.\n\nI can see why Verdun came highly recommended to me as it is a stand out game in the FPS genre. The gameplay, though challenging, is very rewarding and actually feels like a war game in terms of realism. Anyone looking for a realistic trench warfare experience with solid gameplay need look no further as this more than hits the spot. A must try for HARDCORE fans of the genre and those looking for a true challenge, immersive graphics and a great community.","May 5","true","10.7"," 44 of 47 people (94%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","94","44","47","4","0"

In a nutshell -well worth the money even though it's currently in Beta. There is a small developer team that are active and constantly improving  the gameplay. The community in this game is supportive and constructive as a whole. Having come directly from Rising Storm / Heroes of Stalingrad there are similarities; differences are evident in the weapon dynamics,hit location, movement and tactics. There are no tanks to help  storm through defences , disrupt and draw enemy fire. Verdun is a meat grinder where every trench held or taken is often paid for in lives.\n\nThe battlefield terrain for each map is well researched, each map is a challenge in it's own right. The graphics now are more detailed especially in ultra settings. Rag doll physics lead to some interesting positions for the dead. Animations will likely need to be improved especially those poor devils hit by artillery. Currently they fly through the air intact.\n\nEach match is a battle of frontal assault in attack and defence with high casualty figures reaped from the attackers due to the channelling effect of wire, small arms, grenades,machine guns, artillery and gas.\n\nWeapons are deadly in their own right and it is easy to see why the Mauser and .303 SMLE were retained and improved. As you progress in the game in points you get weapon and ability unlocks according to the role you choose in each team you join. There are some very good players in the game and these may tend to pack together as team unlocks are much faster. Beginners can level these masters with one shot, team dynamics, positioning  and player ability are the deciders in both holding and taking trenches.\n\nThe question is can you survive the fire get through  and make a breach in the defence? Once you are in the enemy trench start to clear it - exploit the enemy backs with your trusty weapon bayonet / melee weapon team while they face and shoot your side. Reducing the firepower at your team. As a defender can you drive the enemy away within your field of fire, do you need to move and protect another section of trench? All the while remaining situationally aware of a potential enemy invading your trench.\n\nIn game smoke shells or poison gas plays a deadly role in masking both attackers and defenders adding to the claustrophobic condition of the trench interiors and no mans land where you must adjust to the fighting in a gas mask.There are some very good players in the game and these may tend to pack together as team unlocks are much faster.\n\nAchievement hunters and badge collectors will get plenty of mileage from the game. So far no hackers detected apart from a bug glitch / exploit that has now been corrected.\n\nMy experience of game server activity when I have been on - the US  is by far the most active; Australian / Asia Pacific servers improve in the afternoons and Europe is fairly quiet due to the time difference (gamers are sleeping). I can say you will always get a game with the ping issues not too bad. Personally I have always done well either with low or high ping when the end game scores come in.\n\nLook forward to seeing you in game.","April 3, 2015","true","403.4"," 43 of 47 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","43","47","0","0"

There's only one way to describe the decline of this game. Tragic. Why tragic? I bought this game in January of 2015 and between then and May, this game was perfect. Hit detection was not too bad, Machineguns weren't so buggy and FPS was good enough to make the game playable. However, when the DEVs started to add useless eye candy, messing around with MG deployment, fixing the hit box, etc. the game was essentialyl ruined.\n\nPlaying Verdun feels more like an obligation rather than an enjoyment since I'm in a clan mainly because the pure characteristics of the game prevent me from even playing it. Point blank shots to the chest don't kill people all the time, 5 stabs in the back don't kill people anymore, barbed wire can stop a bullet from hitting someone, the actual MG can block the bullets to protect the gunner and so on and so forth. My FPS dropped from 60 FPS back in April to around 15-25 FPS these days, on all low graphics. Picardie was by far my favourite map back in April and May because it was big and open and it was fun to play. Now that map is impossible to play and less enoyable than Flanders for me purely because the DEVs added useless eye candy like dead horses, cooking stoves, chairs, tables, etc. that lowered my FPS, decreased the amount of well-aimed shots that would get registered and overall just made that map incredibly laggy. The only reason why I say all this is because I care a lot for this game.\n\nThis is one of my favourite games ever and I will continue to play no matter how much worse it gets. I go back to my original statement; the DEVs have managed to ruin their own game when it was so good. People don't care about the eye candy and the graphics nearly as much as they care about actually being able to play the game properly. The core community here isn't the new players who buy the game when it goes on sale, the core community is the people who have owned thsi game for a while and play it regularly. People from clans like KK, Pirates, Crossed Rifles, etc. are constantly complaining on the forums about problems with the game yet, instead of fixing the game the DEVs make it worse. The DEVs listen more to the new players who want this added and that added and that removed and hat changed and this improved, etc. None of our concerns have really been addressed. This games ahas just recently gone competitive with a Verdun League, yet we might not be able to continue with the league fi the game basically favour speople with a better computer. How is this in any way fair? When the Verdun League was originally conceptualised, the game was perfect, it coudl be played in a competitive environment. Now, I really don't think it can.\n\nNow for those of you reading this to see if you want this game, here's what I have to say. Even if the game becomes unplayable to the point where it's s truggle to get even 10 kills, I will still play this game EVERY day because it's one of a kind and no matter how much I hate the DEVs for ruinign this game, I appreciate the fact that they care about their game and even though they have released it they conitnue to try and fix their game.","September 5, 2015","true","937.5"," 65 of 82 people (79%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","79","65","82","4","7"

First looking at the trailers and such like half a year before writing this, i didn't think much of it, but i decided to give it a shot when it was on sale on christmas. And what a christmas it became....\n\nTL;DR\n\nPros\n\n+Epic atmosphere\n+Great core gameplay\n+Authenticity (To some extent)\n+MUSTARD GAS\n+Squad based gameplay\n\nCons\n\n-Arcady BS elements (Such as hitmarkers, crosshairs, score/kill feed)\n(Disabling above mentioned BS (hitmarkers, crosshairs) will handicap you.)\n-No dedicated servers\n\nAnd for those who want a little reading..!\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nVerdun has a truly epic atmosphere and it gives the player a true trench warfare experience. The game starts you off with some classic music from the era, and right from the start puts you in the right mood to crawl in mud attacking... Or to bitterly fight for every last inch of your trench.\n\nSo, instead of vague flags or areas, you're fighting for actual trenches and not just some 10x10 meter area on the map. The core gameplay is very simple and it WORKS. If you start off as the attacking team, your team will (hopefully) give its best shot at attacking the enemy trench and try to capture it. If the attack fails, you have to fall back to your trench and its the opposing teams time to attack. However, if you manage to capture the enemy trench, a counterattack will be ordered and you have to go from offensive to defensive really fast to keep it. In theory the whole match CAN be just one attack phase, if the attacking team is fighting fanatically enough, and the defenders holding ground steadfast.\n\nAll those times you've been THIS close to capturing the enemy trench, but you run out of momentum and have to fall back, is just what trench warfare is all about. I cannot put in words how satisfying it feels when capturing the enemy trench after a long stalemate of neither side gaining any victories, but then... You finally manage to do it and prepare for the enemy counterattack. And it feels really really good to take the enemy trench and If all goes well and you repulse the counterattack, then its time to put your skills to the test on the next trench.\n\nHowever, the arcady crosshairs and kill feeds and all that scoregarbage eat this atmosphere away, but not enough to ruin the experience, atleast for me. Sure, you can disable the crosshair, or bind the whole hud under a button to show it, but this puts you at a disadvantage, so it would be just handicapping yourself. And for the love of god.... HIT MARKERS WHY???????? But overall, the gameplay is nice, it could be alot better if they had decided to nurture this atmosphere the game has AND REALISM, instead of the crap i mentioned just now.\n\nIt has leveling and whatnot too, but you can't get a dramatic boost over a noob with just the unlocks.... unless it's the squad unlocks. Squad level can only be raised by playing with your friends, over and over again, which is nice. The squad level can basicly turn your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ little mortars into a real artillery storm. Oh and you can unlock mustard gas, damn is that deadly.\n\nOverall i'd give it a 7/10. It's very fun, Best enjoyed with friends!\n\nSee you in the trenches, comrades. And remember, Keep calm & STELLUNG HALTEN!\n\nI Might Write more to this review when i have the time :D","April 27, 2015","true","340.8"," 50 of 60 people (83%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","83","50","60","7","9"

From gunshots flying by my head throwing me into a daze, to my dear friends dying (and respawning) around me, this game made feel something I haven't felt in an FPS in a game in a long while: It immersed me in its world and made me feel like a real WW1 soldier. And dear sweet lord, it feels good.\n\nI can feel it in my head, my love. The urge to roleplay seethes through me. I want to leap onto my desk and charge foward as my allies do whenever the general calls for a charge, and I can feel my heart racing when I fail to capture a point and must fall back to my trench. I feel like I must watch every single area around me. And if I fail to observe a single thing in this drab, grey/brown world, it oftentimes costs me my life. Every shot matters, accuracy is key, and knowing the positioning of my body can mean the difference between life and death. And let's not talk about how my gas mask barely fits over my head. But hey, at least it lets me breathe through the toxic yellow gas. But do not worry, my love: The medical coverage is wonderful here, so I come back with everything intact with no seeming consequence.\n\nThe world is very gray, and sometimes, the textures of the world seem to flash in and out. Even worse, I can see the nether space that makes up our world disappear from the ground beneat my feet. War is hell, but by god, I hope it fixes the graphics in this texture-popping world. It's a scary sight to behold. And perhaps I have not been here long enough, but oftentimes I struggle to discern allies from foes, which often leads to my death. (Until I discovered that there is no friendly fire in this world. I must keep that in mind next time. Always shoot first and ask questions later)\n\nI cannot customize the way I look, so don't worry about the socks I requested from before. As well, I don't like my uniform the way it is right now. This blue uniform makes me look a flashing neon light in a dark room screaming, "HEY GERMANS! PLEASE SHOOT ME".\n\nMy time runs short, so I must keep this letter brief. As time goes on, I will be more than willing to send more letters to update the progress of the war. But know that I will be doing my best here. It's an ugly world and the things to do here are very repetitive, but overall, it's quite a nice place to be in.\n\nI love you, *name is rubbed off*. I will be sure to write to you again soon.\n\nP.S.

Verdun defies expectations with its historical accuracy when it comes to trench warfare, and its realism where one shot can be fatal.\n\nVerdun is a Unity-based game, and as such, it runs great and looks great. Battlefields are detailed enough to create a decent environment, however they still aren't as great as other games (such as Insurgency). You play as a soldier fighting on the front lines in World War 1, where much of the war is fought in trenches dug into the ground and gas attacks are common. You and your squad need to work as a team to cover all angles and play well. Here are some of the pros and cons.\nPros+ Good community\n+ Team-based gameplay\n+ Few performance issues\n+ A different kind of FPS, not generic whatsoever\n\nCons- Environment could be a bit more detailed\n- Few full servers\n- Lacks return-appeal\n- Multiplayer only\n\nIs it worth it? For sure. I would recommend buying it on sale though, you can snag a great deal.\nSo, long story short:\nVerdun is excellent at bringing a long past due change of pace to the FPS genre, but has a few caveats which you should be aware of.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Original_Curators_Group","November 8, 2015","true","4.5"," 44 of 51 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","44","51","0","0"

The central game mode sees each team starting in their own trench with one team attacking and one defending. If the attackers can't get a foothold in three minutes, they go on the offense while the other team switches to defense. If the attacking team get a foothold in the enemy trench, the time is extended. If the attackers capture the enemy trench, they must defend against a counter-attack before attacking the next enemy trench line.\n\nThis is a great game mode that feels historically accurate and also means that if one team is struggling on the offense, after a few minutes they will go on the defense so it never turns into a frustrating meat-grinder for either team. Trying to get across No Mans Land as the attackers is absolutely terrifying, while fighting in the trenches is tense and exciting. Several historically pertinent mechanics like Gas attacks that force you to put on a view-limiting gas-mask, or barbed wire you can get tangled in instead of just being a wall, add to the atmosphere and the gameplay in a meaningful way.\n\nThe squad system means that you are given access to a good variety of weapons and abilities, although you will need to enjoy bolt-action rifles to have fun with this game. Some rifles feel all-around better than others, which while historically accurate can lead to some frustrating gameplay if you get stuck with a class that uses one of the lesser rifles.\n\nWhile the game in its current state is totally playable, it would benefit greatly from some spit-and-polish. Ragdolls are jittery and can break immersion. Hit detection leaves much to be desired. The current system for joining servers has you picking a squad instead of a server, and you can't see what the ping is when doing this. However I seem to have exactly the same ping no matter what server I join, which makes me think all of the servers are centralized which is not ideal.\n\nOverall if you enjoy games like Red Orchestra 2 or Insurgency and are interested in the WW I setting, Verdun is a game I would highly recommend. The central game mode is excellent and the maps are generally well designed with one or two exceptions that have huge no-mans land zones that are impossible to make it across in the given time as the attackers.","June 7, 2015","true","13.0"," 34 of 37 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","34","37","4","1"

Been playing it about a year (i think) and while its still in early access, it feels and plays out as real and finished game- did so when i bought it way back. I honhestly hesitated to buy it when it was on sale, because while as history geek i always wanted ww1 game, i never tought it actually had potential to be fun. Well, i was wrong about latter part- this game is fun as hell!\nGraphics are great- maybe not best, but atmosphere they create is fantastic.\nSound department is also great, as is weapons, squads (basically factions- currently it has 7 squad types (3 for central powers (i.e germans), 4 for entente (2 french, 1 canadian and 1 british) split in 2 factions (entente and central powers). Each squad type is split into 4 unique classes, so you got plenty to discover\n\nHowever, if you expect fast-paced combat like call of duty is, you have to look elsewhere, as this game plays out bit more like Red Orchestra, though bit more arcade-y. You need teamwork to win- killing every enemy doesnt bring you victory or even most points. You have to defend when, well, you defend and attack when you (isnt it obvious) attack. Always try to stay in target trench though\n\nThere are still some faults however, such as some classes start with only melee weapon (and melee weapons are near useless in Verdun game), you can very easily get killed when completely in cover (according to devs, it will be fixed next update).\n\nWhat makes this game even better, however, is multiple experience types- each class has its own xp meter, 4 levels, each with unique weapon selection. Also you have personal xp meter, which ups your rank and also squad xp (to encourage you to play with friends), which gives you later war uniforms and better artillery.\n\nBasically there is so much positive about this game that few minor bad things are basically irrelevant. I could go on and on about this game, but i stop here.\nbuy it. you wont regret it.","February 9, 2015","true","172.0"," 34 of 38 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","34","38","2","0"

As of now the lobbying system can be wonky at certain points, but nothing as extreme as a simple restart couldn't fix and even that isn't very often.\n\nThe gameplay is smooth and it plays as you would expect a true-grit trench warfare game to play. Each person plays a special role in a squad.The squad system implements nationalities and their specialities which is a nice change of pace but still reminiscent of Battlefield's squad system if you're familiar. The attack and defend style play is also unique and really makes you believe this is how your ancestors probably got it done. Sharp rifling skills, smart MG nest emplacements, and well placed mortar, recon planes and mustard gas are required for victory.\n\nAll in all, it's intense, you'll die a lot, and you'll need a good squad to pull through but it wouldn't be nearly as rewarding without it. For $20, it's a good deal, on sale, it's a steal.

But let’s speak about positives first:\n\nPros\n\n- well-designed extensive maps inspirited by real battlefields of WWI\n- satisfying and challenging gunplay\n- broad gameplay variability based upon different classes to play with\n- required cooperation between squad players in order to win\n- friendly and helpful community\n- solid optimization\n\nVerdun is a good game, very good indeed but it fails to deliver the most crucial game experience:\n\nCons\n\n- nothing like an immersive WWI trench warfare experience\n\nWell, WWI looked anything but this. Few players camping throughout a waste battlefield make the game pretty infuriating and in time it only gets worse. Verdun will become BORING for many players as it became for me and this lack of players is exactly what buries the game underground.\nNot to mention another great problem with\n\n- feels like still playing BETA\n\nBefore the supposedly full game release, there was a lot updates and a lots of gigs to download, containing some bug fixes but now, the game is in the same state as it was in beta. I was very disappointed about this literally forced 1.0 release and I'm still waiting for major upgrades in shady areas like\n\n- infuriating lag\n\nIn the game which is more or less about precision I fail to comprehend how it is possible for developers not to improve upon teleporting moving players which happens all the time!\nI'd like to blame myself for mistakes I do in game like Verdun where I die constantly, but this is deliberately very bad coding and no one seems to give a f__k.\n\n- buggy bugs\n\nThe game even though it is supposed to be now in a full release state still suffers from numbers of persisting bugs and lags. I'm convinced developers will fix majority of them in time, because they really care about their product, which is worth mentioning again.\n\nDo I recommend this game?\n\nIt depends to whom. I have no hesitation of recommending Verdun to anyone interested in WWI warfare even though it fails to deliver the genuine experience but for a casual player the game might quickly become boring and frustrating.\nI've spent over 120 hours into the game and I don't regret it, neither the investment, 'cause it was a very FUN to PLAY, but I don't think I'll play again until the core game mechanics will be improved.","April 20, 2015","false","143.6"," 118 of 182 people (65%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","65","118","182","7","11"

Imagine extreme trench warfare, mustard gas, tons of different bolt action rifles, lugers, mortar fire, running from cover to cover in no man's land, mowing down enemies with the heavy machine gun! This is a lot of fun, it encourages teamwork even though there's limited VOIP, what I and many others will do is relay the enemies' position in team chat, such as "LEFT SIDE" if the enemy has breached our position on the left side of the trench, or is about to. One may view the lack of VOIP as a negative, but on the plus side you're less likely to hear any screaming squeakers on the mic and go through the effort of going in the menu and muting them. If you play as the officer class you can call in mustard gas strikes, mortar strikes or air recon (depending on the type of squad you're in) by holding Q and right clicking. The game is somewhat realistic, it only takes one shot from a bolt action rifle to kill someone and you need to use cover, but there's no friendly fire and there are crosshairs. If you like realistic, yet fun shooters, like Insurgency, you're gonna like Verdun. Like Insurgency, the developers keep adding content in free updates (they've added 2 new maps since I've owned Verdun), so I highly recommend this unique shooter as it gives you far more bang for your buck than your typical AAA shooter that charges $50 for a season pass.\n\nEDIT: I just found out that they recently added VOIP, but it's limited to your squad only. The developers are adding free expansions that will include gore, new maps, the trench gun, flamethrowers and new squads, including the Americans and Belgians and in future expansions they'll add more fronts, such as the Eastern front between Russia, Germany and Austria-Hungary and many more.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/krazysigmarite/recommended/242860/","krazysigmarite","Ben","http://steamcommunity.com/id/krazysigmarite/","309 products in account","I went into this game rather skeptically - a lot of historical shooters tend to fall into a difficult spot with regards to the way they are played. Most games end up as a classic deathmatch or a camping simulator with old timey costumes, particularly WW2 games. Red Orchestra and Heroes & Generals, despite being two very good 'simulator shooter' games, both suffer from this problem quite heavily. With Verdun, you can set aside those worries now.\n\nVerdun manages to break away from that mold by heavily incentivising players to fight in the style of trench warfare. Every battle is fought in a series of 'phases' - one side defending, one side attacking. While defending, if you venture to far towards the enemy lines, you will be considered deserting and killed. If you don't charge forward while attacking, you essentially forfeit the round. Run too far from your trench and you will be killed for desertion. In this way, the game keeps the maps expansive, but enclosed: a perfect size for a medium-scale skirmish that captures the feeling of fighting over a small slice of a much larger war.\n\nBelieve it or not, trench-style tactics work and really give this game a strong feeling of immersion. If your squad trickles in slowly while on the glorious attack, your men will be picked off quickly and accomplish nothing. But if your entire team charges in a human wave, the enemy simply cannot keep up and will likely be overwhelmed. Then comes the gritty, brutal close-quarters fighting to hold down the trench, stabbing with bayonets, bashing with spiked clubs, and desperately firing off bolt-action rifles at point-blank.\n\nA wide variety of weapons are available - pistols, machine guns, bolt-action rifles, et cetera - and you will unlock various side-grades as your soldier gains career points, keeping the game fresh and fun.\n\nCurrently the game has a nice array of nations represented: The United Kingdom with its Canadian dominion troops and France currently represent the triple entente, while the central powers are represented by the German Empire. Apparently the United States and Austria are to be represented soon, though these may simply be rumours.\n\nOverall, the game is a highly welcome addition to the historical shooter genre, and is incredibly addictive and fun to play, and is, in my opinion, far superior to the other options currently available, overtaking even Tripwire's 'Rising Storm' for amazing, brutal gameplay and attention to detail. You would be doing yourself a disservice to miss this one!\n\n\n\nPS:\nSadly, no ANZAC or Ottoman Empire troops or costumes are represented in-game yet, but are the Developers really surprised people are asking for them?

Truly, there was not a more normal day here on the western front. I crouch in my dugout with my buddy Hanz; we have a picture of glorious Kaiser Wilhelm captioned, "Gott Mit Uns!" hanging on the wall. I stroke his majestic waxed moustache for good luck. The whistle blows. Stuffing the picture in my jacket, I leap over the top with Hanz following right behind me.\n\nThere is a boom. I am showered in a torrent of blood as Hanz is blown apart by a mortar round directly to the sternum. Lying on the ground with most of his ribs and vital organs nowhere to be seen, Hanz shouts, "Nice mortar!". In the distance, I hear a Brit shout back, "Thanks mate!". RIP Hanz. Nevertheless, I charge on right at the baguette twirling Poilu, who, glass of wine in one hand, white flag in the other, cry "Mon Dieu!" as I jump into the trench and begin skewering them for Der Kaiser. All surrender. None survive. The incest-ridden Tommies are coming now. One shouts, "Oii! It be 6'bong ya git! That's tea time, you damn hun!" and he fires his Lee Enfield at me. Not being of superior German quality like my Ruhr made Gewehr, the bullet invariably bounces off my Pickelhaulbe and kills the Canadian's goaly. I then take a shot and blow all of the crooked teeth out of the Brit's mouth. The Canadians are mad that their goaly's dead though, so they run at me hockey sticks drawn, shouting, "Eh! You hoser! You ruined our game, eh!" Sadly, most, drunk on maple syrup, trip on the slippery ice and crack their skulls. Those that make it to me begin to beat me with their hockey sticks. I feel numb. Then, all is white. All is quite. Der Kaiser reaches his hand out to  me and I take it. I have no fear for Der Kaiser is with me now. Der Kaiser sees all. Der Kaiser hears all. Der Kaiser is all. Heil Der Kaiser!\n\n\n-=November 11th, 1918=-\nNEWS FROM THE FRONT:\nGermany's forces prevail as the French all surrender and the British swim back home to watch soccer, using their teeth to carve boats out of trees. The Canadians summarily abandoned their posts and beat each other to death after a controversial hockey game. German boots beat on the streets of Paris!

Once you get used to the fact the damage model is very similar to Red Orchestra/Rising Storm you'll be fine!\n\nSo the main selling point of this game has to be the fact it's set in WW1 and Trench Warfare, it's different to other FPS's out there and that's why it's so good!\n\nWithin the game you have squads which are 4 men teams and consist of different roles, the roles are named differently for each faction but they're all the same really.\n\n--[ Squad Roles ]--\n\n-[ Corporal ]-\n\nThe Corporal is the lead element of any squad. They set the attack orders and can call in either recon planes, artillery and gas.. It's a case of one of the other and depends on what 'faction' you play as. Generally I play as the Tommies due to being british :P\n\n-[ Rifleman ]-\n\nThe Rifleman is,.. well... your bog standard rifleman, you can upgrade the class so you can get your rifle mouted with a long range scope, this effectivley makes you become a marksman. It's a fun class to play and I highly reccomend this one if you cannot get to be the Corporal.\n\n-[ Machine Gunner ]-\n\nSo the Machine Gunner has a LMG you cannot sprint with this weapon due to it being heavy, but you can mount it on certain things around the map because you have a bipod. This is amazing for supressing the enemies while the rest of your squad move up to the enemy trench(es). If you get the Tier 3 upgrade for the MG (This is on the Tommies faction, not too sure if it's the same for the others) you can have a rifle and a MG. If you equip the rifle you can sprint to where you want to be, get the MG out and mount up! Another awesome class to play as when working with a team.\n\n-[ Bomber/Grenadier ]-\n\nThe bomber/grenadier class is pretty much identical to the rifleman unless you go for the tier 2/3 upgrade. tier 2 gives you a pistol and 4 grenades. (Grenades are amazing! The blast radius is a nice size to damage people who try to run from a thrown 'nade) If you go for the Tier 3 upgrade you get a pistol, trench club.. Yes. a big wooden club which you beat people to death with and 2 grenades. Tier 1 is a Rifle and 2 Grenades... possibly a pistol too..\n\n\nIn order to maximise your fun in this game you need to play with friends, you need to have communication in your team too, so make sure to press 'U' to type to your team and let them know where the enemies are pushing, you'll find you win more matches, If you're  a Corporal or equivalent. Please for the love of god ask where people need arty / tell them where you have put arty. Set orders too! It's bonus EXP for your squad mates!\n\n--[ Gamemodes ]--\n\nSo far in Verdun there is only 2 gamemodes. Frontlines and Deathmatch.\n\n\n-[ Frontlines ]-\n\nFrontlines game mode is where you have to push and try to take the oppsition's trench, once taken you need to defend the counter-attack. After you successfully take the enemy trench, you take the next one. Simple concept but some of the maps are quite... strange and you have to adapt your play style to the maps too!\n\n-[ Deathmatch ]-\n\nDeathmatch is pretty much what it says on the tin. Every man for himself. It just reminds me of CoD... I wouldn't reccomend it unless you're seriously bored.\n\n-[ Private Matches ]-\n\nYou can also host private matches so if you're part of a competive team.. Yes. It's recent addition to Verdun :P You can practice certain tactics and study the maps without the hassle of people shooting at you ;)\n\n\n--[ So, Downsides to Verdun ]--\n\nThe only downsides I can really think of this game is when you create a squad and try to play with friends it will kick some people back to the main menu, this means your friends have to search for your squad in the left hand side when they choose to play "Frontlines" gamemode.\n\nIn order to "add" people on Verdun you need to play with them in a previous squad or be in a match with them. To add them you press Tab (leaderboards) then right click your friend and click the "Add" button. Sorted! You can now make private squads.\n\nIf you're also playing with people from different regions (EU/US) you need to make sure you change it at the top right so everyone is on the same region otherwise you won't be able to play together.\n\n--[ Conclusion ]--\n\nIf you really into FPS Games which have a realistic damage model then I highly suggest this game. If you're looking to play a casual shooter, Verdun can be quite... rage inducing. BUT If you're willing to stick it out and learn the maps and how the shooting model works you'll be fine and you'll start loving the game! If you're not too sure whether this is the game for you or not. Wait until it's on sale or something, that way you're not spending as much on something you might not possibly like.\n\nThank you for reading this review.

I've only had it for two days, but I've almost been playing it all the time since I got it!\nThe squad system is a lot like the one known from many Battlefield-titles: You respawn in the trench closest to no mands land or on your squad leader.\n\nThe setting of the game is the Western Front, WWI. The game offers a great idea of the soldiers' lives in the trenches. If you don't keep your head down you're gonna get shot by a sniper. But the enemy's assault has to be repelled or you might just find it that your trench is suddenly overrun by enemies shooting and stabbing their way through your lines!\nWhen assaulting the enemy trench, the enemy machinegun and sniper fire will probably kill most of your comrades. When you realize you have to get to cover and you jump down a grenade hole, the machinegun fire flying over your head is suppressing you, your vision is getting blurred, and you're just waiting for your chance to get out of this place. But don't stay to long: an enemy squad leader may have seen you and called for a mortar strike right in your grenade hole.\n\nTEAM WORK is the key! Working together, following orders and staying close to your squad leader grants points to you and your squad, eventually leveling up your squad thus unlocking better abilities and heftier fire support. As in real life a squad is not better than the soldiers in it: A squad can very well be level 20, but when you split up and a soldier leaves the squad, the squad level falls drastically according to the squad points he had provided. The points are based on team work and cooperation between the members of the squad. For instance if a new man joins the squad and has never played with any of the squad members before he will not contribute to the squad level before he has been working with them. If a friend of a squad member, however, joins the squad, the cooperation points between him and the squad member will be accumulated to the squad points thus leveling up the squad. It is therefore very important to play the game with good friends if you want to make the best of the game.\n\nYou can choose between 7 different squad types spread over two teams. Each squad has its own unique uniforms, abilities and special weapons. Usually, there is a:\n- long range specialist (sniper, rifleman, etc.) on each squad\n- machine gunner of some sort (or submachine gunner for the assault squads)\n- grenadier specialized for close combat and trench clearing.\nThere is always a squad leader. He has the same loadout options in every squad but can issue orders and call for different support depending on his squad type.\n\nThe only negative things I have to say about this game is\n- lack of support options (currently there is only gas, artillery and airsupport). Tank support or big NPC assault waves could be added as high level squad support intensifying the battles dramatically and really giving the player an idea of how it is to look at dozens of enemies charging towards his trench!\n- lack of customization options. Though the system is already quite customizable it could be even more customizable! E.g. enabling the player to choose his own weapons in stead of having three fixed weapon loadouts for each class.\n\nThat said, I think this game is one of the best WWI-games ever made! If you like intense FPS shooters or war games, or if you're just interested in history and WWI, I definitely recommend Verdun!\n\nMy rating: 10/10 points.","May 15, 2015","true","81.3"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","27","31","2","0"

Only paid 4 euros for it, and trust me, I just feel like I should have paid more for supporting the devs. This is a nice tactical shooter that won't work without cooperation and teamwork (kinda the same thing). If you're a CoD fanboy and you're expecting 360 noscopes and Doritos and Mountain Dew as rewards then go away, this is for serious gamers.\nA very nice experience, I can't even get bored of it even if I try. There are currenly 2 game modes, Frontline wich is the classic, and realistic trench warfare in WW1 and Deathmatch, where everybody's going crazy, you have to hide and wait for the perfect chance. This is in BETA so expect some hackers, glitches (not many) and some bad visuals.\nAs many people already said in their reviews, this looks and plays like Red Orchestra 2 or Rising Storm (games I own too, so I can confirm this theory). But, RO2 was free last year on steam for 1 day, so many trolls and fanboys got into it. Still, this is not a RO2 copy, it reflects more teamwork based gameplay and WW1 realism than you think.There are people who actually know what teamwork trully is, and you can play with them right here. Man, I love this game! The developers are active and they read almost every thread on the community. They listen to us and they are trying to fix the issues and problems we encounter in-game. There are constant updates wich I love! They are the perfect example of what every developer should act like.\nI'll give this game a strong 9.7/10. Developers you did a great job.

What I was expecting was a call of duty set in the trenches of WW1. What I have been playing (pretty much non-stop since i bought it!) was a highly squad-based, realistic, and addictive historical FPS. It really does capture the essence of the chaos in the trenches as well as the futility you will eventually feel every time you go over the top to charge the enemy trench. Charging at machine guns, rifles, and artillery fire to gain just a few metres of ground is a very different experience than any other game I've ever played. Anyways my pros and cons are:\n\nPros\n-Realistic maps, weapons, and shooting (no twitch fire, quickscoping, etc.)\n-Great squad play, if you do not play as a team player, you will die. Again. And. Again.\n-Sense of satisfaction from capturing the next trench and line and desperation as you start to lose it in the counter-attack\n\nCons\n-Maps are a bit too big for the team sizes, sometimes it feels as though there aren't enough people attacking or defending. This could be remedied with larger team sizes obviously, or NPC's.\n-Very odd squad progression system that sometimes carries on through matches and sometimes doesn;t, this is annoying especially when my mates and I are trying to get to the next level of uniform and upgrades.\n\nOverall this is a very well made game that is definetly worth its price. I hope to see future updates adding more great content!\n\n10/10\n","May 2, 2015","true","26.5"," 25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","89","25","28","5","0"

The main weapon that you use is  a bolt action rifle, so there is absolutely no spray and pray idiots. There are machine guns, but you can't sprint and move much slower when wielding one, also you have to deploy it like in RO. Each team has a few squads and each squad has very different members. Some have a sniper, an observer and a scout, and some squads have a grenadier (guy with grenades not launchers) a machine gunner and a rifleman. All squads have an officer. An officer can call in gas, mortars or observation planes depending on what type of squad he is in.\nThe maps deeply compliment the class system by having (hint WWI): trenches and barbed wire. The maps have several sets of trenches with fairly open stretches of land in-between, and when you are on the offense it is your job to charge across that land, from crater to crater and over the final hump into the enemy trenches. That gets challenging sometimes, but by coordinating attacks with your team you can successfully storm a fortified trench fairly easily.\nAs a defender your job its to stop the enemy from capturing your trench. As you sit behind some cover with only your rifle and head poking out you are a fairly hard target to reach and you pick off attackers as they charge at you. But then you are gassed and you can't see, or a mortar hits you and your corpse goes flying, or a teammate says: BREACH LEFT and you look to your left to see an enemy rifle pointed down the trench line at your head, and sometimes simply you are sniped from a guy in the trenches the enemy just captured.\nI have been in a few games with the devs even! They are kind and open to any feedback, positve or negative.\nOverall 11/10 would recommend.","October 2, 2014","true","164.1"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","23","25","0","0"

It's harsh, gritty and unforgiving, and you will die a lot.\n\nYou'll get blown up by artillery, just as you've finally managed to sneak through no-man's land while dodging the MG bullets flying over your head. You will choke on mustard gas, and you will get your head bashed in by a sneaky german NCO who's crept up behind you and is now pistol whipping you with his luger. You will hear the clink-clank of a grenade landing between your feet half a second before you're blown to bits. You will freak out as you miss your first shot with your slow-as-♥♥♥♥ bolt action rifle, while some crazy canadian is charging you with a god damn club. You will slam your mouse down on your desk repeatedly while screaming profanities as you get stuck in barbed wire for the second time in one round, but hopefully you've got a sturdy gaming mouse that is suited for that kind of abuse.\n\nAt it's best, Verdun is a really intense and immersive experience. The trench warfare setting is something you'll either love or hate, and makes it a bit different from other shooters that are usually set in more urban environments. It's highly recommended to play this game with friends, as the squad aspect is really important, and cooperation is the key to being successful. You will also gain co-op xp with the people you play with, which gives your squad improved perks and abilities.\n\nThis game is great fun if you enjoy historically themed FPS-games and bolt-action rifles. The learning curve is steep, but don't be discouraged. It is recommended that you read the official guides on steam before entering the game, just to understand more of what's happening.\n","May 4, 2015","true","155.2"," 24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","89","24","27","6","0"

As soon as I had left the game out of frustration with the bugs, a patch came through. I hopped back on and all the huge issues I had before were gone - hit detection and low latency and no server latency.. and no random invisible god mode!!!\n\nSo now that these issues were fixed so quickly, I am optimistic this is going to be a great game. I loved the WW1 HL1 mod 'The Trenches' but not enough servers were ever around and not enough players. That was a long time ago so the greyness was really hard to stand with HL1 engine. But Verdun is a great game and I suggest fans of shooters like the Red Orchestra series should check it out. It's not as hardcore as Red Orchestra but features are being added regularly. It's a pretty solid game so far with only a handful of maps. The maps are pretty great though, really capture the spirit of the first world war mud fest. I might suggest some fallen horses or donkeys or other animals as some form of cover. Not too much but a war horse or two fallen would look pretty cool.\n\nI ended up playing through the night since I was enjoying myself so much after the patch. Before, with players from all over the world on the EU or US servers, it was almost impossible to hit people with the lag/latency, but now with the patch I can hit people fine. Also there is a Japan server for people in SE asia such as myself so this is great. We just need an iinet or similar Australian server to complete the region mix I think. But I get decent pings on the Japan servers.","February 4, 2014","true","22.7"," 45 of 64 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","45","64","0","0"

I've been playing Verdun since the early access in October 2013. I have to say the game has indeed come a long way. Verdun has alot to offer, considering it is one of the only WWI games out there. I have really enjoyed going through unlocking new rifles and other weapons. It also gives you a chance to learn what weapons the soldiers used back then. Verdun has a tactical squad system which is effective, as you can play with your friends in a four-man squad. The way the game works is clever too. You and your team have to defend your trench and attempt to push your enemy to there back trench line.\n\nThe only thing with Verdun is the performance. The game should be like peanuts to run, however I struggle to run even with a high end PC build. The only thing the devs should work on now (in my opinion) is the optimization of the game.","April 17, 2015","true","155.3"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","20","21","0","1"

The graphics are breathtaking despite my PC's shortcomings. Verdun has a great unlock system that is easy to pick up and utilize with classes and a plethora of WW1 weaponry. The controls are intuitive if you've ever played an FPS and the gameplay is a thrill.

Various additions to the game are also in the works including a new melee system, and other, highly anticipated map releases.  Although this game is not finished - with it being in Early Access - through having slight bugs or glitches, I can safely say this game is going to be a huge success with the steam community, and if you are thinking of buying the game, know you are going to jump right in with a dedicated and reassuring community fighting it out in the muddy depths of World War one.  9/10.","October 31, 2014","true","71.0"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","19","21","0","0"

Like many other people were already saying before me it captures that "battlefeel" in such stunning ways that it makes you feel like being right there at the front with you fellow buddies in the mud. The controls are just perfect, the ambiance is awesome. It is NOT a campers feast or a sniper orgy as I was first afraid of, the trenches and the many craters in the battlefield will work to your advantage keeping your head down while you approach the enemies trenches (or run away from them haha).  The level-up mechanism is very motivating, it doesn't take too long to unlock the different weapons that each class comes with and they are all very well balanced. As already mentioned the controls are superb and put you right in the soldiers boots without any weird clunky mechanics to getting used to. The weapon handling is great and feels very realistic.\n\nI play it alone but the way the game is build most of the times you end up fighting with some people out of your squad side on side which makes it a very team oriented experience.\n\nThe graphics look super nice and I was very surprised to find out it was Unity Engine, I thought it was unreal 4 engine the first time I played. Keep in mind though that the game is done by just a handful of people so they don't have the resources to add tons of stuff nonstop but every patch I have seen so far added good features that made lots of sense. It says I only played 15,6 hours but that can't be true I played much more then that.\n\nDid I forget anything? I hope this game has a long future ahead of it with more and more people joining the battlefields and discovering how much fun it is. I hope the dev team will support this game for a long time too and keep adding maps and awesome events such as the Christmas truce.  Long story short: do your self a favor and buy this marvel of an indie game. One of the most motivating shooters I played in years without a doubt.","December 22, 2014","true","45.1"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","19","21","2","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SimpleWut/recommended/242860/","SimpleWut","Simple #DieBellies","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SimpleWut/","133 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI first found out about this game thanks to FRANKIEonPCin1080p, and thought I just have to buy it. I searched for it, and bought it for a really cheap price and loved it, my only problems with it are the glitches that are still around after 1 year of being in alpha, however those can be fixed pretty easily if they already know about them. Oh, and the really bad optimization of this game really sucks.. I run it at around 50FPS on ULTRA however, I cannot use Post-Processing or any of those other tick boxes without getting 15FPS, and I currently have a really good setup: 17 4770k 3.5GHz, 8GB DDR3 2144MHz & Palit GeForce GTX 770 4GB.. Anyway this isn't for me to show off my PC specs, it's a review on this game.\n\nDay 1:\nAfter spending 1hr and 37 minutes downloading this game, it was finally time to boot it up, so I rallied up some friends to take into the trenches with me to fight along side in this very well made WW1 trench warfare game. I found out we could make a squad to play easier, so away we go with our own squad, I also found out later on how the squad leveling works, which I actually find really stupid how it works, as once you quit the game you cannot join your squad back it seems :( but apparently as long as there is someone in that squad it will keep leveling, so once you make it you cannot join it back unless you randomly find it..\n\nDay 2:\nAfter the mass amount of killing I did on Day 1, I decided to go onto it again and this time try out the snipers, found out on Day 1 that there was bullet travel in this game, which is really good.. However this game has really awkward bullet travel time, and I am saying this from a mass FPS game where they also have bullet travel time.. But this game you have to aim far too far infront of you opponent while they are running to make the shot even connect :S Once I finally got the bullet travel time sort of sorted, I began to realise that sniping is really good, and seems to be fairly easy (Coming from a ranged user on all FPS games). The only issue I have with sniping is the mouse sensitivity.. You can only turn down your aim sensitivity which affects all of your aim down sight, so for the snipers I find it best to use a very slow sensitivity on this game, as it enables you to slowly move onto your targets, however you cannot have a set slider to adjust for using snipers, or for just using rifles/MGs which I found really annoying :(\n\nDay 3:\nAfter getting over the fact that you can only adjust one slider for your sensitivity I found a few bugs, which may have only happened to me, I am not too sure :o 1) Do you all remember the "Windows has stopped responding" error which occured on Windows XP the most? Well, now I find that in this game (But nothing stops responding) what I mean by this is, when I look up into the sky, at a set point my weapon starts to do that motion sort of them (When you dragged that error box around the screen a lot) I kept doing this because I wanted to see if it was actually a bug and not just a 1 off problem.. It happened each time. I then found that if I look up into the sky with a gas mask on, my screen goes completely white and really does hurt my eyes, so I kept doing it again to see if it's a 1 off bug.. It happened every time sadly.\n\nDay 4:\nI finally found some really funny people to talk to in the server! It also had some massive ♥♥♥♥♥ who were telling everyone who has a problem to delete the game, and gtfo those guys were real ♥♥♥♥♥ who should gtfo PC. But, I am basically saying is this game has a pretty nice small community which should start to grow a lot faster now that more people know about this game, and have actually seen some good footage of it (Thanks to FRANKIE).\n\nConclusion:\nEven though this game has a few little bugs, and a few little keyboard warriors on it.. You should still get this game! I got it for around £5 1 week ago so 17th December 2014, and you can too if you use the right website.. But it's on sale now so if you don't know that site, then just buy it from steam while it's on sale! It is a very good game, and I cannot suggest any other WW1 type of FPS I have ever played that was a fun and enjoyable as this.\n\nIf you read all of this review and didn't just skip to the conclusion, then I thank you for your time. I am not very good at writing reviews so this was kind of my first propper one on a game, but I hope it helped out :)","December 24, 2014","true","5.3"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","22","27","0","1"

The simple idea of assaulting over no man’s land and trying to capture a trench in a certain time period, before either gaining a foothold or having to fall back to defend really forces the player to advance or defend if you want your team to win. Some people do camp in the trenches when you attack but this can be beneficial to provide covering fire to your team.\n\nTo summarise; I like history, I bought this game, I like this game!\n\n10/10 would bayonet an enemy officer after accidently smashing keyboard!","January 18, 2015","true","27.6"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","90","18","20","7","0"

I'm going from trench warfare in the skies with airships, to WW1 trench warefare in either mud, or actually pretty scenic forests.\n\nBut yea, it's basically squad based WW1 trench warfare, where the squad you're in plays a major factor.  Depending on which squad type you're in, the CO of the squad can spawn people, or anyone could spawn people - provided the enemy is not right ontop of you.  You have guns locked away, but they're pretty easy to fully unlock everything.\n\nGoal is to capture the enemy trench, hold off their attack, and it alternates between attack rounds, where you have to get across sometimes small, sometimes hugh "no man's land" to get to the enemy trench. once you have numerical superiority, you'll start to cap.  And defence rounds, where you pretty much snipe, machine gun, or just shoot the other side as they make their way across noman's land.  about 5 minutes each, with potential "foothold overtime"s where at least someone is in the trench.\n\nMatches last about half an hour before mapchange, although it could be over sooner.

But it was only  Up untill recently that i was Killing my self for not buying it! because My mate did it for me!\nSpecial thanks to RG | ConolaCoil (name may change), Your a real Goons mate! Anyway, the game. Verdun is the single most Acurate WWI FPS iv ever seen. Its actualy Quite scary, how close it gets to the real Horrors that they had to face for us, them soldiers XD.\nOne can easely get Completely and Fully imersed in this game. Things like Being able to say things in game like little comands & Misc' frazes like a battle Cry (wich depending on what side your on will determin what could be said) & Laughing, or just saying "good Shot, Mate!" or "I cant Believe ya Hit that!" in a young British dudes exited Voice. the game just makes you smile at those points\nbut when your teammate Blows that Defening Wistle to sound the charge, You pray and Run like they taught you to in boot camp, strieght at the enimy with tiers of fury in your eyes! Guns blazing, its gonna ither be You or them.\n\nOnce you get the game, Even the Main menu is Awsomely cute and Acuarate. Your Menu sits floating with a Background of the Trenches were you have been spending the Nights of your Service. Music from the radio floats from the right, and the crackling fire and murmering sets the mood. its realy interactive and special, like when you go to the Options, it takes you to a small Dugout roomwere what seems like Your Personal items are. Its realy cool!\nto get straight into the action, dead in the middle of the top bar is "find battle". Smash that one with your Mouse, and you can pick out of Death match, just Unrealistic cod like DM, and Front line, Awsome staged battles that Use Squads and souch. you Press front line and it will bring you to a map layed out on the table in your Home trench. Find battles in one of there famous locations like Flanders. Once you've done that, You have to join A squad. Each squad has its Own name, made by people who have created them. You join one, and Play a roll for that squad in a battle. You join the battle, and Diferant individual squads are on ither team. your orders dont get mixed up with theres, however the Over all goal effects all in the team (Take Ground and Prosper!). You can even go through Tiers of Classes, giving you something to play for in your time in service. each Class has 3 tiers and once unlocked, the tiers loadout is avalable 24/7. the tiers will introduce items relevent to the class, aka a grenedier will be upgraded with a Pistol of some sort and more Grenades, to get closer faster and LOB em in! a dangerous job. and rifleman can upgrade with Bayonet's and scopes, making Trench warefare as scary as Peeking your head over the trench lines.\nEverything about this game i love! even the guns have souch attention to detail, and realism is beond messure here. you dont always ♥♥♥♥ the Bolt on your rifle ither, like Automaticly in cod. you dont auto reload, everythings up to the player, like how it was in WWI. the Guns themselfs are Works of Art, looking Beautifuly realistic and sounding like it too. and its the same with the landscapes! The Trenches themselfs have steps were peopel would peak over and fire, little alcoves were people would take cover, barbed wire everywere inwich you can get stuck, and with A lot of movement tear yourself open and DIe! its all wonderfull!\nI happened to be more patiant when it comes to games for some reson, but i would think that Those who are used to cod may not Like this as much mainly because if you try some stuff that you can do in cod in this, well it normaly doesnt work and will ruin the game for you.\nso basicaly, if you want an awsome game to do with WWI thats attention to detail is Beond measure, Grab this. if your not, grab cod 1.\n","February 28, 2015","true","35.0"," 24 of 31 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","24","31","3","3"

Verdun is a WW1 history buff's wet dream as long as they love online multiplayer, a great community that is full of philosophical history buffs and awesome trolls, and first person shooters. It updates from time to time like minecraft. You fight on 5 maps so far; can play as the French, Germans, Canadians, and British. It is mainly a squad based game that requires the strategy and cooperation of your teammates ranging up to games that can maximize to 32 people per server. It requires a lot of patience because it is a long paced game since it tries and succeeds in creating a WW1 atmosphere. You can unlock different weapons as you level up your different squad classes. I argue however, that the squad-class rank-ups are too easy now; you can now rank up all 4 tires in one match if you do well enough while as before it used to take way longer which balanced out the game and formed as a prestiege mode for your progression. Other than that, it is a great game, definantly one of my top-favorites especially out of my steam library. Just know that back then there were mostly bolt-action rifles without scopes, so don't expect so many mobile machine guns in this game. Have fun and enjoy it, the game's price increases the more it updates so hurry up and get it while you still can!","November 2, 2014","true","124.3"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","0"

Basically it's Red Orcestra of WWI. It's hard to do a WWI game well and these guys have. I like the squad system, its something I would like to see in other games. I like the trench warfare and I can't wait to see what else these guys have in mind. I'd like to see tanks and planes come into it. Also, as an Australian I'd really like to see a Gallipoli/ANZAC DLC. Would also like to add that Gas brings in something very unique as well - never seen it in another game.\nThis game can pretty much do the entire scope of WWI and it's brilliant. A few things I found a little annoying is that the movement feels a little clunky and the hit registration is a little off. Wish they had more maps as doing the current ones can get a little grindy and repetitive sometimes.\n\nIn conclusion this game is a very good realistic historical FPS game and I highly recommend it! 7/10","May 10, 2015","true","36.9"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","14","14","0","0"

It's kind've funny though.\n-The community has been sort've notably infiltrated by the CoD and Battlefield community; you can spot them by their endless whining in the chat.\n-Getting good at the game will require you to die at the start of your career. A lot. You'll get better at it with the more time you put into learning the gameplay. Most people tend to give up within the first ten ranks. If you're easily discouraged or prone to breaking blood vessels from high blood pressure, I don't recommend getting this game.\n\nIf you're a history buff or have an appreciation for well-made World War games, get it.

Tons of new weapons, even more factions, coop wave mode, realistic gore, and my favorite thing, the death rattles and somber wails of your enemies and comrades when killed by gas, bullets, arty, barbed wire, burned alive or simply beaten to ♥♥♥♥ with a shovel or club. This game continues to push the hellish and brutal atmosphere of The Great War.\nWhile optimaztion and performance has increased for me slightly (90fps avg Ultra/High @ 1440p) it does drop to 55fps in heavily crowded areas with gas and arty strikes landing but overall feels smoother. (Mileage varies) Overall I still reccomend this game heavily to anyone who adores playing this style of game alone or with friends!\n\n(Original Review)\nThe game places you in some of the bloodiest and gruesome battlefields that WW1 ever had... An does so in such beautiful and engaging way it makes your heart pound.\n\nPushing forward trenches with your teammates and friends, frightened that a bomb will land beside you and take your squad out while also dodging rifle and machine gun fire, grenades, and artilery as you push onwards to take your position in the frontlines all the while your NCO's drop artilery and gas on the enemy. If you are lucky enough to get into the forward trenches you fight without mercy in close quarter combat using pistols, grenades, bayonets, shovels and whatever else you may have at your disposal until you either take over the trench or forced to retreat licking your wounds until next time.\n\nOnce you gain the trench or fall back you are now in charge of holding what you have with all you got. You dig in and get ready as artilery shells pound steadily across the battlefield an enemy soliders push your postion, as gas drops in your trench you frantically put your gas mask on and wait hoping to see the enemy pushing through the gas and explosions and kill them before you are killed yourself.\n\nThis game is not for the arcade fps game fans, but would def recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good realistic fps game with frantic combat and smooth gameplay. Worth the full asking price or steam sale prices. Will not be disappointed.\n\nFor those who didnt have the pleasure of owning the game back 2013, this is what you missed during the christmas time!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K1XpgavJ5w","June 18, 2015","true","140.0"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","13","14","0","0"

More on that later on.\nThis makes gameplay feel much more about skill, since that one shot counts a lot more. Can't spray and pray with a bolt action rifle!\nYou'll see machine gunners try and surpress rather than go for a lot of kills.\nIf you die a lot whilst playing, remember to check your cover. Since it's trench warfare, what you see directly in front of you isn't all that can see you. ;) Make sure your flanks are secured, hide next to some obstacles so that any threat is within your field of vision.\nThe unlock system has been overhauled from what it was in early access.\nIt is now a system that makes much more sense, you can easily unlock just the weapons for just the classes that you like, no wasted unlocks or anything. Those points you gain by leveling go straight to what you want!\nPlaying with randoms still gives the classic problems of little teamwork, but the linearity of the maps and the objectives on it force everyone to go one way anyway. Which fits the theme.\nOne game where linearity isn't an issue! :)\n\nWithout discussing price, I recommend this game if you're looking for a less-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t shooter.","June 22, 2015","true","22.2"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","14","16","2","0"

It is set in WWI Western Front, Battle of Verdun, which was fought between Germans and French. Gunplay, maps and overall gameplay feels a lot like Red Orchestra 2/Rising Storm so if you've liked that game you will love Verdun too.\nGunplay feels verysmooth, and realistic. For now in 120 beta there are a lot of bolt actions with bayonets and scopes which you can unlock. Pistols and Machineg guns are present, but I prefer playing frontline soldier with simple boldtaction to kill my enemies.\nThe pace of the game is a bit so so dont expect to get 40+ kills every game, but i think this is a good thing.\nThe thing i love about this game is the realistic gamemode which is consiting of defending a trench and then after some time counter attacking the enemy. If sucessful in capturing the trench from enemy you have to defend it fromeneies counter attack. If not you fall back and defend the old position. Stalemates are common like they were in WWI.\nAnouther game mode that is rifle (bolt-action rifle) deathmatch free for all,this game mode is self explanotory.\nOverall the game is awesome and i would recommend it to all my friends to play it.","December 20, 2013","true","9.3"," 20 of 27 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","20","27","0","0"

The biggest challenge is me."\n\nVerdun is a realstic WW1 FPS with its strengths being in it's squad - role based gameplay, and historical representation (the maps are realistic for the period, as are the character , models, weapons, uniforms etc .)\n\nOne can really get immersed in the ebb and flow of the battles, the atmosphere, geography and heat of the battle.. And feel how tough and suicidal WW1 was.\n\nWith that in mind, the squad based gameplay allows a good breadth of available strategy and tactics that can be employed to successfully "gain ground"....but it does take team work, and thats what I really like.\n\nThe player objects are well represented, and have had undertaken, numerous tweaks, improvements and additions. There are period uniforms, and, as a squad progresses - uniforms get upgraded.\n\nWeapon usage and realism is pretty good too. There are aspects that can be improved  (like reloading animations, muzzle flash etc.) Overall, Im able to hit my target, if I take my time - and have good cover and support.\n\nThe graphics over all are excellent - quite a bit of work has been done by the dev's to smooth the performance vs quality.  Ultra settings still need to be improved - when turned on - performance is very "laggie". Graphic performance and quality on "High" is good enough though.\n\nThe sounds are also excellent, with period music, action sounds (explosions, gun fire etc),  and battlecries.\n\nThe game continues to be developed - the current version is 170 - I think it's pretty close to a final product - but the dev's aren't done yet!\n\nIt's not an easy game to get started out on for everyone, but other players will help you out if you are new, or you can head over to the Verdun War College and enrol.\n\nBetween 5-10 hours of gameplay is needed to become somewhat proficient  at Verdun :)\n\nVerdun is definately worth the money, and your dollars will help the WW1 era games to develop...they have been the poor cousin to WWII games.\n\nThe Verdun community is full of passionate, helpful and decent people. Wouldn't be a community without it's trolls too, of which, Verdun has it's fair share. There are numerous official and unofficial guides available to help you understand what's "under the hood" .\n\nEarly Access Score: 8/10","June 16, 2014","true","288.0"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","1"

This has a rank up system, and look forward to what more patches will bring, hopefully a graphics overhaul, it's not great now, but it's not bad.You always have to watch all your diretions in this game as the enemy could come from anywhere.

I liked it because this time in history is virtually non-existant in the gaming world.   Seeing this was a nice change of pace.\n\nThe best part about this game, is the community.  They are helpful, and unlike most FPS fanbases, they think.  When I was mulling over the idea of getting this game, I checked the reviews, like you are now.  What I saw a lot of was "you are gonna die a lot, but don't let that discourage you."  They were right, but I kept trucking along.  I got better, and it was fun; then everything changed down the road.\n\nWith the new updates coming out, Verdun fell into the trap that nearly every FPS fell into: Catering almost exclusivly to the marksman/sniper class.  I made a discussion about it on the community hub, and they told me just to keep practicing.     I did, but there were still some major problems.\n\nThe biggest problems facing this game and two things: 1) spawn system is a mess.   Too many times have I spawned only to IMMEDIATELY get a mortar thrown right on top of me and have my head blown out my backside.  2) As stated before, catering to the marksmen class.  In some maps, like Duramount for example, I REFUSE to play that map as the allies.  It is such a sniper's nest.  Your game play is literally nothing but spawn, die, spawn, die, spawn...die.  To test this, I had a friend watch me and time how long it took me to die when i respawned.  I didn't move forward, all I did was spawn and immediately crouch down, and then died.  My life time?  0.83 seconds....I WISH I was making that up.\n\nThis game has(had?) a lot of promise, but so far I am seeing a bunch of wasted potential.  The devs are working, but are they doing the right work?  This game needs a lot of polishing.  As it is now, I cannot recommend it, but I hope that will change.","May 3","false","26.6"," 68 of 115 people (59%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","59","68","115","10","9"

Although Verdun is simplistic with it's guns (it is WW1), the terrain and the way they organized the classes is what makes this game very peculiar.\n\nThe setting is WW1. The battlefront is eastern France. It's you and your squad trying to push the front lines. Well, only if you choose that game mode. Verdun boasts three game modes for the moment : front lines (where it's a defend/advance territory tactic), offensive in which your constantly pushing back defenders to take control of new areas and lastly, last stand where you and a few other players have to hold back hordes of opposing players. The guns themselves are simplistic and depending whether you're playing as an Entente soldier or Central powers soldier, will determine the type of guns you use. Some guns have more ammo than other guns but (speaking specifically about rifles) each gun is relatively the same. Each player is given a rifle and a pistol. The squad leader is stuck with a pistol and cannot holster a rifle. This player has binoculars instead. With this, the squad leader is able to tell the squad where to advance as well as launch mortar/artillery fire to his choosing. The class system is a little bit different in Verdun than other games. You are not actively allowed to jump from class to class as it may be occupied already by another player. This player has to accept your offer to switch classes. This is important as this game is highly based on team work. It is near impossible to advance or defend without the help of your team mates. Most of the guns offer a one-shot kill but head shots do count for extra points. Some classes even have some high powered machine guns if you rank up enough! I should also add there is a ranking system in place where after each match you will be given experience points to unlock further arsenals.\n\nThe maps/terrain are what really set apart this game from other shooters. You can't simply start running and gunning. Everything is a calculated move and no-mans land is really dangerous. You never know whose peaking from their trench waiting to pick you off. You can however, move slowly and try to remain undetected. Moving slowly and moving with squad mates really increase your chances of winning. Some action players may not like this "look-then-move" strategy but it's what really distinguishes the game. I'm a personal Halo fan and love the running-gunning-blowing up sort of stuff. This gives me a little break in that and also forces me to really work on my aim. It can be quite the thrill trying to advance and sneak behind enemy lines. Don't go too far though or you may be killed by the game for staying out of the playable area. All basic controls are here. WASD provides for basic movement while the mouse let's you point and shoot where you want. "G" throws a grenade (when you get one) while "V" is melee. I should add some grenades are gas grenades in which you will need to equip your mask to avoid further damage. A great feature in this game is the ability to crouch or prone when necessary. Space will stand you up or allow you to jump. Holding "shift" (or sprint) while aiming down your sights will make your player hold his breath for a better shot.\n\nThe graphics aren't too bad at this stage. Their up there but I think they could do a little better. I have a brother (whose really into WW1/WW2) also mentioned some of the trenches are way too clean. I understand the game has to look neat to a point but some realism would be appreciated. I wouldn't mind seeing mud being slapped up by a player as he's running, or even mud pits that can slow players down. The sounds are okay at the moment and aren't extremely immersive or over the top. The basic sounds are there but adding a few more things may take the player to another level. Hearing shots skimming over your head can't be beat.\n\nOverall, this game has some huge potential. I'll be keeping an eye on it to see where it goes. I'm hoping down the line they add a few more perks and add a few more options for players to play with. I know it's world war 1, but even adding a "radio" that let's you "report" enemy positions may be cool! Luckily, there is a system now in place that takes care of this.\n\n\n\nEARLY ACCESS RATING : 7/10\n\n\nGameplay	B	Story / Campaign	N/A	Visuals / User Interface	B-	Sounds / Music	B-	Replay-ability	B-	Overall 	B-\nScreenShots :\nGas mask equipped\n\nLaying down covering fire","February 16","true","39.2"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","12","13","2","0"

It's a frustrating game, in that you have to be really accurate in order to get kills. There is definitely an element of skill needed to play, but that's part of the fun. There is definitely an element of teamwork and co-op required also... which is where this game will shine for most players. COD Kiddies should find something else, because going rogue in this game gets you nothing but dead.\n\nAs of the release version at the time of posting this, there is a few nagging issues that you may need to keep an eye out for/be aware of..\n\n1) MG's can, and will find you... EVERY TIME. They are wildly accurate, powerful and annoying. Currently they are bugged in the fact that you can't hear them over long distances (aka "silent MG bug") and they are tough to spot.\n\n2) Luger is wildly accurate, seems to 2-3 hit kill over long distances (pulling off a headshot across the map with a luger isn't a tough task) but the stopping power up close is annoyingly lacking. If you can't manage to land a headshot when clearing trenches, you can and will most likely get rolled by a crackshot with their rifle. I think the luger needs a bump in damage but then so do all pistols in the game so far. A bump in damage, but nerf their long range accuracy and damage falloff.\n\n3) The Lee-Endfield/SMLE has a weird bug when using a scope on it that seems the scope isn't aligned properly. You need to aim slightly to the right of your target (if he stands still) to hit him. Ironsights on it are also bad. I'm not entirely sure of this is just one of those usual mid-dev bugs or if it was intentional, but just keep that in mind.\n\nAll in all it's a very well put together game, for a game with only 3 devs. I look forward to seeing what they do in the future with updates.\n\n\n\n","December 6, 2014","true","31.1"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","1"

The finished product, I think, speaks for itself. This game is, in this gamer's opinion, a finely-polished killing machine. From the painstakingly detailed period uniforms from several of the nations involved in the First World War, to the gleam of the mud in the filthy, blood-soaked trenches, this game is, simply put, beautiful. This isn't a case of some sub-contractors churning out a Call of Duty/Red Orchestra clone to make a few bucks. I believe these gentlemen perceived the absence of a quality FPS for the Great War and set their efforts to doing this over the past few years. This is quality. Considering the development team was so small it is simply amazing to me that this game is as great as it is but having played several times with the developers themselves grunting in the trenches with me, I think it is certain that this is the product of a labor of love. And their efforts have succeeded indeed. This has been my favorite FPS for the past year. There have been a few missteps along the way but the developers were always on the ball and fixed things with lightning speed. The community is definitely one of the top tier as well. If you are as fascinated by this historical period as I then I cannot recommend any other game more highly. My hat is off to you, sirs.

In the sense that when you think you have plenty of cover somehow your head is sticking out and you can be shot at? Either this is true or somehow shots can go through solid terrain and neither option is really great.\n-The retreat mechanic is very poorly implemented, you get very little time to get out of no man's land, its actually more worthwhile to stay behind and attempt to kill something before the inevitable doom and just turn your back and get shot like 99% of the times. This needs to re-designed for it punishes people that are actively trying to fufill the offensive objectives.\n-Gas seems more of a inconvenience then a terrifying weapon. You often find it being more useful as a smoke screen then  actually incapacitating soldiers like it actually did.\n-Maps have some really noticeable design flaws. That lead to problems of gameplay. Specially on the loser side, the further you are pushed to the back the more unlikely it becomes for you to be able to make a comeback has the reserve and communication trenches are often devoid of cover or depth. Often even resulting in predictable spawn killings.\n-barbed wire is counter intuitive and in some cases too effective in channeling players into killing zones.\n-Legions of bugs, seriously guys, you shouldn't have launched it as is.\n\nConclusions:\n-I can't reccomend it based on the fact that is so bug ridden and bare bones in many aspects. Although i love what they are trying to do and the vision is very interesting and compelling with a heavy heart i have to say this isn't up to snuff. It needs a hell lot more polish and work before i can really say it is a game worth buying. If things get better over time i might change it to a positive review, but atm it is too rough around the edges.\n\nNote to the devs:\n\nSeriously work harder guys, i really want to give this a positive score and reccomend it, it's up to you.","May 20, 2015","false","22.6"," 190 of 342 people (56%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","56","190","342","19","19"

However for the most part is is a very good first-person shooter. If you are looking for a good WWI FPS, this is it. Though it is not simulater quality, it is still a very stimulating and enjoyable game.\n\nSecond, this game hostess a higher quality of gamers. So for the most part you don't have 13 year old kids telling others to "Get rekt" or swear every chance they get. Every now and then there will be one or two of those people, wich is unavoidable. However there is a mute option but it is not like other games and may take some time to figure out. Though I'm sure if you ask in-game there will be people to help.\n\nThird, this game does include clans such as 'KK', 'BW' and '+', and elite players. '+Zab' is one you may hear a lot about.\n\nFinaly, at times it can be enjoyable, agrovating or however you want to put it. Overall it is one of the best WWI FPS games you can get.","February 26, 2015","true","513.2"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

It's frenetic, in your face, brutal, compelling, sounds amazing and genuinely makes me feel like my ♥♥♥ is on the line..  I'm a long time Battlefield 1942 / Vietnam player with the occasional Modern Warfare mod from years ago.. years of early Counter Strike AWP'ing around..  I played Battlefield 4 multiplayer very briefly and went back to Battlefield P4F - Call of Duty Advanced Warfare got all of 45 minutes before I said 'what is this cr*p' and went back to finding something interesting which is where I came across Chivalry Medieval Warfare and thoroughly enjoyed the 'oh.. he's going to hurt me' gritty close range fighting but always felt it a bit cliched, with Verdun it's got the intensity of Chivalry without the moment to look each other over.. if you stare into someones eyes in Verdun one of you is going to die and that happens a lot.\n\nThe maps?  Glorious.. some are wide and expansive rolling fields of carnage, some are watery graves of face crawling, all with layer upon layer of attack and riposte.\n\nMy only frustration is people seem to not acknowledge the game for what it is - a rolling to and fro of attack and defence - this means as the attack phase timer ticks down, 5 or 10 team mates will be laying prone, meters from the enemy trench seemingly frozen in space and time..  if the timer ticks out and you haven't got the trench, you loose your attack wave (and eventually the game)..  the historical trauma of WWI was the obscene body count due to hurling massive numbers against each other ..  as this is a WWI game, sitting on your ♥♥♥ meters from the objective does nothing except frustrate your team mates and amuse your enemy.  Get with the program - Take the trenches (and die trying).\n\nIt might be a worthwhile feature to have a 'ground covered / advanced' counter so everyone could see who was covering the most forward ground and potentially, that NCO's could execute those who refuse to attack.  You want to hide in a trench and not go forward when the whistle blows?

It is different from most first person shooters in that it is highly cooperative on each of the sides.  Individuals must join a squad which is comprised of four people each of which have different roles within the squad.  If success is to be had, it comes as being a member of a squad, and not just one of many soloists as is commonplace in most other first person shooters.  This not only gives it a unique flavor, but also gives it a strong feeling of what it was like to be fighting in World War One.  To my knowledge, this is the only World War One first person shooter ever to exist.  Other than a few flight simulators, there have been practically no games on the subject of World War One at all.\n\nMy Grandfather was a veteran of the "Great War" which is what it was called up until the conclusion of World War Two.  He was an officer in a tank battalion and commanded a young tanker who would eventually become famous as a World War Two hero, tanker, and general: George Patton.\n\nI highly recommend this game.  The authors are continuously updating it, sometimes as frequently as several times a day, but never less than a couple times a week.  They are dedicated to creating a great game, and thus far they have succeeded fantastically.  This game is worth every penny even in this stage of beta, and I'm sure that when it reaches its final release version, it will rank up there with the best first person shooters of all time.  Count yourself lucky by shelling out some cash, and becoming an early release beta tester of this wonderful new game.

The game takes its title from the most infamous battle of World War I and its prodominate feature is its historically accurate weapons, uniforms, and battlefields. Players will work in 4 man specialized squads on either the Entente or Central powers' side. Gameplay involves defending your trench and attacking theirs within an alotted time. This is more fun than it sounds at first, as your whole team will need to work together and communicate to capture the enemy line. Obsticles include enemy gas and mortars, machine gun fire, rifle fire, grenades, barbed wire, sandbags, trench works, shellholes, old vehicles, dead horses, and more.\n\nThis is definately a game for those who are history buffs, FPS fanatics, or looking to die a whole lot. Not for the easily frusterated. Weapons (especially rifles) will present a slight learning curve because of the bullet drop and physics of WWI-era weapons. The news and game updates are constant and the team is highly dedicated. Devs often play matches and converse with the players.\n\nPros:\n- Fun and Addicting Gameplay\n- Historically accurate weapons, uniforms, and maps\n- Devoted Developers\n- Great Community (League/Tournament + Plenty of Clans)\n- Multiple Servers which are usually populated decently\n\nCons:\n- Bugs and glitches here and there (Devs will fix major ones asap)\n- Slight learning curve for new players\n- You'll die a lot.

I know I have. Verdun, mon ami, is the answer. There's almost nothing I don't like about it. Let's get to the facts!\n\nPros?\n\nAwesome graphics, even on low settings. Over twenty weapons, all authentic, all from the war. The maps are fun and well-planned, and really immerse you in that Great War feeling. If you're afraid of being limited to bolt-action rifles and bayonets, then fear not! There's room for knives, machine guns, pistols, shovels, even submachine guns. You can mêlée with just about everything. For example, if you don't have a bayonet fixed on your rifle, you can strike with the stock. Heck, you can kill people with binoculars! The levelling system is great. Performance is good, and I've encountered very few bugs.\n\nCons?\n\nThe movement animations always get me... I mean, when you're running, your weapon just looks like it's bobbing off your chest! They need to look less robot and more human. The crawling animation isn't good. I'd like for there to be static HMGs, however the devs have said that this is a no-go.\n\nIn the end? An awesome game! Among the best games I've ever played... and it's in beta!

I was originally drawn to it for the subject matter, and despite its, at times, quirky aspects, such as somewhat crude character models and cartoonish animations, I found myself sticking with it.  The gameplay always drew me back, and I found myself devoting more and more of my limited gaming time to this intriguing game.\n\nSlowly, over more than a hundred builds(!), the developers changed one thing, then another and another, in a steady march to completion.  It hasn't always been a straight line to the finish - sometimes two steps forward, one step back - but these guys perservered, and succeeded, in ways both surprising and impressive.\n\nWhat started out as a clever, quaint little Indie game, fun in its own right, has blossomed into something much different.  The talented minds behind this effort could have stopped trying to improve things long ago, and still have it be considered a success.  Instead, through relentless hard work and obvious devotion, they have produced what, to me, is the best looking, most immersive, fun (and intense)  multiplayer FPS I've ever had the pleasure to play.  From the choice of a graphics engine to attention to gameplay elements, they've managed to do what virtually everybody said couldn't be done - create a compelling FPS based on the First World War.  Graphically, this is hands down the most gorgeous game I've ever played, of any genre.  Fantastic artwork, gentlemen!  You've put the big-budget boys to shame!\n\n\nThere may still be some elements that are less than perfect, but it has been a real pleasure to follow the development of the game through beta to release, and I suspect that development will continue.  If you like multiplayer FPS games, you owe it to yourself to try this absolutely stunning effort.  I highly recommend it (as if that was in doubt)!\n\nThanks to the devs for bringing this game to life.  Thank you, thank you.  I only wish I had the time and the stamina to play it more!","May 2, 2015","true","386.3"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

However, this isn't World War II but the Great War of 1914-18.\nSee the harsh and violent war right at your finger tips. This game gives a glipse into the hell of Trench Warfare as you play the soldiers of the Central Power Germany against the Entante forces of Great Britian, Canada and France. (Soon the United States)\n\nVerdun uses a squad base system with each squad having it's own unique weapons and classes to fill with seperate abilities to use to help claim victory.\n\nThere are three game modes to choose from but only the main Trench Games are where you're going to find people playing with 16 on 16 battles. 32 players slugging it out in the trenches. (I wish for maybe 32 on 32 but not a real complaint)\n\nThe enemy charging your trench is the least of your worries as gas attacks, recon planes, mortars and bombardments can rain down on you at anytime. Once you repeal the enemy charge, it's now your turn to charge in the Counter-Attack. Beware though, you can lose your head to a sniper and machine gun fire.\n\nI am glad to see a game that covers over the Great War as it's often looked over for World War II. The game is a blast but it does have it's own share of problems in my opinion.\n\nThe boundaries can often get annoying as you are executed for sticking your pinky toe in the red for too long or when an attack fails, you have so many seconds to retreat back to your trench before you are executed for desertion, so it doesn't allow you to stick around to slow down the enemy's counter attack.\n\nGames are often one sided with the game asking people to switch sides. It's counter to this is putting a penalty on the outnumbering side to prolong their respawn. From what I see is there is no voting system in place to allow you to vote someone out of your squad. For example, my friends and I often play in the same squad but on occasion, one of us suffer a disconnection from the server. A new player will join the game and take our friend's spot. You can ask him to leave the squad but you often told "No." You can't vote him out of the squad now and your friend is out of luck again.\n\n\nWhat I'd like for the developers to add in and I know this is primarily done over the Western Front but I'd like something to show the Eastern and Southern Fronts of the war.\n\nThe snowy mountain battles in the Carpathians between the Germans and Austrians against the Russians.\nThe German Push against the Russians in Poland and Lithuania.\nThe Urban Battles in Serbia and Poland.\nThe Gallipoli landings of the Entante against the Ottomans.\nSo much more.\n\nThe game is a solid enjoyment for History lovers and shooter fans. I highly recommend it.","October 5, 2015","true","41.6"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","1"

Even though my computer is pretty bad at the moment, i can handle this game without losing pleasure at the game itself.\nThe graphic are not high quality but then again remember: My computer is pretty bad and it's still early acces. I would stay neutral at this point because i'm not in the position to judge over the graphic with a computer like this.\n\nThe feeling of sitting in a trench...just waiting for the enemy to run into your gun is amazingly caught! Before i forget there are Squads (4 people working together...reminds me of L4D but don't mind that, it was basicly it in WW1). Imagine you are in the defense move of your newly captured trench line. 4 Squads are holding the position. But if one Squad is whiped out during the defense...you are at risk of getting flanked, so you have to look up your map more often to avoid that risk, to reinforce weakend sites of your trench.\nThe WW1 feeling is once more amazingly caught by the gameplay itself. If you get shot, it's over pretty much 90% of the time. You need to be careful if you advance to the enemy trench, if the enemy sees you and you are not fast enough, it's over. Even if you can't see the enemy... there could still be someone targeting you, a world war 1 feeling greatly captured. And if there's a short time of silence in the battlefield... be aware! Somebody could be aiming at your head.\nAll in all to not make this too long, Verdun is a great WW1 shooter. WW1 shooter are seen rarely and if there is one game like this, it does not capture the trench warfare, gas warfare and the psychotic warfare as nearly as Verdun!\n\nPROS\n\n- Great feeling when playing the game (doesn't matter whether it's the Entente cordiale or the "Axis"\n- Greatly capture of the units sended into the war back in the time.\n- Sounds are quite noticble\n- Great capture of the trench warfare and the combined gas warfare\n- historicly correct battlefields, weapons and looks of the units\n- nice rank up system\n- World War 1 shooter\n- Balanced gameplay (Outcome depends on the players)\n\nNeutral\n\n- Graphic which i can't judge about\n\nCONS\n\n- pretty empty servers\n- can be frustrating (if your hard work, to get to the enemy trench line is destroyed by one shot but then again... WW1)\n- Ranking up can be pretty hard if you have a skilled enemy team\n\n\nI hope i could help you people out there a little bit with the decision to buy Verdun or not.\n\nGreetings","January 6, 2015","true","55.9"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

It starts out difficult, absolutely, and a lot of the bad reviews you see are there for two reasons:\n\n1) They only played a few maps, couldn't get over the learning curve in that amount of time, and quit\n\n2)They forgot it's EARLY ACCESS, yes, it has bugs, it says that in the pop up right when the game starts\n\nNow then, the learning curve can be extremely steep.  Expect to die, and expect to die often.  You will be killed on occasion the moment that you spawn due to spawning on the NCO into enemy fire or unlucky spawns into grenades/mortars/artillery fire/etc.\n\nThis game is about playing smart.  Going rambo/gung-ho as you would in CoD/Halo/etc rarely works.  You want to move up, use plentiful covering fire, watching for movement, and don't fire from the same place too many times.  If you stick it out and learn to play, and especially if you can find a good group to play with (feel free to add me, I'm happy to help new folks), then this game can be extremely rewarding.\n\nUpdates are fairly frequent, so the devs are hard at work.\n\nIt also has the buff of being a rather accurate WW1 game, which we know is uncommon compared to WWII.  So, give it a try, expect to die, and learn the game.  The community is pretty solid for the most part, and we're happy to help new players and answer their questions.\n\n10/10 - Would recommend if you have the patience to handle a learning curve and occasional bugs.","February 27, 2015","true","435.9"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","11","14","0","0"

Here is my initial thoughts after about 8 hours of straight game play.\n\nPros:\n- Decent comunity\n- Excellent "feel" to the game; it feels like you are on a WW I battlefield!\nGreat team based decision making. You can really have a blast when you meet up with your riends and join the same squad. Working together is what it's all about in this game.\n- works on modest computers\n- the back and forth feel of battles is great. Capture a trench, defend it, and move on to the next trench, repeat.\n- Great assortment of weapons and squad types. I think most players will find what they are good at ater a short while. PLeanty of diversity\n- Fast pace to a game. Although you die pretty quick, the wait times for respawning are short and pretty interesting really (such as re-spawning on your NCO, etc.)\n\nCons:\n\n-Needs a solo campaign. Also, should have nots to fill in for missing players. As it is currently, there is no solo campaign and NO bots at all. Completely a multi-player game. Not a real bad thing, but I would like to be able to practice and learn the maps better. Solo play would work best for this. True, you can enter an empty server and do the same thing.\n- Hard to tell friend from enemy.\n\nOverall I really do like this game. It isn't for everyone of course.

Camping and tactical play play a major part in this game from a defensive perspective but when attacking you need to carefully plan your attacks and attack where the enemy is weak. Infiltrating an enemy trench and stealthily killing everyone there can never get boring with the added suspension of not knowing what is behind the next trench corner. The game rewards you working as a squad with the spawn mechanic where if the leader of the squad is deep behind enemy lines the squad players can spawn on him and help with the capturing of the trench. The game also has a one shot kill mechanic for rifles where the best marksman will be the one to get the kill to add further suspense.

Muddy trenches, muddy nomansland, muddy everything. Artillery shells falling, gas floating into your shellhole, Rifles crack from all over, the occasional sound of a lewis gun firing rattles in your ears. The atmosphere is amazing, although sometimes maps are lacking players. There are several maps, each based on a different section of line on the western front. From Flanders, the muddy, stalemate of a map, to the Aisne, a rather unscathed piece of battlefield with trees growing and pretty foliage (lots of hiding spots). The mechanics are great (with the exception of one) and amazing for a world war one game. THIS IS NOT A GENERIC SHOOTER. The ballistics are probably unlike anything you've seen, and the change from assault rifles to your bolt action enfields and lebels is an awesome change of pace in a game. The game focuses on attack and defend gameplay, and can sometimes result in very trench warfare-esque stalemates. There's a time limit to prevent too much of a boring stalemate though. You can level up and unlock new weapons for your classes, and pick from one of several squads from each side, such as Poilus, Landsers, Tommies, Alpenjager, etc.\nIf you play with the same squad members a few times you will earn squad xp earning you bonuses like better artillery, more points, and late war uniforms. The graphics are also amazing, especially for an indie game. THE ONE FLAW I have with this game is the melee. I think its pretty lacking for a world war one game where hand to hand combat was the norm. But this is a minor flaw, I just hope it gets improved down the road.\n\nAnd on that note my final praise. The devs started working on this sometime around 2006-7? And they finished the thing this long after? Thats a crazy feat for indie developers, and they have showed they will provide regular updates that are very good unlike many early access developers. That's all good, but even after the game has been released they have just now unveiled their plans for after the games release. A BUNCH of huge updates, FREE! Adding things like night maps, US squads, flamethrowers, gore, and more!\n\nAMAZING game!","April 27, 2015","true","56.3"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","7","7","3","0"

The game takes you to various locals and humongous maps spanning the length of France. I have long been an admirer of history, and I must say that this game has not disappointed me in keeping to the period.\nTo speak of the graphics, the game in it's earliest form was basic at the least. However, it has gone far from those nascent graphics and has blossomed into a grimy and bloody masterpiece of historical-based games. Gun models are very realistic and detailed, and include things such as serial numbers and maker's etchings for those that look closer than just the far sights. Uniforms, with the benefit of a scrupulous historical adviser and modeling team, are top notch and pleasant to the eye, as much as they are to the period. On top of these, much work has been done to detail every inch of maps with props and trenches that are again as if they were lifted right from the annals of time to be played by our more recent generation.\nGame play is formed to follow the manner of tactics used at the time, with the defending or assaulting of trenches, where the capturing of a trench by your team earns it one grueling, hard-won point. After such a minor victory has been achieved, you must then aid your team in defending your well-earned prize for a time before continuing on to the next trench or, failing that, being beaten back to start anew. In this, Verdun captures the essence of the period brutally, but beautifully. You are also able to have a variety of characters at your command that are chosen from a "squad." A squad, whether of the Central or Entente powers or factions, have four characters each to choose from, and are further broken down with three loadouts, two of which needing be unlocked via points that you are able to earn. Furthermore, team play is also very encouraged with the inclusion of squad voice chat and squad or team text chat, allowing you to alert your teammates to an incursion into your trench by the enemy. The deadliness of the period is also well represented by the ease with which your character can be brought down to a rather nasty end, whether it be through a bullet to the skull or a mortar round to your hapless, rag doll body. This being said, I must also mention that there are times when game play breaks down to rather nasty spamming of snipers or those that can and do use grenades to a pretentious amount, forcing the enemy team to also stoop to such levels or be annihilated. While this does happen on occasion, it is few enough times to not pose a very large problem, though one that does need some balancing in the hopeful future.\nOf the squads I mentioned earlier, you have seven to choose from between the two sides. Three belong to Germany, where you have the Stosstruppen, Landsers, and Alpenjagers. Another four of the Entente powers include the Canadians, "Tommies," Chasseurs Alpins, and Poilus. All of these have their own four variants of characters and three variants of loadouts, which add up to eighty-four different possibilities. For instance, each squad has a leader that can call down powerful artillery, noxious gas, or recon planes to give the location of enemies to you and your entire team. Or you can have machine gunners that lay down anything within their field of fire. More squad types are on the way according to the Verdun wiki, which should be very interesting in future gameplay, especially if they also were to include the Russian faction as well, though such a squad might have some internal dissention...\nIn any case, with the exception of a few player-based hiccups, there is little that can be said against the game, besides the occasional problems for people to connect to friends at times, which could be a rather essential bug were it not to be addressed. I recommend yes for those that are looking into this game, as it is educational and fun for all that would play as a soldier of the muddy, frightening, maddening, grueling, and wonderful Verdun!","July 6, 2015","true","56.1"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

Haven't played it all that much but with the 3 or so hours i've put in thus far i'm liking it. Many of the maps look fantastic (Playing on highest settings), except the Flanders map which looks like a giant turd. The gameplay is nice, quite like Red Orchestra 2 but with less automatic weapons and more trenches. There is unit variety and each role has a unique feature.\n\nOverall, if you have a decent PC and have enjoyed other historical shooters (like Red Orchestra) then you are sure to enjoy this one.

The maps (for me) do an incedible job of creating and conveying that "feel" of a heavily bombed and trenched landscape. As for being a beta the only thing that i've even noticed were some lag spikes. And thats no biggie for me, annoying but not game breaking.\n\n[[EDIT]] I have been having a bit of a problem at the end of battle which sometimes results in the game hanging in such a way that i have to (manually via alt-tab) close it down and re-start the client/game. Again annoying, but not game breaking for me as it seems to only happen once every 5 or 6 matches. [edit] Two days and an update later the issue is completly resolved. If by some miracle the devs read this you guys rock!\n\nAlso the graphics are beautiful all around with some nice animations for a beta too. Although the movement and associated animations can feel a bit sloppy (reminds me a bit of arma 2) it's a good starting point. Sounds are great as well. Again it's a beta, but probably the most stable and playable beta i've ever had the pleasure of being a part of. Just in case it matters to you, I run Verdun with everything turned UP as high as it goes!\n[My PC = i7 4770 + GTX 770 4GB oc]\n\nHere (as in the real trenches of WW1) if you are silly enough to poke your head up to take a look over the trench, you will most likley catch a bullet in the face. So team work, timing and caution are key. Also the fact that every one is packing a single shot bolt action rifle means that running blindly around a corner, or skylining a ridge or hill top will result in you getting shot (again) and possibly giving your squads position away. I also love the way the battle flows in a similar way to the battles of the first war. Men were massed, a whistle was blown and they went over the top to take the enemy position. The gameplay is a similar series of attacks and counter atacks with little to no ground changing hands (just like the real deal).\n\nMany will not like this as a shooter for many different reasons and thats ok. But if you're looking for something a little harder than the usual shooter Verdun offes what i feel is a refreshing take on the trenches of the first world war. This game requires a more thought out and "calm under fire" aproach. Move as a group, don't bunch up, cover your corners and listen for the gunfire. I can't wait to see what the developers (who are very active and open to feedback) add to the game next!\n\n22/07/14 - Still loving this game. Animations and sounds have been improved and some time soon (I hope) they will be adding gas attacks. This should really shake things up in terms of game play and make storming that trench all the more deadly!\n\n15/02/15 - It just keeps getting better! Now with a new engine this game is starting to really take shape. The graphics are better, the physics (bullet drop/lead) are good and getting better. Gas attacks, trench clubs and to top it all off they now have an Australia/Pacific server. Constant updates and feedback from both the community and the devs keep this game evolving and moving in a very positive direction.\n\nThanks for reading!","May 16, 2014","true","57.7"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Fortunately, Verdun stands out by virtue of the setting - World War I. Despite being almost ideal for translation into gaming, Verdun is the first FPS to really put a player in first-person WWI combat. The attack/defend system is ideal for the core gameplay, and the different abilities within a squad is a nice take on a familiar mechanic. The small dev team is evident as soon you start the game, but really the appeal of Verdun is that it takes place in an oft-overlooked period of history.

Personally I'm glad to finally see this period of our beautiful history taken onto digital entertainment.\n\nAt first you may think it's one of those Red Orchestra title, with unsteady recoil and other "realistic" implements, however the answer is no. Verdun aims to be in the middle between "realistic" let's say Red Orchestra style and bit casual Call of Duty 2( no bullet drop and etc)  and it does it very well. Therfore both groups of players should find Verdun suitable for them. Yes, we have seen it with RO 2 where the devs tried to make the game more "easy" to attrack casual players and we all know how that ended. Verdun is different.\n\nThe key of the game are so called squads, now before you start playing you might want to read very well written guide about it, trust me it will save you being confused when you start playing the game. In other games for example Battlefield the squad thing is optional with Verdun it's a must do thing, you can't pass it. Squads in Verdun make gameplay both tactical and dynamic, if you already have some friends to work together the gameplay expierience will be really pleasant. If not then I'm sure after a while you'll find some friends that will play with you.\n\nOne of the things that I really liked about the game is the "Counter attack" mode, where you take the objective and then have to hold it and vice versa if you lose it, just like in WWI, huh.\n\nThe devs are constantly working to offer us more and better therfore the future of the game looks promising.\n\nIf you are into "WWII" shooters definitely give it a go, no matter if you are into realistic or casual shooters.

This is my first game to try out bolt-action weapons from WWI, and I will say that they are quite "Noob-friendly" and easy to adapt to. The new models on the Central and Entente powers look great! The only issue I have with this game is the optimization. My PC can run Red Orchestra 2 on Ultra at 60 fps but this game runs at 20 fps on high for me. It's not that much of an issue since I can get 35 fps on medium graphics and barely notice a difference, but I suggest that the devs keep working on improving the optimization with each update. Another addition that i think would be nice would be bayonet/trench club charges to give another option while traversing no man's land.","May 14, 2014","true","80.8"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","1"

When I saw this game on the Steam listing, it was like seeing our discussion come to life. With the historical aspects of the Great War as well as the cooperative aspects one looks for in a multiplayer game, Verdun has reached every expection I set when discussion the "hypothetical" WWI shooter. The squad system allows for extremely balanced gameplay in addition to promoting teamwork. Furthermore, the in-game mechanics revolving around trench warfare allow for a sort of "flow" no present in most multiplayer games. Overall, grab a few friends (3+ for maximum efficiency) and have fun travelling back about 100 years to fight alongside others in one of the best multiplayer games I've played in a long time.","December 22, 2013","true","21.6"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","14","21","0","0"

There are melee specific classes and the best method of actually using that weapon is if you lay prone around a corner and wait to hit someone in the cankles to kill them.\n\nAlso there's no friendly fire on.

While there are AAA titles like Battlefield and COD going on, all set with their ACOG sights and HOLO sights and Ergo grips and other tacticool crap on their automatic weapons, there is Verdun. Verdun is a game set in the First World War, also known as the Great War. There aren't any fancy sights, or getting a mag emptied on somebody and not killing them, or airstrikes and tanks. Instead, there are bolt actions, early machine guns, and semi-automatic pistols. Even though this game is in Early Access, and has some bugs here and there, this game is a blast and has a lot of potential in future updates.

Nothing feels more rewarding than getting a lung-shot (1 hit kill with those) from over 200 meters away all while accounting for bullet drop and velocity (lead your target!).\n\nThere are very minor graphical glitches than can occur, but overall it looks and feels fantastic.\n\nIf this is how good it is pre-release, it's going to be one hell of an addictive shooter once fully completed and polished.\n\nA must buy for anyone who enjoys squad-based shooters and wishes to experience a sense of nostalgia no other game out can produce.\n\nGet it and enjoy the feelings of victory, frustration, excitement, surprise, and thrill of the kill all at once.\n\nA definite buy!","August 29, 2014","true","312.9"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

It has the thing in it that makes players feel like were really in the great war. But so far as ive played through out the months of beta and research. The MG-08/15 is still missing the Bipod and lack of firing speed also goes for the chauchat with its low speed of fire. but everything else is just fine. As a player in his review i highly recommend to this game producers to please add vehicles/destructive terrain/usable artillary/naval battle to improve combat experience. For example Battlefield with all its destructive weapons usable in combat, do not change anything else considered up and running. Conclusion is to the question should i buy it?

You will be shot at, blown to bits, stabbed, hacked at, cut down by wire, mauled by a blunt weapon or cut open with a trench spade. This game is brutal. You will feel some kind of shell shock when french 75ers rain down on you and your squad. You will grasp quickly for that "4" button when gas comes up. You will hate yourself for not reloading properly and having no round in the chamber in a pitched situation. This game is gloomy , dark and unforgiving. The maps are brilliantly orchestrated to only allow a few tactics that almost always end with hundreds of deaths by you and your teammates. I've seen pros complaining and yelling about the unfairness of the game. Men and women with hundreds of hours on their record. If you get hit by a bullet, you'll most likely die. One hit, one death. No mercy.\n\nSo why do I do this?\n\nBecause it's supposed to be like that! WW1 is everything but a nice place. This game gives you a glimpse into that dark, unforgiving time. Into the trenches and back out again.\n\nBut is it fun?\n\nOh yes! Tactics are limited, but must be performed in great accuracy. You can  outmaneuver the enemy if you play it right. You can be the hero of your squad or team by being the first in the enemy trench, spitting them with your Rosalie because you have no time to reload. You can stop a whole team with a well places MG 08/15 or some SMLEs in the right place. You can kill 5-7 people at once with a nice mortar hit. But in the end, it's your squad and your team that you have to rely on. They as a whole decide if they attack or if the are dead. This is no game for people to sit in their favorite spot. This is a game in which you have to attack. Or you'll die.\n\nOh … and die you will.\n","April 29, 2015","true","153.4"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","8","10","3","0"

There are four members to a squad and four squads per side (Germany and the Entente (currently the game only focuses on the Western Front.) Both sides take turns attacking and defending their trenches, and the side the takes the most ground will win.\n\nThroughout my time playing this game, I have seen many complaints about the difficulty of this game and how they are nothing but cannon fodder for experienced players. Unfortunately, the game does not have level based matchmaking (it would be impossible with the player counts as they are,) and so as a new player you will face off against veteran players. But, while initially this could be very difficult for new players to handle, most players are using the same (or similar) weapons, and once you learn how to use those weapons, you will be at an level playing field with veterans.\n\nThis game has glitches and other stability issues, but overall is a beauty. You will die, a lot, but that is to be expected from a game about the trenches of the Great War. I would recommend giving Verdun a shot (pun intended) as it is a unique FPS experience.","June 17, 2015","true","185.9"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","8","10","4","0"

The only complaint I have so far is I didn't quite grasp how to actually get an MG playing as the Gunner class when I first started.  You have to select it and spend a point whilst in a match to unlock it.  Some may consider it a waste of a point, but considering most classes, with their upgrades are simply to a different rifle, there isnt much else to spend it on.  Add in that you get quite a good ammount at the start and each time you level up, you'll have the wepons to match your style in no time.\n\nCan't wait for the future updates!\n\nCurrently, 9/10.","May 8, 2015","true","37.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The graphics, while not the best, are quite good for an indie game, and while the UI might not look impressive, it does its job well.  All the different classes and weapons are very well balanced against one another, and the maps offer as much variety in scenery and gameplay as is possible given its setting.  It's gameplay mechanics recreate the back and forth of trench warfare in a manner that doesn't feel forced, and gameplay offers a stark contrast in engagements, either sniping across no-man's-land, where machine guns and rifles dominate, or the savage close quarters trench combat in which pistols and grenades excel.  The only real problem the game suffers from is optimization issues, with lower framerates and higher ping that is to be expected.  However, the developers have done quite a bit to fix this issue, reducing its severity and scope to the point of a minor, occasional annoyance.  In my opinion, this is probably the best shooter obtainable for $20 on Steam, and is well worth its asking price.  I wholeheartedly recommend this game, but feel free to look at more recent gameplay videos to assess its character, and make sure to read the Official Steam Guide to ensure that you understand some of its less-explained mechanics.","March 15","true","22.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","1"

In this case, WWI. That means instead of running around with a silly knife performing ridiculous acrobatic feats and stabbing enemies to death, or wading into battle with an improbably configured, heavily accessorized gun, you'll be crawling across a shattered, shell-pocked wasteland for minutes on end without seeing the enemy, only to get blown up by a lucky mortar shell or find yourself spotted and taken out by a machine gunner. Because that's how WWI was. You'll use the actual weapons fighting men were issued, and their lethality will be accurate— one good hit from a rifle round and you're done. Because that's how WWI was. You'll force a bloody foothold and eventually sweep an enemy trench clean, only to have to defend it from counterattack moments later to hold the few meters you've taken. Because that's how WWI was.\n\nFor a relatively little-known shooter, Verdun is impressive— the take-and-hold dynamic of its gameplay is unique and challenging, rewarding lots of different skills and battlefield roles from combat to command. The environments are well designed and evocative, there's period-accurate gear, squads, and dialog. Gameplay is fun and fluid. Teamwork garners great rewards; a single good officer can effectively win a game if the enemy team doesn't have coordination to match and he's got a cooperative squad under him.\n\nIn terms of cons: the squad level up dynamic can be a bit inaccessible and those who figure it out tend to have a strong advantage, but it doesn't tip the game too badly. Team coordination sadly lacks, possibly weighed down by the somewhat dated automated dialog system of pressing a series of numbers to autotype important phrases; teamwork might be easier if there were a better way to mark up the map, but any HUD elements or "radar" components would also hurt the organic feel of the game, so it's a bit of being stuck between a rock and a hard place from a dev's perspective, I reckon. I find that the trenches don't end up being used as heavily as one might think; I wonder if this has to do with the way the game is designed or the limitations of scale that online gameplay imposes. The only true complaint I have about Verdun is that I want it to be so much more; if you've ever read Sniping in France you know the crucial roles that intelligence gathering, sapping, and trench raids played in the war, and you also find yourself wishing you could try out the trench mortars and artillery pieces scattered around the map. The scale of the war is also sometimes missing, the charges through the creeping barrage, the whistles blowing men over the top. The developer has bult a wonderful foundation which has the potential to become a market-changing game given the chance.","December 25, 2015","true","22.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It isn't about running and gunning. The basis of the game is to attack and defend trenches which is very important, When the enemy attacks, the defenders must defend. This means that players must play the objective which doesn't always happen in games.\nAn important aspect of the game is that it is based around squads. Each player is in a squad and each member of that squad has different skills. Each squad also has an NCO who issues orders.

Where as other games are taking a futuristic approach to war with advanced technology and skills, Verdun takes you back to the early 1900's with an authentic feeling WWI feel.\n\nCurrently there are 2 different game modes to choose from, Frontlines, which is a squad based, team oriented game of capture the trench. In this game mode you must push the opposing team back out and away from their current holding and claim it as your own, or else they will be doing the pushing. The unique aspect of playing Frontlines is the aspect of attack and defend, and how it is handled as the rounds play out. If your team loses their hold on the trench, you are required to fall back to the previous trench and defend from there, hoping not to take a bullet in the back upon retreat. The active objective trench acts as a boundary where both sides can enter and fight for the claim by having more soldiers present (unless teams are unbalanced, this is compensated for). Teamwork is a MUST for a squad/team to succeed.\n\nThe other game type is a free-for-all Rifle Deathmatch, which it just what it sounds like. There are no worries of someone out-gunning you simply because they have bought a better gun or other concerns. Rifle Deathmatch is a true test of skills where everyone has a bolt action rifle, the same amount of ammo, and no individual has an upper-hand based on what you have in-game. There are some options, such as, the type of rifle (all authentic era styles) and very basic attachments. Would you rather have a bayonet for a 1-hit-kill melee, or perhaps a ranged scope for better distance shots? There are pros and cons to either choice.\n\nAll-in-all I rate this game very highly, and would recommend it to anyone and everyone who enjoys the FPS genre, it's a good change from the fast-paced shoot'em ups we have become accustomed to","August 10, 2015","true","18.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

There are times where you will hear the whistle, stand up to leave the trench, and immediately collapse from a rifle shot. It only makes the final push more satisfactory. You may especially enjoy the back and forth dynamic, as defending and assaulting are quite different experiences. Performance during the waves dictates attackers/defenders respawn times and wave duration, rewarding a team which is able to efficiently elliminate many enemies. I would label this a 'Tactical FPS' though it lacks the typically strong learning curve of such games.","December 25, 2014","true","14.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

This game IMHO would be destined to be somewhat Semi-realistic version of the upcoming BF1 AAA-title and most probably enjoy the similar success to their counterparts, the RO series. If you really like fast-paced, detailed and historically correct weapons and loadouts, you will definitely join the ranks in no time :)\n\nPro's:\n1. Authentic weapons and loadouts, somewhat really detailed models and audio is still WiP.\n2. Main selling point of this game is still one of the game mode : Frontlines. Tug of War type of battle, different pace it offers from certain attacking/defending phase is really awesome IMO.\n3. New weapons have been rolled out! Horrors of War DLC has been a huge success and you should try the Wex (Flamethrowers) to roast some "Baguettes" ^^\n4. New Game mode: Squad Defence. Agains hundreds of AI hordes when defending your trench, how long will you survive? ;)\n4. Although it's been released for some time now, Devs have been working on new Spectator Mode, Audio updates, collaborating with Othais from C&R Arsenal, and probably tournaments as well!\n\nCon's:\n1. Lack of Guides and Tips for new players. So make sure you follow your NCO in the trenches and communicate with team all the time to increase survivability in No Man's Land!\n2. Updates sometimes makes the game buggy, but thankfully Devs are on point interacting with the community lately to smooth out the transitions in Unity Engine.\n\nHope you can get  a clear idea what the game looks like now and I'll see you in the trenches ^^\n\n\nfinally after 75+ hours or so playing this game, I can give this a thumbs up review. If you like WW1 or history of it in general, you should buy this game immediately :)\n\nPros :\n1. Rifles, Uniforms, and some of the audio is really authentic\n2. Best game mode: Frontlines. Changing of pace between 'campy' in defence and suddenly enemy breach your trench and you shouting to ur mates, typing like crazy.. one of the best feeling playing this game or on attack when u try infiltrate the flanks and try to clear their trench.. Verdun you did good :)\n3, FREE DLC!!\n\nCons:\n1. Some of the movement and MG placement are glitchy, but hey, look at F1 2015 in comparison :))\n2. The fact you are still reading this review. Go buy it, for god sake! :D","August 22, 2015","true","103.6"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

Get this, it actually uses alot of tactical strategy,so there's balance and limitation. This isn't a bland a circle jerk FPS like most are,but a game of alternating objectives of capturing and defending in a single round. There's no running ahead before you hold you post for the objective amount of time,and attacking requires planning every foot step.

When a game is at beta stage, some people think the game is not so good yet. Verdun is an Idie game at beta stage, and no matter what you think, the game is just great. Of course it has some glitches, and things to be improved, fixed or removed, but anyway, the game is just great. It like the only FPS game I've played about WWI (except for BF1918, but that was a mod). It is like some old shooters with bolt action rifles and one shot-one kill, but with an objective and squad based gameplay. As you can imagine, the main weapons are bolt action rifles, but there are also some other stuff like pistols, machine guns, grenades and mortar/artillery strikes. It makes you feel, when shooting with rifles, if you don't kill an enemy with this shot or if you miss, he is going to kill you. And it is usually that way. Sometimes it can be frustrating, when attacking an enemy trench and not being able to capture it, just like WWI, but it doesn't represent the horrors of trench warfare.\nThere is only one thing I don't like: there are too few players for a such a great game.","January 28, 2014","true","38.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Great for they who like the First World War, great for those who like RTS's, sometimes good for people who like futbol or soccer, but not so great for they who like a single player story.\n\nThe game has been in early access for sometime and now it's completely released.  It's a very well designed game with a lot of historical aspects.  Gas warfare, machine guns, bayonets, soccer during December, and other First World War charms.  Avoid barbed wire, though.

Something I wish other games explored. The game tries to do its best to fit the setting. With songs from the era playing in the menu and people shouting in German and French as Mortar Shells and Rifles sound thorugh the battle.\n\nNow gameplay wise the game is very simple. It's a squad based FPS. With 4 men squads consisting of 1 Officers and 3 Troops each with it's own specializations, unlocks and weapons difrent for each type of squad and each faction. The battles play out in a push defend way. One side attacks, the other defends if the attack succedes the other team has to push the enemy out if it fails they get to counter attack.\n\nGun play is very simple but yet fun. The game is set in WW1 so Most people Run around with a Rifle with the exception of MG's and Officers. You aim, fire and bolt. Repeat till you kill someone or have to reload then repeat the proccess till you are killed. The game adds flavour to this by adding Bayonets, Scopes and Grenades even Pistols to some Classes and Types of Soliders. All in all I found the gun play fun and entertaining.\n\nNow on the bad side.\n\nGraphics are mediocre. This doesn't bother me as in my PoV the gameplay makes up for it.\nSounds are mediocre as well but at least the weapons sound well enough.\nMaps are repetitive so far but this is understandble as the game is Early Access.\nLike any Early Access Game bugs are there and there isn't enough bug spray.\n\n\nBut over all the game has potential it is fun and you can clearly see what the devs want to develop this game into. But this game is not even half way finished. I would recomend you get it on sale or keep an eye out for the game to be fully released but as it stands at 20 Euro's its not worth it. Potential is there but there is not enough value at the moment for that price.\n\n","September 12, 2014","true","58.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The game is divided into two different modes FRONTLINE is squads of four guys attacking trenches and trying to take them from the enemy you have 5-6 minutes to attack then you must defend for around that amount of time. Each class plays a great role in this game the riflemen pushes into the trench trying to take it the sniper kills with range and in my experience are the most deadly players the commanders or whatever you call them are greta being able to order strikes on weak points and call in morter strikes to sometimes great effects as for the machine gunner I have never seen anyone use it to great effect so I can't say anything about it. The tactics for FRONTLINE revolve around using your whole squad in a combined attack but since their is no voice chat yet this rarely happens ^^. As of now there is only four maps Picardee Vossges arrgonne and I always forget the last one they are all fairly fun to play on although I must admit Picardie is the most fun ;). The next form of game mode is RIFLE DEATHMATCH no not the crappy COD kind really nice FFA bolt-action rifle greatness no killstreaks and crap just good old fashioned fun. You get to pick one rifle you want to unlock and you get that you level it up and get new things. Moving on to the community I FREAKING LOVE THE COMMUNITY ON THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Almost everyone in game and on the forums are incredably nice and helpful people offering new players tips and very rarely bad mouthing ( you notice I said rarely it does happen ;) ). I go on the forums vcet players ask me to play with them and they'd give me pointers really nice people online. Probably the funnest people on Verdun are the history buffs I love history and watching these people talk about French battle tactics ETC ETC ETC... is really fun and enjoyable. Moving on to Graphics how are they you ask? They are good I would tell you I myself don't care for graphics as long as the game is fun but I have to say the game is rather good looking the guns are well detailed and look amazing the facial textures and models are terrible but who cares when the gameplay is so fun. The graphics option menu has a bevy yes bevy of graphics optins which is very nice. Over all as a person who usually detests FPS games I find this game very enjoyable it has very few bugs that I have noticed there are a few graphics glitchs but these are rare, And what bugs there are a quickly being fixed by the amazing developers I have looked at posts of when this first came out in alpha and it was terrible but since then the three devs yes only three have worked hard adding new things and fixing bugs making this game very enjoyable. Overall I think this is the bet WW1 shooter your gonna find anywhere and I highly reccomend it to anyone even if you dislike FPS games like me I think you might enjoy this nice game. I hate giving scores but that what most people want but I won't because this is only a BETA everything I say might change in three days in a new patch so I won't bother to give it an overall score till it officially launchs but I still highly reccomend this game anyway I'm out have fun dying to snipers and the OP commander pistols PEACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n\nEDIT: Game released yesterday and its amazing. Haven't played it since August of 2014. The graphics, gameplay, and new features all add a lot to the game.\n\n\nTotally worth buying at full price.

The game has historically had many updates and good ones at that. Weapons are fairly accurate. Squads are fairly accurate. But sadly players will not be.  There is a high spike in learning how to play quickly. Train your eyes.\n\nI do have to give it a terrible side though. Even though I said the updates had been good. The most recent update has ruined my experiance. I used to be able to 11:1 KD but now due to changes that I believe are meant to attempt wear and tear realism. The game has frustrated me.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrivateStar/recommended/242860/","PrivateStar","Starwing","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrivateStar/","56 products in account","Product received for free\n\nIn this review of Verdun I will be covering 5 catagories of gameplay (Which includes game community)\n\n*** Preformance ***\nAlthough the graphics aren't that of the new Battlefield 1 coming out, Verdun is a beautiful looking game for its content and context. If there is one annoyance I have it is the optimization of the game, I run a GTX 750Ti and I can run everything at high and some ultra, and I get about 40-45 FPS when I play, but I have read where some people with higher grade cards experiance lower or even wors frames, but for me it was fine with some drops in FPS the lowest I have had being was 20 FPS but that was at the beginning of a map when everything renders. One other annoyance that ties into community and preformance, some players turn landscape and foliage quality off or too low to get an edge on players, where as if you were hiding in bushes on your screen, on another players with no foliage you would be laying in open ground. Over all preformance out of 10 would be a 7.5, due to the time it has been out and has been repatched time and time again.\n\n*** Gameplay ***\nThe key factor Blackmill was going for in this game was realism and authentisity, and I think they hit that mark to a certain degree, which it is real and fun for both sides fighting. The guns are authentic and so are the squads and languages spoken. I understand if they really wanted to make it realistic by taking out UI and making friendly fire a thing but Blackmill I am assuming wanted to make new players feel welcome without being too harsh in gameplay. Over all score would be a 9 out of 10, the gameplay is spot on with the weaponry mechanics and realism.\n\n*** Mechanics ***\nThe mechanics and such for Verdun are average for me. Running is a little clunky and the default keys to crouch and sprint with are assigned in a very weird place, so I rebound crouch to CTR and sprint to SHIFT. However aside from movement mechanics, the bullet mechanics are well made for a 32 player trenchwarfare FPS, there is bullet drop at long range and if you want a kill while the enemy is rushing toward you at an angle you gotta know how to lead your shots. Over all I give mechanics a clunky but not too shabby 7 out of 10.\n\n*** Realism *** (In a sense of immersion)\nVerdun is spectacular at immersifying me into the trenches of World War I. Sometimes when the artillery is soaring over head i'll take a second to look up, as I hear the yelling of other soldiers in the trench next to me, and there is a certain type of peace as well, looking at the whistiling wizz-bangs overhead. But me gawking usually ends with a German putting a Luger round throught the back of my head, pulling me back to reality, "Oh, I died. Damn."\nA solid 9/10\n\n*** Community ***\nThe Verdun community is very welcoming with most people, even to noobs at the game, dont be afraid to ask questions in all chat, usually a few people will tell you the answer to put your gas mask on. But the unfortunate part about Verdun is the size of the community, its fairly small for such an awesome game, but I am seeing more people playing because of the recent announcement of Battlefield 1, which is good and possibly bad for Blackmill, but Verdun will always hold a place as one of my most favorite games ever. I am veering off track but, the Verdun community is spectacular, if you see Kaiser Wilhelm in game, he's cool as well nice guy. Rating for community 10/10","May 20","true","46.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","2"

Set during World War I. And it does the time period in a very good way.\n\nTrench war is displayed very realistically, and most of the guns kill in one shot, so poke your head out too early and bam, you're dead.\nThe main game mode is called "Frontlines" which pretty much is, attack the enemy trench on command, and if that doesnt work, retreat and defend your own trench line from the enemy counter-attack.\nThere are several factions in the game, with their voices very well done, as well as the weaponry of the time.\nAnd if You happen to get bored of the frontlines, you can always hop in for some bolt-action rifle free-for-all deathmatch, like in good old CoD1 or 2.\n\nAlso, there are few minor bugs within the game,  mostly being sometimes really awful hit-detection.\n\nPros\n- Very original idea about bringing WWI to a shooter.\n- Realistic trench combat\n- Squad based gameplay that favours bold squadplay.\n- Very well done weapons from the era.\n- Several Factions\n- Mostly, fun and enjoyable maps.\n\nCons\n- Sometimes awful hit detection\n- Master server sometimes gets very ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, making it impossible to find a match.\n\nBut in total summary, the game is a strong 8+/10. I'd recommend it for everyone that likes a bit more serious shooter, with a large emphasis on team and squadplay and cooperation.","December 6, 2014","true","22.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

NCO(commander/officer), gunner, machine gunner, grenadier mountain infantry wield shorter, faster-firing rifles, better for shorter range engagements, and they have superior stamina, their officers have recon plane abilities that can reveal enemy locations on the map. regular army squads have 4 people as well but they are better for long-range engagements, their officers have mortar strike abilities.\n\nthe game is set around trench warfare, you will either defend or attack a position. if you accomplish the objective, you earn a point as a team. therefore, the match scores are usually like soccer game scores.\n\nthere is also a deathmatch mode where you unlock your own rifles and attachments.\n\npros:\n\n-authentic gameplay,trench warfare\n-decent visuals\n-unique game\n-concerned developers, even though there is a grand total of 3 of them\n\ncons:\n\n-bugs and stuff. your progress may get reset.\n-certain roles are picked up by people who have absolutely no clue what they are doing...if your officer does not advance, you keep spawning on him, and you will have to walk a lot. it can get quite annoying\n-no automatic team balancing, you can have plenty of games where there is twice as much of the enemy,mostly french outnumbering german teams\n-french rifles have better sights than german rifles. thus, it is easier to hit targets with them. this causes balancing issues where most of the great players will prefer shooting with french rifles. i always play as both german and french and get kills easier with french rifles at range","July 28, 2014","true","197.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

If it is, then the developers simply do not know how to make a game. Major issues for me:\n\nSpawn-killing. This is majorly ♥♥♥♥ing frustrating. On several maps you can be killed a second after spawn by a player with an MG or Sniper Rifle. This is extremely frustrating, especially when your entire team spawns back at the same time and then all get killed a second later by an MG.\n\nThe game has massive problems with lag. I've not played a game without someone jumping around all laggy. It happens too often with too normal ping observed for it to be the players problem.\n\nThe hitboxes seem kind of wonky, coupled with the lag make it frustrating when you clearly hit someone only to have them lag-teleport elsewhere. Even without the lag I find shots that clearly hit not even registing a hit.\n\nThe character class system is annoying and damages the WW1 asthetic. There are 16 players per side. There are 16 classes per side, for a totaly of 32. All are different. Most lack basic things like grenades or a bayonet. Only one person can play a class at a time, so you can't have most people playing a grenadier - likely you would just have 2-3 per team. It's needlessly complicated, especially when each squad has a different uniform representing a different nation so you have to learn 8 different infantry uniforms and 8 different officer uniforms.\n\nThere are problems with the terrain. I don't know what causes it, it's certainly not my computer, but the terrain will only partially loads in. It's not a draw distance thing, because terrain behind it loads in perfectly. But I see a dude's head pop-over a hill, shoot it, only to find I get nothing by the bullet-hits-ground effect. Sure enough, I take a few steps forward and the hill in between use loads a foot higher than it was, and that's what was seperating us.\n\nSee through terrain, related to the previous point. You can't shoot through it.\n\nBarbwire is handled poorly. One small contact with your leg starts killing you. I've been killed without realizing I'm caught  on any because it was so small that I didn't even see it. Also, jumping over it is a waste. Apparently stepping on with thick army boots won't stop it from tearing your flesh? It could've been handled better is my point.\n\nGame feel. There is next to none. No sloshy mud, no soldiers cussing as they reload, no screaming deathrattles, no weather, no nothing. It feels like an empty, quite world devoid of anything that makes me feel like I'm part of it.\n\nThere are other issues, but I can't recall them right now. I'll update if I remember anything new.\n\nI feel like the developers are lying when they said this game was out of beta and finish. I feel ripped off because the game is clearly not finished or polished. I feel you would be better off saving your money.","May 3, 2015","false","7.4"," 94 of 178 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","94","178","2","9"

While lacking a bit of depth gameplay-wise it's still a solid shooter on it's own and the unique setting definitly makes this worth buying.\n\nAs someone who played this games early, early pre-alpha, when it still was browser based I have to say it improved greatly.\nThere has been A LOT of new content and even a few new game mechanics and to me this shows that the developers definitly have a vision for  this game. But now for the actual review:\n\nGameplay:\nI won't lie the gameplay is more or less generic shooter, the gunplay definitly is. Sure bolt-action rifles are uncommon in FPS but by no means completely new. The Squad mechanic is a nice little feature, it actually makes you bond a bit with the people you play, IF you or them don't leave the squad after a few minutes, which is why I'm not sure whether or not the join-in-progress mechanic was a good idea. Verdun lacks the depth of a Red Orchestra concerning health and wounds and the movement system is a bit clunky compared to RO, this shows especially when you try to make your way through No-Mans-Land and get hit because you didn't crouch as fast as you wanted.\nEven though this does sound rather harsh I don't mean to discredit the game. If you have any experience with shooters you won't find this game to be very different, apart from the obvious fact that the weapons aren't full auto of course. It's real strength (for now) isn't the gameplay but the setting. Also I have faith that the Devs know about these 'issues' and will address them in the future.\n\nSetting and Environment:\nLike I said this is what makes this game unique: the World War 1 setting. The Equipment is highly detailed and fairly accurate, and so are the uniforms. The maps are ugly, muddy wastelands, full of craters, wire and tranches which really sells the setting. The maps are also rather diverse, ranging from true trench-riddled wastelands, where lurking over the top will get you killed in a few seconds, to rather open maps which feature a little less deadly razor-wire and a bit more nature.\nThis game only features the western front, where most of the gruesome trench warfare took place. One can play as either different German squads as well as French, English and Canadians. The Voice-acting is rather good, with all sides featuring good, propably even native, and diverse voice actors.

I LOVE IT!\n\nI find this game more fun than any of the Call of Duty's. It's mostly trench warfare with snipers and such but you can get close and use a pistol. I played this game once before and I didn't enjoy it nearly at all because I didn't understand as much, but i'm happpy I gave it another chance.\n\nAlthough, there is things that need to be fixed because this game is in alpha. I haven't noticed much besides that fact that when you die, there is ALOT of frame drop.\n\nThere is alot of weapons besides that you could use though, making this game alot of fun.

It is based off of World War I, and it has a lot of trench combat and squads. There is a good amount of weapons for you to use. There are different rifles, pistols, machine guns, and melee weapons. Some weapons can get attachments like scopes and bayonets. It requires a good deal of teamwork. Often attacking a trench or defending a trench alone will result in a nice simple death. You need teammates to help cover you.\n\nIt may be hard to get used to at first, but if one playstyle isn't working, try another. If you've been talking an assault playstyle most of the time, next time give a flanking playstyle next time and so on. That's how I became a bit better at the game.

To me every kill seems satisfying and it's just something I love to play. It's want a group of friends in game for sure. It can be frustrating at times but I think it was well worth the money. It runs pretty smooth on my older computer so I'm really pleased with this! it's a small community but everyone seems pretty laid back. No matter how far you are behind team members don't rage and its just fun. If you're new to a "class" or "position" team members or even the enemy team will help you get better at it all you have to do is ask for help!\n\nOne of my best experiences in this game was when I made it into the enemy trench, they called gas on us and charged! Most of my team was dead I was one of the few still alive in the trench, I had my gas mask on and my rifle posed and ready, then out of no where 5 guys round the corner one after the other, I have to squint to see them through the gas then I proceed  to just rack in the points mowing them down as the come around the corner, during all this I was being fired on by mortars!

Which to be honest isn't really saying much because there are only few I can really mention right now. Sadly other developers of games think it's a boring time to make games, which is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to me, being deeply interested in the timeframe and the history behind all of the nations. But It's a very great game nonetheless. It has mechanics that absolutely match the setting of the game, 1 hit from a rifle means you're most likley going to die, although 2 shots that means you're lucky and just stay in cover and hopefully your ally can save you or the enemy who shot you gets distracted or something.\n\nThere are 3 mechanics that make it one of my favourite games I've played this year...\n\n1- Bullet mechanics\nAs I've mentioned bullets do extreme amounts of damage and you can't just go run out in the open like Rambo/CoD style like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥, however there is also bullet drop in the game, along with the foggening of the screen and more of a dark tunnel when being shot at rather jelly blood literally being thrown at your face when bein shot, which adds more of the WW1 feel about being in a trench. Which makes a Pistol really deadly in a trench, and a machine gun a beast when shooting at attackers, and the rifle is a good weapon to use all around depending on how you use it\n\n2- Atmosphere/Map design\nAs well a prior statement, however with this I mean by when your running through the trenches, it makes mud sounds when running through them, and even makes it awesome when artillery fires on it and you need to duck and cover from it or you will 99% of the time die. However, No mans land is even more awesome to run through durring an assault on the enemy trench, because you have to worry about barbed wire ripping your legs apart and being left on the field for dead, or using artillery craters as cover because small abandoned, unfinished trenches can't guide you the whole way. Another reason not to run out as a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ rambo/4 Year old CoD player.\n\n3- Chemical Warfare Use\nMy Personal favourite part of the game is the fact that there is different gasses used such as mustard gas, or chlorine gas on the battlefield against your enemies or at you and your allies. What really makes it interesting is that you can go through it so long as you have your gas mask on and you aren't being currently shot at. It doesn't even just come and go also, it stays and lingers the area of impact for about 3-4 minutes and if you die and spawn in it, you need to get your mask on fast or you will certainly die. It's not scripted on each map thankfully, there are special units that can call it in like calling in artillery or commanding squad members, so it will either appear multiple times in one battle or none at all.  That's really on your own opinion whether it's bad or good though.\n\nAnd that's really it, I got the game the day before I made this review, and I think it's better than most of the CoD's combined already. Other than it being a WW1 game, the 3 game mechanics are the best I've seen in a long while. So I highly recommend this game for the stated reasons. The only problems I've seen so far is the body mechanics on when people die, and the melee weapons are a bit overranged, like a small shiv can reach like an officers sword which is strange. But nonetheless this is the greatest WW1 shooter ever made in my opinion. I hope the're a lot of people who agree with me and I don't doubt it at all, considering the countless of positive reviews aside from mine.\n\nFinal Rating: 9/10 for Verdun","August 1, 2015","true","35.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Has a very nice atmosphere to the game and is fun to play with friends. Everything is pretty balanced as far as the eye can see. You got your different squads, each one different from the other. You unlock specializations with carrier points you get from leveling up. And your level depends on the abilities you get in the squad. It's all so dandy!\n\nThere is one problem though, the network connection. Sometimes whilst playing I will take 3 shots at someones head or torso with a pistol or a rifle and they don't die, they take a shot at me and I fall flat on the ground dead. That can occur and if you have a short temper, maybe you shouldn't play this to often.

The Frontlines game mode is the cream of the crop, while the others (rifle deathmatch, co-op, etc) are otherwise insignificant. Despite this however, there is a good amount of content and, while there isn't a huge amount of maps, there is replay value in playing with 11 different squads, with 4 different classes per squad, and of those there are 3 variations of kit.\n\nI could mention other things, such as the squad levelling system affecting squad bonuses as well as the SL abilities and the uniform your troops are equipped with, but ill keep this brief: I bought this for £15 when it was on sale in Early Access, however I can recommend it for the current price point now that it is full release (plus the recent expansion) and I can safely say this has been one of my best purchases I have made from EA.

It is amazing how well the developers captured the atmospher of ww1. the game is very well balenced and rewarding to play. Personaly, what makes this game for me is the uniforms; the amount of detail is outstanding. The devs themselfs seem like great folks. It is very obvious that they love this game and value its community. They have also anounced that they will continue to support this game with new content once they have completed it. This content will feature aditions such as blood and gore mechanics, new game modes and maps, and perhapes the most anticipated, new factions. the USA is sloted for the first release in the form of both US Marines as well as US army. The german army will also be expanded to balance the two sides with the Pioner Squad that will bring the flame thrower to the battle field.\nThis game is a rare gem for those that enjoy atmospher and realistic game play. Anyone coming from a more arcade style shooter may fined the learning curve a bit steep, however i would say that this game is hard to pick up or unfair to new players. It just takes practice and patiance. Once you figure it out its very addicting.\nIll close with one con (because i can really only think of one). Right now it seems that the net code could use a bit of polish. There are a few games ware you will experiance some stutering and isolated telaporting of the enemy and your team mates. this con will obviously be less of a problem for those with strong internet, but i figured that is was worth mentioning.

It's hard to see enemies and if you're leaving yourself out in the open you can consider yourself as good as dead. I often find myself looking for vantage points where I can shoot a couple times and then leave as to not leave myself open to return fire.

It is a First World War fps based around the French-German battle of Verdun in 1916. I'm going to say this straight off the block, the game it seems most like, is Red Orchestra 2: Heroes of Stalingrad, just with lesser quality graphics, less polished gameplay, and funny running animations. This is not a bad thing. Infact it is a good thing in my eyes, whilst not being a big fps fan I was able to enjoy this due to my enjoyment of RO2. The game puts you in squads of 4 men, one person in each squad plays a different class from NCO's, Riflemen, Machine gunners, and Grenadiers and your aim is to keep pushing your enemy back through the lines of trenches, without losing your own. Straight from this you can tell the developers are encouraging teamplay, which is a very good sign. The system works ok on the overall, as you attack a trench, if you take it before the time limit you defend it from counter-attack before moving on, if you fail to attack it you have to defend against a counter-attack also, pretty basic. However I believe the spread of classes into classes that were not very common in WW1 has caused this to change slightly. The 4 man squad 1 per class has meant that 25% of the battlefield are each class, now whilst this goes for teamworking balanced gameplay it lacks that WW1 stalemate kind of authenticity where you get riflemen (the common conscript taking up a large percentage of the army) charging in masses against an enemy trench, clearly in view, getting mowed down by machine gun fire. This means you instead get people sitting around in shell holes with machine guns and shooting at the defenders who can't move far unless they are "executed for deserting" when the machine gunner should be attacking. Whilst I would have loved to see the masses of soldiers charging over no-mans land to the sound of the officers whistle with machine gun fire rattling and men falling head over heels all around you, it is something we have to live with and is evident that is not the path the developers have chosen, it would be hard for that anyway with the terrain being so devastated. My only other grope with the game is the fact that it is purely based on Verdun (hear me out), as whilst this is intentional, I have seen many people complaining about the huge numbers of German players as France seems very unpopular, also a number of German and British players have been complaining at the lack of Great Britain. Maybe when the game expands they will add the somme as a dlc or something, idk. Overall I thoroughly enjoy playing Verdun and feel as though it is one of those games you go on for a quick match, purely for the light hearted (I meant the gameplay not truth behind it) gameplay.\n\nMy rating: 7/10\n\nBuy it if you appreciate that it is still under development, enjoy fps games like RO2, have a fascination for the historical time period, and are willing to give it some time at first. It is a good game and worth paying the cheap price for it.","December 29, 2013","true","121.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","2"

At any one time one side is in their trench defending, not allowed to advance towards the enemy, while the other side is in their own parallel trench being forced to run, crawl and walk over no-man's land towards their (almost) certain doom. Once the attackers reach the enemy trench it becomes a tense game of nerves as danger lurks around every corner. Succeed in capturing the trench and the enemy fall back to another; fail and you are sent back to your own trench to this time defend. In this way a map is played across a set of parallel trenches with advance and fallback, capture and defend.\n\nThe first world war elements are all there - bolt action rifles, hand guns, primitive hand grenades, mustard gas & gas masks, binoculars to spy the enemy position and calling up of mortar strikes. And the maps are full of mud, duckboards, sandbags, bomb craters and burnt out tanks and crashed bi-planes - truly desolate. The sound track is full of French and German commands and cries, with whistles alerting you to your officer's commands.\n\nIt's a truly innovtive game and well worth a try. Do yourself a favour and buy the multi-pack and share the love.","October 12, 2014","true","59.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The gameplay in my opinion is pretty good considering that the game is still in beta. The squads are a unique feature and it has fairly sized maps. Seeing that the game was made by only 3 developers is pretty impressive. The graphics are pretty good and the guns are pretty accurate, The voices were a nice touch too.

If you've only ever had the pleasure of seeing this game on steam, you may fall under this statement. Originally this was a browser based game and the amount of distance it has covered since then is substantial.\n\nHas it been polished to a shining gem capable of reflections? No, but its a great example of what the early access section is capable of; Marked improvement over the duration of its development. It has a lovely community, and the devs listen and provide feedback, covering issues the community sees as most important (bullet drop is a great example).\n\nThe settings are great and immersive, bleak and unwelcoming. The gameplay is unique and really hits a niche with its first world war era backdrop. Charging trenches with grenades and bayonets, then defending against onslaughts of furious counter-attacks is thrilling.\n\nNow I do admitt, the price tag is a little steep, though it isnt to waste. This has the potential to be a great full release, and as of me writing at this moment, it WILL be a great title. Spend the money and help us make it that shining gem that reflects our gleaming smiles.","August 19, 2014","true","1.5"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","1"

Machinegunner was mowing down our troops, so we called for a mortar strike on his position and rushed the trenches. Enemy responded with a gas attack on the immediate area, but we were able to get our masks on in time. Our attack wave ended, so we had to double back and repel the enemy advance. 11/10 for gritty realism.\n\nI got this game gifted to me, and was looking forward to a chance to dive back into the competitive FPS genre. I was very satisfied with the work-in-progress, and am hopeful for the future direction of the game.\n\nIf you like WWI trench warfare, brutal, unforgiving combat, and heavy teamwork (player interaction is more Battlefield-style than Call of Duty's lone wolf, rambo playstyle), then you will enjoy this game. Although the game is very much an early-access product, the development seems strong and consistent, and there is definitely a lot of potential here.\n\nThe aesthetics are pretty good - the amount of detail in the environment is well-done, and the textures have a decent amount of work put in. There isn't any music, however, the  sound assets are fantastic - with practice, you can even distinguish which kind of weapons are being fired just from hearing it. I tried going underwater and firing my weapon, and the sound changes accordingly. Hiding underwater and listening to the difference in gunshots when you come up is pretty cool. The grenade mechanic - if one goes off next to you - is very good, and shooters can even sneak up on you while if they are careful.\n\nThe controls are typical of your generic competitive FPS, and don't take a long time to get used to. There is no tutorial, but there are plenty of helpful members in the community willing to help you out if you just ask. Matchmaking can be a bit confusing at first, but understand that each unique squad (Canadians, Germans, etc) have their own set of 4 classes to choose from, and your squad-class-specific experience carries between matches. Higher levels in a class unlock better loadouts - for example, I reached level 2 in a rifleman class and unlocked a sniper scope. Squads can also level up, and they will receive things like mortar/gas strike abilities. Classes have a maximum of 4 levels to unlock.\n\nThe checks and balances (trade-offs) are very impressive in this game. If you use the sniper scope, for example, it will increase your viewing range significantly, however, it will almost completely eliminate your peripheral view - making it easier for people to sneak past/toward you. Machinegunners are a menace to the trenches, but are easy rifle fodder because of the large muzzle flash they create. The Canadian squad is lightly armed with mostly pistols, however, they are excellent trench rushers and flankers. You can try jumping over barbed wire fences, but if you get stuck or land in one you will take significant damage.\n\nDuring gameplay, you will have to alternate between attack/defend waves, which require the attacking team to try to capture structures or critical areas by having more soldiers within. When the wave timer runs out, the roles will switch, and any attackers caught too deep in enemy territory are automatically executed (defenders also cannot run out too far). You will most likely die from a single rifle/machinegun shot, but can take one or two extra pistol hits. Combat is very satisfying, especially if you can get into a superior firing/kill position overlooking the enemy.\n\nOverall, if you are interested in historical trench warfare, I would strongly suggest you check out this game. I look forward to what the developers have in store for the future.\n\nRecommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews","January 12, 2015","true","3.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Yes, it's definitely not for everyone, but the immersion and setting are astounding.  Core gameplay is fun if not frustrating.  Dying over and over is OK, even expected.  What's more important is objective play.  Gameplay consists of two teams wrestling for land, using a timer system.  Capture the trench and you then must prepare for the counter-attack.  Lose a trench, and you must retreat and regroup.  Dropping people from long-range is extremely gratifying when you pull it off.  There isn't a ton of room for creativity due to it's era, but what's there feels true to form and genuine.  Have your NCO call in a artillery strike, or mustard gas, throw on your gas mask while the enemy is still confused, and start stabbing them with your bayonet.  This game is one-shot-one-kill unless you're using a pistol or MG.  Liken it to similar FPS's like Red Orchestra 2.\n\nWhat's holding Verdun back from being great?  Not lack of content or creativity, a game about the war that coined the term "trench warfare" is to be expected.  It's optimization.  Frequent stutters and dropped frames hinders this game's immersion and playability greatly.  Optimizing your game should not be "turning everything off".  This game is incredibly CPU heavy, a quad-core CPU is absolutely required for a smooth experience.\n\nWith these glaring performance issues, I simply cannot recommend Verdun despite it's extremely gratifying core gameplay.","May 2","false","11.1"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","3"

Great game for coop with a small group of friends (4) as the platoons have their own class and the mechanics forces you to stay with your leader or you automatically get shot for desertion (thumbs up for this). In the future I would like to see the introduction of other army groups (scottish, portuguese, etc) some artillery play, horses, chemicals, dogs, mark I tanks, and other goodies.

They've done a very good job with their attention to detail on the Uniforms, Maps, Weapons, and even the Speech of the soldiers.

Squad combat is great and the different roles feel unique. However, it's the Front-Lines Game-mode that really makes this game shine. One team has to capture a trench or position. While the opposition has to hold them back. Either way, the attacking team has to face a counter attack, whether it's from they old lines after being beaten back, or simply the new one they've just taken!\n\nHowever, this is an early access game. It does have a few problems. Some of the weapons such as the MG's can take a bit to get to, even after selecting that class. The animations are still a little shoddy too.\n\nBut, overall. I have to recommend this game if you have interest in anything WWI related, the fighting is simply to well done to not recommend. You can try and sneak into a relatively weak are of defense, or run out like a madman lobbing grenades everywhere.","November 28, 2014","true","9.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You battle through the trenches, attacking or defending based on your teams momentum. If as an attacker you manage to push into a forward trench and hold it, then the enemy will be forced to retreat to a further back trench. While advancing or retreating you may find yourself in no man's land, where explosions and gunfire tend to tear you apart, but it's still exciting when you survive. There is a good mixture of camping and rushing, due to the offense and defense phases.\n\nThe classes are predefined, so you can't use whatever weapons you want. They are locked to different squad types, and to the different classes within those squad types. For example, a squad leader might only have a pistol, but they also have he ability to call in an artillery strike which can make the difference between holding objectives or not. I personally think it's a good move to have weapons locked to classes, because that eliminates the possibility for everyone to just use machine guns. It allows for a good variety of weaponry on the battlefield, and gives use to the squads.\n\nIt's by no means perfect, and there are really annoying querks like not being able to shoot through barbed wire that happen at times, but overall it's highly enjoyable.

Experience the great war with all the bolt action, trench warfare, chemical weapon fighting you want! As of this review there are a deathmatch and Front lines. The Front lines game mode requires a little bit more explaining. I am going to quote the wiki here for you guys new to the game.\n\n"Frontlines is the most popular type of match played in Verdun. It is a competition between two teams, one French and one German. Each team has up to sixteen players. Each team is divided into squads of up to four players. The teams alternate between offense and defense ("Attack" vs "Defend"). While on offense the team can score a point by capturing the next trench. If the defending team is able to successfully defend their trench from the attack, then they earn a point. The match ends when one team controls the entire map or the timer runs out. "\n\nThere is a lot of detail put into Verdun, but it does have a small playerbase at the moment. The game itself reminds me a bit of the Red Orchestra games in a World War 1 setting. Overall I have got to say I really recommend Verdun, its just got what it takes to be a great game!","August 3, 2015","true","36.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I requested for mortars to be fired on my location in an attempt to kill off the last of the Germans in my trench. I began to stab more and more, I had lost track after the twelfth German had fallen.

The game demonstrates trench warfare perfectly, while the whistle blows I'd hop over the trench and charge the enemy under machine gun fire. Once in the trench, the enemy would drop gas and I'd put my gas mask on. Then my squad and I would take the trench and prepare to charge for the next one. It makes me feel like I'm actually there. This game is entirley unique because, sadly, there are barely any fps set in WW1 out right now. Some cons about the game are the fps. I have a high-end gaming rig and I still manage to get 20-40 fps depending on the map. I know this is still in alpha but I'd like it fixed. Some things I'd like to see in the game are aerial dogfights, and more gore. I think it would look awesome to look up and see planes firing at eachother. But I would definetly like to see more blood and gore the most. It would be more immersive to be pinned down in a blood filled with guts flying everywhere, considering how brutal and rutheless WW1 was. Overall, I do recommend this game in it's current state. I'm sure the devs will fix the fps issue and add more content later on. I rate 8/10.","December 31, 2014","true","19.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Strongest part of the game is that it is very team-based; victory predicates on your team working together, not on kills.\n\nGuns are fun enough to shoot and have minor variations, but as all rifles are one shot kills, the only real differences are clip size, rate of fire, and sightings. Pistols are fun but useless at range, MG's are powerful and are excellent defensive weapons that must be setup to be useful. There is no need to worry about weapons overheating, however, so they can be a bit lacking in depth.\n\nPoison gas is a very cool element of this game and does a great job of mixing up a fight, bringing everyone into close-range shootouts and melees and blocking line of sight.\n\nMap selection is limited, but I do believe more are planned. Their individual quality is surprisingly good considering they are mostly made up of pot-holes and trenches.\n\nPerformance wise Verdun runs OK but tends to have variable performance even on higher end systems with medium graphics settings.\n\nOverall a solid purchase for anything under $20. $23 is acceptable, but this is a game you know will go on sale for deep discounts.","June 16, 2015","true","14.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you are looking for a high speed twitch shooter then this game isn't for you.  That said it has plenty of action, a good mix of strategy, detailed maps, and a fun squad based system.  That said, you definitely want to bring your friends for this one, being in a squad with people you play well with will increase the enjoyment of this game immensely since so much revolves around the squad gameplay.

Devs added new features in good old FPS shooter:\n4 Squads, each 4 players. Each player has a role. And 4 squads in team that has a role too — spotters, close quarters, supports. Finally someone made a true frontline game. Ain't this points that we see everywhere. Something fresh!\nAtmosphere is great. For a first time multiplayer game that depress you with fears and terrors of war. For real, I feel Remarque's spirit in this game. Sometimes when you run from trench to trench, you think — why I'm doing this, what is the reason, why I have to kill another people, but then you getting're you unlock...\n\nWorthy game, especialy on sale. More stuff to come, watch xmas truce event — dat is gorgeous.\n----\nUpdate 16.01.15\nDevs repolished engine, now it's Unity 5. New sound, animations, supression and shellshock features.\n----\nUpdate 27.10.15\nStability increased. Game came out from Early Access. So how it plays?\n\nIt's a son of Insurgency + Red Orchestra 2. Better then Insurgency but not so polished like RO2. U got no tanks here on the battlefield and only 32 players. Weapons are good, you feel them. Game has it's own atmosphere of trench's warfare. Frontline mode -- first you attack then you hold. Devs cut the nerve -- you really feel the insanity of war. You keep dying trying to reach trench, then you got to fall back and it's infinite. I read Remarque's book about WWI and it's really that feel.\n\nBut if you pass this period you will get E.Junger experience. You will start love that insanity. Trench's massacre, close quarters battle rage.\nAlso each map is different. In 1914 it's more about rifle shootings, in 1918 -- class quarters in trenches.\n\n+ Weapons\n+ Well designed historical clothes\n+ Balance -- you need to teamplay\n+ Frontline mode\n+ Devs learn a lot about WW1\n+ Speed Bolting\n\n= Not for everyone.\n\n- Glitch sometimes\n- Only 32 players\n- Bad VoIP\n- No tanks, cars.\n\n\nI'm looking forward that Devs will continue shape and add new features like they did in early access. Great road from more mode than game to Insurgency 2 level game.\n\n05.12.15\nFixed review. Found that there are speed bolting like in RO2.

You battle through the trenches, attacking or defending based on your teams momentum. If as an attacker you manage to push into a forward trench and hold it, then the enemy will be forced to retreat to a further back trench. While advancing or retreating you may find yourself in no man's land, where explosions and gunfire tend to tear you apart, but it's still exciting when you survive. There is a good mixture of camping and rushing, due to the offense and defense phases.\n\nThe classes are predefined, so you can't use whatever weapons you want. They are locked to different squad types, and to the different classes within those squad types. For example, a squad leader might only have a pistol, but they also have he ability to call in an artillery strike which can make the difference between holding objectives or not. I personally think it's a good move to have weapons locked to classes, because that eliminates the possibility for everyone to just use machine guns. It allows for a good variety of weaponry on the battlefield, and gives use to the squads.\n\nIt's by no means perfect, and there are really annoying querks like not being able to shoot through barbed wire that happen at times, but overall it's highly enjoyable. Patches come out frequently, and it really feels like the developers are doing/want to do the best they can with it. I certainly recommend it, especially if you have a group of friends you can squad up with.","May 4, 2015","true","39.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Experience the great war with all the bolt action, trench warfare, chemical weapon fighting you want! As of this review there are a deathmatch and Front lines. The Front lines game mode requires a little bit more explaining. I am going to quote the wiki here for you guys new to the game.\n\n"Frontlines is the most popular type of match played in Verdun. It is a competition between two teams, one French and one German. Each team has up to sixteen players. Each team is divided into squads of up to four players. The teams alternate between offense and defense ("Attack" vs "Defend"). While on offense the team can score a point by capturing the next trench. If the defending team is able to successfully defend their trench from the attack, then they earn a point. The match ends when one team controls the entire map or the timer runs out. "\n\nThere is a lot of detail put into Verdun, but it does have a small playerbase at the moment. The game itself reminds me a bit of the Red Orchestra games in a World War 1 setting. Overall I have got to say I really recommend Verdun, its just got what it takes to be a great game!","August 3, 2015","true","36.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

They should have added bots to this game, because i feel there are too few playerslots per server. Also bots tend to be better at playing the objective than a bunch of random people. Also getting killed by barbed wire is pretty damn stupid\nThe game has some bugs too, I saw a guy that was inside the ground except his head and gun.

Attacking and defending trenches, back and forth.  Some games become quite intense.\n\nAnd, just a reminder: this review is about if I can "Recommend" this game, or not, for others to buy.  Liking the game and recommending it are two different things.\n\n**As of 188, this review was changed to Recommended!  At the time of the change, steam reports the stats of the review as: "1,063 of 1,470 people (72%) found this review helpful"\n\n**As of 210, this game is not ready for release. The gun-play has gone down-hill in the past 15-20 updates, and thus is only frustrating to play.  Consider buying heavily before purchase.\n\nThe Good:\n-----------------\n*Frontlines: Fun trench warfare (Each side randomly attacks the enemy's trench, or defends their own at the start of battle.  You get 1 point for a successful attack/defense.  Team with the highest points wins the match, regardless of who got the most kills.  After each successful attack, you have to defend your newly-earned trench.  After each successful defense, you get to attack the next trench line.  The more players you have in the trench line over the other team, the faster you capture the trench.  =Teamwork is what it's all about!=  Just because you can single-handedly sneak in to an enemy trench and wipe them out yourself, (I've done it before on several occasions) doesn't mean you'll capture the trench, or your teammates will come up to join you quick-enough to stop the flood of enemy players from swamping you and taking back their trench from your lone-assault.  Always communicate with your team, via team-chat "U" and let them know where the enemy is, where you should charge, etc!)\n*Authentic voices (french/german)\n*Attention to detail when it comes to historical accuracy\n*Classes which vary per squad type (currently, there are infantry squads, recon squads and assault squads, each with their own load-outs.  This generates a lot of replayability trying to gain all the class unlocks for each squad type on each side)\n*Each gun has its own sighting (learning how to properly aim each gun is a fun, and rewarding, part of the learning curve)\n*As you play more with the same players, you unlock higher squad levels which have varying effects on everyone's classes.  Most-notably, the mortar upgrade. (which can be extremely devastating)\n*Overall, it can be very fun to play, especially with a few friends.  (best with VOIP, of course)\n*Small, attentive development team that really listens to their playerbase! (I count this as a plus, personally)\n*Gas!  There are four different types of gas attacks to use.  The gas clouds linger for several minutes and basically lock-out a portion of the battlefield.  Try battling in the gas with your gas mask on at your own risk!\n*Shellshock/Suppression! (screen shake for every nearby mortar and a screen that grows more-blurry and grey the more bullets that are shot around you!  Also, the impact sounds match with the screen shakes nicely, giving each mortar a hard, disorienting hit that you can really feel)\n*Graphics updated! Maps look great!\n\nThe Bad:\n-----------\n*Some Sync/net-code issues ("dancing" sometimes works, unless they are fairly close, but zig-zagging is your best bet.  Sometimes, you will see the bullet zoom past you, then you will drop dead.  Getting shot when you're behind a corner, or already standing in a trench from someone who is shooting over the trench)\n*Shot Processing (Shots are chronologically sent to the server as fast as possible.  Whichever shot reaches the server first, no matter if both shots were kill shots, the shot that wins kills its target, and the remaining bullet is completely deleted. Sometimes you will see your gun go off, full animation, sound effect, everything...  Then, you drop dead.  Your opponent, however?  Perfectly fine.  This "bullet erasure" is unacceptable, if a bullet is in the air, it is live, and should stay as such until it strikes something, in my opinion)\n*Assault (gas) squads mostly only have pistols, with a few exceptions and melee weapons. Rifles are fairly high unlocks for them, unless you're a one of a couple specific classes)\n*A few gun/squad balance issues\n**Numerous other small issues/bugs/character rest/Ghost/Reload/Graphics at long distance/falling through the map is still present\n\nMy take: Personally, I love the game--when I don't run into tons of bugs/shot processing issues.  That being said, I've had many, many, many fun, and quite intense, games of Verdun.  It's just, when the BS starts to mount up, its better to put the game down for a while, and come back in a few hours.\n\nSo, with all that said...\n\nDo I like the game? Yes.\nCan I recommend this game? (At list price) Yes! Finally! The game feels great now!\nCan I recommend this game during a sale? Absolutely!  Why are you still reading?! GO BUY IT NOW!\n\nDo I ever regret buying this game?  The game has come a long way since I started playing it.  I have A LOT of fun sometimes.  Other nights, it's just pure frustration.  However, when I first started playing, the issues that used to exist overwhelmed me and I would rarely have higher than 10 kills with some 30+ deaths...  Now, I'm usually at least around a 2:1 or 3:1 k/d ratio per game, sometimes higher.  This varies of course... But, on average, it's about that.  I fought through the issues the game once had, because there was just "something" that kept calling me back to it.  I improved and learned to deal with the issues, until how I feel about the game now and many of the issues were fixed.  Some nights, I am more-than happy I bought the game, even at list price.  Other nights, I'd like nothing more than to uninstall it and never play it again.  Moderating the frustration I have some nights, I find myself coming back to the game over and over again...  Of late, with the responsiveness of a great Dev team, the game is constantly improving and issues are getting adressed.  The game is a lot smoother than it once was, and the shooting feels much better.  The graphics look great.  I love the increased lethality of gas.  And, the shellshock and suppression effects make the game more immersive.  I'm also extremely happy that a long-awaited feature was added as of 188: Private matches!  Now you can set up matches between your friends, or your clan versus another clan, without worrying about anyone else interfering.  However, even considering all these great new changes, it does still have its problems--which, I'm sure will be solved over time.\n\nAlso, a while back, a change to the unlocking system has made it so that you can unlock each loadout for each class after only a handful of games.  While this varies combat a lot, and can provide more intense battles...  This makes playing matches/getting kills a little less rewarding.  Used to, having an '08/15 as a French (Entente) MG was a big deal.  Now, you'll find most of them using it.\n\nOn a personal note: I would like to see a larger variety of weapons in the future, most-of-all. However, a smooth, stable, balanced, bug-free (as much as possible) game is more important to me, than shiney new weapons.  Also, I'd like hipshot accuracy bumped back up slightly.  Not too much, just a little.\n\nThis game is considered Early Access, and will change, and improve over time.  Should the game improve and/or my recommendation change, I'll change this review.\n\n8/10 -- Extremely fun and intense sometimes.  However, it can be a little too buggy sometimes.  Make sure you grab some friends with some VOIP, or make friends in-game!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BRUTAL_/recommended/242860/","BRUTAL_","Zbigni","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BRUTAL_/","183 products in account","To be short. Devs added new features in good old FPS shooter:\n4 Squads, each 4 players. Each player has a role. And 4 squads in team that has a role too — spotters, close quarters, supports. Finally someone made a true frontline game. Ain't this points that we see everywhere. Something fresh!\nAtmosphere is great. For a first time multiplayer game that depress you with fears and terrors of war. For real, I feel Remarque's spirit in this game. Sometimes when you run from trench to trench, you think — why I'm doing this, what is the reason, why I have to kill another people, but then you getting're you unlock...\n\nWorthy game, especialy on sale. More stuff to come, watch xmas truce event — dat is gorgeous.\n----\nUpdate 16.01.15\nDevs repolished engine, now it's Unity 5. New sound, animations, supression and shellshock features.\n----\nUpdate 27.10.15\nStability increased. Game came out from Early Access. So how it plays?\n\nIt's a son of Insurgency + Red Orchestra 2. Better then Insurgency but not so polished like RO2. U got no tanks here on the battlefield and only 32 players. Weapons are good, you feel them. Game has it's own atmosphere of trench's warfare. Frontline mode -- first you attack then you hold. Devs cut the nerve -- you really feel the insanity of war. You keep dying trying to reach trench, then you got to fall back and it's infinite. I read Remarque's book about WWI and it's really that feel.\n\nBut if you pass this period you will get E.Junger experience. You will start love that insanity. Trench's massacre, close quarters battle rage.\nAlso each map is different. In 1914 it's more about rifle shootings, in 1918 -- class quarters in trenches.\n\n+ Weapons\n+ Well designed historical clothes\n+ Balance -- you need to teamplay\n+ Frontline mode\n+ Devs learn a lot about WW1\n+ Speed Bolting\n\n= Not for everyone.\n\n- Glitch sometimes\n- Only 32 players\n- Bad VoIP\n- No tanks, cars.\n\n\nI'm looking forward that Devs will continue shape and add new features like they did in early access. Great road from more mode than game to Insurgency 2 level game.\n\n05.12.15\nFixed review. Found that there are speed bolting like in RO2.

Experience the great war with all the bolt action, trench warfare, chemical weapon fighting you want! As of this review there are a deathmatch and Front lines. The Front lines game mode requires a little bit more explaining. I am going to quote the wiki here for you guys new to the game.\n\n"Frontlines is the most popular type of match played in Verdun. It is a competition between two teams, one French and one German. Each team has up to sixteen players. Each team is divided into squads of up to four players. The teams alternate between offense and defense ("Attack" vs "Defend"). While on offense the team can score a point by capturing the next trench. If the defending team is able to successfully defend their trench from the attack, then they earn a point. The match ends when one team controls the entire map or the timer runs out. "\n\nThere is a lot of detail put into Verdun, but it does have a small playerbase at the moment. The game itself reminds me a bit of the Red Orchestra games in a World War 1 setting. Overall I have got to say I really recommend Verdun, its just got what it takes to be a great game!","August 3, 2015","true","36.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You battle through the trenches, attacking or defending based on your teams momentum. If as an attacker you manage to push into a forward trench and hold it, then the enemy will be forced to retreat to a further back trench. While advancing or retreating you may find yourself in no man's land, where explosions and gunfire tend to tear you apart, but it's still exciting when you survive. There is a good mixture of camping and rushing, due to the offense and defense phases.\n\nThe classes are predefined, so you can't use whatever weapons you want. They are locked to different squad types, and to the different classes within those squad types. For example, a squad leader might only have a pistol, but they also have he ability to call in an artillery strike which can make the difference between holding objectives or not. I personally think it's a good move to have weapons locked to classes, because that eliminates the possibility for everyone to just use machine guns. It allows for a good variety of weaponry on the battlefield, and gives use to the squads.\n\nIt's by no means perfect, and there are really annoying querks like not being able to shoot through barbed wire that happen at times, but overall it's highly enjoyable. Patches come out frequently, and it really feels like the developers are doing/want to do the best they can with it. I certainly recommend it, especially if you have a group of friends you can squad up with.","May 4, 2015","true","39.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Simple as that. Learning curve is not as steep as you'd imagine, and the first hours are a bit frustrating but eventually you will just learn how to survive more than 0.2 seconds in a row.\nIt's realistic, it's cool, and most importantly it's fun. Real fun. If you love WW1 you will love this game.\nEntente Powers and Central Empires are divided in squads (4) each with their own abilities and roles, and each squad is divided into roles (4), each with their own weapons and charateristics, bonuses and maluses (32 players in total may seem few, but trust me, there's a lot of action going on all the time if both armies are full). Each squads also has an NCO providing forward spawn points, artillery, gas attacks, def/atk bonuses and whatnot, depending on the squad you're in. You start with basic equipment, and you can unlock more advanced one with experience points gained on the battlefield. Teamwork is highly valued and encouraged. In fact, highly teamworking teams will be awarded with several bonuses and better armour. Balancing system is extremely clever and fitting, too. Voting system is cool as well.\nJust know that many actions involve real hardcore camping (just as you'd expect, I guess...), but it's fun nonetheless.\nAlso expect a lot of prone blocking.\nAnd some major FPS drop from time to time.\nBut it's still a wonderful game.\nOnly flaw I can think of is the absence of a squad chat.

Strongest part of the game is that it is very team-based; victory predicates on your team working together, not on kills.\n\nGuns are fun enough to shoot and have minor variations, but as all rifles are one shot kills, the only real differences are clip size, rate of fire, and sightings. Pistols are fun but useless at range, MG's are powerful and are excellent defensive weapons that must be setup to be useful. There is no need to worry about weapons overheating, however, so they can be a bit lacking in depth.\n\nPoison gas is a very cool element of this game and does a great job of mixing up a fight, bringing everyone into close-range shootouts and melees and blocking line of sight.\n\nMap selection is limited, but I do believe more are planned. Their individual quality is surprisingly good considering they are mostly made up of pot-holes and trenches.\n\nPerformance wise Verdun runs OK but tends to have variable performance even on higher end systems with medium graphics settings.\n\nOverall a solid purchase for anything under $20. $23 is acceptable, but this is a game you know will go on sale for deep discounts.","June 16, 2015","true","14.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A stray bullet whizzes past your comrades into your heart. Your last breath is a 3rd person view of your comrades awkwardly running into the trench avenging your death!  How glorious.\n\nYou will die by artillery. You will spawn again in 20 seconds and be killed by artillery. You will be an NCO and call artillery on the enemy positions.

Sometimes your charge following your artillery barrage means you caught the enemy by surprise and 5 types of blood wet your bayonet or trench shovel.\n\nThe game is just so much fun. Be patient, be cooperative, and press shift to hold your breath for accurate fire!\n\nThe real mastery of the game comes in how you play each class.

Strongest part of the game is that it is very team-based; victory predicates on your team working together, not on kills.\n\nGuns are fun enough to shoot and have minor variations, but as all rifles are one shot kills, the only real differences are clip size, rate of fire, and sightings. Pistols are fun but useless at range, MG's are powerful and are excellent defensive weapons that must be setup to be useful. There is no need to worry about weapons overheating, however, so they can be a bit lacking in depth.\n\nPoison gas is a very cool element of this game and does a great job of mixing up a fight, bringing everyone into close-range shootouts and melees and blocking line of sight.\n\nMap selection is limited, but I do believe more are planned. Their individual quality is surprisingly good considering they are mostly made up of pot-holes and trenches.\n\nPerformance wise Verdun runs OK but tends to have variable performance even on higher end systems with medium graphics settings.\n\nOverall a solid purchase for anything under $20. $23 is acceptable, but this is a game you know will go on sale for deep discounts.","June 16, 2015","true","14.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It was a bold move to make a game where customizable load outs and spam fire are not an option. You really have to focus each shot and make it count in this game because 99.9% of the time you wont last more than a couple of minutes or run out of ammo. The times where you are invading a trench or defending one really gets your heart pumping because just around the corner there might be 1 or 5 guys waiting for you. All of the weapons are fair and balanced because each load out has its own pros and cons.

The German's attack had lost its momentum and, with the sound of a trumpet, they were in full retreat.  It was our turn to charge.  We formed an unorganized line at the ladders of the front-most trench, joined by a few British units and some Frenchmen.\n\nWhen the whistle blows, the first soldiers scale the walls to enter the chaos of No Man's Land.   But the only place they get to is the muddy floor of the trench.   The next group climbs the ladder, only one makes it out.  The pattern continues until our Corporal gives us the order to attack.  And we do.  The four of us rush to the nearest crater amidst artillery, gunfire, and the roar of a passing flying machine.  Only two of us arrive; the Corporal and I.  And soon that too would change, as, with a faint snap, the Corporal is hit by a stray bullet.\n\nSo, with not a friend in sight, I pull out my trusty shovel and charge.  Germans bullets whiz by and smack against the dirt.  But they do nothing.  I make it into the German trench and wildly swing my entrenching tool in the general direction of the nearest Kraut.  There was a thud and a clang, and he falls dead.  But he was not alone.  His fellow Huns were quick to put me down with their handguns.  But the Jerry that I snagged was their Machine Gunner.  And with that gun unmanned, even for a second, our forces were able to make it further across the ruined fields.  The trench was ours.  And I was a Canadian martyr.\n\nThis is the kind of crazy ♥♥♥♥ that happens all the time in Verdun, and it's absolutely great.  Verdun is truly great, as cinematic as it is challenging.  If you want a quick run-and-gun, a game with little thinking and heavy competitive play, do not buy this game.  This is not Battlefield, and it is not CoD.\n\nBut if you want to experience a realistic depiction of the war, a challengingly realistic FPS, or a team-based game of strategy, Verdun is a must-buy.","May 9","true","14.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

They should have added bots to this game, because i feel there are too few playerslots per server. Also bots tend to be better at playing the objective than a bunch of random people.

Headshots are, of course, always one-shots even with NERF guns. This makes the game so much more satisfying! You can be the last guy in your trench, the enemy are swarming their way in with shouts of "OVER THE TOP, BOYS" and various things in French. You are sitting in the corner, rifle at the ready, having a great time of shooting down everyone who comes into your trench, one at a time. Then I appear and probably stab you with a bayonet. That's just how I roll. Also, the screen shaking, bullet noises, black and white fear affects, and ability to give dead enemies diarrhoea makes this game one of the best FPSs out there.

They are very similar in the way the 'frontlines' game mode, but Verdun is much more squad based and obviously in trenches.  One of the most immersive FPS games I own tbh.  As a seasoned FPS player this game was very easy to pick up and much more challenging and immersive than the likes of some AAA shooters out there today.","May 9","true","47.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The German's attack had lost its momentum and, with the sound of a trumpet, they were in full retreat.  It was our turn to charge.  We formed an unorganized line at the ladders of the front-most trench, joined by a few British units and some Frenchmen.\n\nWhen the whistle blows, the first soldiers scale the walls to enter the chaos of No Man's Land.   But the only place they get to is the muddy floor of the trench.   The next group climbs the ladder, only one makes it out.  The pattern continues until our Corporal gives us the order to attack.  And we do.  The four of us rush to the nearest crater amidst artillery, gunfire, and the roar of a passing flying machine.  Only two of us arrive; the Corporal and I.  And soon that too would change, as, with a faint snap, the Corporal is hit by a stray bullet.\n\nSo, with not a friend in sight, I pull out my trusty shovel and charge.  Germans bullets whiz by and smack against the dirt.  But they do nothing.  I make it into the German trench and wildly swing my entrenching tool in the general direction of the nearest Kraut.  There was a thud and a clang, and he falls dead.  But he was not alone.  His fellow Huns were quick to put me down with their handguns.  But the Jerry that I snagged was their Machine Gunner.  And with that gun unmanned, even for a second, our forces were able to make it further across the ruined fields.  The trench was ours.  And I was a Canadian martyr.\n\nThis is the kind of crazy ♥♥♥♥ that happens all the time in Verdun, and it's absolutely great.  Verdun is truly great, as cinematic as it is challenging.  If you want a quick run-and-gun, a game with little thinking and heavy competitive play, do not buy this game.  This is not Battlefield, and it is not CoD.\n\nBut if you want to experience a realistic depiction of the war, a challengingly realistic FPS, or a team-based game of strategy, Verdun is a must-buy.","May 9","true","14.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/UCGGaddafi/recommended/242860/","UCGGaddafi","[UCG]Gaddafi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/UCGGaddafi/","123 products in account","One of my few serious reviews.\n\nPros:\n\nWW1, very few people do this. They did it right\n\nGood graphics, I like all the graphics they are great and very well textured and thought out. I like that a lot.\n\nPlayer to map size is great, although I do want one more squad per map, I feel some maps such as Pircade are a little under populated and not very fun. One more squad would fix that.\n\nWide range of map choices. From hills to forrest, to a fortress. I like that, I like that a lot.\n\nGreat gunplay, I like how the guns feel and look. They fire accuratley if you hold down shift while looking down. Also when aiming down sight due to your player breathing the scope and gun will move so make sure to shift when aiming down sights when you are about to fire, makes it a lot easier.\n\nNO DLCS, yes this is a PLUS. I am sick of paying for a DLC, I hate them. Excluding EU4 dlcs. But Verdun offers so much when it comes to the one time buy. No pay to win, all skill based which is grea too. I am very glad they do not have a DLC. If they do add a DLC I would hope they add the Eastern front as a DLC for 20 dollars I think is a fair price. New maps, guns and factions for that is what I would 100% buy.\n\nThe gore update is great, I love losing my leg, arm or whatever to a bomb, bullet or nade. I like this a lot.\n\nGreat sounds, very nice\n\nNeutral\n\nI am neutral to the player size, as I said one more squad would be a lot better.\n\nThe maps although good are a bit lacking in some areas but still great. Wish they were more trench like, where you can pier over the side without exposing half your body.\n\nSelection of joining a match is good, which they added how much time is left. I hate joining my favorite map and in 30s the round ends, wish they added a timer in the selection menu.\n\nFiltering out certain squads. I know you can choose your own however it would be a nice touch to add an ability to filter out certain squads such as Canadians, U.S Marines, etc.\n\nCons:\n\nCommunication is the worst I have ever seen. No voice, or at least voice that is useful. They need to add localized voice chat, squad chat and squad leader chat to allow squad leads to talk to each other as well as squad members to talk to each other and localized proxy chat. No one reads chat, no one. It takes too long to type in combat and over all the worst I've seen in a game that requires fast paced action. An example of just 30 minutes ago I was in a match in the fort and a German sat in a corner and fired at everyone who ran by. I saw him. However almost everyone went right by him every time. I was talking in team chat and NO ONE payed attention to it. Also those goes for ALL players pay attention to chat please.\n\nNo campgain however this is a multiplayer game that is expected but if they did add a DLC a campaign would be nice as either German, Americans, French or British would be a great 20 dollar addon that I would buy easily.\n\nNo rewarding upgrades, I use mostly stock guns because they are so good so for players like me who have a good amount of time in no rewarding guns in higher up levels are any good. Excluding MG and Greandier.\n\nCan be a bit glitchy.\n\nMy other complaint about gore is that you cannot shoot a dead body and it splat blood, I wish you could do that.\n\nOverall\n\nYes this is a good game, I would recommend buying it for 25 it is worth it, at FULL price. I got this for cheap on sale so I was very lucky and it has TON of replay ability. The devs constanly update it adding a ton of things. Gore is great. I would rate this 8/10. Worth a buy? Yes.","March 28","true","97.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You really have to focus each shot and make it count in this game because 99.9% of the time you wont last more than a couple of minutes or run out of ammo. The times where you are invading a trench or defending one really gets your heart pumping because just around the corner there might be 1 or 5 guys waiting for you.

Also the soldiers (Both Axis and Entente) look authentic. The experience system makes you come back for more.\n\nThe gameplay itself is straightforward as both teams attempt to takeover the other. The Entente (Allies) go against the Central (Axis) and both teams attack one another until one team has enough momentum to full on crush the other team.

You either play as Entente Powers (French, English, Canadian, Belgian, and American) or as Central Powers (German).\n\nAs of this review, there are four game modes:\n\n1) Rifle Deathmatch: Free for all, rifles only, no teams. New players start here, as all weapons except for one rifle are locked at the beginning of your Verdun career. You have to earn career points to unlock weapons, and you earn career points by doing well in matches.\n\n2) Attrition Full-Arsenal Team Deathmatch: Play on a team as either the Entente or Central powers. Choose a primary & secondary weapon from a variety of authentic weapons used at the Western Front. It's important to note that these weapons are locked to new players. Again, you use career points to unlock weapons.\n\n3) Squad Defence Co-operative Wave defence: Basically a practice mode for Frontlines. Play in a squad of one to four players against endless waves of AI bots. You can still gain XP, medals, and unlock weapons and achievements in this mode.\n\n4) Frontlines Squad Based Trench Warfare: The most complex game mode. I recommend getting experienced in all other modes before even attempting this one. Play in a squad of up to four players as either the Entente or Central powers against other squads. Capture trenchlines and defend trechlines. Teamwork and communication are very important when playing Frontlines.\n\nPROS:\n-Realistic: One shot, one kill with rifles. Bullet drop at long ranges. You have to lead moving targets, expecially at distance. There are suppression/shellshock effects (vision and hearing partially goes out, and you can hear your heart pounding).\n\n-Authentic WWI Weapons: Gas, trench melee weapons, flame throwers, artillery barrages, and of course machine guns to name a few.\n\n-Authentic WWI Battlefield Maps: There are nine total maps at the time of this review: Vauquois (only available in Rifle DM and Attrition), Vosges, Douaumont, Argonne, Champagne (Night), Aisne, Picardie, Artois, and Flanders.\n\n-Gore Mode: A gore option was added in the last major update (which is off by default). Burnt bodies, limbs blown off, caved-in heads, lotsa blood, etc.\n\n-Immersive Sound: Great sound effects, making the game all the more immersive. Sometimes when a player is killed, he'll lay there screaming and writhing in agony for what seems like minutes. Quite demoralizing! (Gore mode must be on).\n\n-Great Community: Compared to other multi-player games I've played, Verdun has a really good community. Most experienced players are friendly and will offer advice to new players if asked.\n\n-Developers Are Very Active: Devs are constantly improving, tweaking, adding to, etc.\n\n-The Only WWI FPS Currently: "Currently" because I just found out that Battlefield 1 is set in WWI, and will be coming out soon. I don't count NecroVision because, well, if you've played it or even seen the store page, you'd understand.\n\nCONS:\n-No Friendly Fire: For such an otherwise realistic game, this is something that really needs to be added.\n\n-Default Keyboard/Mouse Layout: You'll save yourself a lot of aggravation if you modify your keyboard/mouse layout for at least melee before playing. Also, you may want to change the crouch and prone keys.\n\n-Difficult For New Players: There isn't an in-game tutorial, but there are helpful guides and gameplay videos, as well as a spectator mode in-game.\n\n-Glitches/Bugs: There are definitely some issues, rarely something happens that breaks a match. I have had to exit and restart the game a few times due to glitches though.\n\n-Multi-Player Only: This game is really built for multi-player. If the devs did make a single-player campaign, it would be probably be similar to Red Orchestra 2 single-player - separate from the multi-player game, and not much fun.\n\n-Small Community: Weekends are the best times to play on the US server. Any other time, & all you'll be able to play is Frontlines and Squad Defence.\n\nBOTTOM LINE:\nI highly recommend Verdun. It's a frustrating learning experience at first, but stick with it. When you get good at this game, it's a lot of fun! See you in the trenches!\n\n****Original Review Below****\nGreat WWI game! If you like to snipe without a scope, this is the game for you! I've played 5-6 times as of this review, & it's a blast! Devs are CONSTANTLY upgrading/updating.

There are 4 different classes per squad-type. First one is Corporal (at least that's what it is in English!), second one is along the lines of a sniper, third is a Heavy-Gunner (machine gun) and fourth is the dude with the grenades! BOOM!

It is not COD, and it shouldn't be. Every battle begins variously with charging at the enemy and definitely getting gunned down or gunning down the enemy who is charging at you in a near hopeless, but sometimes fruitful attempt to get into the ruddy trench you are in. That's just the experience of the game, but there is far more.\n\nWant to shoot a machine gun? You'll have to work for it. No-one starts this game with machineguns or SMGs, they either end up with a pistol and a bundle of grenades or with one of the bolt-action rifles each of the various entente and central powers sent their boys out with. You'll ask questions like: Why the hell did the French design a rifle with only three rounds that could not be reloaded in between? Why? Then you'll realize the beauty of the Lee Enfield and the utilitarian vigor of the G98. The choice of weapon is decided based on which power your squad is with, the role in the quad you get, and how well you have fought in that role to garner various specializations. It's a nice system, and I have enjoyed the fun of trying to level up every specialty. It's a good way of promoting experiementation which I appreciate.\n\nWhat about Beta?\n\nThis game has some obvious bugs which can screw up the sky and ground, but for the most part, the game still needs development in it's matchmaking capabilities. Too often, players are sent into battles without enough other players, and the game doesn't seem to send new players where they are needed, because you stick with your squad into the net battle. That design has its pros, but the con is that empty games, while uncommon, occur too frequently for a good release.\n\nOftentimes, the servers time out and you get dropped from a game, or your squad doesn't get a position in a battle, and you therefore have to retry making your squad.\n\nThe friend function in the game is skeletal. The developers obviously have the buttons there to make everything else functional, but there is no easy way of connecting players with their steam accounts and getting steam friends into games can sometimes be difficult. There are great examples of how to make this system function, and I think the developers will do it justice.\n\nThe community on the game has been largely understanding of the beta status, as well, and in in-game chat, I've seen the regular amount of trolling and criticism, but it seems that most of the players are pretty into the game with all its drawbacks, and would rather have a good game and some fun, than ruin the experience for anyone else.\n\nVerdun is a great game. There are some problems, but it has the makings to be the first truly successful game set in the Great War. If you have a love for realism, and can deal with being shot repeatedly, you should get it.\n","January 2, 2015","true","226.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The back-and-forth pushing and retreating to and from the trenches across No Mans Land is just as it was. It really gives a sense of the type of warfare conducted 100 years ago.\n\nProper WW1 trench warfare with accurate weapons including chlorine gas attacks, various pushing and retreating cycles, and if you get stuck in the barbed wire, you either die from being stuck and bleeding or get shot. It's only in Beta but it's pretty well done.

It naturally takes historical liberties and these make it not simply a bland historical simulator. The 'frontlines' game type and the maps it is played on is balanced enough that you get these great tug of war scenarios, so every victory really feels like a success. The maps are surprisingly diverse considering the setting, though for being named 'Verdun' there aren't as many sprawling forts as you'd expect.\n\nThere is room for improvement in the squad system (which is far from intuitive) and the way the game deals with team balance.\n\nWhile I play and enjoy a range of games set in historical and current day conflicts, this of all I felt the most uncomfortable about, which is odd. I guess WWI has a particular place in, at least Australia's, cultural psyche.\n\nOverall it is a fun game and I would recommend it.","May 30, 2015","true","33.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's still in beta, so there are still a few kinks (my issues have ONLY been with the menus, no in-match problems yet @ roughly 6 hours of play). Overall, it doesn't FEEL like a beta, at least not like the ones I've played.\n\nThe only thing that is a bit dissapointing is the lack of variety in weaponry. There are 2-3 bolt rifles per side, with unlockable scopes, bayonets and reinforced butts (hehe) depending on which class you play. Some classes like officers can have pistols and binoculars to call in recon or gas/mortar strikes, while flankers can equip rifles or pistols, and are equipped with devastating grenades. There is an LMG class for each side, the German class can only fire while deployed, while the French and British LMG's can be fired while on the move. It would be nice to have some sort of shotgun class (maybe the grenadiers?), but the developers have covered the basic necessities and provided some variety.\n\nOverall, I am highly impressed with this very polished beta, and would recommend it to any of my friends.\n\nEDIT (10/31/15, 210 hrs)\nIt's a few months after the official release, and this game just keeps getting better and better. The devs are putting out 2-3 updates a month, mostly graphical updates and bug fixes. They've announced a ton of FREE upcoming DLC, and post weekly updates to the community and social media that detail progress being made, and discuss where the future updates are headed.\n\nThe player community itself is the best I've ever experienced. Players are (with very few exceptions) helpful, friendly and communicate well. Squad voice chat is useful, and more and more players are using mics and taking advantage of this. Every so often, you'll run across a developer playing in-game and answering questions.\n\nGameplay has improved, squad mechanics have been smoothed, and a team deathmatch (no trench captures, just killing) has been added. Squad roles and classes ahve been revamped, new weapons have been added: knives, shovels, clubs, and more. With more weapons (BAR, 1911, Springfield, shotgun and a German flamethrower) and new squads (Americans, Belgians) coming soon, this game comtinues to hold my interest.\n\nI'd still highly recommend this game for anyone who loves a good shooter, especially historical ones.","December 24, 2014","true","214.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"
