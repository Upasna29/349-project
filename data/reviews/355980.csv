And you liked "Orcs must die!"? Then you'll love "Dungeon Warfare".\nIt's basically OMD without Orcs but with the usual fantasy-dudes.\n\nSometimes very challenging at first, at least if you want to "3-Star" every map from the start, which\ngets slightly easier the more traps you unlock and the more gems you've earned. Sometimes\nyou'll just lack the more fitting trap for some maps.\n\nAnd even if you've 8-runed (each rune adds another difficulty like faster/harder/tougher mobs etc) all maps with 3 stars, you're not done. There's a very nice and\neasy editor to make your own maps. In not 1 hour i've put together a very nice map with lots\nof rounds that was actually fun to play. You can also publish your map right from the game.\n\nBut...early access?\nThis is by far the most complete, balanced and bugfree Alpha i've played in a while. I have\nnot much doubt the dev will deliver a fully polished product.\nBut even if he'd stop right now, i would not feel scammed, as it was a lot of fun for not much bucks :-)\n\nThe good:\nFree placement of traps, no stupid fixed points (which are usually favoured by the lazy devs because it's easier to balance)\nThanks to barricades: Mazing!\nNice soundtrack (so far) and fitting SFX. Kicking mobs into a pit is very satisfying, even after 100 of them :-)\nMany more or less different enemies, each with its own strength and weakness\nAll the usual OMD-traps and some more, all upgradeable\nONE godly power you'll choose before a map. Like traps, spawns or a general recharge-reduction...\nZoom-out-function for the quick overview\nYou'll earn gems for which you can make traps better/cheaper/faster. Like the skulls in OMD\nYou're leveling. Each levelup yields some gems and more importantly it raises starting gold for each map!\nGood balancing, considering it's still alpha, has leveling and upgradeable traps! No easy job to balance this. You'll need an asian for that ,-)\nA nice, friendly and dedicated dev who even publicly posts his email.\nA "re-setup" button after the first retry of a map. Never setup your traps manually all over again just because you've failed :)\nEven though it's 2D you'll never loose the overview. Even when it gets hectic.\n3-Star-System (none reached portal etc.) and on top of that: 8 runes you can activate that makes maps harder. Restrict traps, make mobs tougher/faster/more aggressive, increases cooldown etc.\nEasy to use editor included. Make your own maps!\nThe bad:\nThe sounds can become a bit annoying after some hundred dead troops :-)\nAI seems even dumber than the orcs. If, e.g., mobs have the choice of 3 roads to take, they always choose the shortest way. Which means they choose the heavily trapped way instead of those free roads.\nTotally no story at all (yet). I personally don't care, but some may very well care.\nThe ugly:\nNothing!\nRecommended? YES! Definately a pearl that needs more attention!","June 17, 2015","true","37.5"," 39 of 42 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","39","42","2","6"

One – way TD\nYou can only install the tower along the path which is fixed, the only thing that you can arrange is ‘when’ you install ‘which’ tower.\nThis type of TD is really easy to build for the developer, because of easiness of leveling the difficulty.\nIt is really predictable, and there are no many options for the players to get the goal.\n\n2.	Maze type TD\nYou make your own path with the barricades or obstacles, the only thing which is fixed is entrance and the exit of enemy.\nThis type can be provide wide range freedom to the player, because this TD is all about “how”.\nBut it’s really hard to get a proper leveling.\nBecause depends on the players’ skill, it can be too easy or too hard. And also, it’s really difficult to design vary maps.\nUsually in this case, the differences between maps are only types of enemy or types of tower that you can build.\nThis limit is also connected to the difficulty of the leveling itself.\n\nActually, I prefer the Maze type TD, but it’s really hard to find in the market recently. Because of the limit that I’ve mentioned above, it’s almost not proper as the product to sell.\n\nBecause its natural defect on the volume of the game.\n\nIf you want to sell a TD to the gamer, you have to put “reasonable number of maps” in the game. But not like one way TD, maze TD’s maps can be really similar each other in the different meaning. Because for one way TD, developer can set only one path in one stage, but in the Maze TD there are so many possible ways to play in one stage. So to say numbers of map set itself, one way TD has really big advantage.\n\n\nSorry for so long prologue, but I just like to explain why I like this Dungeon Warfare this much.\n\n\nThis TD is ultimate-proper hybrid which is mix of those two types,\n\n\nDW, it’s not fully maze type, but it is providing maximum level of the freedom for the player with the aspect below.\n\n1.	There is no tower type limit for stages, except very beginning of the game.\n\n2.	Always there are bypass to make a way.\nThere are many kinds of obstacles in the map tile set that player can use. it can help player to make a maze or can be irritating.\n\n3.	But as a design of map, each map has its own character because of fascinating unique features that you would never find in another TD.\n(You never miss the mine cart)\n\nNot only the map design, but also there are many attractive in many aspects.\n\n\n1.	You can set the difficulty very specifically. Normally TD has very simple difficulty level, but in DW, you can set many kind of abilities of enemy.\nEspecially what I love is the “weight of enemy”. This thing can affect hugely to the game.\nThis is a really good example that simple physics how could help make game fun. Bigger unit is slower, heavier ,and harder to throw into the air.\nIt’s really natural, but I couldn’t stop laughing when I saw this.\n\n2.	There are many kinds of towers that you can get.\nI played only 14 hours, and I’m really bad at gaming unfortunately, even I love so much.\nSo I couldn’t go that far. But already I have 9 types of towers, and each of them are very fresh. Especially Harpoon, Push, and the spring.\nI will not mention the specific function of those here. Because if you see the towers in the game that I’ve mentioned, you would know what I mean “fresh”.\n\n3.	User-friendly UI.\nExcept mini-map, which I want to complain about, There is all the needed user interface. Very comfortable to play, and very noticing.\n\n4.	Volume of game.\nI wonder why this game has the early-access tag. This game seems already finished to build, well defined, and has enough volume to play not like other early-access.\nI heard there are 30 maps, and with the difficulty set up that I’ve mentioned, I think it can guarantee more than 30 hours of playing time.\n\n\nBut also there are a few things must be improved further.\n\n\n1.	Music\nI know this is indie game, and there are no many developers to serve on this minor issue, but still it will be really nice if this game has more music.\nAlthough the main-theme is well made for an old gamer, but only one theme for almost 30 stages is still not satisfying.\nI’m playing with my own music, so actually this is not a big issue, but..\n\n2.	MINI MAP!!!!!\nPlease put a mini-map in the UI. It’s really hard to notice if only one enemy sneak out from my maze in the big map. This defect can be more noticeable when you play multi-entry stages.\nEspecially when you play one-life mode, this can be really critical.\n\n\nSo I reviewed this game with my humble word, but I’m pretty sure that I couldn’t express enough the wonderfulness of this game.\n\nGo and get it, and it will give you the maximum fun for 10 bucks.","March 22, 2015","true","33.4"," 35 of 36 people (97%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","97","35","36","2","0"

Charming pixel graphics lend well to the ultraviolence of dart, spike, and push traps, along with all the other fun tricks you'd expect.  The inclusion of a 'rune' system allows you to increase the difficulty on a given level, letting you enjoy it with a fair bit of replayability.  The music is a touch on the flat side, but the sound effects are spot on.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wunder_blunder/recommended/355980/","wunder_blunder","Wunder_Blunder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wunder_blunder/","329 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nDungeon Warfare is the game where you kill or you die.\n\nTo more accurately describe the game, Dungeon Warfare is a tower-defense game focusing on installing traps in pre-defined dungeons in order to kill waves of enemies. The game starts you out with access to only two basic traps: The floor-mounted spike trap, which periodically juts up deadly spikes to damage the enemies above it, and the the wall-mounted dart trap, a device that continuously fires darts at whatever direction it is pointed at. As you progress through more of the levels, more traps types become available. Want to push enemies into a bottomless abyss? The pusher trap's got you covered. Want to burn them? The flamer will take care of that. Want to summon demons to fight for you? You can do that too. Each trap type is unique and varied, with over 13 different types as of this writing and more on the way. The fact that you can only take a limited number of trap types with you into a level means that you will need to plan out your defenses ahead of time. Often I've found myself having to decide just how I was going to deal with that massive wave of peasants in wave 5, for example.\n\nSpeaking of enemies, the enemies that you are fighting are more "good" than most things usually found in dungeons. In Dungeon Warfare YOU are the big bad evil guy, defending your portal from the legions of good. From the humble peasant, slow and weak but deadly in large numbers; the rough and tough warriors, able to take a beating; the theives, quick enough to bypass most of your traps; the mighty knights, that push your damage skills to the test; to the haughty nobles, that have more gold than they know what to do with; with over 12 different enemy types, every enemy in Dungeon Warfare is unique and presents a different challenge to the player.\n\nThe game deals with progression well, allowing the player to learn how to deal with each new enemy type over the course of levels. The game utilizes an experience system to reward the player with bonus starting gold for all levels, as well as "gems". In this game, gems are the currency used to upgrade the trap mastery of each trap, with increasing cost per level. For example, raising your spike trap mastery to level 5 takes 10 gems, as 1 (Level 2) + 2 (Level 3) + 3 (Level 4) + 4 (Level 5). The effects of trap mastery are twofold. Immediately, each increase in level affects the stats of a particular aspect of each trap type: For spike traps, it is a percentage increase in damage, for dart traps, the cooldown time between shots is decreased by a percentage, etc. There is no need it be worried about spending your gems on the wrong upgrades; at any time between levels the player can reset their gems at no cost, allowing them to mix up their play style for the next level. The second effect is that for every 5 levels in a trap mastery the player gains, the player unlocks a new tier of upgrades for that trap. These are straight upgrades that the player can spend gold on during a level to upgrade a single trap, and the upgrades often cost less than it does to place a new trap, although sometimes more can be better; again, depends on the playing field of the level.\n\nOn the topic of levels, for that matter, the game boasts a count of 29 unique maps as of this writing, with more levels being added each week. Also, while not currently implemented, the game will include a level editor that will allow the player to make their own custom levels and share them through steam workshop. Level layout will determine your strategy, forcing you to adapt. Some levels have natural defenses in them, such as bottomless abysses, thin corridors, and minecarts running through the map; figuring out how to best use what you're given is up to you.\n\nIn Dungeon Warfare, your experience total is the sum of all of your best scores across all levels, meaning that it pays to go back and revisit a level to boost your score. What seperates this from most games is the Modifier system that the game uses. In each level, you can choose from nine different modifiers that make the game more (or less!) challenging. Each modifier changes different aspects of the game: The "Nil" modifier decreases the bounty you get from killing enemies by 10%, forcing you to be frugal; the "Anchor" modifier increases enemy health by 5%, and enemy weight by 100%, making shoving them into the abyss much harder; the "Breeze" modifier is for those that are having difficulty, increasing the spawn times between waves, lowering enemy speed and health, but also cutting your score by 40%. All the modifiers affect your final score with multipliers, and up to 8 modifiers can be stacked (with the exception of the breeze modifier) to provide a massive challenge that, should you emerge victorious, gives you a outrageous multipler of x5.23 for your final score for the level. Be warned, this challenge is not for the weak; you will need all the skills you can muster for this monster difficulty.\n\nAll in all, Dungeon Warfare is a promising Early Access game. With more content being continuously added, massive replayability value, and a creator that is vocal and very visible to the public, this is one game you don't want to miss. Now get out there, and wage some DUNGEON WARFARE!","March 19, 2015","true","22.8"," 24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","24","27","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gaist/recommended/355980/","Gaist","Gaist Heidegger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gaist/","1036 products in account","A novel and surprisingly engrossing and addictive tower defense game--albeit, more accurately, dungeon defense.  Pesky heroes are assailing your various lairs en masse and it's down to you to devise elaborate combinations of booby traps and minions to keep them at bay.  Unlike most tower defense games where you're given a bevy of said towers to line some paths and periodically make some mazes, Dungeon Warfare's arsenal plays much more heavily into utilizing the surroundings and managing the different sorts of heroic intruders battering at your dungeon doors.\n\nOne of the most ready examples of this are the pits and chasms that you'll find in many of the locales; there are a number of physics and movement related traps that can push, catapult or pull intruders off ledges and send them tumbling into the abyss (the harpoon trap being particularly brutal and fun--firing a big tethered javelin into enemies and 'reeling them in'.)\n\nDifferent enemies have different properties, so a heavily armored knight is a bit harder to push around than their lighter fare.  Horsemen try to rush through your arsenal to batter down doors and bee-line for your inner sanctum, dwarves seek out your barricades to sap and destroy, adventurers try to duke it out with your minions and are generally nimble, etc.  Similarly, stages can include tracks with mine carts circulating them to plow enemies around in dangerous intersections, spiked walls ready for you to shove lines of troops against them, etc.  You'll also find giant boulders you can set tumbling to crush everyone in its path.\n\nThere are quite a few different traps and setups available at your disposal which can compliment one another fairly well.  I'm pretty fond of a lair that brings about a little necromancer who will go about raising slain enemies as a tiny army of skeletons.  Many of the traps bring Orcs Must Die to mind--but they're solid to take inspiration from (such as the springboards that launch enemies into pits, for instance.)\n\nAccompanying the traps are a bevy of cooldown-based powers you can utilize ranging from giant bear traps to bombs to eggs which hatch minions when enemies draw near or power-ups for your traps.  There is also an excellent 'trap mastery' system wherein you can invest gems to unlocking upgrades for your traps, reducing cooldowns / costs, making them do more damage, etc. (gems being earned by completing stages well and leveling up.)  You can also put gems into basic upgrades such as being able to sustain more enemies in your sanctum before losing, or starting the stages with more gold to work with--and leveling up also gives you more gold to start with as well.\n\nAdditionally, there are 'runes' which can be activated for stages to make them more challenging (faster enemies, fewer resources, limited load-out of traps, etc.) in exchange for more experience bonuses.  Completing a stage with four runes active unlocks the ability to play that stage in 'endless mode' for additional challenge.  Between the runes, large variety of traps and tools, I feel like there's plenty of mileage to be had--and that's before taking into consideration that the game includes a pretty easy to use map editor and Steam Workshop support.  Cool!\n\nIt's hard to fully do the full aesthetic experience of Dungeon Warfare justice in text and I feel like the screenshots don't necessarily do the game justice--but when you've got an elaborate gauntlet of death traps going full-force and a hoard of invaders trying to barge their way through it, it really gets quite rad.  It may seem a bit low-fi at first glance, but when grinders and darts and spring-loaded spikes are firing away while lightning arcs are chaining between knights and necromancers and demons are keeping footmen mired in boiling oil, it's all to fun effect.\n\nIf you're the sort that typically gives tower defense style games a pass, I'd urge a bit of a longer look at this one--I was very surprised by how deep it got its hooks in me; it is definitely the sort of game that if it clicks with you, you'll want to keep pushing on for 'just one more stage.'","November 9, 2015","true","16.5"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","16","16","0","0"

Dungeon Warfare plays out similarly to a 2d version of Orcs Must Die, without a controllable hero. The scoring is also calculated in the same manner - Enemies have a score value and that value is multiplied by the # of different traps involved in their demise. You earn bonus points and gold for killstreaks.\n\nThere is a rune system (similar to the trait system used in GemCraft games) for added challenge that adds a multiplier to your level score. If you beat a stage, the resulting score is given to you in EXP, which allows you to level up, which gives you increased skill points, starting gold, and trap slots (up to 9). You cannot repeatedly farm a stage for EXP, as only increases in your highest score will net more EXP. Every level also has an endless mode, which is unlocked if you  complete the stage with 4 or more runes. Endless mode is a great way to earn extra EXP, as your score for it is separate from your normal high score. There is also an individually selectable rune to make the game easier, for those who want to progress without as much challenge, but you will earn less points.\n\nDifficulty is fairly well balanced. Most of the early stages are a breeze, but later ones will keep even good players up to devise better strategies. There are also interesting achievements to seek out if you are inclined.\n\nGraphics are gritty, fitting the theme. The game has a dark, medieval steampunk look. Nothing looks impressive or detailed.\n\nThe music is redundant. I found it to also fit the theme, but there weren't many tracks. Sounds are limited, but great - especially when units fall into pits.\n\nEnemy variety is important for TD games and there is plenty in this one. There are some that will annoy you, like the horse or dwarf. It's good for a tower defense game to have threatening enemies. Trap (tower) variety is great. There are plenty of interactive cooldown traps to keep you busy.\n\nThere is also a map maker included. You can create and play content made by others.\n\nSince music and graphics are the only arguable weak-points, and those matter least to the tower defense genre, I can say that this is one of the best tower defense games released this year. I didn't encounter a single bug throughout my time with this game. It's well-done.","November 12, 2015","true","37.0"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

This type of game is probably my favourite genre bar RPG. The game does a very good job of introducing different traps each level, allowing you to get to grips with each of them so you know how best to use them.\n\nThe art style is pleasant, I have no issues with a tower defence type game being in the pixel graphics. One of the cool features in Dungeon Warfare is before each level, you are able to select a rune (more than one if you want), each run has a specific debuf which affects you the whole level, but you'll also gain extra experience, there is also one rune which debuffs the enemy and buffs you, but you do get less experience, which is to be expected.\n\nI liked how you could spend gems which you gain for completing a level and going up a level on upgrading your traps. Personally I found the dart gun to be the most effective throughout the whole game. I just set up barricades to create "corridors of death" with multiple dart traps on each end, it seemed to be a winning formula for me.\n\nI have put about eight hours into Dungeon Warfare and have only just finished the campaign.

I have spoken with Groquest, one of the game's developers, for over a month about the game. Thanks to him, I was able to make videos on Youtube (linked at the bottom) about the game, and they show just how far Dungeon Warfare has come. Initially the game was pretty bare bones, but it was still immensly fun.\n\nThere are many different traps in the game that are unlocked by completing levels. The traps range from dart traps that shoot adventurers, to sticky traps that slow them down, to harpoon traps that fire into adventurers and pulls them into pits.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/uncleyar/recommended/355980/","uncleyar","UncleYar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/uncleyar/","2125 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFantastic little tower defense game, one of the best among the top-down point-and-click ones. I'd rate it right after Defense Grid. It's the traps that fling enemies around and the environmental hazards that make it special, they are very fun to put into place and the effects can be downright hilarious. Orcs Must Die had those first, but if you want the same kind of action without the running around (which for me detracts from the strategy, rather than adds to it), this is the game for you.\n\nThe progression system is pleasant and very flexible: new traps are unlocked by completing specific levels, and all levels you finish give you upgrade points to improve turrets. The twist is that those are not just passive upgrades: you unlock lvl 2 of your pusher traps, but you still have to upgrade them in the course of a level using gold from killing invaders. You can redistribute your upgrade points between levels to specialize differently. You can also increase the difficulty of a level by choosing challenges that grant you more XP if you win.\n\nLevel design is good with a lot of variety; some involve a little bit of mazing using barricades. Traps can mostly be placed in pre-existing walls — a few can be placed on the floor — so you don't get the type of freeform design present in Defense Grid where you can build elaborate mazes and your turret themselves act as walls. Perhaps some levels could allow you to place walls, or even some track sections! (Yes there are deadly minecarts running around.)\n\nOverall the gameplay is solid and interesting, so much so that while playing it I find myself wishing to see it used as the base of a larger game of dungeon management. It's a well-crafted and super fun tower defense. Buy it now.","April 6, 2015","true","19.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

I love, love, LOVE Dungeon Warfare. As a Tower Defense game, it does everything right: It's easy to learn and challenging to beat. It features new variations on a classic theme.  It offers on-rails or creative placement, whichever you prefer. Most important: It's just plain fun.\n\nThere are nice touches here that weren't in the Greenlight version. First, there is a feature between levels that allows you to actually increase the difficulty of your game in up to 8 different ways (for example, by reducing your lives to only one, reducing the number of traps you can use, or increasing enemies' strength, speed, or health). Why would you want to do this? Because each additional, potentially crippling selection will increase your xp multiplier! In short, as long as you have the cajones, you can gain some serious xp and, thus, level in fairly short order.  Conversely, you can also make things a bit easier for yourself, at the cost of 40% off any experience you might earn for that board.\n\nThat said, the game still offers balance, and I've never felt overpowered, even as a level seven player on board three. Each level up grants you an ever-increasing number of gems that can be spent to power-up your traps. As new areas are conquered, branching paths open up, offering more variety. Beating each area offers its own rewards, ranging from gems to opening up new trap slots.\n\nSpeaking of variety, there are a number of interesting traps on offer, from push walls to floor spikes; from barricades to melee fighting, demon-spawning portals; from darts to spin blades. The fun comes in trying different combinations, along with using the environment. Watching a well-placed push wall shove an enemy into a bottomless pit, for example, is quite satisfying (and the humorous sound effects really make the moment).\n\nThere are a couple of things that could be improved upon (navigation of the playfield could be better implemented), but the simple truth is this: As I write this, Dungeon Warfare is only on its ninth alpha release, and it's already in better shape than most full releases. I can't wait to see what's coming.\n\nFor fans of the genre, this is well worth the full price of $11.99.","April 1, 2015","true","5.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","3"

I have yet to play through everything or even get the chance to use every tower. If my views change as I play more, I'll update this review.\n\nIn Brief\n\nIf you like Tower Defense games, you will like this one. It doesn't do anything to revolutionize the genre, but throws in some cool towers/traps that add a nice twist, such as being able to push and pull mobs into pits. The pixel style is simple but both looks good and has good animations. The style most likely contributes to the games excellent performance, even when there are a lot of moving and effects on screen. The addition of a map editor is excellent, as most of my time so far has actually been making and playing my own levels. You can also share these levels to the Workshop as well as download and play the creations of other people, giving the game great replayability.\n\nTechnical Stuff\n\nLike I said, the game performs great. I had no issues with anything slowing down, glitching graphically, etc. I was also pleased to see the game ran perfectly despite my two monitor set up. It naturally assumed a Borderless Window sort of mode at 1920x1080 without any adjustments necessary. It's easy to click out to other windows if need be (which with games like this, I'm usually multitasking) and there were no issues using ALT+TAB to get in/out of the game.\n\nMinor Complaints\n\nI think it would be nice to be able to zoom out a bit more than you are, but I don't know if that's technically possible with how the game is made. You do get some fairly large levels to play sometimes, and scrolling around and keeping track of things sort of artificially (perhaps intentionally?) makes the game harder.\n\nUpgrading traps sometimes has the button appear underneath something else, such as a little dropdown at the top of the screen that shows you stats/info about the turret itself. You can still click the button easily enough, but it's just a nuisance that you can't really see what you're doing.","November 6, 2015","true","12.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

And although I haven't found the game where you are constantly upgrading your dungeon and expanding it. This game is one of the best I've played honestly. It's easily up with Bloons TD5 as one of my favorite Tower defense games. All the traps are fun and unique, all the reusable powers are better for each level. Lots of replayability with Endless mode on every map. I don't think there were too many actual flaws with this game at all, I did have a couple of glitches on the final boss. But the battle was so fun I didn't mind playing it 3 times. And... was that a Hearthstone refrence I caught at the end of it?! I was a bit in disbelief. This game is easily worth the full price. And if a sequel comes out I will most certainly be getting it the day of. It is an amazing game.\n\nNo jokes aside 9.8/10","February 13","true","58.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Whether the devs re-balanced the traps in later updates I wouldn't know). Some maps are challenging and allows creative solutions, but many other maps are rather "standard" with just one or two solutions to solve them.

I'm now at 100% achievement progress!\n\nDungeon Warfare may not do anything revolutionary or groundbreaking as far as the genre goes, but that's not what I'm looking for... for a genre with seemingly simple paradigms for mechanics and gameplay... I've sadly come across too many otherwise enjoyable games ruined by poor execution of some facet of the experience (usually by trying to be what they're not). Sometimes, I just want to play a pureblooded tower defense; build some towers and watch the enemies get burned, impaled, shocked, or thrown to their doom, without other genres muddying the waters. This game provides exactly that.\n\nWhat makes this game so good is it boils down the essence of the tower defense experience and everything it does is well executed and enjoyable. Tower defense done right. And because of that, I've had the most fun with a tower defense game that I've had in quite some time!\n\nTL;DR highly recommended for any fan of tower defense!\n\n-- pros/cons --\n\n+ difficulty curve almost perfect (only a couple spots required persistence to progress past)\n+ satisfying tower combinations\n+ solid progression system\n+ little to no grinding to progress\n+ great pixel art\n+ all traps can have purpose depending on playstyle\n+ maps provide ways to use their inherent dangers to your advantage (mine carts, pits)\n+ traps both for the ground and walls so pathway space isn't wasted\n\n- minor UI/UX annoyances\n- only one tier 4 upgrade of each trap type made my OCD go wild\n- would have preferred chiptunes for soundtrack\n\nhats off to the developers, thank you for such a great game!","December 30, 2015","true","37.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In levels you then use these traps and spells to kill heros and what nots. You can chain your traps together to improve their effects. Have a hall of flame thrower traps. At the end of it, have a trap that pops up out of the floor to keep them stuck in the hall.

Being able to view all the wave lists before you start rather than just see the first six would be a good change.\n\nA lot of the levels are clearly designed for you to use barricades to create a long and winding path of death to make the enemy march through. Or they have mine cart tracks to direct them onto. However due to the dwarves blowing up barricades it's often better just not to bother even trying to direct them. On endless mode it quickly becomes pointless having more than one or two barricades meaning that a lot of space on the level is unused. A lot of time is just spent with the repair tool hovering over what few barricades you do have and that gets a little tedious too.\n\nI kind of think that the fully upgraded turret wielding version should be indestructible as it would give you a lot more options and makes levels more fun. Also it is kind of odd that you can build floor traps on top of this barricade which do nothing, except the lightning turret with AOE. It would be good if it could also use the AOE affects from some of the other traps, like poison, fire or bleed.\n\nOnce I had worked that much out and defeated the suicide bombers I got up past a million points on endless on one level only for my portal to be swamped by riderless horses that just charged through everything with dead riders but without a scratch on them. The giant stone golems and the heavily armoured knights fell before they'd even reached my main line of defence but the horses? Despite repeatedly running into walls and bouncing around all over the place whilst on fire and frozen with three harpoons in their backs and non stop lightning bolts frying them they still made it through. So yeah I think they might be a little bit over the top in their current state. Their speed and fact that they don't stop to fight liches or demons makes them powerful enough without also have more health than Jesus... and like Jesus you have to kill them twice.\n\nAlso when you do reach that stage in the game where the entire screen is filled with enemies you can't really see to build or upgrade anything. A build mode toggle option to hide all enemies whilst you place a turret would be nice. As would the ability to see the number of kills per turret or damage dealt.","November 7, 2015","true","104.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A lot of TD games are either too easy or too hard but this game just gets it right:\n\nMost of the levels are easily winnable on the first try, which is a good thing because of the "rune" mechanic. Runes allow you to customize the difficulty in a really big way, making even the easiest levels challenging if you include all 10 of the difficulty-increasing ones. There is, however also one that allows you to play "endless" mode and another one that significantly decreases the difficulty at the cost of the experience you gain from it, which I find really helpful for players that get frustrated when playing the same level over and over without success. This makes for a perfect difficulty progression.\n\nAnother important aspect that really sets this apart from most other TD games is that the variety of towers - or rather:  traps - is remarkable as there are traps that push enemies, traps that pull enemies, traps that spawn minions to stall enemies, AOE traps, traps that counter fast enemies and so on.... This makes for very strategic gameplay because you need to have a good trap composition to counter every type of enemy that comes within a certain level.\n\nAs if it didn't have enough replayability already, this game has a built-in easy-to-use level editor and there are already a lot of user-created maps on the workshop. This is pretty cool but I haven't used it a lot as of the time I write this review (7-8 hours in).\n\nMy only real complaint previously was the lack of key rebinding options but that was fixed soon after I posted this review initially.","November 14, 2015","true","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Generally towers work well when used in combination with others, e.g. a choke point with a spike trap and demons to prevent enemy movement.\n+ Simple physics system with numerous towers that take advantage of it, e.g. harpoon trap pulls enemies towards it and potentially into a pit, spring traps can launch enemies to another part of the maze, etc.\n- The retro graphics style, while not bad, does make it unclear at times what's happening. It's at times impossible to mouse-over a specific entity for more info.\n- No zoom function. Not a massive problem, but it would have been a nice addition.\n- All units seemingly share the same soundset - golems that fall to their deaths will use the same scream as a peasant.\n- Consumable trap feature (basically the "spell" slot) - while it's not a bad thing, I would have liked to see this as an optional feature. The way I like to play TDs is to do all the planning (building of towers) and then just watch the carnage without having to micro-manage the battle using spells. The game is balanced around using these, so simply not using them is not an ideal decision. I recommend adding a rune that disables the consumable trap slot entirely, maybe for something like 1.2-1.35x exp gain.\n\nRecommended if you enjoyed Kingdom Rush, Gemcraft TD or Orcs Must Die.

However this is still one of the more challenging and better tower defense games out there. From first map all the way to even the last map they continue to introduce a new type of enemy to fight.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/B63VqF060Sc","January 12","true","50.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Indeed, within 10 hours of gameplay it entered my top 3 all time favourites of the genre. It's basically Dungeon Keeper (you are the evil dungeon master and you slay waves of "good" adventurers) mixed with Orcs Must Die (the violence and the general tower defense ideas) but without any hero micromanagement. Of course this is all presented with bland retro-style pixel graphics but who cares? Functional visuals in a great game is fine with me.\n\nAll in all I approve of this formula. I love Orcs Must Die (and Dungeon Keeper for that matter) but the action/hero aspect of Orcs Must Die was always my least favourite part of the game. I prefer more strategy and less action. Maximum violence certainly, but strategic violence, and this game delivers strategic violence by the bucketload. Here's hoping these developers keep developing this dandy little tower defense gem.","February 4","true","55.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Like 20+ traps, lots of dungeons to play.  Very fun tower defense.  Each game I am trying new techniques and mixing and matching traps to find the best combination for a specific map.  The 'Runes' (modifiers) is a great addition that allows you to customize the difficulty of a dungeon, thus allowing you to work on gaining XP for your traps, and then coming back later and piling on the runes for max difficulty.","June 4","true","97.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
