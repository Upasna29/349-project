Doesn't that circumvent the whole point of a review, which is to inform people who haven't bought the game? If you are considering buying this game, please read this review in its entirety.\n\nThis game is hard. Its brutally unforgiving. The tutorial is, like those found in many difficult games, worthless. The learning curve is a vertical wall that you must scale, and, for the most part, the only assistance the community is going to provide you is brutal death, game after game. Its a logistical nightmare to keep all of your units refuled, repaired, and rearmed, especially on the front lines where supply vehicles are particularly vulnerable. Forgot a couple key units when reinforcing an objective? Too bad, the enemy reconed your weakness, and you just got steamrolled. Now your teammate is having to divert assests to his flank because your lackluster defense left it exposed. Your teammate is mad because he is now working twice as hard with half the points. You're mad because, despite your best efforts, you got annihilated. Your team loses the game.\n\nSuch is life for most of your matches when you start playing. You will want to stop playing. You will have played 14 matches, and your opponent will have played 1283 (and presumably will be having way more fun than you are at that point). Things will happen more quickly than you can react. You are going to lose a lot.\n\nBut please, I urge you, do not stop. Because, at some point, you will have breakthough. You will begin understand why you were getting wrecked. You will begin to understand how to fix it. You will begin to grasp how to function on the battlefield. Then and there, you will be hooked. Granted, the time it takes to this point may vary for you, dependent on your aptitude for games of this nature. But it will come. And at that point, you will be able to enjoy the depth and complexity of the game, as opposed to just being confused and frustrated by it.\n\nSince the amount of units and consequently wide variety of tactics are available, you will find yourself for hours thinking, "Hmm, what if I did this instead..." and then going to battle to see if it works. Its a nearly infinite loop of trial and error, and in this game, achieving success is so immensely gratifying that, even after decimating an opponent, you will still want to go back to the drawing board to see if you can improve your tactics even further.\n\n-The graphics are wonderful, and even aren't terrible on a laptop.\n-The unit selection is more deep and broad than you should ever need it to be, but its there for you anyway.\n-The bang for your buck for this game (especially if it is on sale) is unparalleled.\n-The game is superbly realistic, and all the unit models are built to near photo accuracy.\n\nIn conclusion, I want to recommend this game to everyone, but I just can't. It takes a lot of time and a lot of patience to get proficient. Personally, I love the game. I love games that make you think and that don't give you any help along the way. Its a game that says, "Here's the problem: solve it or you die" and, while you may have 50 solutions to choose from, you're going to have to figure them all out yourself. If that sounds appealing to you, then please, whether its on sale or not, buy the game. You will not be disappointed.","June 19, 2015","true","328.4"," 241 of 250 people (96%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","96","241","250","12","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jusunor/recommended/222750/","jusunor","Jusunor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jusunor/","302 products in account","Wargame Airland Battle may quite possibly be the best RTS game I have ever played and I have played a lot of them. Airland Battle certainly goes to the top-3 anyway.\n\nIn 1970s and 80s Cold War gets hot and it's your job to command NATO or Warsaw Pact troops. There is an alright single player campaign with interesting innovations and relatively challenging AI. That however is mostly training for multiplayer, because that's where the most fun is going to be.\n\nWe Wargame players always like to remind people about the fact that Wargame is not Command & Conquer. In most cases you can't just send tons of tanks against enemy and expect the side with more units to win. Enemy is propably going to be hiding in cover in an innocent looking forest with ATGMs that may take out one third of your units and suppress the rest before you even spot the enemy.\n\nNo, you have to take into account all sort of things. I'm not sure how to explain clearly enough how many things, so I figured a bunch of examples could do the job.\n\nYou need to have command vehicles that can claim sectors and give you more points. You should also have at least something in reserve guarding these CVs (or artillery units for example) because many players like to send special forces in choppers to take out these expensive and vulnerable units. You have to keep your units supplied because your costly heavy tanks are going to be useless without fuel or ammunition. You need to have AA because there are propably a bunch of tank killer planes or choppers waiting for them. You need recon vehicles because most units (especially armored ones) have poor optics and they can't really shoot if you haven't spotted their targets for them.\n\nThe list just goes on and that's what makes Wargame cool.\n\nIn other words, Wargame series is more complex and way more realistic than standard RTS games. There are over 800 Cold War-era units from 12 nations. They all have their own stats like eg. armor (frontal/side/rear/top), weapons (type/range/precision/power/guidance system etc.), speed (in terrain and on road), size or experience. Sometimes the fight is won by the player who knows the technical data of the units better.\n\nOf course you aren't going to use all these units at once when you play. Wargame Airland Battle has an innovative system called "decks" that define what limited amount of units you have available. Basically you can either make a standard deck in which you choose from all the NATO or Warsaw Pact units the ones you want. Often it is more interesting to choose some limitations for your deck and get some bonuses in return. You can choose to use one specific nationality, to specialize as an armored deck or marine deck for example, or to have only older units. Players can have tons of different decks that can specialize in specific roles and strategies.\n\nOh yes, the strategies. I love the way you can get enemy totally off balance with a successfully pulled cunning plans. Once we managed to attack an enemy reinforcement sector with choppers full of special forces and a command chopper. It was hilarious when we took the reinforcement point allowing me and my team mates to call in heavy armor right behind enemy lines. The poor enemy team got stuck between two fronts.\n\nStill, you shouldn't be intimidated by the amount of stuff to learn even if these things weren't somewhat familiar from other games. Play some singleplayer campaigns against the kind of challenging AI. Go watch a couple of Wargame videos on Youtube because there are some guys who really know what they are doing. Lastly, you can play the campaigns of the previous game, Wargame European Escalation, because they actually teach a lot of basics in a humane pace. It's not the end of the world even if you happened to loose a multiplayer match.\n\nTL;DR: What im trying to say is that Wargame doesn't really get old like many other games because every match is at least a bit different.  Wargame is fun because there are so many strategies to use and anything can happen on the field. That's why it's also challenging always allowing players to get better at it. Wargame combines depth and realism with inventive strategies and kind of Starcraft-like need to react fast to changing situations. If that sounds good, I sincerely reccommend Wargame Airland Battle (as we wait for the sequel).","January 12, 2014","true","84.8"," 81 of 85 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","81","85","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SudsySutherland/recommended/222750/","SudsySutherland","Sudsy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SudsySutherland/","34 products in account","Sadly, I have to start off by saying my time in the military playing with the toys that this game has for units has somewhat colored my experience with this game...  There are quirks about this as a military veteran and wargamer that drive me up the wall (AV-8 Harriers losing eyes on the target they are inbound for when a friendly ground unit is destroyed for example, never mind that the Harrier is inbound and should be 'eyes on' the target already before attacking).  However, EVERY WARGAME I PLAY HAS THESE PROBLEMS.  That is the nature of the wargame, to include the ones we played in the military to prepare for actual wars.\n\nThis game is darn close to what you can expect from a tactical simulation in the 'real world' training environment.  If you get too focused in one area of the battlefield, you will get flanked and bombed from another.  This chaos in a consumer RTS is priceless and should be embraced.  I don't know how many times I've won a scenario and gone 'huh?!' in much the way I'd respond to ENDEX (end of excercise) in the miltary.  Frankly, this is a credit to the developers.  Scenarios can be frustrating hard compared to other RTS wargames out there because of this.  Once you get into the flow of how things work in this game, you'll find yourself enjoying it and likely getting better and some of the other lesser RTS games out there.\n\nWhile there are times I wish the units acted more like real units with the cabilities of their real counterparts, the above described chaos makes this well worth it.\n\nDevelopers:\n\nDo some more homework on how Close Air Support aircraft work.  Just because a friendly ground unit is destroyed doesn't mean that the aircraft magically can't see its target anymore.  Quite the contrary, when an aircraft is inbound onto a target, that unit should stay visible to it, even if others get lost in the blur (fog of war for fixed wing aircraft especially faster movers like the F-16 and MiG-27).  A-10 and SU-25 pilots are less likely to lose their targets, and in fact should be able to spot targets better than others, this is the nature of the attack pilot.  I'm hoping some of these issues are because of lack of processing power and AI limits....\n\nMorale seems a bit too finicky.  I've seen units in plenty of firefights continue on better than units in this game.  It never ceases to amaze me how in RTS games with morale, units break so easy (or conversely, not at all in others).\n\nGoing back to the aircraft, loiter time for some of these aircraft is agonizingly so small, it negates much of the realism I see in other parts of the game.  Even short duration fast movers hang out much longer than the short 30 seconds you get with some of the games airframes.\n\nPerhaps a future scenario set can include units that are limited to the TO&E of actual units.  You get a battalion of this, and that is it for the scenario.  Support is what your brigade/division/corps allocates.  Command points aren't bad though, the cost of units is pretty reasonable to keep the forces limited and close to actual NATO/WARPAC levels in the region.\n\nI will likely play this a lot over the next few years.  Good job, and I highly recommend this to any serious wargamer or anyone burned out with base building RTS games that get too much of a grind to them.","November 18, 2015","true","10.0"," 99 of 115 people (86%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","86","99","115","7","5"

This game is almost an exact replica of RUSE, except for a few mechanics that are overall different with the game. Wargame: Airland Battle is a sequel to the huge-hit of a strategy game called Wargame: European Escalation, which sets you on a collision course with the Warsaw Pact, an alliance of communist nations including Russia. You can play as either the PACT or NATO in an epic campaign to blow up your enemies before they destroy you. It has more units, WAY better graphics, and the new addition of jets. Anyway, let's get to the pros and the cons.\n\nPros:\n- It is easy to run this game on any computer. You can even run this on a laptop with decent graphics.\n- There is a HUGE unit variety. Each unit in every faction serves a purpose, and sometimes you will actually lose a battle because you don't have a specific unit.\n- There are 12 countries, all spread out through 2 factions.\n- There is a decent amount of gamemodes at your disposal.\n- The graphics are BEAUTIFUL if you have a computer able to handle ultra-high graphics.\n- There is no damage bar or health bar for your units. Instead, there is morale, which can be crushed by artillery and prolonged suppressive fire. And if your units are armored, like the M1A1 Abrams, it will be a tough time to even penetrate it's armor.\n- The strategy and tactics in this game are absolutely CRUCIAL to even get far into this game. You need to maintain a stable economy of supplies while at the same time sending more units out to kick some more ♥♥♥.\n- The sounds in this game are pretty good. The explosions sound like explosions, and the whistling of artillery shells and tank cannon shells wizzing by is extremely satisfying.\n- There is an enormous amount of effort for the units, as they look really good.\n- There is a suppressing mechanic, which if you fire artillery or something else at an enemy unit, they will be supressed, meaning they won't be able to move for a short time.\n- The best mechanic is probably the fact that once you lose a unit, you can't get it back for the rest of the game, so tactics to minimize your losses and maximize your kills is crucial for survival.\n- There is an actual fog of war mechanic, as every unit has a sight range. You will NEED scouts and recon units to scope out enemy units and to know what is happening most of the time.\n\nCons: (no game is without its defects)\n- This game is brutal to new players, as even the AI can catch you off guard if you aren't paying attention.\n- The Hud is a huge cluster♥♥♥♥ in large battles, you will be spending precious time trying to find your tank group in the middle of an apparently huge staging area for your allies while your forces get destroyed one by one.\n- The fact that there is no way to get back your units after they are destroyed.\n- The 'maintaining an economy' factor is more often than not overwhelming for noobs.\n- The fact that a group of weaker tanks are almost no match for a stronger tank. Armor is a factor, but eventually the armor has to give, right?\n\nOverall, this is a complex but very fun strategy game. it's like RUSE, but with better graphics and a WAY bigger unit variety. Not to mention the fact that each country has it's own strengths and weaknesses. For instance, America seems to be the most balanced between maneuverability and firepower while being expensive, whereas the Russians are cheap, but pack a big punch. This game is the perfect game if you are a fan of RUSE or any other strategy game like this one.\n\nI will rate this a 9/10. Only missing 10 because of the HUD and some other factors that are in question.","December 16, 2014","true","25.5"," 61 of 66 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","61","66","0","0"

And I feel like i have the countroll over whats happening while playing.\n\nLong: I go after 6 thing i going to rank. GIGS-CO\n\nGameplay:\nI find it realy great. It is many thing that bring it easy to play, but in same time funny to countrol. One eks: can give many comands; move fast, move, attack, spread, regroup, split. This is very importan when it comes to winning or losing. (You can say witch direction thay gonne stay at if you are holding in left mouse butten).\n\nThe zoom out and in fuction are working so well, and so smoth. Thats make it easy to play and fun. The redring is being well done. When both of this is working very well, It vil make the game play both funny and "easy".\n\nUnit countrol is Good and Realistic. It is easy to control them when you have many ordes to control them with. And it realistic cause of many resons, eks. tank. fuel, accrresy, experience, ammo, speed on road and off road, optic, range, camuflage.\nAll this are making the game realistic.\n\nTha combat system are very good. It is like in real life. Sitting in a tank. Does you see the enemy. shoot them or hold.\nUnits does have moral and experience. That make them better or worse.\n\nThis Game does also have a very good AI. I have played likly 50 RTS. And many of them is very sad story. Couse of a bad AI, but a good game is ruind.\nScore 6/6\n\nInterface:\nWhen you have played it a few hours. It will feel much better than the first hour. From my opinon, it was hard to know how thing work and wich unti and unittype tag was hard to learn. But after a few hours game time, It was much more easy to "use".\n\nThe tutorial is easy to step 3. Inantry. From here a person must use his brain in a very diffrent way. It took my 12 hours of skrimish and online to complete the last one.\n\nThe interface is a little hard to "accept" new players. Witch making it hard and boring the first hours. But when you have gone in to the system and gain some experience. Fun as *****. (sory for bad use of words :(   ).\nScore 4/6\n\nGrafic:\nThe job is done well. Looking good on best grafic. The zoom in and out sn redring while playing is making the experience soo good. The terreng is flat. (mostly for making the gameplay better and more fun). If you zoom close in. The detail is HUGE! Everything from a soldier to a tank to houses, bringdes, houses, trees, grass and so on.\nScore 6/6\n\nSystem Requirements:\nFind it a little high. Can be boring to have a bad Pc and playing and lagging so on... But for what of details and redring. I find it well optimased.\nScore 5/6\n\nCampaign:\nFind it funny, and both easy and hard. It is alot of fun while playing. Both part is fun playing and alot of experience that helps to play online. I have read and fund out that people are complaining since it is a tima limmits on 20 min. I find it fine. Couse playing one match against the AI in 90min. Than I have likly 20 match agan... It is a good move from my opinon.\n4.5/6\n\nOnline:\nWas funny to play, before the release of Red Dragon.\nBut I fund the multiplayer funny and "hard". It is a little problem here and there. (mostly caused by players). But online is like offline = FUNNY! And the community, never try to join. Never going to either.\n4/6\n\nTotal: 5/6 or 6/6\nPS.

The game excels in textures, dynamic effects,unit diversity, and multiplayer options. Where it struggles in, however, is the learning curve. While the game, once mastered becomes an absolute blast to play, it IS ruthless and unforgiving to new players. And expect to be a new player for a while.\n\nBut if you can oversee the learning curve, there is nothing else that hampers this game. It is smart enough to automatically assign the ideal graphic settings for your computer, intense enough to offer 10 vs. 10 player skirmishes on a variety of enormous maps, and open enough to make almost every action on the battlefield your call.\n\nIn short, this game is a must-have for any RTS fans, hands down. If you aren't one, though, I strongly urge you to consider the learning curve, as it the steepest in any game I've ever played.","August 31, 2014","true","82.8"," 42 of 45 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","42","45","2","0"

Actually I wanted to LOVE this game. I got Wargame: European Escalation awhile ago and I personally loved that game, it was so damn cool. This game on the other hand is......damn awful. Its horrible!!!\n\nFirst what really pisses me off the most is the AI. Now if your planning on playing singleplayer than DO NOT GET THIS GAME!!! Multiplayer USED to be good but that was many moons ago. Nowadays multiplayer is completely dead and no one ever plays anymore which in turn forces the player to play against the hellish AI if you want to play this game. Guess what!!! The AI is a MASSIVE MASSIVE CHEAT!!!  Now I dont remember W:EE ever having this problem.\n\nI'm guessing your wondering whats wrong with the AI? well I shall tell you.......EVERYTHING!!! So at the start of a skirmish match with the AI you will notice that the AI instantly knows exactly where all your units are placed and what type of units they are. The AI doesnt do any scouting at all they just insantly know everything about your forces and send the exact counters to your units. Another thing that really grinds my gears is that the AI doesnt have a limited resource pool. See if you have ever played another game from the wargame series you would know that you the human player is limited in resourses and at the beginning of a match you must go around the map capturing resource zones in order to gain more resourses to deploy more units......well........... the AI doesnt have to do that AT ALL!!! The AI isnt at all limited in resources and at the very begining of a skirmish match they will simply spam ALL the units that they have in there deck and send them into a MASSIVE blob that steam rolls the player while you struggle to get even a small handfull of units. This combined with the fact that the AI always knows everything about your units and where there at makes playing singleplayer nearly impossible and not fun at all. Multiplayer was fun but now that its dead theres no point to this game.\n\nBut wait! Theres more! The aircraft is unbalanced (kinda like this entire game) for example When attempting to play against the God awful AI you will need some Anti-Air systems because the AI likes to spam lots and lots of aircraft.\nBut! the anti-air is completely uselsess mainly because they cant hit $hit. Even if its a top of the line anti-air system it still cant hit a helicopter thats hovering right in front of it....(not even moving just sitting there in the AA's face and the AA still cant hit it), and thats helicopters! dont even get me started on jet fighters which the AI spams like there going outta style. They zoom over and drop there huge @$$ bombs destroying what little forces you had before your (top of the line) AA can even aim at them, and even if your AA hits a fighter jet it still doesnt destroy it. It takes alot more than it should to shoot down a jet.\n\nThis game was great when multiplayer was alive and if it still was I might actually have recommend this game.....but its not. They make this game look like a fine strategy game, but in reality its just a fancy arcade game with good graphics.\nMy advice. Dont even think about getting this game. Save your money and get the newest Wargame: Red Dragon.\n\nI deeply hope that this review was helpful.\n","April 30","false","5.0"," 87 of 120 people (73%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","73","87","120","9","0"

This game has many differences from its predecessors, all which are worth noting. But take into account that this is MUCH further from the typical RTS genre than its predecessor was as well. If you're looking for an old school experience, this is not the place to find it. This is the place to find the true Wargame experience instead.\n\n+Graphics, astounding, they still hold up, no doubt.\n+The sounds are very well done yet again. You can feel the weight behind every mortar.\n+Wonderful unit variety. The air becomes a lot more important in this game now that planes are a factor in addition to helicopters.\n+A truly fun and unique multiplayer experience. This game has pretty much abandoned Wargame:EE's more old-school approach with the 4v4 battles that mimic the genre many of us are used to and taken on 10v10 massive battles between massive armies, where every player's successes and failures can affect others throughout the map. In addtion there are battles where 20 players play on a smaller map, controlling simply a few portions of a regular-sized army, each player specializing in a field for the most part. Making you feel like you are an infantry squad commander, an artillery leader, or even a strike fighter specialist as everyone must work together to make their army work as efficiently as they can. It requires a lot of teamwork, and is a ton of fun.\n-The WORST idea of a campaign I have ever seen. They threw out the typical narrative/story-based campaign out the window for a more "Dynamic" experience, which sounds GREAT on paper. They even added co-op support! Doesn't that just sound fan-♥♥♥♥ing-tastic!? It does! Unfortunately, it isn't! The campaign is a story-less fight set in the cold war between NATO and the Warsaw Pact. You control one side and must defeat the other side by moving your "chess-pieces" armies around the map, initating combat with any unit they come in contact with. As you lose units in that army, the army becomes weaker. Meaning If they are nearly wiped out, you can find yourself fighting an army with rag-tag remains of an original offense force. Now imagine that in co-op? It's ♥♥♥♥ing HORRIBLE. Rather than giving you the ability to each have your own army pool, you draw from the same pool. My friend and I each controlled ONE unit in a battle once due to the miniscule pool we had. And you keep getting new "Chess-piece" units every few turns as well, most of them don't get wiped out (Nor do they regenerate units or command points) though since the AI is incredibly easy to beat on anything under hard difficulty, so you just fight massive armies with small rag-tag forces in the most painstakingly boring battles you've ever experienced. There's your campaign, enjoy.\n\nPutting my hate aside for their campaign system, this game is still REALLY fun to play with friends against hard AI and against other players. I give the game an 8/10 total. I had a bunch of fun with it, I just suggest very highly that you NEVER touch the campaign. This isn't a must-play, but its definitely an original take on the RTS genre.","June 25, 2015","true","31.9"," 27 of 29 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","27","29","0","0"

It's very unique, interesting, and finally, the gameplay is extremely entertaining! At least in multiplayer, because singleplayer sucks due to dumb AI. Playing with other players, however, gives a very fun experience, but you'd better have a lot of time for a single session because a single battle can take up to a few hours! In this strategy game tactics are more important than anything else, even weaker side may achieve an easy victory if it uses an effective tactics and its enemy does not. The game's units mostly play like rock-paper-scissors, some units are exceedingly effective against other, being average or useless against others, and being more susceptible to some enemy units than to other. Playing the game requires observation, thinking and adaptability to the changing conditions on the battlefield. The two sides are also very distinct and play quite differently. The only downside of the game is that "turtling" tactics works too well in many situations and some games end in stalemate because both players know whomever attacks first is likely to sustain heavy casualties and in consequence lose the game. Nonetheless, it is one of the best RTS games I have ever played and I recommend it to everyone who enjoys strategy games. Oh, and 10 vs 10 battles are just epic!\n","March 24","true","14.5"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","19","21","3","0"

Ridiculous. The AI also cheats terribly, such as being able to take control of sectors within three seconds of start, and deploying with more points than it actually has.\n\nI regret this purchase.

So re-writing it.\n\nOne of the best games I've ever played. The level of depth is absolutely huge, with 800+ distinct units spread out across NATO and Warsaw Pact nations during the mid 1980s. The complicated nature of this game is daunting at first but ensures that learning and getting better is hugely satisfying. There's not a single round I play where I don't learn something/gain experience. The game is also hugely interesting to anyone with a basic interest in the military, politics and warfare. Just pouring over the units in the armoury is a big amount of fun in itself.\n\nThe developers do a fantastic job of modelling the strengths and weaknesses of each nation. Armies of large nations such as the USA and the USSR have all the usual units and vehicles you expect, but also many others too. Equal attention is given to the minor countries like East Germany, Denmark, Norway, Poland, etc. All of them are faithfully modelled and recreated.\n\nIn short, this game is a must have for any fan of strategy. It rewards proper thinking, cool-headedness and a willingness to learn. One of my all time greats.","August 23, 2013","true","617.8"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","3"

Co-ordination is key. Enough units and map space to play a specific roll for your team if you wish.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=287115223\n\nOne of the few RTS's I've played where Air units behave like Air units.\nLimtied time in the air, they cover large areas when flying in a holding pattern, and need to be used wisely. Breaking off and getting them out of combat is just as important as getting them in. You will not be swarming the air with great numbers, in fact you'll be using them in tight pairsto double up aroll or to work in multiroll tandem. You'll find yourself cheering when a small group of fighters makes a great little sortie over enemy space just barely making it out alive as your cluster bombs and napalm lay waste to an enemy position. And tense when you watch an air-to-air battle take place over the front line and it gets down to the wire.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkOnU671RMc&list=PLWzVnh9-QBKTMDLnxI8hjGmwUbGmwLLGW\nThere is a good chance at first you will lose a lot at first. It can be very tough while learning the details. RECON is key. Keep your eyes hidden everywhere on the field, and destroy thier RECON as much as possible.Blind your enemy and you have them.\n\nThis is not a game of just "swarming" with units. You'll need to use the terrain, overlap your defence and attack units. And figure out where to hide all the recon you'll need. This RTS feels far more like a good warfare sim, instead of just another generic RTS. Definately for the serious RTS'er who's looking for a good modern warfare based game. PLus you'll be nicely rewarded with some great imagery!\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=288848407All the visually cinematic moments you could want when you put a plan into action. And with the SAVE REPLAY option you can go back and watch the enitre battle with a free cam and no HUD for the most clear spectating of your strategy and tactics at work.\nIf you know that some losses are part of winning then this will be for you. If you like to zoom in and watch the action, this is for you. If you like to see action in RTS's not just "representations" of it, this is for you.\n\n[*NOTE: These animated gif's are from my gameplay REPLAYS, hence the lack of HUD. Sadly, being able to temporarily remove the HUD during actual gameplay is missing.]","July 16, 2014","true","83.5"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

It doesn't give cool special abilities to differnet units or try and add interesting mechanics, but on the other hand as a simulation it's severely lacking in depth and oversimplification.\n\nI personally didn't care for it, maybe it's because I didn't understand it?

Wargame Airland Battle is a modern day military real time strategy game where you command armies and units individually of your choice on massive maps with up to 10v10 games. You create your armies by creating decks where you get a certain amount of "cards" or units to choose from out of the hundreds there are in the game. The big part however is that each of these units are all different having their own extremely detailed unique stats making creating an army much more of a fun challenge then let’s say just spamming one or two types of a specific unit to win a game. You won’t win in this game without taking advantage of combined arms and although an M1 Abrams horde sounds appealing, a well-entrenched anti-tank team or attack helicopter will make short work of those tanks. So yes I definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys strategy because you won’t find anything more in depth in terms of tactics and strategy than this on the market currently.","December 3, 2013","true","80.3"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

Wheras in starcraft 2 economy is everything and APM is your life, in this game, strategy, positioning and most importantly, countering, are paramount. If you liked World in Conlict, you'll like this game. Also you might like this game if you are a fan of Magic: the Gathering, because of the deck building mechanic. In each game you play, you choose a deck of units to bring into battle, that you have preconstructed. Decks have various constraints that can be put on them to make them more powerful in certain areas, and the possibilites are endless, from Norwegian Armoured Decks, to Soviet Marine Decks, this game has it all.\nThe best part? All the DLC is free. Not just for this game, but for every game in the series.\nPlaying around with the various units, and building, testing, refining then testing your decks again is one of my favorite things in the game to do.\nThe only downside to this game is that the sequel, Red Dragon is set to come out in March 2014. As of this review, that is less than 4 months away. If you are hurting for money, you may want to save it for Red Dragon. It promises to add naval units and East Asian nations like Japan and North Korea.\nAll in all, whatever game happens to be the latest in the Wargame series at the time that you read this is a must buy.\n10/10","December 19, 2013","true","479.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

It strives on realism, scale, cooperation between players and unit synergy. This makes it really complex, and thus, really challenging for new players, but given time, you will learn everything you need to win.\n\nThe best part of this game is the customization. You can build unit decks any way you want. You can choose to only have units available from a single country, gaining access to its prototypes, specialize in a certain doctrine (mechanized, marine, air assault, etc.), and even restrict yourself to units developed up to a certain year (1980 or 1975), which bars you from choosing their more advanced units, but makes the units you do have available more numerous to balance it out.\n\nThe single-player is pretty light on content; the real meat of the game is the multiplayer. You can choose to stage simple 1v1s, up to 4v4s, and finally, enormous 10v10s. The maps are large, and their terrain allows for several avenues of completing your objective. The combat is lovingly rendered with exquisite detail, allowing you to view them from a bird's eye view, all the way down to ground level, where the meat of the action is. The sound design is stellar, as well. Every shot fired gives off a meaty *THOOMP*, even when viewing the action from afar.\n\nSo yeah. If you love complex strategy games and are a fan of modern warfare, buy Wargame: AirLand Assault ASAP.

The developer is competent and clearly in love with the source material. Each unit is lovingly crafted. Matches can be long slugfests or blitzkrieg smack-downs. There's not a whole lot that's more satifsying than successfully punching through your enemies defensive line, or prying open weaknesses on the their flank, or strafing a light vehicle column. No RTS does contemporary warfare better than Wargame, and it'll probably be a long time until we see anything that even comes close.\n\nGraphics: Great. All the units look amazing. The level of detail you can get from zooming is phenomenal.\n\nSound: The music is dull. I recommend playing classical or 70's era Rock and Roll. The sounds are fitting and in the case of the heavier weapons, satisfying.\n\nGameplay: The UI is unobtrusive and conveys what it needs to to the player... most of the time. Sometimes things get hairy when there's a big engagement happening and it just looks like a mess of squares. There's no unlocking like in European Escalation, and that's a good thing. Airplanes are an amazing edition and well-balanced.\n\nReplayability: Multiplayer is where it's at, and whether you're trying to perfect your strategies or tinkering with a new deck, there's plenty of reason to come back for more.\n\nAll in all, if you're a fan of RTS you should pick up this game.

Sadly  I think the reason for this is that the AI simply isnt good enough to choose good targets and keep things interesting for the long run.\n\nThat said the game still offers hundreds of hours of play time with hundreds if not thousands of realisticly modelled units. And speaking of units it is especially interesting to see the less known scandinavian armies from this time in some kind of action.\n\nThe multiplayer is ok, but not my cup of tea and full of armchair generals and casual racism and ignorance you can expect in a game about alternative history so if that bothers you stay away from those parts.\nIf you do venture into MP , try the big 10v10 battles since then you can mess up and it still will not sink the whole game.\n\nIf you want to see the game in action I have a  campaign playtrhough here :\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0e0TPzQzCk&list=PLz7KvqI76RO15Yhoi3mvyNqBrU7SxJFM6","November 5, 2015","true","76.4"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","10","14","0","0"

Co-op is a blast, and jumping in to a 10v10 lobby is an effective way to lose yourself for an hour or so. You'll have a lot to learn, but the game is so full of satisfying moments that it'll all feel worth it in the end.\n\nYou'll like:\n\nThe sense of scale – It's nice to be a part of something bigger.\nThe authenticity poured into the units and weapons.\nThe community is mature and friendly.\n\nYou'll dislike:\n\nThe learning curve may be a little too steep for some.\nVery occasional de-sync between players when facing AI (not an issue when playing against players)\nThe lack of variety in maps – mainly comprising of countryside with a few sparse towns, but there are maps that feature a large city with docks.\n\nRead more over at: http://www.tcxs.co.uk/4/post/2013/08/wargame-airland-battle-review.html\n","November 25, 2013","true","48.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

This sequel to the original game "Wargame: European Escalation" now includes Aircraft such as the F-18, F-16, Tornado, Mig-21 and plenty more, and let me tell you there is nothing short of units in this game. The amount of nations and forces there are in this game make it extremely appealing to me, nations are divided by Pact and Nato then by countrys, currently there are 830 units in the game so there is a lot to chose from. Most of the maps are gigantic sometimes to the point where I am completely confused and overwhelmed because I am unsure what to do with my units but I am new to the game so I'm sure in due time that will pass. All the DLC has been free for both this game and its Wargame: European Escalation so that is definitely a plus, the DLC usually adds in new maps and vehicles. The games vehicles are very well detail in my opinion, taking into consideration the scale of the maps and all the stuff going on, the graphics are excellent to the point where it is kinda eye candy; I feel like good movie clips could be made with this game...\n\nThe Game is updated quite regularly and the developers actually listen to the players through the forums and a third installment is scheduled for release in 2014 and I am personally quite excited for it, from what I have read it will be called "Wargame: Red Dragon" this sequel will include 5 new nations including the Chinese and the North Koreans, over 450 new units including ships, WHAT?! (as if it wasent chaotic enough) and they have also changed the location, this time we are in Central Asia between 1971 and 1991; The version I am really hoping for is a Modern Warfare Version 2000+ era vehicles, planes and such.\n\nIn campaign is set in Europe, mainly around Denmark, Norway and Sweden area. You got back and forth between playing as Nato and Pact, the Campaign has definitely improved from the previous game, for this installment you have sort of a table top surface for the Campaign separating allied controlled blocks and enemy controlled blocks when you are not fighting, but you can do passive things to, like send in recon or bomb a enemy blocks which I actually like. Skirmish mode is a fun and good way to learn how to play the game without getting slaughtered in multiplayer, you are basically battling the computer and you can change the difficulty of the enemy and your allies. Multiplayer is chaotic at first to say the least, especially if its 10v10 it was definitely difficult but I'm sure in a few months I will get used to it.\n\nMaking Custom Decks I believe has improved, you have way more vehicles to chose from then the previous game when you are first starting out and you also get bonuses for certain groups like Mechanized Group, Armor Group, Support Group; also you get bonuses for which time frame you want. You get units from a point system, it goes by how many enemy units you kill and if any of your units have died.\n\nThere is one thing I don't like about this game and that is the game is $40 at the time I am making this, I don't get it because basically it's really just an add-on to the previous Wargame, and really there are not many new features besides, a few new maps, planes and a few new vehicles so I recommend buying this if it is ever on sale, I would say 50% or lower.\n\nMy final verdict is this game puts the "Real" in Real Time Strategy; I enjoy this game I have a lot of fun with it. If you can maintain your units well on the massive maps, you will do fine. The game is very realistic with chaotic war scenarios and epic battles.\n\nCheers \m/\n\nP.S.

It's an RTS, but it's also a reasonably realistic simulation of cold-war warfare. Players who are familiar with usual RTS (Starcraft, et.al.) may find the need to employ real-world tactics a shock (simply trying to overwhelm your opponent with a large number of your hardest-hitting units will not work). On the other hand, players who are more familiar with turn-based, realistic combat simulations (Combat Mission: Shockforce comes into mind) may get overwhelmed by the need to react in realtime. There is no such luxury as contemplating your move for several hours.\n\nPlayers who are neither an RTS nor a turn-based game veterans might be the ones with a slight advantage here. That being said, anybody willing to approach this game with an open mind will be able to start climbing the learning curve. It's a steep curve, I warn you, but with enough patience one might be able to master this game eventually (I certainly haven't!).\n\nIf you are more into multi player games, Wargame: Airland Battle offers a quite robust multiplayer modes. I didn't get to test the multi player modes, however. But from what I've read (almost) everywhere, it's a blast.\n\nWargame: Airland Battle offers a superb 3D game engine, capable of rendering virtually every blade of grass on the battlefield. To be able to appreciate this, though, you'll need to have a powerful PC. Even if you do, however, you might not have the chance to do so because you will be too busy viewing the battlefield from a zoomed-out strategic view rather than zooming in to each of the beautifully modeled (and animated) units.\n\nIn the end, this is not a game to pass if you have an interest in modern (cold-war era) combined arms combat simulation. This is particularly true since the game is now offered at a very affordable price. Just keep in mind that this is not your average RTS, nor is it your typical realistic combat simulation. It is one curious beast, and if you can take it for what it is, you'll have a good time with it.\n\nNote for Mac owners: I have successfully played this game on my old-ish Macbook Pro (2012 13" non retina). I've upgraded the RAM of the MacBook (it's got 8 GB of RAM) and the game ran reasonably well, albeit with mid-to-low graphics settings. It still looks good, but may not be as good as those videos of the game you've been watching on Youtube.","May 7","true","4.7"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","12","19","3","1"

Massive battle(well large depending) look good due to the camera placement allowing the player to survey the entire battlefield and get to witness columns of tanks advancing, artillery shelling targets kilometeres away(BM-21 looks extra awsome) and of course jets firing their combat runs. Lots of units to pick from that are interesting to see used in combat and infantry that er........yeah skip them. Now the game does have resource managment of a sort, every unit has finite fuel, ammo etc. and can be re-equipped at an FOB or a handy truck. Now multipayer is good but what falls completely flat is the "campaign" and to an extent the skirmish mode. This can be sort of fixed by playing with friends but is still painful due to AI oddities. They almost never attack so you constantly have to make the first move and can be crushed due to the moral system which dictates how many units you can use from that army and can leave you with say......1/20 of what your opponent can use. To its credit it makes you not waste any units and think more tacically. So to rap it up sort of fun game that is better with people(as most things are) but falls flat on other modes due to AI difficulties i dunno maybe i am just terrible but that has been my experiance.","September 24, 2014","true","5.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Those who rush into action will quickly find their units dead, armies depleted, and objectives lost. The deck system is an integral part of this, allowing players to create and tailor their decks for specific strategies with a large assortment of units. Want to build a mixed Scandinavian armor deck, or a glorious all-American deck? It's up to you. I've often considered building a deck to be as much of a game as the game itself.\n\nThere is something to be said about watching hundreds of Norwegian tanks heroically charging (and getting slaughtered by) a dug-in Soviet force though :D\n\n","November 25, 2013","true","53.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Wargame doesn't do that, it doesn't demand fast reflexes or min-maxing construction, it requires you to understand unit synergy, positioning and cooperation with your team.\n\nAt the same time this isn't a simulator, concessions have been made to make gameplay more fun. Like the name suggests, Wargame is best described as a virtual miniature war game, giving you the best of tabletop hills and painted tank models without the high price or extremely slow pace.\n\nThe developers themselves are a dedicated bunch, releasing patches on a near-daily basis and listening to community feedback. The previous game, European Escalation, received several packs of free DLC, I expect the same to be with Airland Battle.\n\nThe only letdown is the singleplayer component. While the AI is competent enough it cannot rival a human player, the campaign while fun against another person isn't entertaining enough solo.\n\nThis is a multiplayer game first and foremost, if the idea of fighting 10v10 battles across the sweeping hills of Scandinavia using authentic Cold War weaponry appeals to you then jump right in without hesitation.","July 18, 2013","true","90.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This is not one of those game where you find the "broken unit" and drive everyone insane. Any build can be broken by a counterbuild, and finding a consistantly lethal formation has been extremely difficult, though in time I have learned to build fairly consistent formations. Planes are in and out really fast unless you have good recon! By the time you see them, it is almost always too late to send out your own fighters if you didn't spot them ahead of time. Every unit is strong in certain conditions, weak in others. Swarm tactics can make up for some of this with some units, but rarely is it efficient enough to be reliable.

These are all things that in typical RTSs? Would be the wrong thing to do. As many would say "Gameplay over Realism". Wargame does the opposite in an attempt to prove that even simulations can be fun but unfortunately? It misses just by a hair.\n\nGFX - IRIS Zoom v4 is amazing. It can truely render a lot of detail at any range, making every land scape so wonderous that it's FPS worthy close up, and Hi-Res Sat image worthy from far away. It lacks in the partical department and animations, (which on infantry is down right BAD) but for a game of this scale? It still shines well on max settings.\n\nSFX - Language specific factions and realistic sounding weapons seemingly ripped right from the military recordings. Does well on accuracy but lacks in variety. Units say the same things over and over, just in diferent tounges and explosions all blend together since there is little sound emulation going on; just raw sound being queued on events.\n\nInterface - Needs some work. Once you get the hang of it, it's no big deal but little things like having the Hot Key letter listed some where on the buttons would be great. Also, the Info tabs for each unit would do well to add descriptions of that units militarial role. As it sits right now, massive amounts of research needs to be spent before one plays their first skirmish because unless you're well versed in Cold War era military hard ware and patient enough to read through the Key Binding tabs, you're more or less S.O.L.\n\nGame Play - Simulative, powerul yet lacking. It's a bueatiful game that fudges up very little however; eventually? The lack of "design" begins to show. So much detail seems to be spent on replicating the Cold War era units and maps that little attention has been given to the over all design of the game flow. In short, the polish is lack luster in one major area - Pacing. It's rock solid everywhere else from Soft Counters to Hard Counters to powerful deck building options to rewarding great tream work! But in the end? It's the pacing that I had problems with. The scale of the maps are misleading since the units are designed to be close to realistic; thus having effective ranges that in some cases? can = several miles on their own. When you take that into context, maps are no longer that huge, it's just the units are that small. Battles erupt very easily with little room to actually move since everything is so small that the time it takes to relocate is punishing. Couple this with Air Power and other forms of CAS and bullrushes of powerful air strikes or chopper raids punishes any newer player to dust; and becomes maintstream equivilents of the Starcraft Zerg 6pool builds in higher levels. After studying this strange flaw right after I at least picked up the basics, I concluded that pacing was the oddest ball in the court. You start each battle with a set amount of points to spawn your initial force. After words, it's up to capturing "sectors" to see a trickle of points come in. The issue here is that in large point battle, your first force will be brissling and wonderous; ready to wreack havoc. However once combat starts the slow trickle cannot replace either sides forces at a pace that justifies the start. If points are set low, then the force remains small period since the economic rate never changes; and often these small starting pulls leads to lame rushes anyway. If there was some player control over the rate of income and the ammount of income recieved, games could be set to be more diverse than they are now, all because the pacing is off.\n\nVerdict - Its grande, it's bueatiful and it's accurate. But a gold star game? It's not. It's damned close though. It needs better pacing options and greater player control over game play types for diversity. Add these and this would be my replacement for all things RTS. With that said? I'd recommend this game to any all hard core RTS gamers. It is like World In Conflic mixed with Total War in terms of mechanics. Just know that its better as a Sim than it is an Arcade game.","December 28, 2013","true","15.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Playing this game with your friend(s), with matching deck is really fun\n\ndefinitely recommended\n+ long range fighting - finally you can fight on longer ranges then in other RTS (which are usually tens or max. hundreds\nof meters)\n\n+ super high number of units (plenty of variants and sub variants, especially for wide-spread units like T-72 or Leopard 1)\n\n+ modern armour - one of few RTS games without Tigers, Shermans, etc\n\n+ national deck - unlike in European Escalation, now you can built a fully functional national deck for each nation while\nselecting a national deck provides quite significant advantages - more activation points, unlocked prototypes, but units\nfrom other nations will be locked\n\n+ deck optimization - apart from choosing nation, you can also choose which type of deck you wish to play (mechanized,\narmoured, navy, para....), this will upgrade some of your units (veterancy, decrease of activation points required) while\nsome units will be unavailable and some slots might be locked for example: Armoured = more veterancy for tanks, tanks cost less activation points, but you will loose 6 slots in "infantry" section\n\n+ planes (of course) - great number of types, roles and ammunition (including some nasty things like cluster bombs, napalm\netc.)\n\n+ better AA - now you need to plan your AA defence much more precisely - radar guided missile are better against planes (but you must keep an eye on anti-radar planes), IR rockets against helicopters etc. only by combining all kinds of AA (radar\nrockets, IR rockets and guns) and proper positioning you can provide safe space for your ground units\n\n+ supply lines - with new patch, providing supplies for your units is more challenging then before (an very much more\nchallenging then in W:EE)\n\n+ campaigns - there are for campaigns (each of different length), all located in Scandinavia, they are pretty good and is\nalso possible to play them in multi player (as coop and versus)\n\n+ quite good support from developer, nice community around game\n\n\n- great number of units can confuse new players plus "national names" of units are not much of help (Norwegian or Swedish\nunits, mainly infantry)\n\n- arty - in W:AB arty fires in salvoes, which are pretty fast so each battery containing more then 2 guns now feel almost\nlike a multiple rocket launcher - it makes arty more effective, but looks weird and quite unrealistic\n\n- learning curve - it will take some time to get familiarized with all units, their advantages and weaknesses and proper use\n\n- ranked matchmaking not working - it seems ranked games are not much popular, so you will get any oponent that is avaible no matter his rank\n\n- too much napalm (and other spams) - almost every nation has a napalm bomer and often you get spammed by cheap napalm bomers, there are some other units which are spammed from time to time (certain helicopters etc)\n\n- price is quite high after long time, but with discount (sales) it is a great deal","November 28, 2013","true","69.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The campaign mode made me buy this game and not Company of Heroes (which lacks such a mode). I did not regret it. It is not an easy game to get into and I prefere WWII but Cold War is also not bad and the game is very realistic (line of sight, realistic strength/weaknesses of units, logistic considerations, etc...). I only played it for 9 hours but I'm already hooked.

There is a feast of strategy features to behold here: hundreds of units, a variety of different game modes, and unique pacing that rewards the patient, tactical mind. Players can choose from a list of prebuilt armies or "decks", or can build their own deck to suit their needs. In game, units are deployed via reinforcement zones that must be captured by having a "control vehicle" unit sitting somewhere on it. Battles are fought on a scale meant to represent an entire theater of operations. So basically there can be a ton of units on the screen or just a few, but the camera can zoom in and out accordingly. In addition to the good camera tech, the game looks gorgeous and scales well for lower powered machines. Highly recommended for any RTS fan who's tired of the extreme fast paced action of Starcraft or DotA, and doesn't have enough time to invest in the much slower ones like AoE and Sins of a Solar Empire.","December 26, 2013","true","102.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I love this airland battle even more because in European Escalation ive always wanted airplanes / jets in the game and now finally am loving this game! I love using the A-10 thunderbolt II and hearing the gattling gun sound when it takes down its target such a badass and nice feeling and awesome to watch! I can see myself putting 80+ hours into this game double what Ive put into Wargame: European Escalation just because of the added airplanes / jets feature! Wargame Airland Battle is better played with your friends etc.. I love playing skrimish mode with my friends against AI its very nice and very fun and enjoyable then its good to do 1v1 against your friends also good feeling! then once we are done that we would team up against other players online and win yay!\n\nId highly recommend this game if you've ever played Wargame: European Escalation or even if you havn't id still recommend this airland battle over Wargame: European Escalation anytime!\n\nMy Score: 8.5/10","December 28, 2013","true","12.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I am a major historian myself, and the units in this game are all extremely accurate, right down to the last infantryman and what he has to bring to combat. The models are done really well, and the mechanics are extremely realistic. An example of this is the tank on tank combat when one tank fires at another. Instead of just always blowing up, the tank that is hit could have a computer system malfunction or a track blown off. I'll admit that the Campaign could be a bit better, but the tactics and strategy (which is what an RTS game is all about) is OUTSTANDING.","December 15, 2013","true","42.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's awesome because it forces decisions at the tactical, operational and stategic levels of gameplay based on how deckbuilding has been refined and how airpower comes into play at the operational level. The game has its flaws sure, mostly in terms of how well trained infantry can't use 40 javelin rockets to kill a single chopper sometimes.\n\nThis game reminds you of what a commander at battalion level would be thinking, such as making worthy tradeoffs like 16 points of infantry to take out a 40 point T-55 tank or a 105 point MiG-21 and so forth. Making worthy sacrifices and ensuring that no loss goes unjustified makes this game great and it is an all round improvement on European Escalation, which is an already great game.\n\nVisually the game looks and runs beautifully at a smooth 60 FPS on a 550Ti on maxed everything, there is no pop in and the texture swapping is seamless and unnoticable and textures of units and the environment also all hold up very well under very close scruitiny, allowing you pick out the details of the battlefield in glorious 1080p.","December 30, 2013","true","84.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Fortunately, Eugen's sequel, Wargame: Red Dragon, provides time controls and is a far better single player experience, and well worth a look.\n\nHowever, for a fun, tactical MP RTS it shows a lot of potential and well worth a look.  It's just not my thing, and the game is advertised as both single-player and multi-player, and I'm reviewing this for it's SP content, which is lacking, and not near as "impressive in solo play" as the marketing suggests.  It's not terribly, mind, but the inability to give orders while paused, and the requirement of most maps to maintain multiple axes of advance, just turns it into yet another arcade RTS clickfest, cancelling out the benefit of what are very good underlying unit and combat models.","December 2, 2014","false","2.6"," 23 of 44 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","23","44","0","0"

In the multiplayer you can pick one of two sides, NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization), then you have the Pact (Warsaw Pact). Between both sides you have a total of 12 countries to choose vehicles and infantry units (these categories have been broken down from the game [Logistics, Infantry, Support, Tank, Recon, Vehicle, Helo (helicopters), Planes]). With 800+ units to choose from, between both Pact and NATO, this game makes a great RTS.\n\nNow for the cons, where this game is great and all, what I noticed through my time playing Wargame is that people love to camp artillery at the back of the map and spam it all over. This really annoys me quite a bit when I'm trying to play. Another thing to bring up is the plane spam (I don't like to take sides, but usually it's NATO who is spamming the planes, I'm not saying Pact does not, I'm only saying it is usually NATO). I think that this makes a quite large pain for when trying to play logistically, and playing it as a strategy game like it is supposed to. Not many cons besides those two pains, the spamming of artillery and spamming of planes.\n\nOverall I love this game, it was, and is a great game!\n\n[9.3/10] - Fun and well-made campaign.\n[9.6/10] - Well-made multiplayer\n[9.5/10] - Model Design\n[9.9/10] - Visual FX\n[9.9/10] - Audio FX\n[9.1/10] - Realism\n[9.3/10] - Glitches (High is good)\n[9.7/10] - Entertainment\n[9.5/10] - Unpredictability\n[9.8/10] - Overall fun\n\nRATING {95.6/100}","February 21, 2014","true","312.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is much more complex than something like Command and Conquer, and you need to be quite strategic in your strategies. You need to keep your units balanced, so just sending in a ton of tanks won't win the battle for you.\n\nThe aircraft, AAA, SAMs, and choppers add a lot to the game too. (I absolutely love killing planes with hidden SAM trucks. Boom!) Transporting infantry is well implemented. And then the units. 800+ units from all different countries, all well modeled and animated.\n\nThe gameplay is difficult, but rewarding, and is fun to master.

(I absolutely love killing planes with hidden SAM trucks. Boom!) Transporting infantry is well implemented. And then the units. 800+ units from all different countries, all well modeled and animated.\n\nThe gameplay is difficult, but rewarding, and is fun to master.

I personally like playing against AI, either by myself or with friends.  The main thing that can kind of ruin the fun in the game is how command units are required to hold sectors; regardless if you have multiple platoons in the sector or not, if the commander unit is destroyed even by a single air strike, you've lost control of the sector and no longer gain benefits from it until another command unit is within that sector.  This makes the game focus more on hunting command units, rather than encouraging you to use strategies to overcome the enemy's forces.\n\nI bought this game for $40 when it first came out, but it doesn't really feel like a game worth that much.  However, for $20, it's definitely worth it if you like this kind of stuff.","May 24, 2014","true","53.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Create decks full of military units from different eras, ranging from post-WWII up to the Cold War, and take your pick of categories all the way from light recon vehicles, to infantry, helicopters and planes, tanks, artillery and mortars, logistics, and everything in between. You can truly have some epic moments with this game, especially when playing with friends, and despite it's initial learning curve for players new to the genre, you can still have mega amounts of entertainment. I am still not the greatest at Wargame, but sending in a line of Leopard 2A4's with flanking support of AH-1F Cobra's, while a barrage of artillery rains down on your opponents infantry divisions, is guaranteed to make you happy. With Red Dragon, the next installment in the Wargame series on the way, it means that even more units will be added, but buying both AB and RD will not be a regret.","February 26, 2014","true","73.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Massive improvement over the previous "European Escalation", both in terms of singleplayer and multiplayer.\n\nIt's definitely not babby's first RTS/RTT, because this kind of aims at a niche market. Clumping your units together and giving an attack/move order will never work, and the scale of the battles is absolutely enormous (only thing I can think of bigger would be Total Anihilation, or the first Supreme Commander).\n\nThere's also a huge focus on creating battlegroups, and selecting the unit type good for the job, so expect to spend many hours browsing through the 700+ units in the game.\n\nBest strategy game of the year, especially after a really disappointing Company of Heroes 2.","July 23, 2013","true","68.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The fact you're allowed to control Joint-Ops in the air and on the ground is awesome as it already is. A very wide range of units to choose from, each mission has its own form of approach on how to take your enemy down. Every unit has a counter measure, even the fastest of jets and the strongest of tanks may find themselves put down but what might appear to be the least expected unit to be thrown against them. This game takes into mind many aspects such as recon, armour penetration, accuracy, morale and even on-field errors and setbacks such as an Optical Failure or a track breaking loose, hampering the movement or accuracy of a tank or vehicle. Not even Helicopters or Jets are safe from the dangers of on-field setbacks.","March 13","true","18.9"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

The menu design in-game is similar, along with the awesome zooming capabilities, well it is built on the same game engine.\n\nThis game is more realistic though, vehicles have fuel and ammunition which can run out who then need to be resupplied. Logistics is something you have to keep in mind. Quite fun though, my ATGMs needed to be replenished so I sent in a supply helicopter, couple of AAs opened up with missiles but luckily they all missed!\nLogistics can get stressed as well. A forward advance involves a lot of shooting and ammo is being used, keeping the units resupplied turns into a challenge. Supply trucks take time to reach the front so many times I've had to resupply with heavy lift choppers. And as the advance moves along the supply line gets even more stretched; that's why capturing sectors from which reinforcements can arrive is important.\n\nThere's also a cool feature where you can actually turn off a specific weapon on a unit so it only fires ones which are on. So if I don't want my Apache to use it's Hellfire I can turn it off and it'll only use it's auto-cannon and unguided rockets.\n\nPeople say the game has a high learning curve which is true but If you like strategy you'll get a hang of it.\n\nMultiplayer is still active but not too much. Red Dragon might be more active.","January 8","true","547.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Besides that I love every part of this game, being a military nut I love the depth this game has and how accurately it depicts the growth of weaponry for a cold war that got a bit hotter. Retaining things like small arms development and changing things that do not fit the timeline. The deck system is a favorite of mine since I love creating my own decks in card games and making something unique that can be tweaked to perfection. This is my first military RTS so I cannot give opinions on most of the gameplay, but the idea of a 1-10v1-10 really makes me feel like I'm controlling joint combined arms operations in World War III. Eugen has made an amazing game - that, so far - I love.","December 29, 2015","true","17.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's got somewhat of a steep learning curve.  I would consider this game to be an rts simulator.  I really enjoyed ruse which is one of it's predecessors.  You need to supply your units with ammo and fuel using supply trucks.  You will need to learn the statistics of all 900 units to be any good at this game.  It was a quick learn for me because I've always loved military jets, tanks and weapons.  Very much the opposite of a starcraft or warcraft type game because you can just build a million units and send them in and expect to do well.  The game plays like ruse but is much more sophisticated.  I also own the next installment called Red Dragon however I think Red Dragon needs a bit more polish, balance and bug fixing to do before I could recommend that game.  The layer of dust on my company of heros games will forever thicken due to the release of this game.  Also I should make mention of the fact you can play with units between 1950's and 1980's.  Playing with older units are cheaper and more abundant while newer units are far more sparce, expensive and effective.  spectacular game.\n\n\nnew update--  nope,  recent update make skirmish unplayable like red dragon.  1 easy opponent destroys 3 medium allies.  within 2 mins of skirmish screen is flooded with enemy and there is nothing you can do to win.  Spams all units and defeat is always enevitable.","June 19, 2014","false","373.0"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

Set in the Cold War era, this highly tactical RTS pits NATO and the Warsaw Pact against each other in large scale epic battles.\n\nThe mulitplayer is incredibly fun with matches that range from 1v1 to 10v10 (and let me tell you, 10v10 battles are chaotic!). This is a game where unit spam is not a viable option. You have to carefully study the units in the armory when creating your "decks" (these are armies you can make in the game that you bring with you into battles). The deck customization itself is impressive. The maps are huge but vary in size depending on the amount of players. This game requires that you put some time into it, but when you do, you will be rewarded with great victory.\n\nI highly recommend this game. I have had nothing but fun since I started playing.

I'd really recommend it for any of you big military commanders out there, me being one of those good old warhammer tabletop commanders fell in love with the Wargame games especially this one as it combines fast paced RTS with the "realistic" elements of the military world.\n\nBut be warned, this game is no where near easy and it can be hard to pick up at times, its best to experiment with different "decks" and try new things all the time. I for one am quite patriotic and end up sticking with my UK deck a lot but there will be times when I just want to start another rivalry with one of my friends so I'll jump over to the pact side!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GnrlGrad/recommended/222750/","GnrlGrad","th0ma5","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GnrlGrad/","153 products in account","This game is a very good rts that requires quite a bit of tactical play as well as strategy and unlike more traditional rts games this game focuses more on tactics than actions-per-minute or unit spamming.\n\nBefore each battle you must select a deck of units which you can customise to suit your play style. Initially it is a bit overwhelming because of the sheer amount of units to choose from so it's best to start with any custom deck and fine tune it after every battle as you learn more. Eventually you could have different decks to suit different strategies and maps. It's a lot of fun creating a deck, previewing the units and checking out their stats.\n\nThe graphics and effects are amazing but during a battle you probably won't get much chance to see them in all their glory. However if you win a good game make sure to play back the replay and you can view the action up close and personal.\n\nMultiplayer seems to be where this game is at it's best and although a lot of the player base seems to have moved onto it's successor Red Dragon you can still get a game in most times. There are also single player campaigns and a skirmish play mode too. Overall I would recommend this game.\n\n","August 4, 2015","true","53.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's just a lot of little things that pile up. One big thing that I hate is the distribution of delopyment points. Sometimes it's good, other times not so much. Another thing is if you move two divisions into the same sector as one enemy divison, you do not get the benefit of units and deployment points from both divisions. Aparently there is no such thing as a tag team in this game, because apparently war is a fair fight.\n\nAlso I've only ever played on easy mode. YES. EASY. As in the game is enough to kick your butt and make you angry on EASY MODE. Every other game I play I start at normal. I've never purposefully started on easy mode until this series. Now I have won some campaigns. But there is a difference between winning and having fun. Sometimes you put some much work into winning that it just becomes a chore. That's probably just me though. I think I would get more pleasure from playing a difficult level of Talos Principle and winning compared to this game.","December 23, 2015","false","10.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","1"

After trying Age of Empires, World in Conflict and Supreme Commander type games I never considered myself a great fan of having to rush building units, dashing them to the front line and then endlessly mass firing at enemies who are doing the same thing.\n\nBut this game is nothing like that!\n\nThere is real strategy involved in scouting out areas with Gazelle helicopters and Warrior scouts before sending in your MTBs and infantry. I love the way the armour and penetration are protrayed - you can see the shells bouncing off the Abrams hull armour.

It has a, "Total War: 1985" feeling to it, as it shares a lot of characteristics with total war, but with a higher learning curve. And not just some, "Oh, new game. Better see what to do," its like dumping all of your experience in other games to adapt to this one. It is a very confusing game at first, and a lot would not get into the game at all. But for some RTS lovers, like me, it would be a strategical fiasco of combat. With so many units, and with soooo many stats for the units, its a very balanced game. You got tanks, that can be countered by airplanes, which could be countered by AA, which could be countered by infantry, which could be countered by helicopter, which could be countered by AA, which is countered by tanks. You get the gist. It has a very big, rock, paper, scissors, feel to it as you play.

It looks like reailistic just on the skin ( with all detailed unit types ), but at the end it is just crazy run like C&C Generals or Starcraft.  Very bad THERE IS NO PAUSE or no time control unlike in other serious strategy games. It is almost impossible to manage so many units with detailed micro management required ( puting them to bush ). At the end it is not about tactis, but just about clicking fast enought to keep paste with computer :(. There is also no save in tactical battles. I think European Escalation was much better.\n\nFrom technical point of view there is also problem in Linux with nVidia GPUs, which cause the game to freeze.

I dont like the 20 min time limit on battles, but it means you get to play more battles, and if you mess up badly it doesnt have a catstophic impact on your overall campaign. The pace is a little fast, but once you get the hang it feels natural. Its a very rewarding game, there is nothing better than watching you prefect plan unfold and smash the will and morale of the enemy.

I was in love with the game when i first bought it. I loved the aspects like the even more detailed deck making system without penalties for new players (in ee you had to unlock all the units). I could spend more time in the decks than in the game itself just by hesitating on the best units to take in. There came the airplanes, and the mountanious, not geometrically perfect, fancy looking maps were added once again, after 4 years, like it was in R.U.S.E.. There are even more detailed vehicles, and they amount to 700-800. Everything what was realistic in european escalation, is even more realistic here. And yeah, the look of the maps has FAAAAAAAR more variety than in the previouss serie. These are the positives, and i still like them.\n\nBut! I am a veteran R.U.S.E., and european escalation player, I almost played just multiplayer in these games, and won lot of rounds, and also lose at least the same amount. In airland battle I first came to multi, as the singleplayer is FAAAR from the fun in mp (I just you know played it like a tutorial not to be extremely lame). I then came up to multi, built my first deck, and started my first game. WOW i won that. I love games where I start with feeling of success. Then came the next rounds. Lost. Lost. Lost. Lost. Eh thats too. Okay, i built a more logical deck. Then lost again, and again. I stopped playing it for some days, then tried again, and nothing. I have been doing that till this article, and it SUCKS BALLS. I never had a day where I won more than I lost, and there are days where there aren't any victories! I always try to make the new decks, new tactics, and never manage to win!\n\nSo I hate that almost all russian tanks have this ♥♥♥♥in AT rocket. I hate the planes, because i hate ALL kinds of aircraft, as they ruin my game even if I make AA rockets, AA planes and even AA helis! I hate that you always start with a maximum of 1000 (1500?) dollars, and if you do not fear enough, you are wiped out from the map and you can do nothing in the other half of the game. I dont know, why, but i cannot win in this game.","February 21, 2014","false","52.9"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","1"

I honestly feel like im back in the arcade world, where nothings fair or even close to "realistic". You have only 20mins no matter what you plan on doing to start, deploy and conquer the entire map, which is the complete opposite of what I thought these games and "war" itself were all about. On top of that the actual structure of the unit combat doesn't even make sense? You can completely lose the entire unit filled with 100's of vehicles by simply placing your command unit in the wrong place before the battle starts. The AI is also unbelievably aggressive and attacks with what seems like every unit in the game in the first 2mins. That combined with the completely ridiculous "moral" and "initiative" systems that make no sense, this game is not a realistic rts simulator anymore.

It is really cool in the fact that the units are realistic and it could be really cool except for one simple fact....... you don't fight the computer and you don't fight other human players. You fight against the awful interface. If you don't have nine hands and play starcraft like you're a south korean you are hopelessly doomed. How in the world is one person supposed to control a whole brigade worth of assets at the same time. The AI does nothing for you but sit there and die. If you are a micromanging master this game will appeal to you. If you want to test real strategy on a micro or macro level forget about it. I will never buy another game from this company until they make the players units do more for you. What is the point of a scout who doesn't call for fire? An anti air asset who sits behind the trees and can't shoot and won't move to a position that will.

Dont get me wrong I love the concept of a Cold war rts but its VERY poorly executed in this game. Let me provide examples: 1. Special Forces are completely unrealistic as  they are apparently (according to the game) Indestructable to Tanks, Napalm, Arterly, and other Infantry( with the exception of other spec ops)  2. Recon makes no sense whatsoever as the Spetsnaz VMF (a two man squad) has a higher chance of being spotted than a squad of five Razvedka division. Also on the topic of recon lets talk about the broken recon helicopter system  as the statistics make no sense whatsoever. This can be easily shown through the optics section of a units description (in this case I’m using the Soviet mi-2 as an example) the mi-2 has optics of very good  but how is one to compute the words very good  into actually game play? I don't know,as it does not give the player a accurate sight listing (ex: optics up to 10,00 meters etc) 3. Helicopter spam: This is probably the most annoying flaw about this broken game  as this happens IN EVERY SINGLE GAME people can simply spam helicopters (and not uses any strategy while doing it)  and literally destroy everything while doing (including anti aircraft) 4. Anti Aircraft   : The aa system  algorithm in this game is surely the worst I’ve seen in my entire life as certain planes are literally untouchable by anti aircraft again let me provide more examples from the game. In a particular match I had 6 zsu-23 afghanskii which altogether have a fire rate of 5,454r/m and a Tunguska system  right beside them. then a lone f -14 tomcat comes along and take NO DAMAGE from the Tunguska and the six  afghanskis  and as to be expected this is continuous from game to game no matter what aa system I use on either pact of nato  it will rarely take down aircraft.  5. Forest Combat : fighting in a forest in this game is being realistic as it basically becomes like harry potter. Basically a squad of 40 motostrelki disappears magically from my 60 US marines, and when I do get sights back on them is says “no clear sight”  which is absolutely ridiculous  given that the forest aren't very large in most maps. Final Verdict: Only but this game if its ion sail never pay full price for it as its utter garbage to anyone who has respect for this genre of games.

The single player is a different story...\nFirst off, the AI cheats.  I am talking about a "zero fog of war" senario for the AI.  It may not be able to blind fire on your units, but it will send a worthless one point truck out towards one of your hidden units.  This will occur seemingly without fail.  While I can accept this happening every once in a while due to blind luck, this happens EVERY TIME I try to send spec ops. behind enemy lines.  That thenpaves the way for every aircraft in the pact's arsenal to drop half the planet's stockpile of bombs on my units.\nNext, the AI spams.  As in, it will spam T-55s and BTR by the hundreds, while I, if I were playing pact, would be unable to field 20.  My units only have so much ammo and can only fire so fast.  They will almost always get overrun just by sheer numbers.  When playing the AI, it becomes less of an RTS and more of a tower defense, "Spam everything you've got," game.\nThen there is the lack of intelligent AI in your own units.  I want to be maing strategic plays, not frantically telling every radar guided AA gun to turn off its radar to avoid being destroyed by a SEED (suppression of enemy air defense) aircraft, or telling an unarmed recon hellicopter to get its a-- out of a Tungustka's (Russian made AA gun) range.  For the enemy AI though, its a different story.  After all, when you can make 3.7 billion computations a second, its pretty easy to micromanage every unit.\n\nAs said above, when you are playing multiplayer, its a differnt story.  Yes, unfortunatly you do still have to micromanage every unit you have.  But so does your opponent.  And they are not micromanageing unitsat a rate of 3.7 billion a second.\nThis game has an unparalleled level of depth for a "game" RTS (i.e. not Command.)  Armored Vehlicals (Steam really needs spell check :)) have varying armor thicknesses based on where a shot hits.  (Front, side rear, top.)  Infantry can hide in forests and towns, making ambushes a snap.  Fuel and ammo is limited with logistic vehlicals (once again, I need spell check) resupplying your units.  You have full control over your aircraft while they are over the battlefield, if you tell them otherwise, they will NOT fly a straight line to thier target (not recommended as AA will likely shoot them down.)  Your units are irreplacable.  Although you can reinforce, your reinforcements are not unlimited.  There are so many features in this game that I would likely need to type five pages to list all the features in this game.\n\nWould I recommend this game?  That depends.\nSingle player: HELL NO.  This is an exercise in frustration with the amount of AI cheating present.\nMultiplayer: Absoultly.  This is a well made RTS game that, IMO should be just as famous as Starcraft or C&C.","February 2, 2015","true","205.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Namely, get immediately annhilated fighting the Easy AI.\n\nAnyway, after a few disastrous adventures on the Highway to Oslo map, one comes to realize this game has more than meets the eye. And what meets the eye is impressive in itself: sprawling maps teeming with bridges, towns, ports, highways, rivers, hills, forests, farms,  all of which you can examine from ground level and, after a seamless mouse-wheel swoop, from a few thousand feet up. I can watch my jet fighters ducking through AA tracer fire again and again (in slow motion, no less, courtesy of the game saving a replay of every single match).\n\nI like this game.

With that being said I will no longer be playing it as there is a glitch where my screen keeps scrolling all the way in and when I pan out it quickly falls back to ground level and then pans across the map. Anyone that plays this game pretty much knows that in order to be effective at controlling the units you need to spend a majority of your time a great distance above the action in order to have a real understanding of what is happening on the field of battle. I am truly disappointed and will be checking for a fix or a refund. Do not let this stop you from getting the game though as talking to others in the in game chat this problem is seems to be unique to me as far as I can tell but it makes the game frustrating to the point of unplayability.","October 15, 2014","true","83.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The atmosphere of each battle is unique thanks to the large number of unit combinations (deck) that you can bring to the frontline to support your particular style of fighting.\n\nI miss a little the story campaigns of the previous Wargame: European Escalation, but dynamic campaign on global map of whole Scandinavian peninsula with CO-OP more than compensates for it.\n\nPvP multiplayer is core game feature that will put you way beyond 100 hour game time especially with the supported 10vs10 battles which allows for a unique RTS experience (and also very accessible to variously skilled players).\n\nIn summary this is one RTS that shouldn't be missed as it really is a fresh wind to the classical RTS scene.","November 27, 2013","true","217.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game has two factions in which these nations reside: the Warsaw Pact and NATO. While the nations aren't balanced both sides can still win by exploiting the weaknesses of the other nation and the terrain. Much like in real war.  For example Norwegian armor cannot stand against the armor of the USSR, but with clever tactics they can lead the Soviet tanks into a trap where advanced anti tank missile launchers turn them into scrap metal. This is a game of tactics and possitioning where the best strategy wins over the unprepared.

Not so much in the battles themselves, but in designing army types. From armoured columns to air forces, the customisation of your "deck" of units is mind boggling.\n\nThe battles in and of themselves are simple enough in their objectives, however the outcome will depend heavily on tactical thinking. Classic military strategy pays dividends, using infrantry and support (be it artillery in the form of rockets, howitzers and mortars, or light vehicles) as an anvil, and MBT's, ground attack aircraft and assault helicopters as the hammer. However, the incredible variety of units can be used to great effect in less conventional ways. Inserting commando squads (which vary by the 12 nations) to systematically remove your enemies' anti-air capabilities, followed by saturation carpet bombing by low level attack planes, can be very effective.\n\nIn the end, the tactics of each player will vary wildly depending on thier choice of units and nation.\n\nAs for the games requirements and such:\n\nA touch of a memory hog, though there is a lot of game here. Not too hard to run in very pretty settings, and easy to pick up and play, assuming you have some grasp of military tactics and equipment. A good singleplayer experience to be sure, but the game shines most in multiplayer, when coordinating with your allies in calculated joint attacks.\n\nBetter than most, Wargame is a solid RTS, well worth buying, especially if on sale.","October 11, 2014","true","12.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unlike normal RTS, wargame has a much higher learning curve, and focuses more on tactics than skill.\n\nThe game is based on real life military modern warfare, and comprises of over 700 units based on real life counterparts, belonging to nations such as the US, the USSR and over other 10 nations.\n\nThe general gameplay is put onto 2 main gamemodes: Destruction and conquest. In destruction, the goal is to be the most efficient in destroying your opponents units. Each unit in the game will cost a certain amount of points that will increase over time base on how many areas you have captured with command units. Destroying the unit will give you the points of the units cost. More expensive units are much more powerful, but expensive also. In conquest, players rush to capture areas of the battlefield that will start increasing a point meter. The first player who reach the max points win, hence the gamemode focuses on offence. Utilize units that specializes in certain roles to counter the enemy units. There are 7 roles: logistics, infantry, recon, tanks, support, vehicles, helicopters and planes. A balance in all of these roles are required to be versatile.\n\nGameplay starts in the tutorial, while it gets you introduced and started to the game, it does little to fully equip you with the knowledge to play competently. The game includes both campaign, skirmish and the multiplayer, in the campaign, the game puts you in the scenario of the cold war, where you will lead either the NATO, or the warsaw PACT faction into victory against each other.\n\nYou will be able to deploy troops from different nation to take over areas of the battlefield, where each fight will pit you in a 1v1 against the AI enemy troops. There are  very little long term objectives that is timed, and you will need to rush at it in order to complete it. Extra abilities can be used to reduce the effectiveness of the enemy troops before each fight is started.\n\nIn the skirmish, you can set the rules for the match against the AI from 1v1 to up to 4v4, being a good place to practice for the multiplayer.\n\nIn multiplayer is where this game is at its best. Against players in 1v1 to 10v10 matches, you will be able to test you tactics and experience the brutality of this game. Using fully customized 'decks', you will be engrossed in spending time to craft you decks, reading stats after stats of the over 700 units to try to pick the best units for a balanced situation, while also making sure you can afford the cost of each units.\n\nThe game includes other side content, like replaying a match, a rather small progression system for ranked games and an armory, where you will be able to view all the units in the game available. As stated, this game includes deck customization.\n\nGraphically, the game looks gorgeous, maps are based on farmlands, villages, mountains, large crop fields and small food factories. Thick forest and valleys spread the area. Maps are large, and can go to more than 50km wide. Each military unit looks very similar to their real life counter parts, and a filled with a large amounts of detail. Explosion and gunfire sounds very realistic and immersive. A powerful computer is required to play the game on maxed out graphics.\n\nNow here are some of the downsides, mostly including balancing. As the game focuses much on the 700+units in the game, extensive balancing has been done, unfortunately it is not enough. The tutorial only teaches you how to play the game of the mechanics only, it does not have any advance tips to even get you winning your first campaign mission on easy. In the campaign, it does not offer any sort of story besides the cold war plot, the gameplay is rather repetitive and it does not differ much than regular battles. As objectives has time limits, you cannot take a slow approach to the campaign. Campaigns last long, but only because each fight is repetitive, do not expect a full on campaign.\n\nThe game focuses a lot on the multiplayer, with a high learning curve, hence casual player who loves military games will probably enjoy the skirmishes or campaign, but not the multiplayer, unless you are ok with losing. This game can also easily make you angry or extremely annoyed or irritated, especially in the multiplayer, do not play this if you are easily affected emotionally. In fact, if you are a casual player intending to play the game for military fun and not for competitiveness, you might want to pass on this game, while the insane graphics and appealing mordern military machines with realistic gunfire may be very appealing, this game may be abit too hard to play. Unfortunately, this is one of the only RTS with a modern military warfare theme.\n\nAs you play more and more in the multiplayer you will realize some frustrating units that are rather unfair for their cost, or is very hard to counter in many situations. As the game is based on the statistics of real life units, the more advanced units are generally given to NATO, while the PACT suffers from problems like reduced accuracy and lesser tactical units. For example, the USA of the NATO offers the F117-NightHawk where it is equipped with a laser guided bomb, added to a very stealthy plane, it is difficult to detect and the night hawk can launch its bomb swiftly, with almost 100% accuracy and leave the area fast before it becomes vulnerable to Anti-Air units. There is currently no counterpart of this unit for the PACT, giving the NATO an advantage. The game seems to balance the PACT side with units focusing on more offensive tactics. However this is rather redundant. Wargame includes many realistic factors during gameplay, this includes accuracy, morale, line of sight, being harder to fire on the move , spotting units with recon, heavy cover and others. Because of this, competitive gameplay in normal matches usually boils down to very defensive gameplay. If both sides decides to play defensively, matches can get very boring and frustrating. As both sides do not want to lose units and give points to the enemy team, it is more effective to wait and camp at and area for the enemy to come, giving you advantages like being in cover, firing first, and good positioning. This is enough to even deter what other RTS usually does to counter such a tactic, which is to overwhelm the enemy with a large force. New players will find themselves wondering how their large tank battalions got destroyed by tanks in the forest, a hail of guided missiles and infantry in towns, without even taking a scratch. Entering matches with no time limits against competent players, and you will find the match being endless, until one side decides to attack, which will result in the loss of the game, making high level gameplay extremely frustrating.\n\nWhile Wargame: Airland battle suffers much from balancing issues, there is still much fun to be gained, teaming up with your friends and pitting yourselves against AI can still be alot of fun. Wargame is also one of the very few RTS to focus on modern warfare, with very good graphics, sound and a whole lot of units, this is one of the great games for any military junkie. At the time of review, a sequel has already come out, red dragon, the sequel has fixed a lot of the balancing issue while adding even more units, maps and naval gameplay to the franchise. If you can get either, get red dragon, if not, you still won't be let down with this game, but do not expect a very balanced multiplayer against veterans. Most of the community has also shifted to red dragon. If you plan to get both, you can use Airland battle as a practice to get yourself started to this franchise, if not, you can pass on this as you will not miss much as compared to Wargame: Red Dragon.\n\nWith its rather unique RTS style of modern warfare, gorgeous graphics and sound, and enjoyable explosive packed gameplay, this games earns an 8/10.","August 9, 2014","true","275.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This isnt warcraft you need to know your units abilities befor sending it into battle. Planes are weak and exensive just like in real life (ofc). Tanks are expensive but can take alot of damage. infantry can hide and wait for the enemy to come to them. As of another game made by Eugen called Wargame Red Dragon you get 3 types of units. Sea, air, and land which makes gameplay a whole lot more challenging. 9/10 (The players can be trolls :L)","August 10, 2014","true","149.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It throws a ton of information at you though, and the learning curve is about as steep as Eve Online, but otherwise it's a great RTS. Definitely far above the "casual" arena, though. You're not building bases and zerg rushing. You're trying to inflict casualties while minimizing your own, and then capturing the territory in-between. Sounds cool and all, but be ready for 1-2 hour long games as sometimes that back-and-forth can become a knock down drag out fight.\n\nDefinitely play the tutorials, and definitely play SP before attempting MP.

Hundreds of units were added, jets are now available, 4 new countries.\n\nThe game feels a lot more balanced and intricate while remaining captivating and intense. The suspense really builds and pays off every game, whether a victory or defeat. The multiplayer campaign has kept me up all night, in a 7 hour straight-through session. The campaign map is simple, easy to read, and visually appealing. NATO and Pact forces have unique abilities to take the upperhand in a battle.\n\nAll in all this installment has proven very capable and engaging.

Not nearly enough user control over game mechanics in options.  It's great you can turn the time limit off... but it doesn't help with the points system kicks in and gives the AI adversery a win.  Entirely unrealistic.  No... I don't mean unrealistic as in combat.  I mean, when you have taken all but the AI enemy's last zone, you have an awesome attack group set up for a final assault, but the AI plinks up enough points to end the battle with only a couple of units left.\n\nSome very annoying other things.  Inability to attach units to units.  This would be very helpful for those wonderful moments you realize all your AAA (and various other units) has been killed because they took a short cut straight through enemy territory. Would be resolved if you had the option to pick deployment zones. Then there's the odd way YOUR aircraft manage to EVAC right over enemy AAA, oftien right over thier FOB, amost every time. And lets not forget how effortlessly an enemy aircraft machine-guns tanks to death, manage to avoid your anti-air units all while your own aircraft get knocked down by anything that bothers to shoot at them.

There is no basebuilding, you get points in the start of the match and you call in units with those points. Game has awesome mechanics for cover, buildings and all sorts of other cool terrain features.\n\nIn Airland battle there is also addtion of planes into the series.\n\nGreat game if you like something like world in conflict, ground control (and even maybe some steelpanther). when you can overcome the relative ''high'' learning curve (ie. keep your tanks fueled and ammo flowing) you get a awesome RTS with high replayability. There is also an dynamic gampaing for co-op, singleplayer or versus modes, in which you battle over scandinavia.","February 21, 2014","true","53.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
