SOMA isn't perfect, but once the screen fades to black for the last time it makes up for any deficit. It sets an impossible standard for most indie developers.\n\nThis was not the game I was expecting. If, like me, you have only glimpsed some early build trailers, then the design has clearly changed. Placed underwater, amongst the remains of humanity, you must come to grips with almost a century of change, and ultimately redefine the term human. Talking robots, mechanized humans and corrupted marine life all play their role in convincing you that something has gone horribly wrong.\n\nFrictional maintain a number of elements from their previous outings, including physics based puzzles. Almost any object can be grabbed, dropped and thrown; levers can be pulled; wheels can be twisted; doors pulled or pushed open. The concept lends a welcome tactile nature to the story which, sadly, falls back on a familiar trope: your all alone, EXCEPT for a voice to guide you. While you identify the owner of the voice, and ultimately take on their objective as your own, it still feels like a commitment to revealing the story through environment and atmosphere would have strengthened the isolation, making searching out information a puzzle in itself.\n\nThe look and setting of SOMA will bring obvious comparisons to Bioshock, but it's tenuous link at best. Skulking through the confined, industrialized corridors of Pathos II feels far removed from the Art Deco inspired, living spaces afforded to Rapture. No guns and plasmids, only exploring and hiding.\n\nWorth a special mention is the sound design, music and voice acting. Certain games lend themselves to headphones more than others, and you would be doing a disservice not to use them in this case. The effect is universally excellent in creating a sense of place, whether the groan of stressed metal or the muted, calm of the seafloor.\n\nPrevious Frictional releases have relied on enemies to provide constant tension and scares, leaving you cowering in darkened corners. SOMA's mechanized enemies don't appear as frequently, and tend to be solo when they do, but I personally found them to be frustrating. My main issue was their completely random nature. In one example I was left with the enemy blocking my only way forward, unresponsive to sound or light, and refusing to budge until I ran at it, died and restarted past that point. While they are fitting to the story and environment, I couldn't help but feel they may not have been necessary, and instead the developer felt pressured to include them.\n\nThere are some other issues, I experienced, that may or may not concern others. Loading times are looooong (up there with The Witcher 3), with intermittent loading occuring at strange intervals. Pacing is slower in the first half than the more compelling second. Objectives are not marked which leads to wandering and backtracking trying to find items and puzzles to solve.\n\nThe best test of the success of an idea is how it stays with you afterward. Like Life Is Strange, SOMA has remained with me since finishing, debating the choices I made and trying to reconcile the events into chronological order. It's Frictional's best story yet, offering a rich message that never takes away from the terror of playing. In fact, that message questioning what it means to be human, is SOMA's most terrifying element. The game isn't perfect, none are, but if an amazing story, wrapped in an absorbing atmosphere and sprinkled with puzzles is your thing, then it's an easy choice.","October 1, 2015","true","11.1"," 801 of 828 people (97%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","97","801","828","29","20"

Yesterday I launched the game and finished it in one session. It took me ___exactly 10___ hours to finish it. A night has passed and I think I can share my thoughts now:\n\nGOOD ASPECTS\nWhen you look back to Penumbra and Amnesia games, SOMA offers an enormous evolution visually speaking. The underwater world is very nicely done, whether it's in the ocean or in the facilities. A labyrinth area reminded me of a map near the end of Penumbra BP.\nThe story is all about sci-fi and psychological themes about life, death and continuity. It takes its importance within the game and I must say I enjoyed it more than I expected to.\nThe monsters you'll have the pleasure to meet have different behaviors and attacks, which is better than just the classic "I patrol, I see/hear you, I search you, I run at you". Nice designs.\nAmbiance in the levels is often close to some areas in Doom 3, Bioshock and even Dead Space, level design speaking. A nice thing.\nThe voices! Voiiiices!! Very nice addition!\nSound effects are well processed, you can feel the hard work here.\nChoices & actions can be hard to make at different times!\nIf you suffer from claustrophobia, the more you progress in the game, the deeper you'll get in the ocean and it's a great feeling! Is it?\nModding tools included!\nThe ending!!\nNOT-SO-GOOD ASPECTS\nTextures are sometimes very low: is it a bug or not? Will it be corrected? We'll see, after all, game just came out.\nOptimization problems: SOMA worked without ANY problem for me but I see that some people have poor FPS problems on decent configurations, so this will be improved and patched soon of course.\nPuzzles a bit simple.\nNo classic inventory. This will annoy some players for sure, personally it did not.\nMonsters are easy to avoid/escape if you're accustomed to Penumbra/Amnesia games.\nGame is too easy... well it's focused on story... so I guess it's ok?\nLess horror... but it has its stressful moments.\nThe ending!!\nTo conclude, you don't need to be a fan of previous Frictional Games works to play SOMA.\nThis game is an ambitious turn for its creators and I believe it is a successful one, good job!\nVisually, it's lovely. The SOMA universe & story are pretty fine.\n\nIf you are a fan of Bioshock and other games I named earlier here, you should give it a try, you'll like the ambience.\n\nMandatory recommendation to the lovers of the genre!","September 23, 2015","true","13.0"," 335 of 358 people (94%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","94","335","358","19","17"

From start to finish it kept my attention, and constantly made me think. Think about the story, about the characters, the situation, and most importantly, about what it means to be human. It’s a very appealing theme for a video game that I haven’t seen in games before (although I do realize there have been many films/books made about the topic).\n\nMade by Frictional games, the same developers of Amnesia the Dark Descent, I had high expectations for pretty much everything. They didn’t let me down. The new HPL 3 Engine looks amazing, and gave me some of the most atmospheric moments I’ve ever had in gaming. The sound design is top notch, and the voice actors are definitely worth commending. Although there aren’t many characters in the game, those that do feature, pull off incredible performances.\n\nAlthough the game had several scary moments, I personally found one part towards the end of the game absolutely terrifying. It’s safe to say that I really enjoyed the pacing of the game and how everything became particularly more intense as I progressed.\n\nProbably the only criticism I can make is the length of the game, which I felt was a bit short. A lot of reviewers criticized the puzzles, but I personally enjoyed them all for the most part.\n\nSoma is definitely worth playing if you enjoy survival horror. But even if you’re new to survival horror, I’m certain you’ll find this game worthwhile.","September 27, 2015","true","25.6"," 256 of 274 people (93%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","93","256","274","7","9"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BlackDragon17/recommended/282140/","BlackDragon17","BlackDragon17","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BlackDragon17/","87 products in account","Honestly, SOMA is one of the best games I've ever played.\n\nWhen playing non-multiplayer games I tend to completely immerse myself in the game world, forget my real surroundings. That's why I have never played a horror game and did not intend to ever touch one - I can't handle that stress. But then Frictional Games announced SOMA. Being a big enthusiast of the concept of Artificial Consciousness, the themes Frictional showed off two years ago got me very, very interested in the game to the point I kinda ignored it's a horror game the best I could.\n\nNow, that the game's finally released, I couldn't ignore it being a horror game anymore. What's worse: forcing myself to actually play a horror game for the first time in my life even though I don't like them; or not experiencing the game based on my favorite themes in person that I waited two years for.\n\nIt took a great bit of struggle, and it was by far the most terrifying experience I've ever had, but I played SOMA from start to finish the way it was meant to be played (alone at night etc), and god I'm glad I forced myself through it. Even though I developed unreasonable expectations over the time prior to launch, they were all met. I wasn't disappointed, in fact, I was surprised at how great the experience was (apart from the horror). I really enjoyed the atmosphere, I loved the world it's set in (there are so many awesome things about Pathos-II it's unbelievable), and, most importantly, I was amazed by the story.\n\nI still keep coming back to SOMA, keep thinking about it. I even decided to replay the first few parts recently because I love being in Pathos-II so much. In my opinion, the way SOMA ended does allow a further continuation of the story, and I really hope Frictional does something with it. I need more SOMA.\n\nTLDR: WAU that was good.","November 7, 2015","true","28.1"," 223 of 236 people (94%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","94","223","236","26","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IrishOcelot/recommended/282140/","IrishOcelot","Dusk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IrishOcelot/","292 products in account","From the makers of one of the most horrifying game series such as Penumbra and Amnesia, comes their new game SOMA.\nWhich for me..it was a great game no doubt but sadly it just didn't feel as scary or challenging as its previous contestants, which of course I will explain in detail.\n\nSOMA is the story of a simple man named Simon living in Ontario who gets called to do a special project, what he doesn't know is that he is about to embark on a brain scan train ride to hell as he wakes up under the sea in a base all deserted and alone...or is he? As he will now have one chance of saving humanity by going throughout the sea main bases and with the help of a friend, launch the ARK into space.\n\nGameplay wise it is what you will expect from Frictional Games as you go through the story solving puzzles and avoiding the creatures and experiments within. You are just a powerless bug as your only means of inventory is basically the Omnitool which helps you get around the base to areas that were previously locked or they serve as little hubs with your friend Catherine which you encounter a little later in the game as she will be your only means of contact throughout.\nYou will spend the time hiding and running from monsters as well as solving the puzzles to advance.\n\nNow let me get the problems out of the way, as I said, in the previous games the monsters were overall creative, smart, and scary. Sorry to say this but in SOMA, these are the most boring and uninterested monsters of all, I do not know if this was only in my game but half of these monsters act like they don't even want to hurt you or kill you at all, I was literally in the half way marker of the game trying to get a elevator chip upgrade while avoiding a "brown fungus gel" monster and when I made noise in the next room in a WELL LIT room and in a corner with OPEN SPACE, he literally pulled a derp move and acted like I wasn't there! I could tell he was probably like 3 feet away from me because your screen will start to glitch rapidly, then all of a sudden I could hear his footsteps move away, because in this game there is no means of hiding anywhere like in Amnesia, you just have to stay in the shadows and run like mad if they do manage to finally kill you.\n\nAnother thing that was kind of annoying was that also in previous games you could interact with your enviornment to solve the puzzles like hitting boxes to find extra stuff or moving this ladder to get up a level, well that is sorta taken out in this game as most of the interaction comes from picking up cortext chips and keeping them in a shallow inventory system which by the way, everything must be made of titanium because nothing will ever break, even the glasses. Minor thing to be picky about but yeah.\nAlso the puzzles in the game are half and half for me, some of them are creative and take a little to figure out while others are just basic kindergarten stuff like "Let's press 3 buttons to line up the monitor perfectly...ohhh!!!"\n\nNow as far as atmosphere goes, SOMA nails it perfectly, it does create such an intense atmosphere and it does make you feel so alone and weak, from the creepy lowly lit halls to the dead bottom of the dark ocean's abyss. Every moment in the atmosphere is very intense looking at what happened to the people of the base.\n\nAs for the rest, controls are smoothe and on point, even with running from the creatures and accurate depiction of undersea travels.\nMusic is once again great and eerie feeling to just dead silence putting you more on edge.\nNice little story that does throw some twists in there as well as an ending that will of course leave you asking, as I won't spoil it.\n\nSo overall it does have a couple of flaws but once again, don't get me wrong, it is a very great game that is also an easy win with capturing all of the achievements in one playthrough. Beautiful game with a nice story but sadly just falls flat with goofy monsters, and gameplay that can feel tedious in some parts, that you will probably clock in around 8-10 hours depending on how you play.\nSo I do recommend this game, if you are a survival horror fan I would give this game a shot.","October 8, 2015","true","14.7"," 212 of 247 people (86%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","86","212","247","11","12"

I was expecting great things from Frictional knowing that they had come from Amnesia the Dark Descent and I was not disappointed. They have made huge leaps in story depth, environment design and character development. Everything that I can think of that made Amnesia great is present as well as a new and original concept for a psychological horror game that gives it a completely new and chilling basis.\n\nIf you're a fan of horror in general, this game is a must have. I was engrossed from the very beginning up until the end and while there may not be as many scares as there were in Amnesia and Frictional's older Penumbra series, the game's pace, continuity and development is even more sinister and unsettling.\n\nI don't write reviews but for gems like this, it is a pleasure. I'd rate the game a solid 9/10 with no real let downs other than perhaps the lower frequency of those truly horrific chases and scares. In the end, the balance felt just right and you get plenty of opportunity to ponder over the game's questions and enjoy its beautiful environments before being thrown back into a spiral of terror.\n\nHighly recommended for those looking for a meaningful story, outstanding immersion and some good ol' andrenalin.","September 25, 2015","true","9.9"," 150 of 165 people (91%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","91","150","165","5","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/himmatsj/recommended/282140/","himmatsj","himmatsj","http://steamcommunity.com/id/himmatsj/","138 products in account","SOMA is a pretty good psychological survival-horror game. It's more like Alien: Isolation in that it builds the tension from the atmosphere of the game, rather than via cheap jump-scare tactics. There's a good story that talks about what it means to live, with talking robots that have the consciousness of their masters. Visuals are decent, while the sound design and voice acting are great.\n\nEven when there's no immediate danger, just listening to the sound gives you the chills. Can never be too sure what lurks around. The tension by way of the audio design is particularly brilliantly done in SOMA.\n\nYou can customize your controls fully, there are some graphics options to customize and you can save at any time and exit the game.\n\nAnyway, so far, I have two issues with the game. Both are worth mentioning but still overall my net outlook of the game is positive and that it is worth getting, especially if you like the premise of it.\n\nThe first is that the enemies can be frustrating. The first enemy I met was a "big daddy" kind of enemy. Easy to get around him, and I never saw it again so far. Then I think there's an enemy in the water but can't be too sure if that's considered an enemy or not. Anyway, the third one is kinda tricky and I had to brute force my way through. He can sense you electromagnetically, and I'm not sure how to get past. Trial and error took me past the first, and now there's another one of it that I can't seem to get past. So yeah, maybe I'm missing something, but this enemy is kinda frustrating making me try over and over again.\n\nThe second is that the graphics optimization is kinda underwhelming. Ok sure, I only have a GTX 750, but for this kind of a "corridor" based linear game, I expect 60fps on reduced settings. But often, being in a static room, my framerate would only be 45-50fps, and many times when moving around it may just be around 40fps. Can't really understand why. It doesn't look particularly amazing or demanding. I run Alien Isolation at 60fps no issues at High settings. The fact that the PS4 version only runs at 30fps (and even then not smoothly) where many other linear "corridor" games run at 60fps shows that the game could have been better optimized.\n\nSo yeah, overall it's still a very engrossing and immersive game, with an interesting theme and a good story. If you like narrative-driven games and don't mind some psychological horror elements, give this one a go!","September 22, 2015","true","14.1"," 313 of 384 people (82%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","82","313","384","10","21"

Frictional delivers yet another masterpiece. I even dare say they followed the saying: ''There's always room for more.'', after their fantastic Amnesia series.\nWhat we got from them here is one of those existential questioning games... combine that with horror, well-suited atmosphere, incredible sound effects and you get a memorable gem.\n\nSOMA has less enemy encounters than Amnesia, but I say it's for a good cause. What it lacks in terms of monsters, it completely delivers with the story. I'd say they got the perfect balance between hiding and actual advancing through the events. More encounters would have made me forget about the plot and it would have gotten unimmersive.\nBut when there is a monster showing around, expect it to be a challenging part. No more hiding in a corner and waiting for it to leave as in previous games, as SOMA's creatures are not just randomly going away after a while. They'll stay in your path and you have to carefully progress through the chambers and remember the map, in order to get away safe and sound.\n\nI did mention this is more of an existentional questioning game. I can't dig deeper into details on this one as it would all lead to story-breaking spoilers. Heck, even the premise of it is a spoiler. All I can say is that it successfully made me question what it is to be a human and what distinguishes us from artificial intelligences --robots-- .\n\nWhat I also loved about it was its length. 13 hours to finish an indie game is nothing short of amazing and I didn't even stay to read all notes and journals. I'll definitely give this game a second playthrough.\n\nThe inventory has been massively simplified since Amnesia and the sanity/health system is also changed. Looking at some monsters for too long will give away your position and health can be restored at healing places throughout the journey.\n\nTechnically speaking, the game suffers from a poor optimization. I was getting massive frame drops in some places. Visually it does not excel either. But I can get past these issues coming from a small company. On the other side, I haven't encountered many bugs nor grammatical errors and kudos to the developers for taking their time and patching up their game!\n\n*End-game debate incoming (definitely spoilers ahead); please skip to next paragraph for general personal rating if you haven't completed the game yet.*\nThe feeling that was following me up to the very end was one of déjà vu. There is another game out there that raised the exact same questioning: The Talos Principle. Apocalypse, AI that would replace the mankind and would live through a new aeon? These two games are as if set in the same universe. If you put away the gameplay of them, you will notice that they both follow the same plot.\nIs artificial intelligence capable of replacing the human brain? In SOMA, a group of scientists work in projecting it on digital chips. The Talos Principle follows a similar path, with one AI already constructed and left in sleep mode until it proves that it acts and thinks humanlike.\nIn both games you are playing as a virtual mind placed into a carcass, in order to continue human legacy. Could these two games be set in the same world? The similarities between them are astonishing.\nAlso, SOMA's concept of replicating someone's mind is extremely intriguing. Are you the first AI copy of Simon after his death? Like in the end of the game, where he is duplicated and a part of him remains alone for an eternity on a wasted planet, while the other rests forever in the ARK, on a digital island.. The main character could very well not be the first copy of his brain awoken.\n\nPros: + Excellent plot and an overall amazing storyline. The journey that the player takes from the beginning to the end never ceased to amaze me.\n+ Incredible sound effects. Not just one time have I thought some environment sounds are actually coming from my room.\n+ Perfect mix of horror and story telling.\n+ Impressively long while still maintaining to not get boring.\n+ Great puzzles that add to the core, just like in the Amnesia series.\n+ The atmosphere perfectly blends in.\n+ The voice acting is also well-crafted.\n+ More types of monsters with different behaviors. They also have some great sound effects implemented, you will hear them if they're wandering on a nearby corridor or if they have detected you.\n+ Overall balanced difficulty. Does not make the player replay the same area countless of times due to dying, but is also thought as to not be rushed through with ease.\n+ Does continue Frictional's unique horror style.\n\nNeutral: +/- Different system of health and sanity, like shortly described above. Some players may welcome the changes with open arms, while others may dislike it compared to the old one from Amnesia: The Dark Descent.\n+/- Depending on everyone's tastes, I suppose the game suffers from a lack of replayability.\n+/- Enemy AI. They're not brainless, but nothing amazing about their thinking either.\n\nCons: - Poor optimization... may encounter frame drops, stutter and even freezes in some areas, even while lowering the settings.\n- Infinite battery flashlight. A similar system to the one from older Frictional titles would also suit SOMA better in my opinion and would add to the difficulty.\n- Uhm... where's the enemy robots? I was disappointed to only encounter the big machines with flashlights 2 or 3 times and only in the first quarter of the game... They were some great enemies in my opinion and would have surely also suited some other areas.\n- Can get extremely frustrating to cope with the visual screen tearing while the monster is chasing you. Later on in the game, you're almost always getting caught by it if he sees you, anyway.\n\nSOMA is a must for anyone that loved Frictional's other games. For the others, this is a great decision if you're looking for a thrilling story with scary elements and atmosphere. I definitely not regret pre-ordering this one and I want to thank the developers for bringing in another masterpiece to Steam.\n\nPersonal rating: 91/100 - Amazing","October 9, 2015","true","29.2"," 148 of 164 people (90%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","90","148","164","11","20"

It truly is an experience and tells a really good story. The characters compliment the story well and really add to the overall plot and narrative. I grew to really like both Simon and Catherine which is something I can't say for a lot of games in the genre. The game oozes atmosphere and really draws you in but the enemies are just poorly done and there are a few issues dealing with the plot that I personally didn't like.\n\nThe main issue with SOMA is the AI. Some people say the game would be better off without having any enemies in it but I genuinely think the real issue is in it's AI and the fact that it really needed to be a lot better than what we were left with. It's strictly scripted and incredibly predictable save for scripted events. The AI isn't really much of an AI. It simply obides by three rules:\n1. Teleports to player if it's not close enough.\n2. If there's a noise made by the player it runs after the player.\n3. Patrols the proximity of where the player is.\n\nThis just leads to what can only be described as blatant cheating. The game knows where you are and it makes no attempt at hiding that fact which is incredibly frustrating. There may only be one enemy in an entire complex but because of the three rules the AI is tied to it will always be stuck to you no matter how quiet, how slow or how fast you are. It's especially because of the third rule which leads to the most frustration in the game. You're quiet, you haven't made a noise but the enemy, even though you were last seen on the other side of the map and so was the monster/enemy only moments ago, randomly spawns behind you and makes the same patrol route over and over and over. If you stay in a room be prepared to see the enemy pace back and forth every 30 seconds on the dot and then do the exact same thing when you move to the next room and the next and the next...\n\nTo put it lightly, the AI is nonexistent. There are five enemy types and they all repeat the same looped patrol pattern over and over. It's a shame because each enemy type is supposed to be unique but they end up being bland and the exact same as the previous monster. One is blind, one you can't look at and one only responds to noise but it just doesn't matter when they all follow the same three rules. It will only take you up to the second enemy to realise this unfortunately. It also takes away any challenge in playing the game to remove any real threat to the player in having something so limited and held back with zero freedom and very little attention given to it. This game really would have delivered in the horror department if the enemies were given a bit more life and not held on such a tight leash so to speak. The AI really needed to be stupid in a practical sense to be enjoyable; as in if a noise was made the enemy would rush to where the noise was and stay there to investigate even if the player wasn't anywhere near, perhaps add a few curve balls in that the enemy would grow frustrated in being mislead one too many times and literally go beserk running around the level tearing up the place trying to find the player. Unfortunately nothing like this happens and it has lead to a lot of people surmising the game probably would have been better off without having any enemies in the it at all. It is an absolute shame too because the amount of times I stood on a glass vase or moved something by accident and made noise would have proven to be some of the most terrifying experiences if only the AI was actually good but because of how bad it is nothing ever came of it. Even enemies that were supposed to react to noise only reacted when you threw items right beside them. It was just so bad and a real sin against an otherwise amazing game.\n\nThe other issue deals with the plot. Some parts of it are introduced but immediately forgotten. For instance, and minor spoiler, when you meet Amy and if you choose to save her you never mention her again. Even when you come across someone who could possibly provide help you never mention her. You don't even refer to the machines that think they're human specifically. What really bothered me was actually what we were presented with in the beginning of the game: Simon and his girlfriend/love interest, Ashley. It's thirty seconds long and you never read or hear about it beyond that save for reading a newspaper clipping in the first bit of gameplay. What's more is all decisions you make in the game have no real effect on the story. You're lead to believe early on that healing and taking energy from other robots detracts from the game and it's story, as in it takes systems offline and makes it harder, effecting the game as you play through but the reality is after the first hour or two the most that will happen is the energy will be sucked out of lights, making it a bit dimmer. It's really sad to think what could have been although it's most likely something that was started but later deemed too ambitious for the size of the developer and thus abandoned.\n\nOverall, the game is still really good. It's an 8 out of 10 being docked marks due to the lack of AI and the fact that game wasn't really scary at all(Which I attribute to the AI) when it was billed as being a horror game. Some scary elements but they really failed to deliver in most parts even though they did go out of their way to do some rather freaky and suggestive things only to have nothing come from them(Such as doors being opened a-jar when you return to them minutes later).\n\nWould I recommend it? Absolutely. Full price? Yeah, definitely. You'll get on average 10-12 hours if you don't rush the game and if you look around and take the time to read all or most bits of information available you'll spend about 15 or so hours. There's no real replay value but I can see it being fun to rush through the game on a second run. The one thing I will add is that those hours spent playing the game will mostly be entertaining and very enjoyable. There are frustrations with the enemy AI but overall, 90% of the time, it's a real treat to play.","September 27, 2015","true","16.5"," 150 of 169 people (89%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","89","150","169","5","4"

Continuing their tradition of innovating the horror genre that began with the seminal Penumbra and Amnesia titles, games that have inspired so many since, with Soma they have achieved nothing less than inventing a new genre for gaming: Existential Horror.\n\nSoma has all the hallmarks of great horror; atmosphere aplenty, immersive sound, suspense and tension, shocks and scares. They had already achieved mastery over these elements in games that so many have borrowed from. But Soma introduces another element, something deeper and more truly horrifying than almost anything imaginable. It delves into the human psyche and threatens it's very core needs. It identifies the fundaments of who and what we are, then takes them away. This can potentially cause an existential crisis in the contemplative mind. What other vehicle of media can claim that? Perhaps some movies and great works of fiction touch upon it, but the closest I've ever been to such a feeling is upon waking from a nightmare.\n\nGet it. Play it. Feel it.

My take on SOMA is a bit on the long-ish side :D)\n\n\nThe Gist of the Story\nSoma is an intriguing game about Simon Jarrett. Due to a grave injury, Simon’s young life is cut short. With his impending death on the horizon, Simon turns to a David Munshi for Simon’s last resort since Munshi is working on technology that could save Simon’s life. Later on, after the initial tryout of Munshi’s machine, Simon wakes up to an unfamiliar place filled with robots, friendly or not, and some kind of cancerous growth (that’s actually an AI system that has gone rogue), called the Wau, slithering anywhere it can go to.\n\nConfused, Simon begins seeking for answers and soon meets with Catherine Chun, a researcher in charge of the Ark project, an invention that holds the key to humanity’s survival. Catherine explains that most of civilization was wiped out by a comet and the remainder of human kind lives here in Pathos-II, a futuristic facility that hosts both humans and machines. She adds that if Simon helps her transport the Ark, there will be a spot for him in the Ark. Of course he agrees and with a goal at hand, Simon learns, throughout his expedition to the ends of the world, the ultimate fate of the residents of Pathos-II and the meaning of being human.\n\n-- --\n\nDid ya scare me?\nThe scare factor of the game, on the scale of 1-10 (1 being, “me looking for something to scare me but couldn’t find it, no matter how hard I tried” and 10 being, “I ♥♥♥♥ my pants, I should’ve worn a diaper”), I rate Soma an 8 out of 10 (8 being, “Let’s NOPE out of here, please.”)\n\nSoma keeps things fresh by introducing a new enemy almost every area transition. These enemies are a slight variation of each other, with the exception of the patrolling robot at the beginning of the game. I am very glad there are multiple enemies because sometimes in horror games, there will only be one single enemy stalking you throughout the game and over time, the game’s scariness dulls downs if it doesn’t change its tactics.\n\nI won’t describe all the hostiles but there are 6 enemies in total. You can skip this part if you’re not interested in reading my observations about two of the monsters I liked.\n\nAs mentioned before, I have two favorites and the first one is a monster that’s described as a person that was raised from the dead (because of the Wau). Its head comprise of bright, glowing, blue eyes (I’ll call him Many Eyes.) The enemy isn’t dangerous as long as Simon doesn’t approach or/and look at it. It’s slow and will observe you but in my experience it will never out rightly harmed you unless you do something stupid.  However, the scare factor lies in how Simon’s vision will shake and distort upon gazing at this creature. It scared the hell out of me the first time.\n\nMy second favorite is this crying woman. She’s similar to Many Eyes but she becomes more frantic if you walk towards her. You can stare at her for a period of time, as long as you maintain your distance. The scare factor with her is when you cross the line of her personal space. She screams and bolts towards you erratically and unexpectedly. You cannot image how fast I ran out of the room (in-game).\n\nThe game doesn’t only rely on its monsters to scare its player. In conjunction with the ambient sounds in the environment, the eerie feeling that you’re not alone will manifest itself as you progress through the dark corridors of Pathos-II. Every clank, every murmur, every patter of distant footsteps will set up a creepy vibe that I enjoyed very much. If you plan on playing this game, please, I implore you to wear headphones!\n\n-- --\n\nGameplay\nSimon can only run and hide. He cannot use any weapons and you as the player must rely on your wits to avoid danger. There are puzzles that needs to be solved to continue the storyline and I thought some of them were somewhat challenging. I found searching for things kind of annoying since the key items do not glint but I blame that part for my not so perceptive nature. There is no journal entries that updates so you can’t look back at your current objectives but you can always talk to Catherine for a reminder. There's no inventory as well.\n\nDuring my time in Soma, most of the hostiles are easy to outrun and in fact, there’s a visual cue when something threatening is nearby. The screen will start to distort until the monster is nowhere in the vicinity. Most of the time, they lose interest in Simon very quickly. At first, this bothered me but I realized this is a good thing. I don’t want to spend most of my time hiding and running away from the monsters. This way, it doesn’t ruin the pacing of the game and gives you enough time to absorb the atmosphere.\n-- --\n\nGraphics and Technical Issues\nEach level are beautifully designed with small details that shows that there were people living in Pathos-II before the tragedy struck. There are many graphical options to choose from to suit your needs and for the most part, I didn’t experience any hiccups, crashes, frame drops and bugs (Specs: GTX 970, i7-4790S, 12 GB of ram…so on and so forth). However, I have a friend who had a few crashes and some people are having problems launching the game. Visit the game’s Community Hub to learn more about these issues.\n\n-- --\n\nMy Observations (minor spoilers)\nThe story, in my honest opinion, is a tear jerker. The game doesn’t have a morality system (at least not to my knowledge) but at certain times, you are given a choice whether or not to end a life or let them continue on. It doesn’t seem to affect the story but it does make you think, “Is he/she better off dead or alive?” I struggled with this one but I always chose to end them because in most cases, these “people” are hooked up to this cancerous growth, called the Wau. What the Wau basically does is it tries to correct and fill in for whatever was destroyed within the body. In robots, it can heal minor malfunctions and at worst case, they need to be hooked up to it permanently until manual repair is done. In humans, the Wau wants to prevent the death of the human and as a result, the Wau restores the life of the dead, at the cost of the person’s individuality. Would someone really want to live this way?\n\nThe ending is also  bittersweet . It was well done, in my opinion.\n\n-- --\n\nWrap Up\nOverall, from start to finish, Soma kept me on my toes. It took me 11 hours to beat the game and it’s a decent amount of gameplay for a $29.99 title. I highly recommend Soma to fans of horror games. You won’t regret it!\n\nThanks for reading!!\n\n-- --\n\nTL;DR\nPros:\n- Thought provoking story and interesting characters.\n- Multiple enemies keep the player on their toes.\n- Kept me on edge throughout the game\n- Beautiful graphics\n- Great ambient sounds and atmosphere\n\nCons:\n- Reports of crashing and problems with launching the game\n\n-- --\n\nIf you have the time, watch me fool around in Soma :D\n\nSOMA Video","October 1, 2015","true","11.3"," 93 of 103 people (90%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","90","93","103","7","1"

Despite a slightly older engine and lower resolution textures than I would like, the game does manage to pull off some impressive underwater scenes. The audio design is superb. I only noticed one serious bug towards the end which a reload of a save fixed.

The setting, the atmosphere, the sound design, the story and the gameplay, all came together perfectly to form an amazing experience. Right after i beat it, i dove right back in for another playthrough to pick up any details i might have missed the first time around. So far ive put in over 100 hours to a 8-11 hour game (it took me 16 to complete the first time). About half of that 100 was for taking screenshots, but that’s just a testament to how compelling the world of SOMA really is.\n\nTake the underwater setting of Rapture from Bioshock, throw in a bit of the industrial architecture of the Ishimura from Dead Space, add the sci-fi station aesthetic of Sevastopol from Alien Isolation and the Von Braun from System Shock 2 and finally, mix the creepy, disturbing atmosphere of all 4 of those games together and you have PATHOS-II, the sprawling underwater research facility, set deep beneath the Atlantic ocean. With gameplay taking place about 50% inside of the different areas and 50% outside, no matter where you are, you really feel the desolation and crushing weight of the world you’re exploring. As the game progresses you head deeper and deeper into the ocean, which only adds to the already harsh and unnerving experience. The later areas were some of the most intense things ive played in a while. Frictional Games really nailed the underwater look and feel in SOMA.\n\nGraphically the game has all kinds of fitting things going for it that help draw you into its world. The inky black shadows broken up by the flickering lights give off the necessary horror vibes and the glitchy computer screens that look like they’re crying out for help make you anxious about even touching them. The textures, while not super high res, are right on target to show the broken down state of the facility and the hazy depth of field during the outside segments perfectly suits the blurred vision you get from being underwater. Dirt particles swirl around you every step of the way while you’re in the water, enhancing the murkiness, which makes you feel almost lost and hopeless at times. Inside the facility you’ll find broken pipes, dangling wires and foggy rooms, while out in the ocean you’ll come across all kinds fish, crabs, turtles and even shrimp. Another great addition to the game is its sound design. The somber music blends in amazingly to the game as a whole, never taking you out of the moment, only adding to it. And then there are the sound effects, which are imperative to the experience. They added so much tension and believability to PATHOS-II. This is definitely one of those games where you want the headphones on with the volume turned up and the lights all the way off.\n\nI felt the gameplay was well balanced too, with large areas to explore at your own pace broken up by some fun and challenging puzzles, as well as a few run and hide sections. The monsters were quite ghoulish and scary and it was thrilling being chased and hiding from them. During the slower parts, you’ll find yourself looking into every room, desk drawer and computer, searching for details about this grim story you’re a part of. And what an interesting story it is. While the game starts slow, the narrative keeps building until you’re completely submerged mentally in the world and characters around you. Even after the game was through, i couldn’t help but continue to think about what i had just played and the choices i had made during my journey.\n\nSOMA is a fantastic, well put together game and I can’t recommend it enough. If you’re looking for a dark, moody, story driven game that has a Bio/System Shock mixed with Alien Isolation feel, i think you’ll really enjoy this as well!\n\nThanks to Frictional Games and Brian at Evolve Pr for the review copy.","October 17, 2015","true","102.6"," 66 of 74 people (89%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","89","66","74","8","3"

In the best possible sense, I might add, which is to say:  Not TOOOOOO long a way!  If the Penumbra and Amnesia games could arguably be considered logical extensions of one another, and the first two "franchises" in an exemplary and more-or-less pioneering trilogy of "first-person stealth-horror" games, then SOMA (and any sequels it might spawn) is not only the third part of that trilogy of franchises, but the logical extension of those earlier games in pretty much every way, shape and form.\n\nSimply put, many of the hallmarks we've come to know and love are present:  Excellent storytelling, highly interactive (and thereby ludicrously immersive) first-person environments, horror themes, a protagonist with some form of brain/mental problems, an often hallucinatory breakdown between fantasy and reality, and last but certainly not least, some SCARY ♥♥♥♥IN' ♥♥♥♥ goin' on.  Oh, and did I mention a complete and utter defencelessness against any and all nasties which come your way?  Yup, it's all here.\n\nThe setting, of course, has changed...and it's as radical and engrossing a departure as the Penumbra series shifting all the way from its oppressive arctic base-land to Amnesia: The Dark Descent's spooky medieval castle.  This time around, in SOMA, we have a hi-tech underwater facility (and its surrounding seas), which we are ushered into after a brief intro which strongly recalls Philip K. ♥♥♥♥ and Total Recall (influences which they're hardly trying to deny, considering they QUOTE the guy before the gameplay proper even begins)!  And suffice it to say, it all gets substantially more ♥♥♥♥ed-up from there.\n\nIn many ways, this is also arguably Frictional's most, erm, "accomplished" game, given that they've split the difference between their own past games and The Chinese Room's somewhat infamous Amnesia sequel.  That is to say, by removing borderline-inconsequential nonsense like The Dark Descent's healing items and sanity systems, but at the same time not taking things to quite the extreme that Machine For Pigs did in terms of favouring "storytelling" so massively over "gameplay".  So for all you nay-sayers of The Chinese Room's contribution to the Frictional legacy...rest assured, the "gameplay" elements have well and truly returned (though minus the really, really freaking difficult puzzles of the Penumbra games, which is a blessing at least as far as this particular dunce is concerned).  Now, whether or not any of this makes SOMA a "better" product than any previous game to bear the Frictional name is of course a tad subjective, and probably depends to some degree on whether you greatly favour more antiquated settings over sci-fi settings, or vice-versa; in that regard, actually, SOMA perhaps more closely resembles the Penumbra series than the Amnesias, while also bringing to mind obvious comparisons with the Bioshock games, System Shock games, Half-Life games, Dead Space games, Alien: Isolation, etc etc.  It also reminds me quite a bit of a certain late 90s sci-fi horror film called Virus, though I'm relieved to report that it's much, much better than that very flawed and highly disappointing Hollywood effort of yesteryear.\n\nLook, it's all a bit of a no-brainer, really:  If you enjoyed ANY of Frictional's previous products, you're probably gonna like this one.  If you enjoyed ALL of Frictional's previous efforts - like my dear self - then you are probably gonna LOVE this one, and should probably just buy it and stop reading reviews by smarmy dickwads like myself, 'cause you know it's gonna be good anyway, right?  But what if you've NEVER played a Frictional game?  Well, then I'm assuming you're not much of a connoisseur of horror video games, and it's ABOUT BLOODY TIME you gave a Frictional game a go, alright?!  I can't promise that you won't be disappointed - NONE of us can promise such ridiculous things - but who knows, you may just see what all the fuss has been about for all these years.  Hell, even if you're not that keen on "scary" games, chances are you may still find the sci-fi/fantasy elements compelling enough to have a mind-shatteringly good time (the outdoors-in-the-ocean stuff is especially epic, and needs to be experienced to be believed)!\n\nThere's one thing you can be certain about getting with this game:  Quality.  With a capital frickin' Q.  Oh, and absolutely, positively, hands-down one of the most utterly brilliant endings to a video game which you WILL EVER EXPERIENCE.

(My opinion, seems to vary a lot between different people though)\n+No loading screens that break immersion.\n+Amazing sound design; you can't differenciate ambient or physics sounds from actual sound triggers. Every object has a unique sound to it as well.\n+It's not really possible to "outsmart" the AI, and it got a whole lot better at hearing you as well.\n+Really enjoyable story to it. You never knew what'd happen next!\n+Visually incredibly gorgeous, especially for an indie game! Huge environments and pleasing to look at.\n+No inventory system where you have to manage resources, everything is inside of the game world, which also keeps up immersion.\n+There's many many monsters and they all work completely different.\n+When loading a saved file, you get reminded where you left off and what you had to do. Helps a lot if you take longer breaks from the game.\n\nThere's a few things I noticed, and while they weren't really too annoying while I played, I do want to mention them:\n\n-Still has a few bugs and crashes in it, which can actually make you permanently stuck at times (unless you reload an earlier save).\n-Some monster parts really stretch out and get tiring over time, especially if you have no physics objects nearby to lure the monster away with sound.\n-Not sure if this is only the case for me, but I've had incredibly long initial loading times. Around 2 minutes if I just launched the game and hit "Continue".\n-A few times, it was hard to see what you had to do in a puzzle, if there's something hidden behind a panel for example, it can be hard to find without looking it up online.\n-With the amount of names you get in the story, it's hard to keep track of who's who. Sometimes you hear a name but are unsure if it is relevant, if you forget who it is and what not.\n-The game has jumpscares. May add to the atmosphere/story, but mostly are just forcing you to be scared (especially the one inside of Omicron is just redundant and doesn't add much at all)\n\nIf you are a fan of good horror games and liked Amnesia: TDD, this definitely will be for you!","September 24, 2015","true","28.8"," 62 of 76 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","62","76","0","10"

This game was a mere 30 dollars and I got hours of gameplay, all of which were fantastic. The game, unlike most, is story driven, not based upon action or, much unlike even Amnesia, running and hiding. Although yes, in this game you DO have to hide from time to time, it's not nearly as excessive as in Amnesia.\nThis game is focused more on story, environment, and atmosphere than anything elsee. Without spoiling anything, I can say that this game is breathtakingly beautiful at times, as well as beautifully ambigious.\n\nPROS:\n-Long Game; hours of enjoyable gamplay\n-No Repeated environments [No copy-pasted areas]\n-Splendid atmosphere setup\n-Minimal Jumpscares, horror comes from atmosphere and situational threats\n-Clear and easy to follow storyline (Very Ambiguous, however the story is revealed as you play)\n-Rewards exploration with extra plot information\n-VERY HIGH attention to detail within the environment, lots of small features that aren't needed, but add to immersion\n-Fantastic Graphics\n-Great voice acting\n-Smooth, clean animations\n-Occasional easy puzzles\n-Exploration IS optional [Although I do recommend it]\n-Relatable Characters\n-Interesting Character Design\n\nCONS:\n-Streamlined, but still Linear plot\n-Choices are offered, however they don't affect the story [Some affected gameplay briefly]\n-Max Settings Are Somewhat strenuous for a PC\n-VERY Ambiguous\n-Hiding From Enemies Slows Down Gameplay\n-Checkpoints are sometimes too far apart\n-Objective not always crystal clear [Mostly is, however]\n-THAT'S ALL I CAN THINK OF\n\n\nPersonal Thoughts [NO SPOILERS]\n\nI didn't rush through this game, I explored every area except one, and you can see how long I played this game. For only 30 dollars, I got hours of gameplay, and I enjoyed every single bit of it. Not once did I think "Ugh...can I just get past this already?" All areas were both vivid and diverse, which honestly stuns me. The devs could have gotten away with copy-pasting a lot of this game's environments, however they are constantly different. EXAMPLE: I specifically remember 7 kitchens. Not a single kitchen was the same...and it's a kitchen, that's not even important to the game. But they always differed in design and layout. The game has so much painstaking detail that I just stopped from time to time and had to remind myself..."People made this..."\n\nI've played, and do play a lot of games, and I've not enjoyed a game like this in ages. I was invested in the story, and best of all, as someone who isn't scared by movies or games, I was able to feel chills in this game. Not from the presence of enemies, but from the ambiguity of the story, the atmosphere, and the potential threat of enemies. This game's sense of atmosphere was like nothing else I've seen in a large number of games I've played, and the world, not just the level design, but the world it sets up is just...awe inspiring. I was taken aback with each sight I saw, and all the ways they kept the plot flowing. No part was too slow, none too fast, and the enemy sequences were ever over done, at least not to my taste.\n\nThis game had me do a lot more than just play, it had me think as well. Not because of puzzles, but because of the story. It constantly had me putting more thought into what is happening than most books even can make me do. The way these developers tell a story is just unparalleled, and I am still in awe over how stunningly fun and enthralling this game was.\n\nThis is the kind of game where, if I had friends, they would hate me because I wouldn't be able to shut my mouth about just how much I loved it, and just how strongly I recommend it. This game is like none other, and honestly, I WILL be replaying it at some point. Not because the game will have more to offer, but because it was just...that...fun. It was beautiful. It was vivid. It was new. And without a doubt, I would recommend this to anyone who ever asked for a good game, a great game, or hell...maybe even a perfect game. You don't get much closer than this.\n","September 27, 2015","true","10.8"," 45 of 50 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","45","50","2","0"

The less you know about it going in the better, but it's got one of the most compelling and thought provoking stories of any game I've ever played. A lot of people may overlook this game because it has kind of been lumped into the "survival horror" category since that's kind of Frictional Games' niche since they did the Amnesia games. But there's so much more to it than that.\n\nI'm really not big on horror games. But I wouldn't really call this a horror game. It's a sci-fi adventure game with horror elements. There's definitely a lot of nail biting moments and there are scary parts too. It's horror in the same way that James Cameron's "Aliens" was horror. It was more thrill than frightening, but it had its fair share of frightening moments. While in previous games made by Frictional, the story kind of revolved around the horror and the scares, in SOMA, the story is 100% the focus of the game. The scarier aspects of the game come about from the story itself, as a biproduct for everything that's happening. There were only a few portions of the game where I felt deeply uneasy and uncomfortable since the games puts you in situations where something may be...hunting you and you have no means to defend yourself. That element does play a role in the game, but the horror element pretty much stops there.\n\nThis game is like reading an incredibly riveting science fiction novel. Like one of the classics. It's so full of philosophical and existential dilemmas that revolve around things as grand as the meaning and definition of life, like what is life? Is our scientific definition for life enough? This game is incredibly creative with how it poses these questions, and it does so in a way that doesn't feel like you are being lectured to. While you are fairly isolated for most of the game, the characters that are there are complex and interesting and relatable, and realistically portrayed in terms of their personalities and interactions with each other. The world of the game itself is so well constructed that it gives itself a sense of space and scale, that it feels like a real place, not a "video game" type world where everything is sort of compacted together to fit into world of the game (kind of like the grand theft auto games which feature miniature versions of real cities). The world of SOMA feels real, immersive, and detailed (so much so that I at one point actually pulled out a map online of the fictional underwater facility that this takes place in to figure out where I was and where I was going). It's linear but with plenty of exploration and occasionally non-linear objectives, similar to games like Bioshock & Half-Life.\n\nIt's not that long of a game (9-12 hours cumulatively depending on how much time you explore/get lost). I know a lot of people probably will overlook this because they don't really do horror games, but like I said, I'm not a fan of horror games either, but I really loved this game. It's scary at times but it wasn't nightmare inducing, at least for me. Overall I really enjoyed it and would highly recommend it to any fans of sci-fi games.","November 8, 2015","true","11.4"," 41 of 44 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","41","44","2","1"

What makes this game so impressive is the incredibly natural pacing, storytelling and puzzles where it is pretty much always clear what you need to do/where you need to go despite a complete lack of any sort of UI or objectives screen. Even during the relatively open ocean-walking sequences I never became lost, almost as if the devs intuatively knew which way players would go. Puzzles are of similar quality; generally you aren't really told what needs to be done, but it can be quite easily figure it out based on the context.\n\nThe story is also a highlight, diving into some similar themes as last year's The Talos Principle. While I didn't find the narrative quite as thought provoking as that game, the way the story is told is masterful. Conversations with another character move the central plot forward, but there is a incredible amount of often very important detail to be found in exploring the environment and interacting with various computers/documents that are lying around. It is all done in such a non-gamey way that this science fiction game manages to feel more grounded in reality than many games based in todays real world.\n\nAll of this adds up to make the game incredibly immersive. This is aided by stellar sound design that is responsible for much of the tension throughout the relatively lengthy game (for this genre). There are still some terrifying sequences, with a couple of memorable ones later in the game I will likely not forget any time soon. I would say that SOMA is the pinnacle of immersive story-driven gaming, with near-AAA production values (they just need to work on character models) making it easy to forget this is coming from a small indie developer.\n\nFrictional have once again proven themselves to be masters of their genre, and waiting to see what they do next will be a painful process.","September 30, 2015","true","9.2"," 40 of 43 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","40","43","2","3"

I've always respected sea as the strongest of all the forces of nature and trembled under the attacks of my imagination. What kind of horrors these dark depths hide from puny humans? Years later, Frictional Games delivers the answer - unimaginable horrors and philosophical questions about humanity's own existence.\n\nYou're playing the role of Simon, your average, twenty something guy that goes for a brain scan and wakes up... somewhere? That somewhere is PATHOS 2, science station hidden in the vast universe on our planet - below the waves of Atlantic Ocean. You'll take Simon on 8-12 hours journey to depths of watery hell, in an epic struggle to survive and find answers to loads of questions.\n\nIf you've played Frictional Games titles before, you know very well what to expect. First person movement, no HUD and you use mouse to interact with objects. It can get clunky from time to time, but it's never dull. Your enemies are strong and there's no way to fight them, so you'll need to crouch and get past them - if you don't like stealth, this game is not for you. The nicest thing about enemies in SOMA is that they are difficult, yet not frustrating and even if you die, you will gladly reload and get back on track.\n\nIn my not so humble opinion, SOMA reigns over other FG titles because a) story; b) design and atmosphere; c) sound.\n\nStory may appear to be well known (at least some of its elements) to sci-fi enthusiasts, but it still manages to create a perfect combo with design and atmosphere. I don't want to spoil anything for anyone, therefore, I'll just say SOMA is story-driven experience and it progresses as a fine piece of art, an interactive movie that makes you come back for more once your gaming session is over. The end of the game is emotional and well directed and the emotions you will experience from witnessing the end game are directly influenced by your own opinions about life, achievements and goals.\n\nDesign and atmosphere, hands down, game of the year. I'm not sure what kind of games will be launched until the end of 2015 to beat SOMA in this fight. Everything about this game is terrific - sense of loneliness, desperation, isolation. When you first exit dry and enter wet and start walking the ocean floor, you'll experience such a tremendous impact, a fusion of beauty and horror not seen so often in the games like this. When you go even deeper and end up in a violent ocean current, you'll feel nauseated, lost and alone.\n\nSound. Man, oh man... SOUND. Samuel Justice and his team. I had to google the name of the guy who was in charge of SOMA's sound. Horror games usually let sound engineers play with sounds. Justice and his team did not do that - they've literally ruled the sounds and used them to terify the players. Dry sounds, underwater sounds, mechanical sounds, enemy sounds, voices. Everything is so perfect and binaural, YOU NEED TO PLAY THIS ONE WITH GOOD HEADPHONES. Fantastic sound design, a lot to be learned from these guys. SOMA could prove to be revolutionary in the field of horror games audio design.\n\nPersonally, I feel SOMA's the pinnacle of Frictional Games work and they've set up the new standards with this one. The next thing they deliver will be judged heavily by standard known as SOMA.\n\nBuy. Play. Get Scared.\n\n***\nIf you like this review, feel free to join me for some more recommendations at http://steamcommunity.com/groups/libereviews","October 10, 2015","true","11.6"," 45 of 51 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","45","51","2","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/poopybutts/recommended/282140/","poopybutts","Andem","http://steamcommunity.com/id/poopybutts/","618 products in account","to start off, there's not gonna be any story spoilers here because I think the story is one of the bigger strong points of the game. Hopefully this review isn't too rambly and chaotic, sorry if it is.\n\nI have some mixed feelings about this game as a long time fan of Penumbra and Amnesia: Dark Decent. (not Machine for Pigs.) I think this game is pretty great, but it is not without its flaws.\n\nFirst of all, I know no one is going to like hearing this if you're a fan of the series, but this is more of a sequel to Machine for Pigs than it is Dark Decent of Penumbra. Gameplay wise that is. There's no inventory screen again in this, there's no insanity, there's no health items. There is some form of health, and you can actually die, but it's a little weird and a bit too shallow for my taste.\n\nThat being said, though, if I am going to call it more of a gameplay sequel to Machine for Pigs, it is a great sequel. It improved upon that game in almost every single way.\n\nMost importantly, you can throw EVERYTHING around again. Like in Dark Decent. It's just fun to do that. In a spooky game like this, it's great to sometimes just have fun with the physics and throw stuff around. To me, it tells me that the devs say "hey, if you want to mess around go ahead, that's cool." In machine for pigs they essentially say "No fun allowed, this is a serious story, screw you, play it how we intended or get out."\n\nThe gameplay is pretty shallow, but as you progress you do actually get much more involved which is why I recommend this game in the first place. At first, I really thought this would be another walking simulator since nothing seemed to happen. But as you go on, the monsters and even the areas expand a bit and you find yourself not just walking forward. There ends up being more puzzles as well and it does keep you playing. I don't think it's as much gameplay as Amnesia or maybe even Penumbra, but I don't totally mind because this game does some things extremely well.\n\nFirst and most importantly of all, the game's sound design is amazing. Amnesia had great spooky sounds, ambience, and music, and Soma just blows it out of the park. Many people praise this game for being atmospheric and that's because the sounds in this game are just great. There's so many of them. When you're messing around with physics, you can see how almost every object makes different noises against different surfaces or other objects. There's always thumping and ocean noises or other strange noises going on that keeps you on edge, thinking maybe a monster is around. I might be jumping to conclusions, but I was reminded of Myst in a way.\n\nSecond, the lighting, I feel is really good in this game as well and also really adds to the atmosphere. The way it's presented really sucks you in to the environments. When you look into the distance, you'll see faint red lights, almost like strange monster eyes staring at you. You'll focus on those and as you get closer, you'll see its just boat lights, or something else.\n\nThird is the graphics. They're much much better than all the previous games. Models included. The Amnesia/Penumbra series never did very well with models or animations, and while they still aren't the best, they are very good compared to the previous games in the series,\n\nA bit on the monsters without any spoilers really. They also actively get better as the game progresses. You get a little taste of Amnesia Dark Decent style monster as well.\n\nNow for the final part, I'll talk about the character a bit, and a tiny nothing about the story. There won't be any spoilers at all. This part reminds me a lot of Penumbra. The main character is a bit of a normal dude, and I think he's a bit TOO normal for my tastes, but once again as you progress in the story I think he does well. There's a lot of psychological parts in the game where your main character, Simon, will probably be parroting your own thoughts fairly well, and it honestly does make you think about your own sense of self. If you are into that, that is. I realize that not everyone really cares about that.\n\nThis probably comes down to personal taste, but I really liked Daniel from Dark Decent. But I don't think a character like this would work in this game at all, really. I think it was a bit necessary for Simon to be a very normal guy, so it's kind of up to you on that. I can understand complaints about Simon possibly being too boring.\n\nI think I have rambled enough here and will try to end the review finally and sum up my thoughts. Soma is a great story game. The gameplay has been slightly too stripped for my taste, but they handle it pretty well and do keep you occupied and playing as it goes on. Sound, lighting, graphics are great and make an amazing atmosphere. The best atmosphere in the series. (I say series because I think Soma is also linked to the previous games in someway or another.)\n\nJust keep in mind that this game is still a bit of a walking simulator. If you are okay with that, then I think you will really enjoy this interesting and genuinely scary game. (although I am scared of everything.) There's also basically no jumpscares in the game, which I appreciate a lot. I say basically, because the one that did happen was probably my fault for looking around in the wrong directions.\n\nSo if this sounds good to you, go for it. I think it's worth the price.","September 27, 2015","true","15.2"," 48 of 56 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","48","56","4","3"

I tend to scare myself before the monster gets a chance. So its safe to say this game a fair bit out my my comfort zone or so I thought.\n\nI had heard of this game a while back but I had dismissed it completely being another traverse the scary dark hallway game and wait for the monster to get you. Until someone brought it back up and I decided to actually give it a chance. The second I saw a robot unconvincingly speaking to the player regarding his robotic body I was sold. I didn't even care if this game was going make me poop my pants or not.\n\nI had some major snafus however, it would be better for me to just list them and get them out there to ward off would be haters of early criticism.\n\n- This game frequently crashes, I'd say around 10 times all throughout. Which wouldn't have been a huge issue if I had not been forced to sit through the same dialogue and repeat puzzle sections. I will mention however you can save anytime yourself (down to your exact position) though it requires leaving the game and returning after a loading screen.\n\n-The monsters are not super scary. Even for me. Hiding and waiting is not fun. There is no way to stop the creatures from.. doing whatever it is they do to you when they get too close.\n\n- The game seems to be poorly optimized. Chugging for no apparent reason other then having a difficult time loading the next area. Texture pop in and single digit frame rate. I'm running a GTX770 and should have no problem getting 60 frames even at max settings which brings me to my next point.\n\n- The visual, GFX, video settings leave something to be desired. The only AA option being FXAA. Which is better than none I suppose. There are still options for Bloom, V-sync and SSAO but that's about it. There are many particles floating about so its only natural to expect some frame droppage from time to time even in a dimly lit corridor but chugging to single digits and crashing, frequently, just seems like poor optimization.\n\nNow for the good bits.\n\nThe story is the main draw here. I am a self professed 'fan' of narratively driven games. I hate doing things without context and there is no shortage of that here.\n\nThe prologue introduces you to the mechanics of the analog control over things and general overview of who the player character is. Without revealing too much Simon is essentially a guinea pig for an experimental treatment for a condition causing very strenuous headaches. Being as ambiguous as possible, the treatment requires placement in a machine in which brain scans take place. A sort of new age MRI. Simon takes a seat, the machine starts and so does the adventure.\n\nI really really like the story, its excellently told. The voice acting is excellent, The world building is great and it will make you want to explore to find another terminal or notepad to read another email or scribblings of minds gone awry. The ending is very satisfying and altogether perplexing in the aspect of what the term 'alive' actually means. I'd go as far as to say that humans of any variety lack the vocabulary necessary to convey the idea properly.\n\nI love the art direction and level design so much, that at times I wish there were a way to stop the creatures from being around. As in, have the tense moment of fear and satisfaction from outsmarting the enemy but then allow the player to explore the environment unimpeded. Now the strange aspect of the creatures is they are very lumbering and sort of silly, almost lobotomized. As long as your flashlight is off and you're crouched you become almost completely invisible. And in the off chance you are caught. (They sense you electromagnetically, very lore friendly) They are easily outrun. I'm told it has a very Alien Isolation feeling to the tension.\n\nYour character is able to get what are essentially audio files from dead corpses and other devices for reasons I'd rather have you explore yourself to find out. The reason I even bother to mention this is when listening to these files your character is immobile which for pacing reasons seems like an odd choice.\n\nThe story seems to pull from a number of different areas for inspiration. I don't mean to name drop as I don't believe mechanically it compares but as far as story elements go it reminded me of games such as System Shock 2, Cradle, and The Fall. As well as other sources such as Hugh Howeys Wool series, or his short story Halfway Home. Which I absolutely adore all of those and wholeheartedly recommend as well.\n\nThis came out of nowhere for me and I'm glad I didn't miss it. To be honest the last game that blindsided me this bad was the original Dead Space.","September 23, 2015","true","9.4"," 33 of 40 people (83%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","83","33","40","7","0"

See the “Tips” section below for more details.\n\nThe Long Version Upon finished SOMA, I can safely say that Frictional Games, the Swedish dev renowned for psychotic horror titles such as Penumbra and Amnesia series, has outdone themselves once again, I was amazed by how much thought was put into this game, as well as the emotional impact it creates. It’s a masterpiece in certain aspects yet falls short in others, the details are explained below in sections(*slight spoiler alert*):\n\nStory 9.5/10:\nWhy SOMA isn’t your average horror game is that it puts more emphasis on the story rather than horror itself, a sci-fi fan can easily pick up the core concept of SOMA because it features similar elements from classic titles such as Total Recall, Blade Runner, 2001: A Space Odyssey and Bioshock series, yet by combining them with excellent narrative and presentation the devs still managed to create a unique feeling out of SOMA, during the gameplay I stopped more than once to think about the plot details, and watching the ending made me totally speechless for a while. The tradeoff, however, is a bit “story over gameplay” in this title and I can understand this might be frowned upon by some fans, but I applaud Frictional Games for willing to take risks in creating such a compelling experience.\n\nPresentation & Narrative 9/10:\nYou find yourself in an abandoned hi-tech base haunted by crazy monsters, while you have to find notes and solve puzzles to advance the story, well this is what we’ve done for 1000 times in other games. However this seamlessly fits in SOMA’s setting, as you navigate through the vintage style computer interface and read scientific reports throughout Pathos II, the story gradually unveils itself in a unique but cohesive way. My only gripe about the story is that the protagonist, despite being hinted multiple times about his ultimate fate, only to realize the situation in the last few seconds, this “dumbed down” feels forced and not clever writing.\n\nSound 8/10\nAnother feature that makes SOMA stand out is excellent in-game sound design, the ambient sound like machine beeping , distant monster groaning, suspicious noise like footsteps, as well as the water flowing sound in the sea walking levels are all amazingly done, which creates a unique, immersive and haunting feeling. The music, while I didn’t feel its existence for most part of the game, did reminds me of scores from Blade Runner and Space Odyssey in later part, and it complements the atmosphere gloriously.\nI found most of the NPC voice acting very well done and Catherine’s voice is especially brilliant, but I can’t say the same for the main protagonist’s voice: it’s unnaturally calm considering all the things happening around him, and for most part it feels like a student reading a textbook, while this more or less explains his not-so-smart mind it just takes away lots of immersion the game manages to create.\n\nGraphics & performance 8.5/10:\nSlightly outdated but gets the job done fairly well, there’re some low-res textures here and there as well as color banding issues, but the game looks really beautiful during the seabed walking scenes and in the later interior levels due to the well used lighting. Early on I’ve heard lots of complaints about the game’s performance issues but in my play-through I experienced no stutter and bugs, so I guess the early issues have all been fixed.\n\nGameplay 7.9/10:\nAs I previously mentioned, the whole Pathos II base is presented to the player with remarkable detail and authenticity, you can pick up a large variety of small objects as well as drag-open doors & drawers in a realistic way, although the physics in this game is more cosmetic and doesn’t play a vital part as in titles like Half-life 2, it adds a great amount of immersion to the gameplay.\nHowever, the “real” gameplay is a mixed bag for me, despite walking on the seabed chased by monsters is nothing short of thrill and brilliance, and the fact that the devs tried to create a diversity of monster behaviors, the core mechanics (crouch, peek & hide) coupled with the chromatic aberration screen effect caused by panic/ monster attacks inevitably make the gameplay more like a chore than interesting interaction, especially in the later phase, like you’re in a pitch dark room but can’t use flashlight since that will immediately attract the monster, as well as some linear and uninspiring chase scene, this makes the last 1/3 part of the game more like an interactive movie and less like a video game, which is kinda disappointing.\n\nRecommendation: If you’re a fan of psychotic horror games and good story, this is a must buy for full price to support the indie developer. However if you’re less interested in the story and prefer more “hardcore” horror gameplay you may want to pick this up on sales, because the gameplay is kinda weak and game can be finished under 10 hours.\n\nTips:\n-	For gamers can’t deal with the monster encounters I recommend the  WUSS mod, this makes most of the monster in-game harmless and allows you to freely explore the levels to fully enjoy the awesome story.\n-	You can use  ReShade/SweetFx[sfx.thelazy.net] to enhance the slightly dated graphics, post process effects like Depth of Field, Ambient Occlusion, Tonemap, Vibrance and Curve work wonders on the dull vanilla colors.\n-	You can enable the debug mode to utilize developer features like quick save (F9) and quick load (F10), as well as pause game (F2) and free camera (F7), the latter is handy for taking screenshots.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=630072241\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=631666779\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=632130179\n\nIf you got more useful tips please feel free to share with me, I’ll be glad to add them here.","February 26","true","29.7"," 22 of 22 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","22","22","0","0"

One of the most memorable game experiences I've had in the last several years.\n\nGAMEPLAY: If you've played Amnesia: The Dark Descent or Penumbra: Black Plague, you know what to expect - first person controls, click on objects to pick them up and throw them around, and sneaking around monsters with no combat option, so you'd best get used to hiding. Strangely, most puzzles in the game don't make use of the physics engine as they did in Frictional's previous titles, typically taking the form of using a computer in some form - for example, using hints provided to select the right settings to run a simulation. It's a bit of a disappointment, as it feels like the physics engine is only there because it's a Frictional game - there are only a handful of occasions in which it's used to progress the game. Otherwise, your time will be spent exploring the environment looking for key items to progress the story. It's straightforward and functional.\n\nGRAPHICS: The game looks nice, the underwater effects being particularly noteworthy - murky water is mildly illuminated by blurry lights on the ocean floor, as fish swim around you. The human character models are a bit awkward, having a bit of a robotic quality (which jars a bit against the REAL robots in the game), but there aren't many of them to be seen, so it isn't much of an issue. The environments are richly detailed, full of books, small statues, and other miscellaneous objects that make it all feel much more genuine. It feels like real people inhabited these areas - especially when you find the notes and pictures (which can be picked up and closely examined). My only real issues were a few frame rate drops, and that the facilities suffer from the usual problem of looking somewhat bland. I'm not quite sure who decided that all research facilities have to be completely sterile looking, but I don't blame people for going insane in these places.\n\nAUDIO: A huge variety of sound effects, used effectively - some of my most memorable moments come from screeching radio static and the noises of some of the robots. There was great care put into the sound design, and it shows, adding a more realistic feeling to the game. Music isn't a critical factor, with most of the audio coming in-game - footsteps, rushing water, bumps and bangs, etc.\nThe voice acting is generally quite good, being emotive and natural sounding, though coming off as a bit stinted in places. Catherine in particular was acted very well, and one robot in particular early in the game gave me my first real shock with its mechanical and distorted, yet human voice.\n\nENEMIES: Varied and creepy, they do their job and they do it well. Though two I would say are a bit unoriginal, they still provide scares as needed. As noted, you will be sneaking around them rather than fighting, and it works just as well as in previous entries. The biggest problem is that they aren't given a very satisfactory explanation - though it's mentioned how they came to be, a little background story into what made these creatures the way they are individually (each one encountered is very different) would have added a bit to it - even just a memo or a piece of dialogue now and again. As it stands, they feel like a bit of an afterthought, and clash with the tone of the game a bit.\n\nENVIRONMENTS: The bottom of the ocean is a good setting for a horror (themed) game, and it was a nice change of pace compared to the usual hosptial, old castle, abandoned town, etc. of horror fare. You will be in one of two areas, typically: a laboratory/living quarters, or on the ocean floor, with some extras at the beginning and end of the game. As mentioined, they're very nicely detailed, and give off more of a mystery vibe than outright horror. There isn't a lot of decay and darkness here - they feel alive, or places that hosted life not so long ago. The segments between ocean and laboratory are spaced out pretty nicely, so they don't become tedious, which is important - it keeps the player on their toes, and prevents tediousness (I'm looking squarely at you, Alien: Isolation).\n\nHORROR: This isn't an outright horror game as were the Amnesia and Penumbra titles. It's more horror-THEMED, with emphasis on more sci-fi elements, and there isn't much of the slow, lonely, tension-building oppression of the great horror titles. Which is fine - this game knows what it's doing. In fact, I think that type of horror would have clashed with this game's narrative, which necessitated having a compaion for Simon to work out the mysteries of the game. The horror elements that ARE present, however, are very effective due to their being spaced apart. The player is given time to become comfortable and let down their guard, only to be preyed upon again, a concept which some horror games have somehow failed to grasp (hang your heads in shame, Alien and Evil Within). It won't terrify you like Amnesia, but it's good for some tense scares along the way.\n\nSTORY: This is where the game shines. Its story asks tough questions of the player, and asks them to make tough decisions. The narrative has Simon go for a brain scan in relation to an injury, only to re-emerge in a lab on the ocean floor with no clue as to how he got there. As he traverses the facility, he - and the player - will have to (attempt to) discern what it means to be human, among other smaller, related questions. It made me think, and the ending had me sitting and looking at my floor as the credits rolled. It's been quite some time since a game has touched me as SOMA has, and that's what makes it so worthwhile. It's not perfect - there are a few changes I would have made to the pacing, and there's a character that's introduced fairly late in the game that feels like an afterthought - but overall, it's well worth the journey.\n\nOverall, SOMA isn't hugely innovative in terms of gameplay, graphics, etc. But its story is what makes it so worthwhile. It's nice to see Frictional create such a thoughtful and emotional narrative after becoming known for games primarily focused on raw horror. I could recommend this game to just about anyone other than those who are easily scared.","October 25, 2015","true","10.5"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","26","29","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dracaerys/recommended/282140/","Dracaerys","Night Druid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dracaerys/","282 products in account","SOMA is an ambitious work of science fiction which grapples with questions of consciousness and what it truly means to be human.Things never get boring in SOMA, thanks to an engaging story.\n\nThe developer, Frictional Games, are masters of the survival horror genre, and it shows, as some areas invoke fear before you even see a monstrous robotic being. I expected nothing less from the developer behind Amnesia: The Dark Descent and I have to say, they've out done themselves this time.\n\nWhile some scares are unquestionably intense and terrifying, other monsters like the one you meet in Lambda are more annoying than scary.  The other half of the game consists of puzzle-solving and exploration making this game feel more open than the previous Penumbra or Amnesia games. However, at times and particularly in under water sections, the freedom creates unfortunate pacing problems.  I found the lack of maps / "you are here" signs in the under water section hindered my progression. I was irritated that I spent almost 2 hours at one particular station looking for a zepplin control panel to take me to the next area.  There is no marking to indicate where your next objective lies, and a great deal of time can be spent trying to find things.\n\nStory!\nLike the very best horror stories, SOMA maintains an unsettling level of ambiguity and dread, which has you doubting everyone and everything around you. The main character, Simon, wakes up aboard a dilapidated, abandoned research facility at the bottom of the ocean shortly after having his brain scanned by a doctor.\nThe prequel story of PATHOS 2 can be pieced together by frequently encountered (but often unreliable) black-boxes. It’s genuinely disconcerting, and few games play with ambiguity so well while telling a story that players can follow.\n\nSimon’s awakening is prefaced by a famous quote from Philip K. ♥♥♥♥: “Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn’t go away.” The quote alludes to the particular type of uncertainty at play; as you soon meet a variety of malfunctioning robots who talk and behave like they are real humans.\n\nYou soon realise these robots don’t perceive themselves to be machines at all, since they’re running digital and identical copies of a person’s mind scanned for the A.R.K Project.  This plot point opens your mind to philosophical questions to be tackled. At first, Simon thinks these machines are being remote-controlled, functioning as avatars for people located elsewhere.\n\nThese robots aren’t sleek, fleshy androids like the "Working Joes" in Alien Isolation.\nAlthough slightly bipedal, they’re rusty, broken-down heaps of metal, spewing oil, yet this only intensifies the tragedy of the situation. They believe themselves to be human, and can’t understand why you can’t see them as such.\n\nIt’s simultaneously intriguing and tragic, and when you’re given the choice to unplug these machines or "save them", SOMA throws up some fascinating dilemmas which I’ve thought more and more about since finishing it.\nDid I do the right thing by killing Amy? Or could I have saved her? Should I have saved Carl instead of electrocuting him?\nThese were questions I asked myself upon dealing with their consequences.\n\n\nHide and Seek Gameplay\nSOMA is fascinating on multiple levels. It has fewer original ideas than amnesia did, but ultimately it’s built upon the framework of Amnesia with the ‘hide in a corner crying as the monster slowly approaches’ feel to the gameplay.\n\nGameplay involves cowering in corners or behind doors waiting for the big bad thing to lose interest and wander out of the area you happen to be in. The robots infected by a rogue, self-replicating AI are intimidating and scary, but after a while they become frustrating since there’s no discernible way to avoid them.\n\nFor instance, Amnesia had a mechanic at your disposal that gave the player the ability to pick up objects and throw them to lure a creature away to investigate a noise. Sadly, the mechanic has been removed from SOMA.\n\nPuzzles!\nExploration and puzzle-solving fill in the rest of SOMA’s gameplay. While some of its research stations are dimly-lit and streaked with blood, there’s a surprising amount of variety to be discovered. Horrible, claustrophobic places where cables wrap around objects like sinew on bone. In fact, one of SOMA’s most consistently terrifying sequences takes place in the Mariana trench and there’s a rather hungry sea creature after you.\nPuzzles are more infuriating, however. There are a couple of decent ones, with some of the best puzzles being linked to SOMA’s premise.\nIt entails booting up a ‘person’s’ consciousness and manipulating their reality via an operating system, in order to extract valuable information. It made me think about how people torture Sims and I found that it wasnt so different...\n\n\nVerdict:SOMA is an interesting game, its a masterpiece of both horror and storytelling.\nIt's horrific setting, monsters, choices and dark subject give this game a unique feel even if the horror genre is over done in todays market.\n\nScore:\n9/10","October 16, 2015","true","19.0"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","27","31","0","1"

Much of the story is told with audio files, and character interaction, but there is more to learn if you want to take the time to explore, and discover written logs for more backstory. The story was extremely well done, and I enjoyed all of it. The experience was definitely a memorable one.\n\nThe game is not a horror in your typical sense. It’s not loaded with jump scares like a lot of other horror games, but instead it relies on the eerie, immersive atmosphere, and the potential presence of creatures to keep you on your toes. I didn’t really feel scared, or have my heart racing like parts of Amnesia made me feel.\n\nThe creatures in SOMA were very strange, and creepy. You can’t look at them for very long, or most of them will attack. You have no weapons, and you have to run, and hide if you catch their attention. There is a visual effect that shows you when monsters were near, and I would hide and be waiting, and I could tell that the creatures were getting closer, thinking to myself “please go away…”\n\nSome parts of the game, made me feel like a horrible person; the things the games makes you do, and the choices that the games lets you make on your own. It really made me think about the value of life, and sometimes made me questions my very own thoughts, ideals, and decisions.\n\nPros:the characters were completely realistic, and the backstory, and their behaviours were believable and made sense\nthe story was extremely well done, and the experience was a memorable one that will last\nSOMA was more about suspense, and fear of the unknown, instead of relying on jump scares; it’s a psychological horror that gets inside your head, and really makes you think about the story as you start putting it all together\nthe voice acting was impeccable, sound effects, and music were done very well, and the audio was extremely immersive (especially in the parts where you were in the water outside of the buildings looked and sounded fantastic)\nthe graphics were great throughout the game, creating a dark and immersive world\nthere are some community made mods that look interesting, and might be worth checking out\nsome parts in the game will stick with you long after playing\nCons:when the auto saves happened, I would have a very brief stutter until it finished, but it was always quick and not too frequent or disruptive\nThe game took me about 12-13 hours (I played the first few hours offline), exploring as much as I could. Since the story is linear, I don’t feel the need to replay it. It’s been over a week since I played SOMA, and I still feel guilty thinking back to some parts of the game, and that stuff is going to stay with me a while.\n\nI’ve wanted to play SOMA since it was released, and I’ve had a few people suggest that I play it, but I was hesitant to spend the full price, so I waited for a sale, but I would not have been disappointed if I had paid full price. A game that makes me reflect on the things I did, and the choices I made for days and weeks after playing... just wow… SOMA was an amazing game, and I highly recommend it for those looking for a psychological horror story.","May 23","true","9.9"," 24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","24","27","2","6"

I was not disappointed, though I was somewhat surprised to find that SOMA was very different from the previous games.  The horror this time around is less sequence focused and much more story focused. The game itself is very heavily story focused, much moreso than the Penumbra and Amnesia, however it does absolutely does NOT become a walking simulator like AAMFP.\n\nVisuals are significantly improved over the previous games as well, with much more detail, outdoor areas, and overall feeling much more present and alive. The lighting is top-notch, though it does seem like they didn't quite make the most of the deferred system, still lacking methods such as volumetric lighting and radiosity. Textures, although well done, should have shipped higher res. Despite the texture shortcoming, it sill looks phenomenal at any resolution, including 4K\nThe downside is that SOMA is much harder to run as well, occasionally getting slowdowns to around 20-30 FPS.\n\nSound design is masterful in SOMA, the sound and visuals combining to create the all important horror atmosphere in a manner I can only call flawless, and I would argue that SOMA has some of the greatest sound design of any game I had ever played. The soundtrack is a bit more subtle this time around, but at many times it has a fitting Vangelis-esque feel to it.\n\nGameplay is pretty much the same as Amnesia and Penumbra, but much more exploration and discovery oriented rather than fully horror oriented. The puzzles are fewer and smaller as well.\n\nThe story is where this game shines; It is dark, beautiful, thought-provoking, and can even be heavily emotional at times. This will certainly be a strong contender for the best game story of 2015. Additionally, SOMA has now claimed the title of best story in a horror game from Silent Hill 2.\n\nOverall verdict: RECOMMEND IT - Those who absolutely loved Amnesia and other Frictional games should buy it ASAP to experience before it becomes too widespread on youtube. Those who were not so much fans of Amnesia, but seek a very well-told Science Fiction story and an atmosphere to be immersed in may wait for a sale or price drop.","September 24, 2015","true","23.6"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","21","24","0","1"

Really like how you actually have time to experience the story and actually pay attention to the notes and various details. Unlike Amnesia: The Dark Descent you are just constantly running around and just doing puzzles but story does not get through, in SOMA the story is rich enough so that it does not have to be stretched like a rubber band in previous Amnesia games. The narrative relies on 2 parts, just the main story line and you figuring out puzzles and various side narrative puzzles that help you understand the world even better.\n\nThe game can definatly be scary and spooky but its just the right amount of down time and scary time. Since if a game is so stressful all the time like Amnesia The Dark Descent, instead of feeling like "man what an awesome game", you feel like "man I'm such a hero for finishing such a scary game, but not truly appreciating the game as a whole". With SOMA you feel like it is a seamless experience and puzzles, atmosphere and the scares have a good flow to them. I also like how this game does not rely on jump scares but is still scary during encounters.\n\nAnother great factor is that different creatures/monsters give you different types of scares. Which is again unlike Amnesia is not OMG thats the Grunt run run run, or the actual nightmare monster run run run. Even though they are different monsters they feel the same. In SOMA the distinction is there which is awesome for variety and experience.","September 22, 2015","true","7.0"," 50 of 75 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","50","75","0","2"

This is their best looking and most atmospheric game yet, with tense interiors and isolating ocean walks. The variety of creatures and locations is quite surprising and progression is steady thanks to good horror pacing and increasing unease. The tension is complemented by an intriguing story and a large cast of voiced characters. Interactivity within the world is basic and logical, but it still proves valuable and keeps the player firmly grounded in the world. With more complicated puzzles and a greater challenge, it would have been almost perfect.

It explores some seriously interesting concepts, in slow but thought-provoking ways that have stuck with me for days after completing the game.\n\nThe game environments are detailed and engaging, there is a lot of backstory that can be found by searching around. The locations are varied and there's a gritty but down-to-earth feel to the locations and details that aids the suspension of disbelief.\n\nOne thing that really impressed me is the game treats you with a good deal of respect. Often you have to figure out the next step on your journey, often simple enough, but the game world follows some simple rules and it trusts you to figure out what to do. A vital door doesn't open? Check power panels... something burnt out? Find a replacement part. There are a dozen little puzzles like this in the game where you have the agency to look and figure out what to do yourself, without a quest pop-up or an NPC explaining it to you step-by-step. It sounds simple, but it really adds to the feeling of reality in the game, and is so much more satisfying.\n\nOverall, a scary game (not TOO scary, I couldn't handle Amnesia but I made it through this) that plays around with interesting concepts and explores them in a way that really gets you thinking. Highly recommended.","October 3, 2015","true","17.1"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

I was recommended to try it after having played, and spoken highly of, The Talos Principle by Croteam. While SOMA is a horror game it has many common elements with The Talos Principle, namely the philosophy. SOMA isn't just a horror game about evading monsters, it's a story about humanity and consciousness.\nObviously I won't spoil the story, you should go into it with as little prior information as possible. During the playthrough I often had to stop for a day to fully assimilate the story, and take it all in. While it doesn't necessarily present any new ideas, it presents them very well.\n\nThe atmosphere of the game is just incredible, I really felt like I was there on the bottom of the ocean. The environments were realistically modeled, everything looked like you would expect a real submerged base to look. Both graphics and sound was top notch.\n\nI have one major complaint, though: the monsters are simply frustrating! Luckily there are not many of them, but when you run into them, you wish they weren't there. They are relatively scary, true, but mostly they are just a frustration that stops you from going where you wish to go, or do what you need to do. Often I had to sit in a corner for several minutes and wait until a monster left the vicinity, before I could get on with the task at hand. I don't think the game would have suffered much from having no monsters, or at least they should have been better done.\n\nWhile this isn't so much a review as my rambling thoughts, I can 100% recommend this game if you are interested in philosophy, or just want to experience an incredibly atmospheric game. It is among the best games I've ever played, even if it isn't THE best. The only thing detracting a bit form the experience is the monsters, as I noted above.","May 7","true","10.3"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","0"

This is an evolution of the template laid out by Amnesia to tell a kind of story that hasn't been explored this well in the medium before.

In fact, they have little to no effect on the story. But you feel them nontheless. Your choices can haunt you.\n\nThe game, like most, leans on the trope of audio and text message logs to help fill in the story. In this case, I felt they were *just* long enough to not wear out their welcome. There is also a lot of environmental storytelling that encourages you to let your imagination run wild.\n\nI'm usually pretty bad at traditional adventure games but I was able to complete the game with no outside help.

While you are exploring the incredibly well made envoirement -which reminds a lot of Bioshock-, a deep and thrilling story goes along with you.\nBecause of heavy spoilers I will go through this review without any more information about the story itself. Yet one thing is worth mentioning: Be advised that this game will not leave you in the dark but only reveals the information inch-by-inch what might keep you playing forward till the bitter end. A very positive aspect which makes the game worth playing forward.\n\nAs already wrote above the envoirement of Soma really reminds of Bioshock, which isn't a bad thing at all. The illumination and detailed graphics are stunning and no HUD will destroy the wow-effect when you reach new places. Speaking of which: You never feel like you were in that place before. Every new section hides new content to explore and new ways will open for the curiosity of the player. It's worth to inspect every corner no matter how small, it might have burried important information to understand the whole story a bit more.\n\nFor the special spine-chilling effect you should use headphones and turn up the volume. Every small tone, a breathing, a step or even whispering will make your hair stand on end in areas which seem to be quiet at first. The english voice acting is remarkable, every sentence is spoke with sensation and you start to get into the spirit of the protagonist and his surroundings.\n\nFor those who are used to the controls of Amnesia won't find anything different in Soma. You are able to interact nearly with everything in your proximity with well working physics. From the possibility to open and close doors as slow as you want, to throw away things you find on your way. Only the inventory confuses at the beginning. You can't recourse to it to combine items for a puzzle. Items you have picked up will appear again when you are at the correct  place to use it. Caused from this you might stand in a room without knowing what to do. Whatsoever, after a little search in the rooms you will get the conclusion fast and continue with the further course.\n\nIt's a deadly hide and seek game with the enemies you encounter. Hide as good as you can but if they see you run for it. It is your only chance to stay alive. This shematics are similar to Alien: Isolation and not everytime a good part of the game. To pass the sections will be a challenge but with a bit of patience you can go on with the story. Don't try to fight them, you will get the short end of the stick.\n\n▐▐░░▒▒▓▓ To cut the long story short ▓▓▒▒░░▐▐\n\nSoma is one of the indie survival horror games that kept my attention from the very second on. Through the fact that this game reveals the story only step by step I didn't want to just close the game to take a break. This game won't frighten you just with simple jump scares. The whole atmosphere appeals crushing - a feeling that every second something could happen. Horrifying sightings make you think about it minutes after and still the story has to go on.\n\n▐▐░░▒▒▓▓ Scoring ▓▓▒▒░░▐▐\n\nGameplay: 8.0/10.0\nGraphics: 9.0/10.0\nControls: 10.0/10.0 (Shematics of Amnesia)\nSounds: 10.0/10.0\nGame Length: Aprox. 10 hours\nRecommendable: Absolutely recommendable to people who love deep stories with a frightening atmosphere.\n\nAll in all: 10.0/10.0","September 29, 2015","true","12.4"," 20 of 26 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","20","26","2","0"

(well if you have a reason to go every week that is) and has his whole World flipped upside down, literally. I won't go too much into the story, I wouldn't like to spoil it for you, but the game is twisted, and after your brain scan, you wake up over 100 years into the future, underwater.\n\nThe game has a phenomenal soundtrack, whether you're safe or near an enemy, there's always going to be a sound or effect that keeps the hairs on your balls standing tall. There are plenty of memories and buffers to find, which opens up a vast story through the minds of other people that were in the station(s) long before you appeared there to 'clean up' the mess.\n\nThere are a variety of different monsters/creatures/robots/whatever the hell they are to avoid, sneak past and ♥♥♥♥ing run from. Some will have you confused, worried and running with a heavy heartbeat. Checking a guide would help but I highly recommend just going in with little information and having the thrill of ♥♥♥♥ing yourself over a few times.\n\nThe graphics are very good, and effective.

There were some areas of low perfomance with FPS but after an update earlier on, these seemed to have been fixed, alongwith loading times being slightly better.\n\nMy opinion of this game is 10/10, would not play again, for the simple fact that it's tremendous and scary.

During this routine scan something appears to go wrong and you wake up 100 years later, inside an underwater station overrun with robots.\n\nThis really is a well crafted and believable world, it takes a lot of cues from other games like Bioshock and System Shock. Where as in Bioshock you felt like the ocean was taking the city of Rapture back, in SOMA you get this sense of machinery taking over everything, as large robotic appendages jut out of walls and block hallways and corridors.\n\nThere's about 5 different monster types in the game, all of which you simply have to avoid. We've seen this kind of thing in dozens of first person horror games lately, the enemy patrols around an enclosed area and you have to collect something in that area or just get through it unseen.\n\nAt it's core, SOMA is a casual horror game for people who can't handle inventory and resource management and who find the idea of a health bar off putting. People looking for a hardcore horror game set underwater, avoiding murderous robots and scraping by for resources might want to look elsewhere.\n\nFull video review:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aacV3EmIdqk","September 23, 2015","true","6.9"," 35 of 54 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","35","54","2","7"

All in which the sound design excels aswell where actors did a great job at making it sound very believeable.\n\nIt's been a while since I've been so immersed in a game before, I did not expect to be so damn emotional about it!\n\nI can heartly recommend this game to anyone who is looking for great philosophical horror sci-fi story. While retaining some of the puzzle elements of the previous games.","September 25, 2015","true","17.4"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","14","16","0","1"

I've played Amnesia: The dark descent (though I never could finish it), but I think the two are quite different.\n\nThe story and pacing of this game are fantastic. Apart from a few sections where I felt my progress was being held back by the devs trying too hard to make me feel uncomfortable or push a bit of backstory, the whole thing flows like a long movie.\n\nThe scares become annoyances pretty quickly, but having said that I never really lost the feeling of immersion and every new chapter had me willing to give the game another chance.\n\nPick up this game, play it just for the story.

Its been very long since a game made me feel so much. One of the most immersive and present experiences Ive had and I can see it being very well represented on VR platforms. But this game was more for me. As a narrative it dealt with things that not many books even have. Themes present throughout SOMA are real life theories and philosophies that I was aware of before hand. But the way they are tied in together is so beautifully done. The writing, the characters, the setting, everything was done so perfectly to me. I ultimately am happy, proud, and excited that SOMA is what it is. Its finally an example that you could show to an outside person as an example of the medium being used as an artistic narrative. This is an experience, one that captivates such as books and movies do, but on such a deeper and more personal level, and I hope we see more like it.

For his cure he has to take medicine frequently and also get his brain scanned by a doctor, who invites him to his office at the beginning of the game. But as soon as the scan begins you realize that something went terribly wrong, waking up in a completely other place and the doctor disappearing. I don't want to reveal more since it would spoiler the main story, so I'm just going for the pro's and con's of the game I've experienced so far.\n\nThe Pro's\n+ Frictional games has learned from it's previous developed games in terms of graphics, sound and storytelling\n+ Different pictures, E-Mails, audiologs and letters reveal parts of the story and open questions\n+ Fully explorable environment, so taking your time looking for clues of the story will pay off\n+ A very unsettling and deep atmosphere, supported by the amazing soundtrack of composer Mikko Tarmia, who already developed the soundtrack of the Penumbra series and Amnesia: The Dark Descent\n+ The character you play and those you meet are interesting and also extraordinary\n+ There aren't as many jumpscares as in Amnesia, but that's not a bad point. The maps are bigger and there is more to explore. In addition to that the stressful moments of the game are really well timed and intense\n\n\nThe Con's\n- There is no real replayability\n- Some textures look stale and should be fixed\n- Occasional FPS drops ...\n- ... leading to frustrating deaths\n\n\nThe Verdict\nAfter all the game achieved what it intended to become: a thrilling, atmospheric and story driven horror experience.\nSo if you are interested in any type of horror game you should definitely give this one a shot.\n\n\n\nRiehviuh (doitsch)\nAaaaaaaaaaalder.

In retrospect I believe that this is mostly due to the resource gathering and subsequent managment, which is of course a great mechanic for creating its own prevailing sense of tension i.e never having enough resources and watching what you do possess slowly drain away. Soma can't quite match this horror because it doesn't have resource gathering. Which is perhaps the only downer and carryover from the disappointing 'A Machine for Pigs'. But something I can easily forgive in light of everything else.\n\nBut the story of SOMA.... Oh, the story of SOMA is something quite glorious!! It is up there with the very best of anything I've ever played before, and crushes most. It really is a stunning piece of work. I was utterly consumed by it, and it left me pondering questions everytime I finished a session and turned my PC off. The nature of reality, what reality is, what defines the real "me" and what it means to be human - the story is able to deliver these otherwise potentially exhausting and overwhelming theological subjects in an interesting way.\n\nYes, the gameplay is solid, the horror is there, as are the puzzles (though easier and less tactile than the Dark Descent). The oppressive and rich atmosphere, the good (in some cases stunning) visuals, the serviceable voice acting etc. No resource gathering but otherwise everything you'd expect from Frictional. But the story raises the whole thing beyond the realms of good and into something that is quite magnificent. (At least imo).\n\nSoma was, for me, an incredible experience, a gem of a game that rarely comes along. Like a great book that you can't put down. This game was unforgettable.","October 3, 2015","true","18.1"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

I lurk in the shawdows and pushed my luck against the elements just to unravel more of the story. Never have I been so enthralled about a tale from game and never has it been on such an epic scale.

Its the kind of game where you think of it as more than just "a game". When I first discovered Frictional Games, I played Amnesia: The Dark Descent. I was instantly blown away by the enviromental perfection, and I went on to purchase and complete the Pneumbra Series and Machine for Pigs. I have been patiently awaiting the arrival of this masterpiece, and It is everything I had hoped for and more.\n\nSOMA take you on a mind-bending journey through time, causing you to question what conciousness is, who you are, and if the reality around you truly exists. At every turn down dark corridors and undersea caverns laced with electronic abstractions, you will be presented with philisophical conundrums as your character faces fear in the form of existence itself. The scariest thing about this horror game is not the well thought out monsters roaming the walls of this seemingly endless research facility, its the sudden realization that you and I may not exist in the way we believe. Its the fact that our realities could very well be illusions constructed by chemicals. These thoughts and more colorfully spring themselves to life as you explore the immersive, intricate world of SOMA.\n\nAt every footstep, your character breaths, their heart beats, and their voice shreiks just like you do. Everytime something terrifying occured, I found myself feeling just as the characters did, attempting to run away from the horrors. I literally feared death, especially because dying in SOMA will make your heart race. It will make you scream. This attention to character reaction makes it very easy to connect to Simon, the main protaganist in SOMA. I highly recommend wearing a high quality pair of headphones during your experience as you lead him throughout this adventure. As you roam the halls of PATHOS-II, strange, mechanical gurgling, the massive roars of deep sea creatures in the distance, the dripping of black goo melting down the walls, and the shifting of metal and rock fills the thin air.

Do we exist? What is the meaning of life? Is there life after death? All of these questions are asked and it's up to you to find the answers.\n\nSoma seems to have one of the most immersive sci-fi atmospheres I've ever encountered in a game. It's well thought out and full of little clues here and there if you are willing to explore.\n\nDo not buy this game if you're looking for a monster game in the vain of Amnesia, while the game does have a few monsters, it's not based heavily on them. Instead, this game focuses on the story and character development. It's a game for thinkers, not for people looking for thrills or a haunted house experience. The game is built more around using stealth and solving puzzle solving. You must find your way to different bases in an underwater environment. Sometimes it will make you feel truly claustrophobic, other times it will make you feel a sense of relief on your journey.\n\nSoma has a great sense of vulnerability, you can't fight back throughout the game at all... Actually, you can't do alot of things but that doesn't mean the game isn't fun. The game successfully delivers what it set out to do and ehat is that exactly? Simple. Soma engages the player in one of the most original and compelling stories of 2015. It draws you in with it's deep story-writing and does so with it's own set of unique tools that we (as gamers) are not used to.\n\nPros  Great sci-fi story\nPhenomenal voice-acting\nVariety of locales\nFull controller support\nCons  Bland textures in some areas\nUninspiring monsters\nNo replay value\nFinal Thoughts:\nIf you love horror but don't want that same old "Hide & Seek" formula like in say Alien: Isolation, Amnesia: The Dark Descent or Outlast then gove this game a try.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somguy9/recommended/282140/","somguy9","somguy9","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somguy9/","184 products in account","TL;DR : Yes, I recommend it. You should definitely buy it, and if you don't like horror games, just buy it for the story.\n\nSOMA isn't a horror game. You may or may not disagree with this, but at this point, a "horror game" on the Steam store is basically just a mess of jumpscares, woven together on a thread made by simple assets you can buy at any asset store. Sure, a few jump out as being good, even great, like the recently released 'Albino Lullaby', but in comparison, that amount is so small that it's basically nonexistent. SOMA is most DEFINITELY better than any of those wanky 'oh no it's a spooky girl that comes out and WOAH A JUMPSCARE!' kind of games, that basically have no point in them. SOMA is even deserving to be compared to Bioshock, and in my book, even remotely deserving to be compared to works such as those are a straight 7/10.\nSynopsis and such\nSOMA is a game where you play as Simon Jarett, your average canadian from Toronto, who sadly lost his girlfriend in a car crash and also had a brain concussion or something during that. Doctors in a medical facility have invited Simon to do an experimental brain scan, which may or may not help his condition. However, during the brain scan, you suddenly wake up in a desolate underwater facility, with seemingly no human contact whatsoever except for some weird robots thinking they are human. Your only hope is a woman you heard over the comms who tells you to come to 'Site Lambda', a different part of the facility you are in.\nA deeper look into the story\nWhat makes the game so special in comparison to all the other horror games on Steam (next to its massively built up hype, which was there for a good reason. I'll get to that in a sec), is that it isn't just a horror game. It doesn't rely on jumpscares or just pure gore, but it mostly relies on its philosophical ideas. Oh yes, there is a lot of philosophy in this game, of whether what you do is absolutely neccesary, and if whatever you do is right or wrong. If you liked Spec Ops: The Line for its story, you will most definitely like SOMA's story. In it I could even sometimes relate it to Neon Genesis Evangelion, with its themes for psychoanalysis and other deep stuff. All around, the story is incredibly deep and explores a lot of ideas that makes you think extremely deep about what you decide to do in the game. In many parts of it you, as Simon, retrace the steps of previous workers at the underwater facility Pathos-II, making it extremely similar in terms of style to the Amnesia series, where you kind of retrace in your own steps.\nHere is where we get into the gameplay bit.\nSOMA's gameplay is incredibly similar to the Amnesia series, with the puzzle solving, mostly involving your input into machinery or computers, and most of what you have to do is heard through audio recordings (which were notes in Amnesia: The Dark Descent), and also you getting chased around by monsters every so often, which isn't very surprising, as they are both made by the same developer (which is most of the part why it was so hyped up). However, in my perspective, the high frequency of a monster popping up kind of lowers the game's score in total, as it is basically like as if you are reading an amazing book, but an annoying child would interrupt you every so often, wanting to play hide & seek with you. Now, I'm not gonna lie, I was scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at quite a lot of points in the game. It's just that sometimes it works too much, and I honestly don't want to progress the story any further if I need to run past that one monster again. Next to that, the way the monster hiding sequences are handled are almost identical to other games made by Frictional: Run away if it sees you, throw objects to distract it etc. In my opinion, I think it would have been better if either the horror throttle was pitched a bit more down, or if a completely new horror technique was implemented. I loved this technique in the Amnesia series, but it hasn't aged very well. So yeah, the gameplay, although enjoyable at times and genuinely scary at others, is a bit repetitive.\nNow to the visual aspect\nThe game is visually appeasing. All the assets are well-made and detailed, making the entirety look like you are actually immersed into the story, being in a decrepit *SPOILERS* future *SPOILERS* underwater base, overrun by seaweed and corals and such, and really reminded me of the visual aspect of Bioshock 2 for some reason (probably involving the coral). The only bad thing about the visual aspect, is that some visual effects are nauseating. When you are either close or looking at one of the monsters, your screen goes all static, and when you get hit once, your screen goes all haywire and is unclear as ♥♥♥♥. Especially in the later areas of the game was I irritated by this. And although there is an extremely well thought-up narrative reason for this, it still doesn't make it less eyehurting.\nSounds n such\nThe soundtrack is great, and there can't really be said anything about it because, well, it's great and atmospheric, and I don't really see anything wrong with it. I guess it's pretty dynamic because it's pant-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly tense at some times, and tear-sheddingly beautiful at others (like that song in the end, bloody beautiful).\nAll in all, is SOMA a good game? Did it deserve the hype it got? Should I buy it?\nYes, yes, and heck yeah!","September 28, 2015","true","29.3"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

The story is incredibly well written, to the point that the Amnesia-esque monsters were just getting in the way. At every stage of the game, I was hooked into thinking "More story! Leave me alone monsters, let me get to more story!"\n\nHowever, because it is so well written, I don't want to spoil anything about it. What I will say is that if you're a fan of Christopher Nolan movies, one line that kept popping into my head as I played this game was from The Prestige, namely "No one cares about the man in the box." That is sort of the essence of this game, but to understand why, one just needs to play it.\n\nIf you are turned away from horror, I recommend reading guides. They will tell you when monsters are going to appear so you can be totally prepared for them.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/menthal/recommended/282140/","menthal","MenThal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/menthal/","161 products in account","I've been anxiously awaiting this release since I saw the matrix-esque teaser trailer that ended with "Am I… still here?" This is hard sci-fi done right. Deep philosophical themes criss-cross the game, touching several topics that sci-fi fans will recognise. It feels like a Philip K. DlCK story with a touch of Clive Barker horror.\n\nHorror survival and jump scares were never my thing. I played a bit on the old Penumbra series, but never got much out of the stories. Same with Amnesia; as there is only notes to unravel the story, very little character development can take place. The monster(s) often felt like primarily a nuisance., and puzzles convoluted.\n\nThis is not a problem with Soma; it does not rely on the notes and audio-logs to tell the story. The dialogue and interaction with other characters give the adventure thick and juicy meat to the tale. The monsters are not crawling everywhere, but play integral part of the story and flesh out the events. In fact, some of the monsters or "enemies" have dialogue. Puzzles have a wide range of types and difficulties, and they always fit with the story-line. Someone else noted that Soma is more "tense" than "scary", and I agree. This is a good thing, but rest assured, I still think my choice of white leather upholstery for my chair may have been a bad decision while playing Soma.\n\nThe choice of environment is a breath of fresh air - if you'll pardon the misplaced metaphor. The cramped underwater installations versus the "open" sea-bed give a nice contrast during gameplay, and gives a heightened feeling of realism, compared to similar games that take place in space. However, I don't think I'll be getting any new PADI certificates for quite a while after playing this game ...\n\nA ton of comparisons to other games, movies and books litter the forums, so I won't iterate those. However, one game with similar feel and atmosphere that I can also recommend is the indie game "The Fall".\nSome may compare it to "The Talos Principle", but Talos looks more like a cross between "Sophie's World" by Jostein Gaarder and a prequel to "I, Robot", when compared to Soma.\n\nA few minor criticisms: The game is very dark and blurry at times, and the usefulness of the flash light can be a bit hit and miss (out in the sea, it is as useful as high beams on a car in a blizzard). I also kept losing track of the tiny pointer; luckily it changes to something more obvious when you can interact with something, so waving the mouse around like you've got no muscles in the neck will help you find all that you need. Subtitles were also a big help, as some of the dialogue might not be as easy to hear. Being able to click once more on notes to get a plain-text of the blurry chicken scratches left by the people on the installation was a good idea, but I felt like I was missing some zooming possibility a few times.\n\nAll in all, this is a MUST HAVE game. A solid 9/10, also for you non-horror gamers. If you're thinking of watching the play-through videos; you won't get a tenth of the experience that you will playing on your own in the dark.\n\nOn a side note; I'm a Linux gamer and I was pleasantly surprised to see it work without any major hiccups on Linux.\n\nP.S.: This is one of the few games I think could be adapted into a good movie. Someone get Ridley Scott on the horn, ASAP!","September 26, 2015","true","15.5"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

I don't remember being impressed. "Great, it's a damn walking simulator," I thought to myself, with a sneer and a judgmental eye roll. "Well, Amnesia was great, and I've been following this stupid thing from that first trailer and loved the environment design they were going for, so screw it, some horror is better than no horror."\n\nLook, you didn't give me a choice, game. I need to progress through your damned story, I needed to do it to get to the next section, and besides, she was a robot anyway.\n\n"Oh great, start me off in a real life setting and then flip the switch, huh game?" I thought, mere minutes after clicking New Game. "Might as well just tell me it's all a fever dream, real insightful, namedrop that girl who died in the car crash every five minutes throughout the game, tell me about how it was all my fault, really cute.

At some point, your eyes will drift from the game to the edge of the screen, trace their way around a dimly lit room, and you will look back at the game... it doesn't have to ask the questions, the way a science fiction novel or movie would, never bold facedly proclaims "What's the difference between man and machine?" or "Is the world you live in truly real?"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bresdeko/recommended/282140/","Bresdeko","Desbreko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bresdeko/","133 products in account","SOMA is a thought prevoking and philisophical experience that stands out amongst traditional and cliche horror titles and stories, and begs it's players to stop and think of not only the ramifications of a future well within mankind's grasp, but about themselves entirely and what it is to truly be.\n\nSOMA is something that could only be delivered by Frictional Games. After Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs, I wasn't entirely sure what to expect from the studio, albeit I still had plenty of faith in them after playing not only the original Amnesia: the Dark Descent, but also the entire Penumbra series. I can gladly say that SOMA is everything i expected it to be, and I refrained from hearing any news on it online, and also watching any trailers so I would come in knowing nothing about the game and that it would be a fresh experience, and quite frankly, SOMA delivers something so chilling and thought provoking that the original Amnesias fell short of.\n\nVisuals\nVisually and asthetically, SOMA is beautifully dark and somber. While I found a few textures here and there that weren't exactly up to par with the textures elswhere in the game, it wasn't enough to detract from the beauty of the game entirely(It could've also just been my settings though). The look of the underwater facility you explore is entirely unique to me and the odd electronic cancer growing throughout the place is one in it's own. Keep in mind I'm trying my best not to spoil any details of the game. All in all, I found the game to look wonderfull, and even breathtaking at certain segments, having me stop to take in views and truly think about the environment and the situation this game had placed me in.\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay I think is brilliant, and at certain points has the sort of feel that A Machine for Pigs could evoke, only much stronger and enjoyable. Now, I'm not in any way saying this game is alot like AMFP, but the game definitely learns from the mistakes of The Chinese Room's previous installment in the Amnesia series. I was dissapointed with AMFP, just to get that out there now. SOMA is very much comparable to both The Dark Descent and the Penumbra series, at times seemlessly combining the asthetics and gameplay from both of those games and building onto it. I've heard a decent amount of complaining about the monsters and the tactics used in the game, but I much prefer it this way over the whole scripted feel of AMFP, as that game had encounters few and far between, and didn't instill the same type of horror encounters in SOMA and The Dark Descent do. The segments I found most satisfying were sifting through what was left of the underwater facility, and piecing together the mystery of what was left, where i was, and even  who  I was, more on that later though. I disagree with critics opinions on the whole monster bits and the mechanics used, and in each scenario I found myself horrified, and coward for quite a bit(My first playthrough took me 14 hours). While monsters typically are unique in each encounter and have their own exploits, you witness quite a few throughout the entire game, with some being repeated only a few times throughout. I enjoyed all of this thoroughly and think very highly of the way this game was executed.\n\nStory\nCombined with the gameplay, the story is what I think really sets this game apart from most other horror games. Unlike Outlast, a game in which you spent most of your time running from threat to threat with little to no breaks or relief in between, this game offers alot of time spent just rummaging around and so many of the objects in the environment are interactable, it really immerses you and gives you a sense of place. You can walk from room to room, inspecting the contents in each area and even piece together parts of the story just by looking through things and examining the setting thoroughly, and unlike in games such as Gone Home, and Dear Esther, this part of the game is engaging and very interesting to me. At certain segments I longed to hear the comfort of a companions voice while I sifted through rooms piecing together the puzzle that was the story, only to really be cowering behind objects straying from the horrifying monsters that lurk within the games corridors. Now don't get me wrong, I don't think this is a bad thing, in fact I think it's a very good thing. The game switches things up every now and then and the encounters really help you to appreciate the time you get to spend in peace in the game figuring things out for yourself, and in no way is this a bad thing, its exactly what sets this game apart from Gone Home, AMFP, and even Amnesia.\n\nConclusion\nSOMA is a surreal and extremely enticing experience and it really doesn't do it justice to just use the word story, as it's more than just a deep and philisophical story told through text or audio clips. Its something you experience, and in doing so provokes thoughts about mankind, our own selves and the consequences that specific decisions could have on not only others, but even oursleves and who we seem to think we may be. It begs the question;\nWhat is it that truly sets us apart from something we created, so long as it thinks and speaks the same way we do? When is the fine line between murder, and mercy crossed? What rights do we have as humans to infringe ourselves onto another being, whether that being is man  or  machine?","September 30, 2015","true","21.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs was more story-driven. Here is a wonderful balance of both, though the game overall feels more like the Penumbra games than Amnesia.\n\nGameplay is more-or-less the same as Amnesia, but that's not a problem. Why fix what ain't broke? Unique monsters for every area, I like that. Unique settings, spooky atmosphere, and intruiging features. The only issue is stuttering between areas, mostly due to the lack of loading screens so each area has to load in-game. As I understand, each area is loaded by progress/pressure chambers rather than proximity, so it has to load all at once causing stutters, which is understandable. The game has only been out for two days at the time of writing so that'll probably be worked on as time goes by.\n\nThe story is like something out of Star Trek. You know, those episodes that take the topic of "What does it mean to be human?" and explore it, picking apart philosophies that you probably haven't thought much of. SOMA does that. What is humaity? Who are we? What do we feel? Do robots feel as we do? If we lose our bodies and all that's left are our conscious minds, are we still what we are? Some lines made me pause the game to mull over what was said.\n\nThe last ten minutes of the game were some of the most emotionally-conflicting experiences I've ever had in a video game and I feel very torn over the ending. Rarely games affect me in the way SOMA did. Get it. It's worth it.","September 24, 2015","true","10.5"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

Its plot is also good per se and contains interesting reflections on human identity and its persistence, something that might give decent food for thought to philosophically inclined players. The PATHOS-II facility is a creepy place thanks to its level design and the superb sound effects, there's a great sense of abandonement and estrangement as you explore its rooms and slowly uncover what happened there. Just like in previous games from the same dev you can expect to encounter some truly disturbing imagery both in actual scenes and in the reports scattered around the station.\n\nThe writing and dialogues can become a bit too heavy handed at times, as if Frictional was afraid their you'd miss certain meta concepts if they aren't obviously and clunkily thrown on your face every now and then. It can get midly annoying but thankfully the overall plot and its themes are good and interesting enough to make those moments easily forgivable. Monster encounters are generally decent affairs, I personally feel they're not really "scary" but can certainly be very tense when you're playing cat and mouse with a baddie in dimly light hallways: each enemy type has different strengths and weaknesses and it's generally up to you to discover what they are through trial and error. This can become slightly annoying if you can't make sense of an enemy's reaction and are forced to face it amongst small corridors with little space to hide or run. Honestly, my advice is to simply look up a guide if you feel an enemy has become an unnecessary obstacle.\n\nI certainly recommend SOMA to any fan of the psychological horror genre, even more so if you're a fan of Frictional's previous games, its shortcomings are easily forgiven once you're taken by the plot and it's a journey worth taking.","April 17","true","9.5"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rust_decay/recommended/282140/","rust_decay","raZe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rust_decay/","394 products in account","Hypothetical situation: You’re playing a videogame and in it, you’re walking through dimly lit, narrow hallways looking for the exit. Occasionally you stumble over a mangled corpse, listen to audio tapes and avoid disfigured creatures because you can’t fight back. Which videogame am I talking about? Answer: It doesn’t matter.\n\nThere’s a point when certain clichés used without a hint of irony become annoying and Soma marks that point. It plays like a checklist of every popular element featured in a horror game in the last eight years. Dark corridors? Check. Player vulnerability? Check. Puzzles? Check. Audio logs containing either exposition, terror or directions? Check. Side character that blabbers in your ear? Check. Being forced to take detours over Mordor? Check. It wouldn’t be that much of a problem if the game offered somehing more substantial beyond that, or at least something interesting for the player to do.\n\nSoma is the fifth game developed by Frictional Games and it marks a shift from cosmic horror to science fiction horror. An underwater research facility serves as the backdrop for this horror adventure, but it’s not just monsters who are out to get you. Psychological elements were thrown in as well since the plot deals with existential themes like identity, self, reality, death, humanity and how technology influences our perception of those. While not badly executed, Frictional is so in love with their sci-fi concepts that they drastically overestimate their novelty. Unless you have willingly ignored all the works of science fiction conceived in the last fifty years, nothing Soma throws at you will come as a surprise. Again, which wouldn’t be a problem if the game had more to show you.\n\nIt’s noteworthy that traditional game elements take a backseat in favor of conventional storytelling. While Penumbra and Amnesia featured item management as part of their survival approach, Soma doesn’t even have an inventory. Instead, the game goes great lengths to dump more exposition on you via audio recordings or diary entries, which are always conveniently placed thanks to the mindful souls who create them even if the monsters are already feeding on their entrails. Sometimes Soma remembers it’s supposed to be a game and lets you perform a menial task, for which you will be rewarded with more exposition like the good boy you are. While none of the puzzles in Amnesia or Penumbra were too challenging, at least they made you stop and think for a moment. Despite the occasional underwater sections, Soma feels like an on-rails experience where you’re shoved from one exposition dump to the next.\n\nTo top it off, Soma commits the cardinal sin for any horror game: It’s simply not scary. One reason for this is the lack of player involvement. In Amnesia, you had to be mindful with your items. Failing to manage your resources properly resulted in a game over. To increase your chances of survival, you could explore Brennenburg Castle, but you risked running into more creatures. Amnesia was scary because the fear of failure amplified the fear of the game’s creatures and failure was always a result of the player’s longterm decisions. In Soma, it’s more like you’re just tagging along for the ride since there are long sections where it’s clear you are out of danger and you are not making any longterm decision at all.\n\nAmnesia is genius because it does what all great works of horror fiction do: It lets your imagination do all the work. Before any threat is introduced, just through environments and lighting alone Amnesia makes it clear that you’re playing a horror game. You’re constantly expecting something in the shadows, afraid it might jump you in every new room you step into, but it never happens. When you’re almost getting bored, Amnesia drops the hammer. And even then, it tries to keep the threat as vague as possible for your imagination to fill in the blanks, because uncertainty is scary and nothing is scarier than what your own mind can come up with. To achieve that, Amnesia puts you through a chain of vulnerabilities: You can stock up on items, but you run danger of encountering another creature. You can eliminate your fear of what might be hiding in the darkness by lighting a lamp, but doing that too often will blow through your resources in no time and make them unavailable for when you might actually need them. And you might attract a monster. You can get rid of uncertainty by looking at the monsters, but you risk a game over since direct exposure to the supernatural horrors affects the main character’s sanity. So does hiding in the shadows since he is supposed to be nyctophobic. To cut a long story short: Every fear Amnesia tingles is backed up by a game mechanic. Soma features nothing along those lines. It takes you on a sightseeing tour and expects you to be scared just because it made the lights flicker a bit. The monster encounters are more tedious than scary and every bit of tension is destroyed because the game gives you enough opportunity to observe how sluggish and dumb they are.\n\nSpeaking of monster encounters: You better pray that the creatures kill you if they ever spot you. Soma has no health meter, so any damage you take is represented visually by gradually enhancing the amount of chromatic aberration in the picture. While the effort of having as little HUD as possible is appreciated, the effect is so excessive that it will make your eyes bleed. It is also applied whenever you relive someone else’s memories. Unless you’re really careful, your screen will be a blurry mess for a good chunk of the game.\n\nEven the atmosphere isn’t as tight as it could be. Being stuck at the bottom of the ocean practically screams for evoking a sense of loneliness and desolation, but it’s ultimately ruined by the characters’ chattiness.\n\nSoma does have its moments, though. Like a trip to the deep sea where all kinds of horrors might be lurking. But it takes way too long to get to those segments and they don’t compensate nearly enough for the whole lot of nothing that occurs beforehand. For the majority of its length, Soma remains a dull affair. As if there’s a much shorter game in here that has been stretched way too thin.\n\nFrictional Games seem to have taken too many cues from The Chinese Room. If there’s a lesson to be learned here, it’s that your game better backs up what it’s aiming for through the game’s mechanics. And that telling a story by letting the player sift through audio logs and notes has been officially done to death. It’s time to take the old boy to the backyard and put him down.","October 14, 2015","false","9.8"," 282 of 527 people (54%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","54","282","527","15","49"

As you start to explore, and try to understand what is happening, it quickly becomes apparent that something has gone badly wrong. The facility is offline, and has been overrun by some kind of robots that are trying to kill you.\n\nSoma is the latest game from Frictional Games, the developer of Amnesia: The Dark Descent, which is probably the scariest game I've ever played. I wouldn't really describe Soma as a horror game though. The first hour was quite unsettling, dark environment, loud banging, strange noises, the fear of the unknown. But after I'd encountered the first couple of enemies I actually relaxed a lot.\n\nYou don't have any weapons, so you can't fight back or defend yourself. You need to avoid or sneak past enemies, and if they notice you, all you can do is run away and hide. But this isn't too difficult, because the AI isn't particularly smart, and most enemies stick to a specific patrol route. And even if you do get attacked, its not an instant death, but instead you lose some health and are knocked unconscious, and then they leave you alone. It takes 2-3 hits to kill you, and there are some places where you can heal. Its more like a basic stealth game.\n\nThe best part of Soma is the story, which has an intriguing sense of mystery as you slowly discover what happened both inside and outside the facility. It does a good job of exploring interesting concepts like what does it mean to be Human, and what does it mean to be alive. Voice acting is pretty good. However I was disappointed that  along the way you get to make a couple of choices that seem really important at the time, but they don't actually affect the ending in any way.\n\nSoma isn't great from a technical point of view. Even though my PC is significantly above the recommended specs and I had a constant 60 FPS, I suffered from a frequent 1-2 second stutter when looking around. I found lots of similar complaints on the forum but no clear solution.\n\nI think Soma is worth playing if you like a good story, but if you're more interested in gameplay mechanics you might be disappointed. Either way, at 9 hours long, its not worth a full price purchase, so wait for a sale. I bought it at 40% off which feels like a fair price.","May 8","true","9.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

They are the developers responsible for creating Amnesia: The Dark Descent and the Penumbra series. I don’t typically play games that are in the Horror genre, and this is the first game I’ve played by this particular developer. Now sci-fi games, that’s completely different. I can deal with a little bit of horror in that case. At first, I thought I was stepping into a space station. It was a very metallic environment, I felt encased, protected from the outside world, which I thought had to be space. I eventually got to a point where I was presented with the fact that I was going to drown. I was confused, wondering where all of this water was coming from. Turns out, I wasn’t in space after all. I was under the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe atmosphere of SOMA is insane. I began to question everything. Am I real? Is this happening? Am I dreaming? Who is human? Who is not? Am I human, or am I robot? Early on in the game, I also wondered if I was the sole survivor or if there were others. Everything was so confusing. What I knew of the world just made everything feel upside down, and even as I began to gather more information I just felt further confused, and everything became even more complicated. It was like the more that was revealed, the more questions I had. Then, to top that off, you have the sounds of the environment and the fear that you are being hunted.

Turns out this is by far Frictional’s best game! The visual design, writing, and puzzles are nearly perfect and, while it’s less scary than Amnesia, that allows it to be much better paced. The plot’s themes are sometimes so cliché they’re boring, but it also takes you in some unexpected and mature directions.\n\nThe audio is the best I’ve heard in any game since Dead Space. There’s amazing attention to detail in the sound of very physics object, animating door, and creature. The chromatic aberration effect is overused, but does a great job of alerting you to danger.

If you like SCI-FI genre in movies and games both, and you can handle pressure as in Amnesia with pretty much same mechanics here and there..you are good ! :ss13ok:\n\nPersonally I would rate this game 8.5/10 based on my experiance as a person who dont like horror games but still HUGE fan of SCI-FI genre.\n\nAtmosphere 9\nGraphics 8\nAudio 8\nStory 9\nLevel design 9\n\nREVIEW (done on my website aswel)\n\nAnother title from Frictional Games, the creators of Amnesia: The Dark Descent wildly appear after 2 years since first announcement to fulfill spot in sci-fi horror genre, SOMA.\n\nGuy, brain damage, experiment, empty underwater facility, robots and creatures. Shortly definition of SOMA without spoiling too much. You are taking role of Simon, guy who had accident and now is trying through experimental way with Dr.Mushi to fix problems although things go horrible wrong once when you need luck most. Simon wakes up in dark and empty facility where he needs to survive and figure out whats happening and where is he located.\n\nAs Frictional Games predecessor you will find yourself in dark corners often trying to escape and avoid creatures, this time without sanity system which I’m not sure that is great idea. In fact once when you are in danger, screen glitches and distorts which contribute to immersion in begining but not so much for overall feeling and impression afterwards. This time you will be able to return something to them and potentialy neutralize them which makes situations a bit more challenging and interesting. New method of dying system which Frictional Games used for first time is one extra life, where after being spotted and “killed” you get second chance on same exact location but with bloody and blury screen; where you can either die and return to last checkpoint or find way to refill your health.\n\nGame is made in first person and once again you get chance to interact with world in same mechanics as in Amnesia. Click on a door to grab it, then push with the mouse to shove it open. Everything you touch, push or pick feels heavy and tangible. There are obviosly no weapons and despite already well known approach of hidding and running this feels for some reason a bit more complex then what actually it is.\n\nEssentially all comes to hidding and making progress from one destination but not always alone. Most impressive aspect of the game is probably PATHOS-II facility itself. As we mentioned its located underwater, at the bottom of the ocean, it’s like Rapture meets the Nostromo. Most of the time dark, claustrophobic full with metal corridors created of hard sci-fi set design which suits to atmosphere absolutely perfectly along with flickering lights and weird black alien goo seeping through cracks in the ceilings. You are supposed to investigate and go through couple different small facilities and eventually get to desired destination.\n\nMajor difference with SOMA comparing to previus horror titles is that creatures are scary at first while once when you figure out what is happening and who is after you, it all come to hide and seek, but this time you have feeling that you are doing that with guards in completely other genre. Sure horror aspects are still here with everything above described but tension is going down as further as you progress and you will probably get more frustrated then scared as loong as you are stucked in one section. It feels like that SOMA deliver much more to sci-fi genre while horror aspects are here just to make things better. You will encounter couple different AI with different mechanics, while once you will try to be quite, next time you will need to avoid looking at your enemy and hope that he isnt going to appear behind your back. Some are faster, some not, sometimes you will need to get your strength and go for a run; all depends on your choice !\n\nOnce in a while you will get opportunity to make step outside of facility where you can explore and enjoy in underwater world. It feels like that area is huge but it’s hard to lose yourself neither its possible to leave facility surrounding but you really dont have that feeling which is result of great level design. As inside you will encounter some puzzles and levels where exploring is important but also where you can leave behind some important and crucial info for overall story. This time there are no long notes which are narrated by character voices or you need to read them, in fact you get couple ways of collecting informations about story and characters around through audio recordings and couple more not so “natural” ways which I shouldnt explore if I want to avoid spoilers.\n\nThere is another aspect which is expected to be seen in this kind of game. Puzzles. Personally I didnt encounter any frustrating puzzle while many complaints about same. They are not simple puzzles which you can solve in one room neither really fast but with logic and little bit of thinking you will find a solution which will usually require a bit of backtracking but nothing near that what we experianced in Amnesia. Despite having more distanced parts of facility you arent going to worry about backtracking on scary places or privious levels..well no if you already didnt go there for no reason which will most likely happen.\n\nSOMA is refreshing title, almost masterpiece of atmosphere and sci-fi elements with little bit of horror elemets but still enough to make these two genres perfectly combined.\n\nOriginal link - http://www.dsr07gaming.com/soma-review/","September 22, 2015","true","10.5"," 37 of 65 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","37","65","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ZynzynzyN/recommended/282140/","ZynzynzyN","MetaCitizen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ZynzynzyN/","147 products in account","SOMA captures a harrowing shade of existential dread in a way that only a smaller development team could accomplish. Similar in tone to the films Moon and "9" with many obligatory nods to Alien, It actually plays very similarly to Alien: Isolation. Even spookier than Bioshock seafloor vibes with amazing writing, believable dialog, clever  pacing that is always taking surprising turns, and very nice voice acting. It deals with many questions of both human identity and machine consciousness in a way that is very sophisticated, well informed and not at all watered down. There also seems to be a theme here of being forced to adjust your expectations in order to deal with the overwhelming harshness of reality. Its super fun and rewarding to explore the beautifully designed maps and learn more about the various habitats and their past. When it comes to the horror aspects of the game, although I am rarely truly disturbed by games or fictional films, there was at least one moment where my hands were shaking too badly to continue playing. I'm pretty sure this exaggerated reaction resulted from the attention paid to the games sound engine that ramps up the tension as sharply as possible when a monster approaches, speaking of which SOMA HAS THE BEST SOUND DESIGN!  I would go so far as to say that this game is a borderline masterpiece, and would be complementary to a fine cut of steak, seafood, pasta or Alien: Isolation.\n\nFinal verdict: 9.5 out of 11","September 30, 2015","true","17.0"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","2"

I cannot write much about this game without spoling it so I will just give the basics. I am sure that this game will be talked about by philosophers within the next few years.\n\n-The game nails the concept that being nonexistent is not scary or necessarily bad because you don't know you are dead;\n\n-The game makes you reflect what the value of existence can be reduced to zilch as long as it could be swithced on an off with ease and that you don't experience time when you are not concious;\n\n-The game demonstrates that your sentience is just as valuable and as real as other people's sentience and that the universe will keep doing its thing whether you are there to observe it or not;\n\n-The game makes a point that there are only two safe states where sentience is safe from harm:  being nonexistent and living in a virtual world free from harm.\n\n\nOne negative thing:\n\n-the main protagonist's voice acting is mostly flat. 90% of the time it seems that he is simply reading a script and not really putting any emotion behind his soliloquies and dialogue.\n\nOverall, I cannot recommend this game enough; it is quite long - it took me 9 hours to beat it. If you like philosophy and have an ounce of interest about what life is all about then by all means play this game.\n\nPersonally, this is my favorite game of the year after TW3.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PsychoticRabbit/recommended/282140/","PsychoticRabbit","PsychoticRabbit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PsychoticRabbit/","371 products in account","In my opinion, the best way to play Soma is to immerse yourself in its world completely. Explore, dig through the backstory, and reflect on the questions it poses. Let it take you emotionally and guide you through its dark corridors and wide, beautiful, eerie expanses. If at all possible, play it knowing as little as possible going in, and keep an open mind. It is a highly narrative focused game, and it does its job wonderfully, providing a great story revolving around one of the most intriguing philosophical questions out there: what does it mean to be human?\n\nIt's important to know that Soma is NOT an Amnesia clone. It is more of a sci-fi adventure game than a full blown horror title, alternating between calm moments of dialogue or exploration and sequences of intensity. Pacing is one of the many things this game does very well. While there are monsters, their inclusion should not be a selling point. At times they seemed like narrative tools or were simply more frustrating than scary due to their AI. However, they did make sense for the story, and they aren't a big enough part of the game to detract from it significantly, either.\n\nThe world Frictional Games has created here has a striking attention to detail in level and sound design, as well as their fleshing out of the story through audio logs and documents. I found myself searching all over levels trying to make sure I didn't miss any detail because of how interesting the story was. It is also worth noting that the soundtrack aids where it is included, but is not overbearing, remaining absent for the moments where it would be inappropriate. I was also glad to see the voice acting, while brought down slightly by inconsistent characterization of the protagonist, was believable and likeable, aided by fantastic writing.\n\nIn Soma, the story leads to very dark places, but the game handles these with tact. It gives proper solemnity to the weight of the issues it portrays and the questions that arise. The characters are believable and I liked the vast majority of them. As I mentioned beforehand, the writing is top notch, and adds dimension to the already visceral world. It is important to note that the story is the main focus, though, so the puzzles are rather basic, but they fit in the world for the most part, though there are some small instances where they seem like distractions to coax a greater sense of immersion, which can backfire. Overall, though, the story is one of my favorites in all of gaming, despite some plotholes and an illusion of choice that sometimes arises for the player's benefit but have no bearing on the story, from what I can tell.\n\nI did run into some issues while playing. Screen tearing happened quite often, even with V-Sync enabled and the game sometimes had mediocre to poor performance despite being on the recommended settings, specifically freezing, presumably caused by loading. There was even a section where I repeatedly crashed, though that, and most of the other issues, were remedied by updating my card's drivers.\n\nSoma satisfied my high expectations, though it won't be enjoyed by everyone. For those with a love of science fiction, adventure games, atmospheric horror that goes beyond jumpscares, and bleak stories with moral ambiguity, I'm confident it will be a blast.","October 3, 2015","true","10.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

All I knew going in was that SOMA was developed by the guys behind Amnesia and Penumbra, and that it as set underwater. I was therefore caught off guard when confronted with existential questions and the idea of surpassing our mortality. These are the things that truly frighten me, not some monster I need to circumvent in a maze of corridors, or the crushing depth of the ocean.\n\nEverything is elevated by the fantastic voice cast in the game, especially the people who voiced Simon and Catherine, both of whom gave incredibly genuine, human performances, and made all the important scenes all that more emotional.\n\nSOMA isn't perfect, and it probably won't scare you if you're looking for the next big horror game, but if you want something that'll leave you dazed after completion, then this is the game for you.\n\n\nPretty good.","September 24, 2015","true","12.5"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","4"

Sue me, I was on my weekend on a weekday and I work nights.  What better way to spend it then a brand new horror game by Frictional?\n\nIf you're looking for a spiritual sequel to Amnesia, this is only halfway there.  SOMA is far more story driven, with a voiced protaganist this time.  The setting is also a complete 180.  It's very futuristic, and brings up a lot of philosophical questions about the soul.  Throw in a splash of Bioshock (haha puns) and this is what you get.\n\nThe gameplay is essentially the same as the Penumbra and Amensia series.  Part "Walking Simulator" and part "hide from the scary monsters".  You go around interracting with things, picking up items, hiding from psuedo-zombies that screw up your vision, and keep progressing.  An interesting addition is a 3 strikes system with the enemies.  If you meet one face to face you essentially black out and wake up in the same spot you were attacked, with the enemy that found you some ways off, allowing you to hide again.  Each time you're attacked your vision gets a little more blurry and your movement lopsided, but you're still able to continue.\n\nThe story is absolutly delicious, but it's hard to tell too much about it with giving major spoilers.  Essentially, you're a Canadian you got into a nasty car accident, has pretty bad brain damage, and decides to go through some experimental treatment.  Within the blink of an eye, you're suddenly in another world with no idea of what's going on.\n\nAll in all, a solid game from Frictional, and I look forward to see what they come up with next.","September 22, 2015","true","8.2"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","0"

It's not as "crap-your-pants" scary as games like Amnesia and Outlast, but the story is more disturbing in it's realism. And honestly, the story is the real star of the show here, because the "stealth" sections are pretty standard for this type of game. There's no real ghosts or any kind of out-of-this world monsters running around. Well, maybe there's a little bit of that, but...well, I don't want to put any spoilers in, actually. The characters are surprisingly well portrayed and garner quite a bit of sympathy, which - knowing what you know when you get about two hours into the game - was quite a feat by Frictional.\n\nNeedless to say, the concepts will get you thinking in a way that few other games can even begin to approach.\n\nI mean, I'm a friggin sloth, and it even got ME wondering about the state of my consciousness.

I did play Amnesia: The Dark Descent however this was a different kind of horror than TDD offered. SOMA made me think about the consequences of my actions as well as questions of identity. The philosophy of the game reminded me a lot of Decartes as well as Sarte's arguments for the mind and existence.\n\nSo all in all if you like critical thinking in a horror environment this is your game.

Think about it as an interactive piece of dystopian sci-fi horror. While the game is fairly linear, this helps provide a more smooth, connected story experience. There are many choices to be made during the game, but not in terms of map path: The choices you must make are emotional ones.\n\nOverall, the gameplay is enjoyable. There are few portions of the game where I became disconnected from the story. It feels intensely frustrating and disempowering to be unable to fight the enemies in the game, but it provides for a more compelling experience. The enemy AI is mostly fine, although there was one instance where I was trapped by an enemy in an alerted state in a room with one exit, and it never came out of its alerted state or left the room, forcing me to die and start from the last (thankfully close) checkpoint.\n\nThe controls feel natural if you're used to FPS games, they did not get in the way and served to help with immersion as the movements needed to interact with various objects feels natural.\n\nNoticeably, the music and sound of the game was rather nice and added to the feel of the game without being overly cheesy or intrusive.\n\nThe horror aspect of the game was good. A few times, the horrifying portions of the game feel repetetive, but at least they're not tropey. Overall, there were only a few times where I rolled my eyes when I should have been feeling an adrenaline rush.\n\nI would recommend this game, especially if you're a fan of philosophy and horror.","December 26, 2015","true","16.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

The sound effects, although a little repetitive, are good and create a lot of suspense and add to an atmosphere that you would expect within a horror game. It has fairly good gameplay although a little too linear in my opinion. The graphics are ok but no wear near what I believe they should be for a game in this day and age.\n\nI have seen some of the reviews saying that this is the best horror since sliced bread. No. No it isn't. This is a really good game worth buying, but if you compare this game to Alien Isolation or Outlast I just don't think it comes close. I personally think that Alien Isolation had the best atmosphere ever created in a game as well as sound effects, it was much scarier, the AI was better and still one of the best out there, it looked a million times better graphically and was just overall worth the price you paid (whatever you paid). I will always be bias towards it as it was my GOTY 2014.\n\nThis isn't a review about Alien: Isolation though. It's a review about Soma. I think this is worth a buy and I would describe this as a game which has a Stanley Parable kind of visual, similar in some ways to Alien Isolation in terms of gameplay and effects and kind of reminds you a bit of Bioshock 1 and 2 with it's underwater gameplay and world. It has nothing comparable to any of the Amnesia games so if that is what you are looking for, it's not here. Is it worth the asking price? Possibly. You will get around 9 - 15 hours out of it depending on how much time you choose to spend taking in all of the scenery and different rooms. On a straight through run through you could probably complete this game in under 10 hours at a guess. I am 3/4 of the way done and 12 hours in now with a lot of exploring!\n\nGet it, play it for a couple of hours and if you don't like it, well that's what Steam refund is for.

This game was amazing, wouldn't have expected nothing less from Frictional since this game was under development for five years! They basically started to work on this almost right after Amnesia The Dark Descent was released. Good work, Frictional!\n\nThe story was... really great and many times, especially towards the end I got this unsettling feeling inside, really making me think how to actually define the human being. The game really sucks you in and with the horror elements it's easily one of my favourite games. I spent 12 hours on the main story and since we have mod support (Amnesia's Custom stories), we can expect some great user content to really extend the play time one can get from this game!\n\nThe graphics aren't AAA-level, but after all Frictional Games isn't a huge studio, but everything was still a pleasure to look at. The graphical effects were also really cool and makes this game unique graphics-wise.\n\nI absolutely loved Amnesia: TDD's Finnish-made soundtrack and effects. Gladly Frictional Games still uses Tapio Liukkonen's sound effect services and Mikko Tarmia's eerie soundtrack. The game is amazing for your ears too, helping to find the right atmosphere for the current situation.\n\nThe gameplay is quite similar to Frictional's previous games. We've got a great physics engine and really, one thing I missed in A Machine For Pigs (Shame on you thechineseroom) was the interactibility. I spent the first 10 minutes of the game throwing stuff around in Simon's apartment. Oh, it feels great!\nThe monsters in this game are unique. All of them move and react differently, making you wonder how to get past this one. Once you get the gist of one, it isn't hard to overcome the situation, but damn it's still scary since you can't know if it reacts in other ways too.\n\nFull 10 out of 10. One of my favourite games.\n\nOne thing I'm still wondering though.

As a lover of the Pnumbra series, I had to buy this game, the amount of thought put into this was incredible and the audio and visuals were spot on. I would never buy a game for $30 with the way that the path games are taking now a days, ever. I put a lot of faith into this company spending this money and I am way more happy with it than ever imagined. Amazing story. Amazing graphics. Ambience. Spooky as hell. Thought provoking.\n\nThe feeling of being human comes alive with the story and I cannot recommend it enough. All the characters are people you get attached too, in one way or the other. You may hate someone but isn't that the way to show the connection between you and another? If you have real feelings of hate or love or anything? They pull this off perfectly.\n\nPnumbra had a little of this, with Red. Especially with Clarance, little b****. In this game though they really drove the point. It was an amazing story and the next game they release is a 100% chance I'll buy it.\n\nIf you like horror, you'll enjoy this. If you think it'll be too hard or too easy, don't. Many aspects are very challenging but through careful observation you'll make it. I would never say it's too easy. I believe it is a perfect combonation. Also you can save at any point, so if you want to leave and take a break, you aren't waiting for that save spot. I have heard some instance of it being framy but I have not experienced it past the autosaves 2 second frame lag.\n\nSo in conclusion, I say buy this game, turn up the volume to dangerous levels, and immerse yourself into this amazing game.","September 30, 2015","true","12.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

All this happens in the first 15 minutes, after which you spend the next few hours figuring out just what's going on, and dealing with the situation. SOMA uses Frictional's proprietary engine to really give a sense of tactility to your actions. You don't open cabinets, you swing the door outwards. It all helps to place you in the world, and it's an amazingly well realised place. Claustrophic, extremely atmospheric, and menacing, all the more so until you find out what's going on, and then it becomes even more frightening with the realisation of your situation.\n\nThe storyline here is one of the most compelling that I've played in a long time. It's well-written, smart, and the voice actors do an excellent job with great material. SOMA also has monsters, frightening enough to make you think twice about opening a door when you don't know what's behind it, and you will end up cowering in a dark corner on many occasions. Each monster behaves differently, and reacts to you in different ways. The first creature you encounter allows you to take a good look at it before it tries to kill you, the later creatures are much more horrific for what they were, what they are, and how they react to you. Some say that the monsters detract from the game, but I found the opposite; they're an integral part of the story, and it allows welcome changes of pace between pure terror and relief, something which Amnesia did so well.\n\nBut the monsters are secondary to the experience and the story, with some fascinating set pieces. It's difficult to talk about them without giving too much away, but they are never short of thought-provoking, and at times heart-wrenching. The whole game is several cuts above your typical videogame storyline, and the ending is both haunting and satisfying at the same time.\n\nWithout doubt one of my favourite games of 2015.","December 7, 2015","true","15.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Forget about the "horror" tags, this is a well-written dystopian narrative in a sci-fi future with environmental puzzles.  Think Bioshock meets Myst.  If anything, the occasional monster sequences actually take away from the game.  If I had to play it again, I would probably use the "Wuss Mode" mod that makes the AI non-agressive.  The real achievement here is the beautifully rendered decayed industrial 3D environments and the atmosphere that the game builds.  There are also some very interesting philosophical issues explored in the story, great sound & voice work, and it's long enough to satisfy.

There were a few times I was just frustrated and for some reason I always refused to watch a YouTube video to get past a part, etc. not being able to distract monsters by throwing things is also a really big like, "well why have it then?" Kind of thing. It's useful a few times but still.\n\nThat out of the way, this game was awesome! Most atmospheric and interesting game I've played maybe ever. The water sequences were my favorite as well as the pacing. For being a horror game, they like also give you a break from time to time. It goes from being absolutely horrifying to relaxing, which makes both parts (the puzzles and the horror) that much more enjoyable and good. I would have preferred more puzzles than horror but whatever it was still good.\n\nLast thing is it's the only game I've played in a while that like I tend to think about from time to time... Partly because of that time I almost fell out of my chair or screamed like a little girl but also just like appreciating the story and although to me it was a predictable story, it was just freaking creepy, mind blowing and clean. Clean meaning it all made sense and felt consistent. For being so ridicoulous and unbelievable, it actually seemed very believable.\n\nPlay it soon before the graphics get too outdated (cause they aren't just outstanding currently either).","May 28","true","14.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

If you are worried about the monsters ruining the experience for you, I can tell you that I did not get killed once my entire playthrough. 95% of the monsters allow you to get hit once or twice before they kill you, and whenever they hit you, it just knocks you out and the monsters wander off.\n\nTldr: Great game if you even remotely enjoy discovery and/or story-centric games.","May 24","true","16.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

SOMA is not genre-defying innovation: monster mechanics will be reminiscent to anyone familiar with Frictional's previous titles, and wandering about an abandoned place finding clues is ubiquitious to the genre (though I love it!).  It is, however, a masterful execution of all of those horror/scifi game notes, clearly learned from practiced iteration through their previous titles -- the wonderful writing and all its great dreary, existential themes are combined with Frictional's eye for suspense and storytelling -- it's excellent and truly captivating.","October 28, 2015","true","33.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Most people had high expectations because of Amnesia, but I was hyped because of the combination of survival horror and scifi. There's not enough games like that these days.\n\nBefore I actually got to play the game, I read other reviews and comments, stating that the game wasn't scary, was repititive and didn't live up to Amnesia. That didn't bother me, as I just wanted a great atmosphere and story. And boy, did I get that! Personally the game had the right amount of scares and "discomfort" - way better atmosphere than in 'Amnesia'. A lot of people don't like the grunts or monsters in 'SOMA', but compared to 'Amnesia', they scared the hell out of me - usually because I actually knew who they were, their story and what the wanted, unlike 'Amnesia'. The best word to describe SOMA would be "disturbing", rather than scary.\n\nI don't really want to compare 'SOMA' to Amnesia, because they are two very different games. I would rather compare 'SOMA' to 'Penumbra'. I would call 'SOMA' a mix of 'Alien: Isolation' and 'Penumbra', with a mix of themes from 'System Shock' and 'I Have No Mouth But I Must Scream'. And even 'The Swapper' actually.\n\nThe game isn't perfect. I felt like the developers had trouble deciding what they wanted to use and what to discard. You feel like they're certain areas, that was supposed to have been used for something bigger, but was eventually discarded. The same goes for certain characters and scenarios, which you'll think have a much huger impact later on or will return, but don't. The supersecret.rar file in the folder confirms this. Secondarily, I lacked a mechanism, other than wandering around, picking stuff up and handling computers. Maybe something similar to the tinderboxes and lightning up candles in 'Amnesia' - a reason to open every drawer, other than just finding tidbits of inormation, that's not necessary for completing the story.\n\n-- SPOILERS --\n\nThe story is great and along with the great and disturbing atmosphere, it's what makes the game great. I would have liked more information on the various people on Pathos-II, like more on Ross, Akers, Sarang, Herber etc. But the ethical, moral and philosophic questions that the game raise, are great. It's just a shame that none of these make any impact on the ending, because I've never felt so at loss when deciding what to do. Usually there's a good and evil choice in games, but not in SOMA. And that's so awesome! And great use of sound effects as well. I haven't heard sounds that great since I played Dead Space in 2008.\n\n-- SPOILER END --\n\nI'm very much looking forward to see what kind of mods will be made for this game. Imo they don't have to be scary. But Frictional Games did a great job on this game and to be honest, I will consider this game their best so far.\n\n9,5 / 10","September 27, 2015","true","12.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

WHO DOESN'T want a smooth release nowadays?\n\nI've had no issues with optimization or bugs in this game, and it was one of the rare smooth launches so far, along the side of Metal Gear Solid V and Mad Max. I do not know why there are some people complaining. Fix your computers maybe?\n\nWith that said, the game is... well... hauntingly scary and amazing in several ways. It's very clever in its own ways, but I cannot say much without spoling it. The game immerses you in such a way that you just want to know what will happen. It leaves you question your own self, and the concept of survival and humanity play in.\n\nFrictional Games outdid themselves with their engine and sound effects. I literally looked behind myself a few times, thinking there was things actually going on in my room than the game. The sound is just so crisp and authentic, along the balance of decent looking graphics. They're not the best, but the graphics work. In terms of gameplay, this has plenty of things to do that will keep you on the edge of insanity. Even though this game doesn't have the same sanity system as the previous Amnesia: The Dark Descent did, the horror itself and the... "things" are very nicely done, each with a unique way of having to get around them.\n\nI believe this is worth the money, and your time, should you be looking for a rich story and a hauntingly amazing atmosphere.","September 23, 2015","true","10.1"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","2"

It is very smart and very depressing game (unlike Amnesia TDD or Penumbra). Casual horror fans might find it a bit lacking in bombastic scares, but it's the story that will keep your mind racing for weeks after you finished it. I just collected my thoughts to recommend this game here. As I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone with IQ high enough to keep the discussion with it, but it's hard to explain why. Yeap, this game is an open discussion, dialog with the player, developers talk to you through gameplay and story. Talk about things you weren't up to talking about. The game is not scaring you, it forces you to scare you by your own thoughts. It's that type of horror that make you double-check what you think is right, to reevaluate your beliefs. And just like in real life you'll always be wrong and sooner or later you'll regret your decisions.\nLong story short: this game is philosophical and ethical discussion in a vein of The Talos Principle. But instead of puzzles you get monsters. What makes us human? What death really means? Is there death at all?\n\nI'm pretty sure if you are that type of person you'll ignore some of the game's flaws. Be it sometimes bad dialogs or scares just for the sake of scares. The game has very immersive atmosphere, great sound and visual design. Also has great sense of going deeper and deeper down the ocean. You might loose an arm in the process. I recommend this game to everyone with open mind, not only horror fans.\n\np.s.: the ending will leave a scar.

I just finished this game and I'm in awe. So sorry if this review is a bit scrambled, it's because I'm still in disbelief as I honestly think I just finished one of the greatest horror games of all time.\n\nBefore I actually start this review, I want you to ensure that this game is for you. And that is because this game is a little bit more 'Machine for Pigs' than 'Dark Descent'. And by that, I mean that the game is heavily story based. While the gameplay and puzzles wasn't as lost such as in Machine for Pigs, it is very clear that Frictional Games made the story top priority. So if you were expecting Dark Descent 2........ sorry.\n\nNow to actually start the review and while on the subject of story............. Jesus Christ. The story for this game is beyond fantastic. I was completely memorized from beginning to end and the pacing of the game was perfect. The game does begin off slow but I don't consider that a bad thing. The story and the horror slowly develop over the course of the game building into this disturbing and horrifying tale. It doesn't show all its cards at once, it pulls them out slowly, 1 by 1.\n\nI also loved the themes behind the game. The way the game deals with the themes of moral choice, what it means to be human, the emotion of AI is all very intelligent. The game doesn't treat you like you 4 years old. It lets you uncover the story yourself and put the pieces together. It doesn't feed you novels filled with exposition. It is up to you to interpret the story. And you do this through multiple ways such as audio recordings, photographs, writing on the walls, flashbacks and emails. And Frictional were kind enough to make these evidences short and sweet. You don't need to read through pages and pages of diary entries to patch the story together. This makes the game much more enjoyable as it actually encourages players to find this information. Some players may have been turned off by the long diary entries in Dark Descent; however that is not the case in this game.\n\nNow something I have heard about this game is that people don't think it is scary. While I don't consider this game to be as scary as Frictional's previous game (specifically Dark Descent), I feel like people saying the game wasn't scary at all are exaggerating a bit. As mentioned earlier the game does begin off slow, so the game does get way more terrifying later on. And considering (at the time of making the review) only 20% of people have achieved the 'The End' achievement, I don’t think enough people have given the game its proper chance. Because trust me, the game gets bloody terrifying near the end. And here is the kicker. The game is entirely psychological horror. No jump scares, no cheap shots, pure horror. Which is a breath of fresh air for the modern horror genre.\n\nHowever, I don't think a horror game needs to be necessarily scary to be good. And I say that because there are so many other factors which go into a horror game rather than the scares. And this is where SOMA shines above many other horror games.\n\nThe atmosphere, the sound effects, the visuals, the imagery, the dialogue, the music, the voice acting, the lighting are all SUPERB. This is easily one of the most atmospheric games I have ever played. Just walking underwater was an amazing experience. I spent a lot of time just exploring the areas because I was so intrigued by the environment. So when people put this game down because "it wasn't scary", they're ignoring all these other factors which the game succeeds in. In fact, I would describe this game more as spooky, disturbing and creepy than scary. Which is actually a really impressive thing. It isn't hard for a game to quickly scare a player. But it is extremely difficult for a game to keep players spooked and disturbed for 10 hours.\n\nBut no game is perfect. And to make this review fair, I will point out some drawback(s) of the game. The main drawback is optimization and glitch issues. My FPS for the game suddenly dropped to single frames at certain points of the game which really breaks the immersion. And this normally occurs during very important scenes. But I'm sure that in the future patches will fix this issue easily. However some of the bugs and crashes I experienced with this game are a big problem. I had 3 crashes in the game. While the game is quite generous with its auto saves, it still sucks when you get devoted into the game and suddenly get greeted with an error message. Some of the glitches are pretty frustrating also. To put it in perspective (and not spoiling anything), during the last 20 minutes of the game I was hit by a monster into a bunch of rocks in which I couldn't escape. Occurring during a very heart-racing chase scene, this not only broke my immersion but it ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off. However as mentioned before, I'm sure these can be easily fixed with patches.\n\nAnd any other con I have with the game I so freaking miniscule that it isn't even worth pointing out. So overall, I really do recommend this game. As I said, I did just finish the game so maybe I'm blinded. But I honestly haven't had this feeling of astonishment after finishing a game in a very long time. So if you like horror, if you like story based games, if you like disturbing stories, then BUY THIS GAME. This is a very different type of horror game and that is a good thing. In a time where the horror genre is booming and it seems 'mostly' the same. It's good to have something extremely unique.\n\ntldr;  it’s good.\n","September 28, 2015","true","11.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

About where we draw the lines between what we are, what we could be, and what's worth living for. It is a game about the soul, about what it means to be alive, and to what end we accept living. It's about the misfortune of birth, about the terror of living, and in an absolutely shocking moment, suicide and the right to live.\n\nIf that sounds heavy and artsy...well, that's because it is. But it's handled with elegance and care, without ever becoming a straight Walking Simulator.

It's not an action game either, and I feel that anyone who comes in for challenge gameplay or jumpscare fodder will leave unfullfilled.

It was a Day-1 release, great graphics and performance even on RadeonSI open drivers. If you are Linux enthusiast and looking for holiday play of non-competitive, story-driven game, SOMA is a good candidate for your money.\n\nAbout the game: The closest thing I could relate SOMA to, is legendary System Shock series. Story is surprisingly similar, with a cybernetic protagonist, unknown environment and AI entities similar to Shodan/Xerxes. It is a survival story-driven single player game, where you have to solve basic puzzles and environmental obstacles to progress through levels and advance the story. It is an enjoyable experience with some horror elements. The difference in gameplay compared to System Shock or Undying, is that you have no weapons, inventory or meanings to defend yourself. It is not a shooter like Alien: Isolation or even Thief: Deadly Shadows. You have to use the environment in your favour and sneak through the level. There are only couple of monsters in the whole game, but they are more like nuisance than real opponents though.\nThe only thing that bothered me was the lack of ingame journal/log/notes, where you could check for active quest status. Sometimes you have to find specific items or put them in a specific slot, however instructions are often given through hints or written stickies on the wall. After the dialog is through, you have no way to check the status and you are left in the dark (or check the walkthrough).\n\nAnyway, SOMA is a decent linear story driven survival game, perfect for chilly winter holidays.","December 29, 2015","true","9.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The story is fascinating, the visuals amazing and the universe very immersive while keeping the gameplay very simple.\n\nI'd never have never imagined that running along a pathway through almost complete obscurity, only lit by scattered blue lights in a -3km deep abyss, mourning unavoidable deaths, trying to understand what went so terribly wrong when Pathos-II research facility was overcome by a cancerous form of consciousness whose attempts to save mankind are little by little destroying it, and following a vague and dim hope of saving what can still be saved, could turn out to be such a hazardous and rewarding experience...\n\nIf I tried to come up with some negative comment, that would be:\n- the redish, blurred vision following harm done to the character gives headache;\n- some puzzles are a bit too easy to figure out; perhaps scattering the "pieces" of the puzzles throughout some areas would have made them a bit more interesting (i.e. you not only have to work out the logics once you understand what the puzzle is made of -- you also have to figure out what counts as a piece of the puzzle and how the different pieces make up the puzzle).","January 2","true","14.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Being the developer who created Amnesia, which essentially defined the “hide and seek” gameplay, they have some pretty big shoes to fill. Especially after the second Amnesia, A Machine for Pigs, was not received as well.\n\nSOMA takes place in an underwater science facility called PATHOS-2, and man, it’s f*&$ing gorgeous! The atmosphere has a perfect mixture of both horror and wonder. Wondering the dark underwater tunnels was extremely immersive for me and although I was pretty on edge for the duration of my play, I was still compelled to explore the environment around me. Putting aside the fact that you have to look around anyway to solve most puzzles. Which is another reason I liked it, SOMA does not hold your hand unless you ask for it.  Although, the puzzles themselves were a bit easy, you still have to figure your way around. Often resulting in some frantic chase sequences when the monster appears! The sound alone when this thing is around you is terrifying in its own right. The guys at Frictional put a tremendous effort in the quality of sound in this game. Playing without a good headset would be a crime, missing all the little creeks and bumps going on everywhere around you. Although, the voice acting could use a bit of work honestly but the story and what’s being conveyed more than makes up for it. The story is the best part of the game yet. It’s refreshing finding a game with such amazing and thought provoking story. I honestly would’ve called this a perfect game if not for the voice acting and some issues with the A.I. There’s nothing worse in a horror game that can happen other than when the monster is no longer a threating. As we learned in Slender (whomp whomp), this can happen when the monster’s A.I. gets STUCK. This happened to me twice and the weird thing was it was in the strangest places. There wasn’t a box in front of them or some kind of tricky object, sometimes it just looked like they were stuck on some clipping from walls! I was confused at first, even to the point where I was throwing objects at them, hoping they would snap out of it or something, but nope…I could just move on without impediment.\n\nTL;DR All in all, the game is awesome. I think it’s safe to say that Frictional Games was able to meet the huge standard from their previous games. Although there were some minor complaints, some may not even experience the same issues. It’s seriously not too often a game has so little downside. With a 30 USD price tag, this game is definitely worth buying. Out of 10, I’d give this an easy 9.","October 9, 2015","true","9.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

When you start this game, you may feel like it's a bit slow, but it's for a good reason.  Give it a chance and it'll get scary.  I found myself jumping a few times.  I'm the kind of person who will get scared at a  thing like Outlast, but not Slender, so if you're anything like that, you'll like this game.  It picks up around the end of the first quarter.  The coolest part of this game is that it's not only a 'try to survive and get out', but instead it brings a whole new aspect into play.  I don't wnat to go too in depth, because I'd liek you to experience it yourself, but let me tell you, it will have you in amazement at the complex ideas this game has to offer.  It has you asking questions the whole time, only to be answered later in the game.  So is it worth oyur money?  Heck yes.

The environments are really well done and the lighting is superb. I think that the funnest thing about this game was walking through these creaky, sort of Alien inspired interiors with 20xx computers instead of 1970's style computers. People also say it has a lot of Bioshock influence and you can definitely see that as well. There's also some nice, but simple puzzles that I enjoyed.\nThe game is mainly story driven and the narrative is a commentary on what it means to be human. It's been done. "If you prick us, do we not bleed," or "All those moments lost in time, like tears in rain."\nJust because something has been done before doesn't mean it can't be good. The problem is that I felt a complete lack of connection with the protagonist and his hammy acting. The story iterates his probable predicament and he acts like he didn't understand, while the player knows exactly what to expect. It isn't heartbreaking or anything. I just didn't feel for the guy at all.\nThe only other thing I didn't like was the monster AI. It ran on patrols for the most part and was sensitive to either seeing you or hearing you. After you figured that bit out it wasn't very scary.\n\nSo, why am i recommending it? Despite the major flaw in the story, the game is fun and drove me all the way to the end without any teeth grinding. There is also mod support, but I haven't seen whether or not anyone has put together some nice new stories in the HPL engine with these great assets.","February 18","true","10.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

More often than not these ideas bubble up slowly over time, with only a small numer of heavyhanded moral or expository moments scattered across the 8-12 hours of play.  From a mechanical perspective it follows Amnesia fairly closely, deviating most in that (unlike Amnesia) you can in fact be killed by the creatures you encounter, and that there is more than one variety of enemy stalking you through the game.  The design is almost uniformly excellent, so much so that the few merely passable segments stand out in sharp contrast with the rest of the experience.  To this I'll speak with encouragement and also warning to prospective players: the sections directly before and directly after a certain elevator are by far the least pleasant part of the journey in terms of unintentional frustration.  They feel like they were designed very early on in the game's life cycle and never effectively revisited.  There's much more game to be had beyond them, though, so bite your lip and muscle through.\n\nBuy this game!  Play it!

I'm not particularly a fan or horror games, but I was amazed at how well SOMA was able to pull off the horror vibe without overdoing it with say, jump scares. Instead, it's  subtle . All the while, this game maintains an incredible storyline, using an idea that I've never seen in another game before. SOMA is, as the tags would suggest, quite atmospheric, and from my experience, I'd say that it's one of the most immersive games I have ever played. If you're thinking about purchasing SOMA,  do it .\n\nThis is definately one of my favorite games, as it is truely astonishing how brilliant it is.","January 9","true","22.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dude195/recommended/282140/","dude195","Crio","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dude195/","211 products in account","What. A. Ride. This. Was.\n\nLong time Frictional Games fan here, and I can gladly say that they did not disappoint once again. I loved Penumbra for its doom-looming vibe and how the most scary part was the story. I feel like Frictional went back to this formula and really strived from it.\n\nThis is not a typical survival horror; the enemies are probably the easiest part. With a little bit of careful maneuvering, you can avoid the enemies completely. I'm pretty sure the enemies were put in just to get the typical scary game audience to play. Yahtzee of Zero Punctuation sums the enemies up fantastically, so you should check out his review of the game. The real freakish nature is in the story, the atmosphere, the setting, and a moral grey area Frictional decided to play with.\n\nI wanna call it a hard sci-fi game, but that genre kinda comes with a "boring" sticker slapped on it. This is not a boring game. It's action packed with plenty of "holy ♥♥♥♥" moments, whether it be from the sudden collapse of a structure or from a stunning emotional realization. Like I said, Frictional plays with the idea of existence and they take it pretty far, enough to make my heart stop at some points.\n\nThe visuals are stunning. The whole game takes place at the bottom of the ocean which calls for some pretty amazing environments. It's a huge step up from Amnesia, their artists really took some double time with this one. I have a huge fear of deep sea, so you could imagine how I felt when I saw all the creepy crawly details. The monsters were well designed, but unfortunately had very little screen time to be admired. The amount of character renders and portraits were also an amazing feat from such a small studio.\n\nTHE AUDIO DESIGN, OH MY GOD. The audio in this game is SO GOOD. It took me close to 20 minutes to get past the very beginning of the game because I was having so much fun listening to all the impact sounds from every little prop in the room. The ambience, the machinery, the physics, every bit had so much detail and quality put into the audio aspect. It's such a breath of fresh air from all the dull stock sounds devs have been using recently. Also Mikko Tarmia! He's been around since Penumbra, his style is so very unique. His scores have been inspiring me for years, I often listen to his work while writing to get in the mood. And of course, he did not disappoint again. You should really look at Frictional's behind the scenes videos, Tarmia has such a unique way of creating his music.\n\nThe story... I can't talk about the story... It's best to go in completely blind. Trust me, it's gonna make you think of some grey areas that most of us try not to think about. It's a ♥♥♥♥in' rollercoaster, that's all I can say.\n\nOverall, Frictional Games knocked this one out of the park. Black Plague used to be my favorite of their games, but I'm pretty sure this one is on top. If you loved the Penumbra series, you will ADORE this one. If you're a returning Amnesia fan and enjoyed the atmosphere, then you'll enjoy this. If you're looking for a heart-racing survival horror, then you might be disappointed. This is a sci-fi horror game, it scares you in ways that don't rely on chasey-runny scenes.\n\nIt's a game for people looking for a new experience. Frictional took HUGE risks with this game, and it surely paid off. You at least gotta give them some applause for taking those risks head-on and releasing this one-of-a-kind existential thriller.","February 3","true","11.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I really don't know why there haven't been more horror games set in this deep ocean environment.\n\nI'm not an expert on horror games, but the gameplay was pretty tense and had some elements that I hadn't ever experienced before though I don't want to share them here for the sake of spoilers. That's just something you really have to find out for yourself to get the optimal appreciation out of it.\n\nThe voice acting was probably the only gripe I might have. While the two main protagonists were decent for the most part, pretty much every other performance was unconvincing to laughable. Might just be my opinion though. I literally did laugh at one particular segment.\n\nThe story though.... wow... I will remember this story for the rest of my life. The dialogue was perfectly written with monologues that will keep you up at night pondering the universe and your place in it as well as others that overcome the mediocre voice acting to bring you to the verge of tears. The plot progression was very well executed, throwing you into a setting with no idea what is going on and just when you think you've figured out "the big twist of the game" they reveal it only to introduce more questions for you to figure out all over again some of which are never answered in the game and leave you to ponder on your own time.\n\nThere are very few horror stories that I just don't want to end, and SOMA is definitely one of them. A must play for gamers, non-gamers, horror lovers, horror haters alike. Every one should play this game.","May 2","true","21.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

In usual Amnesia fashion, you're unable to look at enemies and you can do nothing against them. Thankfully, enemy placement is pretty infrequent, so the game largely leaves you alone to explore the world at your own pace.\n\nSOMA is easily worth the MSRP of $30.00, so don't hesitate to buy it if you can get it on sale.","November 6, 2015","true","6.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Every element is near perfect, from the stunningly realised world of Pathos 2 and the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean, to the incredible sound design that physically wrenches you out of your seat and transports you into protagonist Simon's nightmare world, not to mention the flawless pacing that expertly intertwines periods of calm exploration and philosophical musing with breathless sequences of heart-stopping terror, building inexorably towards a magnificent crescendo.\n\nTo reveal anything of the story would be to spoil it but suffice it to say I was utterly engrossed from start to finish and went to great pains to track down every last audio recording, email, call log and journal entry. I even tracked down all the hastily-written notes hidden away in drawers or pinned to notice boards in order to absorb every detail I could. And what exceptional detail there is to be found - by the end of the game I'd built up a mental timeline of everything that had happened at Pathos 2 over approximately an 18 month period, pieced together from the various snippets of information I'd found. Everything is consistent and believable and cements in place the feeling that this is a real facility and was only recently populated by dozens of people before something went very, very wrong.\n\nSOMA isn't as terrifying a proposition as developer Frictional's previous game, Amnesia, but that certainly isn't to say it's not frightening. The atmosphere is thick and foreboding, the clangs, creaks and groans of the facility around you menacing and, on more than one occasion, I became so spooked out I simply couldn’t continue. At these moments I would stare at the corridor or ladder I had to navigate next for full minutes, the deeply unsettling ambient sounds around me only serving to further increase the tension, before eventually admitting defeat and leaving the game altogether. Despite this, it’s clear a deliberate decision has been made to turn the horror down a notch, presumably to make the game accessible to a wider audience. This is a bold choice, given Frictional’s pedigree, but one that I applaud as it allows SOMA’s story to take centre stage and gives it room to breathe.\n\nWith SOMA, Frictional have proved beyond doubt that they are masters of the horror genre and have demonstrated that they’re pretty well-versed in science fiction and story-telling as well. It’s not often that the many disparate parts of a computer game coalesce this coherently but somehow they’ve managed the impossible and have crafted the finest horror experience since Amnesia.","October 11, 2015","true","19.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

For this review I will give the pros et cons and compare Soma to these games.\n\nPros:\n\n- The story is great, even if the robot-intelligence theme is used a lot these days, I think Frictional Games used it very well in a new philosophic perspective.\n\n-The puzzles are nice... not too easy, not too hard, and you have a great feeling of accomplishment when you find out what to do and you can move on. I didn't have to look online to find out what to do.\n\n- Nice details in the informative aspects of the game (the pictures, notes and recording you find). It helps to create a good atmosphere and immersion.\n\n- The narration is excellent.\n\n- The atmosphere is great.\n\n- There are hard decisions to make and you have to think about it. I liked it.\n\n- There are a lot of times in the game where I had the feeling of being lost and vulnerable, but I always find out naturally where to go and never got stuck. Consequently, I think the game is well done for that.\n\n- The end is very good.\n\nCons:\n\n- The length of the game. In my opinion, it is relatively ok for this type of game, in which there are stressfull moments and a deep story, but I understand it can be expensive at full price for a 11-13h game (I did it in 12.7 hours and I looked at everything possible). I will play it again someday and I will mod it of course.\n\n- The graphic are mostly good, but It seems like they didn't put the same effort on everything. Some objects are very well defined and others not.\n\n- The horror in the game is also mostly good, but it could have been better. It is not the main aspect of the game like it is for Amnesia. The story and atmosphere is way more important and it think it's ok like that.\n\n- I don't know if it's my computer of something, but the game lagged sometimes when I was switching a zone to another.\n\nConclusion:\n\nI would give 8.7/10 to Soma. It is a great game and I don't regret my buy at all. To compare it to Amnesia, Outlast and Dead Space, I would say that each game has his main aspect and it's a question of taste.\n\nFor a pure-horror game, Amnesia is still the best for me. The atmosphere and horror are so great, but the story is not very good.\n\nOutlast is also pure-horror, with better graphic, but I prefer the style of Ammesia. Outlast horror is hardcore... mostly chase and non-stop stressfull moments. It can be annoying sometimes.\n\nDead Space is my least favorite of the 4 games. The gameplay is nice, the story is ok and the horror aspect is not strong compared to the others... and its EA...That's all I have to say.\n\nSoma has by far the best story, narration and details in everythings. It has also the best atmosphere with Amnesia, depending on the kind you prefer. Even if it will not revolutionize the genre like Amnesia did, it is the best game of the 4 in 2016 for sure.","April 19","true","14.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SpaceReacher/recommended/282140/","SpaceReacher","Spacey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SpaceReacher/","246 products in account","A New You.\nThe latest nightmare from Frictional Games. You play as Simon. A survivor of a crash, diagnosed with brain damage. One day, you go in for a not so ordinary scan. Only to wake up in an unfamiliar place. Questioning not only where you are. But, who or what you are. You're certainly won't be the same after this is all over. Are you even alive?\n\nNothing gets my blood pumping like a good horror game and SOMA delivers just that. I'll start off by saying that one of my greatest fears are the depths of the oceans. Areas where if you look up, there's nothingness. Pitch black. The abyss. There were times where I had to pause and take a break to catch my breath. I digress.. Frictional Games tried their hand at something new, and it worked so well. We've explored the mines of Penumbra, the gothic castle of Amnesia, the butchery of the Machine. Now it's time to go underwater to the research facility - PATHOS-2.\n\nPros:\n\nGameplay\nLike its predecessors, SOMA will have you running and hiding from creatures, collecting and building items, upgrading chips and using your OmniTool. A little of it feels familiar while a lot of it feels new and crisp. Each step leaves you either wanting or fearing more. The creature segments are well thought out and planned. You're the mouse in the maze, with lots of dead ends. The 'glitching' you'll receive when you're nearby enemies or certain scenes fit perfectly with who/what you are.\n\nStory\nThe story is really unique. I don't want to talk too much about it. You'll have to play and find out for yourselves. It's more sci-fi than gothic/London. The story touches a lot on the line between reality and virtuality. Humans and AIs. Scans and scans... It plays on itself so well. It's an existential science fictional crisis on a huge scale. You'll meet both friendly and hostile creatures and robots. Some of which progress the plot even more. The story is one that will keep me up at night wondering what if, who am, what are's for a long time to come. It leaves it's imprint.\n\nMusic\nThe music and sounds fit right where they are. Under the sea. Mikko Tarmia brings to life the sounds that will chill you to the core. The synthesizers crawl under your skin and disturb you deeply. From brooding, to alien.. Isolation and robotic, hopeful and saddening.. It’s an amazing sound track which I wish they would've added to the store page. Maybe someday.\n\nVoice Acting\nThe two leads work wonderful (both, with each other and on their own.) and put effort and life into the characters you'll be playing and hearing. None of it sounds boring or as if they weren't having fun doing. And from time to time you'll get a laugh or two from the comedic relief.\n\nArtwork and Locations\nThe game takes place in two locations. The underwater labs and the ocean floor. Both look vibrant and beautiful when they need to and gloomy and tragic, scary or lonely when they have to. I was taken aback at how terrifying and hungry the depths of the ocean looked. As I said, I had to step away and catch my breath. The insides are well done. The lighting plays tricks on your eyes when it needs to which helps set the mood.\n\nCreatures\nEach station or lab you venture to seems to have it's own set creature/robot. They're all different and require (if you dare) you to get a better, up close and personal look at them. Some will chase you while others will help you. Not only are the creatures inside a threat, the outside ones, in the ocean are even scarier.\n\nRewarding\nEach triumph over an area and their designated creatures gives you a sensation of success before immediately taking you back under and into the abyss to deal with another one. As you progress you'll feel more and more achieved. Or as if you're finally reaching the hope you need.\n\nReplay Value\nTerrorizing me for 15+ hours, I can say there is a little bit of replay value, not much. There are some choices to make, which I haven't learned control a certain outcome or not. There are bits of intel or lore which I'm sure I missed and dialogue worth replaying for. Aside from that, it's a great game for a great price which I'll be replaying for sure if not for the lore than simply for the unique story.\n\n\nPluses:\n\nTherapy\nIf the game worked it's magic you're going to need therapy for the existential crisis you're going to have when it's all over. Thanks, Frictional!\n\n\nConclusion:\nSOMA is a much enjoyed addition to the Frictional Game's library. Offering something new and old you'll feel the usual fear that comes with it. Terrorizing you with either it's feeling of isolation, the sea, the depths, the robots, the blurred line between it all. You’ll be glad you picked this game up. I can easily recommend this game if you're a fan of horror and or sci-fi. If you enjoy running and hiding with the bigger picture plot in the background, this is the game for you. I pre-purchased this game for 10% off and was worth every penny. If I hadn't I would've picked it up at it's current price tag. If you love horror. Get this game. Now. Otherwise wait until a sale or until Halloween, whatever your fancy is, you've got to play this game.\n\nIf you are reading this, you have successfully entered the ARK.","September 23, 2015","true","18.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It has a very interesting story and a game world which helps tell it. The games length is roughly 10 hours or more depending on how much you explore and listen to the games story. I assume it can be done faster but you'll be skipping a lot which defeats the purpose.\n\nThe games pacing is pretty good but in some areas you get a bit confused on your sense of direction and sometimes it keeps certain scenes feeling like they're going on for an eternity. The atmosphere is amazing and you always feel like you're in the games world that they imagined - never feeling disconnected from that. As for the puzzles and objectives they require some brain work and you may even get stuck for some minutes when it was something silly like just putting in a plug.\n\nAs for options the game has plenty which are more easily editable in the games config found in my documents\soma. It includes field of view, framerate uncapping, setting resolutions and so fourth. Mostly everything is boolean/integer values so it's easily adjustable for the average blue collar like ourselves (ha). The games performance is fair, the engine unfortunately didn't play as smooth for me as I'd like but that could be due to my aging hardware? I'm not sure but to put it in an easy to understand way basically 150 fps doesn't feel like 150 fps.\n\nThe controls are fine, the mouse input is fine, and the game options are fine. This game lacks the survival aspect that amnesia had by not having you collect resources needed to keep your light running (or your sanity) which added difficulty. Also this game is a bit more forgiving when getting caught by the monsters which I wish it wasn't. Having to start far back after being taken out by a monster would add fear in that you don't want to lose progress.\n\nSo I give the game a 8.5/10 total. It's a really great game but I just wish they had maybe one more year to really test it on various machines and polish it up some more. It ran good.. but I would of loved it more if it ran GREAT. It came packed with an editor and steam workshop support so I cannot wait for more custom content. I applaud their work and was happy to purchase this game. Frictional does great stuff and I'll continue to follow them as they develop more games or whatever it is they will do in the future.","September 27, 2015","true","10.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Somethingneu/recommended/282140/","Somethingneu","SomethingNeu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Somethingneu/","448 products in account","QUICK SUMMARY\n\nStarting off, I want to say that this game has been added to my list of top games I've ever played. Yes, it is flawed, but overall it's an amazing game that is worth playing.\n\nThe Good\nAtmosphere\nMoral Choices\nStory\nThe Bad\nAmnesia monsters feel unnecessary\nProtagonist voice acting falls a bit flat\nSPOLIER FREE THOUGHTS\n\nThe game is set up as the normal Amnesia game is. Protagonist wakes up in a strange environment and is forced to press forward to discover more about his environment and himself. This is an average set up, but from there the game diverges into new territory and touches on topics and subjects that are horrifying in their implications.\n\nIf you go into this expecting the usual Amnesia horror gameplay, you'll get exactly that. The thing is, that's not the draw here. The usual sneaking around avoiding monsters feels a bit out of place in the overall theme of the story. Especially after you reach the end and learn a few plot twists, which makes you question the whole point of monsters, other than to satisfy the monster requirement of an Amnesia game.\n\nFinally, 'SOMA' touches on moral choices in a way that is perfect. They don't really affect the outcome of the story, but they can be very subtle and actually cause you to stop and think. They cause you to question you character, the environment you're in, and those you travel with.\n\nAs a side note, it usually didn't bother me, but Simon (protagonist) has a pretty bad voice actor. He does a good job for the most part, but sometimes his line delivery sounds a bit off compared to the rest of the cast.\n\nSPOILER FILLED THOUGHTS\n\nThe thing that stood out on this game was the way it does horror. Yes there is the usual Amnesia horror elements, but they are second fiddle to the real horror on display. The topics they touch on are what is really horrifiying, such as what defines "human", is a copy of a brain as much a person as the original? What counts as "living"?\n\nAll of these questions become more and more crushing as you're forced to continue on you journey. What's done even better is the moral choices and how amazingly subtle they can be. The one that stands out the most is when you enter an evelator near the end of the game. It asks for how many pasangers are riding it and you actually stop and think, does Catherine, the AI on the omnitool, count as a passenger? I sat there for a few seconds deciding if I should select 1 or 2. After I realized I was actually putting thought into that made me appriciate how subtle a moral choice that is.\n\nOther choices that made me stop and think were if I should kill Simon 2.0, should I unplug the various beings being kept alive by WAU, and finally, should WAU be killed.\n\nThese choices were very difficult and made me think about them before taking action. The choices and their outcomes are far supirior to anything TellTale has ever put out.\n\nAgain, I can not reccommend this game enough. I needed something to sratch that horror itch and this game satisfied that far beyond expectations.\n","December 1, 2015","true","8.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If there is one thing I absolutely love about Frictional Games, it is how they propose such intriguing inquiries upon the human mind. SOMA falls nothing short of such intrigue as found in the Amnesia series--though, indeed, its aproach is vastly different.\nOverall, I would have to give this game an 8/10. The beginning is what captured me. I found myself in nerdvana as I explored the dark unknowns of a place I was so desperate to learn about. Who would have thought two of my favorite game settings would somehow collide in such mystery? If you enjoy mystery, dark atmospheres, exploration, psychological twisters, and flight-or-die kind of games, definitely dont pass this up. Though I would highly recommend starting with Amnesia.\nThe game primarily suffered from the sudden approach of "gore" to add to the already amassing bazzlement (did I just invent that?) of exploration. There were a few parts that kept me feeling distant and not quite informed as I would have liked to have been, and because of that I was unable to fully enjoy some of the story points.

From the moment you start walking around Omicron you are reminded that things aren't what they should be.\nI had an amazing time with this game as the visuals are stunning. The movement is fluid and the sounds are terrifying. The enemies are easy enough to get around with enough patience. What really makes this game the amazing peice of work that it is, is what it does to you emotionally.

I hadn't heard too much about this game when it released and I bought it expecting a similar experience to Penumbra/Amnesia. What I wasn't expecting was for it to be one of my favorite games I've ever played. SOMA is different from Frictional's previous titles in that it's not a horror game first and foremost. Yes, the atmosphere is very tense and the sound design is SUPERB which helps immerse this tense setting. And yes, there are moments that are truly terrifying, but the horror is created to accent the environment and the story rather than be the focus of the game.\n\nHonestly, this game floored me with its presentation. The atmosphere, the story, the characters, I was CAPTIVATED through and through. After the game was done, the moral dilemmas and the state of the world/characters left me thinking about what happened for weeks after I had finished. 2015 has been a big year for AAA titles and I think it'd be a shame for this game to go too under the radar.","November 29, 2015","true","8.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Meets the standards Frictional Games set for themselves in their heyday (Amnesia: The Dark Descent, and Penumbra)\n\nThe atmosphere oozes from each setting in the game. Audio is excellent and adds so much to the tension. Environment visuals are great, but I found character models slightly funny looking. I love that you can pick up and interact with so many objects in the world, unlike the Machine For Pigs walking simulator.\n\nScares and scary situations are plentiful. It's great that Frictional Games is able to scare you without always relying on darkness as a crutch. I found myself tense throughout a larger portion of the game than I remember for their previous titles. Definitely got an adrenaline rush a few times, and I had to take breaks in some of the areas.\n\nThe dialogue in general is entertaining, but at some points the main character's philosophical musings are too in-your-face and even repetitive. The overall story is pretty good, pieced together gradually as you progress through the game, including a lot of optional text and sound clips.\n\nThe pacing is excellent. The game is pretty linear, which was important to keeping the game's momentum going.\n\nConclusion: Must play, if you can stomach scary games.","December 1, 2015","true","11.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Very Isaac Asimovian/Philip K Dickian tale of what it means to be human, coupled with the most unique take on brain uploading I've ever seen.  A pinnacle of videogame storytelling achievement, if ever I've seen one.\n\nNot to say its not scary in a more traditional videogame way, though.  You know its a Frictional Games work when you hide in a corner for twenty minutes because you know theres a monster running around (even when there isnt one) and you really dont want it to catch you.  But I can't think of any jump scares.  Just tense scares.\n\nAlso, great setting, great voice acting, great monster design, and great scott that ending made me want to cry.  and the after-credits sequence didnt help.\n\nBut I think the best take-away is that this game feels like it was done for the love of cerebal scares and the setting and the story and etc and it doesnt feel like pewdiebait, and thats really saying something in this modern day and age.","October 7, 2015","true","9.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You'll find yourself pondering your decisions and wondering where the path in this foreign and frightening world will eventually lead.

In fact, Frictional Games took SOMA a big step further and challenge your thoughts and even your sanity at times, towards the big revelation of what are you and what do you do once all you knew is gone.\n\nSOMA is an exploration game, albeit some places are hard to explore since you can get chased down in some different section of the undersea PATHOS II base but you get the point!\n\nYou are Simon, waking up in the PATHOS II undersea base and, once you get your bearing and trying to figure out what is going on, you go on an important mission to save yourself from constant threats around many corners. I don't want to say too more and I want you, the gamer, to experience this game without reading too much about this game. Experience it yourself, at your own pace and process everything the game shows you till the very end.\n\nThe visuals, atmosphere, voice acting... all superb! The undersea floor is amazing. It's bringing the good vibes of BioShock when you were walking on the ocean floor.\n\nThe pacing can be tedious at some parts and once an enemy as seen you, you get a hard time evading it.\n\nPROS:+Engaging story that keep you guessing until the very end.\n+Solid voice acting.\n+Music and sound adds to the dread of SOMA. Put some killer headphones and you're set! Don't forget to play in the dark too!\n+The atmosphere keeps you on your toes for the grand majority of the game.\n\nCONS:-Tedious enemies once encountered.\n-Pacing can be off at times while when you are trying to figure out what to do and where to go.\n-No worthy exploration besides just going from where you are told. While the Ocean floor is very well done, don't scatter too far since it is pointless. I'd say there is long distances between areas in the ocean floor so just run and you'll save time!\n\nOVERALL:This game is... wow. This game is amazing. I really hope we get to see more of SOMA since I was drawn to keep going until I see the big picture of "what the hell is going on here".\n\nRECOMMENDATION:Absolutely! Best game of Frictional Games to date and they keep getting better and better. If you loved Amnesia: The Dark Descent, you'll feel at home here! SOMA is as creepy as Amnesia except in a sci-fi setting. I hope this new IP expand so we could experience more of the new world these developers made for us.\n\nThere is a live-action fan made web series that I'm recommending highly as well.Here's the link of the First Episode:  SOMA Live-Action Video Series ~ Transmission #1\n\nRATING:9.0 / 10\n\nPS: The only spoiler I'll give was somewhat, a disappointment to me. It is the pre-alpha footage that was shown back in early 2013 and it featured a creepier tone. Sadly, the footage is NOT part of the game. Still, the game is fantastic and maybe this "removed parts" could be restored later via a DLC or in a sequel... who knows!\n\nSo here's the footage:  SOMA - Debut Gameplay Trailer","September 29, 2015","true","14.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

What an amazing game.\n\nYou'd be doing yourself a huge favour by going into the game as a blank slate. Just stay away from the internet, or walkthroughs or anything of the sort. Your whole experience will be worth it.\n\nDespite what the tags say, this isn't really a horror game. Sure there are parts that make your blood curdle and the game and the setting can be genuinely creepy. But what stood out for me in this game are the actual themes behind it. It really shakes you up psychologically, more so than other story-driven games, and it makes you reflect on yourself as a human being. The choices you make in the game have no consequences and don't alter the ending of the game in any way. But the choices stay with you. And I'm sure that the choices I made today are going to keep me awake at night. I'm not even a person who gets hugely attached to games. But I assure you, this one just draws you in.\n\nI just have one tip for you when you're playing this game:\nJust relax, take your time while you're playing through it and explore the world around you. Learn more about it and get immersed in it. It'll make your choices seem all the more "real".\n\nWhat are you waiting for?\nSeriously, play this game.

The story is the core element of this game, which draws into question the very nature of what life and death are. The video quality of the game is pretty good, with an adequate amount of customization options.\n\nThe Story;\n\nYour character wakes up in an underground sea lab, trying to figure out where you are and how to escape the dangerous area you are in. You face intelligent AI, robots who believe they are human, and other hybrid elements that draw into question what it means to truly be human, and who has the right to proclaim whether they are alive or dead? The environments, music and puzzles give an overall atmosphere of fear, without the ever present jump scares that are found in so many so-called horror genre games. The story throws you into situations where you have to make hard decisions that may be uncomfortable for some, and makes you think about how life is defined both inside and outside of the game, and it synchronizes everything together in a beautiful matter. The only issue I had with the story was that the decisions you make throughout the game do not make any impact on the ending. The story itself stands on it's own, and the ending fits well, it would have been nice to have multiple ending options that would reflect the decisions you have made.\n\nThe Monsters;\n\nThe monsters in the game do have a feeling of weight behind them, and they do a good job when they are used minimally. The game did a good job of spacing them out so you weren't expecting them around every corner. They are dangerous, and they can kill you. The system is forgiving when you are killed, as you are given at least two chances to retry before you are sent back to the previous checkpoint. The checkpoints occur fairly frequently, so you don't have to replay too much to gain what you lost. The main issue I have with the monsters is how your character reacts when you see them onscreen. You have a chip in your head that reacts to the monsters, so the screen will shake and distort. It can be a good concept but is overdone. It is more annoying than suspenseful, as it was intended. The enemy is like a dog with a bone; once they see you, even if you find a place to hide, they will sit right there for you, and you are not able to use objects to block or slow them down, or to lock a door to escape them (they open doors easily),  pushing the player more towards trying to outrun the monsters rather than using a stealth, or witty approach.\n\nSummary;\n\nThe environment is beautifully done, and ties everything together well, and the story delves into personal exploration into what it means to be human. They puzzles, while simplistic, are still satisfying and fit into the story. The monsters are the games strongest environmental aid, and it's weakest gameplay mechanic. They help to add a sense of fear or dread, and they don't overstay their welcome, but when they are there, the violent screen shake takes away immersion into the game. I did not feel as if my time was wasted, and I enjoyed the strong story. I would say the game is definitely worth $20, but for its current $30 on Steam, I would like to see a bit more replay-ability.Then again it does have access to Steam workshop so you have to decide what the strong story and possible extra content via Steam workshop is worth to you?\n\nThanks for your viewership and support; for more videos check click here.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho","October 15, 2015","true","13.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

In fact, Frictional Games took SOMA a big step further and challenge your thoughts and even your sanity at times, towards the big revelation of what are you and what do you do once all you knew is gone.\n\nSOMA is an exploration game, albeit some places are hard to explore since you can get chased down in some different section of the undersea PATHOS II base but you get the point!\n\nYou are Simon, waking up in the PATHOS II undersea base and, once you get your bearing and trying to figure out what is going on, you go on an important mission to save yourself from constant threats around many corners. I don't want to say too more and I want you, the gamer, to experience this game without reading too much about this game. Experience it yourself, at your own pace and process everything the game shows you till the very end.\n\nThe visuals, atmosphere, voice acting... all superb! The undersea floor is amazing. It's bringing the good vibes of BioShock when you were walking on the ocean floor.\n\nThe pacing can be tedious at some parts and once an enemy as seen you, you get a hard time evading it.\n\nPROS:+Engaging story that keep you guessing until the very end.\n+Solid voice acting.\n+Music and sound adds to the dread of SOMA. Put some killer headphones and you're set! Don't forget to play in the dark too!\n+The atmosphere keeps you on your toes for the grand majority of the game.\n\nCONS:-Tedious enemies once encountered.\n-Pacing can be off at times while when you are trying to figure out what to do and where to go.\n-No worthy exploration besides just going from where you are told. While the Ocean floor is very well done, don't scatter too far since it is pointless. I'd say there is long distances between areas in the ocean floor so just run and you'll save time!\n\nOVERALL:This game is... wow. This game is amazing. I really hope we get to see more of SOMA since I was drawn to keep going until I see the big picture of "what the hell is going on here".\n\nRECOMMENDATION:Absolutely! Best game of Frictional Games to date and they keep getting better and better. If you loved Amnesia: The Dark Descent, you'll feel at home here! SOMA is as creepy as Amnesia except in a sci-fi setting. I hope this new IP expand so we could experience more of the new world these developers made for us.\n\nThere is a live-action fan made web series that I'm recommending highly as well.Here's the link of the First Episode:  SOMA Live-Action Video Series ~ Transmission #1\n\nRATING:9.0 / 10\n\nPS: The only spoiler I'll give was somewhat, a disappointment to me. It is the pre-alpha footage that was shown back in early 2013 and it featured a creepier tone. Sadly, the footage is NOT part of the game.

It does an excellent job at invoking emotional responses in the player that sync up very well with how the mian character must have felt.

HIGHLY recommended, if you enjoyed any of the atmosphere and story of Bioshock you will love this game.  I played it in Steam on my Mac with an Xbox 360 controller and had an absolute blast.  While the decisions you make in the game don't affect the outcome or story in any significant ways, they do have WEIGHT.  I agonized over a couple of decisions, like literally had to pause the game and think it through before I acted.  Some decisions came more easily, however as I progressed through the game and learned more about the situation I was in I came to regret them.\n\nThis game is a perfect blend of horror, sci-fi and storytelling.  The effects and technology really pull off the feeling of walking around on the bottom of the ocean floor.  There are some puzzle elements, but they are natural and intuitive.  There is zero combat.  You will encounter enemies you wish you could explode into a million screaming pieces, but your helplessness forces you to figure out a way past without resorting to brute force.  Very much a thinking man's game.\n\nI only experienced one bug in the game, and it's already been patched by the 1.0.1 version.  Frictional Games has been polishing this gem for 5 years and it shows.","September 27, 2015","true","24.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

READ AT YOUR OWN PERIL ].\n\nSOMA is the 5th game developed by Frictional Games,  and as a huge fan of Amnesia (and slightly less so Penumbra),  I was really looking forward to diving into this game.  Underwater settings are a huge selling point for me, and it looked like this one would be chalk full of atmosphere.\n\nI was not dissapointed.\n\nThe environments and ambience of the game immerse you in a dark, damp, world full of malfunctioning machines and abandoned sea labs.  It's visually stunning, and it sounds even better than it looks, with  constant creaking and rumbling that you could swear wasn't even coming from the game.  Headphones are a must!\n\nThere is also a rich story here, about a man with brain damage, an apocalypse, and a cancerous AI.  It is told to you through a combination of audio recordings, and audiovisual clues in the environment. (notepads, old TVs, etc.).  It does a good job of showing you *just* enough to keep you interested without telling you the whole story.\n\nBut then there's that burning question,  which all of us horror fans will be asking -  Is this a good horror game?  And the answer is : No.  No it is not. In fact, I would go as far as to say that Soma falls more in to the category of 'psychological thriller' , than horror.   For a number of reasons -\n\n1.  The enemies are more annoying than frightening.\n\nVisually, they look sort of disturbing.  But that's about it.  They have incredibly predictable AI patterns, and avoiding them is just a matter of exploiting their particular AI flaw.  Some monsters respond to sound, others to line of sight, etc.  They are a far cry from the truly horrific creatures we faced in the Dark Descent.\n\n2.  The voice acting is totally at odds with the situations your character finds himself in.\n\nYour chipper Canadian protagonist responds to mutilated bodies and biomechanical horrors with a casual "Gosh! What was that thing?"  It would sound more at home in an episode of Scooby Doo than a dark horror game.\n\n3.  The game heavily implies that your circumstances are imagined,  so the feeling of risk is out the window.\n\nAt multiple points throughout the game , your character will randomly teleport from place to place and suddenly find equipment he didn't know he had.  A horror experience relies on putting you in your character's shoes and creating a concern for his or her well being.  In SOMA, it is impossible to care about the fate of your character because you are all too aware that he may be simply experiencing a hallucination.  And yes, I am aware that this can be a horrifying situation if done correctly - see 'Layers of Fear' if you're looking for psychedelic horror of that nature.  Cuz this aint it.\n\n\nSo, with all of that being said,  is SOMA a good game?  Well .... yes, and no.   Can it create a compellling and atmospheric world and suck you into it ?  Yes.   Can it tell you a mind boggling story that will have you questioning what you see ?  Yes.   Does it have good gameplay?  Sort of.   Is it a good horror game?  Hell no.\n\nIf you are looking for an intriguing story in an atmospheric world,  SOMA will satisfy you.  If you want to be frightened, look elsewhere.\n\nGames like this really make me wish that Steam's review system had more options than "Yes" and "No"  :/","September 25, 2015","true","5.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It was fresh, exciting and so perfectly executed I couldn't be happier with the outcome. The game brings in all the quirks you'd expect from a Fritional Games production. The well knows interaction with the environment, the notes and slow unravelling story. You feel so intertwined with each and every person and thing your interact with in the game.\nThe game lacks a fundamental UI, theres no inventory screen and the such. This really adds to the immersion that the game provides. Aside from a few hints, and the typical hand gestures to show what you can do with an object, the screen is clutter free. The environments are expertly designed with little to no tears or glitches to break immersion. The game has sparse, if any glitches and its extremely well put together.\nI'd rate this game a 10/10 in all aspects!

I hadn't heard too much about this game when it released and I bought it expecting a similar experience to Penumbra/Amnesia. What I wasn't expecting was for it to be one of my favorite games I've ever played. SOMA is different from Frictional's previous titles in that it's not a horror game first and foremost. Yes, the atmosphere is very tense and the sound design is SUPERB which helps immerse this tense setting. And yes, there are moments that are truly terrifying, but the horror is created to accent the environment and the story rather than be the focus of the game.\n\nHonestly, this game floored me with its presentation. The atmosphere, the story, the characters, I was CAPTIVATED through and through. After the game was done, the moral dilemmas and the state of the world/characters left me thinking about what happened for weeks after I had finished. 2015 has been a big year for AAA titles and I think it'd be a shame for this game to go too under the radar.","November 29, 2015","true","8.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Meets the standards Frictional Games set for themselves in their heyday (Amnesia: The Dark Descent, and Penumbra)\n\nThe atmosphere oozes from each setting in the game. Audio is excellent and adds so much to the tension. Environment visuals are great, but I found character models slightly funny looking. I love that you can pick up and interact with so many objects in the world, unlike the Machine For Pigs walking simulator.\n\nScares and scary situations are plentiful. It's great that Frictional Games is able to scare you without always relying on darkness as a crutch. I found myself tense throughout a larger portion of the game than I remember for their previous titles. Definitely got an adrenaline rush a few times, and I had to take breaks in some of the areas.\n\nThe dialogue in general is entertaining, but at some points the main character's philosophical musings are too in-your-face and even repetitive. The overall story is pretty good, pieced together gradually as you progress through the game, including a lot of optional text and sound clips.\n\nThe pacing is excellent. The game is pretty linear, which was important to keeping the game's momentum going.\n\nConclusion: Must play, if you can stomach scary games.","December 1, 2015","true","11.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

In fact, Frictional Games took SOMA a big step further and challenge your thoughts and even your sanity at times, towards the big revelation of what are you and what do you do once all you knew is gone.\n\nSOMA is an exploration game, albeit some places are hard to explore since you can get chased down in some different section of the undersea PATHOS II base but you get the point!\n\nYou are Simon, waking up in the PATHOS II undersea base and, once you get your bearing and trying to figure out what is going on, you go on an important mission to save yourself from constant threats around many corners. I don't want to say too more and I want you, the gamer, to experience this game without reading too much about this game. Experience it yourself, at your own pace and process everything the game shows you till the very end.\n\nThe visuals, atmosphere, voice acting... all superb! The undersea floor is amazing. It's bringing the good vibes of BioShock when you were walking on the ocean floor.\n\nThe pacing can be tedious at some parts and once an enemy as seen you, you get a hard time evading it.\n\nPROS:+Engaging story that keep you guessing until the very end.\n+Solid voice acting.\n+Music and sound adds to the dread of SOMA. Put some killer headphones and you're set! Don't forget to play in the dark too!\n+The atmosphere keeps you on your toes for the grand majority of the game.\n\nCONS:-Tedious enemies once encountered.\n-Pacing can be off at times while when you are trying to figure out what to do and where to go.\n-No worthy exploration besides just going from where you are told. While the Ocean floor is very well done, don't scatter too far since it is pointless. I'd say there is long distances between areas in the ocean floor so just run and you'll save time!\n\nOVERALL:This game is... wow. This game is amazing. I really hope we get to see more of SOMA since I was drawn to keep going until I see the big picture of "what the hell is going on here".\n\nRECOMMENDATION:Absolutely! Best game of Frictional Games to date and they keep getting better and better. If you loved Amnesia: The Dark Descent, you'll feel at home here! SOMA is as creepy as Amnesia except in a sci-fi setting. I hope this new IP expand so we could experience more of the new world these developers made for us.\n\nThere is a live-action fan made web series that I'm recommending highly as well.Here's the link of the First Episode:  SOMA Live-Action Video Series ~ Transmission #1\n\nRATING:9.0 / 10\n\nPS: The only spoiler I'll give was somewhat, a disappointment to me. It is the pre-alpha footage that was shown back in early 2013 and it featured a creepier tone. Sadly, the footage is NOT part of the game. Still, the game is fantastic and maybe this "removed parts" could be restored later via a DLC or in a sequel... who knows!\n\nSo here's the footage:  SOMA - Debut Gameplay Trailer","September 29, 2015","true","14.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Meets the standards Frictional Games set for themselves in their heyday (Amnesia: The Dark Descent, and Penumbra)\n\nThe atmosphere oozes from each setting in the game. Audio is excellent and adds so much to the tension. Environment visuals are great, but I found character models slightly funny looking. I love that you can pick up and interact with so many objects in the world, unlike the Machine For Pigs walking simulator.\n\nScares and scary situations are plentiful. It's great that Frictional Games is able to scare you without always relying on darkness as a crutch. I found myself tense throughout a larger portion of the game than I remember for their previous titles. Definitely got an adrenaline rush a few times, and I had to take breaks in some of the areas.\n\nThe dialogue in general is entertaining, but at some points the main character's philosophical musings are too in-your-face and even repetitive. The overall story is pretty good, pieced together gradually as you progress through the game, including a lot of optional text and sound clips.\n\nThe pacing is excellent. The game is pretty linear, which was important to keeping the game's momentum going.\n\nConclusion: Must play, if you can stomach scary games.","December 1, 2015","true","11.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I wasn't a fan of the Amnesia games. Do not get me wrong, they arn't bad and even made me jump here and there but I found myself not getting to grips with it very well. Perhaps its the lovecraftian feel, never been a fan of it myself...respect and appriciate it work's just won't go out of my way to read the literature. So I would play them, not purchase.\n\nSoma is something different. Unlike Frictional's previous installments there is no amnesia here, just a nasty shock for ANYONE put in that situation themselves. Throughout the cold, dark, atmospheric doomsday lab, the game makers make you trudge through a...cyberseapunk, gooped up nightmare. From slowly creeping through lonely halls, filled with half-crazed machines to "moonjumping" along the ocean floor, the mystery and tension the game builds kept me enthrawled from start to finish and im not afraid to admit one of the only games that has made me cry.\n\nThis is also being said quite by many people but i applaud Mikko Tarmia for his soundtrack, its heavily inspired by the old sci-fi synth soundtracks of the past, fans of Tangerine Dream and Biosphere should apply within. The voice acting isn't as amazing as many others make out, saying this however the lead rolls play there parts perfectly. It's more than forgivable hearing the odd flat emotioned tone every now and again (and no, i don't mean from the robots..infact, perhaps this was done on purpose, some of the robot counterparts sound ALOT more "alive" than their original human counterparts).\n\nAs with any game though, it is not without some bad points. Simon's reactions are sometimes, questionable (I also won't spoil the ending but you will wanna' slap him while also feeling VERY sorry for him... ). The enemy A.I. is also EXTREMLY easy to dodge and navigate around, infact I only ended up dieing on some of the "chase" sequences due to being an idiot at the time and not memorizing the route, so people expecting a challenge from the enemies will be saddly let down. Also the game has a brownish/grey washout effect to the ENTIRE screen, I would really recommend downloading the SweetFX graphics injection, it just makes everything a little more in focus and colourfull (when you come to looking round in the ocean you'll thank them).\n\nIn closing, I highly recommend this game. Fans of psychological mind-F!%"ery will love it, sci-fi fans will adore it, Amnesia fans....ehhh, will probably take it or leave it, I adore it and that is all.\n\nP.S. There is also an amazing short little mini-series that was made to promote the game called Soma: Transmission. Watch it on youtube. Good acting to be honest, great story, had some budget put behind it and... Imogen. Imogen is almost up there with Ripley, thank you Imagos and Frictional for Imogen if I have to say anything about both the game and series it is that. Thank you.\n\nAnd now a NEW ENTRY in at #9 on crash's top sci-fi movie quotes:\n\n"The weight of the sea... IT'S THE WEIGHT, OF THE SEEEEA!!

Suspensful and unexpectedly laden with ideas, concepts that are already of tremendous importance to me. It's no Crysis graphics-wise (and I'm fine with that anyway), but I thought it all very well designed and quite beautiful. I found myself playing with headphones on in the dark.

What an amazing game.\n\nYou'd be doing yourself a huge favour by going into the game as a blank slate. Just stay away from the internet, or walkthroughs or anything of the sort. Your whole experience will be worth it.\n\nDespite what the tags say, this isn't really a horror game. Sure there are parts that make your blood curdle and the game and the setting can be genuinely creepy. But what stood out for me in this game are the actual themes behind it. It really shakes you up psychologically, more so than other story-driven games, and it makes you reflect on yourself as a human being. The choices you make in the game have no consequences and don't alter the ending of the game in any way. But the choices stay with you. And I'm sure that the choices I made today are going to keep me awake at night. I'm not even a person who gets hugely attached to games. But I assure you, this one just draws you in.\n\nI just have one tip for you when you're playing this game:\nJust relax, take your time while you're playing through it and explore the world around you. Learn more about it and get immersed in it. It'll make your choices seem all the more "real".\n\nWhat are you waiting for?\nSeriously, play this game.

It had it's fair share of tense moments and creepy parts but not scary, though it was a million times better than Amnesia in a lot of different ways.\n\nThe biggest improvement for me was the lack of repetition and predictable game\level design. SOMA would keep every challenge different, as well as the approach to solve them. I won't go into details because it would spoil it. However I saw Amnesia 1\2 and a few other horror games as being boring because they would often use the same tricks over and over again, making it predictable, repetitive and not scary.\n\nThe story was very well crafted and nicely paced with some interesting characters. The main two characters are excellently voiced and have some interesting moments together.\n\nI felt there was a lot more they could have done with the game though. It gives you choices which don't seem to have any meaningful impact later in the game. Which is sad. It gives you the illusion the story could fork at different points but I saw nothing later that would suggest it did.","October 24, 2015","true","25.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This happened to me once or twice, the worst being from a known bug when first trying to enter lambda. Really took away from the experience, but luckily...\n\nHowever annoying that above was, I still highly recommend this game. The story is 10/10 - all my assumptions about the plot were wrong and I loved the game for it. There are some fantastic moments in the game, with the last third being some of the best. There is just not enough movies and games that deal with the abyss of the deep sea - I was truly inspired by how terrifying it would be to be lost down there. Moreover, the ideas presented make it a true scifi - moreso than what Hollywood calls scifi these days. Sci-fi asks questions and presents ideas in such a way that it should make you think long and hard about those ideas.\n\nAlso, the sound design must be praised, all the environment and ambient sounds were fantastic - constantly creating tension and a sense of unknown while giving life to every environment and stage within each chapter of the story.\n\nThis isn't a perfect game, but however occasionally frustating it is, this is a game that takes advantage of its medium - most games parody film in telling a story - this game shows how it can tell a story better than a film could.\n\n10/10 Catherine is from Taipei","April 9","true","15.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game doesn’t tell everything to the player, and mainly leaves the player to fill in the gaps that the story doesn’t fill. I enjoyed this as most of games that Frictional Games has released do the same thing. The problem is that there isn’t much new in terms of actual gameplay. Yes some things DO change, but most of it all carries over from Penumbra and Amnesia, and (at some points) feels too similar to them gameplay wise.\n\nThis doesn’t mean the game didn’t do anything differently. For example, voices! Voice has always been a stumbling point for Frictional Games, often enough being seldom seen if being included at all, but it’s inclusion here I feel was needed in order to deliver a believable world. While a few performances fall towards the ‘okay’ side, most of them were well done. The voices are convincing enough that it makes the player feel really bad in certain situations, and the only ‘okay’ voices are the ones that the player will only hear for a few minutes. All the main character(s) have very accurate and believable performances.\n\nOverall, the game is top notch. I won’t spoil the story, but the game is worth it on story alone. While the gameplay was okay, I pushed through the more ‘boring’ gameplay segments simply to get back on the story.

Iam big fan of Amnesia dont get me wrong but the story wasnt the greatest. Coming in with little expectations for SOMA i ended up being hugley surprised. With a nice little introduction the game sets a good pace for itself. But still leaves you and everything around you shrouded in mystery, Letting you imagine whats happening and whats going to happen around every corner only to change your ideas everytime you get the next part of the story. I dont want to give to much away if you cant tell. SOMA has beautiful graphics  and lots of interaction with the world around you. The atmosphere makes you peek around every corner before walking anywhere and had me turning around slowly alot but had the right amount of scares to keep you afraid but interested and keen to move on.\n\nI really enjoyed SOMA and highly recommend it to horror/story fans but even if your not a horror person SOMA is still worth checking out.

SOMA isn't perfect, but once the screen fades to black for the last time it makes up for any deficit. It sets an impossible standard for most indie developers.\n\nThis was not the game I was expecting. If, like me, you have only glimpsed some early build trailers, then the design has clearly changed. Placed underwater, amongst the remains of humanity, you must come to grips with almost a century of change, and ultimately redefine the term human. Talking robots, mechanized humans and corrupted marine life all play their role in convincing you that something has gone horribly wrong.\n\nFrictional maintain a number of elements from their previous outings, including physics based puzzles. Almost any object can be grabbed, dropped and thrown; levers can be pulled; wheels can be twisted; doors pulled or pushed open. The concept lends a welcome tactile nature to the story which, sadly, falls back on a familiar trope: your all alone, EXCEPT for a voice to guide you. While you identify the owner of the voice, and ultimately take on their objective as your own, it still feels like a commitment to revealing the story through environment and atmosphere would have strengthened the isolation, making searching out information a puzzle in itself.\n\nThe look and setting of SOMA will bring obvious comparisons to Bioshock, but it's tenuous link at best. Skulking through the confined, industrialized corridors of Pathos II feels far removed from the Art Deco inspired, living spaces afforded to Rapture. No guns and plasmids, only exploring and hiding.\n\nWorth a special mention is the sound design, music and voice acting. Certain games lend themselves to headphones more than others, and you would be doing a disservice not to use them in this case. The effect is universally excellent in creating a sense of place, whether the groan of stressed metal or the muted, calm of the seafloor.\n\nPrevious Frictional releases have relied on enemies to provide constant tension and scares, leaving you cowering in darkened corners. SOMA's mechanized enemies don't appear as frequently, and tend to be solo when they do, but I personally found them to be frustrating. My main issue was their completely random nature. In one example I was left with the enemy blocking my only way forward, unresponsive to sound or light, and refusing to budge until I ran at it, died and restarted past that point. While they are fitting to the story and environment, I couldn't help but feel they may not have been necessary, and instead the developer felt pressured to include them.\n\nThere are some other issues, I experienced, that may or may not concern others. Loading times are looooong (up there with The Witcher 3), with intermittent loading occuring at strange intervals. Pacing is slower in the first half than the more compelling second. Objectives are not marked which leads to wandering and backtracking trying to find items and puzzles to solve.\n\nThe best test of the success of an idea is how it stays with you afterward. Like Life Is Strange, SOMA has remained with me since finishing, debating the choices I made and trying to reconcile the events into chronological order. It's Frictional's best story yet, offering a rich message that never takes away from the terror of playing. In fact, that message questioning what it means to be human, is SOMA's most terrifying element. The game isn't perfect, none are, but if an amazing story, wrapped in an absorbing atmosphere and sprinkled with puzzles is your thing, then it's an easy choice.","October 4, 2015","true","2.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","2"

This happened to me once or twice, the worst being from a known bug when first trying to enter lambda. Really took away from the experience, but luckily...\n\nHowever annoying that above was, I still highly recommend this game. The story is 10/10 - all my assumptions about the plot were wrong and I loved the game for it. There are some fantastic moments in the game, with the last third being some of the best. There is just not enough movies and games that deal with the abyss of the deep sea - I was truly inspired by how terrifying it would be to be lost down there. Moreover, the ideas presented make it a true scifi - moreso than what Hollywood calls scifi these days. Sci-fi asks questions and presents ideas in such a way that it should make you think long and hard about those ideas.\n\nAlso, the sound design must be praised, all the environment and ambient sounds were fantastic - constantly creating tension and a sense of unknown while giving life to every environment and stage within each chapter of the story.\n\nThis isn't a perfect game, but however occasionally frustating it is, this is a game that takes advantage of its medium - most games parody film in telling a story - this game shows how it can tell a story better than a film could.\n\n10/10 Catherine is from Taipei","April 9","true","15.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game is pretty linear, with the exception of a few interweaving corridors scattered throughout where you sneak around the unsavoury beasts that lurk in this eerie and atmospheric tale. If you’re not familiar with the Developer’s past titles, that’s fine: narratively speaking it is a solo story and not connected to anything they’ve done before. I found the plot intriguing and very enjoyable. Not going to give anything away as I like to go into these sort of games with knowing little and coming away surprsied, but If I had to give you a hint of what to expect then... no, not going to tell you ^_^\n\nEnemies cannot be killed: you can run, hide, distract and avoid. There are a variety of non-inventory objects that you can pick up to throw to distract the creatures; this may aid in your escape and allow for misdirection so you can continue your progression throughout the game. If you get caught, you get one more chance to proceed near from where you left of, albeit injured and slower than before. You can heal yourself at points through the game, but if you get caught for the second time in a row then the game ends and you have to restart from the last checkpoint. Checkpoints and health are fairly frequent and I didn’t find the game altogether difficult / frustrating when compared to other games in the genre.\n\nThere is also a community Mod feature whereby you can play other people’s creations: to date there are few game mechanic changes and fully playable sections of horror. I can only hope the popularity of the mods increases over time.\n\nOverall the excellent story had me hooked , the tense sections of hide and seek, & the odd heart thumping chase sequence made this a very enjoyable outing. There perhaps isn’t much to bring the player back for a replay unless you are interested in diving back into the story. I’d give the game an 8/10","May 23","true","15.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

The only two things I knew about SOMA before booting it up were that it was made by Frictional Games, one of my favorite developers ever since the Penumbra Tech Demo, and that it had a science fiction theme.\n\nAfter having completed the game, I know so much more. I know SOMA has nothing to be ashamed of when compared with true classics like System Shock and Half-Life, or more recent greats such as Alien: Isolation. I know that even though the game isn't really very scary or even a horror game at all, there is a very real and definite sense of wonder, discovery and adventure.\n\nI know that while playing, you'll witness SOMA redefine itself in front of your eyes - Several times. The game plays with your expectations in a way that I found wholly captivating, and the intriguing storyline with grand scifi concepts creates a real drive forwards to get into the bottom of the mystery.\n\nI know that there's no real shooting in the game, and the pace is mostly dictated by environmental puzzles and logbook musings. I know that the graphics are vastly improved from Frictional's previous efforts, and that the sound design is sublime.\n\nBut most importantly, I know I shouldn't say anything more. I hope someone else can also dive into SOMA as fresh as I was able to. This is the best game Frictional have ever done, and most probably the best game of 2015.","September 23, 2015","true","11.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

EDIT:\nI mentioned previously that lighting weasn't especially dynamic. After replacing my aging GTX650 with a new 970, I will retract that statement.\nThe scenery was creatively designed, believable, and always contributes to the experience, contrasting claustrophobic malfunctioning underwater habitats with exposed agoraphobic seabeds, with the nightmarish pitch-black hadal depths and their associated crude, heavy-duty habitats. Where games like Bioshock used this environment to create a slightly more fun and kitschy atmosphere, SOMA uses it to create something that is extremely desolate and unnerving, while managing to keep things shaken up enough to keep from becoming too repetitious.\n\nI'm going to talk about the story some now, so if you're going to consider playing for the game's narrative and literary value, then you may want to turn back.\n\n\n\n\nThe game delves heavily into existentialism, in what I think to be a relatively unique fashion. THe concept of using a natural biological intelligence as the prototype for an artificial intelligence is one that has gained some traction in recent years, with IBM revealing their new computer just months ago designed to process information much in the same way that a human brain does.\nAmong the high-minded stuff in the game comes the question of how much of a human being you can remove and replace, and have it still be the same person. The Theseus discussion, as has been approached by cyberpunk fiction for decades now. Nothing truly revolutionary there, except when the game approaches the idea of simulacra, duplication of brains and personalities.\nYou kill a couple of people in the game, including yourself, twice. Other games have you murdering droves of enemies with guns, never once permitting you to question why or whether or not it was necessary. In Soma, the story takes place after the end of the world, after the last survivors of a comet impact managed to wait out the end of humanity in a large underwater complex. SHortly before you discover that you are neither whom nor what you believe yourself to be, you begin to encounter machines who communicate,  question, optimistically ask for assistance. ANd then you switch them off. It starts to get more and more difficult the more human they become, until you finally realize what's going on. YOur personality was duplicated a hundred years ago in an attempt to cure you of a traumatic brain injury, but later it found itself being used as a template for artificial intelligence development, hence your waking up inside of the mechanized corpse of an oceanographer one hundred years later, at which point the game deposits the question on your lap, were those machines any different from you? And does that change your response to whether or not to let them die?\n\nThe scenes you encounter become more and more emotionally and philosophically complicated, but the game won't beat you up for it. You might find yourself doing a good enough job of that, though, if you let yourself get immersed.\n\n\nI highly recommend this game for fans of the horror genre, and anyone looking for a good, powerful narrative with a lot of highbrow concepts addressed therein.","September 27, 2015","true","25.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The sound is to experience with headphones, awesome work on that too.\n\nThe gameplay is smart and simple, I love this great idea seen in DOOM3 that gives you the control of the mouse in the computer you are accessing in the game.

Everything is immersing you ( literally ) deeper and deeper in the story, the characters, consciousness...\n\nThe main asset of SOMA is it's scenario.

Ever since we first heard about the game since it was announced in 2012 (I think) everyone has been hyped. The question is, did it live up to the hype and more importantly, is it up there with Amnesia: TDD? I'll try my best not to constantly compare the two, but it's hard not to.\n\nTo start off, SOMA is an incredible game. The atmosphere and story is very immersive and the sound design is superb. Everytime I walked down a corridor, I felt alone and terrified, as if I was the protaganist. SOMA pulls this off brilliantly. The feeling of isolation in a setting of nightmares is extremely unsettling, and after finishing a session of SOMA, it took me a while to get back to the real world.\n\nYou're always kept on your toes while playing SOMA. There is never a moment when you are not apprehending a jump scare. There a few "jump scares", but the ones that do exist are well executed. As many of you know, a lot of the gameplay in SOMA forces you to run and hide rather than confront any enemies, as seen in the predecessor games. While this can be terrifying at times, I began to find the monster encounters to be very similar and a little stale. It's a case of hiding, staring at the ground and shuffling past them before they notice you. While one could argue that not being able to actually look at the monsters adds a level of terror to the game in the sense of "You always fear what you don't understand" a lot of the time I did want to have a good look at the monsters, because I wanted to understand them. It's difficult to argue this point because it is an effective mechanic and it does make the game a bit more terrifying I suppose. I just thought the monster encounters were all very similar. The fact that the monsters don't despawn and simply patrol, sometimes made the gameplay become repetitive. On the other hand, many could argue that this is a better mechanic than having the monsters disappear, because it keeps your heart racing.\n\nSOMA is very story driven, and it makes the gameplay much more interesting. I spent a lot of time simply opening lockers and staring at pictures on the wall. I wanted to soke up every detail in regards to the story, which is a fantastic thing because I did this much less in Amnesia: TDD because the story wasn't as engaging. I've heard a lot of people saying that it is simply a walking simulator, and it kinda is, but I think this term is exaggerated in regards to SOMA. Yes, you will do a lot of walking, but I think this term can be discarded. I'd like to mention again, that the atmosphere is always unsettling, and quite frankly, the simple act of walking is one of the most unsettling parts to the game. Probably the most terrifying section of the game was while I was simply walking through caves on the sea floor. I won't spoil it, but it certainly was, in my personal opinion, the most terrifying section of the entire game.\n\nThe puzzles in SOMA seem a bit more interesting and engaging when compared to both Amnesia games. They are actually quite simple and logic based, but will sometimes make you ponder. I must admit that I had to use a guide during one puzzle, because I was completely stucky. To some gamers, the puzzles may become a bit annoying if you come with a rushed mindset.\n\nSOMA is a great game in terms of story and atmospheric immersion. SOMA will leave you questioning things even after you finished it. It's not often that games have the ability to do this and I commend FG on their work. On the horror side, I sometimes felt that the scares weren't great. For example, you'll often find that all the lights will shut off and a monster will roar, making its presence known, which is a bit cliche. On the other hand, some encounters were truly terrifying and at one time I just wanted to close my eyes and not look. Most of the scares, in my opinion, simply came from the isolation and aloneness. I was always apprehensive when opening a door because I thought it would be a chance for a cheap jump scare. Luckily, this rarely happens which makes the suspense even greater.\n\nFor fans of Amnesia and Penumbra games, or horror games in general, I would highly recommend this game. The interesting story and always unsettling atmosphere makes this game a great horror experience.","September 24, 2015","true","12.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

That's not to say you're going to get bored of those moments, but you're not going to end up hinding behind your chair gnawing you nails out. Personally I didn't really feel moved by the moral diliemas placed in front of the player - but mainly as I already have my views reasnably decided in this area. Would I did like however is that the choices were completely risk free for the player. As in, you're not going to be stuffed and miss some amazing part of the game if you make the wrong decision. The decisions are there to make the player think about moral issues, not force a moral view upon the player. I really liked this, as I felt I questioned my own views in such situations, rather than thinking 'damn I wanted that trophy!' The story is well written and compels the player to move on well. Its not going to win any awards for the most amazing script of all time, but is compelling and I enjoyed the little twist mid way through. The setting is very nice and I found the world an enjoyalble unerving world to be in. I especially loved searching for clues about the world, reading journals and scraps of paper in draws. I felt like I was there, literally searching to find out what the hell had happened to this world. Gameplay is solid, and I loved the first person perspective for a non-combat orientated story driven title. I hadn't played any games by this devloper before, but I certainly will look more into them after this installment. I certainly think the game is very reasnably priced and worth the money. Overall, its a title that I really enjoyed - and I will have a similar relationship as to one of my favourite books. Picking it up again every 6 months or so as I enjoy stepping into the world. Worth a visit.","September 27, 2015","true","10.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Playing through this game, I've found myself feeling less scared of the game world, but more intrigued. While the game definitely has it's scary moment, mainly when the monsters see you, it's also got a fantasically in-depth and interesting story.\n\nThe scary portion of the game comes from the wonderfully designed atmosphere, and the sound design. The sound design is amazing. The music, the footsteps of monsters, the creaking of the enviroment, all contribute to create an intense atmosphere. I must say, in comparison to Amnesia, Frictional Games has stepped up their game.\n\nThe story is extremely interesting with twists and turns that keep you wanting to play to the end. While the ending of the game is lacking some closure for one or two of the characters, I feel that they (Frictional Games) wanted it to end like that. It makes you think and reflect on the game and what it means to be human.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good story, intense gameplay, and are fans of the Amnesia/Penumbra games. Even if you're not a fan of their previous titles, this game stands out on it's own.\n\n9/10\nLeft me thinking about humanity.","September 27, 2015","true","10.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Overall I liked this game, but I don't see myself replaying it over and over like with Amnesia titles.\n\nThe Ai has improved very much since Amnesia but it's still overly stupid yet sometimes too smart. For example sometimes enemies can't see you whilst you're behind the chair, yet on other occasions they will chase you down no matter how many turns you took and that you're very far out of sight. Dying and limping for half an hour being stuck on a puzzle is not very amusing either, especially if you're being chased while at it. I think there should be some health regen - even 10% a minute would be great.\n\nNot having a journal or at least a proper inventory like in dark descent is really frustrating. At times you have no idea what to do and what the items you picked up are. Quite often the puzzles are also frustrating. The one where you had to put in a number of modules to get information out of the scientist was really frustrating having to try and try over and over again. Or the one where you had to change the antenna to call in transport. Still the puzzles are more entertaining than the ones in Machine for pigs.\n\nThe maps are designed pretty well but most of them look very much alike and nothing really stands out. I guess you can't make a big variety having to make tunnels all the time.\n\nOverall I think that plot and gameplay wise it's far behind the dark descent and far behind machine for pigs in plot and its trully beautiful maps. Don't regret buying it, but I expected a lot more.\n\n\n","September 23, 2015","true","9.2"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pxabstraction/recommended/282140/","pxabstraction","Parallax Abstraction","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pxabstraction/","985 products in account","The unabridged review with an audio reading can also be found here[wp.me].\n\nMy dislike of anything horror is well documented but it always makes for some interesting fundraising stretch goals for my yearly Extra Life campaigns. I like these because they not only help me raise more money, they force me to step outside my comfort zone which I think we all as gamers should do once in a while. In 2012, such a goal forced me to play through Frictional Games' last nightmare factory, Amnesia: The Dark Descent. It was terrifying without a doubt but I actually found the whole package lacking compared to many. SOMA, their latest effort, shifts from a Lovecraft-ian nightmare to a sci-fi one, with a high-minded story that asks many philosophical and moral questions about the nature of human consciousness, identity and what happens when those get thrown into unexpected states of flux. This story is what makes up for the fact that there isn't much actual game to be found.\n\nFrictional's horror formula is well worn. The core concepts are that you can't fight enemies, you can only run and hide from them, staring at them for too long inhibits your character's abilities and you can interact with many objects in the environment, though only a few are critical. They've stuck to this method for every game they've made and while it's admirable for how unconventional it is compared to mainstream titles, it's also getting old. It made more sense in Amnesia: The Dark Descent than it does in SOMA, where it really feels like they shoehorned these mechanics in because they already had tech for them and didn't know how to mix things up. It's not that they don't work, it's just that it feels very familiar and some more variety would have been nice. Suffice is to say, if you've played Frictional titles before, you'll know how everything works going in.\n\nEven with these mechanics, there isn't a lot in the way of what is traditionally considered game play in SOMA. Really, it fits more closely in with what has been become known as the narrative exploration genre, often referred to by its detractors as "walking simulators." Experiencing the world and the story is the first and foremost priority of this genre and while there may be mechanics, they're often few and limited. The two biggest draws for me in games are mechanics and immersive worlds so this type of game can definitely appeal to me but very few do. I've slammed on walking simulators before and had many passionate arguments about them. I'm not one of those people who will say they aren't games, I believe they are. However, I have very high standards for them because to me, making one is saying they you believe your story and writing to be so incredible that they don't need good mechanics to back them up. Most of the big name exploration games have simply not been able to live up to this in my opinion and I think many of the critical darlings were so not because of the games themselves but because of who was making them and the subjects they often ham-fistedly tackled.\n\nSOMA is one of the few narrative exploration games I've played where there story and delivery of it backed up the fact that you don't actually do very much besides move from place to place, avoid the occasional enemy and solve the occasional basic puzzle. I hated Gone Home because it's story was cliché, solitary, linear, hurried and so predictable, you know the core of it very quickly after you started playing. Even if you're thorough, Gone Home can be beaten in less than 2 hours. SOMA takes at least 8, not because it's padded--though it is a bit in places--but because it takes its time.\n\nYou're thrown many twists and curve balls that will keep you guessing and surprised right up until past the credits but there are also long periods where it lets the pressure off and encourages you to take in the environment or to get some discussion based exposition with other characters. They give you a lot to think about and it's clear the designers wanted you to have the time to think while you played, not just after you've stopped. There are several points where you're presented with a choice to make and while these unfortunately have no impact on how things turn out in the end, they also feel like they weren't put there for that purpose but to actually make you question your own moral compass before and after you made them. They exist not to service game play but just to make you think. For me, few games can pull this off the way SOMA did. There were several times I thought I know what the story was about and where it was going and every time, I was completely wrong. It's an achievement that SOMA was able to continually pull this off for over 8 hours, even if at the end, there are a couple of sub plots that begin and end quickly and aren't fully explained.\n\nOf course, a good story heavy game needs a fantastic environment to tell it in and SOMA delivers here as well. Things are dark, cold and depressing but in that metallic sci-fi way that I find more interesting than endless stone corridors like in Amnesia: The Dark Descent. Not having to rely on historical designs allowed Frictional to be more creative with their uses of colour and materials. The world of SOMA is a depressing one to be sure--especially as you start to learn what's happening outside of it--but it also has a vibrancy and variety that made it much more interesting for me. It's not a nice place to be but it's a very interesting place to be. This is complemented by generally very good voice acting. I would say the main protagonist is the weakest of the lot but not by much.\n\nFrom a technical end, SOMA is pretty good but has some issues. Frictional Games uses their own engine and it's not super well optimised. While it looks very nice for an indie title, it doesn't look AAA, yet ran like it was, often having a hard time maintaining 60 frames per second on my PC which is miles above the recommended specs. In their latest engine, they did manage to remove Amnesia's many loading screens but SOMA stutters badly when caching in a new level. I also had to restart the game because after a while, the frame rate plummeted and didn't recover. To be fair, I did play the entire thing in one session so that issue probably won't affect many. Still, I have AAA games on my system that look better and run better.\n\nI made SOMA my Extra Life 2015 stretch goal expecting it to be another terrifying horror game in a sci-fi setting. What I got was only occasionally terrifying but also the kind of deep, thoughtful, high-minded story you don't see in almost any mainstream games and which many indie games try and usually fail to realise. SOMA made me really sit back and think in a way only a handful of games ever have and I continued to for days after I finished it. The experience will stick with me for a long time and for much as I love this medium, I can't say that about many titles.\n\nIf you're looking for deep, dark storytelling and immersion, don't get hung up on SOMA's horror pretensions and give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised and you might be too. I can certainly say that I won't be immediately writing off future Frictional Games titles just because they're marketed as horror. That's something I never thought I'd say.","December 11, 2015","true","9.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Got a few flaws, problems with the way some opponents are handled throughout the game, but only merely a problem at all. The strengh of this game is its theme, the story and the way it is told to the player. SOMA gracefully walks through major sci fi plots, nailing the writing at multiple times, and brings wonderful discourses on... things I shouldn't talk about. It would spoil :)\n\nThe game itself isn't much of a challenge, this is mainly a sci fi story that you walk along with in a 3D world. Sometimes you will face opposition, but it's not enough to think of it as a "challenge". It's not even the core gameplay. Also the game is kinda scary, stressing really, and often gruesome, but not in excess I believe.\n\nI can't say I'm proud that I've beat the game (nothing to be proud of :) ) but I most certainly loved the journey.","January 10","true","8.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While the mechanics were lacking, and other games had done the theme better(atmospheric horror) The STORY is what kept you playing. The journey of Simon as he attempts to save humanity. Just when you think videogames are running out of plot, or good ideas and framework, or just a good story, SOMA actually delievers.\n\nIf i had to Rate it, 8/10 The story is worth knowing, it makes you think.

It's a little more story focused, and there's definitely lighter gameplay mechanics (no inventory management or lamp fuel / flashlight batteries), but I wasn't annoyed because there was still enough stuff for me to DO in the game.\n\nYou'll trek from one end of a facility to the other in search of some sci-fi macguffin all the while sneaking around a monster that will do unspeakable things to you. Every monster was great in its own way, mostly due to Frictional's best sound design to date. They all have a certain caveat to them that makes each encounter fun. I've heard some complaints about the monster AI being bad,  but I guess I played in a way that didn't reveal their flaws as much.\n\nSOMA paces itself a little more than The Dark Descent, with peaks of horror and valleys of exploration and story exposition. The story and setting is ridiculously 70s/80s sci-fi, it's great. One of the things about the story... you know "meaningful choices"? That buzzword that companies like BioWare and Telltale like to use? SOMA is the only game that I've played that actually has them.\n\nYou are put in situations where you must make choices through actual gameplay, not conversation options. The game never judges you for them, it doesn't really care what you do. It only asks "how do you feel about yourself?" There are very few "correct" choices and there was never a choice that I made that I didn't feel conflicted about.\n\nSOMA is really good. And, I would recommend it to any fan of science fiction.","October 25, 2015","true","10.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You play as Simon throughout the game, who not only brings up some very interesting speculations and perspectives on life, but also brings us a sort of humanity in a otherwise dark and murderous world.\nThe character design is very smoothly done and I often caught myself speculating about something Simon said - my thoughts would run off to a wild track very often, into speculations entirely different to the game.\nThough the sound design and ambience is very well done, there are some things about the visuals that bother me\n- such as the map design. You can and will find minor map glitches/imperfections in the maps, which can in some cases ruin the immersion.\nSome of the special things about this game, is how open it is to modding. The game has some extremely open source files that, does not only allow players to mod it, but also to find some very interesting files in there - I highly suggest you take a look in the game directory some time..\n\nThe ending is not very perfectly executed though, the way it's performed makes the game seem very unfinished/rushed to me, which frustrates me a lot. The ending leaves a pretty bad impression on the game and I think they could have redesigned it, or at least given it some more thought.\n\nBefore I take off here, I quickly want to mention the stability - I crashed an unbelieveble amount of times during my gameplay, just on one day, I crashed over 12 times.

If you like the horror gameplay of Alien Isolation or Amnesia, this will definitely be up your alley. It has a great story, excellent voice acting, beautiful graphics and wonderful sound.\n\nI don't have too many complaints. Maybe two. There monsters aren't perfect. In Alien Isolation the gameplay interaction with the Alien was perfect. You could hide under desks, inside cabinets, etc. and its AI was predictable in that the AI pulled off the Alien behavior perfectly. In SOMA this is none existent. There were times too where my interaction with the monsters didn't make sense. For example I managed to lure a monster inside a room that I could "hard lock." In other words not even I could open it and yet the monster somehow spawned outside of the room.\n\nThrowing objects to lure a monster away from an entrance it is blocking sometimes does nothing. In fact the monsters in the game often spend too much time lurking in areas that I need to get past making it incredibly difficult to progress.\n\nBy far the monsters are the clunkiest thing in the game and having come from Alien Isolation, I wish the AI was a little better. Fortunately the AI isn't terrible, it's just not great and it does work sometimes.\n\n","March 16","true","13.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In true form, the prose is brave, deep and wholehearted, with a hard veer towards real-life situations, personal conflict and philosophical tragedies. We've all got somewhere to be, games to do, so I'll try to keep it simple.\n\nSOMA stands out for a lot of reasons; namely we have a protagonist who we can empathise with. A lot of people are conflicted about Simon, but I think given the situation that he's in, we can forgive his bouts of vulnerability, fear and black humour. We also gain a valuable companion in the game who offers generous insights not only into the situation that Simon has been casually tossed into, but also about the nature of human beings, what defines them and our relationship with each other. (Which is really as simply as I can put it.)\n\nDespite all of these things, SOMA truly commits to the sense of isolation within a hostile and dark environment, relying on telltale signs dotted across all levels. (Mr. Akers, anyone?) Amnesia and Penumbra may have has this too, but SOMA uses it to its advantage.\n\nWith its deep storytelling, talented actors, intense horror, astounding graphics and elegant gameplay, SOMA is a treat for every gamer and a delight for horror fans everywhere.","March 18","true","23.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Frictional Games is best known for 3 things so I'll rank these here: Horror, Puzzles, and Story.\n\n8/10 Horror\n\nNot the scariest game ever, but it had very unique ways of building atmosphere and tension and it could scare you in unique ways other than simple jump scares; certainly a unique horror game in terms of its mechanics and story.\n\n5/10 Puzzles\n\nPuzzles weren't challenging, and despite being able to pick up everything, you will almost always know what objects are useless to you, and which ones will help you complete a puzzle.\n\n11/10 Story\n\nThis game is not only an amazing narrative, but a thought experiment about what it means to be alive, and what it means to be conscious. Many philosophical and ethical issues are presented in the game in interactive ways that really get you to think about your actions.\n\nThe story is very subtle and easy to miss as it is not shoved in your face. Story is delivered mostly in the form of written notes scattered about, emails on computers, and "memories" stored in corpses. There are many interconnected story lines involving many different characters; they are gradually revealed as you progress in the game. All of them culminate to deliver an absolutely amazing ending.","November 4, 2015","true","16.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I can tell you that this game is worth every penny and cent for many reasons.\n\nOne being that the whole atmosphere of the game was just phenomenoly intense and creepy, along with the music that just made it more mysterious. Another being that the storyline was absolutely beautiful, through the game I actually thought really hard about what was going to happen and made my own theories until the end. It made you think, PERIOD. Another is that the combonation with the puzzles that actually made the game challenging. I think that overal this is a good horror game for the ages.\n\nBUY THIS GAME, IT'S GR8. :D\n","October 20, 2015","true","15.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not about the game itself ,but  the impact of what happened at the end.\n\nI would say Soma is more than a game, and more of an experience everyone should play though. "What it means to be human " is more than just a tagline after you finish this game. In a way its very sad what happens to Simon, and yet there is  still Happiness as well.\n\nFor the game itself: I would say Soma is def. a must play. The sounds,  the story you learn about piece by piece, everything culminates into a very real experience that you just dont get alot of  in games today.\n\nSimon is a great character and the dialouge between him and Catherine is exceptional.  Sometimes i felt relieved when i got to talk with  Catherine again, to know that i'm not the only one  down here in this forsaken place.\n\nI  cannot do scary games, let me just say that. I played Amnesia the dark descent but had to stop before i knew it was going to get scarier. Soma is just the right mix. There were one or two times where I had to just pause the game. It was so intense! I frequently got goosebumps when i played this game. It was a thrilling experience nonetheless.\n\nHighly reccommend and would advise players to take there time when playing\n\n-Flash\n\n","October 20, 2015","true","18.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's their first game after Amnesia: The Dark Descent.\n\nThe game follows survival horror tropes, and as like Amnesia, you can't fight your enemies. Encounters with enemies are based on a system in which you have to turn off lights, hide in closets etc.\n\nSo if you're looking for an experience akin to Dead Space / Bioshock this will not be your thing. If you're looking for experiences similiar to Penumbra, Amnesia or Outlast this will be your thing.\n\nCompared to the previous games mentioned Soma is very slow. The story progresses slowly and the overall the scares are built with time. There is some shock value also, but not nearly to the extent of something like Outlast. (That's a good thing)\n\nThe story of this game is something I've never seen in a video game. It's a weird mix of The Matrix and Ex Machina, but it totally works in the context of the game. They clearly went all out.\n\nOverall I would recommend Soma to anyone who is interested in slow horror like Amnesia. It's a good follow up from Frictional Games and deserves your money. It's not a full priced game even, which is great.","October 24, 2015","true","23.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

SOMA is an incredible experience !\n\nThe complex story with unexpected turns of situations and how it will affect you associated to an amazing underwater atmosphere is enough to recommend this game !\n\nSo okay, it's not really horror though some part made me jump and there some really messed up gloomy stuff, there aren't many monsters (they don't have all an original scary look though creeepy they are) and they're not very bright either AND most if not every objects are useless, lots of useless places... but don't let that turn you down because you'd be missing out on the great experience this game can offer :)\n\nSOMA is a great experience for it's graphism, for the way it tells you the story, for it's atmosphere and the too rare setting it puts you in. Underwater based game aren't really legion and this well done even less (lighting and effects will definitely immerse you).\n\nIt's the kind of game I'd love to do again if they ever updated for the oculus rift when it will come out! =)\n\nSo, don't listen to all the hatred on the reviews, they might complain comparing it to Amnesia and such, stupid puzzles, not much horror, stupid monsters (some are totally blind, you can avoid another by not looking at it, ...) but I don't think those people really enjoyed the game for what it is... A creepy really well told story in an amazing world !\n\nIn the end, it was totally worth paying it at full price but if you're looking for a game that will chill you to the bones with plenty of horrible monsters then you might want to skip this one.\nIf you hate hide and seek games with monsters and prefer to defend yourself with heavy weapons, then again, skip this game ! It's not what it is.\nIf you do not like to take your time with a game and explore every useless place to read notes or just look at the decoration of a room, then skip this game, you won't enjoy SOMA if you just run straight to the next objective.\n\nSOMA is a game with a creepy story you will play for it's atmosphere, the game doesn't have any replayability whatsoever exept if you want to learn speedrun it...

Here are my thoughts. :)\n\nI think my point of view may be unpopular with this title(even though I recommend it) because I really enjoyed SOMA a lot more than the previous games produced by Frictional. I still enjoyed A:DD and A:MFP in their own way, but I was never able to complete them since I stubbornly refuse the guidance of a walkthrough. :P\n\nThat being said, this is a game that I enjoy more with each new playthrough so far. I find new things and notice different nuances in the dialogue that I previously hadn't. I didn't encounter any bugs on either playthrough and found the performance to be pretty good on my mid-tier rig with high settings.\n\nThe story was amazing for me as it took me down a path that I hadn't travelled before which in turn had me exploring thoughts that I hadn't had before. Though to be honest, the main character(Simon) struggled a bit more with some of the 'moral' choices he needed to make than I did. At times he would lament a choice so strongly that I would feel bad only because it made him sad. When you're in a survival situation, you don't always have the luxury of being able to keep everybody happy unfortunately.\n\nAnywho, I recommend this game for multiple playthroughs. If you're a fan of spooky exploration and an interesting story, this is a game for you.  If you have a problem with games where you don't get instant gratification or you race through games ignoring all the important plot points, this is NOT the game for you.","February 14","true","18.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Just wow.\n\nDefinitely one of the best storylines I've ever encountered in a videogame. Without giving too much away, the themes are very reminiscent of the Charles Stross novels Accelerando and Glasshouse (of which I am a huge fan).\n\nFar from simply another sci-fi survival horror game, this is a challenge that uses the platform of gaming itself against the player to create confusion and tension throughout. Cerebral is a good word to describe the overall experience.\n\nThere are quite a bit of jump scares, but the overall horror is generated in the concepts of identity, the mind, uncertainty, and the potential of deathlessness. If you are a high IQ type, you will get a kick out of all the symbolism (station names) and the post-modern meta-dominant motif.\n\nThe only part of this game that is really lacking is the gameplay. It is almost rail guided. There is not a lot of creativity in how the game is played, it is a closed world game. Not necessarily a bad thing, but the stick to it ness of the gameplay left me wanting a little bit more. It would be interesting to see the next title evolve into something a bit more open.\n\nAlthough primarily rail guided, be prepared to reference a walkthrough, you will get lost. I was unable to determine what items in the environment to interact with at times and this was a bit frustrating.\n\nThe immersive, disturbing storyline, sheer terror/freakiness of this game absolutely compensate for the limited frailties in the gameplay experience. Truly a gem in the survival horror genre.\n\n9/10, highly recommend","December 23, 2015","true","13.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I would put the scary-score on medium. Some monsters (like those towards the end) are really scary, others are just non-scary and annoying.\n- Really long loading times. I don't know if it is my computer, but it's not particularly fun to watch an almost black screen for 5 minutes every now and then\n- They kept it too simple. There is not even a real inventory this time and I wish that after all the negative feedback on Machine for Pigs feeling too much like a walking simulator, Frictional would step up the game and introduce more stuff/features for the game. This isn't like Machine for Pigs, but is not like Dark Descent or any old survival horror game either, it's more scaled down. For both better and worst.\n\nWith all that ♥♥♥♥ out of my chest, I think this is one of the best games 2015. The story, the way it is told is actually the most creepy part about SOMA. It is not a new theme in sci-fi ("What is consciousness?") but the way it is told while you are pushing through this dark adventure, it  explores every aspect of this kind of story and results in becoming an eerie tale filled with much ambiguity. Second, the atmosphere and the setting is crazy - SOMA definetly does underwater way better than Bioshock. The intro of the game also helps to give it a bizarre Alice in Wonderland-feeling, with you wondering how deep the rabbit hole really is. Gameplay is... okay. It's still just the normal hide-n-seek horror with nothing new added to it. But it is generally well-designed, though sometimes during dangerous situations it is not always 100% clear on what you are supposed to do. But I got a few scares and I had fun during most of the game. I definetly recommend this game for any horror-fan and also sci-fi-fans.","October 3, 2015","true","13.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Designed by Frictional Games (the creators of Amnesia), it truly stands out as a masterpiece in the stealth/survival horror genre.\n\nThe story was well crafted and the creators did a great job of landing it at the end to the point where I felt unsettled by it and the choices I made well after I had beaten the game.  The sound effects were also superb!  I was more unsettled by the things I heard than what I actually saw, many times.  That, along with the fascinating setting (think Bioshock meets Amnesia), really made for an atmospheric and immersive experience!\n\nMy only qualm was that the voice acting came off a little flat.  The inflections in the characters voices just did not convey the true horror of what was happening around them and came off as very matter of fact.  As if seeming to compensate for this, the main character would fill the silence during certain scenes by getting very long winded and philisophical about pivotal moments during the game's story.  As if the creators of the game did not fully trust that players would be able to pick up on those elements themselves.\n\nWith the exception of the voice acting (which wasn't terrible - just not great), it was an excellent game and well worth playing!","October 3, 2015","true","21.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Unlike a movie or a book though you are not a passive receiver of the story but rather active. SOMA also manages too feel like a book without any explicit need too stop the experience through save stations or such things, just play for a while, immerse yourself as much as you like and stop when ever you want or need too.\n\nSOMA manages to deliver both on story and feeling as well as touch on some rather deep philosophical questions about the self and what it means to exist. Being a fan of both Horror and sci-fi combined with a like for philosophical ideas made this game almost ridiculously tailored to things I like so i might be somewhat bias, but to me SOMA did not disappoint. The ideas presented in SOMA are some I've thought of myself from time to time, and SOMA is now a great excuse for me to talk to my friends about these concepts. To those not familiar with these ideas I urge you to play this game: It is likely blow your mind, and will lead to some interesting conversations.\n\nLike any great movie or any great book SOMA leaves you feeling a little different and with some strange new thoughts in your head.","October 3, 2015","true","14.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have been waiting for this game to be finished for YEARS and I am so glad it went above and beyond my expectations. I was impressed with the storyline and character development, I really felt for Catherine and Simon, and I found myself rooting for their survival throughout the game. Also the sense of immersion was incredible. The world while there are a few loopholes, is very immersive and well-done. It had a very Penumbra feel in regards to the storyline, but SOMA was far more upbeat. Rather than having a completely depressing outlook like Daniel in Amnesia where it's hard to find redemption, SOMA takes you to the lowest lows in regards to human survival and morality and gives you a very compelling shred of hope, and sense of awe when it comes to the wonders of being a human being. It also leaves you with some major philosophical questions in regards to, "what is a soul?" and "what defines human consciousness?" After beating the game I kind of just wanted to go lay in the grass somewhere, stare at some clouds and take a moment to say "Damn, it's great to be alive." Not many "horror" genre games make you think, and for that I think SOMA will take it's place on a pedestal as one of the best horror games out there. It's not just the scares, it's the overall experience that sells it.\n\nThe Gameplay: One of my biggest concerns was whether or not it would be like Frictional's other works and have only one or two enemies, but SOMA has loads of 'em, and some of them had me damn near peeing my pants. Really felt like they did some great improvements with the AI. As someone who's played hundreds of hours in Amnesia and custom stories, let me say that damn one of those last enemies really will NOT GET OFF YOUR ♥♥♥. Like you really have to be sneaky as all hell to get past these guys and I enjoy that challenge. Also makes the game very re-playable. The blur mechanic when you're close to enemies is pretty useful, but it can be annoying when you're trying to see. Mostly when your health is low, it's almost better to just kill yourself and re-do after a certain amount of blur. Otherwise, runs great, beautiful game. Minor lag on loading screens but very worth for the visual results.\n\nOverall: 10/10 loved it. Can't wait to see the mods.","September 25, 2015","true","34.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game will leave you reeling even after the credits - literally.  Play this game for the story, even if you dont like the hide and seek monster chase gameplay (there's mods to fix that too).  I hope you can take my word on this as talking about the story at all is to spoil it.\n\nThe only thing I can say against is that during the chase/monster sequences solving puzzles or finding that one item/thing to interact with is extreamly frustrating.  However in the end the pacing is almost perfect with high intense action sequences with downtime with exploration and world building.\n\n5/5 - Phenomenal.","January 7","true","8.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story is my favourite part of this game, which is really well presented and most of it isn't forced on you if you aren't really that interested or don't fully understand what's going on. Even a week or so after finishing the game I'm still thinking about it, and probably will do for a long time still. The more you understand the story, the better the game becomes. As for the horror, countless times this game has caused me to Alt-Tab for some time to build up my courage before playing again.\n\nThe GNU/Linux version works really well, though three or more times throughout playing the game crashed randomly without any obvious cause (remember the kill -9 [pid] terminal command if this does happen!).\n\nMinor spoilers below.\n\nThe monster encounters that you would expect from Amnesia: The Dark Descent don't happen straight away.

About 10 hours of gameplay is worth the pricetag. The game starts out at a slower pace and then really, really picks up in both puzzle-complexity and scary-ness. Most monsters have some sort of a counter, depending on their AI. It's actually possible to trick some of them into a room and then lock them away! Great ending. Make sure to stay after the end credits.\n\nThere are so many choices to be made in this game. The only real negative I can think of is that the choices don't really reflect anywhere in the game.

The answer is yes!\nPROS\nExcellent story, seriously. Very happy with the arcs and ending throughout. LOVED IT.\n\nExceptional voice acting. Loved the voice work for Catherine.\n\nVery creepy, unsettling atmosphere. Dread floods over you everytime you open a door.\n\nPuzzles were fun and cool to interact with. I found most to be rather easy, which is fine. But there were a few that stumped me for a little awhile. So if you're worried about how hard the game is, it's not that bad.\nCONS\nI might be in the miniority here, but my sytem excels the minimum requirements by a lot, and it auto set everything to "High." However, the game does feel poorly optimized, lots of frame drops, stutters, terrible screen tears, some lackluster graphics/textures. Did this hinder my experience? No, not really. I just to adjust a few settings here and there, but would have loved to see it more optimized.\n\nStealth mechanics could have been a lot better. Especially being that the game is primarily about dodging your foes and hiding from them. For example, you can't hide in lockers/closets/under table or desks. I'm sure there is a reason for this but just a small gripe I had. Overall it works and is probably about as good as Amensia: The Dark Descent's mechanics are.\nSCORE8.75/10\n\nQuick ConclusionSOMA was such a refreshing game. Sure, it esentially follows the same formula that Frictional games has always followed. But I found it to be much more rewarding. The story is incredible, I loved the twists they had on it and it has some very heavy moral issues throughout. You're not penalized for anything that you do, but I can't say that I don't feel guilty about some of the actions I did or had to do. And I'm sure you're all wondering...is it scary? Well, yes and no. I couldn't put this in the pros or cons because it's divided, and in a good way. The game is very unsettling, not overally gory, or filled with jumpscares. But the atmosphere is wonderful and lays a deep sense of dread over you. So overall, it has it's moments. Pretty much all of the 2nd half of the game is terrifying, it just takes a little while to get there. I personally thought it was a great balance. However it's not as scary as Frictional games other works, or some other horror games out there. But none of them in my opinion had as cool of a story as this one did.

This is not an endless series of jump scares, like much that dominates the horror genre, but rather an intense exploration of a deep sea research facility haunted by humanity.  Despite a slow start, the game lures you into continuing despite the insane amount omnipresent of tension. Frictional Games succeeds in drawing the player into a world that is terrifying not just because what is happening, but what has happened and forces the audience to explore dark existential philosophy.\nArtfully done that done provides the player with a linear story that can be further fleshed out through exploration - it continually rewards the player for going outside the normal path.  The visuals and audio integrated so that players will often be left wondering whether or not the game is messing with them or if there's actually a monstrosity around the corner.  The controls are smooth, although later in the game there are reports of crashing – I actually had the game crash twice on me.  Nevertheless this is definitely one of the best games of the year and I can’t wait to see more mods added to the game.\n10/10\n","September 26, 2015","true","11.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

After that, I was hooked on Frictionals style and story-telling, even if I had to force myself through the scares.\n\nSOMA then.\nVisuals-  To all veteran consumers of Penumbra and Amnesia, I am glad to say that this game is an amazing progression in almost every category while remaining true with tone and structure(more or less). The sounds and music are phenomenal; the former is utterly convincing and unnerving, the latter is subtly beautiful but powerful enough to drive across the new exciting tone SOMA has introduced. Voice acting is also nearly perfect. The visuals went far beyond what I expected and especially the underwater sequences were especially impressive. The crafting on the environments is also superb. When on entering a bedroom, a messhall, or a laboratory, one can really feel the people who lived there and the events which took place. While not all the areas are outright oppressive, they feel established and genuine.\n\nGameplay-  I found myself initially missing Amnesia: The Dark Descents inventory system, but it never really hampered my progression abillity apart from times when I didn't really know what my character was holding. Overall, I found the puzzles fun, although getting lost can be frusturating. The puzzle complexity is somewhere between the first Amnesia and Penumbra: Black Plague, leaning more toward Black Plague with the importance of computer terminals and electronic challenges. While hunting around for that one component that will make everything work is not fun, it did not happen often.\n\nEnemies/Horror-  This is a scary game. Besides the plot, which I will get to, there are plenty of scares to be found in the bleak visuals, terrifying soundwork and, of course, the antagonists.  I actually found myself initially dissapointed by the levels of terror; after all, both the Penumbra and Amnesia games turned up the horror to 10 pretty speedily. I was soon to realize that this game had a different buildup. Instead of peaking near the middle, the scary in this game peaks near the end. This, along with the fact that I encountered different entities relatively breifly meant that I was rarely at ease in the later half of the game. In fact, I was in such a hurry to evade threats, that I surely missed out on some wonderfully designed environments. What little I saw of the creatures coming at me was very limited, but very effective at increasing my run speed; if anyone knows how much of a monster to show, it's Frictional. Of the sound, however, I got a larger sample. While time spent hoping that the shambling creature threateningly close would just go away was plenty, I never really felt bored due to the horror of their design. As for jumpscares / setpieces, there were two scripted scares I anticipated and one that I really didn't. The game is light on jumpscares, most of the horror comes from the dread of going forward.\n\nNarrative-  Probably the most vivid aspect of an already intense game. As the header indicates, I won't spoil anything, but the story is worth at least a second and third look. In addition to the contextual fright that it adds, it's just plain amazing. The view gleamed in the course of the game seems only like a peek at the massive framework behind it all. Frictional in the past has had problems with ending the story in a way beffiting the rest of the plot, but in my opinion Frictional gets it right here. I will not say any more, but I am already excited to delve into the plot more and more even as I have already finished the game.\n\nAs for anyone who is unaware of previous Frictional Games, this game is for you too. If you are a horror enthusist, sci fi fan, or someone just looking for an experience that isn't dull and washed out, an experience that meant something to your mind: I would highly reccomend a playthough of this game made by a passionate studio by five years of work.","September 24, 2015","true","18.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Lonely. Brooding. Hateful. Alien.\n\nFive words that best describe the atmosphere of SOMA, befitting for a storyline about the relationship between reality, humanity and a fast-approaching future of technological progress. Every room felt so authentic and even if you absolutely, positively knew that you were in a safe, story-based part of the game, it still had the feeling that you were being watched by some terrible intelligence.

The answer is yes!\nPROS\nExcellent story, seriously. Very happy with the arcs and ending throughout. LOVED IT.\n\nExceptional voice acting. Loved the voice work for Catherine.\n\nVery creepy, unsettling atmosphere. Dread floods over you everytime you open a door.\n\nPuzzles were fun and cool to interact with. I found most to be rather easy, which is fine. But there were a few that stumped me for a little awhile. So if you're worried about how hard the game is, it's not that bad.\nCONS\nI might be in the miniority here, but my sytem excels the minimum requirements by a lot, and it auto set everything to "High." However, the game does feel poorly optimized, lots of frame drops, stutters, terrible screen tears, some lackluster graphics/textures. Did this hinder my experience? No, not really. I just to adjust a few settings here and there, but would have loved to see it more optimized.\n\nStealth mechanics could have been a lot better. Especially being that the game is primarily about dodging your foes and hiding from them. For example, you can't hide in lockers/closets/under table or desks. I'm sure there is a reason for this but just a small gripe I had. Overall it works and is probably about as good as Amensia: The Dark Descent's mechanics are.\nSCORE8.75/10\n\nQuick ConclusionSOMA was such a refreshing game. Sure, it esentially follows the same formula that Frictional games has always followed. But I found it to be much more rewarding. The story is incredible, I loved the twists they had on it and it has some very heavy moral issues throughout. You're not penalized for anything that you do, but I can't say that I don't feel guilty about some of the actions I did or had to do. And I'm sure you're all wondering...is it scary? Well, yes and no. I couldn't put this in the pros or cons because it's divided, and in a good way. The game is very unsettling, not overally gory, or filled with jumpscares. But the atmosphere is wonderful and lays a deep sense of dread over you. So overall, it has it's moments. Pretty much all of the 2nd half of the game is terrifying, it just takes a little while to get there. I personally thought it was a great balance. However it's not as scary as Frictional games other works, or some other horror games out there. But none of them in my opinion had as cool of a story as this one did. By far my favorite horror game to date.","September 28, 2015","true","13.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Keep textures on High\nModel design feels lazy, by that all humans having lazy eyes.\nThere are more pictures of the characters, rather models. The reason im sure is above.\nDesign of the unknown and creativity of the world is astonishing. Especially underwater.\nThe futuristic-subterranean-ruin look fits well. Take "Bioshock 1" and "Alien:Isolation" together and ship it\n\nThe Story:\nIt's an exotic intriguing idea. Reasoning may baffle you when emotion and decision come into play.\nThe addition of finding audio-logs/messages are not as helpful to understand many segments of the plot.\nInteresting emotional factor how your main character reacts along the way, dialog based on your decision too.\nThe plot is like a bell-curve by how interesting it gets overtime. Leaves a cliff-hanger, but main point gets across.\n\nThe Audio:\nCreatures/Monsters each have easily notable sound ques of what they are doing.\nEach object has their own sfx. Objects dropping, scraping, and rolling on what surface seems so precise.\nMusic never is dull or repetative while exploring, it fits your suroundings, but not so significant.\nVoice acting is well performed and executed.\n\nThe Conclusion:\nOverall main story of the game, it's good.\nBut guess what will make this game amazing? Yeah, Mods.\nAfter so many Custom Stories for Amnesia, I can't wait what mods will be like for this game.\nFor $30, it's very reasonable for a game of this quality.\n\n\n","September 25, 2015","true","14.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

After that, I was hooked on Frictionals style and story-telling, even if I had to force myself through the scares.\n\nSOMA then.\nVisuals-  To all veteran consumers of Penumbra and Amnesia, I am glad to say that this game is an amazing progression in almost every category while remaining true with tone and structure(more or less). The sounds and music are phenomenal; the former is utterly convincing and unnerving, the latter is subtly beautiful but powerful enough to drive across the new exciting tone SOMA has introduced. Voice acting is also nearly perfect. The visuals went far beyond what I expected and especially the underwater sequences were especially impressive. The crafting on the environments is also superb. When on entering a bedroom, a messhall, or a laboratory, one can really feel the people who lived there and the events which took place. While not all the areas are outright oppressive, they feel established and genuine.\n\nGameplay-  I found myself initially missing Amnesia: The Dark Descents inventory system, but it never really hampered my progression abillity apart from times when I didn't really know what my character was holding. Overall, I found the puzzles fun, although getting lost can be frusturating. The puzzle complexity is somewhere between the first Amnesia and Penumbra: Black Plague, leaning more toward Black Plague with the importance of computer terminals and electronic challenges. While hunting around for that one component that will make everything work is not fun, it did not happen often.\n\nEnemies/Horror-  This is a scary game. Besides the plot, which I will get to, there are plenty of scares to be found in the bleak visuals, terrifying soundwork and, of course, the antagonists.  I actually found myself initially dissapointed by the levels of terror; after all, both the Penumbra and Amnesia games turned up the horror to 10 pretty speedily. I was soon to realize that this game had a different buildup. Instead of peaking near the middle, the scary in this game peaks near the end. This, along with the fact that I encountered different entities relatively breifly meant that I was rarely at ease in the later half of the game. In fact, I was in such a hurry to evade threats, that I surely missed out on some wonderfully designed environments. What little I saw of the creatures coming at me was very limited, but very effective at increasing my run speed; if anyone knows how much of a monster to show, it's Frictional. Of the sound, however, I got a larger sample. While time spent hoping that the shambling creature threateningly close would just go away was plenty, I never really felt bored due to the horror of their design. As for jumpscares / setpieces, there were two scripted scares I anticipated and one that I really didn't. The game is light on jumpscares, most of the horror comes from the dread of going forward.\n\nNarrative-  Probably the most vivid aspect of an already intense game. As the header indicates, I won't spoil anything, but the story is worth at least a second and third look. In addition to the contextual fright that it adds, it's just plain amazing. The view gleamed in the course of the game seems only like a peek at the massive framework behind it all. Frictional in the past has had problems with ending the story in a way beffiting the rest of the plot, but in my opinion Frictional gets it right here. I will not say any more, but I am already excited to delve into the plot more and more even as I have already finished the game.\n\nAs for anyone who is unaware of previous Frictional Games, this game is for you too. If you are a horror enthusist, sci fi fan, or someone just looking for an experience that isn't dull and washed out, an experience that meant something to your mind: I would highly reccomend a playthough of this game made by a passionate studio by five years of work.","September 24, 2015","true","18.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Designed by Frictional Games (the creators of Amnesia), it truly stands out as a masterpiece in the stealth/survival horror genre.\n\nThe story was well crafted and the creators did a great job of landing it at the end to the point where I felt unsettled by it and the choices I made well after I had beaten the game.  The sound effects were also superb!  I was more unsettled by the things I heard than what I actually saw, many times.  That, along with the fascinating setting (think Bioshock meets Amnesia), really made for an atmospheric and immersive experience!\n\nMy only qualm was that the voice acting came off a little flat.  The inflections in the characters voices just did not convey the true horror of what was happening around them and came off as very matter of fact.  As if seeming to compensate for this, the main character would fill the silence during certain scenes by getting very long winded and philisophical about pivotal moments during the game's story.  As if the creators of the game did not fully trust that players would be able to pick up on those elements themselves.\n\nWith the exception of the voice acting (which wasn't terrible - just not great), it was an excellent game and well worth playing!","October 3, 2015","true","21.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Unlike a movie or a book though you are not a passive receiver of the story but rather active. SOMA also manages too feel like a book without any explicit need too stop the experience through save stations or such things, just play for a while, immerse yourself as much as you like and stop when ever you want or need too.\n\nSOMA manages to deliver both on story and feeling as well as touch on some rather deep philosophical questions about the self and what it means to exist. Being a fan of both Horror and sci-fi combined with a like for philosophical ideas made this game almost ridiculously tailored to things I like so i might be somewhat bias, but to me SOMA did not disappoint. The ideas presented in SOMA are some I've thought of myself from time to time, and SOMA is now a great excuse for me to talk to my friends about these concepts. To those not familiar with these ideas I urge you to play this game: It is likely blow your mind, and will lead to some interesting conversations.\n\nLike any great movie or any great book SOMA leaves you feeling a little different and with some strange new thoughts in your head.","October 3, 2015","true","14.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is as philosophical as it is creepy - at times, you'll be holding your breath, hiding in corners and trying to dodge monsters.  Other moments, you'll be exploring the environment and picking up little clues.  This isn't a game that you play to win.  It's a game that you play to discover and ponder.  It is also very much a horror game - expect tense situations, the occasional jump scare, and a building sense of dread.\n\nThe puzzles throughout the game were more challenging than its predecessor, Amnesia: The Dark Descent.  I was left scratching my head on a few occasions, though if you keep exploring and trying everything available, the solution usually presents itself and saves you from having to look up the solution online.\n\nThe monster AI also got a little trickier - they can hear you much better, and they tend to adjust their patrol routes based on where your character was detected.  There are also a host of different monsters with different behaviors, and you must figure out how each monster works to successfully evade them.\n\nSome cons with the game - make sure your video settings are adjusted correctly.  Even at some of the lowest video settings, I experienced some framerate drop and lagging, especially in the larger environments and extremely sensitive situations, for example, when an angry monster is chasing you as if you just insulted the entire maternal side of its family.  Loss of coordination due to framerate drop can make for some clumsy gameplay and repeated, frustrating deaths.\n\n","September 24, 2015","true","6.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Marquez1032/recommended/282140/","Marquez1032","Marquez","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Marquez1032/","22 products in account","Introduction\nSOMA is a sci-fi, horror game where you play as Simon Jerett, a man with an unknown brain condition who lives in Toronto and is the subject of a research project to find a cure. Once the vague introductions and mini tutorial is done, things go to hell and you are suddenly dumped into an apocolyptic, underwater world with very little info and very little capabilities. The game is set in an underwater station known as PATHOS: II underneath the Atlantic Ocean that is remotely controlled by a powerful A.I. known as W.A.U, also known as Warden. The first few objectives are figuring out just exactly when and where you are on Earth, why you've been placed there and how to escape. As the game progresses, the main plot begins to unravel and aims to question your humanity and enforce a bleak outlook on the future of mankind when all hope is seemingly lost.\n\nIn this review I will use a 1 to 10 grading scale and provide summaries of several aspects of this game such as graphics, gameplay, sound and story.\n\n(WARNING: May contain minor spoilers)\n\nGameplay:\n8.5/10\n\nThe gameplay revolves around a "hide and sneak" style of play where you can't confront the various entities out to get you and to find various bits and pieces of information to progress with the plot and figure everything out. There some actions such as "grabbing", "running" and interacting with online computers but there are very little options on how to go about, which aims to add to its horror element with a sense of frailty and limitation. You can't take a haphazard approach and have to go around logically and patiently which will end up making the game a lot simpler and less frustrating. There are also some "puzzles" and tasks to complete the more you progress in order to continue on, but they aren't very difficult and are just there to add to the story. The various monsters in this game tend to be scary at first, but after a few attempts and exposure it lightens the horror element and end up annoying and hindering you. Even if you end up getting caught, the game is pretty generous about giving you second chances and even provides "healing" stations in the form of a black organism you stick your hand into to help you recover from an "injured state". Overall, the difficulty isnt that high and the main object of this game is the plot and to immerse yourself in the game by putting yourself in SImon's shoes which the game does a good job of doing.\n\n\nGraphics:\n9/10\n\nThe game has little lighting a majority of the time and can get blurry, but is aesthetically pleasing when looking at the environment and some of the several monsters you will encounter as you go along. The actual people aren't as nice to look at compared to other high-end games since the level of detail you find when looking at the surroundings just isn't there when looking at other humans, even if there are very few of them hanging around and are usually disfigured beyond recognition. Overall, since the game is in first person and revolves around knowing your environment to make out the various clues and key items, the graphics are appealing to eye and gives the game more depth to its horror aspect.\n\n\nSound:\n9.5/10\n\nThe sounds in this game really compliment the graphics and surroundings which really create the game's horror theme. The background sounds leave you tense from start to finish and constantly remind you just how bad the situation your in truly is. The sounds also help with actual gameplay and can point you in the right direction by listening to subtle "foreign" sounds and random footsteps coming from enemies. The voice acting is pretty well done and goes along with the depressing theme of the game. Overall, the sounds in this game are one of its finer aspects and can play an important role in the game which helps make immersing yourself into the game easier.\n\nStory:\n9/10\n\nAs a sci-fi game, everything takes place in the future where technology is much more advanced and humanity has achieved a new form of consciousness through machines. There are a few plot twists and turns but for the most part the actual plot is linear and there isn't many actions that actually affect the story or outcome besides some personal choices based on your own morals and actions. The actual storyline is pretty interesting and keeps you intrigued enough to actually see it through to the end to see and achieve your ultimate fate as Simon. You only develop one real relationship through the hellish journey and in a way helps to add to the distraughting atmosphere that constantly surrounds PATHOS: II. Overall, the storyline felt like a mixture of other sci-fi games/movies at times but in the end still retains its own genuine plot with a unique, somewhat unexpected ending.\n\nOptimization:\n8/10\n\nThe game can get buggy at times and loading up new areas or from saved states can cause minor lagging and frame skips. Also, Nvidia users don't always get ideal FPS despite having high-end graphics cards, especially if using SLi. For the most part though, the game runs smoothly and isn't very taxing on the CPU or RAM. Its a modest ~11 GB install and playable for most users. Overall, the optimization isn't perfect and can be improved but not game breaking and noticeable only when going into new areas.\n\n\nFinal Score:\n8.5/10\n\nI originally bought this game as a horror game first and sci-fi game second, but ended up getting reversed while still enjoying and appreciating the game. It was a little shorter than I expected it to be and the plot offerred little variety or consquences to your actions, which was a bummer, but it was still a good time sink and I was satisfied with the blend of horror and plot. I would recommend this game to others if they are fans of the sci-fi genre with a fair amount of horror to compliment it.","September 23, 2015","true","12.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you like Amneisa, if you like horror-themed games in general, buy and play it.\nThe long of it: while I doubt this game will have the same impact on the gaming community that Amnesia did, SOMA is pretty damn good regardless.\nPros:\n- A great story. If you've watched the trailers, you'll know that transhumanism runs strong here, with questions about what is to be human, and how our technological progress might one day dangerously blur the line between humanity and machine. Trust me, you don't know how far down the rabbit hole goes on this one.\n- New and improved graphics make this a gorgeous and atmospheric game, with an immersive world that draws you in. It makes you want to stop and look around a bit... if you ever felt like it was safe to do so.\n- The game uses much of the same gameplay model as Amnesia, so yes, you will be hiding and running from your adversaries. For some, that may not be innovative enough, but I think the model still works to ramp up the tension and scares. And there are some great sequences beyond the "being hunted" moments as well.\nCons:\n- Not very replayable. I don't know if the mod scene will be as strong here as it was for Amnesia, but we'll see.\n- The game uses a lot of blurring and distortion effects. Good for atmosphere, bad on the eyes at times. It may or may not affect your enjoyment of the game, but you can dial down such things if it gets to you.\n- Not the best voice-acting from the protagonist, though other characters are more serviceable.\nSo, again, if you like your games horrific and thought-provoking, give this one a go.","September 25, 2015","true","17.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you've played any of Frictional's games then you'll know the exact type of environmental puzzles you'll find. Much like A Machine for Pigs there is (almost) no actual inventory menu instead opting to keep all puzzles centralized with the answers to them all right there.\n\nBUT WHAT ABOUT THE HORROR!? Some may ask, well I'm here to tell you that if you find guttural growls and dilapidated infrastructure horrifying then boy you better bring a new pair of pants. This game is very atmospheric and it can get fairly tense, but I would not call a single second of this game scary. Frustrating at times, yes, but never scary. On that note it is much closer to A Machine for Pigs than it is TDD. A well fleshed out universe with a horror backdrop used to tell a hreat story.\n\nGoing back to the frustrating parts this game does have one or two sections that are flat out poorly designed where the AI and environment work together to make an unknown objective even more convoluted to find, Ruined the pacing and left a really bad aftertaste.\n\nAside from those sections above the game is fantastic if you want a fantastic immersive experience in a survival horror setting.\n9/10","October 7, 2015","true","10.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's another absolutely fantastic product from Frictional Games, and I'd recommend it to all who have enjoyed their past titles as well as horror game lovers alike.\n\nPros:\n-Fantastic story that really pulls you in; it truly connects you to the main character and their emotions towards the world around them.\n-Immersive and beautifully detailed environment\n-Simplified game mechanics\n-Finally, animated people!  Woo Frictional!!\n-Overall a fantastic game that is as well written and put together, at least in my opinion, as games such as Bioshock (if you're a fan of Bioshock by the way, absolutely try this).\n\n\n\nCons:\n-Less puzzle, more story (may be a pro for some).\n-Scary, even terrifying, for sure. But, not as bone chilling as Amnesia: The Dark Descent.\n-Some enemy encounters feel more like a nuscience than a life-in-danger situaiton.\n-At the time of writing this review (October 6th, 2015), high system requirements; low performance on devices (even modern ones) not built for gaming.  My home desktop with my GTX 580 can power through just fine, but my laptop (HP Envy x360) gives me a measely 20 frames.\n\nJust to reiterate, you don't have to have played Frictional's other titles to enjoy this one.

It's their first game after Amnesia: The Dark Descent.\n\nThe game follows survival horror tropes, and as like Amnesia, you can't fight your enemies. Encounters with enemies are based on a system in which you have to turn off lights, hide in closets etc.\n\nSo if you're looking for an experience akin to Dead Space / Bioshock this will not be your thing. If you're looking for experiences similiar to Penumbra, Amnesia or Outlast this will be your thing.\n\nCompared to the previous games mentioned Soma is very slow. The story progresses slowly and the overall the scares are built with time. There is some shock value also, but not nearly to the extent of something like Outlast. (That's a good thing)\n\nThe story of this game is something I've never seen in a video game. It's a weird mix of The Matrix and Ex Machina, but it totally works in the context of the game. They clearly went all out.\n\nOverall I would recommend Soma to anyone who is interested in slow horror like Amnesia. It's a good follow up from Frictional Games and deserves your money.

I am happy to have spent 20 quid on this, not only as its a good game, a nice walk through expereince, but is a fine example of the niche Frictional make for...\n\nSOMA is a thought provoking, pleasure to admire (even on a GFX weak PC)  and eventually, an impressive story; just what Frictional are good at...\n\nAdditionally, if you have played Amnesia before, then its worth noting that the puzzles are more intuitive, which is definitely a good part of the game;  They are not really hard, but are a welcome addition to the game in general.  In comparison to this game, Amnesia 1's puzzles were rather simple (from what I remember).\n\nAs a negative point, most items cannot be picked up (no more power ups) and the only reason to explore is to feed your own interest in an area, or to find something to 'heal'.  In a few words, unless you are given an 'instruction' and you are in a large complicated level, there is no real point of exploring; though the less linear levels (which serve as paths to the next objective) normally do have to be explored to find a way out of, or (as above) to secure objectives.\n\nThis is an initial impression of an unbeaten game and I am unsure of where I will be when i finish it, but for the current moment, I am immersed in this fantastic game! For it's environment, the experience, the story and the really clever concepts that Frictional have brought through.  I come away from this and still find the concept is worth thinking about... The game is really worth the time in numerous ways!\n\nIt also consummates to me, to kill the cancer I have developed with regards to 'Amnesia a Machine for Pigs', (which was a second rate gaming expereince in my own oppinion, unless you like the *Pretties* 8) ) which is pretty boring incomparison to this( 'Chinese room' made that game, not 'Frictional')... even if sometimes I remember the game looking very 'Pretty' incomparison , the entire package here is SOOO much deeper and worth your time.

SOMA is an incredible experience !\n\nThe complex story with unexpected turns of situations and how it will affect you associated to an amazing underwater atmosphere is enough to recommend this game !\n\nSo okay, it's not really horror though some part made me jump and there some really messed up gloomy stuff, there aren't many monsters (they don't have all an original scary look though creeepy they are) and they're not very bright either AND most if not every objects are useless, lots of useless places... but don't let that turn you down because you'd be missing out on the great experience this game can offer :)\n\nSOMA is a great experience for it's graphism, for the way it tells you the story, for it's atmosphere and the too rare setting it puts you in. Underwater based game aren't really legion and this well done even less (lighting and effects will definitely immerse you).\n\nIt's the kind of game I'd love to do again if they ever updated for the oculus rift when it will come out! =)\n\nSo, don't listen to all the hatred on the reviews, they might complain comparing it to Amnesia and such, stupid puzzles, not much horror, stupid monsters (some are totally blind, you can avoid another by not looking at it, ...) but I don't think those people really enjoyed the game for what it is... A creepy really well told story in an amazing world !\n\nIn the end, it was totally worth paying it at full price but if you're looking for a game that will chill you to the bones with plenty of horrible monsters then you might want to skip this one.\nIf you hate hide and seek games with monsters and prefer to defend yourself with heavy weapons, then again, skip this game ! It's not what it is.\nIf you do not like to take your time with a game and explore every useless place to read notes or just look at the decoration of a room, then skip this game, you won't enjoy SOMA if you just run straight to the next objective.\n\nSOMA is a game with a creepy story you will play for it's atmosphere, the game doesn't have any replayability whatsoever exept if you want to learn speedrun it...

One of the greatest atmospheric horror story driven games I've ever played. My first exposure to Frictional Games was through Amnesia: The Dark Descent - from that point onward I was a fan of the company. SOMA explores the psychological and physical aspects of a story driven narrative very well. It makes you think, ponder the choices of your actions, and see how a world that was once vibrant and alive descend into madness and despair.\n\nThe engine for this game is very impressive, giving it a very unique atmosphere that is very hard to find in other games (to me it was a mixture of Bioshock and Dead Space without weapons!). There was the occasional AI frustration, but they were well designed, and reacted very amazingly. Puzzles were simple and well done, very unique without repeating itself, but at times they were so simple that I ran around a bit too long looking for them. At least there's an interactivity highlight option in the menu you can set if you'd want an easier time finding items and puzzles to interact.\n\nI love love love the storyline. It certainly gives you a range of feelings and you certainly grow fond of the characters you interact with and care for their well being, especially towards the last quarter of the playthrough. The monsters and other dangerous creatures you encounter are very well designed and unexpected. The music and dialogue was memorable and downright creepy at times. The story, music, and atmosphere will stay with me for quite a very long time to come. This kind of game definitely warrants a second playthrough, it is that good!","October 3, 2015","true","12.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Long story short, if you enjoy a good thriller & adventure with a very good narrative GET THIS GAME.

I would put the scary-score on medium. Some monsters (like those towards the end) are really scary, others are just non-scary and annoying.\n- Really long loading times. I don't know if it is my computer, but it's not particularly fun to watch an almost black screen for 5 minutes every now and then\n- They kept it too simple. There is not even a real inventory this time and I wish that after all the negative feedback on Machine for Pigs feeling too much like a walking simulator, Frictional would step up the game and introduce more stuff/features for the game. This isn't like Machine for Pigs, but is not like Dark Descent or any old survival horror game either, it's more scaled down. For both better and worst.\n\nWith all that ♥♥♥♥ out of my chest, I think this is one of the best games 2015. The story, the way it is told is actually the most creepy part about SOMA. It is not a new theme in sci-fi ("What is consciousness?") but the way it is told while you are pushing through this dark adventure, it  explores every aspect of this kind of story and results in becoming an eerie tale filled with much ambiguity. Second, the atmosphere and the setting is crazy - SOMA definetly does underwater way better than Bioshock. The intro of the game also helps to give it a bizarre Alice in Wonderland-feeling, with you wondering how deep the rabbit hole really is. Gameplay is... okay. It's still just the normal hide-n-seek horror with nothing new added to it. But it is generally well-designed, though sometimes during dangerous situations it is not always 100% clear on what you are supposed to do. But I got a few scares and I had fun during most of the game. I definetly recommend this game for any horror-fan and also sci-fi-fans.","October 3, 2015","true","13.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Designed by Frictional Games (the creators of Amnesia), it truly stands out as a masterpiece in the stealth/survival horror genre.\n\nThe story was well crafted and the creators did a great job of landing it at the end to the point where I felt unsettled by it and the choices I made well after I had beaten the game.  The sound effects were also superb!  I was more unsettled by the things I heard than what I actually saw, many times.  That, along with the fascinating setting (think Bioshock meets Amnesia), really made for an atmospheric and immersive experience!\n\nMy only qualm was that the voice acting came off a little flat.  The inflections in the characters voices just did not convey the true horror of what was happening around them and came off as very matter of fact.  As if seeming to compensate for this, the main character would fill the silence during certain scenes by getting very long winded and philisophical about pivotal moments during the game's story.  As if the creators of the game did not fully trust that players would be able to pick up on those elements themselves.\n\nWith the exception of the voice acting (which wasn't terrible - just not great), it was an excellent game and well worth playing!","October 3, 2015","true","21.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Unlike a movie or a book though you are not a passive receiver of the story but rather active. SOMA also manages too feel like a book without any explicit need too stop the experience through save stations or such things, just play for a while, immerse yourself as much as you like and stop when ever you want or need too.\n\nSOMA manages to deliver both on story and feeling as well as touch on some rather deep philosophical questions about the self and what it means to exist. Being a fan of both Horror and sci-fi combined with a like for philosophical ideas made this game almost ridiculously tailored to things I like so i might be somewhat bias, but to me SOMA did not disappoint. The ideas presented in SOMA are some I've thought of myself from time to time, and SOMA is now a great excuse for me to talk to my friends about these concepts. To those not familiar with these ideas I urge you to play this game: It is likely blow your mind, and will lead to some interesting conversations.\n\nLike any great movie or any great book SOMA leaves you feeling a little different and with some strange new thoughts in your head.","October 3, 2015","true","14.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But there are parts that are scary.\n\nSecond of all, the story, is fantastic, i absolutely loved it... This has one of the best stories i have ever played in a game... the way you discover things along with the main character are brilliant. It keeps you wanting to find out what happens next, which basically meant that i played this game in 3 sittings.

The choices you have in order to accomplish something greater. Even if it depends on ending this life and starting anew elsewhere, a new chapter.\n\nIt's not just about the scary, the weirdness and the psycho, it has it's true morals. it puts you in a space to think about what would be left of you if you're out there all alone.  I really, absolutely, love the story.\nI think it was creative. they put multiple elements and ideas together and made it a whole. A game full of puzzles and moral choices you have to make.\n\nAs for the gameplay itself, controlling and interacting with objects is a lot easier than in past games I think. The indications that an object is pickable and such is a little more 'obvious'.\nThe path you walk is rather linear, but you can always turn another way to explore more, read logs, find clues or what happened around the place. But be alert; you might accidentally break something and you're left in the dark. :) ...\n\nI especially liked it because, unlike A LOT OF OTHER horror games, this one doesn't depend solely on jumpscares. it's the pure atmosphere and depths of the story as you progress which make it dig deep into your mind and feel uneasy.\n\nThere are only a few points where monsters are a little annoying rather than scary to handle, but they still did a great job of creating the atmosphere in which you are placed when you encounter one.\n\nFrictional at it's best. I think they're still the masters at this. 10/10","October 12, 2015","true","22.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I am happy to have spent 20 quid on this, not only as its a good game, a nice walk through expereince, but is a fine example of the niche Frictional make for...\n\nSOMA is a thought provoking, pleasure to admire (even on a GFX weak PC)  and eventually, an impressive story; just what Frictional are good at...\n\nAdditionally, if you have played Amnesia before, then its worth noting that the puzzles are more intuitive, which is definitely a good part of the game;  They are not really hard, but are a welcome addition to the game in general.  In comparison to this game, Amnesia 1's puzzles were rather simple (from what I remember).\n\nAs a negative point, most items cannot be picked up (no more power ups) and the only reason to explore is to feed your own interest in an area, or to find something to 'heal'.  In a few words, unless you are given an 'instruction' and you are in a large complicated level, there is no real point of exploring; though the less linear levels (which serve as paths to the next objective) normally do have to be explored to find a way out of, or (as above) to secure objectives.\n\nThis is an initial impression of an unbeaten game and I am unsure of where I will be when i finish it, but for the current moment, I am immersed in this fantastic game! For it's environment, the experience, the story and the really clever concepts that Frictional have brought through.  I come away from this and still find the concept is worth thinking about... The game is really worth the time in numerous ways!\n\nIt also consummates to me, to kill the cancer I have developed with regards to 'Amnesia a Machine for Pigs', (which was a second rate gaming expereince in my own oppinion, unless you like the *Pretties* 8) ) which is pretty boring incomparison to this( 'Chinese room' made that game, not 'Frictional')... even if sometimes I remember the game looking very 'Pretty' incomparison , the entire package here is SOOO much deeper and worth your time.

It's their first game after Amnesia: The Dark Descent.\n\nThe game follows survival horror tropes, and as like Amnesia, you can't fight your enemies. Encounters with enemies are based on a system in which you have to turn off lights, hide in closets etc.\n\nSo if you're looking for an experience akin to Dead Space / Bioshock this will not be your thing. If you're looking for experiences similiar to Penumbra, Amnesia or Outlast this will be your thing.\n\nCompared to the previous games mentioned Soma is very slow. The story progresses slowly and the overall the scares are built with time. There is some shock value also, but not nearly to the extent of something like Outlast. (That's a good thing)\n\nThe story of this game is something I've never seen in a video game. It's a weird mix of The Matrix and Ex Machina, but it totally works in the context of the game. They clearly went all out.\n\nOverall I would recommend Soma to anyone who is interested in slow horror like Amnesia. It's a good follow up from Frictional Games and deserves your money. It's not a full priced game even, which is great.","October 24, 2015","true","23.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was so engaged by the depth of the story I didn't mind the level of linearity of the gameplay, which was like riding a roller coaster.

I have been waiting for this game to be finished for YEARS and I am so glad it went above and beyond my expectations. I was impressed with the storyline and character development, I really felt for Catherine and Simon, and I found myself rooting for their survival throughout the game. Also the sense of immersion was incredible. The world while there are a few loopholes, is very immersive and well-done. It had a very Penumbra feel in regards to the storyline, but SOMA was far more upbeat. Rather than having a completely depressing outlook like Daniel in Amnesia where it's hard to find redemption, SOMA takes you to the lowest lows in regards to human survival and morality and gives you a very compelling shred of hope, and sense of awe when it comes to the wonders of being a human being. It also leaves you with some major philosophical questions in regards to, "what is a soul?" and "what defines human consciousness?" After beating the game I kind of just wanted to go lay in the grass somewhere, stare at some clouds and take a moment to say "Damn, it's great to be alive." Not many "horror" genre games make you think, and for that I think SOMA will take it's place on a pedestal as one of the best horror games out there. It's not just the scares, it's the overall experience that sells it.\n\nThe Gameplay: One of my biggest concerns was whether or not it would be like Frictional's other works and have only one or two enemies, but SOMA has loads of 'em, and some of them had me damn near peeing my pants. Really felt like they did some great improvements with the AI. As someone who's played hundreds of hours in Amnesia and custom stories, let me say that damn one of those last enemies really will NOT GET OFF YOUR ♥♥♥. Like you really have to be sneaky as all hell to get past these guys and I enjoy that challenge. Also makes the game very re-playable. The blur mechanic when you're close to enemies is pretty useful, but it can be annoying when you're trying to see. Mostly when your health is low, it's almost better to just kill yourself and re-do after a certain amount of blur. Otherwise, runs great, beautiful game. Minor lag on loading screens but very worth for the visual results.\n\nOverall: 10/10 loved it.

What is life? What is consciousness? Who is to decide the answers to those questions?\n\nI think, therefore I am. Right?\n\nEven after the ~15 hours it took me to see the credits rolling down my monitor, these are just some of the questions that still boggles my mind. It's games like this that may make your head spin, and to question your very own existence.\n\nEven with the above being said, remember that this is a horror game and it may make you s**t your pants.\n\nOh well. On to the game itself.\n\n\nAside from being scary, the game offers an extremely deep atmosphere and story. Combine this with existential questions, horrifying gameplay and breathtaking artistic design, graphics and sound, and you should at least have an idea what this game has to offer.\n\nWithout spoiling the story or any plot points, I will just say that if you're a fan of sci-fi, you will greatly enjoy the story and the setting this gorgeous, yet haunting looking world has to offer. It will also force you to make some very morally difficult choices, unless you're a cold-hearted human being that is. This is one of those games that sucks you into it's world, making you not wanting to exit the game until you've reached the credits.\n\nIf you ever played Amnesia, the last masterpiece released by the same company, you should feel right at home with the controls and physics offered by this game. Pulling out desk drawers, opening doors, it's all controlled the same way (holding the mouse button down and moving the mouse) and feels just as good.\n\nWhile there is no inventory screen you can still carry some items around with you that are used automatically in their proper places. There is also no HUD for health, but the game gives you very good visual feedback about how close you are to dying. When really low on health you can no longer sprint and instead are limping around and the screen gets much blurrier etc.\n\nThe game ran fine on my GTX970 and I managed to almost always maintain 60fps on the highest settings at 1920x1080 resolution (except when the game clearly loaded the world and it dropped). I found some minor bugs, like places where you could exit the level's boundaries although they required me  to really going out of my way to jump around looking for them (as I have a tendency to do :P ), otherwise no game breaking bugs to report.\n\nSo, without dragging this out too long, here are my conclusions.\n\nWould I recommend this game?\n\nIf you like great stories and atmosphere where you can really take your time to absorb and interact with the world around you, then yes, without a doubt.\n\nIf you enjoyed Amnesia, then yes, this is for you as well.\n\nIf you're too afraid of scary games, but still want to experience the story? I'd say stay the **** away!\n\nIs it worth the 27,99€€ steam asks for it?\n\nAfter completion, for me, personally, that's a "Yes, definitely".\n\n\nps. "robots" can be freaking terrifying.

Once the vague introductions and mini tutorial is done, things go to hell and you are suddenly dumped into an apocolyptic, underwater world with very little info and very little capabilities. The game is set in an underwater station known as PATHOS: II underneath the Atlantic Ocean that is remotely controlled by a powerful A.I. known as W.A.U, also known as Warden. The first few objectives are figuring out just exactly when and where you are on Earth, why you've been placed there and how to escape. As the game progresses, the main plot begins to unravel and aims to question your humanity and enforce a bleak outlook on the future of mankind when all hope is seemingly lost.\n\nIn this review I will use a 1 to 10 grading scale and provide summaries of several aspects of this game such as graphics, gameplay, sound and story.\n\n(WARNING: May contain minor spoilers)\n\nGameplay:\n8.5/10\n\nThe gameplay revolves around a "hide and sneak" style of play where you can't confront the various entities out to get you and to find various bits and pieces of information to progress with the plot and figure everything out. There some actions such as "grabbing", "running" and interacting with online computers but there are very little options on how to go about, which aims to add to its horror element with a sense of frailty and limitation. You can't take a haphazard approach and have to go around logically and patiently which will end up making the game a lot simpler and less frustrating. There are also some "puzzles" and tasks to complete the more you progress in order to continue on, but they aren't very difficult and are just there to add to the story. The various monsters in this game tend to be scary at first, but after a few attempts and exposure it lightens the horror element and end up annoying and hindering you. Even if you end up getting caught, the game is pretty generous about giving you second chances and even provides "healing" stations in the form of a black organism you stick your hand into to help you recover from an "injured state". Overall, the difficulty isnt that high and the main object of this game is the plot and to immerse yourself in the game by putting yourself in SImon's shoes which the game does a good job of doing.\n\n\nGraphics:\n9/10\n\nThe game has little lighting a majority of the time and can get blurry, but is aesthetically pleasing when looking at the environment and some of the several monsters you will encounter as you go along. The actual people aren't as nice to look at compared to other high-end games since the level of detail you find when looking at the surroundings just isn't there when looking at other humans, even if there are very few of them hanging around and are usually disfigured beyond recognition. Overall, since the game is in first person and revolves around knowing your environment to make out the various clues and key items, the graphics are appealing to eye and gives the game more depth to its horror aspect.\n\n\nSound:\n9.5/10\n\nThe sounds in this game really compliment the graphics and surroundings which really create the game's horror theme. The background sounds leave you tense from start to finish and constantly remind you just how bad the situation your in truly is. The sounds also help with actual gameplay and can point you in the right direction by listening to subtle "foreign" sounds and random footsteps coming from enemies. The voice acting is pretty well done and goes along with the depressing theme of the game. Overall, the sounds in this game are one of its finer aspects and can play an important role in the game which helps make immersing yourself into the game easier.\n\nStory:\n9/10\n\nAs a sci-fi game, everything takes place in the future where technology is much more advanced and humanity has achieved a new form of consciousness through machines. There are a few plot twists and turns but for the most part the actual plot is linear and there isn't many actions that actually affect the story or outcome besides some personal choices based on your own morals and actions. The actual storyline is pretty interesting and keeps you intrigued enough to actually see it through to the end to see and achieve your ultimate fate as Simon. You only develop one real relationship through the hellish journey and in a way helps to add to the distraughting atmosphere that constantly surrounds PATHOS: II. Overall, the storyline felt like a mixture of other sci-fi games/movies at times but in the end still retains its own genuine plot with a unique, somewhat unexpected ending.\n\nOptimization:\n8/10\n\nThe game can get buggy at times and loading up new areas or from saved states can cause minor lagging and frame skips. Also, Nvidia users don't always get ideal FPS despite having high-end graphics cards, especially if using SLi. For the most part though, the game runs smoothly and isn't very taxing on the CPU or RAM. Its a modest ~11 GB install and playable for most users. Overall, the optimization isn't perfect and can be improved but not game breaking and noticeable only when going into new areas.\n\n\nFinal Score:\n8.5/10\n\nI originally bought this game as a horror game first and sci-fi game second, but ended up getting reversed while still enjoying and appreciating the game. It was a little shorter than I expected it to be and the plot offerred little variety or consquences to your actions, which was a bummer, but it was still a good time sink and I was satisfied with the blend of horror and plot. I would recommend this game to others if they are fans of the sci-fi genre with a fair amount of horror to compliment it.","September 23, 2015","true","12.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you like Amneisa, if you like horror-themed games in general, buy and play it.\nThe long of it: while I doubt this game will have the same impact on the gaming community that Amnesia did, SOMA is pretty damn good regardless.\nPros:\n- A great story. If you've watched the trailers, you'll know that transhumanism runs strong here, with questions about what is to be human, and how our technological progress might one day dangerously blur the line between humanity and machine. Trust me, you don't know how far down the rabbit hole goes on this one.\n- New and improved graphics make this a gorgeous and atmospheric game, with an immersive world that draws you in. It makes you want to stop and look around a bit... if you ever felt like it was safe to do so.\n- The game uses much of the same gameplay model as Amnesia, so yes, you will be hiding and running from your adversaries. For some, that may not be innovative enough, but I think the model still works to ramp up the tension and scares. And there are some great sequences beyond the "being hunted" moments as well.\nCons:\n- Not very replayable. I don't know if the mod scene will be as strong here as it was for Amnesia, but we'll see.\n- The game uses a lot of blurring and distortion effects. Good for atmosphere, bad on the eyes at times. It may or may not affect your enjoyment of the game, but you can dial down such things if it gets to you.\n- Not the best voice-acting from the protagonist, though other characters are more serviceable.\nSo, again, if you like your games horrific and thought-provoking, give this one a go.","September 25, 2015","true","17.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a little more story focused, and there's definitely lighter gameplay mechanics (no inventory management or lamp fuel / flashlight batteries), but I wasn't annoyed because there was still enough stuff for me to DO in the game.\n\nYou'll trek from one end of a facility to the other in search of some sci-fi macguffin all the while sneaking around a monster that will do unspeakable things to you. Every monster was great in its own way, mostly due to Frictional's best sound design to date. They all have a certain caveat to them that makes each encounter fun. I've heard some complaints about the monster AI being bad,  but I guess I played in a way that didn't reveal their flaws as much.\n\nSOMA paces itself a little more than The Dark Descent, with peaks of horror and valleys of exploration and story exposition. The story and setting is ridiculously 70s/80s sci-fi, it's great. One of the things about the story... you know "meaningful choices"? That buzzword that companies like BioWare and Telltale like to use? SOMA is the only game that I've played that actually has them.\n\nYou are put in situations where you must make choices through actual gameplay, not conversation options. The game never judges you for them, it doesn't really care what you do. It only asks "how do you feel about yourself?" There are very few "correct" choices and there was never a choice that I made that I didn't feel conflicted about.\n\nSOMA is really good. And, I would recommend it to any fan of science fiction.","October 25, 2015","true","10.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So first off Graphics are not too hot; as was playing it I was wondering what they could been able to do with a AAA budget.  For whatever they had to work with the game really comes through. It’s a fleshed out world and you are immersed in the 10 to 12-hour experience. The A.I is not the best either.  I took my time crouching metal gear solid style and I never had any problems walking through the levels.   The scares are here but it’s not that frightening.  What propels you through this game is its amazing story.  I never had a game really push me to my edge in morality what I thought was wrong or right.  What is life?  The more I played the game the more I cared about the characters and like them.  I had a lot of, “what would I really do in this situation.”  That something I love about games and this game does it so well. This is one of the best cohesive stories.  It hits close to home.  If you like horror, then I recommend this to you it’s not the scariest game you will play.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/funkyfinzy/recommended/282140/","funkyfinzy","FunkyFinzy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/funkyfinzy/","186 products in account","(Spoiler free review, apart from mostly basic gameplay related stuffs)\n\nA very enjoyable horror game from the creators of Amnesia: The Dark Descent, and one with an extremely good, well-written story and a unique setting that sets it far apart from other horror games. Forget about dark dungeons and being scared by zombies. SOMA is about human existence and everything associated with it, and I'd say the plot is similar to The Talos Principle in that regard, and instead of those dark dungeons, you get to explore the very bottom of the ocean and various facilities, often submerged in water.\n\nI liked the main character, he seemed very believable with his reactions to things, as well as all the various side characters you interact with, most importantly Catherine, who plays bit of a sidekick role via your Omnitool now and then. I don't believe it substracted from the experience in any way, for the vast majority of the game you are still alone in a very hostile environment, and the chances to interact are limited to brief visits in computer terminals, and if anything it just made the world more believable. The game also offers you a good deal of moral choices to make along the way which add to the immersion, though they don't majorly alter the experience, I still felt very conscious about what I chose to do (even felt bad for something I did at the beginning of the game, without knowing better).\n\nThe sound design is top notch just like in Amnesia and most of the game's athmosphere and scariness comes from that, creating a very unsettling mood at all times. You'll be scared just walking through areas that are supposedly safe in anticipation of encounters. The graphics also look great and the game performs pretty well, had some stuttering in a few areas on my machine but given my specs I was amazed it ran this well at all.\n\nI thought the gameplay overall was an improvement over Amnesia. Larger areas (especially vast underwater zones where you can even feel lost), more stuff to do and interact with (computer terminals especially). I also thought the enemy design and behavior was better this time around, as in, the enemies were actually a challenge to the player and I loved that. Instead of enemies disappearing into thin air every time you go lock yourself in a closet or cry in a corner (which I did a lot in Amnesia), SOMA's enemies most of the time will resume hunting you relentlessly and you'll be challenged into finding ways of getting around them instead of just waiting. They sense the player far better as well and can unexpectedly surprise you by opening doors in areas you thought were perfectly safe. The only time I recall myself being annoyed by an enemy was late in the game when they managed to hunt me into a corner and wouldn't give up the chase, so I had to basically let myself be killed by them in order to continue, but I suppose that was also my fault.\nThe puzzle design was very good, nearly every single puzzle was fully logical and fun to figure out, I barely ever got stuck for a long time without finding the solution by just creative thinking.\n\nThe underwater setting really made the game tons more interesting and I wish the game had been a bit longer or had more underwater sections, especially as near the end of the game you are introduced to some very interesting....sea creatures. Don't wanna spoil anything but I loved that section, having only lights to guide you, and some of those lights tricking you and such. Actually felt lost at that point since I lost my direction fleeing into a cave. Another weak point of the game is that it loses oomph towards the end, I thought I reached the conclusion of the story too easily and there should have been more severe things happening, especially depending on what choice you did just before the ending.\n\nOverall though, if you liked Amnesia, and you like a bit more mature/different story in horror games, I'd fully recommend this. The story and athmosphere are the absolute strongest points of the game, and the story is really best experienced without knowing anything about it.","November 9, 2015","true","17.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(Bioshock, I should apologize for that remark - I still love you xoxo)\n\nThe sound design fills you with an overwhelming sense of dread, constantly making you question if you really did just hear something...or perhaps it was just your imagination.

The slippery, dripping sounds; your character creeping through darkened vents and hallways w/ labored breaths; flickering lights and the remains of crew that you discover along the way; the monstrous abominations and wildlife you'll encounter while in the station and outside it (don't even get me started on the Abyss...my sleep will be troubled for many years thanks to that place); all this makes for one truly unforgettable experience.\n\nThe protagonist, Simon, is just an average joe w/ a head injury and thought he was going in for a revolutionary new scan of sorts that would increase his life expectany. Little did he know that it would work, though not in anyway he would have thought...he wakes up nearly 100 yrs later and that's when both the mystery and horror of the situation he finds himself in begins.  Now, armed with an Omnitool (why do I feel like all sci-fi games set in space or underwater always have one of these devices handy?) and the aid of Catherine, he'll unravel the shocking truth of the situation he has awoken to on the Pathos-II station.\n\nI can go on more about the plot but then I'd have to reveal dark/deep secrets that would ruin the experience for those that have yet to play this.\n\nIf you've ever wanted to explore the murky depths of the ocean while digging away at the complexity of the human psyche, then look no further.

SOMA is an experience that will stay with you for a long time after you finish it.\n\nFrom a horror standpoint, the gameplay is impeccable. There are enough monster encounters and tense chase sequences to keep the "Let's Play" crowd happy, but more importantly, the implications behind the scenes and the more subtle horror found deep within is something that I haven't experienced since beating Silent Hill 3 years ago.\n\nSOMA is definitely a 10/10 and my personal GOTY. It's the best horror game I have played since the aforementioned Silent Hill 3 (2003) which is a testament to what this game has done for the horror genre.

However, the monsters do play a part by adding up a certain amount of difficulty to keep players on their toes and also shed light into what happened before your arrival.\n\nAlso, for those who don't do well with the Frictional Games type of monsters, there is a mod in the workshop which allows the faint-hearted to play through the game without the enemies ever attacking you.\n\nAs for the plot, it explores various topics, some of which have already been treated in other games, and it's also the first videogame that I've seen represent an ASI in a way so close to what's actually possible .\n\nIt is truly a fantastic game which I'm pretty certain I'll play from beginning to end again.","December 22, 2015","true","24.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not only that, but it's part of a roller-coaster ride one would expect from a AAA game, by a "blank-check" kind of company.\n\nThe graphics? Detailed to the extreme. Combined with the (I herald) KING of sound design, with head-phones on and the lights out, you will be hard-pressed not to be sucked into this incredably dense atmosphere.\n\nGraphics? Check. Sound? Big Check. Story? Two bold checks. Controls? I played with a controller just fine--check.\n\nSo what's bad? Well, that would be the monst--no, you know what? I liked the monsters. As long as you take your time with them, be patient with them, you will work through them. Admittedly, there are portions where the monsters became a nuisance, but hell, they're supposed to be that way. Some of them are down right horrifying, but as long as you can figure out their "trick" they are very managable.\n\nSo, to anyone actually reading this: buy this game. Play this game.\n\nExperience. This. Game.","December 30, 2015","true","10.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The cold, lonely, dripping halls of the under water stations you will tromp about trying to get your bearrings are claustrophobic, horrifyingly lit and look like you've walked into everything right around the time Cthulu decided to get his lazy ♥♥♥ out of the bottom of the ocean and wreck the entirety of existence. The silence is deafening, forced to listen old transmissions of a hopeless world that is dead, and where you might honestly be the only sane man left.\n\nAs the game progresses, you will be presented with many, many moral choices. Though the dialogue is by no means tedious between the protagonist, and his pretty 'assistant' as we'll call her, they discuss a great deal on their concepts of what is life, what is death and what that means to the world around them. You set out in hopes of restoring this assistant's project dubbed the 'ARK', a artifical world where humanity's last dying hope may be to leave behind everything that is human, and take off as nothing but mere data on a little sattellite, roaming the cosmos for thousands of years.\n\nAs of the time I'm writing this review, I have not yet completed the game. The monsters are masterfully crafted, and every little groan, scream, or perturbed murmuring they make induces nothing but sheer panic. Their appearances are sheer terror, and thanks to the claustrophobia of the dimly lit halls of this station, you will be forced to make some very daring escapes, or cry in a corner while the monster howls at you. The moral choices I discussed are something I can't really reveal without being entirely heavy handed, but suffice to say, if you enjoy thinking and recieving inputs other than your own on the possibilities of 'what is life', you're sure to find yourself staring forlorn and frustrated as you're presented with someone else's life, in a 'what would I want if this was fair'. But none of it is fair.\n\nThe only negative comments I can make? Well, I'm not sure this engine has been properly stream-lined. It really lieks to eat up resources, and there are parts where I putter along with choppy graphics. The chatter between the protagonist, and 'assistant' are somewhat common place, and if you're looking at this title for the hopes of being utterly alone, I'm afraid you'll be disappointed. She likes to talk when there's no monsters around, and will be in your ear buzzing like a busy bee. But don't worry, if you don't mind the break from screaming and crying she never chirps up when there's real danger present. That, you get to face alone.\n\nA absolute classic for the horror genre. And thank God they hit the mark again, it seems the AMNESIA team quickly come to save the day before this genre becomes all hallway shooters with spooky scary zombie mutations.","November 2, 2015","true","13.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/coreman/recommended/282140/","coreman","Dragon Ranger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/coreman/","169 products in account","To this  day, I still regard Xenogears as my favorite game of all time. As a turn based JRPG from the late 90s, it not only delivers a solid, and creative spin to the gameplay, but the story is one of the best ever written, as a brilliant sci-fi masterpiece, centered on theology, psychology, history, science, morality, and humanity. Since the day I finished it, I have always held out hope for a video game to have a story which was as thought-provoking, and inspiring. But, despite some games which were excellently written, nothing ever seemed to quite reach that same level. The kind of story that you ponder over, weeks after finishing the story, still discovering new intricacies, and making you want to seek out theories, and summaries, and commentary. I honestly didn't believe I would find a story in a game, that would ever give me that feeling again.\nThen, I played SOMA.\nAfter hearing numerous people speak on it being a mind bender, and an interesting narrative, I decided it was worth a shot. I enjoyed Amnesia: The Dark Descent, and A Machine for Pigs, so I knew Frictional Games had a great sense for crafting engaging settings, and stories, as well as a real talent for tapping into territory to make the player feel unsettled, uneasy, and on edge. But going in, I never would have guessed they could create a game which tapped so significantly into deep human emotions, morality, and psychology, that it would invoke those same feelings I got from playing Xenogears, all over again.\nLike Xenogears, SOMA is still a solid game in the first-person survival horror genre. It has excellent area designs, amazing visuals, and amazing artwork, reminiscent of H.R. Geiger's biomechanical style. The enemies in this game are, for the most part, not overly grotesque. Rather, they are elegantly unnerving, and can cause just as much panic as any enemy in a survival horror game. As the type of game which is focused on the fleeing, and hiding, rather than open combat, this game has excellent pacing, as it has segments in between the threats. In short, you escape an area where an enemy is endlessly hunting for you, to reach an area where there may be some exposition, or a puzzle to solve, or environmental interaction. It breaks up the segments of suspense, and fear, with segments of wonder, or confusion, or character interaction. It makes the horror that much more engaging, because it is surprising when it happens. You don't just run into one enemy after another.\nThe best way I can describe the experience is the gameplay of Amnesia, meets 2001: A Space Odysey, in the world of a cross between Bioshock and Alien. The world of SOMA is absolutely phenomenal. I don't hesitate to say it is one of the best games I have ever played, and without a doubt, an incredibly thought-provoking experience. I will admit that it may not be for everyone.  If you are looking for a more horror-focused game, you would probably be better playing Amnesia, Outlast, or Alien: Isolation. If you particularly interested in story-driven games, SOMA might not be entirely out of the question for you to try, but there is a good deal of story, and dialogue in the game. Ultimately, if you are on the fence about this game, or are a horror game fan looking for something different, or running low on quality horror games to play, I can say that SOMA is definitely worth a shot. Above all else, when you go in, it's best to not know what to expect. For me, it turned SOMA into an instant favorite, an unforgettable game, and a modern classic.","March 6","true","17.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a sci-fi horror game that stays true to the roots of Amnesia: The Dark Descent. The distinguishing feature in this game is that it explores very deep and profound ideas concerning humanity.\n\nThe most noticable thing right off the bat is that the new HPL engine is very good. The graphics, sound, behavior, etc are all a huge step up from previous Frictional titles, while it also keeps the trademark mechanics of environment interaction. All in all, this results in the game being incredibly immersive.\n\nThe plot is the most interesting that I've ever experienced in a Frictional title. It's not a cliche horror plot of escaping a castle from some monsters or whatever. In the beginning, you'll play as a man named Simon that got in a car accident, who has then volunteered to undergo an experiment that involves getting his brain scanned before he wakes up in an underwater city. From there, you learn more about what has gone on since your recent memory, the future, and what happened at the station. Most of the plot stems from the idea that science has advanced us enough that the technology to scan brains and to reanimate dead muscles/systems exists, which, of course, results in people going crazy, some zombie sort of creatures, and the general running amok. From then on, you'll be breached with the ideas of who you are, what you're doing, the impact of the technology on the world, and even reality itself.\n\nThe exploration is fairly linear, as usual. There are a lot of things that you can explore and the fine details of the environment are all present to the standard of your modern RPGs. One of the main drawbacks of the game was that I felt like the monsters were so annoying that they broke immersion. Sometimes, it took immense concentration to get past a monster (especially the last one), and it completely broke the flow of the game. If the game wasn't so enriching and immersive in the first place, these monsters might not have made the contrast so sharp. Regardless, there is a mod on the steam workshop called "wuss mode" that I highly recommend using during your 2nd playthrough so that you can pick up on more finer details that you will have certainly missed the first time.\n\nDuring the game, you'll be constantly presented with gray areas about what's right and wrong in certain ethical situations. If you have the ability to bring up a simulation of a dead man, are you actually doing things to him? Does he remember them? What would you do if you ever met your clone? If someone is cloned and one of the people die, is that person dead or is the clone alive? Are you simply putting people out of their misery with that? Is there some intrinsic, yet unique, right that a person has to not get copied to a hard drive?\n\nSOMA was one of the few games that I instantly purchased and played when it was released. I had been won over as a fan of Frictional from their previous titles and the ideas/plot to this game were perfect for my taste. Hope you're ready for low action, deep thinking, and scary hallways.","February 21","true","11.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Top notch horror. An exploration of the role of artificial vs human intelligence. The world evolves in a constant turning of events with you slowly uncovering your place in it. There were scenes that had me sitting back to consider what I just witnessed. Others had me afraid to blink. Dialog is super, too. The characters often echoed my own thoughts on the current situation.\n\nGameplay is pretty streamlined compared to previous Frictional games: no inventory or tools, puzzles are simplistic (without feeling like an afterthought), but the experience overall definitely benefits from this. It lets you concentrate on the story, which is much more coherent (as it should be, but it still takes a bit of focus to piece everything together, considering how many characters you are introduced to and how few of them you interact with).\n\nAlthough I can understand people wanting a low cost per hour of gameplay, I thought the length was perfect for a game like this. It lets you hold the whole thing in your mind without parts of it fading.\n\nSound design is the real stand-out here, I'd say. Really helps the narrative: beautiful coupling with the environments. It had me cowering in various corners sure that the monster was in the room with me (of course maybe it wasn't).\n\nIf you haven't played any other game by Frictional, this is all you need. It'll be hard to top. If you haven't played any horror-survival, also start here. It would be a waste of time not to play this one.\n\np.s.

You know those games, where there's audio recordings and notes lying about the place, and you're like "Nyegh, I guess I gotta read this to understand the plot"? Well, in SOMA, I was scouring every single surface so that I wouldn't miss anything - even in one of those sections where the monster is just relentlessly coming for you, I'd still try to shake it off and then sneak through every room, using a map that I took a screenshot of, to make sure I wasn't missing anything, In other words, the story is so engaging that I made sure to find everything and figure out as much as possible before it was explicitly presented. It's a great story, and I feel sorry for those who don't want to play horror games because they're missing out.","December 29, 2015","true","18.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Got a few flaws, problems with the way some opponents are handled throughout the game, but only merely a problem at all. The strengh of this game is its theme, the story and the way it is told to the player. SOMA gracefully walks through major sci fi plots, nailing the writing at multiple times, and brings wonderful discourses on... things I shouldn't talk about. It would spoil :)\n\nThe game itself isn't much of a challenge, this is mainly a sci fi story that you walk along with in a 3D world. Sometimes you will face opposition, but it's not enough to think of it as a "challenge". It's not even the core gameplay. Also the game is kinda scary, stressing really, and often gruesome, but not in excess I believe.\n\nI can't say I'm proud that I've beat the game (nothing to be proud of :) ) but I most certainly loved the journey.","January 10","true","8.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Top notch horror. An exploration of the role of artificial vs human intelligence. The world evolves in a constant turning of events with you slowly uncovering your place in it. There were scenes that had me sitting back to consider what I just witnessed. Others had me afraid to blink. Dialog is super, too. The characters often echoed my own thoughts on the current situation.\n\nGameplay is pretty streamlined compared to previous Frictional games: no inventory or tools, puzzles are simplistic (without feeling like an afterthought), but the experience overall definitely benefits from this. It lets you concentrate on the story, which is much more coherent (as it should be, but it still takes a bit of focus to piece everything together, considering how many characters you are introduced to and how few of them you interact with).\n\nAlthough I can understand people wanting a low cost per hour of gameplay, I thought the length was perfect for a game like this. It lets you hold the whole thing in your mind without parts of it fading.\n\nSound design is the real stand-out here, I'd say. Really helps the narrative: beautiful coupling with the environments. It had me cowering in various corners sure that the monster was in the room with me (of course maybe it wasn't).\n\nIf you haven't played any other game by Frictional, this is all you need. It'll be hard to top. If you haven't played any horror-survival, also start here. It would be a waste of time not to play this one.\n\np.s.

Here are my thoughts. :)\n\nI think my point of view may be unpopular with this title(even though I recommend it) because I really enjoyed SOMA a lot more than the previous games produced by Frictional. I still enjoyed A:DD and A:MFP in their own way, but I was never able to complete them since I stubbornly refuse the guidance of a walkthrough. :P\n\nThat being said, this is a game that I enjoy more with each new playthrough so far. I find new things and notice different nuances in the dialogue that I previously hadn't. I didn't encounter any bugs on either playthrough and found the performance to be pretty good on my mid-tier rig with high settings.\n\nThe story was amazing for me as it took me down a path that I hadn't travelled before which in turn had me exploring thoughts that I hadn't had before. Though to be honest, the main character(Simon) struggled a bit more with some of the 'moral' choices he needed to make than I did. At times he would lament a choice so strongly that I would feel bad only because it made him sad. When you're in a survival situation, you don't always have the luxury of being able to keep everybody happy unfortunately.\n\nAnywho, I recommend this game for multiple playthroughs. If you're a fan of spooky exploration and an interesting story, this is a game for you.  If you have a problem with games where you don't get instant gratification or you race through games ignoring all the important plot points, this is NOT the game for you.","February 14","true","18.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Won't say more then that, but that is really the driving force behind this game.\n\nAs for the rest it has a very interesting environment, very much alike the one in Bioshock with an underwater base or the space station in System Shock. The gameplay is nothing special though, and I was not a huge fan of there being enemies in the game as I did not really feel they brought any really interesting mechanic or gameplay with them. I think the story and atmosphere where enough without these mechanics in the current format. In the case of going for more gamplay I would have loved a bit more freedom with a more coherent base, like in System Shock, instead of a more segmented route where you are in area A for a while, then go to area B and then on to C etc. But this game is much more focused, especially on its story, and that is totally fine since it is such a fine story.\n\nAlso I could not stop thinking about how amazing this game would be in VR. Both for the atmosphere, experience, and the actual theme of the game, it would just be totally mindbogglingly good and would fit perfectly with everything this game is, and I could easy see that being one of the best fictional experiences you could get anywhere if done right.","December 5, 2015","true","9.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Top notch horror. An exploration of the role of artificial vs human intelligence. The world evolves in a constant turning of events with you slowly uncovering your place in it. There were scenes that had me sitting back to consider what I just witnessed. Others had me afraid to blink. Dialog is super, too. The characters often echoed my own thoughts on the current situation.\n\nGameplay is pretty streamlined compared to previous Frictional games: no inventory or tools, puzzles are simplistic (without feeling like an afterthought), but the experience overall definitely benefits from this. It lets you concentrate on the story, which is much more coherent (as it should be, but it still takes a bit of focus to piece everything together, considering how many characters you are introduced to and how few of them you interact with).\n\nAlthough I can understand people wanting a low cost per hour of gameplay, I thought the length was perfect for a game like this. It lets you hold the whole thing in your mind without parts of it fading.\n\nSound design is the real stand-out here, I'd say. Really helps the narrative: beautiful coupling with the environments. It had me cowering in various corners sure that the monster was in the room with me (of course maybe it wasn't).\n\nIf you haven't played any other game by Frictional, this is all you need. It'll be hard to top. If you haven't played any horror-survival, also start here. It would be a waste of time not to play this one.\n\np.s.

Got a few flaws, problems with the way some opponents are handled throughout the game, but only merely a problem at all. The strengh of this game is its theme, the story and the way it is told to the player. SOMA gracefully walks through major sci fi plots, nailing the writing at multiple times, and brings wonderful discourses on... things I shouldn't talk about. It would spoil :)\n\nThe game itself isn't much of a challenge, this is mainly a sci fi story that you walk along with in a 3D world. Sometimes you will face opposition, but it's not enough to think of it as a "challenge". It's not even the core gameplay. Also the game is kinda scary, stressing really, and often gruesome, but not in excess I believe.\n\nI can't say I'm proud that I've beat the game (nothing to be proud of :) ) but I most certainly loved the journey.","January 10","true","8.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So first off Graphics are not too hot; as was playing it I was wondering what they could been able to do with a AAA budget.  For whatever they had to work with the game really comes through. It’s a fleshed out world and you are immersed in the 10 to 12-hour experience. The A.I is not the best either.  I took my time crouching metal gear solid style and I never had any problems walking through the levels.   The scares are here but it’s not that frightening.  What propels you through this game is its amazing story.  I never had a game really push me to my edge in morality what I thought was wrong or right.  What is life?  The more I played the game the more I cared about the characters and like them.  I had a lot of, “what would I really do in this situation.”  That something I love about games and this game does it so well. This is one of the best cohesive stories.  It hits close to home.  If you like horror, then I recommend this to you it’s not the scariest game you will play. But, after its all over you will truly enjoy your overall experience.","October 4, 2015","true","13.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/harvonyx/recommended/282140/","harvonyx","HarvOnyx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/harvonyx/","100 products in account","An incredibly immersive experience with many emotional twists.\n\nA master crafted atmosphere which manages to be spine chilling and intriguing at the same time. Many times I was looking in rooms and cupboards where I know for a fact won't get me any rewards but was so interesting anyway. In particular you spend time down in the deep ocean where the atmosphere is tense even in open and well lit spaces.\n\nThe concept of chase music and shaking screens from Amnesia have been replicated in a more futuristic way with screen distortion and static. This (like Amnesia) builds a truly hound racing atmosphere when the player is being chased. Though some enemies are easier to evade than others.\n\nSimple things such as door buttons being almost randomly placed on different doors make the game that bit more of a challenge. Running away and closing doors is not always and option and will often at times leave you in a worse standpoint than before. If you're going to play the game I would recomend leaving doors open and hitting the close button as you pass through them and not after you've done so, Doors are often slow to close and luckily won't chop you up.\n\nAn amazing physics engine that makes throwing objects and breaking glass a satisfying feeling.\n\nA variety of different monsters to evade unlike Amnesia and the grunts/brutes.\n\nThe underwater scenes provide a break to the heart pounding chase seens and terrifying hallways giving you a breather and never making you feel forced into continuing on.\n\nThere are very few friendly NPCs you can meet but each one serves a vital purpose and will accompany you in fitting ways.\n\nThe storyline is harsh but realistic depiction of transfering minds between bodies and machinery and giving us a fresh outlook on the 'philosophical zombie'.\n\nIf you're a fan of horror games SOMA will tick all your boxes. For me personally I love the idea of underwater high tech facilities and artificial intelligence, so naturally accompanying this with sea monsters and a particularly lovable main protagonist and I am a happy bunny indeed.\n\nThe main character is your run of the mill city worker living a basic life that does/does not take a turn for the worst whilst still holding intergrety and realism. There are no reality breaking plot twists and most of the storyline is explained in detail throughout the game.\n\nThough your choices in the game don't particularly effect the outcome of the game they do pose significant emotional impacts with each choice being difficult to decide upon. A lot of the time a choice isn't even visible and you will have to go out of your way to find an alternate outcome.\n\nIn conclusion I would recomend this game to anyone who takes an interest in science fiction and horror. Maybe also if you liked the 1989 move The Abyss and thought it would be improved by giant sea monsters and killer robot zombies.

A lot of developers have tried this kind of storytelling, but none have really succeeded, until SOMA came along. You learn about the world and it's amazing story through emails, status reports, flashback-ish conversations, through items and props on the floor or in desks or whatever, pictures and drawings laying around. It's all very subtle, but still ingenious and structured.\n\nIt's not AS scary as Amnesia was, but that's a good thing. The spoopy sections in this game are structured in a way you can still progress through the game without literally having multiple heart-attacks, except this one time. I had a lot of fun just exploring and finding subtle things that hint the story, without constantly having to fear incoming beasts.\n\nThat said, the atmosphere is chilling, but in a weird way comforting. It keeps you on your toes at all times, while granting you the will to push on and delve deeper into the abyss.\n\nI personally believe this is one of the best horror games ever made. It's wonderfully balanced, and while you will be on the edge of your seat the whole time throughout, you will constantly be empowered to unravel the mystery that lays on the ocean floor.","October 2, 2015","true","13.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is the sort of game that you should not know anything, ANYTHING about it before playing, so take my word and everyone elses word to just trust us, and play it. It's not greatly long; I finished it in about ~14 hours I think and that was a little rushed, but it is gripping, it is moderatly scary (there are some great atmospheric jump scares and psychological horror scenes that are a must play), it has an insane story that - whilst linear - can be played again no doubt, and its made by a respectable company with great story tellers, immersive graphics and sound (good headphones or decent home theatre sound system advised) and all round excellent game play. It doesn't have the mechanics most games have now a days where they fill out time with stupid collecting puzzles or frustrating scenes where you wait for a light to turn ♥♥♥♥ing blue or whatever. They've taken mediocre game concepts that have been around for a little while and turn it into something new and sometimes unexpected, and certainly engaging. There's not a lot else I can really say that won't spoil anything, but still give you an accurate representation of what the game is like. Basically, set aside a day on the weekend or whatever, settle down with no distractions, and play the ♥♥♥♥ out of it. It is a really good game.

Here's a link to the video review, followed by the text if you prefer reading it.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/icyeWN5zBqA\n\nSOMA is a follow up to the incredible success that was Amnesia: The Dark Descent.  It’s a first person sci-fi horror game in which the player has no weapons and must use their wits to avoid the dangers of the deep.\n\nThe title was developed and published by Frictional Games.  It released on Steam, GOG and the Humble Store for Windows, Mac and Linux on September 21st and digitally on the PS4 on September 22nd with a stock standard price of $30 US.\n\nYou play as Simon, just a guy going in for a medical scan who wakes up in a weird place, trying to make sense of his surroundings and as it turns out, himself.\n\nI got a review copy of SOMA and decided that for the first time, I’d give a horror game a try.  I’m not a horror genre fan and don’t particularly like horror movies either, so take that into account while watching this.\n\n\nGameplay\nSOMA plays like just about every first person shooter that has ever been released.  WASD for movement, mouse to look, space for jumping and a few interactable items.  It does have a Skyrim style item pick up system in that you can move a lot of random objects around the world including some interactivity with the world but in general, this feels a bit gimmicky.  For example, early in the game you get to throw an object at a window to break it.  Don’t expect that mechanic to be useful again for a while.  Several mechanics are similarly used very infrequently.\n\nI was expecting a horror game though, not a psychological thriller.  And while I don’t want that to count against it, the altered design from what I expected also had a fairly negative piece as well.\n\nSOMA is very good at telling the story of a derelict settlement of sorts, but it does it with large expanses of walking.  Walking and walking.  More walking.  Enough so, that I honestly believe that I spent at least half my time playing the game, walking from one place to the next.  Sure, some of it is slow, very heavily atmospheric walking with terror lurking behind every shadow, but its’ still long expanses of uneventful walking nonetheless.\n\nWhere it comes to the actual horror part, you go for long enough in between creatures that there is still surprise when it happens, but that fear goes away fairly quickly watching them, or not watching as the situation dictates.  I found the primary source of nerve wracking to be the world design, location and what was once there, rather than what is there now.\n\n\nGraphical Quality\nThis is a beautiful game.  Without spoiling too much of anything, the scenery is gorgeous, with plenty of nuanced item placements and creative designs.  Further to that, there are a significant number of underwater portions which, given the nice lighting will awaken -thalassophobia in any player.\n\nThe atmosphere of the game is enhanced by the graphical fidelity and the performance is very good as well.  There were some issues recording with DXTory though, with the framerate dropping to a fixed 30FPS, but outside of that, it was a solid 60.  It has all of the graphical options you would expect and yay for being able to turn off bloom.\n\n\nSummary\nI felt like this review would be a bit longer than it is, but that’s a function of a significant portion of SOMA being good, but not great or bad.  For me it was a bug free experience.  The graphics are gorgeous and the setting terrifying but when it comes to actual game inhabitants, and the patterns they follow, the game fell short for me.  The gameplay is not revolutionary or even evolutionary in any way.  The storyline is brilliantly told, for the most part with intricate and easily missed objects in the world that add to the overall presentation, but it has so much walking simulator filler that I frequently found myself wishing I could just skip to the next piece of story.\n\nIt’s a good solid game, but not exceptional.  And I found myself expecting more from a developer with such a critically acclaimed success as Amnesia.\n\n\nRating7 out of 10","October 18, 2015","true","25.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/magusx777/recommended/282140/","magusx777","[KoS]DarkProphet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/magusx777/","568 products in account","Wow. Just finished the game, and boy is has to be the darkest game I've ever played. No, I don't mean literally dark like Doom 3, but rather, dark in terms of premise and storyline. I don't want to say much about the plot because it is the key draw for playing the game. Everything else ranges from "meh" in quality to pretty decent, while the ideas behind the plot are an 11/10, and the plot itself is good enough. The only gripes I really have about the storyline are concerning named characters, because there are a lot of names getting dropped in recordings you'll hear, and it's hard to keep up with who is who or what certain characters did and why. To make matters worse, sometimes it was difficult to understand some of the voices in recordings, which certainly didn't help with the mess.\n\nThe gameplay was alright. If this game didn't have the plot and philosophical shenanigans going on that it does, I probably wouldn't have finished it because the actual gameplay is pretty so-so. You walk around a bunch, interact with equipment, solve a small number of puzzles, and do stealth stuff. I love stealth, and this game has some of the worst stealth I've ever seen in a game. Most of the time, you just crouch, look away from the enemy, and sit perfectly still...even in bright light while it's looking right at you, and the things just waddle away like idiots. They are very annoying and I never enjoyed this element of the game despite having been a fan of Alien Isolation; another first person game where you hide from but don't fight a monster. Actually playing the game just wasn't fun for me. It was all about the story, character interactions, and philosophical questions that get brought up.\n\nThe game took me about ten hours to complete, which was long enough. I would've been fine if it'd ended a couple of hours sooner, but it didn't outstay its welcome to the extent that the aforementioned Alien Isolation did for me. I was ready for this game to end, and before to much longer, it ended. The story and philosophical matters are quite dark and twisted. Maybe it has a terrible ending; maybe a happy one? I shan't spoil it, but there is certainly dark stuff about...oh, and do watch after the credits.\n\nIf you enjoy really thinking about things and sci-fi existence/humanity "stuff," and a pretty good storyline, you'll likely get something you'll like out of this game. It's not great or an absolute must-play for most people, but my curiosity was gnawing at me and I just had to see this game for myself.\n\nIn closing, I would like to point out that if you think you guessed a big plot twist from the trailer, the thing you think is a massive plot twist is just an early-game twist that is hinted at and built up to, revealed within the first couple of hours. I assure you there's much more interesting stuff going on than just that one twist the trailer pretty much gives away. It's just the groundwork for the philosophy I spoke of. I know I'm being cryptic about the plot, but honestly, there's not much other reason to play this game than for the story/character/philosophy aspects.","May 26","true","10.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its eerie sense of dread stuck out to me-- the battle between helplessness and control, which is then toppled with a reminder of the ultimate insignificance of your every move and thought due to their artificial origin. How much of the self is important to the self, and why? Very intricate, dark, and poetically-themed game. While only some of the visuals are frightening and disarming, the music and sound effects made my skin crawl. To me, what makes this a "horror game" is the doom-setting, the (what most would consider) morally-reprehensible decisions you must make to advance the game (such as unplugging humans on life support to divert the limited flow of power)-- but most of all, watching the average-Joe main character's slow and painful breakdown battle his will to survive beneath the crushing weight of the existential-doom-meets-identity-crisis he faces. Even if you yourself are comfortable with such concepts, it's easy to get inside the head of this conventional-minded adult male and empathize with his fear as he discovers everything he knew is in ruins.","May 18","true","14.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/joachim18/recommended/282140/","joachim18","Joachim","http://steamcommunity.com/id/joachim18/","802 products in account","SOMA is a game exploring through virtual interactivity what it means to be alive. Is it about freedom or is it about restriction ? No matter what you believe the game will twist those long lived dilemas with a convincing sci fi plot full of details about robotics, AI and the human brain. The game plays like a video game version of a Philip K. ♥♥♥♥ short novels, where the feeling of existential despair mixed with some cynical humour bends what your concept of reality is. The voice acting is especially great, and fleshes the character interactions out in a very convincing and pleasing way, especially considering how terrifying the game can be, you will appreciate every little word told.\n\nBut the game isn't only about interacting with a narrative inside a confined environment. This game is about mustering your courage to go on despite weird creatures lurking just around the corner. You can't just sit there and wait until the monsters disappear, because they won't, you have to get out and find a way around them. There are times I wanted to quit the game, uninstall it and never think about it ever again because of the terror I felt wandering through the dark, damp, twisted underwater corridors with unspeakable horrors at my heels. But the game is well designed, it makes you terrified but it doesn't frustrate you: death or being stuck is a rare occurence. The game manage to make you feel lost and desperate, yet you will always end up finding your way and reaching some "safer" haven to recollect your wits and breath.\n\nNothing beats the feeling of finishing a particularly terrifying section of the game. You always get rewarded for your courage by involved conversations, tidbits of informations, some interactions with machineries or computers and new goals that will give you back all the strength you used up. The plot and overall design of the game are so tight and well made, you will want to both flee and go on forward in equal measure. I can safely say this is my favorite horror game.","October 22, 2015","true","14.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Nice philosophical sci-fi-horror with a good story and some truly scary moments. Similarly to Amnesia you can't use weapons, but the enviroment is nicely interactive and explorable.  Many audio logs, photos and other small snippets that are not necessary to the main story, but help to create a more fleshed out world.","September 23, 2015","true","12.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

One of the most immersive experiences I've played in a long while. Not as terrifying as Amnesia, that's not to say it isn't scary. There's plenty of moments where your ♥♥♥♥ will be chewing your seat, and generally the whole experience from start to end, kept me tense and on edge, but the fact that it doesn't drown you and smother you with an unnerving atmosphere is a good thing, there's such a thing as too much and I think Frictional nailed it.\nWorth the pennies.\n\n","September 23, 2015","true","13.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
