"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cadillacfury/recommended/422970/","cadillacfury","Drake","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cadillacfury/","1486 products in account","Possibly the most elegant FPS devised. Every element serves a purpose. From the scraping dry laughter to the red glint of gems. Devil Daggers is lo-fi poetry in motion.\n\nThe eponymous weapon combines doom 2's double barrel shotgun and Hyperblaster into a single devstating instrument of death. The movement system is straight out of Doom, Quake and Painkiller. Strafe running, strafe jumping, bunny hopping, it's all there. But don't let that speed go to your head. While you can accelerate faster, the enemy has higher top speeds. But their swarms cannot turn as fast. The demonic swarm also has exploitable behaviors, notably they will try to avoid your daggers. This allows you to carve paths of destruction, splitting the demonic hordes as you punch through. With sharp target prioritization, skillful shooting and the grace of a satanic, bullfighting ballerina you can eke out extra seconds of life as you climb the leaderboards. And speaking of the leaderboards, they have a wonderful demo feature. Every scoring run is recorded. Probably the best anti-cheat feature possible for a leaderboard, as well as a wealth of information and techniques.\n\nSure to fall flat with the cinematic shooter crowd, this is a love letter to ID's glory days, right down to the gritty textures of the low poly models and the palettes that color them. There is no story to tell or goal to achieve except the tale of your own mastery. A total emphasis on skill, no margin for error and absolutely zero downtime (even death holds no loading screens) is this game's hallmark. Devil Daggers demands nothing less than your total attention, and while razor sharp reflexes will serve you well, you need to have an even sharper grasp of position and target priority. Hell has many lessons to teach. It communicates so well there is no need for a HUD. All the information you require is in the motion of your enemy, the sound of bone scraping on stone, your own momentum as you strafe the edges of this platform suspended in the void.\n\nDevil Daggers is a purposeful distillation of what made the greats so compelling.","February 22","true","5.3"," 194 of 213 people (91%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","91","194","213","6","1"

I can still feel my pulse in my fingertips, though, reminding me of my last sudden fatality by laughing skull. It's the most recent death of many, sometimes brought on by nerves, sometimes by hesitation, and sometimes by arrogance. There aren't many ways to die in the game, but a lot of reasons why, enough to keep the cycle of death and more death fresh for hours.\n\nDevil Daggers is an arena FPS pitting you and your titular daggers against a yawning void of bloodthirsty skulls. Every attempt sees your enemies spawning in waves, a host of flying skulls, laughing skulls, spider skulls, serpent skulls, and worse. Your only defenses are your Quake-like reflexes and your daggers, fired in either a chaotic stream or a shotgun-like blast. Both attacks see a lot of use in culling the horde, either hosing down dense groups or sniping troublesome skulls.\n\nLarger enemies drop gems that can upgrade your attacks, but you can only attract them when you're not shooting. Furthermore, there are enemies that will happily hoover up your gems, delaying your vital upgrades. It's a small detail but one that adds a significant layer of strategy to the game. You'll die plenty trying to master it, though, as the end is only a single skull touch away. The learning curve is significant but there is one, because enemies always spawn in at the same times each round, just in different places.\n\nAll of this is wrapped in a deliciously chunky retro-3D package that evokes the best parts of early shooters. I know some people call the original Quake ugly but it had a grim, nightmarish quality to its software polygons that Devil Daggers makes the most of. The sound design deserves special mention as well, hitting you with dark rumblings, menacing synth, and quad-damage-style stingers in the heat of battle. Each of your foes has their own cues, from the coconut-like clatter of basic skulls to the spiderleg-tapping of enormous skittering horrors. The persistent audio assault coupled with the dark, pixel-blurred creatures lunging at you from all angles makes every round a little panic attack of demonic portend.\n\nThere are global and friend leaderboards to compare scores on, so you'll get the most out of the game if you have folks to chase after. The only criticism I can really level against Devil Daggers is that that's it. There's no story, no multiplayer, no other modes or permutations other than that one harrowing arena. Hopefully you understand at this point that the combat, enemy, and aesthetic designs make this more than worth your time, because you'll find few rushes in the gaming world like Devil Daggers.","March 1","true","1.8"," 81 of 89 people (91%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","91","81","89","6","1"

Combined with the fantastic sound design this art style helps create a very tense atmosphere.\nThe controls are tight and will be instantly familiar to anyone who has played these shooters of old. The game also includes competitive leaderboards, and lets you view other players attempts, allowing you to learn from their tactics and mistakes.\n\nThese factors combine perfectly into a cohesive game that is more than just the sum of its parts. Devil Daggers is a beautiful looking and sounding game, thanks to its art and sound design. Yet Devil Daggers is also an incredibly addictive highscore attack game thanks to its gameplay and leaderboards features.\n\nThis explains why I think Devil Daggers is pretty much a perfect game. It is a very focused game and it executes its design perfectly. Devil Daggers doesn’t try to be huge or varied. It simply tries to be a stylish, addictive survival shooter and it succeeds in every way.\n\nIf you like difficult high score attack games like Super Hexagon at all, or are nostalgic for shooter such as Quake you need to buy this game right now. You won’t regret it.","February 21","true","2.8"," 96 of 116 people (83%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","83","96","116","5","1"

Absolutely blew me away.\n\nFirst of all, especially given the price point, YES, it's worth your investment. Think of this game as mixture of Unreal Tournament, Doom, Magic Carpet, and Geometry Wars. The intensity, addictive quality, and horror are all top-notch. Of particular note is the SOUND DESIGN and direction. I'm an extremely jaded survival horror fan, and it's tough to impress me with audio - or scare me with it, given that I'm a noise musician in my spare time - but the relentless, terrifying soundscape that this game includes grates on you and psychologically fatigues you in the best possible way.\n\nIt's truly a refreshing experience and a ton of fun. A brutal challenge but sooooo worth the money.\n\nNow, DEVS: If you're reading this, I think you have an amazing formula here and I hope you expand on it. I could see this functioning very well as a stand alone title. Part of what makes it so unique and cool is that it's not bloated with a million additional add-ons, and seems like a genuine labor of love. Another reviewer described it as a nearly perfect game, and I agree. HOWEVER, I'm concerned with the game's longevity. I would appreciate a few power-ups and/or additional weapons along the way. Maybe a minimalized system like Binding of Isaac's character selection, where you can eventually unlock some different abilities or something like that. I would totally respect you if you disagreed with that opinion - in fact, I would admire your commitment to your aesthetic! However, that might be the difference between me playing this game for 5 hours or for 50 hours.\n\nUltimately, I'm glad this game exists. I very much hope you will entertain the possibility of making a sequel or some DLC to expand on the ideas you have. You have an incredibly solid foundation and I hope to see it grow. Then again, if it doesn't, I'll love it all the same.\n\nIn fact, I like the game so much I would be happy to volunteer to work on it. Not that you guys need the help, but if you're willing to point me in the direction of a way to mod the game, I'd be happy to prototype some features - I have some experience with game design and coding. I guess what I'm saying is... this game gets me excited about making and playing games! I hope that serves as a compliment - it's certainly intended as such!","February 21","true","5.5"," 40 of 47 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","40","47","3","0"

Infact that's the real goal. To survive as long as possible.\n\nThe mechanics are pretty simple. You can shoot a stream of "devil daggers" or tap your shoot key for a shotgun-like burst. You can also collect red jewels as you kill larger enemies to improve your devil daggers' strength. It's all about micromanaging your spatial awareness, and priority in what to kill.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgq7yKxj4tw\nThough the premise is simple enough, the challenge is incredibly high. You'll get overwhelmed with enemies very quickly if you're not careful. Surviving for longer than a minute per round is a true achievement. There is an addictive value to the game's design loop with "one more game" as the initiative to replay over and over again.\n\nThe game's visuals are striking and stylized. With an eerie Gothic horror look, rendered in a pixel-3D aesthetic. The sound design is disturbing and compliment it's visuals quite well. It presents a moody atmosphere that drew me in.\n\nThe game can certainly be considered repetitive, and with only one mode to play it dosn't help it's repetition. After playing just a few rounds I quickly understood why the game was so cheap at $5.00 USD. There really isn't much content here. Luckily for us, what is here is addictive, challenging, and satasfying.\n\nOverall, Devil Daggers is a cheap, grotesquely gorgeous endless shooter that is well suited for score attackers. It's short on content, but makes it up an addictive designed gameplay loop.\n\nPros:\n- Atmospheric visual and sound design\n- Incredibly challenging\n- Very addictive\n- Appropriate price tag\n\nCons:\n- Short on content\n- Might not be for everyone\n\n► Devil Daggers hours played: 2\n► Completion Status on Devil Daggers: N/A\n► This copy of Devil Daggers provided by the developers","February 20","true","2.6"," 30 of 39 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","30","39","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheIronicGamer/recommended/422970/","TheIronicGamer","TheIronicGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheIronicGamer/","1545 products in account","I was provided this game for free by the developer to make the review but it in no way alters my opinion on the game\nMy initial thoughts with playing devil daggers was there's no way i'm gonna enjoy this game. I thought I was going to get bored of it so quickly with the lack of content. However the lack of content strangely ends up being the games strongest selling point.\n\nDevil daggers is an arena based survival game of ridiculously hard proportions. Only one arena is present in the game and no variations of it exist. For most games this would earn it an immediate not recommended status in my review. But devil daggers is made to perfection in a way to get you always wanting more and to never give up on trying to beat your highscore. It has a huge amount of replayability despite what initially might seem like a flaw in the design.\n\nIt features some of the most satisfying combat I have seen in a video game to date. You are only presented with one weapon and no option to change. Despite the games title suggests your weapon is most definitely not a dagger. Your weapon is instead a gun that has 2 shooting abilities. The first option is a rapid fire mode that fires a barrage of bullets ahead of you. The second option is a shotgun like mode that fires a spray of bullets around the immediate area. This variation of fire modes is very useful when trying to avoid enemies and will help you get out of the worst situations.\n\nThe enemies in devil daggers is what makes it particularly difficult. Many are flying enemies that ruthessly follow you. This requires you to use expert tactics to avoid certain enemies while also shooting at others. Most enemies become faster than you as well meaning running away without killing is not an option. There is a great enemy variety in the game meaning each presents a different challenge to kill. The weak spots on each enemy are always obvious though being usually presented in a bright glowing light. The further you survive in the game the harder the enemies get.\n\nRuthlessly hard difficulty is what makes devil daggers particularly addicting. You will struggle to survive even 60 seconds in the arena. One hit from any enemy and you are immediately dead and you have to start again. The exact spawning locations of the enemies changes each game you play but the timing of when each enemy spawns is approximately constant thoughout each playthrough. So it is possible to learn certain patterns to help you in future playthroughs.\n\nThe games leaderboard system is what makes you want to keep playing and beat all your friends scores. Really the only score that exists is how long you manage to survive for which is given to a high precision of 4 decimal places. As of writing this review the highest scoring person survived for ~612 seconds. I have only survived a pitiful 60 seconds. The game features seperate world and friends leaderboards. So if you don't feel like your good enough to challenge the world then just challenge your own friends runs. Every leaderboard run is also saved so you can watch any run take place from start to finish. This is a fantastic extra feature to help you learn key survival techniques or just marvel at the skill of others.\n\nPixel art graphic styles are a personal favourite for me and I am always attracted to games featuring them when done well. Devil daggers is something of perfection in the art style. Bright colours, beautifully created unique looking characters and amazing animations really bring the game to life. Each enemy really has the devilish look that I expect. I honestly couldn't come up with a single complaint about the art style if I tried.\n\nSound design in devil daggers is also extremely good. Each enemy has it's own unique sound. All give off the signature devlish vibe that I expected. From squeels to screams or even the sound of spiders, the sound design is really perfect. The complaint I would have about sound though is the game has no music anywhere in it. I feel like music would make the game slightly more appealing for the long term. I mean it doesn't even have menu music which would be a very nice addition.\n\nOverall devil daggers is a small simple game that has a suprise amount of depth and replayability to it. It is one that I will definitely be coming back to often to try and beat mine and friends times. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of score attack or survival type games. The price of £3.99 is a really reasonable price to ask for.\n\nTheIronicGamers rating system\nDon't ever buy this game.\nMaybe consider it on a sale.\nAn average game.\nA good game that should definitely be considered.\nA must play!\nFor more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's group curations here!\n","March 14","true","2.1"," 23 of 29 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","23","29","3","0"

It's about improving your skills as far as possible to get success. Skills means aiming and moving but most important is to get a feeling of the enemies behaviour, their movement patterns. Very important as well is the knowledge of the chronology of the enemies appearance. And always stay alert for the noises and keep dancing with the creatures of hell!\nThe stimulus is that you can excperience your growing skills by seeing your increasing survival time. Even though you have to die many deaths to get success the good thing is that it does not take hours but only minutes to get the chance for a new highscore.\n\nOnly thing I miss is some more stats and rankings, e.g. total kills, dies, hit ratio etc. Some more achievements would have been nice as well.","May 3","true","105.6"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","17","20","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zztx/recommended/422970/","zztx","ZZT-X","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zztx/","361 products in account","Robotron 2084 and Quake had an unholy union and produced a game Zdzislaw Beksinski would call beautiful.\n\nYou're a guy/gal in a small, dark arena with a glowing hand that shoots daggers, either in a steady, rapid stream or a shotgun-like blast (there's also homing daggers, but that's later). All around you are flying skulls, spider skulls, worm skulls, and more skulls. Destroy them in an effort to last as long as possible - high scores are measured in seconds (to four decimal places), and nothing else.\n\nAnd it's hard. Like, really damn hard. When you start out, you probably won't last much longer than 50 seconds for the first few plays as you learn the behaviors of the monsters, as well as the Do's and Don'ts of maneuvering in such a claustrophobic slice of Hell. It is a testament to this game's design, however, that with repeated play you will get noticeably better. There's more skill than luck involved in good play, and you'll start to wonder how you could ever manage the indignity of a 50-second time again as you start climbing to the 100, 200, 300 second marks and beyond. There is a method to the madness this game throws at you, one spooky wave after another, and it will pummel the method right into you.\n\nAesthetically, this game is on point. The art direction is a deliberate nod to Quake more than anything - I believe the developers said they were going for the feel of a "'90s shooter fever dream." Sounds about right.\nThe deliberately low-res graphics are brown and black and red all over (not a criticism - it fits right in), and the monster designs are as creepy as they are well-rendered.\nThe sounds are of an auditory palette that is altogether eerie, otherworldly, and unsettling.\nEven the menu music is the sort of industrial nightmare that Trent Reznor could've whipped up.\n\nThe action itself is fluid, jank-free and suited to the pace this game expects of you. In further nods to Quake and its brood, there's bunny-hopping and "rocket"-jumping (firing the dagger blast into the ground) to get around, though I've only found limited use for the latter. Top replays I've watched seem to reinforce this, unless I'm not watching closely enough.\n\nIf I have one knock against the game, it's that around the 500 second mark the game shifts into a sort of Thermonuclear Player-Must-Die mode which renders any times past that point more of a matter of luck than skill. Granted, the whole "goal" of the game seems to be to last that long - 500+ second runs are highlighted in red on the leaderboards, and it's the requirement of the game's sole achievement, "Devil Dagger." I suppose that's just me wishing this could go on forever, or that the skill ceiling could be set even higher now that there's 5 players (as of March 1, 2016) who've surpassed the 500 mark, with two of them within just 15 seconds of 600 - I want to see just how far they can reach within this platform without it getting too unfair.\nHowever, for $5, reaching the "goal" will give you a lot of bang for your buck.\n\nIf you like arcadey twitch-action shooters, Devil Daggers is probably the best bargain buy you can get on Steam. Highly recommended.","February 29","true","11.1"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

It feels like Quake with more hellish legions. The sounds and visuals are stunning, the rounds are fast and brutal, and the controls are super tight. There's just enough momentum in your hopping and shotgun-jumping to make tight maneuvers challenging but rewarding to pull off. Each round lasts about 60-90 seconds (for me) and they always get me pumped. I'm not really someone who's typically driven by competition, but the challenge this game presents is too tempting for me to turn down. It's an incredible bullet hell that's devilishly satisfying to play.\n\nOne of my favorite features is how you can download and watch replays from the people topping the leaderboards so you can learn some of the tactics they use to stay alive. And in a game like this where mechanical mastery and knowledge of the challenges you'll have to face are key to survival, that's an amazing feature. Even the top-scoring run is less than eight minutes long at the time of writing this - which means the game is incredibly challenging - but there's a lot of nuance in understanding the enemy design and movement, so having an opportunity to see the game from the perspective of someone who clearly has a level of mastery beyond your own is invaluable.\n\nThe game almost feels minimalist in design. There's one game mode, and the core of the gameplay is super simple to learn. But it's brilliant in execution. It's extremely satisfying. I'm addicted to trying to beat my friends' scores. I cannot recommend this game more highly for the price.","February 21","true","15.0"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","0"

If you're not careful, frustration can set in, and perhaps a sense that you're just not good enough. But this game... this game! It teaches you its mastery without saying a word, all it asks is that you try, try and try again. Before you know it, you start to learn, to pick up patterns, try new strategies. It doesn't always work. In fact, it usually doesn't work. Games can be over in seconds, but hit "R" and you're immediately reset for another fateful attempt. Come back the next day and suddenly realise that your brain has subtly rewired itself and you're just a little bit better at it. Can't get past 60 seconds? Keep at it, before long you'll be disappointed in yourself if you don't get to 60 seconds each time.\n\nThis game is beautiful in the way it rewards you, the first time you kill a skull spider you'll want to punch the air, the first time you level up your weapon you'll feel a sense of euphoria. It's like a drug, and highly addictive, and surprisingly despite the fact each game is over in seconds, or perhaps minutes as you get better, you'll find that half an hour has past before you know it.\n\nDevil Daggers is Robotron by way of Quake, HR Geiger's fever dream with audio by Lustmord. It's Doom on speed. If you have any love for the purity of fast-paced arena action, whether arcade or FPS, you should give this a shot. And when you die, and you will, just try again. And again.

It is also everything that is right with the indie gaming world. Devil Daggers is beautiful, short, cheap, and highly addictive - although not completely without faults, as discussed below. This game will smother you with its elegantly simple yet rich, dark atmosphere. The graphics are perfect; the ambient sounds are terrifying yet very informative to a veteran player.\n\nThis title does perfectly what indie games should do: it takes risks and keeps things simple, boiling everything down to a beautifully addictive mechanism to keep you coming back for more (and my god the price is too cheap).\n\nThe premise of Devil Daggers is really simple. You have to survive as many seconds as possible on a small-ish round platform surrounded in darkness. You have two attacks - a 'stream' of daggers (acts like a whip of sorts), and a shotgun blast of daggers. Your 'success' or 'score' is measured in seconds, and will be measured up against the world of gamers (and your Steam friends). The succession or waves of monsters is static, but how you go about it can differ remarkedly. The game has several nuances that really add depth. You can 'dagger jump' if you figure out how. There apparently is another ledge on the outside for the first 80 seconds. Closer enemies are a different color, and so on.\n\nPros:\n+The dark atmosphere was masterfully crafted and gives quite an experience that keeps luring me back in.\n+The lack of music proper, with just ambient sounds is crazy scary and gives a fantastic experience.\n+The controls are spot-on.\n+It is utterly addicting! I didn't quite get it from watching videos - they all seem so repetitive - you have to try this for yourself!\n+The price-tag is a shame. This deserves more.\n+The global leaderboards are awesome. Oh man I'm coming for that #1 spot among my friends!\n\nCons:\n-This is such a perfect 'base' for a larger game. I'm thinking some crazy shooter in the vein of Doom or Hexen. This would make a great mini-game or mode for that larger game. Who knows, I've seen the developer comment about future content.\n-After the initial excitement and beating your record fairly often, you have to be self-driven to really get better and grind it out. Therefore, mileage will vary by person. Its still worth five bucks in my book, regardless.\n-There are no video options, and I've had issues getting it to work on both  my computers. With that in mind, the developer actually released a patch within 24 hours of my post that helped out (now I'm having trouble on the original computer that worked - but thats a whole other story).\n\nOne of the most addicting and well built games I have played in a while. If you are on the fence - just get it because you can get a heck of alot of playtime in with 2 hours (remember surviving 60 seconds is a chore!), saving you the chance to refund.","March 17","true","4.6"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","11","13","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dinoracha/recommended/422970/","dinoracha","Dinoracha","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dinoracha/","426 products in account","Devil Daggers is an odd game to discuss since it’s very ‘small’, but it can easily be described as a spooky first person shooter time attack game that is dirt cheap, but incredibly challenging. It’s a very deceptive game however, as the simple objective of staying alive for as long as possible is marred by specific rules used by the enemies that in theory are simple to read and avoid, but when put into play together go from zero to frighteningly threatening in no time at all. Add to that a leaderboard that demands player perfection to reach the top, and you have a small game that fills a -big- niche.\n\nThe name of the game is survival, and with every passing second the game grows more and more invested in murdering the crap out of you. At first you’ll simply get squid-like enemies that vomit a gaggle of minor skulls and a lone horned skull that tracks you much more intently when your back is turned, but before long the danger rockets up with enemies like ribbed-horned skulls that are -very- keen on biting your ankles and horrifying spiders that will produce offspring when they consume the valuable gems dropped by enemies, [just] to name a few of the obstacles the game will employ against you. Gems  dropped from specific enemies go towards powering up your dagger firing hand, and make no mistake, you -need- these upgrades if you want to survive beyond a minute. You at first have two methods of attack; a constant stream of daggers machine gun style or a shotgun blast that does great damage. The only issue is that the shotgun spray is random, which is a realistic representation, but having a run be ended by a minor skull because a stray round zips by its target grows incredibly frustrating after multiple attempts at a record run.

Thanks to the study of replays and chatter on forums, subtleties like bunny-hopping and rocket-jumping have been picked up along with other nuances; always keep moving, let off on firing to gather gems quickly, prioritize certain targets, and so on.

Thankfully death can be -very- brief, as a tap of the R key at any time will reset the game into a new, fresh run for you to attempt.\n\nYou won’t be playing this game to relax and unwind thanks to the frightening enemy design and the deliciously disturbing sound design. The way the spiders flail and the crackling of their spindly limbs echoes nearby, pursuing skulls pant like horrid dogs when they’re an inch away from robbing your run. When the later minutes start rolling on not only are the constant waves of enemies overwhelming but the sounds that are going on are oppressive on the eardrums. I actually have to turn down my volume while playing, otherwise I begin to sweat and feel more stress than one should, never mind when I get to later times where my limbs begin to tighten and my heart rate leaps up. I can’t quite put my finger on why, but the Quake-style graphics only add that bit more to the appeal.

The lightning quick restarts, the near seamless replay system, the floaty yet fully controllable movement and shooting, the sound design that will plague my nightmares in the most positive ways possible… As far as time attack games go, Devil Daggers is, for my money, the very best you can get. It’s also stupidly affordable at $5.49 (Canadian), so striving for leaderboard greatness will only hamper your blood pressure, not your wallet.

It’s a very deceptive game however, as the simple objective of staying alive for as long as possible is marred by specific rules used by the enemies that in theory are simple to read and avoid, but when put into play together go from zero to frighteningly threatening in no time at all. Add to that a leaderboard that demands player perfection to reach the top, and you have a small game that fills a -big- niche.\n\nThe name of the game is survival, and with every passing second the game grows more and more invested in murdering the crap out of you. At first you’ll simply get squid-like enemies that vomit a gaggle of minor skulls and a lone horned skull that tracks you much more intently when your back is turned, but before long the danger rockets up with enemies like ribbed-horned skulls that are -very- keen on biting your ankles and horrifying spiders that will produce offspring when they consume the valuable gems dropped by enemies, [just] to name a few of the obstacles the game will employ against you. Gems  dropped from specific enemies go towards powering up your dagger firing hand, and make no mistake, you -need- these upgrades if you want to survive beyond a minute. You at first have two methods of attack; a constant stream of daggers machine gun style or a shotgun blast that does great damage.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/venom517/recommended/422970/","venom517","Venom517","http://steamcommunity.com/id/venom517/","265 products in account","Devil Daggers is fast, snappy, frustrating, maddening, terrible, wonderful, and hellish.\n\nThe game is simple. Stay alive for as long as you possibly can while fighting off Hell's armies in a dim, dark, purgatorial arena, with nothing but your rapid-fire daggers and your (hopefully sharp) reaction times. Harkening back to late 90's games such as Quake, the movement system is extremely satisfying. Of course, you have standard movement with WASD and your mouselook, but once you get the general hang of the game, you can introduce bunny-hopping and dagger jumping into your repetoire. These systems reward you with speed and manueverability that can turn average, 'nothing special' runs into challenges to the world's top players. While not as snappy as one might like, its movement system just feels right at home here, and is immensely satisfying.\n\nTruth be told, I'm not even that big of a fan of wave-based survival games. Sure, I've played and enjoyed games like Geometry Wars, (which, admittedly, is very similar to Devil Daggers IMO, just from an entirely different perspective,) but none of them have held my attention quite like Devil Daggers has. While a hefty portion of this addictive nature comes from the game just being fun as all hell, it's also partly due to the leaderboard system. Quite a few friends of mine picked up the game when it came out, and we slowly started ramping up our challenges to each other. Thirty second survival became seventy, seventy became one-twenty, and so-on and so-forth. I've swore up and down, I've shrieked like a small child upon near misses with skulls, and have had my feet tapping in anticipation beneath my desk, all because my best time was MILLISECONDS off my friend's best, and I was so close. Admittedly, they've all moved onto other games, and I finally hold the crown at 427 seconds. But... given that my record is about 70 seconds shy of the coveted Devil Dagger status, I can't just stop there, can I?\n\nIn addition to being one of the most fun games I've played this past year, it's an amazing looking and sounding game. I'm a complete fanatic for PSX-style graphics. The blocky style, abysmal render distance, primitive lighting systems and poor aliasing admittedly looks awful by today's standards, but it's incredibly charming to anyone who grew up with a Playstation One in their home. Devil Daggers effortlessly merges the look of a late-run PSX game with an aesthetic similar to Quake and a mid-90s Slayer album cover, and it always looks fantastic. At this point, with some research, I could probably write a scientific paper on why I love this visual style so, so much, but I'll keep that toned down for this.\n\nIf there's one aspect of Devil Daggers that absolutely must be talked about, it's the immaculate sound design. A satisfying sound is what makes the difference between a weapon being limp and forgettable, or powerful and an icon of an entire genre (see: the Super Shotgun from Doom II, or the AWP from any of Counter Strike's iterations.) Or, as another example, making the presentation of in-game reward boring and unfulfilling, or something that straight-up makes your day upon finding it. Sound is a big deal to me in just about every medium, but video game sound design, (especially in shooters,) is extremely important. Devil Daggers sets a bar for what audio in video games should be.\n\nEvery crunch, splatter, and skitter has an unsettling bite to it that is distinct and clearly heard amidst the madness of the arena. Each enemy has a 'chatter' for when they are encroaching on your person, and getting dangerously close to ending your run for good. Enemy spawners have an ominous, low hum or a disgusting chitter to signify where they're coming from, or that yes, they are still there. Death rattles and screeches offer a triumphant, yet haunting finality to taking down a larger enemy. The sound of firing daggers grows from a machine-like drone to shrill screams of the damned with each upgrade you gain. And of course, above it all, Devil Daggers incorporates   a positional 3D surround sound system, assisting the player in knowing where their next threat is without much difficulty. Everything is accounted for, it's satisfying, unsettling, and so, so good.\n\nTo make a send-up to 90's FPS games can be done by just about anyone with a Unity engine license. To make that same tribute by building your own engine, creating sound and art that is equally impressive and sinister, and designing one of the most immersive and entertaining arena shooters I've ever seen takes someone like Matt Bush, who did an incredible job with Devil Daggers as a whole.\n\nAt the end of the day, you can get either Devil Daggers or a nice burger for five US dollars. They'll both end up shortening your life-span in some form, and I mean that in the most sincere way possible.","May 20","true","41.1"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","0"

It does everything it says it can on the package, and does it all while looking great, feeling great, and sounding great too.\n\nPositives:\n\n-The visuals, the sound design, the gamefeel, all of these work together very well to create something new and unique while also harkening back to older, more cozier days of PC gaming.\n\n-Satisfying and challenging combat that usually makes you want to give it another go after you die.\n\n-Really cool leader boards system that lets you see your friends and other top players runs with the ability to slow them down and see how exaclty they survived for that long.\n\n-An overall awesome little package for only $5.\n\nCons:\n\n-There might not be enough in the game to interest some players. An endless survival mode has the possibility to be boring for some, even when everything else in it is great.\n\n-The sheer challenge of surviving long enough to see what other types of hellish hordes the game has to throw at you might be simply too challenging for some players to accomplish. So far, there are no easy modes or cheat codes to accomodate them, albeit if there were easy-modes/cheats, it would be best that the leaderboards would be disabled in those modes of course.\n\nOverall:\n\nThis game shows real heart, talent, and effort. It is beautifully Hellish, and capitolizes on this with it's punishing but satisfying gameplay. One can only hope that sometime in the future there will be more to this, or more from these devs, because the engine is amazing in how well it makes retro work on modern day machines. It would be a godsend if it were to one day become open source...

That „s” in particular.  I tend to call it Devil's Dagger whenever I mention it to anyone and then immediately correct myself), because the game is exactly what it says on the tin. And is pretty damn good at it.\n\nTo describe the presentation, let me quote on Shakespeare's: This game is such stuff as dreams are made on”. Not the particularly good dreams though. Pretty nightmarish ones to be honest, and I feel in an hour or two I'll be rather unhappy with myself having decided to play Devil Daggers in headphones, with lights out and home alone. I mean, the game looks like the classic DooM's best moments mixed with the Silent Hill 1- tier disturbing sounds and glued together with the best looking blood I have seen in some time in games (and I've gone to the control panel and shoved some AA and Triple Buffering down the satan's throat - they don't do game much good, but if I'm in hell I could as well play by my own rules).\n\nNot like you will get chance to enjoy the views since Devil Daggers is actually fast and unforgiving. And we're talking here Quake 1 fast. As far as the „unforgiving” part is concerned – one hit and it's over. And no, it's not an uncommon sight to have 30 or so enemies onscreen at a time. Imagine Serious Sam series (sounds awesome) with one hit point. Got the image ?\n\nMy major (and by major I mean the only, but rather significant) problem with the game is the lack of diversity. I mean, the only thing that really changes are the kinds and the numbers of enemies on the screen. Ok, to be fair you can improve your weapons one or two times (and trust me, they look and sound -just like everything in this game – nightmarishly gorgeous) but still, I have felt tired with the game after the first hour. Which isn't good. But there are strafe jumps and rocket jumps which is.\n\nTo be honest, if you enjoy arena shooters and beating your and your friend's high scores you could completely disregard my complaint. From that standpoint, the Devil Dagger's pricetag is more than fair. I am well aware that I enjoy my games mostly for the storyline and character development. At this point you should probably ask why the flying ♥♥♥♥ am I buying and reviewing the game utterly devoid of the elements I like and my answer would probably be that I want to support the developers. I definitely enjoy the game's aesthetics and I hope that the game sells well enough for the authors to introduce some variety in the content patches. And maybe some randomly generated dungeons and some excuse plot the next time we meet? Please?\n\n[wersja polska]\n\nPozwólcie, że zaczniemy od stwierdzenia że zazwyczaj nie piszę recek zanim nie spędzę z daną grą dłuższej chwili. Tym razem jednak odnoszę wrażenie że „Devil Daggersy” (jak mnie irytuje ta nazwa, „s” mi zawsze ucieka, piszę Devil's Dagger a potem się poprawiam) mógłbym recenzować nie uruchamiając w ogóle gry. Głównie dlatego że wystarczy obejrzeć trailer żeby wiedzieć dokładnie co się dostaje kupując grę. Devil Daggers uruchamiamy po to żeby przekonać się że jest, wybaczcie stwierdzenie, diablo dobra w tym co robi.\n\nPozwólcie, że żeby opisać to jak gra się prezentuje powołam się na Shakespeare'owskie „Jest z tego samego materiału co nasze sny”. Tylko nie te dobre sny. Bardziej te paskudne, małe, psychodeliczne koszmarki i mam wrażenie że za jakąś godzinę czy dwie nie będę mógł sobie darować że postanowiłem grać w Devil Daggers ze słuchawkami, przy zgaszonym świetle i sam w domu. Serio, weźcie najlepsze momenty klasycznych DooMów, dodajcie niepokojące dżwięki jakby żywcem wydarte z pierwszego Silent Hilla i sklejcie to wszystko najlepiej wyglądającą krwią jaką widzieliście od dość dawna w grach - macie Devil Daggers (na marginesie, wskoczyłem do kontrolek karty graficznej i wepchnąłem szatanowi w gardło AA i Potrójne buforowanie – absolutnie nie zmieniają wyglądu gry, ale skoro już jestem w piekle, mogę grać na własnych zasadach).\n\nZ resztą Devil Daggers nie daje czasu na podziwianie widoków – jest szybki i wymagający. I mówimy tu o „szybki” na poziomie Quake 1 multi a przez „wymagający” rozumiem „jedno uderzenie i po tobie”. No to dodajmy jeszcze że 30+ przeciwników na ekranie to całkiem częsty widok po pierwszej minucie gry. Serious Sam z jednym hit pointem dobrze oddaje to co chcę tu przekazać.\n\nMoim głównym (i przez głównym rozumiem: jedynym ale znaczącym) problemem z tą grą jest brak różnorodności. Z tego co wiem dostajemy jedną planszę w nieskończoność, zmienia się tylko liczba i rodzaj przeciwników, ulepszamy broń raz czy dwa, ale to tyle. Szczerze mówiąc DD zmęczyło mnie po mniej niż godzinie a nie jest to dobra wiadomość.

There isn't much I should say about it. If it looks appealing to you at all, do yourself a favour, purchase it and try to dive in as blind as possible.\n\nEverything this game does is pulled off almost perfectly. To some, it may not seem like there is much to this game, but there are so many subtle details that make this work excellently. This game has great sound design and doesn't have a soundtrack. That may seem strange, but in my opinion it is a fantastic idea for this game. It's all about listening for where all the enemies are and panicing about trying to kill them all. You should find yourself being completely immersed into your short runs, struggling to stay alive.\n\nI found it interesting how much fun I was having in getting higher and higher on the leaderboard. Before I played this, I was sceptical of the game focusing on a leaderboard system. I thought that I would only spend a few hours playing and then get bored, but this game is so much fun and so addicting. I also adore the art style.\n\nThis game has received a lot of well deserved attention in a very short period of time and I'm glad that is the case.

It's unbelievably hard, but that's the point. There's always room for improvement. You don't just play once and win. It's challenging and fun.\n-The atmosphere is really good. The sounds, optics and movements are all very well harmonized with each other.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this game for people who:\n- Don't liked fast paced games.

Don't be surprised if you're stuck below the 40 second mark for a while.\n- Nothing is explained in-game. While this adds some mystery and discovery elements, it also adds artifical difficulty. (Read the Gameplay Features section on its Steam page to get an idea of some of the core abilities available to you).\n- There is enough RNG in the game to keep it from getting stale, but not so much that it distorts the rankings on the leaderboards. As a result, people's records feel fair.\n- You can view in-game replays of other player's records. This will spoil whole sections of the game, but does demonstrate that these 600 second runs are in fact completely achievable.\n\nThe art and sound design is unique enough to give the game its own charms.

I will start off saying that it is not by any means the greatest one out there of it's style and genre, but is a contender for that spot. The mechanics are fluid and simple, you run and shoot in a very natural way, which is something the game needs and does well. The main focus here is to survive as long as possible while fighting hordes of demonic creatures in a small arena. This objective might not be well suited for people who are coming here expecting a story driven game or a multiplayer experience, it is in its entirety a leaderboard game. You basicly play to prove that you are better than other people and that's fine as long as you enjoy this type of game.\nAs for difficulty, the game starts off hard and only gets harder, there's no difficulty settings, so you are stuck in a hellish situation (pretty fitting for the game actually). The enemies are simple, but they don't need to be any more than what they already are, meaning that the game does a pretty good job in keeping you on your toes with the simplest types of creatures. They will either spawn enemies, roam around the arena, or hunt you down, creating a very interesting situation that makes you constantly move away and kill to survive.\nIf anything, this game is worth the money in my opinion, it has enjoyable gameplay mixed with nice atmospheric sounds that never fail to make you feel like you are in hell and your only weapon is your dagger-shooting hand.","March 2","true","11.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/avp66/recommended/422970/","avp66","Krev","http://steamcommunity.com/id/avp66/","169 products in account","tl;dr Survival-Horror FPS Bullet Hell that'll probably push you until you're drenched in your own sweat, if you're willing. Not much of a direct story, it's got Quake-esque visuals, and is pretty much all about surviving as long as you can.\n\nThe first thing you hear?\nA bone-like grinding and groaning, building slowly into a beat that your heart will soon be thumping to.\nThe first thing you see?\nA fountain of skulls drifitng skyward, in all their morbid Quake-esque glory.\n\nAnd that's just the menu; a prelude to the fast-paced action where few survive beyond a single minute, and where even the most cool-tempered find themselves wiping the sweat from their brow as they run through an addictive game of trial, error, and survival - one that I recommend to anyone with a few dollars and a thirst for the challenging.\n\n\nAt it's core, Devil Daggers is something of a first-person bullet hell. Stylized rather heavily, following the old aesthetic of 1990s games such as Quake or Unreal, the game looks splendid for what it is. There isn't much direct story, but it's got hordes of chilling abominations in the dark, waiting to tear you apart, and the gameplay is solid.\n\nYou (the player) are a fragile thing, perishing in a single hit from the eldritch beasts that lurk in the dark, endless in number and relentlessly hunting you down on the little circular arena that is all you know. They do not stop, pause, or hesitate, and the chilling, screeching affairs of bone, tentacle, and lord-knows-what-else will certainly show no mercy, from the lowly Swarmer-Skull, to the hellish mega-beasts that lay beyond.\n\nYou have but three defenses; your wits, your speed, and your daggers, and you must use all of them to the best of your abilities to even have a chance beyond that first minute.\n\nMovement is fast, and solid options and strategies exist utilizing it to the fullest. You can sprint around the arena with ease, make sudden jumps and dodges, and even boost them with a well-timed daggershot blast, propelling you up and over the enemy... Or into them, as it may happen.\n\nWhile you can run, quick thinking and adaptation is key, lest you find yourself getting blindsided, slamming into a monolithic beast, or worse yet, sailing off of the arena and into the abyss below, killed by your own ignorance. Even then, if you're quick on your keys, catching yourself and dashing out of danger, that's still not enough; you can't outrun them forever. Even if you can play your foes into running in circles around you, eventually it'll become too much to handle; after all, you're only thinking and running.\n\nThus is where the daggers come in. Your only real offensive armament, they're rather effective at stemming the tide, able to be fired in a constant stream without end, or in a shotgun-like blast known (at least to me) as the daggershot. They aren't exactly the fastest things in the universe, but they're what you have, and you don't run out of them. Though their effectiveness is somewhat limited in the beginning against meatier foes, as you bring the fight to them with your daggers, you can claim demonic gems, and eventually gain much-needed upgrades to them.\n\nNot that they're much use to you if you don't know how to use them right, though, and not to mention they aren't going to do you any good if you don't get moving, no matter how reliable they are.\n\nEven then, if you're keeping on your toes, leaving an eye on things, and waiting for the right moment to throw out a dagger or twelve, it's no guarantee you'll make it past even thirty seconds. You're going to die some time. The enemy is just as fast, if not faster than you, and they don't stop coming. They never will.\n\nThat's just a truth of Devil Daggers. That said, how long do you think you'll last?\nThere's a leaderboard, if you want to try your luck.","March 12","true","7.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

While this review is negative, it only means that I do not personally recommend the game. It does not mean that I think that this is a terrible game, so please do not vote me down just because you are a fanboy defending your game.\n\nThat being said, Devil Daggers consists of surviving as long as possible in a (very small) square where darkness reigns, while killing hundreds of skulls thrown at you. That's all there is to the game, no levels to beat, no permanent or temporary progression, just occasionally a new enemy type makes its appearance while the skulls keep swarming and swarming.\n\nTentacle pillars dispense skulls and need to be disposed of quickly after their first batch before they vomit an overwhelming army. Flying skulls are quick, they home in on the players, and are a CONSTANT pain to deal with. Very rarely there is a moment to breathe, which means that the pacing of the game is very intense, and in my opinion completely off. It feels tedious and repetitive. Moreover, always the same enemies are coming at the same moment, so unlike roguelites the player does not learn the systems and then adapt to different situations: here, the sequence is the same, so the player has to do the same thing over and over until they learn the partition of the music they play (although there is no in-game soundtrack).\n\nI would compare this game to Super Hexagon: play the sequence over and over until you get good at mastering it, and then get farther into the game.\n\nConversely, I suppose that some very skilled players would be able to get quite far without needing to learn the sequence, just by sheer skill of shooting and moving, The shooting consists of pressing once for shotgun or keeping the finger of the mouse for machine gun fire. Collecting gems from enemies (stop shooting to attract them like a magnet) eventually upgrades the firepower. Shooting feels good, just too bad that I am fighting swarms of skulls and not interesting enemy types that come in waves inside a bigger arena.\n\nA very interesting addition to this game is the ability to watch the replay from anyone in the leaderboard. Very useful to learn or just be mesmerized at the graphics without focusing on surviving.\n\nTo me the main draw of the game is the art style and atmosphere (although there is no in-game soundtrack). The graphics and gameplay throw back to Quake, and will probably draw the same kind of elitist crowd.

Pick it up when you have 3 minutes to kill. Well maybe a bit more since it seems to take quite a while to load up. But once done, you get thrown right in the action. Move around with WASD, look around with mouse, hold LMB to fire a continuous stream of "daggers" and tap LMB to shotgun more "daggers".\n\nEasy to understand your only objective is to survive as long as possible with the constant demon barrage and that's it! You get a leaderboard that shows the best players in the world as well as your friends to brag around.\n\nMy only complain is the minimalist options available. You can only decide mouse sensitivity, volume level and if you are left handed or not. I wish there would be an option for resolution as to me it appeared as a good old 800x600 scaled up to my monitor. At least it ran a constant 120 FPS no matter how many hundreds of demons were sprawling around my screen.","February 18","true","5.8"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","13","22","3","0"

Sound design is incredible and the game is an all round technical marvel. The lightning pace and insta-restart keep pushing you to unfold the behaviours of the few but fantastically designed enemies, and perfect the manic dance required to crawl your way up the leaderboard.\n\nWould probably drop £10 on this if I knew in advance the experience I'd be getting. for £4 you can't go wrong","March 3","true","7.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's realizing there is nowhere else for you to go, and giving up.\n\nDevil Daggers is a fight between you and some floating skulls in Hell. It looks like 1996-era Quake and it's meant to because that's how it wants to intimidate you. The soundscape of Devil Daggers involves skull noises, raspy laughter, high-pitched screaming, industrial humming, and spider tickling. Your job is to survive the hordes of skulls and to take their precious blood rubies - initially, they don't do anything, but if you grab ten of those things, you become a more powerful monster among the monsters, nuking skulls and creepy spider-skull monsters with greater ease. But just because you're a more powerful combatant doesn't mean it will get easier, because Devil Daggers will throw all sorts of ♥♥♥♥ at you, and it loves to make you squirm.\n\nYour first few playthroughs will last approximately around 60 seconds. In order to 'beat' the game (read: get the sole achievement that says 'Devil Daggers'), you will need to last 500 seconds, or approximately 8 minutes and 20 seconds. This is not a goal you are likely to accomplish unless you are very, very good at first person shooters. I consider myself well-learned in the genre and I made it half a second away from three minutes (which puts me roughly in the top 10% of all players who have submitted a score). At the time of this review, only seven people have beaten this game out of the 27,000 players that have tried to conquer it so far. That does not make it a bad game, that makes us all weak people who can't stand up in the face of naked, unfiltered terror, and those seven people are our champions.\n\nDevil Daggers is a game you're not likely to beat, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't count it out. After all, the narrative experience is not the only valid experience in video games. Sometimes crying in the face of seemingly insurmountable frustration is a valid experience, too.","March 5","true","6.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The gameplay and the movement feels very responsive and extremely fast-paced. Enemies never stop rushing at you and you have to constantly keep looking over your shoulder and running around if you want to last. The art-style is so awesome, it's like DOOM pixelart but in a Quake polygon kinda way. Also, the sound design is very well done. Every creature makes its own noise that's instantly distinguishable and you can easily tell from which direction they're coming from; just based on the sounds you hear.\n\nIf you enjoy very fast-paced old-school arena FPSs with the concept of surviving as long as possible, this is just the game for you.\n\nIf you care more about "content" than actual gameplay, then this isn't for you.\n\nJust a suggestion for the developer if you read this (thumbs up so he can see cx) I would really LOVE if you added a daily challenges mode, sorta like in binding of Isaac. You could change one little thing about the gameplay everyday for that specific mode, like for example: a smaller arena, faster enemies, more powerfull daggers, etc. Just to have an interesting daily variation from the core game.","February 25","true","79.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

The challenge goes beyond any game I have ever played and I've been playing fps for twevle years.  The controls are immediately recognizeable by any seasoned FPS veteran yet it will take practice to even last longer than one minute! Devil Daggers is the equalizer to all fps player's skills alike.  Can you keep track of the position of enemies while struggling to keep them under control? Can you bunny hop just to outrun the ones that you do not have time to worry about? Can you utilize a "dagger jump" to evade death where you are certainly surrounded?

You'll restart hundreds of times just to be put back in the same exact place you were when you started.\nSounds are a bit unsettling. Might want to play some music or talk to friends while playing\nNot many settings. It's hard to record/livestream on fullscreen games\nThe game development time to price ratio is a little off.

I know the achievement is supposed to be the one and only rare achievement, but I still wish there were achievements for every minute you can last (World Record is 10 minutes)\nConclusion:\nIf you ever played and liked the DOOM games, buy this game.\nIf you have a taste for this visual style, buy this game.\nIf you want something for you and your friends to play and compare high scores, buy this game.\nIf you like games that hold your hand like the baby you are, buy this game and take your beating.","April 8","true","1.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

Devil Daggers was clearly intended as a Geometry Wars-style fast-playing game from its inception. The enemy design and the player's offensive capacity have been meticulously balanced in a way that a typical first person shooter is not.\n\nNot only does Devil Daggers feature a color palette, resolution, lighting style, and texture design similar to Quake 1, this game features twitch-shooter gameplay that is roughly equivalent to the speed of action of the classic Quake series. There are some additional visual effects, some nice particle splashes and very accurate lighting beyond what you'd see in a classic shooter, but the designers of the game were clearly going for a retro graphics style. The sound design is also excellent as well, the enemies emit chilling sounds which also inform the player of critical enemy direction and proximity.\n\nPlayers will likely find their first deaths come in around one minute time, but after working at the game for a few hours further plateaus of game score will be reached.\n\nFinally, the price of $5 is so right for what this game delivers. That isn't to say the game isn't worth more than $5, but at $5 this game SHOULD be an impulse purchase for EVERY fast paced action gamer with a fondness for challenge.","February 21","true","8.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Remember that ♥♥♥♥♥in’ guitar riff? What about Quake? Hexen? Remember the old 90’s FPS games where you ran around at ninety miles per hour shooting demon’s in the face with a shotgun and a machine gun? Remember rocket jumping in a deathmatch arena?\n\nMe either, I was like one when DOOM came out; and about four when Quake came out. So I kinda missed the crazy FPS’s of the 90’s… But I did enjoy my fair share of the Duke!\n\nAnyway, what if I told you there was a game that channeled what you remembered of those amazing games from the 90’s. Tight controls, high speed non stop action, LOTS of blood, Rocket Jumping, and hundreds of slathering demons ready to be murdered? And on top of all that it doesn’t have the horrid level design!\n\nWell, then I’m proud to tell you that Devil Daggers is available on steam… And it is everything we look back on the 90’s and remember fondly about First-Person Shooters without any of the blemishes of the time.\n\nIt has an amazing software rendered look, while also having modern polygonal models and exquisite lighting effects. And it has the advantage of modern hardware to render hundreds of simultaneous enemies. More than your brain can parse at once. Devil Daggers is a wonderful mixture of new and old. It’s nostalgia made real. Even if you weren’t around long enough to HAVE nostalgia for DOOM.\n\nI’ve shown Devil Daggers to about everyone I know who will watch. I like it so much. Why? Because it isn’t trying to be something it isn’t. It’s simple, and it does what it does so incredibly well.\n\nIf I had to categorize Devil Daggers, I would call it a ‘timed wave based FPS survival game’. But, if I’m being real, I would say it’s verdammt schlecht ♥♥♥. Everything in Devil Daggers is fast, and doesn’t care if you can’t tell what’s going on. It’s hard, it knows it, and it wants you dead. You have to be able to keep up.\n\nYou, the player, are placed in a dark abyssal arena, your only weapon is your hand. Index and middle finger extended; which shoots flaming daggers. And then, surreptitiously an infernal tentacled birthing pod calmly, ominously, floats out of the darkness towards you. It stirs and a flock of demonic skulls erupt from it and try to engulf you. And that’s the basic premise. Kill the skulls or be killed.\n\nOne touch and you’re dead. Also did I mention there are hundreds of them?\n\nEverything in the game is based off of time. The longer you survive the crazier things get. But eventually you’re able to parse the times at which everything starts to happen and you can get a feel for when something is going to be making an appearance.\n\nThe fourth Birthing Pod just died, that means I have about threes seconds before the massive spider skull spawns.\n\nThis game doesn’t hold your hand either. It expects you to figure everything out on your own. But it definitely gives you a large amount of feedback for your actions. It doesn’t tell you that you can, and should, bunny hop; or that if you time it right you can nearly double your speed. Nor does it tell you that you need to be collecting the gems that come out of the different types of enemies. Get enough and you’ll become more powerful… If you can survive long enough.\n\nDevil Daggers expects you to pay attention. And I appreciate that. It doesn’t hold back… and being able to overcome its challenges is incredibly exhilarating and rewarding. When I started playing on February 20th I could only last about 40 seconds. Now my highest score is 206.9 seconds.\n\nAs of this writing I am currently ranked 156th out of 9345 players. I am the 1.66%\n\nAs you get better it’s a great feeling. I haven’t been as absorbed by a leaderboard game… Ever. Something about the break neck speed, super intense combat, and absolutely amazing sound design really come together to make an experience that is just amazing. …It’s so memorable.\n\nI was at the movies today, and I could hear the sound the enemies make as if they were floating around me.\n\nWhen I get into a good rhythm, and I’m timing my bunny hops just right I can feel my leg tensing to keep pace as if I was playing the drums.\n\nSurviving just a few seconds longer than your old score immediately produces copious amounts of adrenaline in your body. My previous high score was 194 seconds, getting to 197 seconds made my hands shake.\n\nLearning this game, and bettering my play style has been an incredible experience.\n\nWhat’s even cooler is that each time you rank on the leaderboards, the game uploads a replay of your session for everyone to watch. Meaning all of the top player’s secrets are mine to learn!\n\nWatching them play the game is a totally different experience from when I play. The amount of time they spend standing still, or not shooting is very impressive and inspiring. Currently the game’s developer has a high score of ~463 seconds. And I tried emulating his style of ‘farming’ the Birthing Pods. And wasn’t able to keep up with the massive swarm of skulls following me… But maybe one day….\n\nDevil Daggers is a fantastic game that you should definitely check out. It does one thing, and does it so, so, so well. This game is polished, refined, and tuned to perfection.\n\nPlus it’s only $4.99.\n\nIf you’re remotely interested in it, check it out. The art is amazing, the 3D sound is out of this world, the action is headache inducing, and rush is addicting to say the least…\n\nPretty soon you’ll find me on the first page of the leaderboards. Check it.\n\nIf you liked this review, check out 100HourSave.com for more.","March 1","true","17.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is one of the best games ever. If you have a little time to spare, but don't want to start playing a big game like Fallout 4 or Witcher 3, this game is great, because it is so difficult that the best player hasn't even lasted 10 minutes. It is also great because if you have a lot of time, you can sit down and try to climb the leaderboard, for every second added to your score could bump you up hundreds of places on the leaderboard.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/imapeopletoo/recommended/422970/","imapeopletoo","im a people too","http://steamcommunity.com/id/imapeopletoo/","70 products in account","Devil Daggers is a panic shooter which requires situation awareness, precision aim, and mob management. Twitch reflexes help but are not essential to playing well. You play on a square grid and encounter mobs comprised of increasingly resilient and speedy enemies. Early game, all mobs spawn from swarm towers that can be destroyed. Later in the game, mobs enter from outside of the area of combat and have vulnerable spots that must be hit in order to earn kills. As you kill stronger mobs, you can harvest red gems that increase the area of effect and power of your fire, and (at certain breakpoints) massively upgrade your damage output.\n\nThe controls are very minimalistic: you can assign four keys to directional movement, one key to jump, one key to your primary fire (hold for stream shot, tap for shotgun), and one key to homing fire (available later in the game). You can perform several special maneuvers including a knife jump (shotgun the ground and jump simultaneously), bunny hop (tap jump again as soon as you land, catapaulting forward), and double jump (still don't know how to do this, or why you ever would).\n\nThe game's graphics are intentionally minimal, designed to ensure that all but the oldest computer setups can run the game at 60fps. This is essential, because any framerate lag would lead to a substantially less enjoyable game. There are only four colors to speak of: black for the environment, orange for the player and player fire, red for gems, and brown for enemy structures.\n\nThe game's sound is incredible. Listening is essential to mastering the waves and thinking ahead. The sound of your fire is rather muted, which is wonderful, because you'll be firing a lot. Different enemies have different audio cues. From the frenetic snapping of swarm skulls, to the clicking of simple patrols, to the manic laughter of pursuers, to the clacking of spiders, to the ominous rumbling of centipedes, each sound is distinct and can layer over the others.\n\nThe only score that matters is seconds: how long did you survive until you were overwhelmed? That is the value that ranks players, and the designers of the game have made it possible for you to review any player's run from the leaderboard. It adds to the experience to be able to watch a top 10 player cruise through content that still overwhelms me.\n\nI have a score in the top 5% of all players, and I am damn proud of it. The game has incredible replay value so far. Each additional second of survival feels like a triumph, and I find the difficulty curve to be immensely rewarding. Mob mechanics that demanded my total attention earlier feel manageable now, while new mobs and new scenarios increasingly challenge my skills and force me to improve or quit.\n\nI haven't quit yet, and don't plan too soon. As of the time that I write this review, my best run ended at 199 seconds and some change. I will feel really satisfied to break 200, and hope to continue scratching my way up the leaderboard.\n\nI believe you will get more than five dollars worth of value from this game. I look forward to seeing future content from the developers. I would love to see addon packs that could change the textures in-game, and would happily pay for the privilege to change the color schemes and enemy models.\n\nUPDATE: Immediately after finishing this review, I smashed my old record and hit 250 seconds. I'm a four minute player now!","February 29","true","73.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Kill awful monsters, steal their crystals to boost your meager power, and NEVER STOP RUNNING.\n\nIt's a great game if you don't have a ton of time, but plenty of patience. Best part is, you can watch the top runs by the top players, learn from their methods, and get a glimpse of the insane fever-dream waiting for you beyond the ten-minute mark (which, as of this writing, only a few people have reached).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AODQ/recommended/422970/","AODQ","AODQ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AODQ/","85 products in account","The main criticism of this game is that the game is lackluster in content for a $5 pricetag. Though there are only a handful of enemies, only two weapon upgrades, and three attacks, they really play together nicely and offer quite a few tactics and strategies to the player. A game like chess has only six unique pieces yet there is a stupidly large complexity and strategy to just the first three moves that can result in either severe punishments or openings farther into the game. Of course, the complexity in this game is at a much lower bar, but my point is that while it seems that there is not much content, the content given offers a ton of replayeability. For example, if you end up wasting a few seconds early on by missing your shots, you could easily just have ♥♥♥♥ed yourself 100 seconds later into the game. Or if you leave a few spawners alive, while the next 30 seconds might be difficult, having an earlier weapon upgrade can help you out afterwards. There's a large tree structure of possible events based on what you do which gives you quite a large amount of replayeability that will entertain for you for many hours.\n\nSometimes, experiencing (often unknowingly & subconsciously) the various tactics/strategies/whatever and improving your own muscle memory to achieve a higher score is much more rewarding than just discovering some arbitrary new enemy or power or whatever. The real content of the game is within the mechanics of the game and the fine tune & complexity of the level itself.\n\nAnother critique levied against Devil Daggers is that there is not enough randomness in the game; the time and position of the enemy spawns are, for the most part, hardcoded. I don't find this a problem as it allows you to develop a strategy and technique rather relying on instict alone. Had there been random spawns, the scores themselves would become reliant on RNG, which is definitely not a good thing for an arcade game.\n\nAnyways, if you enjoy this sort of game, you will easily sink well worth your money into the game and still have fun playing it. From the outside it might not seem $5, but try to get to some score such as 250 seconds and you'll see what I'm talking about (hopefully).","May 16","true","35.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dibbus/recommended/422970/","dibbus","Biscuit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dibbus/","93 products in account","First off, this game is hard as ♥♥♥♥. If the concept of obtaining progression only after putting lots of time into dying repeatedly doesn't appeal to you, then simply don't buy it.\n\nFor everybody else, this game is an absolute masterpiece in high-intensity cluster♥♥♥♥ery. It's made to make you feel helpless, and the only thing that keeps you going is the excrutiating desire to prove those floating skulls wrong.\n\nGraphics are intentionally dated, and you can see the quality underneath all of the pixelation. It's meant to feel like you're playing an arcade cabinet, and it does so very successfully. As a result, I'm inclined to give the look of the game a 10/10, as the art style appeals to me, and it fits the mood of the game. If all of the game's mechanics were placed into unreal engine on ultra settings, it simply wouldn't be the same game, and for that reason I appreciate the decision of the devs to use the charm of pixelated graphics.\n\nSound design is incredible. I have no words to describe the emotions the cacophony of sounds invokes in me. My first few attempts were filled with confusion, and the sound design is almost entirely to blame for that, which is a good thing. When the way a game sounds affects how well you can play, you know you're in for a treat. 10/10.\n\nGameplay is smooth, if only a little undefined. The perspective that's afforded to players makes you feel like you have presence on the stage, which is very much needed once the clock ticks past the 90 second mark for the first time. Knowing where you are on the stage comes very naturally, so I give it an A+ in that regard. Of course, the gameplay isn't without its issues, but the issues I take with it are very subjective and personal to me. I suggest playing the game to get a clear view on how it feels under your mouse and keyboard. 8.5/10\n\nConclusion: The game probably won't ♥♥♥♥ you off until you've died for the 50th time, and even then you will realize it was completely your fault, and not the games. Only until you reach world record status, which an extremely select few have, will you see a very clear line drawn in terms of fairness.\n\nThis game isn't just for people who enjoy the FPS genre, as it's a lot more than that. The omission of a targetting reticle makes the experience a lot more smooth, and the learning curve is steep. Because of this, I'd honestly recommend Devil Daggers the type of gamer that enjoys something like Dark Souls, where punishment is constant but player-perserverance is rewarded greatly.\n\nWith the three aspects of the game I scored, my average comes out to a 9.5, but keep in mind that this game isn't for everyone. Even though I've got a short amount of time played, I'm in the top five thousand globally with a current survival time of 179 seconds. Not everyone is going to catch on in less than two hours. And even though I've achieved this time, I'm still compelled to get even better, eventually obtaining that 0.1% achievement to showcase on my profile until the end of time. Because believe me, that achievement is going to STAY at 0.1% with how hard it is to get.\n","March 29","true","15.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

But it is brutal in a great way.  It punishes you, but not in a cheap way.  When you die, you die through your own faults.  Not paying attention, not listening to the audio cues that tell you death is eminent, not strategizing on which enemy/spawner you need to take out first, and failing to take out said spawner in enough time before the other several spawners on the floor start spawning more monsters.  There is no delay in controling your invisible protagonist.  It will take one to two attempts of playing the game to get a feel for how the daggers (your only weapons) perform.  Every I played, I managed to get just a little further in.  As I have progressed, its difficulty has scalled up and up and up.  Glorious, and engaging.\n\nGameplaywise, this game is solid.  Easy to understand controls, easy to understand mechanics, and really easy to jump in and jump out regarding game play.  One session or an hours worth, you can put as much time as you like in this game and continue enjoying yourself as long as this sort of action FPS horde mode game is your cup of tea.\n\nThe enemies keep coming, and they keep you on your toes constantly, with virtually no breaks to catch your breath.  Which brings me to really the only thing holding this game back from general players.\n\nThere is a limited variety provided by this game.\n\nYou have one weapon, while it does evolve as you progress (hoovering blood crystals or what ever they are), it is still the devil daggers by which the game's title implies.  As you progress through the waves, the enemies increase in number, but seem to be limited to around 10 total types of enemies (this is as much as I have seen through my playthrough and others playthroughs.)\n\nThere is also only ONE dimmly lit arena (that you can kill yourself by falling off the edge), that can leave you wishing it was just a little bigger.  If the game ends, I have not seen the ending yet (at the time of this review).  This unfortunately sets the game with a very small amount of content provided for its cost.\n\nI understand how this sort of thing can be a turn off to people.  As far as I am concerned, this game is simply addictive and amazing in the vein of a solid arcade title.  If the developers decided to add more to the game, it would be amazing, but I personally feel it is not nessesary to maintain a level of interest that will keep me coming back.\n\nGiven its price tag, I would advertise this game as an arcade gem, and well worth the investment.","February 22","true","3.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Resoula/recommended/422970/","Resoula","Resoula","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Resoula/","263 products in account","Devil Daggers is a blast from the past. For those who don’t know what Devil Daggers is, it is a first person shooter reminiscent of 1990s shooters in terms of gameplay and graphics. It is arcadey, fast-paced, and unbelievably difficult. It has no storyline, but instead a series of challenges that spawn as you progress. Is this new five dollar indie game worth your time? Let’s find out!\n\nThe gameplay of Devil Daggers is simple, yet effective. The ability to shoot daggers from your fingertips in spreads and in automatic mode allow for tactical decisions when staring down a horde of demonic skulls chasing after you. Your spread shot can literally launch you off the ground should you choose to aim at the floor and take flight. After you collect enough gems, you can power up and go from shooting a few daggers to unleashing torrents of daggers that will drown smaller enemies in a wave of death. You can even fall off the map which is small enough to present space management as your biggest challenge. This game keeps you on your toes, always succeeding one tough challenge with an even tougher one. It is a very intense game but also one that keeps pushing you to beat your high score again by at least one second. It all plays exactly like you’d want this kind of shooter to play.\n\nGraphically, this game is not what you’d expect from 2016. The graphics are a throwback to the 1990s and they do the job well. If you’re a graphics nut then avoid this at all cost, but if you appreciate spooky art styles and retro graphics then this game is just right for you. The sound effects complement the aesthetic very much. As you power up, the intensity will increase as the sound of what reminds me of a demon screaming blares in your ears. As you shoot more daggers the sound of them leaving your fingers grows louder. If it is possible to match an art style with a style of sound, this game pulled it off. The atmosphere is gripping and the immersion is deep for a game that most players lose within the first 60 seconds.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no story mode or multiplayer functions present in Devil Daggers other than the presence of a global leader board. A story mode could do a game with these mechanics good, in addition to what is essentially the challenge mode that the game is. It is what it is and doesn’t try to be anything more or less.\n\nThere is not much to say about Devil Daggers due to its simplicity. Simplicity however, is both its greatest strength and weakness. The entirety of the game’s content proves to be challenging and extremely fun to play. Unfortunately, the lack of content holds the game back from achieving its true potential. It is not revolutionary, but that’s just fine for a game built on the nostalgia from when it was. Devil Daggers is downright fun and I recommend it to everyone with a tolerance for repetition, fans of shooters or not. This game might just surprise you.\n\n8/10","May 9","true","2.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I think there's no more then 15 enemy types at most, and it follows a set spawn pattern.  BUT, where it excells is how it utilises EVERYTHING effectively. Its an extreamly difficult game, where you'll feel accomplished for surviving even a second or two longer then your best.

The graphical style evokes classic 90's era shooters, and it works extremely well here. Gameplay is stripped down to the absolute bare minimum, there's only one goal; seemingly to stay alive for as long as possible. I think I would've enjoyed the game so much more if there was more to it, some levels to traverse instead of just a straight up endless wave survival mode, but for a game that's whole focus is being so ultra stripped down, it's hard to really fault the pure simplicity of it.

I guess he wants it back because every demon and their cat wants to ♥♥♥♥ me up now that the hand absorbed it.\n\n\nThis game sparked my interest just from aesthetics alone back when I saw it as a greenlight project. Knowing greenlights reputation most would be wary of this games fate. Thankfully it turned out to be a gem. The kind of gem that was put under the same kind of pressure it will now put you under when you play it.\n\nThis game makes me sweat balls. Ten minutes of playing it and I am sweating balls. This game puts you under more stress than the gemstones you carve out of your enemies bodies. The opposition starts out pretty light but no less than ten seconds later you are up against an avalanche of the spooky skeleton swarms from every direction, your only means of detecting the spook parade being their incessant chattering over your shoulder.\n\nWhich means wear headphones. This game is intentionally dark and the only means of knowing where the next swarm is coming from is audio qeues and the faint gleam of gemstones. The fantastic audio design makes me sweat even more balls as skeletors testicles are chattering mere inches behind me.\n\nThe gameplay is basic, and thats good. Its the Hotline Miami of shooters. You spray daggers faster than the beads of sweat will roll down your face or you double click to shotgun blast them. You get touched, you die, you restart, you sweat balls again repeatedly in short bursts of life trying desperately to survive more than mere minutes. Its amazing.\n\nIf you like sweating balls and getting stressed out of your mind you should play this game.","February 20","true","1.8"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","4","8","3","0"

I guess he wants it back because every demon and their cat wants to ♥♥♥♥ me up now that the hand absorbed it.\n\n\nThis game sparked my interest just from aesthetics alone back when I saw it as a greenlight project. Knowing greenlights reputation most would be wary of this games fate. Thankfully it turned out to be a gem. The kind of gem that was put under the same kind of pressure it will now put you under when you play it.\n\nThis game makes me sweat balls. Ten minutes of playing it and I am sweating balls. This game puts you under more stress than the gemstones you carve out of your enemies bodies. The opposition starts out pretty light but no less than ten seconds later you are up against an avalanche of the spooky skeleton swarms from every direction, your only means of detecting the spook parade being their incessant chattering over your shoulder.\n\nWhich means wear headphones. This game is intentionally dark and the only means of knowing where the next swarm is coming from is audio qeues and the faint gleam of gemstones. The fantastic audio design makes me sweat even more balls as skeletors testicles are chattering mere inches behind me.\n\nThe gameplay is basic, and thats good. Its the Hotline Miami of shooters. You spray daggers faster than the beads of sweat will roll down your face or you double click to shotgun blast them. You get touched, you die, you restart, you sweat balls again repeatedly in short bursts of life trying desperately to survive more than mere minutes. Its amazing.\n\nIf you like sweating balls and getting stressed out of your mind you should play this game.","February 20","true","1.8"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","4","8","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SiriusZhar/recommended/422970/","SiriusZhar","m.c.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SiriusZhar/","280 products in account","Devil Daggers, to put it bluntly, is a masterwork. An elegantly designed arcade style arena FPS that not only is an example of a simple idea done well, but its posterchild. From the introductory screen onward, the bleak Gothic atmosphere takes hold, clearly worshiping at the altar of Quake, with stark colors and industrial edged background music. Starting the game, the goal is simple: navigate and combat a horde of demons as they spawn into the arena. The longer you survive, the higher your score, and the higher your place on the leaderboards. One hit however, and it's all over. The game is punishingly difficult, but not unfair. It provides you with a plethora of tools to deal with the onslaught. You have incredible fluidity of movement, that allows you to bunnyhop and dodge and weave your way through enemies. You have a single weapon, the daggers, which are actual projectiles (as opposed to hitscan) with two alternate fire modes, a spraying rapid fire which must be well timed and lead, and a shotgun like blast, that requires twitch accuracy for maximum effect. You can use that blast to catapult yourself into the air, a "rocket jump"-esque maneuver. These abilities not only skyrocket the skill ceiling, but the excellent pace of the game allows you to learn without becoming comfortable, pushing your ability constantly. Once in motion, this is where the visual and sound design shine brightest, both from a mechanical and artistic standpoint. Artistically, the game is one of the most cohesive and focused visions I've seen in games recently. The monster design is impeccable, managing to be both complicated and clear, grotesque and horrifying, and how everything is rendered evokes the days of the old school shooter. On top of that, the 3D sound allows for complete immersion, with each monster giving off it's own call until the arena is crescnedoed into an orchestra of foul clicks, jittering, and crys. Mechanically, these same things give the player all the information they need to move about the arena: monster silhouettes are easily distinguishable, and the host of audio cues not only tell you where the monsters are, but what kind of monster it is lurking outside your vision. But even with all that, the game will kill you. Thankfully it never steps into frustrating territory. The game allows to you instantly restart a run at any time, placing you back at the beginning in less than a second. This ease of access prevents frustration to set in between attempts, and greatly increases the draw of an already addictive formula. And to top it all off with a nice little bow, the leaderboards feature a replay system. Not only will you be able to watch back your own high score, to either show off, or to see how you did it, but anyone on the visible leaderboard will have a replay available of the run that put them there in the first place, enabling you to study those ahead of you simply by clicking an icon. It's a brilliant package, but understandably not for everyone. The steep difficulty paired with the admittedly low amount of content will be enough to put some off, and that is understandable, but at five dollars it's difficult to argue against its value. Wholeheartedly recommended.","February 22","true","18.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

I like how movement based this game is, with the movement feeling smooth and satisfying, bhops and all. Coming from primarily playing the counter-strike series, and enjoying the movement and bhop side of that, devil daggers feel satisfying to just run and jump around while engaging with enemies. The enemies are designed great, and the sound is amazing. Pushing yourself to master the movment and mechanics is satisfying combined with the mood gained as the game progresses into a more demonic mess the further you get, keeps you coming back for more. It really has a mood that can leave you shaking at the end.\n\nSome people complain about this game not having levels, and being too basic to warrent playing, to which I think, A) It's not meant to be that type of game, but more importantly B) This game is more about the movement, mechanics, mood, aesthetics, and skill-testing. No levels are needed for that. And for it's price, this game is definately worth playing. It's good fun!","February 18","true","16.6"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","9","19","0","3"

It shouldn't take long.\n\nHere we have the example of how the greatest can emerge out of simplicity.\nMaybe "simplicity" isn't the right term, as the thought process that led to this masterpiece might have been quite long.\n\nThe goal is to survive the longer you can while under constant attack, now I can see how this wouldn't seem like anything fantastic, but this isn't just your usual invasion mod.\nThe game relays on a couple of precise gameplay concepts that allow a lot of different strategies. Now strategy sounds like a good term to describe the gameplay, as it really consists of crisis management :\n\n- Two firing mode depending on the relative situation between you and the ennemy, keeping the fight close or silencing a problem it from afar before it grows...\n- Some movement patterns to dance around the hypnotising waves of ennemies, and a couple of aerial tricks to escape desperate situations, and let you feel cool & hardcore.\n- Some items with a short life span that will have you anticipate your next moves... Depending on the emergency of your situation.\n\nSo basically there's plenty of ways to do it, and it really depends on you not let each game look like an other.\nIf you don't know what to do, you can allways watch the best replays from the global scoreboard and lear some tips. Gotta say some of them are quite impressive...\n\nI obviously recommand this brillant game to anyone into arcade games or fast action fps.\n\nBtw the atmosphere and sound design is perfect.","February 20","true","12.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The gameplay remind me a lot of Downwell, especially in how every player action has consequences, but without feeling like you were cheated; if I failed, it was my own fault and not the game being unfair or random. It looks deceptively simple, but there's tons of skill needed to succeed.\n\nWhat I love the most is the use of spatial positioning and awareness, or complete lack thereof. The use of audio is really the only thing that will give players any type of spatial awareness, and by limiting it so much by placing the player in a dark arena with no visual distinction, the repeated enemy spawn patterns don't come off as boring, at all. You know what to expect, but at the same time you don't.

Has the pixely texture qualities of DOOM but the somewhat simple model geometry of QUAKE (its actually more complex but feels classic).\n\nIt's super tough and made me hate it.\nBut it dumps you back in for another run so fast it's hard to stop.\n\nValue really depends on what you can get out of what is really a completely repetitive game where you are just trying to live as long as you can. At this time the longest run is around 8 minutes. Average runs are around 1 minute.\n\nBut again, it's super tough and made me hate it.\nBut I can't stop...","February 20","true","1.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's a simple game where the few moving parts are made beautifully.  You have one gun, the Devil Daggers, that can fire like a shotgun or machinegun.  You shoot the weakpoints and collect them to upgrade your fingers. WASD movement.  Survive long enough to get on the leaderboards.  That's it.\n\nExcept that isn't just it.\n\nIt's a game about making a million binary choices every second.\n\nThe first enemies you face are a tower that spews a swarm of fast moving skulls and one bigger one that just kind of runs away.  Do you destroy the tower quickly, or clear the mobs first?  Depends on the moment. Destroy a few and a massive skull spider shows up.  You need to destroy it quickly or it'll send out a bunch of spider hatchlings.  But wait, the larger skulls from earlier just flipped over, have 5 times the health, are chasing you now, and are cackling maniacly.  Do you destroy the laughing skulls and risk the spiders hatching?\n\nMaybe you just want to run away.  Game's got you covered.  You can bunnyhop easily by jumping every time you hit the ground, making you slightly faster than the swarms of skulls.  Of course, then you can't turn easily.  Do you want to risk bunnyhopping when it could lead you into a swarm you could easily avoid on foot, or will the speed be your best bet at the moment?  Need to just go backwards as fast as possible?  Or possibly up?  Use the shotgun blast to rocketjump.  You got away!  Of course, you might accidentally launch yourself off the edge of the arena.  Is going backwards worth that risk?\n\nSee?  Just a bunch of simple risk/reward choices.  But you only have one health, so every choice matters.  And even the first enemy makes you make 3 of those decisions the moment you set eyes on it.  Should I bunnyhop towards it or not? Should I shoot the crystal to destroy the tower or focus on the swarms.  Should I try and kill the larger skull it spawned that's leaving me alone at this moment?\n\nAnd every enemy just starts piling these choices on.\n\nMore and more.\n\nFaster and faster.\n\nIt's the risk/reward of Galaga with the graphics of what Quake wanted to be.\n\nIf you like arcade games:  GET THIS.\n\n\nP.S.  The ability to download and watch the replay of anyone above you on the leaderboard makes improvement much easier.  Great feature.","February 18","true","2.8"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Get touched once, you die. Rinse and repeat, each time getting a higher score, or just dying in the first 30 seconds because that skull should not have been there!

I just bought this game on a whim and I'm happy to say that I've become completely enthralled in Devil Daggers' breakneck shooter gameplay. With the industry's current state of being oversaturated with sponge shooters, Devil Daggers' would've been heaven-sent if it didn't happen to also be so devilishly impious. Devil Daggers is a visual feast to say the least, which is interesting considering my initial reaction of there only being "13 horrifying enemies" as skeptical of the longevity that number would normally imply; but, I'm happy to say that such worries were immediately put to rest when I found myself confronted by the first 4 horrifying demons, as each are beautifully designed while also being HR Giger levels of ghastly.\nI'm not normally one for Arena Shooters, but I was somehow immediately taken by Devil Daggers. Perhaps it was its $5 price tag, it's unique and nightmarish aesthetics, or its fluid and fine-tuned controls; regardless, I'd say it's certainly worth its price of admission.","February 18","true","2.4"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

I was afraid the "low-res" textures and art style would become tiring or strain my vision, but after playing this game almost two hours straight I haven't had to worry about it.\n\nSimply put, if you watched the trailer and aren't totally appalled by the game's art style, and you like fast, fluid, buttery-smooth FPS action, you need Devil Daggers.","February 19","true","4.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

The clacking, wailing, screeching horrors of this game sort of trigger something deep in the recesses of my lizard brain. I guess it seems to me sort of like a game from a pearl-clutching anti-gaming TV movie. Like what Joe Leiberman or Hillary Clinton thought all games were. It has such a dark, foreboding, violent quality to it and it's so addictive that it's like what normies used to think gamers played all the time, back when being a 'gamer' was something to be ridiculed and not hip and trendy. People often compare it to Quake, which I suppose isn't entirely unfair, although Quake never gave me anywhere near the adrenaline rush Devil Daggers does. The fact that I only bought it a few days ago and I've already spent almost three hours playing a game in which I have yet to last longer than two minutes in a single session certainly illustrates something about the grip it's got on me.\n\nBeyond all that, it's ridiculously well-designed in pretty much every way. 'Retro' is a big thing in gaming recently, and I usually hate it, but I've never seen anyone do it precisely this way. It's interesting that the PSX is probably the biggest reference point for me in terms of the software-rendered visual style this game revels in, since at the time the PSX was big I didn't have one. I only bought one near the end of its life cycle. During the heyday of the PSX, I was gaming on a high-end PC with a 3D accelerator, and sneering at all my friends who only had consoles. Had this been an exclusive, as so often happened in those days, this would have been one of the ones that would slap that sneer off my face. This game wears its visual style well, and it's perfectly suited to the dull color palette of the game and its various nightmarish creatures.\n\nThe sound, as noted by many, is a thing of glory. It reminds me of games even older than the controversial games of my childhood, games I never got to see in an arcade, like Battlezone or Missile Command or Tempest with their thumps and drones and throbs. Tempest can probably even be viewed as a distant ancestor of this game in more than a few ways. I can just imagine Devil Daggers' nightmarish cracklings, grindings, and wails seething through mall arcades somewhere in the depths of the mid-90s. If someone ever cared to port this to a cabinet, it would be more than worth it.\n\nLike the best arcade games, the gameplay itself is ridiculously simple to pick up and horrifically complex to even be competent at, much less master. The weapon you wield is powerful, but if you stop moving or lose focus for even a second, it can mean death. There are so many different intermixing strategies for dealing with the various monsters that have to be balanced and combined at all times to have any chance of success, you have to empty your mind before the onslaught begins. And I wish I hadn't accidentally read about the jewel power-ups, because I feel like I unintentionally cheated. Figuring out how that worked on my own would have caused me to get wrecked even more often than I did when initially starting, and I would have enjoyed coming to the conclusion organically.\n\nI guess one of my only complaints about this game, and don't interpret this as a refusal to git gud, because I'm certainly working on it, is that echolocation, the ability to gauge the positions of things based on sound, plays a massive role in staying alive from moment to moment even beyond figuring out and managing the interlocking strategies required to deal with the different monsters. Not a huge problem, except that not everyone is equal in terms of the ability to echolocate, so some sort of map or at least proximity indicator apart from just sound or the monsters turning orange wouldn't have been a terrible option.\n\nTL;DR it's great. If you like arcade games or are nostalgic for the kind of graphics on display or just the kind of guy or girl who wants to beat everyone's time and show us all how inferior we are, buy it. As someone mentioned in the discussion, if you played it in an arcade, your money would be gone in five minutes and you'd still walk out pumped up, covered in sweat, squinting at the light of the outside world, and smiling ear to ear. You may not do that irl ever again, if you live in Murrica at least, but this can get you somewhere close to that sublime euphoria.","March 8","true","12.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

There are so many different intermixing strategies for dealing with the various monsters that have to be balanced and combined at all times to have any chance of success, you have to empty your mind before the onslaught begins. And I wish I hadn't accidentally read about the jewel power-ups, because I feel like I unintentionally cheated. Figuring out how that worked on my own would have caused me to get wrecked even more often than I did when initially starting, and I would have enjoyed coming to the conclusion organically.\n\nI guess one of my only complaints about this game, and don't interpret this as a refusal to git gud, because I'm certainly working on it, is that echolocation, the ability to gauge the positions of things based on sound, plays a massive role in staying alive from moment to moment even beyond figuring out and managing the interlocking strategies required to deal with the different monsters. Not a huge problem, except that not everyone is equal in terms of the ability to echolocate, so some sort of map or at least proximity indicator apart from just sound or the monsters turning orange wouldn't have been a terrible option.\n\nTL;DR it's great. If you like arcade games or are nostalgic for the kind of graphics on display or just the kind of guy or girl who wants to beat everyone's time and show us all how inferior we are, buy it. As someone mentioned in the discussion, if you played it in an arcade, your money would be gone in five minutes and you'd still walk out pumped up, covered in sweat, squinting at the light of the outside world, and smiling ear to ear. You may not do that irl ever again, if you live in Murrica at least, but this can get you somewhere close to that sublime euphoria.","March 8","true","12.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I would like to see something more in the area in which you fight, like small obstacles or walls, because like this it tends to get repetitive.\n\nGAMEPLAYYour goal is to survive an endless wave of monsters for as long as you can. Your only weapon is an unlimited amount of daggers that you shoot from your hand. The longer you play, more monsters start appearing, and you unlock some bonuses for your attack. You can also bunnyhop to gain more speed.\nThis is literally the entire game. It's simple, straight-forward and hard to master. It does get very repetitive after a while, and it works better in short game sessions.\n\nCHALLENGEThe game is tough as nails: you die with one hit by either getting hit by enemies, running into them, or falling off the map. Only masochists and hardcore Quake fans will really enjoy playing this game.\n\nSOUNDThe sound design is pretty solid, however it does lack a lot in music and you will easily get annoyed by the constant throwing of daggers and monster noises after a bunch of minutes.\n\nREPLAYABILITYYou also want to play another time, just to get a higher score. But you probably won't. It gets very frustrating, but if you like to get better scores every time you will most definitely spend hours and hours mastering this game.\n\nOverall, fans of endless shooters will have a blast playing this game, and for its cheap price I do recommend it.

I would love to see more projects with this engine.\n\n+ This is one of the few single player FPS that ask the player to track and lead a moving target.  Usually, this kind of mechanic is limited to multiplayer games, such as Tribes or Dirty Bomb.  Shooting moving skulls is satisfying.\n\n- The gameplay area takes place on a relatively small platform.  As a result, the game is not allowed to increase the enemy count as much as it could.\n\n- The dodging is overly simplistic.  For the most part, you are dodging variations of homing "projectiles".   The core dodging gameplay is just not very satisfying.  (For a good example of FPS dodging, check out Ziggurat, which combines many projectiles of different types the way that a SHMUP does, and Doom.)\nThe uninteresting dodging is the primary reason why I am not inspired to try and master Devil Daggers.\n\n- The game presents a lot of motionless targets (Pillars, spiders) which are not fun to kill.\n\n- The early stage becomes a drag once you have memorized the spawns.   I'm not a fan of the spawns being the same on every run.\n\n- Even when bunny hopping, the game feels a bit slow.","March 28","false","8.3"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","5","14","0","9"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ElyCyan/recommended/422970/","ElyCyan","ElyCyan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ElyCyan/","578 products in account","TL;DR Game is hard but not engaging. It feels nothing like Doom/Quake - the ONLY weapon you get is boring to use, there isn't a proper level to run through (just a wide open room), and the beginning enemies are so monotonous that you won't feel a drive to even excel at the game. If you want a hard FPS throwback game with a bit of roguelite, I'd recommend Ziggurat, Tower of Guns, Paranautical Activity or just go to the source and get Doom and Quake.\n\nDevil Daggers might claim to be inspired by 1990s FPS games, but make no mistake: this is nothing like Doom or Quake.\n\nYou're dropped onto a wide open circle of ground and enemies spawn randomly on the edge, spewing tons of flying skulls when they do. If you get hit once, you die. There is nowhere to hide and the area is dark so some enemies will be hidden in that darkness. In Doom/Quake, a lot of the gunplay came from moving quickly through cooridors, finding secrets, ducking in and out of doorway cover and being surprised by a monster closet opening behind you. This game only spawns monsters around you with very little fanfare, and you'll spend most of your time simply bunny hopping and circle strafing. That's it. This might be a fluid movement system but it does not supply an enjoyable nor interesting space to use it in.\n\nThe difficulty is very high, as you'd expect. I can appreciate one-hit difficulty, but frequently you'll die because something spawned behind you without much or any warning, or one lone skull did a Tokyo drift and nipped your ankle, or something else altogether. The game won't give you feedback about WHY you died. Probably a lone enemy snuck up on you? Who knows. There are tons of floating skulls everywhere but it simply isn't fun or interesting to fight them or die to them. In the end, the game killing you doesn't feel frustrating or terribly unfair really - it's just kind of boring.\n\nThe only weapon you get is the devil daggers. If you click mouse-1, you have a weak shotgun attack that is nothing like the boomstick from Doom. It feels like a nerf gun. If you HOLD mouse-1, you get a minigun like weapon that actually does feel good to use.  I don't know why they chose to tie these firing modes to the same button (you can't remap this either!) - it feels clumsy to use and it often will not work at all, simply giving you a one shot from the minigun instead of the shotgun. Combining the weakness of the shotgun shot with the unreliability of the controls, I'm not sure why you'd bother to use it. Apparently the game gives you homing daggers for mouse-2 at SOME point, but I honestly never played enough to get there before I got extremely bored.\n\nNormally in difficult games, you'll have a desire to get better at the game, to learn from your mistakes, and last a bit longer next time. I didn't have that feeling in this game. The gun (dagger?) play felt so dull that I just accepted each death and tried again. 45 minutes later, I felt like I only got marginally better but had no desire to try again. There are 10 more enemy types that I never got to see, but I simply don't care enough to play longer to get to that content. I also never got any double jump, nor homing daggers, or any upgrade.\n\nFinally, you can watch replays of the top scores on the leaderboards, so you can watch people who have mastery over the game play. It's a lot of circle strafing and holding mouse-1. Not the most riveting gameplay to watch, but you can appriciate how good these people are at the game. I'm just not sure why they feel driven to achieve that mastery when it just doesn't seem interesting to get there. There are better, deeper games out there that fill this niche.\n","February 18","false","0.5"," 124 of 267 people (46%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","46","124","267","6","24"

It has a familiar aesthetic to the original Quake and intentionally tries to resemble an old software renderer.\n\nHowever the game plays much more like a first person bullet hell where you dodge projectiles while continuously firing. There isn't really any overall objective beyond staying alive longer and eventually unlocking more projectiles. There is also very little additional content beyond additional monsters and projectile attacks. You still inhabit the same square space dodging the same projectiles over and over, and if you die you restart.\n\nTo be honest I kind of feel very disappointed with this game. I feel more in-love with the idea of a new Quake-style game in the modern day than I do playing a first person bullet hell. You can agree or disagree but I just wish the developer spent more time with it and fashioned actual levels and a goal to the game.","March 13","false","0.3"," 8 of 24 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","8","24","0","5"

Only positive is the graphics/sound. But that doesn't make a game fun. Barely worth $1, let alone 5. Requesting refund because this game is offensively bad.

Developer has no business asking money for something this bad / devoid of actual content.\n\nYou can summarize the entire experience just by watching the intro video. That's it. There is no more to the game. No levels, just complete wave after wave of non-stop one hit kill punishment in an empty black room.\n\nYou know what would make this game good? Take the graphics and make a Heretic/Hexen clone. THAT would be old-school. CO-OP would also be a requirement.\n\nThe Rogue-like genre is dead. It's nothing more than an excuse for lazy game development. The few games that pulled it off are the exception, not the norm, as the other garbage titles have discredited the genre as stereotypical money grabs by fedora wearing indie dev hipsters.\n\nStop making these content-less products, and make actual games. You're diluting the market with crap, and future generations will not know what to buy having to sift through THOUSANDS of junk titles, while the classics like Doom, Heretic, Hexen, and Descent get overlooked. Steam needs a curation system that can make these type of games disappear permanently for people who don't want to see them. If you want to make a Tech Demo, make a Tech Demo. Just don't charge money for it, and don't call it a game.\n\nI'm ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off because I was misled into thinking this was a retro clone like Hexen. It's not.

The graphics and engine and movement are inspired by classics such as Quake and Doom and it looks absolutely outstanding.\n\nUnfortunately, that's where my praise ends.  It says I've only played 0.3 hours, but it requires less time than that to explore the features of the game outside of the need to keep practicing the game to get better to hopefully make it to the end.\n\n*edit: I spent 2 more hours on this game to get into the top 10% of the leaderboard (at the time) and to make another video because I was unfair in the one I linked here.  My opinion is unchanged.\n\nFrankly, there isn't anywhere close to 5 dollars worth of content in this game.  You get one relatively small arena with no physical obstacles, no differentiation in how the game begins, with one gun that supposedly upgrades as you proceed (though admittedly I'm not good enough to get that far).  You know what else you can get for 5 dollars?  The Binding of Isaac.\n\nThere is a replay feature that you can find from the leaderboards to see how the best of the best get through it, which is actually pretty cool.  That's a feature I'd love to see in more games in some capacity.\n\nI can respect what this game wants to do with its movement and its graphical style and its engine and I think all that is really cool, but it simply needs more.  One arena with one gun with one set of waves simply is not enough.  What really confuses me is how this game currently has over 90 positive reviews singing its praises and only 7 negative reviews that are constantly being flagged as "unhelpful" for some reason.  It almost seems a little bit sketchy, as I've seen better games get ♥♥♥♥ on for less.\n\nAlso, there is no invert mouse option.  In 2016, there's no invert mouse option in a first person shooter.  Ridiculous.\n\nI made a video for this game, which you can see here if you'd like to see the gameplay in action:\nhttps://youtu.be/kggCdt2GYc8\n\nKey was provided by the developer and Dietrich Online Services. I'd have thought this game would be a fun little time waster for a dollar, but if I had spent my own money on this at 5 dollars I would have been profoundly disappointed and demanded a refund.","February 19","false","2.3"," 28 of 70 people (40%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","40","28","70","3","11"

But it just doesnt meet it.\n\nWhy?\n\nIt says it has 13 enemies.  But.... it kinda feels like it doesnt.\n\nYou're going to fight skulls.  The same skulls.  Over and over and over and over again.   All they do is chase you.  Nothing more.  You will do this, and attack the skull generators, OVER AND OVER again, EVERY time you die and restart the game.  Make ONE tiny mistake?  Hey, fight more skulls for 5 minutes.   And the skulls are BORING.  They dont really provide a challenge; they JUST take forever to get rid of.   And then you get to the interesting enemies, where it's not JUST skulls and skull-makers, and then you die, and then OH GOODY MORE SKULLS AGAIN.   It feels like the game runs out of ideas the instant it begins.  And it's not like the skull-makers themselves are hard to kill; they spin very, very slowly, are huge, dont move, and have a big glowing weak-spot and little health.  Run at them and pop them, simple.  Then shoot a billion skulls for awhile.\n\nAs I said on the forum, I'd kill for a "just skip the boring skulls and get to the INTERESTING stuff" button.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with an arcade-ish game that kills you really quickly; Robotron 2084 proved this back at arcades 30 years ago.  But there IS something wrong with an arcade-ish game that kills you really quickly... but only after boring you for a few minutes straight FIRST, every single freaking time.  TECHNICALLY it doesnt take THAT long to pass the skulls; but it sure FEELS like it, and that's NOT a good thing.\n\nI'm going to keep messing with it further because I'm stubborn as hell and not ready to give up on it yet, so we'll see what happens and it's possible I may reverse this review later (I've done that before, this is why I make sure to keep playing things for awhile even after posting a negative review, just in case), but... I think this one is likely going to end up not changing my mind.\n\nOh, and I've played this for longer than it says; spent some time with it at a friend's house earlier before then buying it on here.  I'd already sorta seen the problem when I was playing it at his place, but I figured I should spend a bit more time with it before reviewing or posting about it.  But coming back to it... same skulls, same experience.\n\nThis would be GREAT if it just randomized things a bit. Make it so that you dont know what combination of foes is going to pop up at the start every time!  Instead of ALWAYS the same thing....

Come on devs, you should know by now that if we wanted some kind of retro gaming throwback you would give us something akin to the Power Rangers game on the SNES, or Superfrog on the Amiiga. The playstation 1 era was in that weird awkward age were video games weren't exactly pixels, but weren't exactly polygons either. Back in the day they called these things "voxels" and holy jeez they are a mess to look at.\n\nThe art style of this game even when you ignore the horrible graphics is just atrocious. I know we're shooting at demons and that's somewhat ok for someone who is catholic like me, but the player seems to be a disembodied demon hand regardless, so even if I am killing demons I am still a demon in the game...\n\nThere is something deeply wrong with games these days when they need to cash in on fringe wants like "playstation 1 era graphics" or catering to the demonic youth of today's pop music generation. This game needs to die.","March 4","false","0.1"," 5 of 30 people (17%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","17","5","30","4","11"

Asteroids, too. It's about on par with Pong.\n\nDoes Devil Daggers play well? Sure it does. But it's much easier to make what is barely 1/10 of a level for most games balanced and smooth when that's all you have to worry about.\n\nIf you want a "time attack" game with zero content, this fits the bill - BARELY. And $1 would be a better price. But the devs could have fleshed it out and used the basic mechanics to create a new classic (a la Doom/Hexen/and many other obvious inspirations) that would be remembered in 100 years. Instead we got a flash-in-the-pan game of the week. The "if it's hard it must be  good crowd" will defend this game until their (many) deaths.\n\nCranking the difficulty up to 100000 doesn't mean that a game is well made. Maybe it is, but there's no way to know when the whole game world is one small square. If the first level of Doom was a one-hit kill arena that threw monsters at you endlessly it would not still be revered (and being made) today. Making games ultra-hard to artificially make them seem longer or somehow better is annoying. That's why real games (like Doom) have "Nightmare" mode. Best of both worlds.\n\nGFX-wise I love the style, but it often impedes playability. The pixelation gets really bad with so many enemies on screen and the 2ft draw distance make death from falling and unseen enemies/projectiles feel cheap.\n\nSummary: It's fine for what it is- a time attack demo, should only cost $1, and feels like a waste as whoever made it is talented but apparently not interested in making a full game. Maybe this is a better option, $$-wise.\n\nI bought is, played it a couple hours and shelved it. And I LOVE Geometry Wars, been playing it for ywars. So it's not the format- it's the game. It's not complelling, the artstyle gets old quick and deaths are often cheap because of said style. That never, ever happens in Geometry Wars.","May 1","false","1.3"," 2 of 25 people (8%) found this review helpful","8","2","25","0","2"

If your entire life depends on shooting something that appears in front of you, or will prevent you from reasonably progressing, then the ♥♥♥♥ you fire damn well better damage the thing and not pass harmlessly through it.\n\nEdit: So much hate over pointing out flaws in a product I otherwise like (BTW: well over 100 sec on my highest run.)

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Necropants/recommended/422970/","Necropants","Necropants","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Necropants/","470 products in account","Devil daggers is a supercharged shooter that is very close to games like the original quake in terms of speed and super hexigon due to difficulty. The game itself just starts up with you standing in front of a dagger and once you pick it up you are immidiately attacked by an array of 3 types of enemies which only get more and more difficult as the timer goes on, it can be extremely difficult for some people to even pass the 60 second mark.\n\nOutside of that the game has no story, no secrets (unless you count figuring out how the game mechanics work) and nothing but the challenge of the game. In that respect it is a lot like super hexagon where the whole game is centered around beating your friends highscores and beating your own previous score. It should be said though, that the enemies do become predictable after some time and often you can tell immidiately when the new enemies are going to spawn so once you play the game a whole lot the beginning can become a bit tiring as you face the same pattern of beginning enemies again and again.\n\nAltough i cannot verify one thing it does feel like the game is always using the same random seed per session, so you will always face the same pattern of enemies every round, i would count down the seconds between each enemy spawn because i had been repeating the same pattern over and over (3 spawners, 1 super spawner and then the skull spider with more super spawners).\n\nHowever, despite that i have to say the game is exactly what i expected it to be when i got it and as such i am enjoying the nailbiting difficulty of it and i will probably play until i reach a point where i simply cannot beat my previous score.\n\nPros:\n- Really addicting and makes you want to constantly beat your previous score.\n- High speed movement and twitchy shooting makes the skill ceiling extremely high (tip: you can shotgun blast yourself up into the air)\n- The enemies are varied and are a constant challenge, however you can learn their patterns quite quickly\n- You will always want to dethrone your friends high score\n\nNeutral points:\n- From what i've noticed the game seed is always the same. I cannot verify this but whenever i play the enemy spawn is always the same so learning patterns is sometimes part of the challenge.\n\nCons:\n- Everything you see in the trailer is all there is in the game. There are no secrets, no story no nothing so if you get bored of the base game then there is nothing to hook you back in\n- There is no fov slider and altough the fov is not bad it can still cause some people motion sickness and cause it so you can't see enemies coming from the side.","February 21","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The learning curve is steep, but fair and quite rewarding once mastered. Simply put, it's a game about survival against giant floating skulls, weird spiders, centipedes and all sort of great nightmarish entities. You have two attacks: a constant stream and a shotgun burst that can be upgraded upon picking up red gems. Simple enough premise, but the execution is where the game shines. The Quake-like controls are very quick to respond and work well with shotgun-attack jumping (a'la rocket boosting in a way) and movement akin to bunnyhopping. The game requires as much patience and management of enemies as it does technical skill to land the shots.\n\nI like the simple premise with tantalizing skill ceiling, and for $5 it's a price that seems quite justified. The leaderboards are a great learning tool for those wishing to ascend its ranks. The aspect of being able to watch people's replays very quickly and see what strategies they employ is quite helpful and pretty entertaining as well.","April 15","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In the end, I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would. Certainly worth its price, though, hence the positive rating.\n\nPros:\n+ Brilliant aesthetics. I loved both graphics and sound.\n+ Feels great to play. Satisfying weapons, satisfying controls, satisfying enemy deaths.\n\nCons:\n- Difficulty spikes. 99% of my games ended at between 40 and 50 seconds, where there's a sudden spike. I knew I had to find a strategy that worked to proceed, but after a while it got so tiresome I couldn't make myself continue playing. (My best is just 87 seconds.)\n- One too few weapon options.\n- Feels like you see everything there is to it in under a couple of minutes.\n- There are nice audio tells for enemies attacking off-screen, but, apparently, half of the time they don't work.\n\nI love challenging games. I play lots of retro games, quite a bit of which I master. But one of the thing a truly hard game needs, along with a lot of other stuff, of course, is a steady and even difficulty curve and a steady sense of progressions. When the player loses, it's always good if at the same time it feels like they're learning something. When one plays a game like the 8-bit Ninja Gaiden 3, one might lose a lot and be forced to restart the game, but each time they get a little farther and learn to beat previously beated parts a little more efficiently. This brings a sense of progress that, in my opinion, can often make or break a truly challenging game.","February 23","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Necropants/recommended/422970/","Necropants","Necropants","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Necropants/","470 products in account","Devil daggers is a supercharged shooter that is very close to games like the original quake in terms of speed and super hexigon due to difficulty. The game itself just starts up with you standing in front of a dagger and once you pick it up you are immidiately attacked by an array of 3 types of enemies which only get more and more difficult as the timer goes on, it can be extremely difficult for some people to even pass the 60 second mark.\n\nOutside of that the game has no story, no secrets (unless you count figuring out how the game mechanics work) and nothing but the challenge of the game. In that respect it is a lot like super hexagon where the whole game is centered around beating your friends highscores and beating your own previous score. It should be said though, that the enemies do become predictable after some time and often you can tell immidiately when the new enemies are going to spawn so once you play the game a whole lot the beginning can become a bit tiring as you face the same pattern of beginning enemies again and again.\n\nAltough i cannot verify one thing it does feel like the game is always using the same random seed per session, so you will always face the same pattern of enemies every round, i would count down the seconds between each enemy spawn because i had been repeating the same pattern over and over (3 spawners, 1 super spawner and then the skull spider with more super spawners).\n\nHowever, despite that i have to say the game is exactly what i expected it to be when i got it and as such i am enjoying the nailbiting difficulty of it and i will probably play until i reach a point where i simply cannot beat my previous score.\n\nPros:\n- Really addicting and makes you want to constantly beat your previous score.\n- High speed movement and twitchy shooting makes the skill ceiling extremely high (tip: you can shotgun blast yourself up into the air)\n- The enemies are varied and are a constant challenge, however you can learn their patterns quite quickly\n- You will always want to dethrone your friends high score\n\nNeutral points:\n- From what i've noticed the game seed is always the same. I cannot verify this but whenever i play the enemy spawn is always the same so learning patterns is sometimes part of the challenge.\n\nCons:\n- Everything you see in the trailer is all there is in the game. There are no secrets, no story no nothing so if you get bored of the base game then there is nothing to hook you back in\n- There is no fov slider and altough the fov is not bad it can still cause some people motion sickness and cause it so you can't see enemies coming from the side.","February 21","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Enemies are really creepy when you hear them chasing you. You can hear crystals being pulled towards you, which gives you the choice to stop shooting for a moment and become stronger or keep on fighting.\n\nThe gameplay can be frustrating if you keep getting impaled by that nasty horned skull, but also very satisfying if you do manage to overpower the hordes and survive for just a few second longer.\n\nYou will get better at this game, it is tough but rewarding.","February 21","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While the game is more complex than it appears at a glance, the amount of content here is obviously slim.\n\nwhile you might think objective is  just a "shoot everything, dont get hit", there are a few cool things that you need to learn to make this possible, like what to kill, what not to kill, how to kill certain targets efficiently and how to avoid getting hit. Its hard, and the replays available from your friends or global high scores will make it look easy.\n\nThis game is hell. Its really damn good, but the only issue i have with it is that there isnt enough stuff! the setting is really intriguing and i want to know more about it. I want different levels or something.

Movement is simply on point, and the noises made by hitting enemies or making them pop is satisfying. A really cool touch is that as you get more and more powerful the daggers you shoot will be screaming. It’s a subtle touch that adds to the pure chaos going on in later stages.\n\nIt’s an addictive game that’s sunk its teeth in to many already, and I’m not ashamed to say I’m one of its victims. It’s a game that requires you to pay attention and learn the patterns of enemies as well as your own tactics to use against them.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Necropants/recommended/422970/","Necropants","Necropants","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Necropants/","470 products in account","Devil daggers is a supercharged shooter that is very close to games like the original quake in terms of speed and super hexigon due to difficulty. The game itself just starts up with you standing in front of a dagger and once you pick it up you are immidiately attacked by an array of 3 types of enemies which only get more and more difficult as the timer goes on, it can be extremely difficult for some people to even pass the 60 second mark.\n\nOutside of that the game has no story, no secrets (unless you count figuring out how the game mechanics work) and nothing but the challenge of the game. In that respect it is a lot like super hexagon where the whole game is centered around beating your friends highscores and beating your own previous score. It should be said though, that the enemies do become predictable after some time and often you can tell immidiately when the new enemies are going to spawn so once you play the game a whole lot the beginning can become a bit tiring as you face the same pattern of beginning enemies again and again.\n\nAltough i cannot verify one thing it does feel like the game is always using the same random seed per session, so you will always face the same pattern of enemies every round, i would count down the seconds between each enemy spawn because i had been repeating the same pattern over and over (3 spawners, 1 super spawner and then the skull spider with more super spawners).\n\nHowever, despite that i have to say the game is exactly what i expected it to be when i got it and as such i am enjoying the nailbiting difficulty of it and i will probably play until i reach a point where i simply cannot beat my previous score.\n\nPros:\n- Really addicting and makes you want to constantly beat your previous score.\n- High speed movement and twitchy shooting makes the skill ceiling extremely high (tip: you can shotgun blast yourself up into the air)\n- The enemies are varied and are a constant challenge, however you can learn their patterns quite quickly\n- You will always want to dethrone your friends high score\n\nNeutral points:\n- From what i've noticed the game seed is always the same. I cannot verify this but whenever i play the enemy spawn is always the same so learning patterns is sometimes part of the challenge.\n\nCons:\n- Everything you see in the trailer is all there is in the game. There are no secrets, no story no nothing so if you get bored of the base game then there is nothing to hook you back in\n- There is no fov slider and altough the fov is not bad it can still cause some people motion sickness and cause it so you can't see enemies coming from the side.","February 21","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No tutorials, no boring ♥♥♥ cutscenes or dialogue to suffer through. This is a game where you have to learn everything yourself unless of course you look up directions.\n\nVisuals -\nA nice retro 90's shooter aesthetic made on a completely custom engine the devs built.\nEnemies are demonic and creepy with some really nice touches. The giant spider who sucks in gems is especially scary.\nThe level is nothing more than a flat piece of land with repeating textures with an abyss of blackness around it.\n\n7/10. Would be higher if the ground had a little more to it, but I appreciate it for what it is.\n\nAudio -\nEverything is a creepy crunchy, crackle and ambient sound. As you progress through the game and new enemies appear, they make different sounds. Each enemy makes a unique sound so you know what to be aware of. Your hand that shoots "Devil Daggers" at the start make a low hum but as you progress gets louder into a screeching almost screaming sound, like tortured souls of hell.\n\n10/10. I know that seems generous but it has been quite some time since a game has blown me away with the audio.\n\nGameplay -\nThe game is about as simple as it it gets. You spawn in and shoot enemies, however, you also have other objectives to be aware of. The floating pillars for example spawn the flying enemies who chase you down to kill you. If you do not kill the pillars they will keep spawning enemies over and over. The game is also set with a timer that always spawns set pieces of different enemies so if you don't take out the pillars they will keep spawning as the game progresses. Getting the red gems upgrades your Devil Dagger arm and those are absolutely crucial if you want to progress, so you have to always be collecting whilst killing. Each enemy moves differently and has different weak points so you have to be quick with you aiming and skillful as well. This game is VERY DIFFICULT.\n\n5/10. The gameplay is fantastic but suffers from a repetitive feel after so long, but when you pick it back up after a break it feels fresh again. The ranking leaderboards also keep you striving to get further.\n\nOVERALL - The game is a breath of fresh air do to its dark art style and excellent sound design. It takes your traditional horde type gameplay and adds in horror and desperation making you feel the adrenaline as you get firther along. Fun in short burts but lacks long term playing due to no level design. I'd recommend this game only to those who strive for leaderboards or a challenge, anyone who is looking to shoot and go through waves with relative ease or enjoy a more slow paced game should skip this.\n\nFINAL SCORE - 6/10.","February 21","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is very simple and thus very easy understand - but mastering the game  takes alot of skill.\n\nThe game takes place in a hellish arena (very quake-esque) that spawns hordes of demons at you (in a pattern that is very slightly randomized) and your task is to kill anything that moves. The challenge of the game is to survive the demon horde as long as possible. This is easier said than done since you die from one hit (herein lie the rogue-lite elements). The game is very fast paced and very fun movement-wise - you can for instance perform something called a "dagger jump", which basically is a rocket jump, and it does seem like you gain some momentum by continously jumping (not sure though).\nThe music in the game is great (only plays in the menu). It brings back memories of Alone in The Dark and the old Resident Evil games. The sound design in general is actually very good. Everything really does sound hellish. The demons sound scary, the weapon sounds terrifying, the big spider skull enemy actually makes me uneasy. Different demons emit different sounds which makes it easier to telegrapgh where they are relative to your own position.\n\nThere are some issues woth the game though. The sound design is, as I just said, very good. Butt some sound effects blend in a little too much. There is a mechanic in the game where you have to collect red gems in order to upgrade your weapon. The game does not present how many gems you have collected (you need 10 for the first upgrade) and you have to count them yourself by listening to the little thump-like sound when they are picked up. However this sound effect is far from clear and it blends in with the background noise a little too easily.\nSecondly the game lacks a proper options menu. The game would really benefit from some visual settings. Furthermore the games performance is rather iffy at times. I have an i5 4690k and an R9 280x and for some reason the game slows down a lot at times and at other times the game runs super smooth. It might very well be an isolated case.\nLastly the game only features one weapon (I'm not even sure what to call it). The weapon is upgradable, sure, but the upgrades don't really change all that much and it can get a little boring using the same gun over and over again.\n\nI do recommend this game because I feel that I got my money worth and for 5 dollars you could do a hell of a lot worse.","March 28","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gunplay is fast, agile, accurate, difficult and satisfying. It does involve repeating the same level over and over and over again, but everytime you survive 1 second longer than your last high score, you feel like a badass.\nSound design is perfect, enemy designs are very creative and hellish. The only achievement in the game is pretty much a badge of badassery that you get after surviving long enough. The low price and addictive gameplay make this game and instant reccomendation if you like FPS games and challenging gameplay.","April 9","true","17.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I didn't need that soul anyway.\n\nSerious review: After much thought, I honestly can't decide where to start with this review, so I'll be using the pros/cons style.\n\nPros:-Fast paced and exciting combat\n-Challenging, but not discouraging\n-A leaderboard where you can see your friends and other players' best runs/times\n-You can watch the best players on the leaderboard and maybe learn from their playstyle\n-Amazing sound design (sound cues are memorable, and can help you detect pursuing enemies)\n-Addicting gameplay; I'm always striving to beat my highscore, and to get higher in the leaderboard\n-Very cheap. I have far more expensive games which I've gotten less out of\n-A diverse range of enemies, which you'll learn the weaknesses of as you play\n-Your only weapon adapts as the game progresses. Additionally, it has multiple types of shots, so use the correct one for your situation.\n-Nostalgic graphics and gameplay, much like playing a remaster version of the classic DOOM games\n-A custom engine with beautiful graphic design. It may be simplistic, but it still looks attractive\n-Success requires strategy\n\nCons:-The difficulty might not be for everyone (If you're prone to rage quitting, this game won't be healthy for you.)\n-Sometimes the game feels unfair (but with the right stategy you can succeed, I promise!)\n-requires a decent reaction time\n-I still see the horrors when I close my eyes\n\nPerhaps one of the hardest game's I've ever played, and I've loved every second of it. It has been challenging and exciting. On more than one occassion, upon surpassing my best time, I would find myself shaking so hard I couldn't aim straight, and when I did better than expected, jumping up and laughing with euphoria.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/machina_/recommended/422970/","machina_","Government Man","http://steamcommunity.com/id/machina_/","161 products in account","Devil Daggers is a first person shooter, rogue-lite, geometry wars -type game. The game is very simple and thus very easy understand - but mastering the game  takes alot of skill.\n\nThe game takes place in a hellish arena (very quake-esque) that spawns hordes of demons at you (in a pattern that is very slightly randomized) and your task is to kill anything that moves. The challenge of the game is to survive the demon horde as long as possible. This is easier said than done since you die from one hit (herein lie the rogue-lite elements). The game is very fast paced and very fun movement-wise - you can for instance perform something called a "dagger jump", which basically is a rocket jump, and it does seem like you gain some momentum by continously jumping (not sure though).\nThe music in the game is great (only plays in the menu). It brings back memories of Alone in The Dark and the old Resident Evil games. The sound design in general is actually very good. Everything really does sound hellish. The demons sound scary, the weapon sounds terrifying, the big spider skull enemy actually makes me uneasy. Different demons emit different sounds which makes it easier to telegrapgh where they are relative to your own position.\n\nThere are some issues woth the game though. The sound design is, as I just said, very good. Butt some sound effects blend in a little too much. There is a mechanic in the game where you have to collect red gems in order to upgrade your weapon. The game does not present how many gems you have collected (you need 10 for the first upgrade) and you have to count them yourself by listening to the little thump-like sound when they are picked up. However this sound effect is far from clear and it blends in with the background noise a little too easily.\nSecondly the game lacks a proper options menu. The game would really benefit from some visual settings. Furthermore the games performance is rather iffy at times. I have an i5 4690k and an R9 280x and for some reason the game slows down a lot at times and at other times the game runs super smooth. It might very well be an isolated case.\nLastly the game only features one weapon (I'm not even sure what to call it). The weapon is upgradable, sure, but the upgrades don't really change all that much and it can get a little boring using the same gun over and over again.\n\nI do recommend this game because I feel that I got my money worth and for 5 dollars you could do a hell of a lot worse.","March 28","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
