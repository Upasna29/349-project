I wouldn’t say it’s a challenging game by any means, but there is enough exploring and battling to make it worth a play.\n\nPlot-wise, I was hooked in pretty quickly by the intro, and the rest of the game did a nice job of carrying the story. I always had a pretty good idea of where I was going, and never ran across any problems when I took a little time to explore. A major thing I noticed is that the characters could’ve used a little more development, though. I got enough of a sense of them to understand most of their personalities, but not enough to grow attached to any of them.\n\nAs far as graphics go, this game definitely lands on the better end of what you’ll find in RPG Maker. The mapping, while not always spectacular, was done well, and you can tell there was thought put into each location. There are a lot of little things that enhance the atmosphere, too - footprints in the sand and snow, splashing in the water, etc. - just a few little touches to compliment the scenery. I appreciate that many different packs of graphics were used and combined, so we weren’t stuck staring at the default graphics. The character sprites weren’t anything particularly exciting, but they fit the portraits and settings well.\n\nI had a bit of trouble with battles early on, but that’s on me for not keeping track of equipment upgrades. None of the fights weren’t exactly challenging (I rarely lost a character), but the front-view system was put together well. If things are getting too easy, you also have the option of avoiding enemies or running away, if you want to. I never found the battles tedious enough to run away from, though.\n\nBesides that, the music and sound effects were chosen well, though nothing particularly stood out to me. The attack/battle start sounds do get a bit annoying after a while, but that’s mostly because the same sound is used in a lot of RPG Maker games.\n\nOverall, if you’re looking for a short and sweet RPG, you won’t be disappointed.","January 14","true","7.5"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","0"

Just like the Legionwood series, I was captivated from the start.  I love how the story unfolds, and I'm constantly waiting to see what happens next.  This is so fun to play, and it's never boring in the slightest. I recommend this game to all RPG fans who love good stories with great art and music, fun characters, and easy to learn mechanics.  Right now this feels like an instant classic. I'm looking forward to see how it ends.\n\nAbilities are gained by experience, and there are no random battles. You have the freedom to avoid battles too, if you wish.\n\nThere is some great, great music in this game!  Again, highly recommended!\n\nDefinitely worth it especially at the affordable price.","January 11","true","9.0"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

It is a really fun experience. Nostalgia really hit home as you wonder around in the retro-styled game. If you ever played Pokemon back in the days and enjoyed it, You will enjoy this just as much! So far I do not have anything to complain about except maybe the fact that a mouse is not used in this game. Took me awhile to realise that I had to use the arrow keys in the main menu to navigate it. Besides that, the storyline is very intriguing, and the music is wonderful! Really do enjoy this game!

I like that its not too hard and not too easy to play, so anyone can pick it up and enjoy it. Graphics are pretty and the mapping is nicely made. The music makes me want to sit in one area just to hear the whole tune. The story keeps me wanting to play more. It has some side quests and mini bosses which keeps me playing till i done everything. The controls are easy to get used to.  It also supports controller as well for those that don't like keyboard. I also did a playthrough of it so here is some links to those:\n\nPart 1 : http://www.twitch.tv/chibievil/v/34257732\n\nI have nothing bad to say about it as I enjoyed everything about it.\n\n10/10 would play it again","January 9","true","9.4"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","12","17","0","0"

I like the sci-fi spin on rpg's and this has it in it. It is hard to find a good rpg with mix of fantasy and rpg. This game does it.\n\nI do have one problem though...\n\nthe game seems too short for a rpg. I am usually more used to longer rpg's, but that is my opinion, still , a decent game. I tried to help the developer fix some bugs i found in the game, so i hope that helps everyone in the future.

So make your choices and get into an interesting, imaginative, and absorbing story.\n\nAs you begin you are taken back 2000 years in time to a land called Jastamune to resolve the complications of the conflict taking place ---- not much time to ponder the why, just start the quest through differing locations such as caves, mines, forests, and castles ---- all of which have different treasures and secrets to find. You can fight the battles you choose among the many types of enemies or escape (if you're quick). You'll want to explore very carefully, though, to find all the treasures containing weapons, money, potions, etc.\n\nScenery is beautifully done, and the music is varied and excellent throughout the game.\n\nSo give this one a chance ---- especially at the very reasonable sale price ---- and you'll have a winner.

The story was interesting enough to keep me engaged, and the gameplay was quite fun.\n\nThe story has a time-traveling element to it and I always like those. It may be a bit slow after the intro, but after you get through a few dungeons (which are comfortably short enough), it picks up the pace. The game actually gets better the further you play, and I especially like the scenes toward the end of the game.\n\nBattles were quite fun, despite the simple turn based battle system. Most battles don't last very long, so you won't get bored of fighting. Fights are balanced well, a bit on the easy side but it does have its challenging moments.\nThere are also no random encounters, and encounters are placed around the map instead. This gives you a choice whether you want to fight or not. It makes exploring much more comfortable.\n\nThe spacing of the map areas are also nicely done, it doesn't feel like it's tedious to travel. This is also helped by the fact that enemies are on-map and you can try to run around them but they do chase you! (quite a bit effectively IIRC)\nThe scenery is well-done, various climates from snow fields to deserts. I also like the little details such as effects when you step on certain terrain such as sand or shallow water, and you leave footprints and splash the water, respectively.\n\nThere are a few puzzles here and there which are simple enough to understand (you won't get frustrated), and there are sidequests which include hunting for certain monsters, and they drop valuable equipment. They're quite fun to do.\n\nThe character art is great, and the music sounds beautiful and fits well, especially in the final scenes of the game. That was EPIC.\n\nI suggest to play the game using the highest resolution, so you can see the entirety of the maps and have dialogue efficiently placed (it looks much better that way).\n\nOverall, this is a pretty good RPG Maker game. A simple one, yet fun. I'd recommend to give it a try.","January 13","true","20.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It's thought provoking and while some improvements could be made in character development, it doesn't take too much away from the over all experience\n\nMusic - Now I know this game doesn't have any original pieces but none-the-less, the tracks were well chosen.\n\nRPG Maker - I myself am working on an RPG Maker game, I make this a pro because it's always good to see a decent or good RPG Maker game make it onto steam. Is this the best RPG Maker game? No. But, is it worth the purchase price, sure! You can tell from the mapping and the story that a lot of thought and work went into this title given the engine it was built in.\n\nCons:\nCharacter Development - the game is fairly short, and the orignal was even shorter. The developer did a great job extending the story line for this version of the game but it sometimes feels like the charcters could use more depth and weren't... filler. But, again, not the worst by far out there.\n\nMapping - "Wait, didn't you mention mapping in your pros?" Yes, I did. as good as the mapping is in this game, for a commercial product, and I thought hard about this, it could be better. By that I mean, lighting and atmosphere. It lacks in those departments and I know the power of RPG Maker is limited, but there are solutions to this problem. I suggest the developer to consider some broader techniques for his future projects, especially commercial ones.\n\nBattle System: I personally don't like the battle system as much as others, and the animations are pretty copy and paste. I would prefer to see a little more effort in this portion of an RPG. It's no where near as bad as MANY rpg maker games that I've played, but since this is a commercial product, custom animations and a more unique battle system would have been a nice touch.\n\n\n\nOverall, I recommend this game. Having played the orginal and a couple versions of the current copy, it's not a bad game. The asking price is fair for something that can be finished in 5-7 hours. I'd love to see what the dev can make with a newer engine and some custom resourses!","January 13","true","1.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/428100/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Before establishing Steamified I had many discussions with friends over what I wanted the site to accomplish and what developers and publishers I would like to forge relationships with. One of my closest friends is an RPG aficionado who practically begged me to get Aldorlea Games on board. The publisher, he advised, was one of his favorites because they gave indie RPG developers a chance to be noticed as well as developing some of the more popular and better RPGs on Steam. He pointed out the fact that their Millennium series was one of the more popular RPG franchises on the platform. However, it’s just a simple fact that some developers and publishers take a bit longer to get to work with. Sometimes you need to demonstrate a portfolio before a company will take notice. This was the case with Aldorlea Games. We simply had to put up some quality early content and have some positive feedback from developers and publishers that we were working with before they would come on board. However, once they did come on board with Beyond Reality they have been supportive.\n\nInitially it was an older title that I was hoping to work with – Beyond Reality had yet to be released – so I was taken aback when they asked if we would provide some exposure to their latest title. They decided to jump in from the deep end with us and for that we’re appreciative. Beyond Reality is one of the best titles that Aldorlea Games have published to date. That it is the first game to be developed by EternalShadows Studio speaks volumes to the talent of their developers. The premise of Beyond Reality has you taking on the crew of  the Alpha Omega Company in a game world where science meets magic. You must find the secrets behind the realities of life that your crew has always known in order to put an end to a war, pollution and to rewrite history.\n\nThe introduction to the game sets a fantastic tone for the entirety of the game. Many RPGMaker games I find can suffer from hideously slow beginnings that provide poor attempts at offering a tutorial at the costly expense of establishing a good story. The developers have found a way to provide both simultaneously. Beginners to RPGMaker games will be able to pick up the whys and the how to’s of the engine very easily while seasoned veterans will be able to immerse themselves into the game play very quickly making it an ideal game for both levels of gamers, a rare treat indeed.\n\nI’ve long been a fan of games that tackle real world issues head on in a way that is not overbearing or out welcoming but hammer home points that they want to make in a succinct and intelligent manner. The game handles the topics of science and pollution with aplomb. I was definitely skeptical at first as to how this would be tackled as the topic of pollution isn’t one that is very often covered in gaming. EternalShadow Studios weaves the important points that they want to make into the story line of the game in a thought provoking and succinct manner that pushes the strengths of the story without ever taking anything away from the game. I appreciate that as a rare feat of excellence.\n\nWhat a pleasant surprise to see a different graphical and artistic style than regular RPGMaker games. From time to time developers will attempt to offer some innovation to the artwork in games and to be different. There is a tremendous amount of risk associated with innovation in gaming and the result much of the time is an unfortunate one. However,  I really do enjoy the artwork in this game. It provides a different tone and level of ambiance than other games do.\n\nI want to take a moment to offer my appreciation for the early option to choose fantasy or modern character names and there are even examples provided of some of the main characters in the game. This was a very nice touch. Often times I find fantasy names to be grating. It was nice to have the choice to play as Blayze instead of Le’tainafae (the latter I made up).\n\nAt full price Beyond Reality sits at $4.99. Until the 16th of January the  game is $3.49. I argue that Aldorlea Games could easily have set a higher price for the game as I consider the game to be a quality purchase even at full price. At the sale price you’re laughing. If you’re in any way an RPG fan then there is much to like about Beyond Reality.\n\nFor more reviews similar to this one and our daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/","January 14","true","4.1"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

I played this game until the end, and I don't recall myself trying to grind because I can't defeat someone. This game comes from a game competition (Can't remember which...) and it was really short. This one is the extended version and is almost a completely different game compared to the previous version. Did it do any better? Yes, leaps and bounds better. I don't even remember this game as it used to be except for the graphics. There's more content and of course, more storyline in developing the characters. For such a price tage, I'd say yes, I'd recommend this game to anyone who wants a quick RPG that's worth your time. Took me 4 hours to complete this game (You can see my play record) and personally, I enjoyed my full 4 hours beating up everyone in the game. I'll give this a 9/10, because it's polished, fluid combat system, but it lacks a lot of other features. Sure, it has it's praises, but it has limited skills, yes, there are multiple characters, but I only stick with my favorites and that's pretty much it.","February 20","true","4.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

A bad dream with no relevance really, a girl in a crystal (where that came from I don't even  know), an S-Rank spell that transports you back in time and disingenuous reactions to that situation just made me go "uh..." - I mean, it just all seems so poorly fleshed out/cheesy. And why is the "most powerful mage in the world" far less powerful than your second recruited mage?\n- Dialogue needs some polishing.\nEXPANSION: It's not awful, don't get me wrong - but there's a lot of repetition and name-dropping which makes the dialogue rather boring at times. My advice to the dev is to implement some flavor text/exploration-based text throughout to strengthen the lore/situational awareness (like why Asha was in the crystal...that happened far too quickly).\n- Bugs. Mostly with passability (having to restart game because the guard won't move past you in Herador) - but I had a script error in battle that I wasn't able to replicate.\n- Boring battles\nEXPANSION: The "attack, get hit" repetition goes on far too long in most battles - maybe they get better as you progress and unlock new abilities?
