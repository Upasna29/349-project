The spell cards are fun to combine and the graphics for the time are pretty good. The character models aren't the best but I did like the backgrounds and lighting effects. What music is there is good although there's mainly over world and battle themes. Dungeons are generally silent. Sound effects are pretty good as well and satisfying to hear. The story isn't bad either. Sometimes you have to bring a certain character to an NPC to get them to say something specific or get a key item. Think about which character might be useful with a certain NPC or on what shell.  Your battle attack/spells have 3 levels of power leading to some strategy involved. Enemies can potentially be bypassed as in games like Earthbound and Chrono Trigger and there are no random battles, enemies are on screen almost always.\n\nTHE BAD: The dungeons get monotonous really fast, mainly because it's mostly about flipping switches to open doors that often lead to more switches. You're either opening doors or making new pathways and at the end you find a key item or fight a boss. Then you have to usually backtrack out of the dungeon manually which can get annoying if you just want to get out of there and don't care about exp and gold. An option to teleport out would have been helpful. There's also a lot of backtracking,  and clues to what needs to be done next can sometimes be confusing to figure out. Again, bringing the right character along on the right shell can be a big help in this aspect.\n\nAnother major glaring problem for me was the slow animations during battle and the sound effects  often took even longer, still playing even when the animations were done. This is especially a problem with the zombie enemies.  I found myself using machine gun characters when I could, just because their attacks are faster.\n\nCharacters take one turn at a time or combine turns during spells. You can't input commands usually until the character is done with their attack or spell/item usage unlike say a Final Fantasy game. This stuff is a bigger problem during the first half of the game, once you get a spell card that lets you attack all enemies it helps cut down on this some, but it's still a problem. I found myself running away from battles towards the end, just to get to the end of the game.\n\nOverall I enjoyed Septerra Core for the voice acting and story/setting. The battle system isn't BAD as an idea, and the card concept is neat, it's just feels slow as heck, at least for me. The switch flipping and backtracking got on my nerves fast. If the battle system was just faster, I might not have minded the rest, because that's mainly what made the dungeons more of a chore than anything else. If you're the patient type you might find the battles less grating than I did.\n\nI got it on sale here for a buck so it was worth the price. I'd give Septerra Core a 7/10. I'm going to overall recommend the game. Just be aware of the issues above if you decide to play.","October 19, 2014","true","46.5"," 69 of 78 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","69","78","0","0"

First off, if you get this game, get it from gog. The fix for many issues in the steam version is uninstall the Quicktime that Steam installs and to torrent the executable form a gog download. If you're going to need to get the file from gog in the first place, you might as well purchase it outright from there unless it's deeply discounted on Steam. If you do get from steam, be sure to uninstall the quicktime that was auto installed and install the version that is in the game folder as this will fix some of the issues.\n\nFirst off, anyone needs to realize that this game was originally released in 1999 so don't expect a mind blowing graphical experience. Also, the manual link on Steam doesn't populate anything so you'll need to go to the following link if you don't want to kludge around to see what works.\n\nhttp://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=20172&tab=controls\n\nCombat revolves around an ABT that has different sections that fill as time moves on during combat. Enemies appear to have the same ability but they usually seem to only utilize their weak/quick attack from what I've seen since starting the game. The voice acting is pretty decent when you consider the age of the title.\n\nAlright, now that we have all of that out of the way, we get down to the nitty gritty details of whether this game is worth your money and your time and the answer is No. If you're like me and have fond memories of playing this at a younger age, this will rip the blinds from your eyes and make you realize that not all games are worth the time invested in. The story is ok at best, the controls take a while to adjust to and never actually feel 'right' and the game doesn't give the option to remap them to where they feel more comfortable. If you enjoy jrpg's and can get past the technical issues, I would still recommend looking elsewhere as there is a decent collection of titles to choose from.","September 8, 2014","false","3.6"," 147 of 195 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","147","195","0","3"

While the bigger Final Fantasy games were tearing up the console world (7 and 8 were on PC as well) this forgotten gem appeared in my life through luck. I was browsing the local Hastings for an interesting PC game to play. I had around $30 to spend from my allowance, and I found Redneck Rampage for around $15. So I immediately grabbed it because it looked hilarious. Well, not wanting to leave with just one game, I kept browsing. It was then I seen a "Jewel" Pack. It contained within it two of the most influential games I would ever play, Shogo Mobile Armor Division, and Septerra Core, for $10. Feeling pretty satisfied, I got back home, and immediately put in Shogo, because who doesn't want to run around shooting things in a mech suit? After a few days of playing it, I booted up Redneck Rampage, and, as I expected, the game was hilarious and consumed me for another week or so. Finally, I installed Septerra Core. The case had no information, no screenshots, or any detail what-so-ever. I had no idea what I was getting into. But then, before my eyes, a gorgeous intro cutscene played, and then I was on the menu. Excited now, I hit New Game as fast as possible. The amazing voice acting, the wonderful rendered 2.5D graphics, the menu options, the character equipment, the stats, the magic system...Everything just hit me like a tidal wave. It was different, but that was a good thing. The story was just wonderful. The lack of a soundtrack made it better to me, because it made it more immersive. There are no soundtracks in real life, so why would a role-playing game need a continuous one? I can't recommend this title enough. To alot of modern gamers, this may seem like trash, but this is by far a superior to many of it's current companions. Enjoy your time in Septerra Core, I know I have.","January 19, 2015","true","3.3"," 49 of 54 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","49","54","2","2"

Here we are. FINALLY!\n\nI've started this game 4 times (thanks to a lot of PC crashes). The first time was back in the day, when this game was fairly new (sooo, around 2000/2001? maybe?). 15th of May 2015 I finally finished it. Did I like it as much as I did back when I was roughly 12 years old? Well... kinda.\n\nThe thing is: the game AGED ♥♥♥♥ING TERRIBLE!!!!!\n\nI don't know what my favorite feature is.\n\nMaybe the fact that everything is soooooooo slow. You're basically waiting for EVERYTHING. Wait for the fight to start. Wait until your action bar is filled up to the level you want. Wait for the enemy to finish attacking because it is their turn EVERY ♥♥♥♥ING TIME EXACTLY BEFORE YOUR ACTION BAR IS ALMOST FULL!!!! Wait for the attack animation to start! Wait for the attack animation to end! It takes ♥♥♥♥ing forever to get ♥♥♥♥ done in this game. And that's not talking about interacting with ♥♥♥♥ing objects. (Why Maya, why are you thinking so long about that order I just gave you? Pull the ♥♥♥♥ing lever!!!)\n\nOr maybe it is the TERRIBLE DUNGEON DESIGN that stretches the game about at least a third. Enter a ♥♥♥♥ING HUGE dungeon WHICH CONTAINS (apart from some items) NOTHING BUT LEVERS THAT OPEN DOORS AT THE OTHER END OF THE MAP. (Backtracking, Hooray!!!)\nAdd to that the fact that you visit a lot of dungeons AT LEAST TWICE. Multiple times if you by chance don't have a specific item or a specific party member.\n\nThat's right, most of the game is also a giant fetch quest of "use that item nobody told you about to progress". Get random item no.1 from place x to get random item no.2 that you might need 12 hours later at place y. Don't have item no.2 when you are IN THE ♥♥♥♥ING HUGE ♥♥♥ DUNGEON Y? WELL ♥♥♥♥ YOU, GO BACK TO X AND GET IT!!!! Thank god, that leaving one dungeon and entering a different one doesn't take ages...ohwait.\n\nI could probably continue, but I rather say that I really liked the world and the characters and back in 1999 all of these features/problems were probably not as much a pain in the ♥♥♥ as they are nowadays. The game even has some smart ideas like the 3-level-attack-bars and the spell casting system. Unfortunately, video games have moved on and kind of left Septerra Core behind. There are probably many other old games that have aged better.\n\nSo, do I recommend Septerra Core. Well, obviously I ♥♥♥♥ing do because it is a really charming game that always has a special place in my heart. Also, I am now officially done with it and never have to think back like: "Why did I never finish Septerra Core? That game was kickass back then!"\n\nIn my opinion, everyone should experience the sensation that is Septerra Core in its entirety. And if you didn't back then, well, sucks to be you because nowadays the game is horrible, tedious, physical pain.\n\nBut I still love you, Septerra Core. I do love you! <3<3<3<3<3","May 16, 2015","true","51.8"," 57 of 71 people (80%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","80","57","71","30","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jragghen/recommended/253940/","Jragghen","Jragghen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jragghen/","965 products in account","Septerra Core is....a difficult game to recommend. I should preface this review by saying that it is MOST CERTAINLY not for everyone. Septerra Core is an older turn-based RPG from a time where these sorts of games were common on consoles but rather rare on PC. I played the game to completion back in that era, and found it rather enjoyable - however, even then it had its rough edges, and for modern sensibilities it will be rather archaic.\n\nThe combat engine is location-based, similar to how Chrono Trigger is. However, the speed/pace everything works at is exclusively suited to when you have 3 members in your party, so combat is QUITE clunky in the early portion of the game, which makes it a bit of a hurdle to overcome.\n\nThe cast is varied, and the story was decent for the time (from what I recall - details are fuzzy). The concept of the WORLD itself is rather imaginative, and wholly unique from what I've run into in gaming. Aside from that, level design as the game progresses becomes....extremely maze-like. Lots of wrapping corridors which look same-y and form literal mazes.\n\nEffectively, I'm recommending this because I enjoyed this game when I played it. But anyone who purchases it should know what they're getting when they're going in - a game that was a little rough around the edges when it came out, and which probably won't appeal to most modern gamers. Only purchase if you really enjoy turn-based RPGs, or are interested in very imaginative sci-fi worlds.","March 2, 2014","true","4.6"," 38 of 44 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","38","44","0","0"

If you manage to survive the endless mazes that plague the second half, you can find an oldie gem under its dated exterior.\n\nLong version:Septerra Core: Legacy of the Creator is a strange beast: a PC-exclusive Western JRPG not made with RPG Maker; maybe the only one of this kind. It’s a JRPG to the core though with many tropes associated of the genre (like shops carrying better items because you are progressing in the story, not for any logical reason).\n\nDon’t expect a cheap Final Fantasy clone though– Monolith shook up the old NES JRPG elements and even added a few new ideas. For example, the battles use a modified ATB system where you can fill up three bars to unlock better abilities in combat– except for magic, which is cast by forming different card combinations.\nThe world left behind the old single-continent setup to feature a planet made out of seven rotating shell layers, each with their own themes. There is also a rich mythology, which also serves as the main plot element: your job is to stop an elitist madman before he destroys the world in pursuit of an old prophecy. And you accomplish that with an unusual cast: a female protagonist (who is not even a healer and doesn’t have a romantic sub-plot) accompanied by the strangest crew possible, ranging from a renegade cyborg to a sword-wielding knight or an armless smuggler.\n\nThe game’s weak spot is the level design: everything is a maze. It’s a small problem at first, since most of the locations are small and you can progress in a good pace. But after visiting all shells, the designers just gave up and forced the plot into a series of long labyrinths with boring switch puzzles. These easily take up two-thirds or more of the 50-60 hour play time, and probably scared away more people from this otherwise enjoyable game than they should have.","October 29, 2015","true","60.3"," 32 of 38 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","32","38","2","0"

It's a little bit dated now, but the gameplay/world is reminiscent of Chrono-Trigger and Final Fantasy, all with a heavy Sci-Fi/punkish leaning, even sharing a visual likeness with Fallout 2, but much easier on the eyes. The story line is paced especially well, and is done in short snippets so you're not constantly bombarded with text (but there are books of lore if you want to know more).\nThere's also extra side-stuff to explore, as to reach those special areas and get good loot you'll have to pay attention to your surroundings and use your brain. I wish more RPGs did this these days, honestly, it's quickly become one of my favourites! The only thing to be cautious of are the compatibility issues, which can be worked around...\n\nFIXING THE DAMN GAME (at least for Windows)\n1) Go here and follow the patching instructions, takes a couple of mins tops.\n\nNow, chances are, the cinematics aren't going to work after that, you'll probably just see nothing but a white screen. I took the trouble of finding the cinematics on YouTube, ripping them and re-encoding them so....\n\n2) ...go to my google drive here  download the zip and replace the cinematics in your Septerra Core folder. Should work for everyone and hopefully save you a lot of headache! Obviously I'm not responsible for your computer blowing up or anything like that.\n\n3) Lastly, you will probably find that after your first battle, the game appears to freeze. It's actually not locked-up, just a really annoying bug. The solution should be to hold a specific button down on your keyboard. For me it's the Print Screen button, but others report that holding ctrl+a works for them. The camera will move to focus on your players, then you'll get the post battle XP-gain info, etc and you're good to go. Some players report that changing their vsync settings on their graphics card to On or Off fixes the bug all together, but I've had no luck doing that (Nvidia 760, Windows 7).\n\nThat's it! Enjoy!\n\nExtra) I'd recommend saving your ears by turning down the Sound FX to about 3/4 of max and Voice to about 4/5ths of max. Leave the music at max, then change the master volume to suit. Annoyingly, you'll have to do this every time you open the game, but it only takes a second anyway.","June 14, 2015","true","19.8"," 24 of 25 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","24","25","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pokemaztre/recommended/253940/","pokemaztre","pokemaztre","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pokemaztre/","104 products in account","Septerra Core is a JPRG style PC game which developed by, surprisingly, an USA based company Valkyrie Studios. The style itself isn't very popular in PC environment, because of almost all JRPG only released in console at that time, so the introduction of SC becomes a quick attention to PC gamers, especially JRPG enthusiasts. The game itself is very special for me, because I played the demo version (which I got from computer magazine CD) with my friend in a very early age. Despite didn't understand the story, we had a very good time :)\n\nThe main plot is cliche, it's not far from an usual heroine act, "to save the world," again! But I can guarantee that the environment, the world idea, the legend and tale which made the whole stories, is way amazing. In Wind City, there's a library which has many many books tell the story in a very long written about Septerra: what is the core, the prophecy, conflict between shells, the war of gods, the creator, and all the history about the SC world, you gotta read them. You really need to sap the stories, because it will helps you to maintain the motivation to survive the boredom which becomes the true challenge of this game :P\n\nThe combat system is very very SLOW. The character's attacking animation basically consists of: She/he needs to jump, in a very funny way, to get close to the enemy - doing an attack - and jump again into his/her place. It will take around 8-10 seconds! Even more bad news if the char using projectile, especially laser weapon which sounds "humm..", because we need to wait that SFX finish (add another 5 seconds) before the char moves into the next frame.\n\nThis game really teaches you how to become patient o_O!\n\nDespite of that issue, the battle is really balanced but sometimes can be challenging, especially when encounter a special skilled enemy, mini boss, not to mention the secret boss (They are scattered everywhere!). You need to prepare the selection of party members, equipments, healing items, and of course magic power. Magic in SC world is very interesting, the char need to collects some kind of "Fate Cards" - with a very unique Godly characteristic in each of them. The card can be used by utilized the core power, individually or combined. The combined effect is depend on what cards being used: from attack, defense barrier, healing aura, elemental attack, super mega god bringer power attack, the possibility is almost endless.\n\nWell, after all this is a 1999-released game, the first game released by a new developer, and unfortunately was the last game as well (Valkyrie Studios went bankrupt when developing its second game), so despite many cons, especially in combat system, but still, with a not really bad visual, awesome voice over, interesting magic system, and a very amazing storyline, the game is still worth to buy, especially if you had played this game before.","November 16, 2014","true","10.0"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","4"

With a wide array of characters to include in your party and distinct dialogue options for each one, there is a lot of opportunity to learn more about the world and hear the perspectives of your party members. Some parts can be challenging if you aren't sure where to go or how to find a quest item you need but exploration is rewarded.

Septerra.ini contains all the keyboard settings, now you can configure it how you like. RunSelect is to run away from battle.\n2. In the Septerra.ini under options add ScaleMode = 0 and CpuIdle = 5\n3. Get this patch from http://www.patches-scrolls.de/patch/3624/30575\n4. Uninstall QuickTime and use the QuickTime installer withiin the Septerra folder.\n5. Set the new Septerra.exe from step 3 to compatibility mode for Win XP SP3\n6. Do not use Timeslips unofficial patch, it converts the .db movies into white screens with audio.\n\nBy following these steps you won't need to do the following fixes:\n\n1. Resolution color depth changes from 32 bt to 16 bit.\n2. Disabling any graphical settings through properites of the .exe\n3. No need to try and configure to run in a window to enjoy its graphics.\n\nThe game will keep its aspect ratio and play in full screen.

Gameplay-wise, you know little of what to do unless some characters explicitly specify you where to go, but fortunately the areas aren't as extensive and misleading as FF's are, so catching up to where you left at will be relatively easy.\n\nCombat goes as follows: you can have up to 3 characters at any one time following you, each with different stats, play-style, and skills. When you're in combat, there is a bar under each of your characters that fills up as time goes on, with 2 3-digits numbers that represent your HP. The bar is divided into 3 parts; simply put, if you let it fill in one part, you can only use the basic weapons/moves which deals less damage, but if you let it fill up entirely, you can use more damaging moves (and the same goes for using cards, this game's equivalent of magic). You click on a character's frame when at least one bar is filled up, select the move you want to use (or use items, or invoke card powers), and target the enemy. There is a big bar of blue on top of the combat interface; that's your core energy, or what you'd call Mana, MP, SP, or whatever. NOTHING in combat regenerates, even post-battle (unless you manually use items or rest to recover those combat stats), so keep in mind when you do anything mid battle. The game is generous enough to tell you that when you use a certain move or card, the energy bar shows how much energy that move/card is going to use up, so you can plan your moves carefully. Overall, the combat feels balanced; challenging if you rush through the game with zero grinding, and rewarding if you decide to grind in one area.\n\nHowever, the game does not tell you what any of your character's stats do, so you pretty much have to experiment with each, or deduce yourself what each does. Also, despite the game telling you where to go next explicitly through well-voiced NPC dialogues, it does not tell you what to do when you're in said location.\n\nThe plot is quite linear, with little, but appreciable amount of side-missions. The lore is, personally, rather extensive for a game that has no sequel. You go from place A to place B, go to C, then back to A for some quick stuffs, and move on to D.\n\nLaziness overtook me. I'll just say that if you're someone who enjoys FF or JRPG in general, puzzles, and exploring, this game is worth the price.\n\nP.S. get the official patch for this game, otherwise it's unplayable for Windows 7 and above. I wouldn't recommend installing the unofficial patch because it made the game run on like, 2 or 3 fps.","July 10, 2014","true","12.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Full voice acting and impressive graphics for 1999 combine with an exciting story and interesting character development to make a memorable experience. Fans of the early Final Fantasy games should truly enjoy this game.\n\nIts biggest flaw is that the combat system can become boring or even tedious after a while. I also found it frustrating that enemy health bars are hidden by default. If either of those bother you too much, there are cheat codes (true to any 90s game) to fix both of those problems.\n\nDisclaimer: I played the disk version of this game, and purchased the Steam version because I lost the disk. I've heard rumors of bugs in the Steam version, but I emailed Topware support and they said that they were working to resolve them.

Very similar turn based battles with combination attacks. Just like in CT, there's a robot character, girl engineer character, etc. But crappy plot/dialogue and insane amount of mind numbing, time consuming backtracking. I attempted to play this game several times, wasted tens of hours, never finished it, deleted after one or another boring fetch quest. And plot.. I can't remember much after all these years, but it involved some evil dude hunting for some macguffin and several characters dying while trying to give my character time to escape. Yes, this dumb cliche scene occured 2 or 3 times through the game.\nPre-rendered 2D graphics in 640x480 sure looked nice in 90s, but were already dated at the time of release. Its main competitor, Anachronox, also a CT-inspired western JRPG, looks much better on modern PCs, in addition to simply being better written and more fun. Also suffers from backtracking, but has "secret" fast-forward button to make it bearable.\nAnd this game.. I would not call it bad, but it isn't Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy, Xenogears, Fallout, Baldurs Gate, Planescape Torment, Dark Sun, etc. etc. So many great games, so little time.

Nowadays i cant stomach jrpg style round based combat anymore but to my surprise sunk quite some hours into this already because it puts a good spin on the formula.\n\nTheres the typical ATB system but its kinda like charging up instead of waiting for the bar to fully fill to being able to do something. Theres 3 levels - If you just wanna pop a potion or do a quick weak attack you can do that at the first level which is full usually in like 3 seconds. Second level delivers more oomph and third level delivers major oomph (double and triple with damage bonus else what would be the point of waiting) and all levels also have special attacks available. At the start when theres not many options its still unfortunately a snorefest but when you get more dudes with differing attack strength and charge speed it gets interesting, moreso since its all realtime (it stops when you click your dudes to select actions tho).\n\nAlso no random battles, you can see all enemies on the map.\n\nGraphic style and character design is interesting/weird, like FF7 and Baldurs Gate mashed together - i guess western rpgs needed more anime hair. Simple and sensible story by comparision. Some tedium like multiple treks thru the same frikking cave but thats the nature of the beast prolly.\n\nSurpassed my expectations by a long shot.","October 5, 2013","true","0.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

Whether it's worth it is up to you.\n\nSo this is a complete nostalgia purchase for me. I played the original, liked it, wanted to play it again and here we are.\n\nI personally would recommend this game, but know that it is very dated. It comes from an era where games were much simpler and got away with bugs they probably shouldn't have. I have had a bug encounter on my gameplay, but only one and it wasn't game breaking, so not that bad.\n\nBy today's standards, this game falls short on just about everything except story. The highlight of the game is the over-reaching plot that you discover as you explore and complete the game. Everything else, like the graphics, music, etc are going to fall short by a very good measure.\n\nSo is this game worth it for you? I can't answer that. I can say that this is a turn-based JRPG with a good story, but not a whole lot else. Where it offers an interesting combat system that isn't the typical standard, by today's standards it would fall flat.\n\nBased on when the game came out, I'd rate this a solid 7/10.\nBy today's standards I'd rate this a 3/10.\nPut them together and you get a 10/10 game... lol jk...\n\nBut seriously though, if you like old JRPGs and you feel like porting yourself back to the 20th century, then you'll have a good experience. Play it like it's the 21st century and you'll be bored unless you're a huge story person.","June 25, 2015","true","4.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

I have it on my wish list but thanks to the surprisingly huge amount of classic games on my playlist i kinda forget about this game. Until a few weeks ago i saw it on Steam's weekly sales only for 8 cents, i bought it without thinking twice.\n\nAfter playing for about 3 hours i REGRET my purchase.\n\nThe premise and the lore is interesting but the combat is too slow and so boring.\nIt's using ATB gauge similar to FFXIII with weaker moves can be used with one "stock" of ATB and stronger moves needs more. Sadly with the animations painfully stiffs and so slow(and useless espescially the summoning animation (Totally pointless.) this makes battle really tedious.\n\nEnemies are too fast and too strong or maybe it's the characters that is actually too weak.  Magic is utterly useless.\nEnemies also appeared on the map, this giving you an illusion of freedom whether to fight them or simply leave them alone.\nBut unfortunately as i played the game it is became apparent that the developer is intending for most of them to be mandatory what with enemies placed in the middle of a small maps making them virtually impossible to ignore.\n\nThe dungeons aren't too big but enemies are everywhere making the game feels bloated.\nPuzzles are uninteresting because it's mainly "switch puzzles."\nYou know press the switch this door open and that door closed.\nEnemies also respawn whenever you leave a map, making backtracking very painful.\n\nAnd since this game is a mix of RPG and point n click genre you will be pixel hunting most of the time.\nUnfortunately some key items and unique items can be missable thanks to this feature.\nI really recommend you to play the game with a walkthrough to reduce this possibility because a simple backtracking can cost you a good chunk of time.\n\nI realized that these problems also exist on most of the games i've played but this time it feels so apparent that the game is so badly made.\nMaybe because i've been playing modern RPGs on my 3ds lately that i've been unconsciously comparing it with some of them.\nWith these thoughts inside my head i grind my teeth and keep playing the game.\n\nAnd without my realization i've already playing for more than 40 hours.\nYep i'm hooked up with this game that i once thought to be pretty bad.\n\nFor your information this game is progressively getting better as the stories unfold.\nDialogue and story becomes more interesting, new characters with unique backgrounds and combat style (there is a character that looks like Xenomorph.)\n\nMagic becomes more and more prevalent and when you got the attack all card you will be unstoppable in random battles making the game less tedious.\nAnd the mix of point n click genre actually makes the game more interesting and near the middle of the game you are free to go wherever you want to gather clues and doing quests, giving an illusion of freedom.\n\nI like that.\n\nOverall this is a solid game with good voice acts(i got a boner hearing Maya's voice :v ) but the music is a bit\nunderwhelming and boring.\nGameplay is pretty solid but marred with slow paced battles. Graphics is well what you can expect from 1999 game.\n\nOh yeah the overall vibe of the game kinda reminds me of Final Fantasy 7, you know a mix of technology, swords and sorcery but in a less grandiose scale.\nThe reason i thought the game was pretty bad at first is because i didn't have the right mindset when i played.\nI'm inevitably comparing this game to recently released RPGs. Of course it won't hold.\nIf you are looking for classic rpg and you know what you are getting into i really recommend this game.\n\nI give this game a score of  7/10\nWith Final Fantasy 7 an 8/10 :v\n\nPS: Play your favorite songs on Steam's music player (Seriously who the hell used that?), read a book or playing Adventure Capitalist while playing this game. It helps to stave off the boredom.","October 22, 2015","true","58.7"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","2"

I never played any of those angled top down point and click games like Diablo, so I won't say I'm familiar with those kind of games. But I love an RPG, especially if it promises to be a great experience!\nI got this game for $0.64, a good price, especially if you use money you earned by selling cards on the Steam Community Market.\nThe games started out fine, but then I realized that it was missing cutscenes.\nDon't worry, I fixed it within the hour using these steps: just follow the "How to get Septerra Core working fully guide" in the Steam Community, then uninstall the current quicktime program, install the version of quicktime in the Septerra steam folder, set the compatitbility mode of the program to Windows XP (SP2), and open up QuickTime, go to Preferences > QuickTime Preferences > Advanced > Uncheck the three DirectX check boxes. Done!\nSo, back to the actual game\nThe graphics look outdated, but for being a game of its time, I can overlook it. The plot is engaging, I like the setting, and the combat, while slow, might speed up later in the game. If you can get this game for a good price and get it to work, I would totally recommend this!","March 14","true","7.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I was genuinely interested in seeing more of the unique seven-layer world of Septerra Core, and frequently read the ample flavor text provided in the form of library books and other such things.  With this saving grace in mind I pushed on bravely, hoping that at some point new skills and features might make combat less of a pain to sit through, but sadly it was not to be.\n\nDon't put yourself through this the way I did.

First off, you will NEED a walkthrough. The game does give you precisely zero direction on where your objectives actually are. Second, combat is a CHORE. I find myself dumping as many bonuses as I can into my speed stats just so I can get through it quicker. To be clear, an attack is carried out usually by a combatant jumping toward their attack target, performing their attack animation, then jumping back into their position. This whole time, the entire ATB system stops so you can watch. Combat is structured much like Final Fantasy 13's combat, except far less fluid. You get three action bars, but only one action a turn, and any action you take drains your entire ATB meter. I learned this the hard way. The one thing it does have going for it is that its story is keeping me interested (I do enjoy a good story well told), but combat is going to have to start getting much quicker.\n\n------\n\nThis game is fine but not perfect. I picked it up on sale for a whopping 75 cents and at that price, sure, worth every penny. But then, so are most games.\n\nI've been playing it for a little while, but it gives you no instruction on how to play it at all. Opening cutscenes finish and you're just standing there like a dunce.\n\nThe game is controlled by click-and-holding where you want to go (you can use arrow keys, but...just use the mouse), and your first objective is to get to class.\n\nThis is me, right now, on that first objective: http://youtu.be/7hR34OGe30I?t=2m14s\n\nAt 75 cents, it's a steal.

To my understanding, it's a pretty old game so it is possible to be understanding towards it. However, many parts of this game are simply too frustrating and confusing to make it enjoyable. It only has nostalgia value for those who have played it before. If this game ever gets a remake and its problems are fixed, then I might give it a try again.\n\n+ Fairly interesting characters\n+ Battle music is pretty neat\n+ Funny robots\n\n+/- Story; Nothing really worth mentioning.\n\n- HORRID combat pace; You have to watch the characters jump through air, hit the target and then jump back. Half the combat is watching is horrendously long animation. I like the main heroine because she just shoots the enemies.\n- Very bleak; There's no colour anywhere. Every world is just depressing and gloom. It makes you think you're looking at a post-apocalyptic world when in reality it's not.\n- Pretty quiet; The game doesn't play music often enough.\n- Confusing story-telling; The story skips many parts that are required for us to form a complete picture of the story. Having cutscenes would help but they're not there.\n- Frustrating puzzles; True to the games of old, many of the puzzles are VERY obscure. I needed a walkthrough on many occasions to make any sense of what must be done.\n\nIf you still insist on giving this game a try, wait until it's on sale.","April 14, 2015","false","10.6"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

No, it's not. It's soulless and cheesy, along with the entire script itself.\n\nWhen I played this game as a kid I liked it very much. As of now, I understand why it never made big. That's because it sucks. The main character is unlikable and unappealing. Actually, no character is likable in this game other than the robot dog Runner. Also, I find a lot of things very cheesy in the game, one example being Led's father's bad decision. What you expect to happen is him listening to his daughter. When he refuses and leaves, he also puts men on the bridge to stop anyone from coming, including his daughter. I laughed when I saw this fight; a general is ready to nuke an entire continent to protect his daughter from harm and he'll stop at nothing, he'll even let his men throw grenades at her if she tries to stop him.\n\nWhat a joke.

The reviews out there are right.  The battles, which is a HUGE chunk of any JRPG-style game, needs to be solid.  The biggest problem is that it's so slow.  Painfully slow to the point you will start to dread each encounter.  In short, you have to wait, and wait for your attack gauge to fill up for a more powerful attack.  Meanwhile, you're being hit repeatedly by the enemy, in very slow and poor animations.  When you attack, you miss often, and also have a slow and poor animation.  By the time I had fought a dozen battles, I didn't want to deal with them anymore.\n\nI could go on about some of the redeeming qualities I noticed, such as the solid music, some witty dialogue, and the overall premise of the game, but it's all completely crippled by the battle system.  You might want to see what happens next, but I struggled to push through the awful fighting and get there.\n\nTo note, I'm 30 yrs old and have been playing RPG's since the original Dragon Warrior and Final Fantasy.  I love those games.  I do not love this game.

The only problem with the game is the technical issues try to make the cutscenes, text from not skipping, etc (unless you've figured it out from the message boards) & if you're into turnbased battles then this is a game for you","November 30, 2015","true","25.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have reached Shell 7 for the first time.  I like the combat mechanics, having to choose how to attack and with how much power.  I am still learning how to combine magical attacks to maximize the damage, but it seems to follow a pattern that makes sense.\n\nPros\nlikeable party members.  Each has a background, although, not always compatable with every other party member.\nThe combat system rewards paying attention to the situation and previous encounters with the same or similiar enemies.\nLogical puzzles, there have not been any combine the wax candle with the brandy and ice cream to open the locked door.\n\nCons\nNone that are not related to the release date.  Even then, the graphics are better than many of the new indie games being released on Steam today.\n\nGive this game a chance and embrace the combat system.","November 21, 2015","true","61.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

He said that it was really fun and since he's such a big fan of RPGs, I've taken his word for granted. A few months later I've seen it for sale and decided to give it a try. Well, to be quite honest I wasn't so thrilled with it so I've put it aside and didn't touched it again, that until Steam reminded me of its existence. After all those years I just felt like giving it another shot (especially because the price was alright). To be quite honest, it wasn't such a bad experience... Well, actually it doesn't offer much replay value, because there're some really tedious mazes and a whole lot of grinding, so I just feel like taking an instant nap when I think of it. Besides that, if you don't have a FAQ to provide you some support during your run, things can get even more annoying. The story isn't bad, the characters are somewhat generic, the gameplay is ok, the soundtrack is fine too, but nothing memorable anyway. I won't say anything about the graphics because after all, we're talking about an outdated game. Although I'm recommending it here, my thoughts about Septerra Core are kinda mixed, so I'd only advise hardcore JRPG fans to try it and even so they might simply feel disappointed.","September 22, 2015","true","51.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Worth working through the glitches and bugs.  Just don't pay more than $5 or else you will feel like an idiot.\n\nReally the only good thing about this game is the story, which will keep you wondering what really is going on for a good while.  If you are looking for an old RPG that is nothing like the Final Fantasy series but has a unique charm, then get this one.  Just be aware that there are a few tricks you will need to set it up to run properly before you can play.  And during the game you will need a bit of patience to iron out or avoid a couple of nasty glitches.\n\nThe music is terrible and choppy, and often just decides to quit altogether.  The voice recordings are not particularly good, either.  Conversation with NPCs and party members is done by static head images with dialogue windows.  Battle is turn-based with a timer for each player; a level 2 action means a longer wait than a level 1 action.  Sometimes you will have to grind for XP and money before you can make any significant progress.  And you will never be sure where you are supposed to go next, so maybe have a good walthrough guide handy while you play.","March 16","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love the game because of its storyline. It is about a world with seven rotating shells. In the middle of all these shells is the Core, which contains a hidden power. Each shell resides different types of people. The furthest shell from the Core belongs to the Chosen Ones. One of the Chosen General has decided to harness the power of the Core for his own. You are Maya. Together with your companions, you will try to stop the General and bring balance to all seven shells.\n\nBattle is somewhat turn-based with a twist. You can activate which power level for your characters. Maya can choose any two companions before entering a battle, somewhat similar to other Japanese-type games. The game duration is surprisingly quite long for an old game.\n\n100% satisfaction.\n\n\n\n","December 26, 2015","true","38.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
