Do you like Firefly or Mad Max? Does the post disaster/apocalyptic setting appeal? Do you like melancholy, moody music? Do you tend to like more serious  'grown up' games that allow true role playing? Are you happy to wander around on your own, sometimes for long stretches of time, without seeing a soul? Are you more of a loner (a strange question for an MMO perhaps)? Are you more of a calm person who takes gaming slowly rather than rushing to experience a game in the shortest possible time? If the answer is mostly yes this game could be for you...\n\nFor me, the atmosphere in this game is second to none. Fantastic music, incredible view distance that really hammers home the immense size of the game (around 1000 square kilometres I believe - to put that into perspective Skyrim is around 40 I think) and true freedom to go pretty much wherever you want right from the very start of the game. Note though that I play as a single player - I'm not a clan type of person - so I can't really tell you much about the social side of the game. It is fairly quiet of late - not too many players - but that suits me fine.\n\nIt's certainly not a polished experience but then, if you're anything like me, that won't matter in the slightest. There's plenty of minor bugs although hardly any will stop progress (a simple relog usually sorts out most things) and there are plenty of minor gameplay things to moan about but, overall, the game is very unique and well worth the download. A huge thing in its favour is that it's a true free to play game. You can play the entire game without spending any real world money. Real world money will get you cool items to wear, cool vehicles, nice buffs and such but almost all of it can also be purchased with in game earned currency if you are patient and keep an eye on the auction house for bargains. It's also worth noting that a lot of the coolest, unique weapons and clothing items can only be earned through questing.\n\nI'm not going to go too heavily into the mechanics of the game - it's pretty standard MMO levelling and crafting (but a very deep and rewarding crafting system) and such but it is one of the very few MMO's with real time skill based combat - think first person shooter - and the whole experience of the game is very 'manual' - nothing's on auto pilot - it's all on you to use your skill to stay alive basically.\n\nRight, I think I've talked enough now...","March 2, 2015","true","295.4"," 471 of 497 people (95%) found this review helpful 40 people found this review funny","95","471","497","40","11"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cauboidoespaco/recommended/113420/","cauboidoespaco","Space Cowboy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cauboidoespaco/","231 products in account","IMHO, this is one of the best and underrated MMOs I've player on my entire gaming life (20 years of gaming so far).\nWhy, you might ask me? I'll tell ya.\n\nSTORY:\nThe background story is amazing and it mixes Fallout series, Mad Max movies and also A Boy and His Dog references (if you ever saw this movie, you, sir, consider yourself lucky). The game has an unique atmosphere aswell. Not only a futurist set, but a post-apocalyptic one, finely made.\n\nMAP:\nThe map is HUGE, I mean, HUGE (already tell ya that ♥♥♥♥ is huge?!). You could spent like 8-10 hours to cross the sectors on foot, if you make it alive.\n\nCRAFTING:\nForget everything else about other's game crafting. This is THE ♥♥♥♥.\n\nYou can craft your own vehicles or train your own animals! Ride a mutant chicken or a horse (you can have many, many different kind of horses) or go in a bad ♥♥♥ mode on a bike.\nYou can craft almost everything, even tents, campsites and stuff like that to get temporary area buffs.\nCraft armors, firearms, melee weapon, explosives, medicine, steroids, recipes, foods, drinks, mutagenics... the list is so big that probably I'd spend all the reviews talking about it.\n\nAlso, you need to craft ammunition for your weapons and gas, diesel or biodiesel for your vehicles, besides ration for your animals and repair kits for heal equipment damage from fights.\n\nAfter all, even if it bothers some people, I must say that I LOVE the time required to crafting. Everything you make by crafting need proper time to get done, from just a few secs to hours or even weeks. A single tire for a car requires 8-12 hours.\n\nCOMBAT:\nIt's a partial FPS where you need to land your blows and aim to shot manually. No auto-target, which is great for PvP. Headshots cause a lot of extra fatal damage, rewarding you for your skill player.\n\nThe game have a lot of customization, meaning your character can max various skills to fulfill different roles on a party or even solo. You could be a mutant DPS or a healer, a gunslinger, a rifleman, sniper, fight with a big axe, two tires, be a sneaking rogue, a buffer/debuffer leader or pretty much anything.\n\nPVP:\nAwesome.\nThe game is partial-PvP. I mean, it's not a full PvP map, but, instead, we have PvP zones. On these zones, players need to fight over rare resources like petroleum! People can build settlements and siege-like stuff aswell.\n\nThe game has 6 factions which the player can join. Each one has it's owns charateristics, RP-related and PvP gear. These factions are at war/alliance relationships with each other.\n\nThe game also have a lot of player's guilds and alliances and people Pvping over resource nodes and PvP zones.\n\nMORE PROS (MORE AWESOME IN YOUR AWESOMENESS):\n- Not just more of the same. It really brings something NEW and FRESH to MMO players looking for something special.\n- F2P (doesn't matter to me, but it's nice to try for free if you're not sure about it).\n- Buy, craft and dye clothes and use them over your regular armor on cosmetic slots. You can even paint and customize your car, bike, etc.\n- Active, nice and helpful GMs; 24/7 on chat.\n- A LOT OF DANCE MOVES, including MJ and the awesome Carlton Banks dance (Alfonso to his close friends).\n- A LOT of creative skills that you don't see everyday.\n- Welcoming and active community (don't let the Steam numbers fool you, cause the most people playing it are using the non-Steam client).\n- Deep and beautiful scenarios.\n- Scary voiceover (turn it off, man).\n- You have a flashlight.\n- Immersion feel on every step you take.\n- Level up takes a long long time, giving you some sense of importance in the world.\n- Awesome PvP.\n- You can fight while riding or driving! Man, EVERY SINGLE MMO should have this. Drive fast while unloading a submachinegun clip on a pursuit, why not? Not a Fast & Furious type? You can do the cowboy Texas style aswell and shoot you Colt Anaconda on the horseback.\n- You can have a dog! (anyone remember Dogmeat from Fallout 2?)\n- Different paces of walking/driving/riding. You can walk, jog or run and drive/ride at speed as you like. Not so fast, no so slow, the way you want.\n\nCONS:\n- One thing I dislike in this game is it's name. Should be called Awesome Earth.\n- Performance issues on some PCs.\n- "Dated" graphics (I've player UO for 11 years, ask me if I give a dame for graphics?!)\n- "Hardcore", even not having a full loot system like Darkfall, Ultima Online and Mortal Online (love them all). What makes this game "hardcore" for some users is the fact that you need build and plan your character very carefully or it could be useless or disapointing at some point.\n- Unfriendly interface and learning curve.","June 23, 2014","true","821.2"," 799 of 892 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","799","892","0","22"

Not fabricate what already exists and slap a “done” sticker on the front. I want something new, with a quirk or unique feature, not a copy paste.\n\n3)	There is very little explanation about how skills, items and game mechanics work, only basic key mapping like moving, turning and combat.\n4)	The story is fairly mild at best\n5)	Melee combat is dull\n6)	Quests have a tendency to “bug out” or have confusing objectives, one situation was where I needed to go to a point on the map, let an NPC follow me and walk back to the start point. Apart from I failed the quest somehow on the first try, the game never explained how or why.\n\nWhen I went back there the NPC that was meant to follow me no longer appears, and as such I have no idea how to complete the quest.\nOther situations like questing disappearing from my menu also happen frequently, meaning quests I was halfway through needed to be picked up again from a guy quite literally 3 miles away and completed in one go.\n\n7)	Menus are very clunky, from the start I was bombarded by a bunch of skills I didn’t know (and still don’t know) the effects or uses of.\n8)	The crafting system does nothing new, by which I mean it's all dull bashing objects togeather to make something out of thin air.\nIt's also crafted in real time, which can sometimes be up to half an hour for some items. Maybe more.\n9)	How skills work is never explained, you have to figure it out via tooltips.\n10)	For me this game took over 50 minutes to download, unpack and patch before I could play.\n11)	I have no idea how they got the screenshots on the store page, I push everything to max and it still looks like something a commodore 64 would play.\n\nSo what is good about it?Well for a start it is actually very well made. The skills menu and the depth of control you have is refreshing. You don’t get your hand held and from the start you can wander in any direction you please.\nSpeaking of wandering, the map is a very good and from my current playtime I could guess that if you wanted to skirt the edge like a racetrack it would take you several hours to do so on horseback or via a vehicle, it has many interesting points and few “blank” spots. Yet the map still does not feel crowded...\n\nIf you are a nerd like me you will probably understand the skills system quickly, it’s very D&D style with character sheets and raising skills that all affect your other skills. The mechanics are probably what holds this game up.\nDialogue feels forced but it’s fairly frequent, not every line is voiced but there are greetings you get from time to time. What makes it better is the lack of hand holding and the freedom you are given.\n\nI know I have scorned games that have committed fewer crimes than this one, but I honestly see it getting better later on. I’ll probably keep playing for another 30 hours, I doubt much more than that.\nIt’s kept me busy for almost 10 hours, it’s very consuming once you get immersed.\n\nIf I had to give a score it would probably be a very high "meh, eye candy. Made me forget I was starving for a few hours"\nIt has lots of bad points but for me mechanics outweigh graphics, voice acting and story","October 28, 2014","true","9.1"," 1,354 of 1,546 people (88%) found this review helpful 124 people found this review funny","88","354","1","124","32"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HackerDemonsWorld/recommended/113420/","HackerDemonsWorld","RealChris","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HackerDemonsWorld/","53 products in account","If you like Fallout and STALKER, then this game is for you, this game is mostly based in gameplay not graphical, but still has STALKER graphics, decent, it has First person, 3rd Person. Its similiar to Fallout, find missions, Find weapons and armor, but this game has a pretty dynamic view of recipe creations, incredible Gamemasters, which help prevent spammers from annoying you or harrassing you In-game. Although help is limited unless you buy at least one Store item, which isnt a bad thing, Its Free2Play why complain, if you plan on keep playing than buy something from the Marketplace to unlock You're Certain limits In-game. When creating Recipes, some take minutes while some take hours to days. So this game isnt for the faint of heart, if you can't read and follow through quickly and comprehend well, then this game is not for you.\n\nCertain Armor and Gear, are only available through PVP, which is recommended with Teams. This game has well endored people playing so its best to keep you're Manners at hand, you tick one person off and you're name is pretty much Kill on sight, game is comprehensive when it comes to recipes, FE is hard to play through without recipes, but isnt impossible since it has a similiar concept as Amazon sellers or Ebay Auctions, since this game has its Own Auction House, mail box which you can send and recieve mail just as real life with packaging.\n\nIf you follow through the beginning Tutorial you will recieve free gear and a Vehicle. Easiest ways to make Chips as in cash, is to collect and farm and Auction off items, but keep an amount of items for yourself.\nThe game is quite simple when it comes to making a clan or joining a clan, you also get a Help channel with Region and local, But Global Chats are unlocked with a single item bought from the Marketplace.\n\nThe Devs, do their best at updating but at times can be slow, just like most any other games, the current level from this review is lvl55, since they take their sweet time when updating higher lvls.\n\nIf you plan on playing this game keep in mind, DON'T rush the game, take you're time, customize you're controls, set you're Window Panels in-game best to you're level. Don't forget you get basic Training abilities with Mutations that disapear at a certain level. Max chip limits are all 9 chips in every chip collor for now. Don't Skip levels, if you play all missions you'll have more than enough chips to buy whatever suits you. I dont recommend Power-Leveling unless you already played all the missions on another Alternative Character AKA Alt. Its best to stay within the lines of all Factions until you know which Faction is best for you.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nUpdate 1/13/14\n\nAuction House: Used to sell whatever Items that are tradable, though most people I have noticed that are new to this game even older members tend to get two things confused at times, first.\nRemember that theres differences between Not Tradable and Not sellable. Not tradable means exactly what it means, you can't trade it with other members of the game like yourself, and Cannot be sold, means you can't sell that item to the Merchants in-game. This doesnt mean you can't place this in the AH unless it states its both Not Tradable and can't be sold. If it just says cant be sold, you can trade the item with players but cant sell it to the merchants. if the item says it cant be traded but doesnt say it cant be sold, that means you cant trade with Players but you can sell it to Mercs. If both are displayed, best th8ing to do is either two things, stash it somewhere or right click the item to delete or Scrap it for parts, if given that Option.\n\nMost players have a hard time figuring out where best to scavenge loot, whether its for crafting or selling. Try looking in the outskirts of Embry, Oilvile, Pass Chris and other towns, Oilvile contains alot of Copper and Lead deposits for example.\n\nWaypoints.\nWaypoints is VERY important in this game if you have a hard time keeping track of where your favorite spots are, rather its for looting and killing. To use Waypoints go to your Menu and locate the name Waypoints click it to open another window you can create a Waypoint or Add another. To create your own you can locate your Radar and click the globe icon to bring up your strategic map, from there, you can uncheckmark the Overhead to view detailed Information of where your at, and you can right click where ur Marker is at to add a waypoint, you can edit name to easily find it in your Waypoints Manager Window.\n\nCopy recipe Links or AH links to Chat Windows\n\nIf you are near a AH or chatting in a Chat Bar, you can link recipes by going to Menu locating your Recipes and find the desired recipe and look at the bottom of your recipe, you will see an icon that looks like Shuffled cards, next to that icon is a chat bubble you click that to add it to any Recently Active Chat windows, then Enter it to show Full recipe to someone, But NEVER shout out recipes in the HELP section, since this will get you muted or possibly banned from Help for Spamming in the Help channel. Just like Adding Recipes you can also just directly link the Item itself rather the full recipe which is useful in the Auction Channel so you dont spam and make anyone mad. To do so, locate any recipe, find the actual item you want to craft, look at the Icon of the Item point your cursor to the thumbnail of it and you will see a Red pin like picture in the picture of it, you will then notice it will show a detail information of it, when it does that, hold down your Ctrl Button down on your keyboard and click your left click on your mouse to see it directly link to your active Chat Window. Works great for asking in the Auction Channel when saying WTB or Wanting/Willing To Sell\n\nUpdate: 7/17/2014\n\nSome have been using the word Pay2win and thinking that just because you clear an area of enemies they respawn too quickly that it needs improvement, truth be told, yes the game does need improvement... but Name one game you played that doesnt need it. People that use the word Pay2win, you dont pay2win in this game, if you are refering to using In-Game Chips that are free in the game then its not Pay2win, its Working2win, you have to work to get money within the game to buy/make weapons etc. sure you can use the AH to buy weapons, but you arent using RL money to do so, unless you are paying RL money for Chips which isnt legal within the game, and yes the Marketplace have decent items that you can buy to trade off for chips within the game if you choose so, but you dont need Chips, you need Intellegence and good manners. Befriend the right people within the clans and you will always most likly get free help or get free items just for being Pendant and friendly. Karma goes a long ways. Now as far as Enemies appearing too quickly after death, think of this as the Prison in Kingman in Sector 1, its designed this way to give you more of an edge, which opens up the ability of having to rely on Friends/Team Work. Social Skills at best. If you are a loney, best advise check your build make a good power build for Solo Missions. Skip Hard missions for a low end Toon and go back later and beat that mission when your Character is stronger in the level.\n\nBest of luck and happy playing.\n\nThis game is worth playing at least once","November 25, 2013","true","681.3"," 562 of 633 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","562","633","2","10"

This may as well be a rant but I'm going to break this review down on some subcategories. I've been playing this game for a while and recommend it to new people. HOWEVER, for people playing the Alpha and Beta like I had, GOOD LUCK GETTING YOUR CHARACTER BACK. G1 basically said "screw you" to me and I haven't even been able to access my character from maybe...3-6 months ago? Not even? TERRIBLE.\n\nCATEGORY 1: Graphics\nNow the graphics AREN'T FALLOUT LEVEL. They're about average MMORPG...Like ArcheAge or TERA. Yes, you can set your graphics really high and I get about 50-60 frames on Highest, and when I lower about 110-120 FPS. They can use some work, but I noticed if you turn your graphics down even slightly, you loose A LOT of really nice detail that they put in there for fine polishing.\n\nCATEGORY 2: Gameplay (Combat, Movement, PvP, PvE)\nGameplay is...it's...it's alright. The combat is either 1st or 3rd person; and personally I would rather go 3rd. 1st person is extremely wierd and awkward, and rather dull as well. Now, as for movement- THE MAPS...IN THIS GAME...ARE SO FREAKING HUGE. I SWEAR. TO GOD. They split them up into "Sectors," and the last being "Alpha County" which is basically the end game area. Now, that being said, you can ATTEMPT to run there. However, I tried to get from Sector 1 to Sector 2, and didn't pack enough feed for my horse. I was left STRANDED IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE  with a horse that eventually DIED on me (No it didn't literally, but it may as well have with the speed it was going). So, if you're going between Sectors, be sure to grab a mount. But what I would LOVE to commend G1 for doing here is I have never...NEVER...IN MY LIFE..EXPERIENCED A LOADING SCREEN TRAVELLING. Only will you ever for teleporting and loading INTO the game. Travelling is loading-screen free, along with dungeons as well.\n\n-Mounts in the game are very nice to have and can be pricey at times, but they're well worth the buy. You have two types of mounts, machines and natural. Natural covers things like horses and some kick-♥♥♥ massive wolves you can ride on. And no they aren't your stereotypical wimpy ♥♥♥ wolves. These things are H-U-G-E and well worth getting in the quest line that you complete to get them (yes, you can actually get mounts through questlines; GOOD ONES not just starter ones). Machines covers ATV's, Bikes, Buggies, and Cars. But, the higher tier you get on mounts, THEY ARE GOD-AWFUL TO TAKE CARE OF. Be ready to spend some in-game cash to take care of them, 'cause some use "premium" fuel.\n\n-PvP in the game is fairly decent, involving some ethics of "skill" and dodging. However, if you want PvP, it is HORRIBLY balanced. Rifleman and snipers are left in the dark, along with some longer range classes while melee is the way to go. Oh, and you think carrying a massive club around is going to get you where you want? HELL NO. Yeah, you have the OCCASIONAL good heavy melee weapon that can get the job done; but no, you'll be faced with a load of VERY....VERY...VERY fast DPS melee weapons that literally shred you. So for PvP, get some very fast dual pistols or duel machetes/knives.\n\n-PvE/Questing is nice in the game and is pretty alright. However, questing can get..repetitive. "RUN HERE, SHOOT THIS, RUN BACK, TURN IT IN. DONE." Now, there are the exceptional quests that do have you doing some pretty cool things such as setting explosives on a vehicle or hunting down massive bosses. And the bosses in this game are VERY...VERY hard to beat without a group. Other than that...Not really much else for questing. I commonly found myself GRINDING THE ♥♥♥♥ out of high level enemies just to rank up. Took me HOURS and loads of cash for ammunition.\n\nCATEGORY 3: Community\nThe community is alright, but nothing different from any other MMO community out there. You're going to have those OBVIOUS dickwads and terrible people. Hell, you will even FIGHT...LITERALLY FIGHT over loot sometimes. Seriously...fk that. Even then, on GLOBAL channels people are being harassed. I had to step in once and tell someone to back off, which then lead to me reporting these asshats to the online GM (Game Moderator). Their accounts were issued a warning. Don't hope for the best from this community, 'cause you ain't gon'na receive ♥♥♥♥.\n\nNow....now comes the Pay-to-Play/Pay-to-Win. N-O. All things you will get to buff up your character is IN GAME. The only thing in this "cash shop" is going to be cosmetics and SOME boosts such as EXP. Overall, a fun game, good setting, terribad community, decent cash shop. ♥♥♥♥ TRAVELLING BY FOOT. IN. THE. ♥♥♥♥.\n\nEDIT: Funny Things in the game\n>Running around in a speedo with a gasmask on.\n>Crafting horses. With Kits. That's right. There's a kit to craft a horse.\nOh and one more thing, this game, as it is made by Gamers First, MAY NOT WORK ON SOME PEOPLE'S COMPUTERS. I don't know what is wrong with it but sometimes these games just don't want to work.","June 8, 2015","true","786.4"," 579 of 656 people (88%) found this review helpful 162 people found this review funny","88","579","656","162","40"

I'd like to start off with this game is not P2W (Pay to Win). PvE/Missions can be pretty fun given you're teamed with the right people - but generally the rewards are awful. The crafting system is pretty neat but has a few flaws (some recipes are odd given their level as well as some new endgame gear rendering some materials and gears utterly useless). PvP is pretty fun but it's not what it once was so you'll see a lot of people reminiscence about the old days. The community is probably the biggest killer for this game, most of which just whine about anything and everything.

And here it is.\nWell, one thing is for sure, it can be addictive if you like power play.\nIt's art style is obviously some post apocaliptic stuff, wich looks not that bad itself.\nBut seriously. this game is out since 2011 but yet it's full of gliches ,unfinnished animations and messed up or even missing sound files.That ruins the atmosphere.\n\nBut the thing that kept me playing for so long was the gameplay.\nFirst you start off with PAINTBALL GUNS AND SELF MADE SHIVES while rinding A FUKKING HORSE!.\nBut then, you see some heavily armored guys with cool Gas-Masks and badass looking rifles, revolvers, and machetes while driving a dune buggy or a pocket bike(love em).\n\nSo.what does a power player think? "I WANT THAT SH/T RIGHT NOW!"\nThen you realize how fast you can get EXP by just exploring and killing mobs wich acctaly makes really fun.\n(atleast at the lower levels.)\nOf course finnishing quests gives you WAY more exp than just killing stuff.But the thing is, most of the quests are not as repetitive as in the most MMORPGS.Well...not all of them are...let's say 50% of the quests you can get are repetitive.But that's something everybody who likes MMORPG's has to deal with.\n\nAnother thing is the crafting system.You can craft gear and equipment wich you could get from merchants and quest rewards 5-10 levels later.This includes....C@RZ!!!!!!!!!.you can craft your own ATV (wich is some sort of quad-bike) really early in game...if you do the right quest line.\n\nThe AI is....well...not that good acctualy.If an enemy detects you in it's view (wich is 360°...) it will follow you untill it's close enough to attack. If you run away from it it might give up the pursuit after like 8seconds.Usual stuff.\n\nBUT it's the way they follow you....you can't hide from then.THEY CAN  TELEPORT!\n\nExample: I was in a house sniping out of a window. I shot some ugly a$$ mutant who was standing outsite and doing...well nothing.I shot him and took about 20% of his health.Then i wanted to swich to my shotgun and wait for him to get into the house so i can shoot him from upstairs.but while i was swiching weapons: GRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWR. It was RIGHT INFRONT OF MY FACE.So yeah, teleportation.This sucks.\n\nBut i must say this game got a  LOAD of different enemies from Aligators to Zombies(and humans of course).Seriously a sh/t load. But sometimes....i though to myself "why in a game like this?" Im talking about animals....NORMAL A$$ ANIMALS like bears, pumas, wild dogs, rhinos,snakes,Zebras etc. It seems like they ran out of ideas and started taking models from zoo tycoon.\n\nANYWAY.

Hardly. But i will try at my best to keep it real as much as it is possible.\nFirst off, this game is not old. Its ancient.\nGraphics are, by todays standards, in world that saw titles such as Crysis, CoD:AW, Battlefield or Witcher series, laughable at best. It looks old, it ''plays'' old, but it has some of its charm for it.\nStory? Interesting, starting parts are very cohesive, but later on its starts to be very watered down.\nGameplay? That depends solely on player. There are multiple things you could do ingame (crafting, pvp, pve, farming, exploring, ect), and it works well on its part, but some features definately need to be worked on.\nI could spend hours explaining each part separately, but generally, game has complex crafting system, pve is fun as far pve goes in other games (there are bosses, instances, dungeons, team raids, ect), farming and harvesting are nice way of getting materials in large quantities if you dont mind posibility of being attacked while doing so (depending on place where you farm/harvest).\nOver the course of playing i met lot of interesting people. Some were nice, some were not, but all around, Fallen Earth has (or had) one of best comunities around in MMO's. There is always someone who will help out new player, give some usefull advice, share money, resources or items. There are also individuals who organise various community events.\nOne of biggest problems most post apocalyptic games have is that they are constantly being measured towards Fallout universe games. That is a problem, since most games do not measure up to Fallout.\nFallen Earth is one of games that comes very, very close to that. Not the same, but not too much diferent from it. Each of those games has its own pros and cons.\nSadly, at current time, it seems that G1 (company who owns FE) isnt too much interested in adding new things (although they do occasionally, but not to extent from before), but we always hope they will come to their senses and finish polishing the diamont that Fallen Earth is, and make it shine as it should.","January 9","true","225.3"," 255 of 295 people (86%) found this review helpful 37 people found this review funny","86","255","295","37","16"

At the start you might have some problems with the player community, trolls are all over the help channel and thats a problem that the GM's are always trying to prevent without much success. As you level up you start to make friends and enemies, specially when you join a faction, leveling up is the best part of the game and the world is huge, there are many ways to level up, you just have to choose the one you like. The real problem of the game are the community and the administration, about the community most of the players are rude and trolls, that's a fact, about the administration, some of the gm's are extremely rude and not polite,  and the game doesn't seem to have a anticheat engine, i was banned once just because i was part of a clan that had 1400 players and 1 or 2 were cheating, they did like "idk who is cheating so lets ban everyone". My account was unlocked because i never PvP and the cheaters were the PvP'ers, so joining a clan is not worthy and you are better alone. The old players are quitting or getting banned and the new players quit because of the trolls and lack of assistance, the game is dying very fast, but i still recommend this game for the good years that i spent there, i just wanted to prepare new players for what's coming for them :D","November 24, 2014","true","931.6"," 200 of 225 people (89%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","89","200","225","26","9"

The end game pvp is borderline pay2win with the way the shop works. The combat is aim/action based but still uses spammy hotkey skills. Overall the combat is worse than WoWs style due to how horrible the animation and unbalanced the skills are. The crafting takes a long time to do unless you pump money into the game. You can straight up buy the best vehicle in the game, and you have to buy a item to craft the best weapons. This is not fallout the mmo, this is a sad attempt to milk fallout fans.\n\nI have a lot of time in it from pressure by friends to play it.

It's not mandatory, and you can buy a months subscription any time. It gives a few bonusses, and when it's over it's over. Just like that. You can even buy them with in-game money.\n\nThe pvp fields however, are terrible. A broken system trying to balance things.

I wanted to say yes, and I would have, only if the Devs paid more attention to newer people who play the game for the very first time. I will first start off with a Pros/Cons list\n\nPros:\n\nDecent Graphics\nHUGE map\nGood combat (not just point in click, you actually have to aim and shoot)\nFactions is a neat idea ontop of clans\nPvP is for the most part, actually about skill\nLots of things to do at max level\n\nCons:\n\nHUGE map, but not much in it\nMelee is SO overpowered\nCan't trust faction members, you have half chance of them betraying you\nNot nearly enough support at lower levels (will explain later)\nRude community\nGM's don't do much\nHorrible customer support (will explain later)\n\nNow, when I say "Not nearly enough support at lower levels" I mean that there has been so many updates in the game to keep higher level'd people to keep playing, example, the G.O.R.E. update (that whole update was a mess), while there's no updates or anything for lower level'd people, the game has a decent tutorial system, but just like anything, a tutorial can only help so much, you actually need to do it to get better. If you want to craft, you need to scavenege in PvP areas for certain things and people usually just camp there waiting for people to show up to get stuff to craft and waste them before they even know what happens. The economy is pretty messed up, ammo, which costs nothing to make really, is sold for a pretty pricey amount, I understand supply and demand but holy crap, it's hard to get money as a lower level so ammo isn't going to be cheap for them.\n\nCustomer support... It literally means "customer support" if you're a f2p, they don't give a flying ♥♥♥♥ about you, (it's kind of like TF2, if you buy a single item from the online store, you unlock things, such as no money limit and all that), in fact, unless you bought something or have a subscription, you can't even file a ticket! Even people who are paying a montly fee for the game, they barely care about you. GM's hardly do anything to help you, but they do throw bans left and right on a power hungry trip. The community is rude, 80% of the people there are the ones who have still played when the game is P2P so they thing they're better than everyone in general.\n\nAs for factions, there are Techs, Travelers, Light Bearers, Enforcers, CHOTA and I forget what the last one is called, they're kind of like hippies, anyways, each one has a natural ally and a natural enemey, Techs hate the hippies, but Techs are allied with Travelers, but Travelers hate Light Bearers, etc etc, but unfourtantely none of that matters since if you if you're a Traveler, you'll get freaking shot up by another Traveler, otherwise the whole faction thing would be an awesome idea.\n\nI really liked the game at first, but it kept going downhill, the last thing I will say is the G.O.R.E. update, it released new weapons, a rifle, pistol and sword. Each one of those weapons were able to be upgraded 2 times, so it'd be rifle, upgraded rifle, upgraded upgraded rifle, but of course, each upgrade was harder to do, and the most upgraded rifle, could easily one hit kill someone, the DPS on the pistols (which shot in three burst (now fixed)) was insanely high, and well, for the sword, all melee is over powered so you get the idea on that. Some people made a clan to nerf the guns, some people made a clan to get rid of the update and killed anyone (the clan was always in a zerg) using the weapons, whether they were in the same faction or not. And then there was a clan that said to keep the update as is, and of course, they were using the Level 3 weapons. So they finally nerfed the weapons after about a month or so. Some people are wondering things like "Why is he even saying this?" Well, I'm saying this because if the Devs released an update that had insanely OP weapons without even thinking about if it's OP, or to test it or anything really, It really makes me not being able to trust them with future content, and also, the only reason the nerfed it, is because people were canceling their subscriptions until they nerfed it\n\nEdit: Typos and added a statement in the "Customer Support" part","December 5, 2014","false","741.9"," 121 of 139 people (87%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","87","121","139","7","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcswooft/recommended/113420/","mcswooft","Strelok","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcswooft/","157 products in account","Over all a pretty good game , but FE has it's share of issues as I'll discuss below.\n\nStory: There isn't one. There is a bare bones backstory to the different factions, what they're about, and what they offer....but that's about it. There's also general story lines in each settlement along with a ton of sidequests, but they do little to establish any kind of narrative.\n\nGameplay: FE works like a 3rd person shooter combined with WoW. You have to aim your own weapons (more on this in the PVP section) and there are a number of abilities you can activate during combat to give yourself an edge. This part of the game is done pretty well, combat is intuitive and if you pay attention to the tutorial, fairly easy to pick up.\n\nThe crafting system in this game is fantastic, almost every material needed to craft everything you could ever want can be salvaged from the world, harvested at player created farms, collected by player made harvesters in PVP zones, or purchaced off the Auction House.\n\nGraphics: This wasn't that big of a deal to me since I don't get hung up on graphics much, but this game was developed in 2009 and the graphics look pretty dated.\n\nPlayer population: I don't get alot of the complaints about this as at no point were any of the sector hubs empty. As a crafter I had no trouble making money off the Auction House as there were plenty of buyers for most of my products (once I figured out how to price them properly). You probably won't be tripping over other players when you're out in the middle of nowhere on missions, but is that a bad thing?\n\nF2p or pay to win? FE is good about this aspect as well. There is a cash shop where you can buy boosts to things like experience and faction point award rates; but there's no explicit thing you can buy in the cash store that will give you any advantage against an equally skilled and leveled player whom has never bought anything from the cash shop. The items you pay real money for are largely cosmetic or purely for convinence.\n\nPVP: This is by far the most mixed aspect of Fallen Earth. FE does reward pvp kills against different factions with a pvp currency, but in a move I haven't seen in any other MMO (except EVE), FE adds a reason to fight in PVP zones other than pvp currency, Harvesters. Harvesters are player created structures that generate crafting resources that hard to impossible to find outside PVP zones, and as you can guess can only be placed in PVP zones. When all goes well PVP is fun & rewarding, regardless if your faction holds the conflict town at the end of the day.\n\nSo what's wrong you ask? First off you're not likely to get a real taste of PVP untill you're close to level cap, granted if you hang around the level 20-45 conflict towns you might bump into an enemy faction; but if you do it's likely to be a clan blob of 5-10 people leveling their alts & steamrolling anyone in their path. The reason the lower level zones are so empty? The level debuff, which cripples anyone above a given conflict town's level range. The idea isn't a bad one: to keep tweaked out lvl 55s from curb stomping fledgling pvp players. But instead of bringing them on the level of people supposed to be in that zone it effectively renders the higher level player helpless; as a result nobody goes near conflict zones if there's even a chance they'll get hit with the level debuff.\n\nBut the absolute worst part is the proliferation of hackers (aimbotters and the like) in pvp. G1 does a pretty inconsistent job of keeping hackers in check; every once in a while they do a purge of hackers and PVP becomes fun again, but they always seem to come back. 90% percent of the challenge in pvp is consistently hitting your opponent, preferably with headshots which do considerably more damage, getting good at hitting and avoiding being hit is the core of PVP. So you can see how the fun gets quickly sucked out of this critical part of the game when you have ENTIRE CLANS able to sweep whole PVP zones simply by activating a 3rd party hack and racking up 100% accuracy while their opponents have no recourse what so ever. The fact G1 has been unable or unwilling to find a long term solution to this problem is by far FE's biggest problem.\n\nSummary: Fallen Earth is f2p game that isn't pay to win; that alone makes it worth a try. But digging deeper this game has plenty to offer in terms of PVE, crafting, and (if the hacker population is culled at the time) end game PVP. It's really up to what you value in an MMO if FE is worth your time; it certianly is for me despite it's faults.","November 23, 2014","true","556.5"," 200 of 272 people (74%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","74","200","272","19","2"

The environments look samey, until you go out of your way and find lovingly crafted areas people will never bother with.\n\nThe combat is clunky, if functional, and regularly gets screwed with by poor skill and item balancing.\n\nThe setting is actually surprisingly good, and there actually is an underlying story that you can play through at your own pace that is, shock and awe, actually pretty genuinely interesting, especially for your average scifi buff.\n\nNoticing a theme? There are some wonderful ideas, but for whatever reason, they just never quite pushed them far enough. The game is sandbox-y enough to be impressively wide open, but they didn't quite cut away from MMO Theme Park syndrome.\n\nThe crafting system is amazingly wide, allowing you to make damn near everything in the game just from things you can get yourself, except for the necessary endgame things that require asinine boss grinding or broken pvp point grind.\n\nHonestly it's getting depressing to talk about. It's one of those things that could have been flat out amazing, and for whatever reason, it just falls short. Still, it's the only modern MMO I've been able to stomach for any length of time, so there's that.","March 16, 2014","true","867.5"," 85 of 101 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","85","101","0","0"

That is an understatment. You may have heard this game is full of chat and PvP trolls. Well I am not going to argue against that. The things is I would not normally tolerate that from a game. It is unacceptable.\nThe game however is in a league of its own. I cannot take my business elsewhere. There is no Elsewhere. Fallen Earth is an MMORPG that does not always look the prettiest but actually provides you with a massive world where there is a point to going off exploring. Resources are everywhere. Everything is needed in someway and almost everything has to be crafted by players.\nCharacter development is very customizable both in terms of appearance and performance. All clones are created equal but some are developed poorly. It is an easy system to learn, but much tweaking availiable when mastered.\nFallen Earth really is the MMO you can play your way. Every clone can find a niche. Fallen Earth is not at all P2W, with the only advantages being convenience and cosmetics for cashers. Even a subscription can be bought with in game currency.\nThe community has many helpful players and questions are answered quickly via the help channel. If you start playing use the help channel. The game is quite simple to learn but not very well explained by the game itself. Stick with it. Each in-game sector brings fun and different game mechanics. Do not be in a hurry in this game. Speed levelling when you don't know much is a very bad idea.","November 25, 2014","true","783.4"," 112 of 150 people (75%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","75","112","150","19","2"

It spans over sectors and the overall map is bigger then triple A titles such as GTA V and Just Cause 2.\n\n+Character customisation. When you start the game you have the ability to change the appearance of your character, and during the game you can equip things that can add benefits and features, like dusters or combat suits.\n\n+Clans and teams. In game there is a team system that people can join into so that you can complete a mission together, and some missions require that. The team system also allows voice chat. There is also a clan system that works like normal, and the clan has a special "clan vault" that they can use.\n\n+Mega server. All players are on one server, but it works due to the map size.\n\n+Vehicles. The game has various mounts, such as horses and even giant mutated chickens, along with motorbikes, ATVs, dune buggys, and more.\n\n-Microtransactions. Since this is a free to play game, it is a given. You can buy almost any item in the game on their store.

It is really BAD, it just isn't common.\n\n-Buggy. Some bugs will occur in the game, but there is usually a fix. Usually.\n\nTL;DR: This game is a pretty fun first person post apocalyptic online RPG.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/supersizeyeti/recommended/113420/","supersizeyeti","Zee Skipper","http://steamcommunity.com/id/supersizeyeti/","141 products in account","Fallen Earth is an MMORPG that doesn't have a lot to offer in terms of combat, environments, mounts and interesting gear.\n\nNOTE: My character is only level 17 after the time that I've played. This review is based on my 56 hours total that I've played.\n\nCombat:Instead of doing the select and launch all nukes at highlighted targets you instead have an aiming system for the combat.\nThis feels fresh at first as it hasn't been done an awful lot in MMORPGs to my knowledge, but the aiming isnt executed very well and doesn't go well together in combination with the rest of the combat.\nIt feels out of place that you cant really dodge attacks in a system like this where moving and fighting can be done. Your enemies attacks can't miss you, but your attacks can miss them easily.\n\nThere's three forms of combat weapons. You can use melee, pistols or rifles/shotguns. To be fair only melee and rifles are the most useful as pistols are in an awkward spot between melee and rifles. Theyre more efficient at close range since you can dual wield, but leave you vulnerable to groups of enemies. A melee type character as far as I'm aware of is usually build for that kindof combat and the rifles give you a safe way to play the game and pick off targets from a distance.\n\nThe world and transport:The game's world is big, but empty. It has no interesting places to show off and the graphics aren't very pleasing either. I understand that this is supposed to be a post-apocalyptic setting but that doesn't mean everything in existance should not be very pleasing to the eye. The environments are already bland, empty and occasionally filled with resources and enemy mobs.\n\nThe game offers you a two means of transport. You can either go on foot or use a mount. The mounts exist out of horses, quadbikes, motorcycles and cars. Mounts use their respective forms of fuel in order to travel. This makes it more attractive to take mounts that are more fuel efficient over any other mount that you'd actually prefer to use. Having to pay attention to how much "fuel" you have left and\n\nQuests:The majority of quests, if not all of them, are fetch quests or 'kill x amount of y'. Nothing interesting.\n\nStory:There isn't really a story except that you are a clone and thats very special and there  are a lot of factions who dislike eachother. The factions don't do much else as far as I'm aware. You can gain reputation with them but wether this will have some impact on the game isn't very clear. Also there isn't really a story line to follow as far as I'm aware.\n\nDances:The dances are probably the only reason why some of my friends and I sticked to this game after the awful introduction. I wouldn't have played this on my own, now I think of it.\n\nSummary:Unsatisfying combat, bland environments, lack of interesting gear/loot and a terrifying amount of fetch quests make this game a boring experience. Looking back at it I don't understand why I even put this many hours into it.","July 12, 2014","false","55.7"," 274 of 439 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","274","439","0","6"

This may seem like nonsense to you, but a lot of games out there these days simply tack on the story to the rest of the game, rather than the other way around (as it should).\n\nWith a game like Fallen Earth, you can tell that the story came first, and everything else was built around there; from the architecture, weapons, vehicles, and equipment, it all makes sense within the setting. With the way the game's story is, there isn't the problem of "when everyone in an MMO is the chosen character, no one is", and the characters within the game treat you as a person and not The Big Cool Hero. Extremely refreshing.\n\nIf that doesn't say anything, let me tell you something about my hours in this game (on the other version of Fallen Earth, as there are two in Steam, as for a little while FE wasn't on Steam): I have over 2000 hours in the game, a feat surpassed only by my GMOD hours.","September 29, 2014","true","382.0"," 62 of 89 people (70%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","70","62","89","10","2"

It's free to get. It's free play. Pretty much the only frustrating con to being a free player is having only one crafting queue slot and the 9 red chip (poker chips are currency and which you have white blue red and yellow chips) max. Do a couple free surveys and earn some GamersFirst credits and you can buy something cheap on the marketplace and get rid of the chip limit and up your crafting queue to like 4.\n\nAlright now that I got that out of the way lets see what's next. I guess I could talk about the game state as of these past couple of weeks. This is an older game. The graphics aren't the best. But I like them. It feels as though the game has died a little bit inside and there are actually times in which a town can be empty of players, beside the couple stragglers that leave their player online and craft (it's not required to do so but if you use a crafting accelerator item it is). This is no elses fault but of your own though. IF you play people will play more often.\n\nI enjoy the crafting system if I may say so myself. You can pull up a window that has a neatly organized (well somewhat :P) list of everything you have learned to craft. Just click it then the "craft" button and it adds it to the crafting queue, as long as you have the required materials of course. Pretty much almost everything in the game has been crafted by another person. Whether it be vehicles or your favorite gun, or even that kebab that's been sitting in your inventory. Of course you get generated items through merchants or missions but this game allows for the better quality items to be instead crafted, thus relying on peoples ability to craft for a good economic system.\n\nLets see, what's another major characteristic about the game. Oh the pvp. Pvp/pve is pretty balanced throughout the game. Most places you are at are pve locations. There are locations that  are strictly PVP. You can turn on pvp and fight in pve areas. You can turn off PVP (has a timer buff as to keep people from shooting and switching) and not be bugged in PVE areas. You can also simply just choose to duel someone and lose at low hp without actually dieing. There is even a window to queue up for Blood SPorts pvp minigames.\n\nLike I said this game is very social dependent to have fun, unless your one of those people who just like to be off in a secluded location and grind through all your levels. Which in that case you can do that to on here:P.  As said before the game is old , but in it's time it has made it very playable. It has it's bugs sure but what game doesn't. I barely see any of those "hackers" as kids like to call them nowadays. Most of time it's kiddie stuff like the auto bot script stuff.\n\nI think that about sums up the major points of the game. I could go on more about it, just don't feel like it. :P I hope I have influenced atleast one more player to join. Could use a couple more newbies that I could pick on.\n","August 26, 2015","true","452.3"," 46 of 62 people (74%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","74","46","62","8","0"

The software generates a hash code for your name (around 20 characters in length including upper/lower case letters, numbers, and hyphens ( - ) ) and I have to say... the support team is *FAR* less than helpful (their response : we can't change unique user names)...\n\nOkay, let me rant a moment... so what they're saying is their programmers can't use SQL? Can't use PHP? Can't... um... access their OWN databases? I think not... I think someone is too lazy to correct their mistake. Log in with an e-mail because "that's the username"... but tried logging in with my e-mail and it says "invalid username" but using the hash... all hunky dory.\n\nThere, that's out of the way, let's get to the game itself and not the customer service.\n\nThe game is old-school. The graphics sit somewhere between Fallout 2 and Fallout 3. The NPCs and "Monsters" are all standing around in one place, tethered to a spot (where they will chase after you for a predetermined distance before giving up and returning to their spawn) ~ a lot like EverQuest 1. The world itself is a little on the empty side, but I cannot honestly say if it remains this way (the internal zones and buildings are pretty cool, and for a game that is set in a wasted world, it's as desolate as it should be).\n\nThe story-line is thoughtful and creative, even if it's a little flat and tired. It is interesting, it is engaging, it's just that it's a bit 'old.'\n\nThe GMs are super helpful, and I've seen them online every time I've logged in. The help channel is busy, and responsive (I can't even begin to say how refreshing that is)! That said... they have the typical censored chat system that is pretty much par for the course... but don't bother censoring your own words (like: aw s*** that sucks) because a GM will threaten to mute you for language (a redundancy which borders on zealous). Hardly anything to complain about... keep it clean (and PG so you don't offend the super-innocent teenagers playing this game - note sarcasm).\n\nMovement is a bit cumbersome and unweildly ~ but once you're used to it it isn't too bad (such as hitting tab or the middle mouse button to turn on targeting, and therefore a locked mouselook instead of free-look). It's pretty hard to get the camera around front of your character (but it's entirely possible I've just overlooked something).\n\nSkills, stats, levelling, trades... a detailed system. A wonderfully detailed system. APs (which I may mistakenly believe to mean "action points") are granted frequently in small doses for everything from quest completion to simply levelling up your trade skills. Mousing over anything will give you a clear and detailed description of what that thing is for and what it does and what it effects - I've long desired that games did this, some do, but FE starts with this right out of the gate... they do NOT leave you in the dark (as long as you can read at a Junior High level, it's sweet).\n\nQuesting is a bit weird to get used to - the map (okay, the map... WOW... if you like detailed maps that don't hold your hand, but make some pretty obvious markers... then this map system is for you - detail, detail, detail... easily one of the most beautiful map systems I've seen in a game in a LONG time)... anyway, the map... shows a little red X on your radar that when you mouse-over it will show you the name of the quest it's for. There are no indications of distance on the radar or for quests, and some quests are a bit ambiguous (really, they just don't hold your hand there - read it... then figure it out ya lazy bums)!\n\nWill I continue playing? You bet. What is the not free to play? Buying keys for dropped lockboxes. Unlocking your entire wardrobe. Paying for premium content (usually access to skills, timers, clothing, zones, etc) in three different monthly plans (from about $12 to $30), not so bad - but pretty steep considering you can get a great deal more out of a game like LotRO (Lord of the Rings Online) for about $15/month, with far better quality and content. Still, not too bad, save that it's comfortably on the expensive side (especially for what it is and offers).\n\nDo I recommend it? Yes. Get past the opening stuff. Put some points into Intelligence and Perception (both of those increase your maximums for tradeskills), and READ THE QUESTS.\n\nIf you don't like reading, or actively engaging a game... this isn't for you. I, however, love reading the content in a game (I want to see what other writers and creative teams are doing with their work) and I enjoy a challenge. As such, I really enjoy this.\n\nIn short, a rocky start, some negative experience with the customer service and GMs, a bit unweildly and old-school, and expensive beyond the F2P... but a game that grows on you quickly and really eats up time (that's a mark of a good game right there).\n\nTest it out. If you liked Fallout 2 and 3, then you'll probably enjoy this. I don't think it's a "long term" game (as far as playability) in my books, but that's simply my own opinion and nothing more. Plenty of players are really enjoying this game, and that speaks volumes about the overall content and quality.","October 2, 2014","true","10.2"," 72 of 107 people (67%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","67","72","107","7","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Baseik/recommended/113420/","Baseik","Baseik","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Baseik/","26 products in account","Fallen Earth is a post-apocalyptic game with sci-fi technology. It was released September 22, 2009 and with that said... Making a game with let's just go with a major title, CoD or Battlefield like graphics...It'd need a engine to process it and this is a game already finished. So the graphics are dated, even at it's highest setting can look like a mudded mess.\n\nYou know what, no, no, I wanted to be a bit nice to this game. Look at my screenshots. The mane of my horse, a free mount is beyond s***. Hell my shadow while in first person is cut in half at the waist, and there's no first person animations what so ever. There are in third, but that is just horrid. If that isn't bad enough you get spells and skills like in World of Warcraft..I'm playing at max settings mind you. There are no animations, effects, nothing like that for anything you use in first person. So I don't know if I'm using a poison spell or a spell that s***s f***ing rainbows. Should I mention if I try to heal while in combat that I'll actually heal my enemy? WHAT!?! Oh yes, you have to TARGET yourself to HEAL yourself.\n\nThis game is a hardcore knock off of Fallout 3 and New Vegas. The graphics are the same if not worse then both, huge lack of animations, glitches, and just awful, dreadfully poor, sloppy and LAZY design work. If that doesn't p*** you off then what about the fact you have to swap from mouse to aim every 2 minutes to click on a quest, item, object, whatever it be..Ending tutorials, etc.. Oh your mouse cursor is what they use as the game cursor. That's just f***ing pathetic work.\n\nAnother fun thing is crafting, and timers. They haven't yet, but I'm damn sure a single timer can easily eventually be an hour if not longer. By the way you can only craft ONE, ONE ITEM AT A TIME IF you do not buy their stupid VIP. Want more, I've yet to go into PvP and frankly I don't think I want to with the other reviews I've read. Already see paid content is able to move ridiculously faster, and it seems at best if you don't pay for the game you're getting a horse. My mind is just blown. That's just mounts/vehicles...What about these keys and boxes and crap that give amazing gear you CANNOT GET ANYWHERE ELSE?! No. Just no. It figures, any title under "GamersFirst" is nothing but a pryamid scheme for your money. I'm dead serious too, look at APB: Reloaded and APB.\n\nOh and the learning curve on this game might as well be a f***ing mountain flying in the air. If it wasn't for having looked at my keybinds, and even then I'd be having difficulty as hell. Don't forget, no animations, effects, etc. with most spells/skills/s***s/f***s I don't give about! The game is about you though and the other 20 or so people around, you died at the Hoover Dam and now you're a clone. Should I mention everyone here and everywhere else f***ing hates clones? You might as well be a Jew in NAZI Germany. Question, what game allows jumping that can't allow turning while in mid-air? Answer, Fallen Earth. S*** YOU NOT. The map could be really big, the thing is though... I DON'T HAVE THE F***ING ABILITY TO SCROLL AROUND THE MAP.\n\n3/10\nI will never recommend playing this game, even to see if it's really that bad. It's worse.","October 12, 2014","false","7.7"," 67 of 99 people (68%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","68","67","99","16","4"

Some good, some bad.\n\nFor starters lets start with the story... there isnt one. Dont play this game if you like mmorpgs that have stories. Its just not there.  What story there is is poorly executed.  Having played on two different accounts and started in two different regions of the starter map, the story is boring.  Frankly I'm more intrigued in the happenings of each NPC settlement than the actual story of your individual character.\n\nNext the world itself.  Be forwarned if you do not, and repeat DO NOT invest in any form of transportation (i.e faster horses and cars) you will not have a fun time.  It is a gigantic walking sim otherwise.  Other than that the world is freaking huge (clocked a 1.5 drive with a dune bug from zone 1 to zone 4 on a road)  There is plenty to do, plenty to mine, and plenty to kill.    There are a assortment of missions (will discuss details later) dotted all across the landscape.  And the landscape itself isnt  that much of an eyesore even at high settings.  But sometimes when traveling in a dungeon it seems it takes FOREVER just to reach the boss (which has been stated before in other reviews to be bullet sponges, which is very true.) So there are no real pros or cons with this.\n\nCrafting is an interesting part of the game, though from when i first started has changed drastically when i first started this game.  When I first started as a free to play player, I could craft as much as i want without limits, although it has some flaws.  For instance if you ever wish to progress a specific skill some have to be bought if you cant make the skill book yourself, you must buy it with in game money.  Why gripe about this you wonder?  BECAUSE THE BOOKS ARE OVERPRICED AS HELL!  True you can grind for a couple hours and start selling stuff you get to get the money or make different stuff to sell at the auction house (I'll discus this later.)  And the process of leveling up each skill gets me the most.  You can craft the most difficult item or the most basic (to a cap) and you only get one skill point per item you craft for each specific crafting tree.  Another flaw was most likely implemented after I stopped playing the game for a while.  Right now for free2play players you can only craft a single item at a time, which was reallly frustrating for me since I started with being able to craft as many items as i wanted in a que.  Other than this the crafting system is engaging for those willing to spend time with it and most resources are easy to get.\n\nCharacter creation isnt really that important but i will discuss it.  There is some variety in how you create your character, though it could have done a little better.  Combined with the crafting system you can make your character look pretty cool. Character progression is an entirely different story.  If you really want this game i will give you a few hints:\n1) Invest in the mutations.  These mutations will help you greatly in pvp and pve combat, greatly increasing your chances of survival for your fellow players and killing your enimies.  Pick wisley though.  You either want to invest in crowd control and healing or full on offense with negative buffs.  never invest in both it will take forever to get anything useful.\n2) invest in one and only one weapon skill.  As someone who tends to try to be a jack-of-all trades in mmos dont try to invest in multiple weopon skills (unless you really want to.) Pick one maybe two and stick with it becasue the stats of your weapon skills and another skill (i.e Rifle skill with precision skill)  determines your dmg ratio.\nAs for the skills themselves along with the mutation skills, there are way to many skills. Sure you have plenty of skill points to spend; "the total amount your character can have spent on them level 55 is 1960 AP." (febase.mmometaguide.com/ss-1/) However this would take forever.  My highest lvl character is 49 and that took the majority of hours i put into this game.  All in all character progression without the pay2win experience isnt worth for free2play players.\n\nThe community is a hard topic to describe.  It does have the common trolls and mean clans galore with a few diamonds in the rough.  The mass majority of players when i first strarted were some of the nicest perople i have ever met in any mmo experience.  I was in a really large clan that had four different offshoots coming from all six of the factions the game.  Of course this was my first experince. After my second go at the game the community had pummled down to nothing more than a bunch of trolls. Thats all I have to say about that.\n\nThe economy is my last subject.  The economy is by far the most annoying part of this game.  Unlike WOW which has a real fluctuating economy, Fallen Earths economy is set in stone and is overpirced.  For all the lowest tier items (scrap) they are expensive for a world that doesnt genrate money for loot on hostile NPCs. Unless you grind for hours like i did and make and sell a whole bunch of loot and items you will be poor as the bum that lives on your nearest street corner. Also beware for those who do join or make a clan, protect your clan vault as if it were your most important valuable in your life.  I have heard countless stories of clan members stealing huge stacks of loot, materials, and thousands of in game money and leaving the clan.  Although unimportant to the economy it had to be said.  A final note, the auction house is a joke.  There are obvious players being trolls trying to sell a rare item (mind you for only a single piece) at a unreasonably high amount of chips (in game money.) Though there are some reasonable people like myself who focus on creating stuff or collecting loot to get our wealth by actually being fair in our prices in the auction house.\n\nAll in all Fallen Earth is a below average mmo as it stands right now.  There are some bugs here and there, but they do a good job at fixing them.  The graphics are mediocre at best and the progression is skewed by the common pay2win in most free2plays.","March 8, 2015","false","522.1"," 29 of 38 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","29","38","0","0"

Unlike Star Wars Galaxies, it is also very simplistic. Gather materials, click button, wait until done. No different qualities of materials, or experimenting on items, all gear is the same. (I use SWG as an example, as I think it had the best crafting that hasn't been matched yet in a MMO, IMHO) If you plan on making all your own gear, prepare to level slowly, as crafting take a longer time to keep up to date.\n\nFair free to play model.

MOBs are everywhere including areas that do not need it but in areas you would expect it, it is empty. it is a game that you can play and reach max level really quick if you want. No real story and some quests are terrible while others are set perfectly without any rhyme or reason. Tradeskills are about 90% to where they need to be but better than most other games out there. Storage is okay but needs more upgradablity.Help channel is okay but don't bother trying to talk to the GMs about anything because they really don't care and would rather help their friends not you.","September 3, 2015","false","206.1"," 27 of 38 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","27","38","2","0"

Okay, so the interface and AI are pretty clunky and without buying premium you're limited to certain items, levels, etc...\n\nDespite these cons, Fallen Earth is surprisingly fun and immersive. The ability to do basically whatever you want, be it quest, scavenge, grind, or fight other players in PvP, is what makes Fallen Earth so addicting. No matter your level there is always something to do or something new to discover. Heck, even though I have 150+ hours into this game I'm still questing in the first sector and I'm barely past Level 19. This shows how much there is to do.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game to someone who is patient enough to get used to the clunky UI and look past the cons of this game. It's not your typical plug-n-play shooter types, and that's what I love about this game.

Previously there were skills, and mutations, that were not worth taking for any given reason. This isn't the case anymore.\n\nMissions beyond Sector 1 are terrible unless unlocking vanity items or social boosting items, you're better off spending your time killing NPCs that give the best XP for the least effort (rats for example) because the Devs are most likely never going to fix this issue.\n\nThe "story" within the missions is still good, but you will feel cheated after completing a 5 hour long quest that you could have earned 30x the experience along with 20x the profit/reward.\n\nWeapon choices for PVP will feel very "one sided" in 1v1. I recommend not going "Rifle" if you plan to fight 1v1 in PVP. In Group fights is where it shines, I strongly recommend avoiding Assault or Battle Rifles at level 55.\n\nLack of updates since the previous major update (8/1/2014) beyond increasing "Dome Tokens" have lead to a heavy decline in population. DO NOT EXPECT THIS GAME TO HAVE REGULAR UPDATES, the Devs are depressing when it comes to this. Not to mention never finishing projects completely... they simply move on to the next "big" project.\n\nExamples : Terminal Woods, Alpha, TC, and Dome, None of these are "finished", just "acceptable".\n\nIf you plan to get to end-game, ignore ALL previous weapons/armor at 55. As there is no progression into the newer armors, it is best to save all your chips/DT for the AP weapons and GT Armor since they are the same price or lower than the previous armors.\n\nDO NOT EXPECT TO NOT DIE TO SOMEONE WITHIN YOUR FACTION IN PVP : It is intended through lore and mechanically for your own faction to beable to kill you in PVP, this is indeed a wasteland and should be treated as such.\n\nTHERE IS NO GROUP CONTENT WORTH DOING IN THIS GAME : It is nice to bring a friend, but don't expect to find some amazing place for your 8-32+ group that's challenging... let alone rewarding :(\n\nI only play now to help others learn the game, kill rerollers (those who remake after previous bans), and PVP if there is any.\n\n\nWhile the game is old, it is limited by F2P standards I would recommend it for a game to play if you enjoy MMOs, crafting, and of course PVP. Only downside, don't expect to master 1 skill, it's better to be great all across the board on skills to give yourself the best advantage in PVP at least.","June 3, 2012","true","133.7"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","0"

I don't play very many, but the ones I do play I tend to play a lot. More often than not I'll find myself getting bored of whatever game I'm trying out within the first few hours. I decided to try this game out and take a chance on the mixed reviews after seeing it on Steam many many times.\n\nAt 30 hours in I can safely say I'm hooked. The crafting system really is AMAZING. Potions, poisons, medical kits, weapons, armors, clothing, dyes, VEHICLES (including but not limited to motorcycles, ATV's, cars, trucks), and you can craft create temporary building and camps. That's just a small portion of it.\n\nSkill system is easy to use and straight forward, combat is familiar and was easy to transition to, not sure what else I can say.\n\nOn the negative side, the game world coudl use some more clutter. Wandering around the map feels quite barren. And the server downtimes need to be addressed. This is killing this game for me despite all the great potential it has. I've been playing it for 5 days and the servers have gone down for 1 hour intervals at least 3 times and has gone down for extended intervals on anther two seperate occasions. This is on top of regular maintenance. This needs to be fixed ASAP.

Well right now the answer is nothing, with population so low there's no pvp going on, which is actually really fun, even though hard to learn how to do it properly.\n\nThis game is not pay to win, I mean I really enjoyed game at first and bought steam package, I don't regret getting it, you can purchase subscription or buy tradeable premium for ingame currency, I bought a lof of them, I always had commander premium and it wasn't hard to earn enough game currency for it, there're multiple ways to make money in game, pve and pvp(but that's not the case now probably as population dropped heavily). I like the game so much that I would even pay for subscription anyway if not one but, and that's a big one, the G1, who bought the game doesn't develop it anymore, they keep 3 or 5 ppl on the staff and they do very little in game, it feels very abandoned. There's no anticheat and  there's also ways to dupe in game, they can't fix that, even though some dupers sent them mail telling how to fix it, but they didn't do anything.\n\nit's no longer an mmo, more like a bunch of ppl online, on top of that they downgraded their servers a few times, so there's much more lag, the content that G1 did is unfinished, and it's just a dead side of the map where nothing happens, they ruined the game and as long as they own it I can't recommend this game.\n\n","May 19","false","721.5"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","2"

I am really having a blast playing it right now. Steep learning curve keeps a lot of the 'usual' mmo crowd out. This I like! Huge open sandbox world. Think I read over 5,500 quests and 11,000 square miles of area? MASSIVE!\n\nThe game has some amazing developers under its wing too. They are trying to improve the game daily with small updates, bug fixes and is one of the minor few games which takes community thoughts and feelings into persepctive.\n\nGreat community and if you get stuck or need a friend to help there are help chats, auctions, private chats & town chats (In-game!)\n\nClass-less characters to play as you wish and 6 factions and the factions are not all against each other but have their enemies, arch enemy, and allies among those 6. The character design feature is superb also! Very open and user friendly.\n\nThe graphics and model designs are not the best in quality terms but its not about the graphics on Fallen earth. The quests and community is the main focus in my opnion; which is great! Got a nice mix of PvE and PvP. PvP in certain areas as well as conflict towns in the higher zones.\n\nConcluding, Fallen Earth is a great game if you have a varied lifestyle with a couple of hours every week to login and play.

You can also  lvl up  geometry skill which will allow you to mine higher lvl rocks and get more resorces from them, as far as pvp goes i have yet to try it out. I find that melee is a good skill to start lvling up right away because it can become handy later on, also the quest system is nice filled with different varieties and you never feel as if you have done the same quest more that twice.The map is HUGE and would take hours to explore and going out past a certain point you will find that enemies will get tougher very quickly which will force you to lvl up before exploring more which is good because when you die from a hard enemy and then go lvl up a little bit when you go back to that same enemy you feel like you are getting stronger and making progress towards you'r character. I very much enjoy a few hours a day of fallen earth and would easily give it an 8/10 for mmo standards. I have not seen many fps open world mmorpg's around and this is quite the package if you are looking for a game like this.","February 10, 2014","true","14.7"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

I for one can forgive them but it confuses why these problems exist.  Problems like animation, hitboxes, crafting system.  They all seem outdated and worse versions of what other games do.  The first person animations are monstrous, but the third person animations are alright.  The hitboxes can be a bit wierd but bearable.  The crafting system is a click, wait, get kind of system, where you get the materials, hit craft, wait a while (5 min to 10 hours depending on the item.) then you go and get it from the menu.  Also something that bugged me was that this game came out in 2009 originally and that they had the nerve to put a price on this game before it went free to play.  This game is a good free to play but paying for it is a horrible and idiotic idea, simply because the polish in this game is next to nothing.  This game does get in depth later on though with factions, vehicle (Better vehicles I should say, since you get a horse ealy on.), and more advanced and better looking weaponry.  The quests are interesting and sometimes challenging but luckily I had friends to help me out, this also improved the amount of fun that I had with this game. When you first get in it may look like another hotbar World of Warcraft like game (I actually like WoW it's just that many MMO's borrow so much from it that it gets boring.) but all those keys are 100% option for a more "magic" oriented player.  The tutorial is horrible, boring, and useless aside from simply teaching new players and should be skipped if you have played before.  Now onto the better parts of this game.  It progression is slow but it feels good to finally get that first revolver after using pellet guns for a while.  The custimization in this game is good ingame but in character creation it is limited but acceptable.  The towns feel alive due to all the other players going around doing their missions, crafting, learning, etc.  Now for a more personal opinion, I found this game alright, it gave me fun times with my friends but sometimes I would get locked getting resources in an area for crafting and trading.  I saw myself just joking around a lot before heading out to do a mission, which my friends would have fights over because some would go ahead of each other and it honestly annoyed me.  This game also has PvP which I never participated in since I had no real reason to.  This game gave me some rewarding progression (Which was created from the effort and time put in),  confussion as to why it isn't more polished and improved, and a annoying but sometimes fun time with my friends. If I would have to give this a score it would honestly be a 5/10.  I see the appeal here it's just I can't get over why it is like it is now: a messy MMO shooter with mechanics which could be improved easily.  I recommend this game to someone who takes MMO's as serious as a mature Arma player.","November 27, 2013","true","21.9"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","13","20","0","0"

It's not meant to be that realistic, it's a god-dang mmorpg for christ's sake. Examples; Enemies can melee you with a corkscrew from 10 meters. You kill a flock of prearie chikens (a mutated chiken that has nothing in common with an actual chiken) and any of them won't defend each other. A custom made Closet Rod is more deadly than a sledge hammer. And the enemies will kill you if you try to flee from combat, like they will not simply stop following you.\n\nThe good thing in the game is that it isn't Pay 2 Win, althought outside the safe zones it's full pvp war out there. Most of the games weapons and armors/clothing is usually made by YOU. That's right. Crafting takes a huge part in the game, as you make a ragged t-shirt from cotton and such. Later on you can craft better equipment from better ingedients etc. As usual, you'll get better in scavenge, harvest and skin skills by using them constantly. It can be quite dull at times, sure.\n\nIn the short version, this combination of S.T.R.I.K.E.R. and fallout has potential, but that's about it. It takes way too much effort to get it working, and even then you will ask your self, was it worth it? See for yourself, it's free anyway.","May 17, 2014","false","3.7"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","2"

In 2 days I have already put 20 hours into the game. This game has so much to do, and so much is going on, that you are spoiled with missions and activities! If you're looking for an RPG in the Post-Apocoliptic era, or you just wanna play a game similar looking to Fallout, than this is a game I highly recommend downloading, whats even better is if you don't like it you're not losing anything because its FREE, and I am surprised it is after how much fun this game is. I highly recommend this game to anyone looking to play a good game and have fun with other players. This game has most pieces to an RPG game such as Clans, Events, Tons of Weapon, Armour, and Clothes! It also has skills you level up after getting AP Points, which yout hen use to upgrade your skills. The crafting system is also nice, and you can basically craft almost anything.\n\n(PS if you're trying to download this game and you think the Update downloader is stuck, its not. I also thought mine was stuck and after looking up how to fix it I found no solution when turns out I just wasn't being patient. I started the downloader and left it on over night and it was finished by morning!

For the games ****y exploits and the various bugs, glitches and what-not, it can actually be playable. As lots of other reviews have said, "The community is ♥♥♥".. It's not too bad if you're with the right people. The Player versus Enviroment is fun, very well balanced but I can't say the same about Player versus Player, it's  not really something that is balanced.  It's fun, sure.. But, not when you first start and you don't know what you're doing.\n\nThe starter quests are fun for a little while until they become repetative, but it's quite easy to get over that. For the thousands of quests there are, you can't really say "I have nothing to do". The huge world offers a wide variety of different enviroments to explore, some full of danger at every corner. As you progress throughout the game, you're going to need some help at some point. Implemented in the game is it's ability to create and join clans around the Grand Canyon. I like this aspect of the game, but, it's extremely "NOT" lore friendly, I think.\n\nFor what is now a F2P game, it's worth it.

It changed hands to Gamersfirst and the game has continued to be developed. (Gamersfirst might not be the best group to own the game but they keep it running)\n\nThe game is the culmination of a lot of different games that always got some things right but never went any further.\n\nThe game as a very robust crafting system with nearly 90% of the items found in game being craftable. (The other 10% is usually unique item drops or materials for crafting.)\n\nThe combat system while at times can be a bit wonky requires people to aim their shots and attacks (Something that a lot of people look for in an MMO today)\n\nIf you enjoy games like Fallout, Fallout 2, Fallout Tactics, Wasteland, or Wasteland 2 (This is in regards to the Genre and crafting/party system) Then this game is most likely going to fall into the Niche of games that you'll die for.\n\nThe game has a die-hard fan base that has kept it runing through the transitions and the bad times. The game has undergone a ton of updating and in the near future another sector will be added to the game. (Essentially another expansion.)\n\nMany people discredit the game because of graphical glitches or a poorly designed tutorial. (Which graphics don't matter but the tutorial is credible.) Yet the game continues to find ways to bring people into the world.\n\nThe mythos of the game is incredible. The storylines are interesting and they dialogue is engaging. (Dialogue here meaning Text, you have to read =P ) I cannot find a lot to say about the game that is at fault.\n\nPvP has consequences on the world and the Factions that battle it out are fun to engage with and make the game interesting to say the least with "Politics" in game. The economy is for the most part player driven and this engages people even more that like to play the market.\n\nAll in all this game is a solid 7/10 and hell it's free, so what are you waiting for?

I've spend some time in this game like two years ago, was focusing on pvp when more and more p2w and overall pvp performance annoyed and bored me enough to quit. Some ideas in this game are awesome, but increasing amount of things to buy and how they are being introduced to players kinda sucks. I understand game needs to earn for itself to be maintained and feed developer's families but well... it's sad, because in my opinion potential for something great and unique became wasted.\n\nI loved crafting, yet amount of time and specific materials required to craft late game stuff gets insane. Of course you can help your self with $.\n\nI loved free roaming and gathering stuff, but it doesn't feel like wasteland if just outside town you can find areas filled with stuff to gather.\n\nWays to customize your character (visually) are nice.\n\nSkills system and ways how you can develop your character is interesting.\n\nPvE is boring and just bad. For a fps-like game AI is terrible.\n\nCommunity was nice (when i played).\n\nAnd finally, PvP. The idea to make most resource rich areas pvp-free areas is great. Too bad it's faction-limited (you can change your faction). But the mechanics for fighting were terrible, really. Jumpy characters, people lagging on purpose, just meh. It took out the beauty i loved after some time. Dunno if they ever fixed the netcode and pvp mechanics.\n\nThe Summary\nI can't recommend, neither don't recommend this game. Best see for yourself, however be warned: Falling in love after first looks might disappoint a lot later on.

Game that will keep you busy for a very long time with allot of different people from around the world trying to carve their own little place out in the wasteland. Has a couple of bugs now and then but is fixed with a simple relog, and also has a very active update and bug fixing comunity that maintains it. Has a very comlicated HUD but you make it your own. Modular HUD.\n\nAfter more than 1000 hours on this game, I must say it was nice. It does get very frustrating waiting for crafts to finish, and getting all of the materials but in the end its all worth it. A game that will keep you busy for a very very VERY long time and has so much to offer. Looking at the Single Player content such as NPC's that give missions and places to discover on your own, it has more than 1000 hours worth in it. I have not even covered 1/4 of it yet. PvP is somewhat a battle but you get the hang of it, make sure you got a good build for it though. This game is very modular in allot of ways, from HUD layout, to Charachter Build and Look. You are set free in the Wasteland. Group in a clan, gain a faction, make new friend from across the Planet (Seeing that its ONE Global Server) and Survive. So Carve out your own spot to call home in the Wasteland.\n\nAt 1199 Hours in this game I have finally reached the maximum ammount of money that you can have on a single character. 9y99r99b99w. This is through only crafting, trading and selling. Something I am very proud of looking back at now in the game.","June 11, 2013","true","338.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It first gave me the impression of "just another game" but is very far from. It is quest based and leaves you wanting to complete more and more - addictive so to speak and the quests are reasonably challenging for whichever level you are. It has many items to loot and craft, every time you think you've figured it all out and there cannot possibly be any more it surprises you with something new and even more curious than the last.\n\nAnother thing I really like about this game is that you can ask for help at anytime and you will get it. Gamers are friendly and willing to help in chat. It gives a sense of comfort for those who "get lost".","February 23, 2015","true","511.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

I spent plenty of time in game scav'ing for resources, playing in the pvp arena, joining up with clans, and roaming the province. It has a unique and very loveable style even though it was clearly trying to edge its way into the WoW market. When I played it was fresh out of beta, the developers were very close to the community. Even for the year or two I played that didn't change much. But then it just died. I'm not blaming the developers for selling the property to gamers first. You do what you gotta to stay afloat. But the change never took well. The community never talked to each other anymore. The only changes that were ever implimented were to make the microtransactions float and the f2p model more appealing. The content grew stale and dried out and eventually it became akin to the wasteland it portrays. I would not recommend this game to anyone new. Its a dried out husk of a community that once was and there's no chance of it ever coming back.","March 9","false","80.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

First off, this is a free to play, MMORPG with more numerical values in skill points and microtrasactions than are reasonable in an MMO, RPG or not. If you are one of those people who can keep tabs on their progress every 20 seconds great, you 'might' like this game. Secondly, crafting takes the longest it should ever take you. Building a gun in the game takes about as long as a machine might take to calculate the numeric value of pi. I sat waiting for literal days, waiting for crafting items to finish. Third, after finding most of the beginning quests, you struggle to find more, leading you to take hours on the crappy little ATV you spent 5 days (real-time) to make, running strait into a PvP field, dieing instantly from a stray bullet or an overpowered NPC. Last but not least, there is the problem of buttons. I have never played a game where every key on your keyboard + keys you don't even have is/are used in game to perform simple tasks such as turning left.\n\nI don't want this to sound like I'm griping about this game, but its just something where if you can deal with organized chaos you may have a chance to play this game, otherwise, stay clear of this game.","March 29, 2014","false","0.2"," 16 of 29 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","16","29","0","1"

They give us an open world that is just completely empty, the hit boxes are horrid, and the fact that in order to PvP you have to accept duals is kinda stupid for a gaint game such as this. This game just feels like World of Warcraft with a Nuclear Apocalypse skin on it. Someone's review said it was like fallout. That is completely wrong it only looks like Fallout:NV (Gaint, empty, and brown being the main color) I would not download this game as it is a complete waist of time and space on your hardrive. Also one other thing, everthing goes by levels, so instead of going around and being ableto take on things and people because they have a gun and you don't you take things on because one side is mega level 9000 (just an expression) and your not.

It takes a bit to get into, but now that I have gotten to lvl 5 I think I have a decent feel for how it works. Its really an open do as you want thing, the missions at first are very drab feeling, but they teach you how to craft and give you plenty of good starting stuff. Although its a F2P, and does have a shop I have not found anything that is needed to buy. Most of the shop items are just cosmetic. No push to shop for items at all. The community has been really good to play with also.  A dedicated HELP channel is the default for the chat channel and it has decent folks to help, and I have seen a good in game GM presence. One thing that is actually nice is they dont allow the chat to be overrun with garbage either. By that I mean like today,  a guy was talking racist garbage and they shut him down ASAP.\nSO overall, a bit slow to get started with, but well worth the time to try it out.\n\nEDIT:\n\nI have a bit more time in now, so thought I would add here. Its a pretty good game. The community has been great, the GM's are actually there, and I have not found anything in your face about having to buy anything from the store. Its not pushing any Pay 2 Win envelopes on you, and even in the PvP area I have finally felt good enought to go to, it was a good time. So far all the equipment I have seen is just as available to a F2Per as to a buyer. Seems they were smart in making the system so that instead of pay to win, you can pay to get something you may just not want to take the time to craft. No super weapons for the buyers only, no uberness in paying to win. The money is so far balanced also, its called Chips in game, and is based on Poker chips, and its not hard to find or sell stuff be it to merchants or other players and actually get some fair return. I was even amazed to see that the things I could buy at my current level on the AH were actually not some overpriced manipulated economy, I could afford them if I wanted them.\nyep its a good time for a Free Download.","June 24, 2014","true","107.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It has one of the most immersive and well crafted worlds with a real feel of distance and isolation not felt since Star Wars Galaxies. Which actually works out well since 99% of the game (PvP the exception) was designed for the single player experience. The combat system is solid with lots of options.

Plays a lot like Star Wars: Galaxies. The skills and crafting systems seem to be heavy handed at first, but with a little reading, you can grasp the basic concepts fairly quickly.

For free, you get access to pretty much everything.  Really, the only thing extra you that is worth a damn as a paying customer is the extra xp gain.  Leveling is quite tedious and slow.\n\nSo if you don't know anything about FE then here we go:  FE is a post apocalyptic MMORPG developed by Reloaded.  I think the original developers went bankrupt shortly after the release of FE like 6 years ago and Reloaded picked it up.   FE survived for awhile but the player base quickly diminished.  This is due to a few factors.  Rampant hacking in PVP and a poor interface and content supply.  PVP hacking is something I personally have never experienced because I never pvp.  To PVP, you must go to a specified area.  Apparently there are aimbot hacks used there that give hackers an easy 1 shot kill to the head.  Since this is a skill based game which active targeting, you can see why players are angry with this.  The developers have shown to not care at this point and just allow it.\n\nFE is on life support at this point but still a playable game.  People are obviously still pumping the publisher with revenue and some people even have a $30/month subscription.  The combat is FE is very active and somewhat exciting because you have to aim at the head to do maximum damage.  I think full loot PVP would be an even better addition to this but it'll never happen.  The developers barely push out content and i think the last major content update was 3 years ago.  So, the publisher is just milking this game for whatever is left, like a vulture.  Still a good game to waste some time in.\n\nHere is my review from 2015\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qJXFMIyxnk","May 14","true","35.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But it simply just doesn't work at all. All the times I tried to play it, it crashed my computer, even while I was playing on the lowest settings! and to top it all off: these weren't even regular crashes, these were BLUE SCREENS! on WINDOWS 7! I didn't even know these existed on modern systems!\n\n\nDon't play this game, it has ♥♥♥♥ compatibility.\n\nSo, I played the game for a while, it looks sloppy and ugly even on the highest settings, the animations and models look so old and dated. Also the aiming is weird in this game, I'm used to my aim not completely following my crosshair, and instead hitting where the animation plays, which is not how melee works in this game.\n\nSo, if you were to attack something with a melee weapon, it may look like you hit it but you haven't, and same thing in reverse. Speaking of combat, you cannot hit NPCs which are too far away (even though it looks like you do, blood and dust does show, but their health bars do not deplete) I can understand this was done to prevent people doing this to players, but come on. NPCs. Seriously.\n\nIt's also very boring, but I'll have to give credit for making the game semi-straight forward. Still not worth downloading.","March 4, 2014","false","5.0"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","1"

Anyway, It's fun for a free game, you can't be picky in that regard, so I enjoy it. The only downside I've seen, is I haven't really found all that unique loots. It seems you craft most of your stuff and that you usually just get componets from killing stuff. To that regard, there are more than one way to get mats, 1 is just on bodies and then 2 is on various plants and things around the world, also you can your skill up and at certain points skin and harvest harder plants/animals/whatever. So it's not just run around and kill ♥♥♥♥, there are skills and an active improvement based skill set that increases when you do more of stuff close to your skill, increasing it. It's worth a try, the quests seem plentiful and if you have a friend you may be able to pull some harder quests  and creatures earlier on. I started at what seems to be the crafting hub, it seemed the most friendly--farmstead.","February 24, 2012","true","49.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FireKirby/recommended/113420/","FireKirby","Amber Spark","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FireKirby/","15 products in account","Before I start, let me say, yes this game isn't as good as it could be!\n\nBut it could be worse. To start, some of the major flaws are visable from the get go, lack of character slots, you want more then one character, buy slots, this itself is a huge turn off, and makes it seem like a demo for a pay once to play MMO. This honestly detered me from playing, but I decided to press on to see if it got better, and it did.....some what.\nWhile the skill system takes a moment to learn due to it's unfreindly new user interface, it's well designed once you get the hang of how it works.\n\nThe crafting systemis superb, while it is long, and a lot of the crafting times are broken, meaning they take more or less then what it says it will, only those who are really in to crafting will actually make use of this. All crafting skills have purpose, if you seek to play a more support role, medical and cooking skills will be of the most use to you. want a role to inflict maximum damage, science, ballistics and possibly nature (whick could also be put under support) would be a good suit for you.\nYou can buy slots to have the ability to craft multiple items at once, and buy a device to speed up the crafting times all together. What more, the device can be bought from other players in game.\n\nThe ability to create camps, and material generaters gives this mmo a unique feel to it, making it seem more like a sand box game then an mmo. But this is also it's downfall, because it seem it can't decide if it wants to be an MMO or sandbox game, the AI seems unfinished and buggy, audio clips break at times, and enemy AI is flat out broken. But the broken enemy AI may also have been done on purpose, as even something one or two levels higher then you can easily come close to killing you, if you're not swarmed that is. Therefor, it's better to travel out in teams so you're not caught in a fray alone.\nYes this game is Pay to Win, yes it has a lot of bugs and could be considered still in beta, but this game has merit, and tried to do something different.\n\nIf I had to rate this game, I'd give it a 8/10 something worth keeping regaurdless of the playerbase or cons, as this game could be easily fixed.","July 2, 2014","true","44.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I understand what the original devs were going for but tbh its a terrible mmo, the combat is worse than WoW it can only be accuratly described as "hotkey spamming fps" since you still need to aim your weapon and shoot.\n\nThe combat in itself is terrible pve is a waste of time in the long run, endgame is completly pvp and is entirelly p2w since you need to buy items for real cash in order to craft the top tier items.\n\nPVE is broken as hell with bullet sponge bosses and normal mobs at that, i remember a specific type of mob that dropped some mid level loot required an insane amount of time to kill, but was also terribly slow, so you could easily spend 5 mins attempting to kill it before it got even close enough to you to attack.\n\nPVP is completly p2w as stated above, and the community is so terrible that max level players can be regularly seen in early level areas farming players for easy "Deathtoll" which was the pvp currency, that enabled you to craft pvp armor and weapons which though arguably good were still terrible in comparison to p2w gear\n\nThe crafting system is terrible, from what i recall you can queue up to 3 items without a sub or without buying a consumable that enabled you to have a few more slots with real money, but again this consumable only lasted a few hours\n\nCrafting based characters will have a hard time getting to the better resources because most of them are in pvp zones, except one specific resource who is a garanteed drop in a bullet soaking raid boss, but has a 1/100 chance of dropping to you.\n\nI have played this game activelly for a few months and spent nearly a year popping in and out just to check up on a community of friends. Its not worth spending time on, there are plenty of other games out there who are way better than this game.\n\nAs a final verdict i cant even say anything out of 10 cause i dont think its even worth an honorable mention.","July 19, 2012","false","565.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There is also farming, pvp, only in certain spots, but those spots are rich with resources, so there is no griefing the noobs.  Also the community is pretty good and the Help channel actually helps.  To top it off players moderate the chat and I have seen the ban hammer come down more than once.  Yes the interface is clunky, yes the graphics are not AAA, but I love this game and it gives me a sense of accomplishment when I can go out, gather stuff and make myself a shirt.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drapocalypse/recommended/113420/","drapocalypse","Doctor ☢ Apocalypse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drapocalypse/","238 products in account","Fallen Earth, at its time of release, was actually a pretty fun romp. The world and landscape was vast and full of nice locations, as well as keeping an excellent post apocalyptic tone to everything. There was a lot to do, many places to explore, mutants and enemy factions to hunt down and kill, and hundreds of items to craft. In fact over 90% of all in game items where craft-able at the time. It was a ambitious game that didn't quite hit the mark on a lot of things.\n\nWhile it was a pretty game and offered a lot of options as far as what you could do and where you could go, the big headaches of the game ended up dragging it down. For starters it used a skill system that was pretty open ended. Normally i would say "Ah hell yeah, i can really be what i want to be!" Unfortunately that is not the case. It was pretty easy to bork a character and you really had to specialize if you wanted to be remotely effective in anything. The skills you could learn and acquire throughout the game where nothing amazing, there just wasn't any wow factor. It also implemented a quasi magic system, which acted more like a enhancement to a weapon style vs a more caster role. A pure caster is possible, but in game it just wasn't all that effective.\n\nCombat itself was about as boring as it could get. Weapons where just a bore to use. The game offered multiple firearm classes to specialize in as well as melee. The animations and sounds where nothing short of drab. Weapons felt like peashooters, even if it was a higher tier rifle or machine gun, all guns just "felt" like you where shooting a BB gun. Melee was even worse, as the animations and damage indication was sloppy. On top of that, mobs sit around, waiting to be engaged. I'm a little over early MMO troupes, how about you?\n\nHowever, even though i may be a little harsh on its short coming, with a group of friends, this game can be a blast. There are a ton of areas to explore, side missions to cash in on and a mid/late game faction based pvp zone. This is where it can really get interesting. All players have the option of joining a faction, and each faction has some special skills and perks associated with them. Fighting over control towns and resource fields are really fun with the right gang of people.\n\nFallen Earth will not be for everyone. If you can get past the poor combat system and dated MMO style of quests and combat, it is a pretty big game to explore and get sucked into. Its even F2P, so if you like Post Apoc settings and are up for something different and new, give it a shot. It might surprise the hell out of you.","September 27, 2014","true","191.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

To start, some of the major flaws are visable from the get go, lack of character slots, you want more then one character, buy slots, this itself is a huge turn off, and makes it seem like a demo for a pay once to play MMO. This honestly detered me from playing, but I decided to press on to see if it got better, and it did.....some what.\nWhile the skill system takes a moment to learn due to it's unfreindly new user interface, it's well designed once you get the hang of how it works.\n\nThe crafting systemis superb, while it is long, and a lot of the crafting times are broken, meaning they take more or less then what it says it will, only those who are really in to crafting will actually make use of this. All crafting skills have purpose, if you seek to play a more support role, medical and cooking skills will be of the most use to you. want a role to inflict maximum damage, science, ballistics and possibly nature (whick could also be put under support) would be a good suit for you.\nYou can buy slots to have the ability to craft multiple items at once, and buy a device to speed up the crafting times all together. What more, the device can be bought from other players in game.\n\nThe ability to create camps, and material generaters gives this mmo a unique feel to it, making it seem more like a sand box game then an mmo. But this is also it's downfall, because it seem it can't decide if it wants to be an MMO or sandbox game, the AI seems unfinished and buggy, audio clips break at times, and enemy AI is flat out broken. But the broken enemy AI may also have been done on purpose, as even something one or two levels higher then you can easily come close to killing you, if you're not swarmed that is. Therefor, it's better to travel out in teams so you're not caught in a fray alone.\nYes this game is Pay to Win, yes it has a lot of bugs and could be considered still in beta, but this game has merit, and tried to do something different.\n\nIf I had to rate this game, I'd give it a 8/10 something worth keeping regaurdless of the playerbase or cons, as this game could be easily fixed.","July 2, 2014","true","44.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Graphics are meh and the combat system is kinda bad, however the simple fact that I can go into a cave mine some coal kill giant ants and underdwellers to find a secret cavern is just awesome. And th MMO part adds so much immersion to the game, know whats more fun than attacking a bandit camp? Attacking it with a group of people. I normally stray away from games like this but I have been playing this bad boy nonstop. Also notice how most of the bad reviews complain about difficulty or buggyness or complicated gameplay yet they haven't played for more than 10 hours? They say some crap like this game is Pay2win, and its not at all, Sure paying gets you some "new" things faster but you can get most of these things ingame anyway. If you are a realism fan then get this game. Note this game has a big learning curve and difficulty spike.\n\nNow to the problems\nThe enemy AI tends to be ♥♥♥♥♥, Enemy's respawn in 1 minute taking away from immersion, for some reason the damage and health system is bad (No joke dogs do 20 Dmg a bite and attack every seconds or so and I've gotton surrounded by em and killed in seconds as the ♥♥♥♥♥ take bullets to the head) Stay away from junkyward dogs and gurad dogs is my only tip, The scavenging system can be quite stupid sometimes as well.\n\nOver all this game has\n+Great gameplay mechanics\n+Interesting storys and characters\n+Great immersion\n+Addictive micro managing\n+Great trade and communication system\n\nThe middle ground\nGame lacks mercy for new player which can drive people away but not a problem\nand is more made for intense gamers, not bad but not great graphics.\n\nNow the bad\n-Terrible AI\n-Unhelpful NPC's\n-Strange level system\n-Fast enemy respawns\n\nOverall I'd give this game a 8.9/10\n","June 28, 2014","true","44.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

People are People.\n\n\nThis game relies on Skills and Crafting a damn lot, Its tutorial is kinda of empty but the Default Help channel is full of Nice and helpful community members and admins, Asking them would be a great way of getting into the swing of things.\n\nOverall score - 8 (This game is pretty good for the Hardcore Player or the Skilling casual.)\n","June 22, 2014","true","59.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I love how the game wants you to make your own stuff instead of looting or buying items. You need to scavenge for scrap materials and use other scrap to put together weapons, like a painball gun that fires metal balls. It's a really cool idea. There's still bugs that need ironing out from the Steam release but the game is worth a try, even if it doesn't look that great.

Join a faction and fight for the contol of war zones for bonuses or form a lil team to fight tough boss. You're now exhausted. What about farming? Build your own, plant your seeds...\nThis game is under continuous developement, so constantly improving by adding brand new content.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drapocalypse/recommended/113420/","drapocalypse","Doctor ☢ Apocalypse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drapocalypse/","238 products in account","Fallen Earth, at its time of release, was actually a pretty fun romp. The world and landscape was vast and full of nice locations, as well as keeping an excellent post apocalyptic tone to everything. There was a lot to do, many places to explore, mutants and enemy factions to hunt down and kill, and hundreds of items to craft. In fact over 90% of all in game items where craft-able at the time. It was a ambitious game that didn't quite hit the mark on a lot of things.\n\nWhile it was a pretty game and offered a lot of options as far as what you could do and where you could go, the big headaches of the game ended up dragging it down. For starters it used a skill system that was pretty open ended. Normally i would say "Ah hell yeah, i can really be what i want to be!" Unfortunately that is not the case. It was pretty easy to bork a character and you really had to specialize if you wanted to be remotely effective in anything. The skills you could learn and acquire throughout the game where nothing amazing, there just wasn't any wow factor. It also implemented a quasi magic system, which acted more like a enhancement to a weapon style vs a more caster role. A pure caster is possible, but in game it just wasn't all that effective.\n\nCombat itself was about as boring as it could get. Weapons where just a bore to use. The game offered multiple firearm classes to specialize in as well as melee. The animations and sounds where nothing short of drab. Weapons felt like peashooters, even if it was a higher tier rifle or machine gun, all guns just "felt" like you where shooting a BB gun. Melee was even worse, as the animations and damage indication was sloppy. On top of that, mobs sit around, waiting to be engaged. I'm a little over early MMO troupes, how about you?\n\nHowever, even though i may be a little harsh on its short coming, with a group of friends, this game can be a blast. There are a ton of areas to explore, side missions to cash in on and a mid/late game faction based pvp zone. This is where it can really get interesting. All players have the option of joining a faction, and each faction has some special skills and perks associated with them. Fighting over control towns and resource fields are really fun with the right gang of people.\n\nFallen Earth will not be for everyone. If you can get past the poor combat system and dated MMO style of quests and combat, it is a pretty big game to explore and get sucked into. Its even F2P, so if you like Post Apoc settings and are up for something different and new, give it a shot. It might surprise the hell out of you.","September 27, 2014","true","191.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/YouthOfFreedom/recommended/113420/","YouthOfFreedom","+ Youth Of Freedom +","http://steamcommunity.com/id/YouthOfFreedom/","42 products in account","GAMEPLAY : 5/10\n\nOnce you start out the game,you are given to create your own character. The character creation is pretty lacking for the most part because all you do is choose a bunch of preset but it somewhat acceptable for a wasteland ♥♥♥♥♥♥me.\n\nWhen you begin,you are introduced to an area where you can choose to do the tutorial or not.\n\nThere you can choose 3 server you can go each with its own unique places ( can't confirmed this since i just stick to 1 server ).\n\nAs far as the combat goes,it pretty clunky and sometimes it had poor hit detection ( it even worse if you are lagging ).\n\nYou can toggle between first or third person view though i would prefer the third person view cause it was design in that way.\n\nThere is no story as far as i know,i even ignored most of the dialogue because all you do is read a bunch of text and it doesn't sound engaging at all.\n\nThere is a crafting system which you can build your own weapon,armor,items,medikits and other things so all the loots that you gather may come useful. You can harvest different materials and plants mainly for crafting item and quest.\n\nThere is a horse mount that you get in the beginning of the game which make it easier to travel ( there is a stamina & health system for your mount so better take care of it properly though i find this a chore for beginner player ).\n\nThere is a help chat bar system where you can ask any questions and certain people will answer you straight away ( sometimes they will ignore your question ).\n\nYou will encounter many different types of enemy as you venture far into the wasteland.\n\nThings that are bother me is that some obstacle you can't jump even though they are low and you are not allowed to swims even when it is a clean water ( it really break some immersion ).\n\nAs you gain experience points,you will earn AP which you could increase your stats.\n\nBEWARE.....The game has extremely STEEP CONTROLS which i don't like.\n\nGRAPHICS : 6/10\n\nThis game portray very well on how a post-apocalyptic ♥♥♥♥♥♥me should be.\n\nQuality wise....it doesn't look too bad while i have some complaint with the character models looking quite dated for a game that released on 2011 but overall it a great looking game.\n\nThe game feature day/night cycle depending on the server time if i am not mistaken and the empty feeling of an atmosphere somewhat blend in well with the settings and world.\n\nThe ragdoll physic felt stiff and unnatural at the same times.\n\nThe animations is quite bad in my opinion. While the walking animations is ok,the attack animations is repetitive and when you aim,sometimes the gun shoot at somewhere else but the bullet still travel in straight distance and will hit the enemy regardless the position the gun is facing off ( not sure this just apply only me but this is quite troublesome )\n\nAUDIO : 6/10\n\nThe sound effects for the gun is kinda ok though i find the voice acting hilariously bad especially the enemy you facing against.\n\nThe lack of ambience make the world felt boring and not lively.\n\nThere is not much music in-game,only certain places you will hear them. Not much to say about in this section.\n\nLONG-LASTING APPEAL : 5/10\n\nEven though the game provides a huge amount of achievements which is around 650 and the game world is around 1k square kilometres. The game doesn't provde you enough fun to keep you going.\n\nSure there is some PvP mode but with combat that is extremely lackluster i doubt you will find much enjoyment out of it.\n\nAll you do is kill,do quest,earn experience points,level up,allocate your stats,go to the next destination to do other quest.\n\nOf course this is what most typical MMO does but at least some of them have pretty enjoyable combat.\n\nFINAL VERDICT : 5.5/10\n\nTo be honest,the game has an extremely slow start and it required a lot lot lot of patient.\n\nNot to mentioned the game has a very dull combat and boring quest.\n\nIf you did get far though,the game start to be a bit enjoyable.\n\nI gotta give the developer a credit though,they try to make a post-apocalyptic MMO and succeed in some part. This is probably the closest we can get for a Fallout 3 MMO.\n\nI only recommending for those who can appreciate a slow start MMORPG and able to endured some of its major flaws.\n\nHowever if you are looking for a fun and engaging MMO or even a solid post-apocalyptic MMO then this game might not be for you. You will quit this game just in about 2-3 hours. Trust me.\n\nGRADE : E ( Passable )","May 18, 2014","false","6.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

Anyways the game is fun especially with friends since you need backup and pretty much I hadn't spent a penny on anything. All items are mostly crafted especially weapons. Yes the mobs are pretty annoying.. but if you had backup you can clear the way. Best apoc MMO experience I had. Clans have a great way to make new friends as for me I had been in 3 already but my 3rd one is my permanant. The game has actually gave me free stuff like a brand christmas themed Chopper during Decemeber of 2014 and I already have like 4 cool mounts to travel in the wasteland. The world itself is so large there are secrets awaiting for you. And don't be shy to ask others if you need help on missions. Most high lvls tend to go back to the starter sector(Sector 1) to help others or ask question. (Start in Embry, high lvls tend to hang out there so you can ask them questions if you want). PvP isnt that bad but its horrid. Prefer PvE instead. There is no player looting either as it is not ment to be like DayZ, H1Z1, Unturned, etc as its not that kind of genre. 10/10 would play","December 10, 2014","true","614.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There are a total of 55 player levels as of now, im only level 30 so I havent really seen everything, but from what I have experienced, a very enjoyable game.\n\nFor me, the one biggest problem is definitely the client-to-client synchronization. Players may look as if they are in a position, but really they may not be there. You may also see NPCs glide across the screen due to the synchronization being terrible, but it has improved a bit. In the beginning, you start off with an axe, two knives, and three pellet guns (one being an air rifle and the other two being pistols). After about two or three of the beginning missions, you are awarded a horse for basic transportation, but as you progress further into the game, you get other mounts/vehicles. The basic vehicles are: ATVs, Motorcycles, Dune Buggies, and Interceptor Speedsters (basic cars). Each vehicle has many different variations that you can craft.\n\nThe crafting system isnt too complex, but it can be very slow; vehicles can take up to a few days to fully craft from raw materials, but smaller items, such as ammunition, can take a few minutes. If crafting isnt your thing, then there is also an auction house in almost every city; here you can buy player-listed items for how ever much the player lists the item for.\n\nIf youre someone who absolutely has to have good graphics, then you may not be too fond of this game; the graphics are pretty bad, but that shouldnt really be too big of a deal if you dont mind it. There are also limits to free to play players however, but they can easily be negated by purchasing any single item from the game's market place. The only limitations i am aware of are a limit to how many chips you can have (currency), a character limit of only one character and no access to the Global chats, but there may be more. In my opinion, its definitely worth it to go 'freemium' by just buying a really cheap item from the store, or by purchasing the Survivalist Package that is offered by Steam. I believe that the limit to the amount of chips you can have if you are free to play is about 100,000 chips. This would be 10 red chips and each red chip is 10,000 chips. Chips go by: Yellow>Red>Blue>White. Blue is 100 white, Red is 100 Blue and Yellow is 100 Red.\n\nThere is a total of six different sectors in the game (The entire province is huge, roughly 83km by 83km, according to the Wiki) which all have different fast travel locations that you must first travel to via mount/vehicle. The game also encourages palyers to use roadways with vehicles as they provide a 'boost' and significantly increase your speed. There are also six major factions you can choose to be a part of once you reach Sector 2: The Techs, The Enforcers, Travelers, The Lighbearers, The Vistas, and The CHOTA. Each faction provides unique equipment that you cannot use unless you have a certain reputation with the appropriate faction.\n\nAll in all, a very enjoyable game that will last a while if you can dedicate yourself to playing.","January 22, 2014","true","357.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","4"

Luckily, the game ran a scan of my computer and optimized it for my computer and I run at max FPS.  It is Fallout Online which I love.  My issues with the game are that the graphics are not as beautiful as I would like but it is incredible for when it was released back in like 2008.  When I start up the launcher and try to launch it, it will either tell me I cannot connect to internet (which is usually true) or that the server is having an issue, and also, lets not forget, this is a game where you are asked to upgrade but you do not need to, it is a one time request.  However, disregarding the graphics, age, upgrading, and techincal issues, it does everything masterfully.  You can craft and it is not instantly created, making it more realistic, you get a vehicle (horse) from the very beginning so you don't have to walk all over the Grand Canyon.  You get a speed boost when you ride on the main roads, you can roleplay and go killing other players who are in PvP mode.  I recommend it to anyone who loves Fallout and is dying to play it online with people.","January 22, 2014","true","222.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","2"

The music and sounds are decent.\n\nThe controls are easy to familiarize yourself and, like most MMOs, the beginning tutorial is extremely helpful in establishing your bearings in the game world. The learning curve is moderate to challenging, depending on how familiar you are with MMORPGs and their mechanics.\n\nCrafting is a very fun part of this game if you are into that - you can craft almost anything you see in the game world (which beats having to spend your resources on merchants. Within the first 2 hours I already was driving around in my own ATV. The gameplay is pretty good, however, it still remains fairly buggy in many areas. The AI has godlike sensors, able to detect and chase you across the map once you have aggro'd (hostile interaction) them.\n\nGrinding in this game is actually pretty fun considering that the rewards are very reasonable and the variety in missions is very, very good - they aren't 90% fetch or find quests typical of many MMORPGs. Combat can be weird and clunky at times, and hopefully this will be improved, however, it has been a long time and these problems still remain.\n\nIf you can look past these bugs, and enjoy grinding and crafting in the post-apocalyptic setting, then give this game a try.\n\nRecommend.","July 30, 2014","true","4.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It was actually one of the best communities I've seen, and had a lot of promise for the future. When it was released, there wasn't a single popular MMORPG that was not drowning in magic and pretty colors with hotkeys.\n\nThen the genre of not-magic based MMO's that don't use hotkey and are first person took off, and they all superceeded Fallen Earth nearly immediately.

It was actually one of the best communities I've seen, and had a lot of promise for the future. When it was released, there wasn't a single popular MMORPG that was not drowning in magic and pretty colors with hotkeys.\n\nThen the genre of not-magic based MMO's that don't use hotkey and are first person took off, and they all superceeded Fallen Earth nearly immediately.

To clarify, I did not enjoy playing this bad game.\nSo, in summation: It is a bad game and you should play something less bad than Fallen Earth.\nPromises of a massive, open world and amazing, varied loot are all pointless because the frustration that you experience trying to navigate the interface or work the woeful controls will have you ragequitting long before the supposed grand scale of the map is revealed.\n\nThe 'tutorial' is a battery of textwall hints.\nThe combat is clunky (and quite frankly stupid-looking).\nThe story is a garbled, unengaging nonsense festival.\n\nThe... ugh.

But that doesnt stop me of exploring each section in this mmo.  It has the type of feeling of all the fallout series. Even the crafting recipes in this mmo is unbelievable!!! there are so many creation  recipes you can make (armor,mounts,viechles, medicine, construstion, mutagenics, melee weapons, ballistic weapons etc...) the list keeps going on and on like for an eternity. Thats what makes this game awsome! Even the missions go on forever. And building your character has so many choices of what kind of character you want to be. It only takes time and patience of creating your character. Just give this game a chance if you havent played it before or to anyone that have only played it for a couple of hours. Heck, this game is FREE afterall and there are even special events on holidays and give aways. Only thing is that you gota find the special gift boxes during those events. Just dont listen to the negative reviews about this game and just keep on playing. Oh and if you want to be a freeinum player, just buy ONE thing in their marketplace and you get  character limit to 4, chip limit to UNLIMITED, and other free stuff they give to you when you just buy one thing.

The story is sort of simple, you are a clone and stuff happened and then other stuff happened and now you are in the open (after a 20 min tutorial). I'm being for real I didn't know what was going on the entire time. The dialouge is horrendous which becomes a problem since thats how you get both important information and quests.

It is definitely quite a game, and very much worh a look if you are okay with making another account somewhere else. This game does revolve around gathering, so you will find yourself stopping a lot to get things that you may want or need, but it doesn't hinder the game in my opinion, as it doesn't feel like "farming" in the traditional MMO sense, but in a survival sense, since this is about you surviving in this post apocalyptic world. Definitely fun to RP with, I can tell you that. X3","February 26, 2014","true","33.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

That might scare so people off, but for people like me who love that sort of game then you might anna give this a try. I also see alot of peopel complaining of slow download times and game crashes, i never had the game crash on me at all and got this thing done downloaded and playing in under 30 minutes, which for me is fast. Another thing Fallen earth does that i like is the fact you can either be in 3rd person or 1st, i for one enjoy it in first person, but to each there own i guess.","December 25, 2014","true","60.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

With ABP Reloaded, I spent 3 months and four different accounts waiting for a confirmation emal. When I finally DID get an email for one of them, the account was "Inactive for too long! Please create a new account and try again." I waited all day for this game to download, only to have the exact same problem trying to create and log into my account. It asks for a nonexistant username that the signup system doesn't give you the option to create. I thought it was asking for my steam info shortly after the third unsuccessful try, only to get spammed with more "Username or Password invalid" message. If you see people with 1+ hours on this game, it's probably the 1+ hours they spent trying to get to the actual game.

This game does revolve around gathering, so you will find yourself stopping a lot to get things that you may want or need, but it doesn't hinder the game in my opinion, as it doesn't feel like "farming" in the traditional MMO sense, but in a survival sense, since this is about you surviving in this post apocalyptic world.

This game is very interesting with its PvP and mechanics which i enjoy very much and the transportations like horse's, and vehicles are a good feature. The community of Fallen Earth is the best part, everyone doesnt try to kill you they're pretty much friendly unless you kill someone then theyre gunna all go in a all out war with you. If you play PvP and kill someone with a different faction there WILL be consequences like for example, getting more noticed which is a problem since that will lead to death for you.

That might scare so people off, but for people like me who love that sort of game then you might anna give this a try. I also see alot of peopel complaining of slow download times and game crashes, i never had the game crash on me at all and got this thing done downloaded and playing in under 30 minutes, which for me is fast. Another thing Fallen earth does that i like is the fact you can either be in 3rd person or 1st, i for one enjoy it in first person, but to each there own i guess.","December 25, 2014","true","60.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The company who owns it now isn't even the original one because they gave up on it and essential bugs that needed to be addressed never will as the only people who really understood it were fired early in a bid to get what little cash they could.

As you roam the streets and search for other sane denizens of downtown Detroit, you will encounter many vile mutant hobos, street gangs, feral dogs and even the fabled Detroit Lawnmower gang, who truly are a formidable foe. As you fight to keep your sanity in the streets of Detroit you will uncover its darkest secrets. Detroit is a dangerous place, children, remember to pack your gasmask because Detroit's atmosphere is toxic due to the large amount of drug and automobile use. The number one way to survive this harsh enviroment is to do the Detroit shuffle, I know that this might seem to be a difficult task at first but once you've done it, you'll never forget. Detroit truly is a dangerous place. Overall this Detroit simulation is good, it sums up the trials and tribulations of downtown Detroit perfectly. The weapons are a perfect representation of what one will find in the dark corners of Detroit. The only con to this game is that there is not enough Detroit, as one can never have enough Detroit. Overall, this game is good. If you are looking for a good Detroit simulator then this is the game for you.\n\n10/10 -Detroit\nRemember kids; when in trouble, do the Detroit shuffle.\n\n","December 2, 2014","true","3.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Wanna know why? Well.. let's start from the beginning, shall we?\nFirst of all this game is free... that mean that the persons that created it must be nuts to let it be free. Of course, it's free and that means that they must find a way to make money out of it one way or another. And that means P2W. And if we hold for a minute and think it's a good thing. You must get your money out for the effort that you've put into this game. But... to make two separate classes... the poor ones that play for free.... and the rich ones who invest good money just to be better than the rest and of course, to win. Well. With that said... we arrive at the subject that I've wanted to express. To make a game like this one and to ruin the good time of it... that is a crime. Maybe I was in a bad mood. But it takes you like 1 to 2 hours for an effect to dissapear for you to be able to view the ironsight. That is the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ttiest thing that I've encountered in a game in my entire life. And for what? For the *sickness* to dissapear and when it does to tell you that you must pay money for the ironsight? Oh no! NO! This game broke my day. And the rest of them. How can a man / or men could think of such ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. And don't you tell me ,, Well, it didn't pop that I have to pay money for the ironsight'' cause someday a person will introduce that into a game. And when that day comes, you can be sure that I for one will throw that game out of the window.\nPassing on... the rest of the game is ok. It has first person view, and that is a good thing for a F2P. The gameplay is very entertaining, I'll give it that.\nDon't believe me?\nJUST PLAY IT AND FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF!","April 11, 2015","false","1.7"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","6","12","3","0"

For a Free to Play game it's quite easy to advance without buying ♥♥♥♥, infact, I got myself an ATV, full set of decent armor, 2 pistols, ammo and pleanty of weapons, I even went on raids with some friends I met through a clan. Just thinking about all this makes me feel kind of sad, sad that I haven't played it in ages, and those firends have left, never to be seen again. The gameplay is pretty grindy, but advancing and getting better gear is very rewarding and the game world is ♥♥♥♥ING HUGE HOLY ♥♥♥♥, I once set out on my horse, travelled the lands for abut 3 hours straight, I ended up in some huge rusty old town, I have no clue if I will ever find the town I first set out in ever again.

But overall, if you aren't dumb, you wont have too many issues figuring out things.\n\nThis game is F2P, but if you want to further progress it's good to buy a Survival Premium. Everything is pretty much free, but certain content and items are only for people with Premiums. I wouldn't buy premium without spending a few hours doing quests and leveling, because after level 25 it takes alot of grinding to level. It's also advised to have a plan with your mutations(perks), as you only have a limited amount, and can become costly when you want to revert them at a higher level.\n\nAnyways, about the game.\n\nThe mechanics are simple. Point and shoot. Reload. Laggout. Relog. Shoot some more. Level.\n\nFallen Earth is like a Fallout MMO, though, I don't want to compare it to that, but it's pretty darn near close to what it is. If a hybrid Stalker met Fallout 3, you'd get a cultured, mixed baby called Fallen Earth.\n\nThe games very simple, no assisted aim, pretty much like Fallout without VATS. And the occasional being-in-the-middle-of nowhere and someone sneaks up on you, it can be funny.\n\nCrafting system in the game is also really good. I've crafted all of my stuff and I've spent many long nights just crafting ammo and other weapon parts. Doing node(where you get materials to build stuff) runs, grinding and repeating.\n\nThe games dynamics are pretty much the same, so its not going to be challenging when you go up against some COG compared to a boss.\n\nThere are different roles you can play, you can sit back and be the sniper, or rush up and deal heavy damage, or simply be the tank.\n\nThe game is very socially intense, as some missions require you to find players at a higher level to help you with certain quests. Though you can lone wolf it, and go on by yourself.\n\nI would recommend this game to people who enjoy Fallout type games, and if you have some time to kill with some friends. It's really fun to get into, I would have to say if you want to try a free MMO, give this a shot. It may not have a concrete storyline, but it's a really easy and decent game to pick-up on.","May 14, 2015","true","81.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's sort of like a Fallout game went MMO and had some anarchy online spilled all over it. While this game is far past its prime for "New Content" the folks running the game are active, social, and quick to mute you for being an idiot in Help Chat. Currently it's being supported by an in game marketplace were you can buy mostly just social stuff, and an optional sub for enhanced perks like most of those free to play games out there. And while questing and developing your character and gear is the best part of the game, the end-game is a bit lack luster with very limited options on what to do outside PvP. The only issue I have with the game isn't even the game itself its the PvP community, most are pretty vile and quick to spit at you a mess of stuff you'd expect to hear from a 12 year old playing call of duty.","June 30, 2015","true","776.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The devs are completely out of touch with what direction they should take this game. Crafting is more or less useless, which makes gathering useless which in turn makes 50% of the game meaningless. PvP is hard to get into. It's geared to favor those who have been playing for a long time rather than skill. PvM is buggy, enemies can melee you from a distance, kinda reminds me of SWG in that reguard.\n\nThis is one of those games that could have been really great. But its also one of those games where the devs listened to a fraction of the player base and now you have a bad game with hardly any players. Those players who are active consider themselves elite.\n\nThe devs have promised so much in the past, such as housing, better more meaningful crafting and gathering, BALANCED PvP. and over the years only minor bug fixes are what they give.\n\nI cant recommend this game as it is. It almost like its in constant beta. Such a shame.","April 4, 2015","false","2.1"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","8","16","0","0"

The graphics are good,, though not amazing, the crafting system is one of teh best I've seen in an MMO that is not Eve Online, it does the whole real time crafting thing real well. The community has always been pretty toxic when you step into the PvP aspects oft eh game but that is to be expected as some people have grudges with others that span years now or they simply hate a faction regardless of who is on it (there are 6 total factions though now a days they do not matter due to low player count in game and removal of faction based bonuses, the only advantage now is the armor cosmetics and which faction chat your can talk in). The PvE community however is prettygood and open to help people.\n\nNow the bad. G1G (the company that bought FE from Icarus Studios) have been doing the minimal to keep the game ticking over and making money. The game was meant to be spread over 9 total zones and having an in depth and intriguing plot and story line. When G1G bought the game I belive 4 of the zones where done (don't get me wrong the zones in this game are HUGE and pretty well detailed). Now since 2012 to now, only 1 of the new zones has been added and it's one totally thought up by G1G and has practically zero addition to game play. It is effectively a mix of 2 zones or 2 parts of 2 zones I should say, saying that it does look good, it just has no body or soul, it's just that, looks and some newarea to grind in to get a new tier of gear. It's nice however it took over a year to finish and just looks like a rehash.\n\nNow another thing that is a MAJOR killer in this game is MASSIVE CONSTANT LAG. I'm not kidding when I say if your playing early morning in the US or late at night in the US, you will have in game lag whenever you go to loot a body (1-10 seconds to loot where normally it's instant) or if you gather a resource node. It also happens in the chat with 1-5 second lag between hitting enter and the post appearing, if it appears at all (I've had messages just go into the ether and no, not muted or anything, just parts of a convo just never get delivered). These problems result in G1G having to restart the servers at least once a day where they have to take them down for up to 90 minutes, sometimes longer, just so the game doesnt crash.\n\nNow saying all that I must say give the game a shot, it is a good game and the latency issues are newish...well month or two of it happening every day, butif you love post apoc games and just want to drive around mad max style in a car or beaten up dune buggy with a 50 cal on the roof, this is the game for you. It just sucks how most people don't give it a good run past level 20 as at 40+ (level 55 is max level currently) is where it starts to open up and give you freedom to do whateer you want.","January 29, 2015","true","243.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

That's where I first gave up looking at the recipes taking 1-2days in real life with subscription boosts to craft.\n\nIt's more so a game you play when you had enough of Fallout 3 and moved on to Fallout New Vegas ~ then had enough of Fallout New Vegas for the moment [mods and the DLC will keep you busy for hours] ~ then you move on to Fallen Earth giving that a couple of hours  ~Then back to Fallout New Vegas or Fallout 4 [steam sale going at the time of this post]\n\nNote:\nNo new content ~ Generally quiet ~ but the servers are still up so you can always pop in and check if you finally crafted your component ~ then craft the next 2 day wait component\nI have clocked about 110+ hours over the last 2 weeks ~ maybe 3 of them was actual game play the rest was waiting in craft [Not kidding] or travelling to a new lifenet pod city to get more recipes~ I've increased my Cooking level both in game and in real life during this time","December 27, 2015","true","323.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/the_cableguy/recommended/113420/","the_cableguy","Tchubacca","http://steamcommunity.com/id/the_cableguy/","12 products in account","It's addicting to play, I like the whole idea of building things to use in the game.  I'm going to list the Cons first:\n\nCons:\n-Graphics are pretty basic, but the game it free\n-There are about a billion quests and you can only have so many on the active page so you can spend a lot of time wandering around doing quests and not realize you had two others you could have done while you were there.  Now you have to go back where you just were to do those.\n-If you follow along the recommended quest lines, and skip the others in order to level up, you will be in over your head quickly.  Not to mention some of the quest lines are 25 minute rides on a horse between them.\n-This can be a good thing or a bad thing, stands out bad to me, but respawns of enemies/creatures is WAY too fast.  I understand that if there are a lot of people playing the same area with the same quests, you need to have respawns set faster in order for people not waiting so much, but this game has been out for a while and it's very rare to be questing near anyone else.  If you are involved in clearing an area out and meet the boss, you retreat a little to reload/heal whatever and you will run into all the people you just killed and die in a horde.  They really need to make some of the bigger quest jobs into their own instance without enemy/creature respawn.  The game uses instances for some quests, they just need to do it more often, like the PRISON!!\n\nPros:\n-I find people are very helpful in help chat.  I have seen the same question come up in less than 10 minutes from three different people and someone is willing to answer it all three times without being a smartass.\n-Lots of higher level players give things out to lower levels players which helps a lot in the leveling process.  I got 50R from someone early in the game and can buy anything I want now at my level and I have a ton left over.  Thanks dude!\n-It's fun gameplay,\n\nAs a final note, you can do surveys on the Fallen Earth website (not really, they redirect you to a company that handles it).  These surveys can drive you insane.  You can choose to do a 15 minute survey for a certain amount of points and then do 10 minutes of a "pre" survey to determine that you are not a match for the "real" survey and receive nothing.  That needs to be fixed.  I think when I initially started doing surveys for points, I spent two hours doing them, selected about 15 different surveys and only received credit for doing two.  Not worth my time.  You should at least get something for doing the "pre" surveys even if you arent a match for the real one.\n\nAnyways, fun game, kinda basic, surveys can be PITA.","December 13, 2015","true","60.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MewtwoandMew/recommended/113420/","MewtwoandMew","Nick Wilde","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MewtwoandMew/","75 products in account","This game is quite wonderful if you didn't play fallout new vegas before it, many people who don't like Fallen Earth claim thats their reasoning, and I can agree, when I first played Fallout: New Vegas, I drew many comparrisons towards Fallen Earth, and its entirely based on their core gameplay styles, rather than mechanics. But this game is more balanced towards PvE, unlike fallout, you actually have true crafting and scavenging that doesn't just give you what your looking for, you have to make it, or learn it, unless you have friends in high places, such is the true life of a survivor in an apocolypse. This game also offers a nice explaination for one of gamings biggest mysteries, respawning. You have a collar, which transfers your DNA into a chamber, reconstructs you atom by atom, and gives you a "new life" as a clone of yourself, something I wish was in other games rather than "you died, restart" the game is vastley large, I could easily see Skyrim's map fitting within all the sectors, possibly more than once, and weapons are vast in the beginning, as you get stronger, weapons tend to become more scarce, with good reason, so you rely much more on your skills than an overpowered Bumper Sword, and with the character menus, such as Abilities and Stats, your options are endless in what type of character, or "toon" you'd like to create, vs. Bethesda's way of "upgrade it all over time" your more limited, but in a good way, and you have the ability to reset all your stats and start over to specifically fit how you play, along with the adition of mounts, which start off bad, give you 7 types of vehicles to choose from, Horse, ATV, Motorcycle, Dune Buggy, Chopper, Station wagon, and Sports car, they also have different types of each, an example would be "dune buggy" vs. "cargo buggy" or "chopper" vs. "Tribal Chopper" they have different stats, and each vehicle handles certain terrain better than others, as well as the ability to have more than one vehicle. The crafting is intuitive and very thourough, with real time crafting that takes time to make more complex items so you can't just spit out the best of something like a machinegun with the right tradeskill componants, it gives you a greater sense of acomplishment by knowing you built something that took hours rather than buying it from the Auction House, though as I said before, with friends in high places, anything is possible, I suggest craft early on as much as you can, ask the Help Channel for any information, for myself and others often know detailed answers on how to complete a task or quest, or locate specific items. The Wiki can be useful too, utilizing tools given to the player and figuring out your best way to play is the greatest part of the journey, to see all the pieces fall together:... IN SHORT: This game is for DEDICATED PLAYERS, those who will take the time to do these things listed, and many more unlisted tasks, some amazing, some time crunching, to acomplish your higher, longterm goals. I recommend this game to those looking for something to pour their hours into and want something that keeps giving them different challanges to overcome, AS FOR THE CASUAL PLAYER, I suggest giving it a try and seeing how you enjoy it, but not taking it to heart that it will be like fallout or anything that simple, its a rough game, for rough players, and if you don't like it, you can simply move on to another game, though I must warn you, I've found few MMORPGs as interesting as this one, only POTCO could hold my attention longer than this, and that may have been because of its simplisity and fun nature towards its gamers. With that being said... Enjoy the Apocolypse.","December 22, 2015","true","584.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Personally, I didn't think there'd be any real story to the game, so yeah...  I pretty got what I expected out of it.\n\nI'm the kind of idiot that loves to craft, craft, craft and make stuff for no reason whatsoever, so that aspect of the game was very appealing - even now.\n\nLiquor, Guns, and Ballbats?  Another plus on the list ^_^\n\nPlayer community:  I feel like I've been playing with a whole city of hermits - they're active on the chat enough, but when it comes to trying to do anything as a group, it's almost like nobody really exists (that or I'm getting ignored).\n\nGraphics and Technical Schtuff: It's dated... It really is.  I personally don't mind old and clunky graphics (Grew up on the C64), but how the game likes to eat up three times the required resources isn't something that sits well with me...  However, I have not ran into any crashes or freezes.  I did run into some performance degradation, though.\n\nContent and Other Stuff: Truth be told, I would have no issues supporting the developers VIA that micro shop if that would get the game some updates or SOMETHING.  For the love of Christ, don't do the Blizzard thing that try to panic-update every three years!  Just a little bit every now and then would be nice (so as long as it doesn't make the computer dead).\n\nNo, this game is not Fallout (Anyway, do we really WANT a Fallout Online after what Bethesda did with Elder Scrolls Online?) or will never be anything close to it.  However, taking it for what it is, I still enjoy it.  Guilty pleasure?  Unsure...\n\nI give this game a 3 out of 5.","March 14","true","117.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Wanna know why? Well.. let's start from the beginning, shall we?\nFirst of all this game is free... that mean that the persons that created it must be nuts to let it be free. Of course, it's free and that means that they must find a way to make money out of it one way or another. And that means P2W. And if we hold for a minute and think it's a good thing. You must get your money out for the effort that you've put into this game. But... to make two separate classes... the poor ones that play for free.... and the rich ones who invest good money just to be better than the rest and of course, to win. Well. With that said... we arrive at the subject that I've wanted to express. To make a game like this one and to ruin the good time of it... that is a crime. Maybe I was in a bad mood. But it takes you like 1 to 2 hours for an effect to dissapear for you to be able to view the ironsight. That is the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ttiest thing that I've encountered in a game in my entire life. And for what? For the *sickness* to dissapear and when it does to tell you that you must pay money for the ironsight? Oh no! NO! This game broke my day. And the rest of them. How can a man / or men could think of such ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. And don't you tell me ,, Well, it didn't pop that I have to pay money for the ironsight'' cause someday a person will introduce that into a game. And when that day comes, you can be sure that I for one will throw that game out of the window.\nPassing on... the rest of the game is ok. It has first person view, and that is a good thing for a F2P. The gameplay is very entertaining, I'll give it that.\nDon't believe me?\nJUST PLAY IT AND FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF!","April 11, 2015","false","1.7"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","6","12","3","0"

I dunno, I had red chips in the mail and some on hand, but couldn't collect them. It's been a while since I played, so I don't remember everything, but I think I had to get premium to hold more or something like that.\n\nIt's not all that bad, though. It's good for an apocolypse game that comes with good ideas for character builds and such. I like that you can craft pretty much everything you need, but some materials are extremely hard to get, and as I said beore, the crafting times are crazy.\nFE is basically an apocolyptic World of Warcraft. Obviously not as big, popular, or 'fixed'.\n7/10 in my opinion to say the least.","July 14, 2015","true","2.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Personally, I didn't think there'd be any real story to the game, so yeah...  I pretty got what I expected out of it.\n\nI'm the kind of idiot that loves to craft, craft, craft and make stuff for no reason whatsoever, so that aspect of the game was very appealing - even now.\n\nLiquor, Guns, and Ballbats?  Another plus on the list ^_^\n\nPlayer community:  I feel like I've been playing with a whole city of hermits - they're active on the chat enough, but when it comes to trying to do anything as a group, it's almost like nobody really exists (that or I'm getting ignored).\n\nGraphics and Technical Schtuff: It's dated... It really is.  I personally don't mind old and clunky graphics (Grew up on the C64), but how the game likes to eat up three times the required resources isn't something that sits well with me...  However, I have not ran into any crashes or freezes.  I did run into some performance degradation, though.\n\nContent and Other Stuff: Truth be told, I would have no issues supporting the developers VIA that micro shop if that would get the game some updates or SOMETHING.  For the love of Christ, don't do the Blizzard thing that try to panic-update every three years!  Just a little bit every now and then would be nice (so as long as it doesn't make the computer dead).\n\nNo, this game is not Fallout (Anyway, do we really WANT a Fallout Online after what Bethesda did with Elder Scrolls Online?) or will never be anything close to it.  However, taking it for what it is, I still enjoy it.  Guilty pleasure?  Unsure...\n\nI give this game a 3 out of 5.","March 14","true","117.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The ones you enconter in the first town are quite weack but every town you go to the npcs are stronger and cooler, so i advise you to craft the best armor and weapons possible in every town you go.\nOver all it's a really fun game and will entertain you until you get bored of it and find a new one.

But this game is more balanced towards PvE, unlike fallout, you actually have true crafting and scavenging that doesn't just give you what your looking for, you have to make it, or learn it, unless you have friends in high places, such is the true life of a survivor in an apocolypse. This game also offers a nice explaination for one of gamings biggest mysteries, respawning. You have a collar, which transfers your DNA into a chamber, reconstructs you atom by atom, and gives you a "new life" as a clone of yourself, something I wish was in other games rather than "you died, restart" the game is vastley large, I could easily see Skyrim's map fitting within all the sectors, possibly more than once, and weapons are vast in the beginning, as you get stronger, weapons tend to become more scarce, with good reason, so you rely much more on your skills than an overpowered Bumper Sword, and with the character menus, such as Abilities and Stats, your options are endless in what type of character, or "toon" you'd like to create, vs. Bethesda's way of "upgrade it all over time" your more limited, but in a good way, and you have the ability to reset all your stats and start over to specifically fit how you play, along with the adition of mounts, which start off bad, give you 7 types of vehicles to choose from, Horse, ATV, Motorcycle, Dune Buggy, Chopper, Station wagon, and Sports car, they also have different types of each, an example would be "dune buggy" vs. "cargo buggy" or "chopper" vs. "Tribal Chopper" they have different stats, and each vehicle handles certain terrain better than others, as well as the ability to have more than one vehicle. The crafting is intuitive and very thourough, with real time crafting that takes time to make more complex items so you can't just spit out the best of something like a machinegun with the right tradeskill componants, it gives you a greater sense of acomplishment by knowing you built something that took hours rather than buying it from the Auction House, though as I said before, with friends in high places, anything is possible, I suggest craft early on as much as you can, ask the Help Channel for any information, for myself and others often know detailed answers on how to complete a task or quest, or locate specific items. The Wiki can be useful too, utilizing tools given to the player and figuring out your best way to play is the greatest part of the journey, to see all the pieces fall together:... IN SHORT: This game is for DEDICATED PLAYERS, those who will take the time to do these things listed, and many more unlisted tasks, some amazing, some time crunching, to acomplish your higher, longterm goals. I recommend this game to those looking for something to pour their hours into and want something that keeps giving them different challanges to overcome, AS FOR THE CASUAL PLAYER, I suggest giving it a try and seeing how you enjoy it, but not taking it to heart that it will be like fallout or anything that simple, its a rough game, for rough players, and if you don't like it, you can simply move on to another game, though I must warn you, I've found few MMORPGs as interesting as this one, only POTCO could hold my attention longer than this, and that may have been because of its simplisity and fun nature towards its gamers. With that being said... Enjoy the Apocolypse.","December 22, 2015","true","584.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You basicly go around doing missions from npcs and craft weapons, armor, vichles, etc. Theres alot of wierd creatures in the world that you can kill and harvest after, moast of them are mutants or npc bandits.\nDon't wory about getting killed and losing your stuff because moast of the map is pve, but you still have to whatch out for  agressive npcs. The ones you enconter in the first town are quite weack but every town you go to the npcs are stronger and cooler, so i advise you to craft the best armor and weapons possible in every town you go.\nOver all it's a really fun game and will entertain you until you get bored of it and find a new one.

Devs don't give enough attention to it though in the areas that it needs large amounts of improvement. My main complaint isn't the fighting physics (while they aren't very good, being that you select a monster/person and just let your character hit them over and over again on their own, think world of warcraft in a free2play game) but instead the hook to come back and play more. I just simply couldn't get immersed in the gameplay, it lacked a good storyline, and instead gave out shi tty quests as a way to waste your time. Upgrades are disgustingly expensive, leveling up takes forever, and pvp isn't even under discussion. Plain and simple, imho, its a bad game.

No ax swings, swooshes, GAAAHHH, nothing. So after this, I shrug it off as a small glitch that's in every f2p. I get to the point where you aquire the sniper where thereis again no sound; this annoys me so i decide to exit and search online for a fix (It was simple) so i relaunch it ( did i fail to mention each launch took about 4-5 minutes?) and rejoin where my progress last took place (one pro i found). There was sound, scratchy but there. I start the "kill the sniper" objective only to find I once again have no sound. Oh but it dosent end there; I have a 40 degree pov, couldn't move (almost like i was stuck in the floor or wall) and couldn't see the snipers.

I downloaded the 5.4GB from Steam in about 30-40mins yesterday, but then before I could actually play the game it apparently had to update. No problem I thought as it is just a 130MB update. However it said it was going to take 11 hours to download the 130MB update, when it should take less than 1min! I gave up after an hour and assumed it was a problem that would be resolved the following day. It is slightly faster, my wait time is down to 3 hours now, but that is 3 hours too long for me. By the time this update finishes they will have released another one.\n\nFrankly the game doesn't look like it is worth the hassle or the wait, not to mention the fact that poor servers don't bode well for an online game. I am going to get my 5.4GB (plus the 25MB update) back. I'd advise that you avoid this game and don't waste your time or your hard drive space.","October 21, 2014","false","1.1"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","0"

The fact that you craft whilst you fight, hunt, mine, ride makes no sense at all.

I strongly suspect that the owners (who, I believe, are not the original developers) are in "Maintenance Mode", milking the game until players tire of it, but not adding any improvements or fixing any but the most serious of issues. Just on this basis alone, it is hard to justify sinking any money into it, which means you will be stuck with the sub-standard F2P experience.\n\nEven if the bugs were fixed, though, the game utterly fails at narration: none of the characters are memorable. The missions, though ostensibly varied by their flavor text, ultimately feel very samey. How many times was I told to "defend your location"? In one of the last missions I did, I had to go deep, deep into a prison to kill a boss. It was hard to find him, and at one point I had to traverse a corridor almost literally packed with enemies, who stood there blankly while I murdered their comrades 4 meters in front of them. I finally got to the boss, the culmination of all the mission stories in the zone. There was no dialogue or confrontation; he just attacked me, and what ensured was a long, long fight (due to his massive amount of health) where I tried to cut him to pieces with my knives, while he shot me in the face with a pistol. It's too bad, because his story was kind of interesting. (He was cloning himself, and apparently one of his clones decided to lead the resistance against him.)\n\nCombat is tedious, and (for my melee build) mostly consisted of holding down both mouse buttons while aiming the reticule at an enemy. This is made difficult mostly by the camera, enemies' poor pathfinding -- which frequently causes them to run around unnaturally before they home in on you -- and the facts that the game occasionally ignores your keystrokes and gives little or late feedback when it does detect your keystrokes.\n\nThere are good things about this game -- otherwise I wouldn't have spent as much time with it as I did -- but I'm not motivated to list them here, because mostly what I feel about it now is frustration.","August 29, 2015","false","55.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

(Most players think this is stupid and QQ about it, This MMO RPG is not for you then.)\n\nPvP is Unfair? Doubtful, you just need to know how to create a proper PvP build not just slap your AP points in whatever you think is best, they do make Fallen Earth Character Planners which you can access online by just punching it into google search.\nThe thing with PvP is most players now are experinced Veterens playing, making it more challenging for newer players that hit higher levels to PvP, which is where Clans come into Play. Once you find a clan It's not so hard learning the ropes of PvP, however it is still a steep learning Curve.\n\nEverythings to Expensive. Well heres the thing about that. It's the Apocalypse, Nothings going to be cheap especially not Vehicles, your lucky to even aquire one, most players think this is stupid However it's not. It's challenging just the way a game like this was Met to be.\n\nStaff are useless GM's are bad? Doubtful, out of the few thousand players that play Fallen Earth theres only a Few GM's online so you need to stop and think you have other players PMing them at once to, they can't drop everything just to Help you. Your no Special then everyone else, The GMs/Staff are very Helpful once they actually get around to Responding to you, If you think there's only 2 or sometimes 3 GM's on at a time. A few Thousand Players.. Don't have high hopes of getting a responce. Your better off Submiting a Support Ticket @ Gamersfirst.com rather then comming here and QQing about it because you think your special.\n\nNow my Plus's about the game:\n\nThe game engine may be old but no one has yet to make a better MMO RPG, most game reviewers look at a game by graphics and gameplay, If it has bad graphics it automically get's a bad Review just because. That's now a game Reviewer at all but more of a Person that has to diss a game because it's not to there likings and specifications, It's probably better then what you could ever create to, so my question. What gives you the right to judge a game by graphics when you probably don't know a thing about game creating and how much effort and time and hours go into it? You don't. Peroid.\n\nThe game is hardly buggy at all. Theres the occasional the ground is invisible but that's a 3% chance of happening to you and even so it's an easy fix, Disable Post FX/Adv Post FX and it's fixxed, re enable it next game launch and it's fixxed.\nAgain it's an old game engine and it's very good considering how much detaiil is in each area, even players with Windows XP can play it without an issue.\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone that likes challenging and fun MMO RPGs. Then this game is for YOU.\n\nOverall this is a one of a kind game and everything about it is truly Unique.\n\n9/10\n","February 22, 2015","true","36.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Usually when I think of post-apocalpytic games I think of a generic zombie shooter, so when I went into Fallen Earth, I was surprised (Granted there is a part of the main story where they kind of have zombies). Fallen Earth is a open world MMORPGFPS. It's alittle more hardpressed towards the survival aspect then the shooting aspect. Crafting is a big thing in Fallen Earth and is probably one of the funnest thing to do. Almost everything you can get, can be crafted. From weapons, armor, and even your ammo. Sure you can buy most of your items from the auction house, but there's a certain feeling of just crafting it yourself that is so amazing in the atomsphere that Fallen Earth has created. The combat is a twist between a FPS and a TPS. You can shoot in a third person camera view but I perfer playing in a first person view, Although it feels just a tad bit off and could use some work  it's generally pretty good. Although not the most innovating or new, that's not really what Fallen Earth is about. In my opinion Fallen Earth is about the grander feeling of the atompshere of a Post-Apocalyptic world. Not saying anything about it being a hardcore role playing game but if you can get past the generic combat, it is quite an intriguing game. Theres plenty to do, and even from a story perspective, with all of the side quests and even the main quest is kind of interesting, it caters to a wide audience. If you're looking for an openworld MMO that focuses on elements other than combat, than look no further.","December 15, 2013","true","79.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The crafting is definitely challenging and satisifying when you finally find the ingredients you need to create that new firearm or item. Unlike other denizens, who venture out the wastes by car, timid and calm; I prefer to wander the wastes by horseback, with my trusty Black Steed, shirtless and wild, with warpaint on my face, firearm in hand. The PVP, they say, has fallen since its glory days; but you can still catch a decent fight with people you meet in the wastes. Just keep in mind it is not really a PVP game. It is more based in exploration and crafting. All in all, I would definintely recommend this game if you are in to Post-Apocalyptic games like Fallout.","June 13, 2015","true","226.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
