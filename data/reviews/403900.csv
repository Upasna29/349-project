It won't give you many options and can be pretty much the same through the entire game.

I think this game is worth the price when it's on sale. I got it for $0.14, and I'm enjoying the game. The music is repetitive, the controls are lackluster, and most importantly, there's NO tutorial or backstory. However, it's addictive, introduces cool powerups along the way, it looks nice for a cheap quickly-made game, and it's fun to play when you get bored.\n\nIf this game had a backstory, better controls, and better hitboxes, I'd say it'd be easily worth $5.00.

I've played the mobile version (which is free) and this game is exactly the same save the keyboard controls. I feel really cheated by the makers of the game for taking a free game and selling on steam for money. It's a huge offence. On the bright side side, the keyboard controls do amplify the game and make it far less annoying to play. Except for the fact that you still throw bombs in the direction you walk. This game needs a lot of things, a better menu, that's made for pc and you can scroll through using your arrow keys since you don't use the mouse in the game. Also, the controls aren't great. The music gets repetitive and the sound effects clash with it. The graphics are sub-par since it was taken directly from the mobile version. Controller support would be nice, along with maybe using WASD controls and the mouse to aim and fire as to improve controls. The gameplay isn't bad and is worth your 16 cents sale price, but the game does have problems that make it not worth the full price. This game needs a major update before it's worth full price, but I'm recommending it since the sale lasts for quite awhile :D","November 21, 2015","true","6.0"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"
