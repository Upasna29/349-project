Can you even be offended at that? The game does use polygonal graphics and what appears to be vertex lighting, but I think most integrated graphics chips can handle this amount of detail. Don't quote me on that one. Most systems out there can run this game no problem... If they are Windows systems.\n\nMaybe the friend requirement? Flipping through the manual yourself still provides an interesting experience. The entire game can be beaten with one person or with the participation of 20 or more people. How many games are like that?\n\nLack of voice chat feature? The game has full Steam support, making this a non-issue.\n\nLack of netcode? The design of the game makes this irrelevant. You don't even need an internet connection, but to initially download the game.\n\nFrustration? You can pick up or close the game at any time. Learning to play it without griping at others or being discouraged is probably good for your social health. It's far less frustrating or "cheap" than many modern games, too: bounding boxes in Dark Souls 2, spawns in flanking in Call of Duty, unreasonable level design in Hotline Miami 2. Bombs are self-contained puzzles and you lose only seconds if you make a mistake, not hours of effort. In fact, the more level-headed you are, the better you will be at the game.\n\nBrevity? This one I could see, but the main collection of bombs is only to introduce the mechanics and give some gimmicky setups in the first place. Once you complete it, you can free play whenever you want, as the design calls for well over 11^11 (that's about 2.9 * 10^11) variations. It's unlikely you will ever play the same bomb twice if your objective is variation.\n\nCost? It's $15 right now; if you go in with friends it's a drop in the bucket. I don't feel too bad about the development:cost differential, but I suppose that's up to personal preference.\n\nKeep Talking and Nobody explodes is an accessible, inexpensive, tightly designed game. Even if you're never played a party game or don't care for them, this one is a glimmering example. After hours of consideration, the only problem I can think of is that it seems to be Windows-only at the moment. Do you have Windows and some fraction of $15? Do you like fun games that reward skill, intelligence, and cooperation? If you said yes, it's time to buy.","October 29, 2015","true","5.5"," 403 of 422 people (95%) found this review helpful 38 people found this review funny","95","403","422","38","11"

It will certainly test your friendship or marriage, lol. At first glance, I questioned if there was enough game here to merit the pricetag, but oh boy is there. There are tons of levels, and even a puzzle generator where you can alter various puzzle dynamics. The levels increase in difficulty nicely.\n\nThere is a manual that you print out, and you are free to study it as much as you want. One person works with the bomb - they are the only ones that are allowed to see the screen. The other person(s) is using the manual as a tool to help you solve the puzzles on the bomb. It is helpful to play with more than two people - we had an extra person and you could divvy out puzzles to save time. The average time they give you to solve a bomb is 5 minutes.\n\nPros:\n+Awesome fresh take on a co-op puzzle game\n+Puzzles are really well done - it would take a long time to 'memorize' the manual or be an expert at this game\n+Lots of room for future DLC (ie. a new manual version, game modes, etc.)\n+Controls are minimal and work well\n\nCons:\n-I am not certain that you could complete every bomb with just two people\n-I prefer this in short bursts rather than long play sessions\n-People seem to have strong opinions on which role they like playing - for example, I literally refuse to be the expert with the manual. Thankfully my friends want that role, and they refuse to run the computer. That could be a factor.\n\nTotally worth the money - I will certainly be toying with this for a long time.","October 11, 2015","true","4.1"," 111 of 119 people (93%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","93","111","119","12","3"

You must disarm the bomb before the timer on said bomb runs out. How ever, you have no manual. In comes the co-op mechanic as your friends have a manual that they can use to instruct you on how to disarm the bomb. This is a game where your friendships will either solidify, or very likely yourself, blow up to pieces.\n\nThe bomb you're given has modules which take the form of various puzzles that you must solve and complete in order to disarm the bomb. You can have up to eleven modules in total that range in difficulty. You will have to trust your partners to decipher the information you're giving them. They must be able to use that information and read what the manual instructs before finally giving you the instructions you need to disarm the bomb before it disarms you.\n\nTo conclude, this is an incredibly fun game. Co-Op done absolutely right. It also comes with Oculus Rift support. Pick this game up, you will not be disappointed. If you don't want to disarm the bomb but love giving instructions, the manual is absolutely free to use via the link below.\n\nBomb Manual.

Pretty innovative, yet a natural fit for its genre.  Also, you only need one copy of the game for as many players as you want, which gives it great value.\n\nGameplay: 38/40\nThe game doesn't waste any time getting to the action.  The game feels tense right from the first bomb, even if you end up with plenty of time left.  The defuser's job is to tell the experts what kind of wiring and such is on the bomb, and the experts look them up in the manual.  The experts then tell the defuser what to do to disarm each module.  Usually the game consists of a series of questions and instructions.  This might sound boring to some people, but the modules are very well designed to make it fun.  They range from simple wires that require going through a list of options until you get to the correct one, to "who's on first" modules that require careful enunciation.  The modules that are the least interesting also take the least time.\nI think most people would progress in skill quickly, but fortunately, so does the game.  There are quite a number of scenarios that excellently pace the players through all the mechanics, and each one is procedurally generated.  There's also a custom bomb mode that could provide theoretically endless hours.  One would think that the game would become repetitive, but it literally takes five minutes, so it never feels grindy.  The one thing I could see to improve the game would simply be more modules.  But there's certainly enough as it is.\n\nAesthetic: 20/20\nThe game isn't the most realistic looking, but it's in that zone and feels super appropriate.  Everything looks nice, there's no extraneous clutter, and the sounds are perfectly suited to the atmosphere.  The details are nice too; occasionally the lights will turn off for a few seconds, but the lit screens on the bomb stay visible.  Great job here.\n\nLength: 9/10\nWhile the game provides a mountain of different possibilities, it does have a limit.  That limit won't be reached for a long time, but it's there.  It's kind of like a Rubik's cube: once you've mastered it, then you can only refine your skills.  But it has like ten times the fun and complexity of a Rubik's cube.\n\nTechnical: 20/20\nThe game runs smoothly.  I haven't run into any bugs whatsoever, and the manual is easily available online as a pdf, a webpage, or printed.  The controls are tight.  Not much to say when there's nothing wrong. :)\n\nTotal: 97/100\nKeep Talking and Nobody explodes is one of the best games I've picked up this year.  It's simple, but that simplicity is one of it's strengths.  It's a pure rendition of a great idea, and will surely bring a lot of laughter and yelling.","October 11, 2015","true","3.9"," 92 of 98 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","92","98","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wolfblitz101/recommended/341800/","wolfblitz101","The Gringo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wolfblitz101/","115 products in account","I will review this from two points of view: As gamer, and as an ESL teacher. At the time of reviewing this I have only 30 minutes played, but my experience with this game goes beyond my own account.\n\nGamer:\nIf you're looking for an epic single player dungeon crawler like Skyrim or Witcher, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a guns-blazing experience like CoD or Battlefield, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a slow, calm strategic game for the family like Monopoly, look elsewhere.\nWhat you will find here is a unique experience that other games cannot deliver.\n-Communication and trust are key. They are more necessary in this simple game than in any military shooter or other co-op experience that you will find.\n-There is also a small bit of strategy that plays into the game; do you tell you friend(s) about the easy modules first, or the hard one? Do you use your own memorized knowlegde of the manual to save some time, or rely on the expert that has the manual in hand?\n-A single mistake, even in the early levels, can cause panic. Some of the multi-stage modules will reset to the beginning if you make a mistake. My wife and I played this game together. She had the manual. We had over a minute left. It was a module that requires you to remember numbers and positions. We were on the second to last step, and I made a mistake. We stayed calm and kept going. Step three, she read the wrong instructions. One chance left. Thirty seconds. I'm almost shouting the numbers. Fifteen seconds. She's reading too slow. Last stage. I say the number. Time: five seconds. She starts reading the instructions. I can't... I push the button. An explosion rocks our living room. Moments before we had been calm and collected, and in the final two seconds I panicced and pushed a random button.\n-Replayability; Even playing through the same levels with a different friend can be exciting. Once you're tired of that, there's a free play mode that allows you to customize the game to your liking. Make it as hard or easy as you like. Want to give yourself thirty seconds to solve 11 modules with no extra chances if you make a mistake? It's your funeral, but you can.\n-Party play; Break this game out during a party or dinner with friends and you'll have an extremely exciting experience.\n\n\nESL Teacher (Adult students)\nI'm always looking outside the classroom for things that can help improve the learning experience. This game has extremely high potential. Once students have reached an appropriate level of fluency, this game will provide a tense situation in which they will need to work together outside their own language. Considering the bomb manual is in English, translating the instructions back into their native tongue will only slow them down. I will definitely use this in my classroom to provide an interesting alternative to drilling vocabulary.\n(Note to devs: If you don't want me to use this in a classroom setting, just let me know.)\n\nDo I recommend this game? Absolutely.\n\nNow excuse me, I need to go learn Morse Code.","October 12, 2015","true","4.4"," 82 of 90 people (91%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","91","82","90","15","2"

Can you even be offended at that? The game does use polygonal graphics and what appears to be vertex lighting, but I think most integrated graphics chips can handle this amount of detail. Don't quote me on that one. Most systems out there can run this game no problem... If they are Windows systems.\n\nMaybe the friend requirement? Flipping through the manual yourself still provides an interesting experience. The entire game can be beaten with one person or with the participation of 20 or more people. How many games are like that?\n\nLack of voice chat feature? The game has full Steam support, making this a non-issue.\n\nLack of netcode? The design of the game makes this irrelevant. You don't even need an internet connection, but to initially download the game.\n\nFrustration? You can pick up or close the game at any time. Learning to play it without griping at others or being discouraged is probably good for your social health. It's far less frustrating or "cheap" than many modern games, too: bounding boxes in Dark Souls 2, spawns in flanking in Call of Duty, unreasonable level design in Hotline Miami 2. Bombs are self-contained puzzles and you lose only seconds if you make a mistake, not hours of effort. In fact, the more level-headed you are, the better you will be at the game.\n\nBrevity? This one I could see, but the main collection of bombs is only to introduce the mechanics and give some gimmicky setups in the first place. Once you complete it, you can free play whenever you want, as the design calls for well over 11^11 (that's about 2.9 * 10^11) variations. It's unlikely you will ever play the same bomb twice if your objective is variation.\n\nCost? It's $15 right now; if you go in with friends it's a drop in the bucket. I don't feel too bad about the development:cost differential, but I suppose that's up to personal preference.\n\nKeep Talking and Nobody explodes is an accessible, inexpensive, tightly designed game. Even if you're never played a party game or don't care for them, this one is a glimmering example. After hours of consideration, the only problem I can think of is that it seems to be Windows-only at the moment. Do you have Windows and some fraction of $15? Do you like fun games that reward skill, intelligence, and cooperation? If you said yes, it's time to buy.","May 3","true","74.3"," 39 of 41 people (95%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","95","39","41","8","0"

Have PTSD? Want to have fun? BUY THIS GAME  Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes is a very different multiplayer experience and may und up with ruined friendships. You either have a buddy on steam chat or in the same room not able to see your screen tell you how to defuse a bomb. You can not see the defuse guide and the people with the defuse guide (Experts) can not see the screen. So you got to describe every little detail to them as they ask you questions. I personaly played a very little amount but already had a blast with my friends. Because the game offers Freeplay mode where you can choose time limit, how many modules and more. You also need to be very crafty when it comes to some of the modules. Like the symbol pad modules. You WILL come up with names for these symbols. Ex: Alien mothership, man purse, bathtub. The possibilites are endless.  One recomendation is that the buddy you play with is a good friend because he can screw you over with some simple words. I personaly was the bomb defuser and my buddy the expert.  DONT HAVE FRIENDS? NO PROB!  Just message a few of your steam friends "Want to help defuse a bomb?" That will get their attention. I highly doubt that this review will ever have to be changed due to the nature of the game. YOU LITTERALY CANT SCREW IT UP! I remember doing things similar to this back in elementry school. But because i designed the stuff it was easy.    NOTE IF YOU HAVE ISSUES WITH THE HEART DUE TO STRESS DO NOT PLAY.    In the first mission I was sweating so bad that at the end I had to put ice in my shirt. This a great party game to play with people you know and people you dont know.

You had to trust everything they said and follow their instructions exactly. Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes takes this concept and makes it hilarious and fun. The concept is devilishly simple in design, one player defuses the bomb, another player has the instructions of how to defuse it. Neither of them can see what the other is doing. Communication is absolutely integral to the gameplay of this title. Psychologist will probably use this game to stress test people. This is as much of a social experiment as it is a clever puzzle game. Visually, Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes is rather simple, nothing to fancy but it does look good. The music on other hand does get more violent and intense as the timer begins to run down. Adding to the delicious stress and tension. Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes is an amazing example of thinking outside the box and typical gaming conventions. This is why I love Indie Games this is the type of innovation that Triple A developers would never dare to try. There is excellent design here, no bugs, and something anyone can play. The only gripe I could muster is that the person giving the instructions might not have as much fun as the bomb defuser.  Otherwise this is a great game and easily worth your attention, time, and money!\n\nI made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\nhttps://youtu.be/gzsmog5iCzQ\nI hope you enjoy!\nMartyr","October 16, 2015","true","0.7"," 25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","25","28","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/saunika/recommended/341800/","saunika","saunika","http://steamcommunity.com/id/saunika/","98 products in account","Let me start by pointing out the two factors that had me hesitating this purchase, in case anyone else has similar concerns:\n\n1. Is this game too complicated to play with an average non-gamer buddy?\n2. Is this seemingly one-trick-pony really worth the price they're asking?\n\nI played this game with my girlfriend using an Oculus Rift DK2 and by the end of the first bomb disarm, my concerns disappeared almost instantly.\n\nThe manual, complicated as it may seem on first glance, is actually pretty straight-forward. The rules for each module (puzzles you need to solve in order to disarm the bomb) only really start to make sense when you're in the moment and they turn out to be pretty easy to understand. The game's "story" mode, if you can call it that, felt like a really good learning curve that hooks you in instantly. I switched between the defuser and instructor and both felt equally challenging and fun to play. You don't necessarily need to have any prior knowledge to understand and complete each module, although it may help speed up your time. Communication is really all it boils down to.\n\nSo, once we got the hang of the game and the modules, did it start to feel stale? After all, there's only a handful of modules, right? Nope. The possibilities feel endless and every new bomb feels like a fresh challenge. Even when you get a set of modules that don't intimidate you at all, you're still rushing for a faster time than the last. Best of all, failing at this game doesn't feel annoying or like you're being punished. Every failure makes you analyze where you went wrong and how you can improve next time. Before you know it, you're rushing back into retrying.\n\nSo, is it worth the price?\n\nPersonally, I thought it was pretty steep for a game that's sole objective involves you sitting in one room and defusing a bomb. As soon as I got to experience it, however, I realized that this game plays and feels like a good tabletop game without any of the annoying setup and reset times. Its super interactive and uses an original simple objective that is infinitely entertaining. Its the kind of game you can put down for a few months and come back to when you have some friends over and have just as much fun as the first time you played it. In that sense, I think the price is justified. This game wouldn't even need to be a video game to be enjoyed, but it just works so well in the digital medium.","October 10, 2015","true","6.8"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","21","22","2","1"

Oh well, it's not the end of the world. :/\n\nBest CO-OP game of 2015.\n\nOn a more serious note, this is probably the best and most amazing CO-OP game I've ever played. Also slightly thrifty considering the fact that not everyone who wants to play needs to purchase as they can be the bomb defusal expert who explains what the ♥♥♥♥ you need to do.\n\nThis game can be extremely stressful at times, I recommend going into thsi game with absolutely ZERO knowledge on how to play, and don't allow your defuser to read anything until you start. This will make it more enjoyable. I love the fact that when you repeat levels they change the bomb so you don't really ever get a bomb with the exact same amount/type of modules often, if at all. The only downside is that there aren't enough variables in regards to some of the "mini-games" or modules, for example I've played for two hours with a few of my friends and I now memorized most of how to defuse the simple wires, and how to do simon says depending on your bomb's serial number. (I was never the person that read the manual, and did not even open the .pdf, but getting the same module too many times may do this to you).\n\nAll in all, I'll keep this review relatively short. The game does a lot to try to throw you off, it flickers lights, goes completely dark, makes annoying noises, makes the bomb beep in a random fashion, and just tries to ♥♥♥♥ you up for the sake of a challenge. This is extremely appreciated as it makes the game much more stressful and enjoyable.\n\nThis is one of the few games that I have ever rated highly, but it deserves a 9/10, even for concept alone. I'm surprised nobody else ever thought to do this.\n\nThis game can easily be a party game, place a laptop on a table, a few bomb defusal manuals, place blankets or something so eye contact cannot be made, and start yelling at each other.

What excites me the most is that there is currently a version 1 manual for bomb defusal. This opens the possiblitly of more manuals coming out for later released versions. If thats the case, the replay value, which is already pretty high, will be that much higher.\n\nThis game is designed for two or more players, but after playing with a buddy of mine for a couple of hours I am reasonably certain that even playing solo will provide an interesting challange.

KT&NE puts one player in the position of the bomb handler, while their teammates will come to the game equipped with an in-depth bomb manual. You know where this is going. One player will be restricted to viewing the bomb, and their job is to describe the various modules to the person with the manual, in order for the 'expert' (manual holder) to help them out to defuse it. This. Game. Is. Epic.\n\nGameplay\nThat depends on how good you are at communicating. All of the tools come with this game to create an epic gameplay experience, whether you're using KT&NE as a party game with friends, or utilising a voice communcation program and using digital copies of the manual; this game has the potential to make or break friendships. There is nothing more frustrating than losing a level becuase your friend ain't bright enough to listen to simple instructions!!1!one!!.. Right!?\n\nGraphics & Sound\nIncredible. This game is supported by both PC and Virtual Reality.

If your manual-reader or manual-readers screw up and you end up getting a strike, it's not going to do you any good to get angry with them - if anything, it will just make them more nervous and more likely to screw up a second or third time during the same run.\n\nThat having been said, the game also has various ways in which it likes to give you a swift kick in the stones when it comes to rattling your nerves: There's a desk clock sitting next to you, and from time to time it likes to set off its alarm mid-mission. If you happen to be spectacularly unlucky, the game will cut power to the lights for a few seconds, leaving you in the darkness. No, don't turn up the brightness on your monitor to compensate. That's cheating.\n\nOverall, I have to say that the game is great fun, and I'd love to play even more of it, but my boyfriend is boycotting his role as manual-reader for the rest of the evening due to his nerves being completely wrecked. Hopefully I can get a group together this weekend to play it some more.","October 8, 2015","true","4.3"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","16","16","2","0"

One of the things they've done best is that it's very hard to act as an expert without the manual.  Playing a few games, there were only a few things as a defuser that I was able to learn and do autonomously.  The number of different modules types that you have to solve is well balanced between over-familiarity and needing to flip through too many pages each time.  Naming the puzzles is good for progressing as a team.  The manual is well made, although it could benefit from a contents page.\n\nThe game is very fun as a party game or team game with friends.  It's pretty fun to teach and quick to learn if someone is teaching you.  It also is pretty fun to play by yourself (reading the manual yourself) and is a good way to learn the game's modules in order to teach others.  However, it's not recommended that you buy the game just to play it yourself.","October 9, 2015","true","2.7"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

It's an amazing co-op experience. I've been asking random people on Steam that I never talk to to play it with me (five minutes or less!) and they're always skeptical at first but after 15 minutes they're hooked. I've convinced two people to buy it already. I've created or renewed friendships with people I didn't know just by playing this game for a bit. If you're shy but enjoy video games, try playing this sucker with someone.

I would also like to mention it's totally her fault and definitely not mine as she continually insisted.  Despite my consistent tendency to die a horribly painful firey death, cursing her name as the flesh charred from my bones like some sort of circle of the inferno, I continuously came back for more. Repeating the proces of this unique and wonderful torture until my gut became sore with laughs.  The game does a great job of ramping up the complexity of the bomb defusal process, allowing an extremely false sense of confidence to build. As you defuse bomb after bomb, you start to think "Hey. I'm pretty good at this. Maybe I should look into a bomb defusal school, or something. I could save lives!" the game slams you back to reality by blindsiding you with a request to remember steps you have taken previously.  As the timer continued it's deathmarch to my oblivion, I sat there, cursing the heavens that it was "unfair" to presemue I, a simple bomb defusal expert, could remember uncomplicated steps I took literally moments ago.  Despite the extremely painful process of exploding, I am glad I finally got to play this game, and look forward to the day when I can sweat over a bomb in an oculus / vive or some other future type device.","October 26, 2015","true","0.7"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","8","8","2","0"

You and the people you're working with will quickly develop a set of things to be looking for, fast solutions, and a vocabulary unique to the group. Do be forewarned that this game can be stressful and hectic, but cathartic when the puzzle is completed. I cannot recommend this game for people who don't handle stress well or have a heart condition so take it with a grain of salt that I find this game fun. The random nature of the modules and the time limit aren't your only obstacles, an alarm on the desk can go off making communication with your team difficult, the lights can go out without warning and may or may not come back on, as well as modules that need to be regularly interacted with, a limited number of mistakes that can even be removed entirely meaning your first mistake is your last, and various other parts of interest on the bomb that can change how each module is disarmed.\n\nDo you love puzzles? Do you love communicating what you can see to people that cannot? Do you love being under a time crunch that challenges you to be clear and concise while trusting your friends to communicate back to you?\nThen Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes is perfect for you.\nAre you easily distracted, easily stressed out, or have a heart condition that is exacerbated by being stressed out?\nAvoid this game like the plague!\n\nBoth you and your team will get frustrated early and often, the twenty-three page manual is clear but difficult to work through without a physical copy in front of you, but once the modules are solved and the bomb is disarmed you and your team feel fantastic as the tension and stress are all released.","November 4, 2015","true","3.3"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/snowdusk/recommended/341800/","snowdusk","Snowdusk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/snowdusk/","87 products in account","Most people have probably heard of Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes (abbreviated as KTANE) and watched someone else play it in Youtube or Twitch. Most of these people would have also played along with other people who owned KTANE because only one copy of the game is required for an entire party to play, which is awesome.\n\nAt this point, these people can't help but to buy their own copy of the game because of the sheer amount of fun it offers. So what exactly makes this game fun?\n\nWell first of all, there is a timed bomb involved. Only one person (the bomb defuser) gets to disarm it while the rest of his friends (the bomb experts) will try to help him based on a bomb manual. The catch is: only the bomb defuser is allowed to see the bomb, and only the bomb experts are allowed to look at the manual. That makes communication an integral part of KTANE, making it an excellent social party game.\n\nNow I will share my personal experience with this game as well. When I got my siblings to play KTANE with me, I didn't carry any high expectations at first. My younger brother and sister hardly ever liked the same games as I do. Whenever I try to get them to play a game with me, they were clearly uninterested. But when I bought KTANE and convinced them to try it out together, they played it and agreed that it was thrilling. Soon, as we're disarming bombs like a real team, I realised how exciting it is to find a common game where everyone plays a role in it.\n\nThe game is definitely worth the price, so go ahead and grab the game if you can find a group of people to play with. There's a saying that goes "time plus tragedy equals comedy". And since this game is all about timed bombs, getting a bunch of people to scream orders over a virtual bomb can be pretty funny.","November 8, 2015","true","7.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","8","9","2","0"

The concept is both simple and complex, as it all comes down to communicating a series of small tasks to a friend before a bomb explodes.  Sounds easy, but in practice, gets tricky very quickly.  Hijinks will ensue, someone WILL blow up, and everyone will have their blood pumping as they laugh at the end of both successful defusals and violent ends.\n\nAlso, I suspect almost any system can run this.  Hell, in a game with a live bomb, there isn't even a visual explosion, and I DID NOT CARE.  It's just... I mean... this game is so.... perfect.\n\nBuy this.  Pay these people.  Support it, nurture it, and make sure that the people at Steel Crate Games get rich fast enough to pump out more content for this game while continuing to innovate.\n\nSteel Crate Games?  Have my baby, damn it.  I don't even care if you blow it up afterwards because we miscounted the number of hairs on his/her head and mistook a light brown for a carrot top.","October 10, 2015","true","21.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","78","7","9","5","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IamCreepy/recommended/341800/","IamCreepy","Dillan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IamCreepy/","197 products in account","Keep talking and nobody explodes, is a fun game in which the owner of the game has a bomb that  he or she must defuse with the help of their loyal freinds who have a bomb defusal guide writhing with all the details on the bomb and all its modules. The bomb defuser is given a bomb with a variey of modules and must defuse it without looking at the guide him/herself. thats also the same the other way around the bomb experts are only able to read the guide and are not alowed to see the bomb. this makes for an interesting gameply style as communication is key.Truthfully this game is a breath of fresh air. its unique and is quite fun to play, the only problem i have with it is the fact that i have no freinds.\n\nGameplay - 9/10\n-the gameplay is fun, whether it be sittting in the same room wiht your freinds or playing over skype or streams or any other way. the mechanics are simple yet, work well with the gameplay and Design. the modules can range from being easy, to being dificult real quick, and the short bomb times makes it an easy game to jump into and out of real quick. The bomb times usually last between 3 to 5 minutes although can be changed in the free play mode. Because the gameplay is based around communication things can get pretty tense between you and your freinds this makes it more enjoyable. as there is no better feeling then dissarming a bomb with less then 5 seconds remaining after yelling to your freind " I'm just going to cut the black wire and hope for the best!" and it actually working. But like i said earlier you need people to play this game, that being said' its still a good buy for those occasions that your freinds do come by for a visit or your family want to play.\n\nGraphics- 7/10\nthis secction will be quite small. the graphics are simple in nature and don't contract away from the gameplay. this game could be a retro 8-bit game and it would still be good as the gameplay elements are there. The textures are good and the simple designs of the bomb and surroundings work well within the game\n\nStory- 2/10\nthere is no story, again this game focuses around the gameplay. However if you really wanted you could roleplay with freinds and make your own story for the situation to make the gameplay feel more hectic and fun.\n\nOverall- 9/10\nthis game is amazingly fun and as long as you have people to play with you should  be fine. even if you don't it shouldnt be hard to find someone, a family member will do fine. even a random on steam is ok, as long as they have a microphone that workls well and there is no language barriers then it should work out fine. so overall this game is worth  the small amount of money the developers are asking.","October 28, 2015","true","10.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

May be a little more fun if at least one of you is new to it, but even if you've watched people play it online it's still an awesome game with friends. 5 mins is 100 times shorter when YOU ARE the ones who are actually trying to defuse the bomb.

Since only one person needs to own the game and the manual is readily accessible for everyone else, it's a fun game to rope people into with minimal effort.\n\nSo far we've had a lot of fun with this one, but I'm hoping that they update with more module types/puzzles, an updated manual with more possible combinations/solutions for existing modules, and touchscreen support (would be great to be able to play natively on my Surface Pro and interact with the bomb with touch-optimised controls).\n\nDefinitely recommended.

I really hope that there will be a lots of manual available later on and if you can support 3rd parties it would be even more fun.","October 8, 2015","true","1.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

They don’t require a tremendous amount of money and time spent. Sometimes all it takes is a weekend and a huge coffee supply. For Steel Crate Games that weekend was Global Game Jam 2014, where they made a concept for an Oculus Rift game where only one player sees what’s happening on screen.\n\nLuckily, the final version of Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes doesn’t require any kind of virtual reality set, but it still needs one very important component – co-players. The game is impossible to play solo and you’ll need at least one more person in the same room, or the next room if shouting across the apartment is ok with you, or if all else fails, an online co-player who you can talk to through a VOIP service.\n\nKeep Talking and Nobody Explodes is a game you simply must try out, it’s both a video game and a social game, and simultaneously a test for reflexes and concentration. No video in the world can possibly convey the exact feeling you get while playing – frantically going through pages with schemes and directions or waiting for your co-players to come up with a solution while there’s only seconds left on the timer. Get your copy, call your friends, neighbors and colleagues, print out the manual and dig into one of the most exciting co-op experiences of all time. And keep talking, never stop talking. Because if you keep talking nobody will explode.\n\nFull review here: http://play-zine.com/2015/11/keep-talking-and-nobody-explodes/","March 1","true","3.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

You've probably never played anything like it--the real gameplay is not the puzzles you solve, but the communication between you and your "expert".  Plays well locally or over any voice chat program.\n\nPuzzles are cleverly designed to have just enough parts to them that you're always going to have to look them up not just remember them, so communication remains a factor. Interestingly, you basically also reset the difficulty just by getting a new "expert" who doesn't know the game as well.\n\nEscalation of difficulty is smooth but quite fast. Morse code puzzles are a bit of a brick wall, but otherwise each new puzzle was challenging but reasonable to overcome, and the bombs grow more complex as you go through the..."story mode" or whatever you want to call it.","October 8, 2015","true","2.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

This game is the best cooperative game I've ever downloaded, bar none.\n\nDefusing bombs while another reads the instructions sounds simple, and it is - at first.  We're playing through the story mode that slowly ramps up the difficulty, and every time it's a new challenge.  Having a paper manual as the second player's only resource really brings more tension; there's something unnerving about listening to papers rustle when the clock is ticking down.  The music is fitting, the visuals are simple but effective.  The controls are intuitive and don't require much adjustment on the part of the active player.  I can see why it's becoming a popular game to break out at parties, but I would advise against playing under the influence of ANYTHING - you will need as much concentration and mental acuity as you can muster.  Once you hit a certain threshhold, the game will try to distract you, and the puzzles will be harder to solve - both harder to describe and harder to complete.\n\nMy husband and I are excellent communicators and don't hold grudges easily - we did awesome.

This game is the best cooperative game I've ever downloaded, bar none.\n\nDefusing bombs while another reads the instructions sounds simple, and it is - at first.  We're playing through the story mode that slowly ramps up the difficulty, and every time it's a new challenge.  Having a paper manual as the second player's only resource really brings more tension; there's something unnerving about listening to papers rustle when the clock is ticking down.  The music is fitting, the visuals are simple but effective.  The controls are intuitive and don't require much adjustment on the part of the active player.  I can see why it's becoming a popular game to break out at parties, but I would advise against playing under the influence of ANYTHING - you will need as much concentration and mental acuity as you can muster.  Once you hit a certain threshhold, the game will try to distract you, and the puzzles will be harder to solve - both harder to describe and harder to complete.\n\nMy husband and I are excellent communicators and don't hold grudges easily - we did awesome.  Not every group will fare so well.  This is a potential friendship killer, but it's a great way to build communication and trust skills with the people you know will walk away as friends; even if you did blow them up a few times.\n\nFinal rating - 8/10:  Needs the right co-op players, but totally worth it!","February 25","true","3.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

As everyone becomes more acquainted with how things work, the bombs get harder and the focus shifts to efficiency and effectiveness of your communication. The time pressure gets harder to deal with, and that keeps the game interesting.","October 13, 2015","true","17.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In this game you are given a bomb that you must defuse, with the help of your ally, they cant see your screen, and you cant see the manual; they must guide you through disarming the bomb in the matter of 5 minutes with up to 12 puzzling modules.\n\nI recommend this game to players who have very close friends, as this is a game that tests the trust between one and another, either leaving you in the end closer to that person than you were before; or kicking them out of your life for being poor at helping a friend.\n\nGameplay Here for Reference ►\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4vyoCB9Q-c","January 27","true","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And unlike extremely limiting party games like Towerfall and Gang Beasts, to which you are limited to having your play partners in the same room, this game can be played over long distances as long as one has access to voice chat, the .pdf file, and the game itself (only one copy is needed).\n\nI think that's one of the things that stands out. With this harebrained, arrogant, and contradictory resurgence of local multiplayer games (because the internet and online play is way more readily available to most), KTANE stands out among the rest with its ease of accessibility over online mediums.\n\nBut I digress. This bomb defusing game is stressful, intense, and loads of fun. I hope to god this isn't milked at all though.

You learn very quickly that you and your friend have to figure out how to communicate in the shortest amount of time possible, and to avoid stressing out even as the music begins to ramp up and the timer ticks down. I would definitely recommend picking this up, because not only do you only need to purchase one copy, but your friend doesn't even have to be nearby to play, as long as you have Skype/Teamspeak/Mumble and they are near a computer. The bombs get progressively more challening and do a great job in ramping up the difficulty slowly enough where you aren't overwhelmed, but quick enough where there's still that panic of 'we need to go fast or we're going to blow up'.","October 13, 2015","true","6.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You would never think scrolling through a PDF could be tense, exciting, and enjoyable, but this game makes it happen. It's a great social game that puts your ability to communicate to the test. The difficulty curve is set up so that early on, when you need to learn to how best express information about the bomb, there are only a few simple tasks to work out. This gives you the time you need to work things out. As everyone becomes more acquainted with how things work, the bombs get harder and the focus shifts to efficiency and effectiveness of your communication. The time pressure gets harder to deal with, and that keeps the game interesting.","October 13, 2015","true","17.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Unless you're looking to memorize the manual, a friend is needed to play this game. On the bomb their are modules that you need to disarm to defuse he bomb. Their are 8+ different types of modules that can appear on the bomb. Their are strikes on the bomb, meaning you can only fail 2 times without the bomb exploding, but the timer speeds up on those first 2 times. On the first strike, after 0.75 seconds, a second will pass on the timer. On the second strike, after 0.50 seconds, a second on the timer will pass. Anyways, I love playing this game with my friends. The communication aspect of this game is better than any other. The game is as complex and simple as it needs to be. Some modules are hard for the defuer to understand, and some are hard for the expert to understand. One of my least favorite modules is Morse Code. I cannot seem to figure out Morse Code, you have say "Dot" or "Dash" to get your friend to find the word needed to disarm the module. My final rating of this game is a 92/100. This game is excellent, and I will find endless enjoyment in it and I hope you do too.","January 15","true","6.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

We've completed more than half of the 'campaign' and had a blast doing it (pun intended, of course)! The mechanics of the game are extremely different from any other game I have played before, allowing for stressful teamwork practice, and brings groups of people together very well. Some of the modules are a little difficult, but as long as you're willing to work on your problems, you can solve them all!\n\nNow, I'm not going to be solely jovial in this review. I do have one predicament that consistently occurs throughout the late-game. It effectively renders this game unplayable, and puts players in the presence of an AIDS-causing, Ebola-inducing, cancerous impass.\n\nMorse code.\n\n♥♥♥♥ this game.\n\nMorse code is quite possibly the worst-developed feature of any puzzle game I have played in my entire 17 years of life. I cannot possibly pontificate the insanity caused by this ♥♥♥♥ing gameplay element! Seriously! What the ♥♥♥♥ were the devs thinking putting in a ♥♥♥♥ing light that blinks in an undecipherable ♥♥♥♥♥how causing all your ♥♥♥♥ing friends to circlejerk around each other until their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ retinas melt. The amount of grief our friends and I have had over this has split our group up, and we are no longer able to function as humans, let alone a cooperative unit.\n\nMy friend David has gone into a deep depression after coming into contact with this devious device of destructive, dissatisfactory disorder. Multiple times have I attempted to converse with him, and he will just repeat "dot dash dash. That's not even in the ♥♥♥♥ing list!". He is unable to bring himself back to sanity as this menacing module has destroyed his hopes in humanity, and for his future.\n\nSincerely ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off,\n\nDicke","April 15","false","6.4"," 16 of 53 people (30%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","30","16","53","22","5"

Not visual. My wife and I really enjoyed this game, except for the morse code modules. The morse code is easy to understand with minimal practice for me. However, my wife has chronically dry eyes. To interpret the morse code modules, you literally cannot blink for, at minimum, 2 letters worth of visual input, which is at a minimum approximately 3 seconds. Any bomb that has morse code, my wife has to turn the monitor to me so that I can interpret the code. If the developer updates the morse code to audio, or some mod comes out to make it audible, then I would absolutely recommend the game.\n\nTL:DR - Visual morse code requires not blinking.

The first bomb defuser was not a computer expert and so the conversation went like this:\n\nus: cut the last wire!!\nthem: I can't, I don't know how.\nus: idiot! its so easy, just click it.\nthem (frusterated): I AM!! The game doesn't work, nothing works... The bomb just exploded guys...\n\nThis happened for two attempts until we finally decided to investigate. Turns out the game was not taking any mouse input. Some input worked, like you could choose menu's etc, but you could not manipulate the bomb in any way (click, rotate etc).\n\nTo fix we had to Alt-tab. The full screen of black was also fixed by alt-tabbing. It was not clear when this issue would happen so often during game play we would need to alt-tab out of the game and then back in. The requirement to do this was too tedious for the non-computer savvy players and so it forced only one player to be the bomb defuser.\n\nA game with a near perfect score should not have such a debilitating issue.\n\nWe played on a Surface Pro. We played last weekend 11/14/2015.\nI see a patch came out recently that fixed issues with incorrect resolutions. I have not played the game since to see if it was responsible for these issues.","November 19, 2015","false","2.8"," 55 of 415 people (13%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","13","55","415","17","10"

The game is an amazing cooperative game and sincerely amazing to play. Though, most of your steam friends probably don't have this game - nor either know about it. But the thing that sparks me the most about this game is the main menu. You can't see your feet when you look down in the main menu... But the chair moves. How unrealistic. But in all seriousness, without friends this game makes you want to rage, and some of the modules are just complete bull crap. It took me about 3 hours to figure out how complicated wires work, and morse code is just insanely tough. Needy Modules surprisingly aren't that much of an issue. Wire Sequences got me confused too. It took me about an hour to figure that one out. And the worst part - NOW TO TEACH MY FRIENDS. (It's always the wires...) I always forget to check if the serial number has a vowel or not for Simon Says (which is my fault), and some of the "Who's on First" things just always get me. Don't get me started on passwords.\n\nOverall the game is fun with friends, though teaching the complicated stuff about the game will take a super long time - especially practicing with them. They will never figure it out. In fact, you might never figure it out. When I printed out the bomb defusal manual, I literally had to tab each page what they are. I had to literally tape part of a piece of paper to the side of the defusal manual to figure out where stuff is. But the manual is set-up perfectly though, I have to give them credit for that. But if you don't have anyone to play with, then this game is not worth the 14.99, or whatever it is in European-O's. If you have friends, good luck teaching it to them.\n\nI am still gonna play more than 5 hours of the game obviously, and try to complete all of the chapter/tutorial/numbered bombs, and beat the game. The game would be better if it was 9.99, or even 4.99, and yes... just to answer your question (IT WASN'T ON SALE ON THE STEAM SALE HOLIDAYS). (WHICH IS WHEN I BOUGHT IT).\n\n5.8/10 - wait no. As I'm writing this I realized they released it for mac before christmas. Smart idea. Gotta give them credit for that.\n\n6/10 - wait no. VR Support. But doesn't support mac. But not their fault.\n\n6.5/10 - it's an amazing cooperative game, though, could use a global-multiplayer chatting system.\n\n(No, I won't refund it.)","December 27, 2015","false","6.7"," 21 of 268 people (8%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","8","21","268","16","9"

Finnaly figured out how to prevent it from showing up on the free play mode so it's playable again.  but it is annoying that now I can't go any farther on the regular mode that light just blinks way to fast and while I can tell the dots from the dashes I can't tell where the end of the letter is or comunicate that with out already missing most of the info for the next letter.  I'd still recomend this game as in freeplay mode with the morse code turned off in the accessbitly settings, this game is rather fun.  but if I was giving it point rating I'd still give it a low one for making that module required to play the rest of the game. heck even if I had to push a button to advace to the next letter that would be way better then it just running them all together like it does.\n\nso to recap the freeplay mode is great fun once you get the accessbily settings setup properly, and if you got a friend or a group of fiends to play it with then it's fun.  but the rest of the game I wouldn't recomend because the morse code puzzle is way off the diffculty curve and shows up pretty early on, and then is in most bombs there after. Also there is no player matching system so if you don't got at least one friend willing to play it with you then you can't play it the way it was designed to be played.","December 4, 2015","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's co-op gameplay in a way I've never experienced before with a high social aspect. It can be played online with a chat client like Skype, but I recommend playing with friends in one room. The first stage is about learning all modules and how to beat them, after which the heat is slowly turned up with less time and more stress factors. The final stage is about having a larger group (ideally 3-4 persons) to find the perfect "workflow" to tackle even the hardest challenges. Some great moments await: defusing a bomb at less than a second, taking a gamble to pull it off, or a hard to accept fail with the last wire. The shouting, the concentration and the great feeling of accomplishment. No time for bed, 'cause there's one more attempt to make. Highly recommended unless you have no one to play with.","April 1","true","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"Keep Talking..." will never be a killer app for these platforms; the phrase "co-operative bomb defusal" doesn't mesh well with "isolation chamber" in the first place. This game really leans on the least-appreciated of technologies:  the printed word (and, y'know... the pre-requisite computer running Steam).\n\nInvite some friends over, hand over some paper at the door, and ask, "Do you remember when the 90s action hero had to defuse a bomb?"

Yelling at your friends. This game has all three of those things in abundance. This game is meant for "2 or more" players as the game puts it. While you can play it by yourself, I don't think you will get much enjoyment out of it that way. I believe 2 people is the sweet spot, but 3 is also workable. I believe any more than 2 experts + 1 defuser would lose a lot of challenge and become less fun. The game is repetitive for sure, but I think it bypasses that due to its nature of being meant to be played with friends.\n\nIf you have a friend or two to play with, I would say this is a definite buy. Good communication skills between friends are a must, especially in the beginning before you have established names for modules and symbols. $15 USD is a very reasonable price for the amount of fun you can get out of this especially since you only really need 1 copy of the game to play with your friends.","November 3, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I brought this game to a party, and had a blast playing with a bunch of different people. The fact that one team plays with a physical bomb defusing manual means that anyone who is curious about the game can watch and participate without any pressure.\n\nThe game also works well with Oculus Rift: being isolated in VR helps the person defusing the bomb feel isolated and impedes non-verbal communication from teammates. I was also impressed by how well the difficulty scales, given that you learn more and more of the manual by heart.\n\nIf you've got a few friends to play with, definitely check out this explooosive party game!","January 9","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some ideas I have thought of:\n-alternate shapes of bombs such as a briefcase you have to open or a sphere\n-some sort of module to unlock the bomb to access other modules\n-more things that have to do with the ports and different batteries\n-having multiple bombs in the same room with different timers even\n-a built in replay function possibly\n-more freedom in free play mode (individual bomb customization)\n-something to force an order of modules\n\nOf course the possibilites are endless with a game like this, and I sincerely look forward to an update. I would even pay for DLC for new stuff.\n\nGreat game.","October 15, 2015","true","15.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a kind of assisted-reality multi-player game that makes players work together to diffuse a bomb. The bomb is displayed and manipulated with a PC and is to be seen only by the player in the "diffuser" role while the other players use physical documentation to discover and relay information necessary for diffusing the bomb back to the diffuser. I played this game with 3 friends and rotated in and out of the "diffuser" role. We opted to just use a laptop rather than the Oculus DK2 we had available.\n\nYou could write a thesis on social interaction based on observing people play this game. It's absolutely fascinating to watch players go from being overwhelmed by the manual to becoming the "experts" the game assumes they are by title. The puzzles or "modules" as they're shown in-game translate very well to the information in the manual and served up many Ah-ha moments from both the diffuser and the experts. Quite a bit more replay-ability than I expected due to a good learning curve. I HIGHLY recommend this game.","October 30, 2015","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
