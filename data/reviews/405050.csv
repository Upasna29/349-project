The tutorial is minimal, but I did pick the gist of the game quickly enough I suppose.   The graphics look fairly dated and generic, but are serviceble enough I suppose.\n\nThe game play was the weakest part for me.  Basically the player is tasked with picking up vehicles with various thought-balloon "wants' and then dropping them at the appropiate venue.  Varous venues can be built, but several require the currency of "Bonuses" as well as in game money.  This one got very boring and repetitous for me very quickly.\n\nOddly, that doesn't mean it's easy.   One has to periodically restock one's venues, which is fair enough.  The problem is that I even dragging and dropping as quickly as I could, I found the restock fee negated any profit I was turning.   So I can add the word "fustrating" to the list of things that describe this game.\n\nI got it during a 40% sale, for the price $1.79.  I don't have high hopes for games that run that cheap, so I guess I can say it's a fair value, if drag and drop games appeal to you.  For my part though, I wish I had given this one a pass.","February 20","false","0.5"," 29 of 29 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","29","29","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/erbkaiser/recommended/405050/","erbkaiser","Erbkaiser ♔","http://steamcommunity.com/id/erbkaiser/","4509 products in account","A time management game should keep things interesting by adding new challenges or the occasional random bonus, but this game doesn't do that. I only managed to play the first four levels before I completely lost interest but every single level was the same... red car? Drag it on the red icon. Black car? Drag it on the black icon, repeat ad infinitum.\nAs you progress you need to build more and more stations (colours) to drag the cars on to, and there you have the game. You're going up against a time limit and have to juggle the non-stop drag&drop of cars against the need to upgrade existing structures, build new ones, and buy resources.\n\nThe story is told through comic panels in awkward English translated from German but is ultimately uninteresting.\n\nStay away from this one, there are far better time management games on Steam.","March 4","false","0.3"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

The art is okay, but the interface and gameplay choice for this theme just doesn't work well. Even if you are a fan of rapid drag and drop gameplay, you'll probably still be disappointed here, as the interface causes you to grab the wrong vehicle, or not accept your placement of it as you drop. Construction does pause the game, but it jumps out of pause as you as you click something, which is quite disorienting.\n\nI picked it up on sale for less than a dollar, thinking perhaps the few reviews were not a clear picture, but I should have listened to them, and I recommend you do as well. Skip this.","February 28","false","2.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I mean you can't move your mouse around for "not worth it" all the time, eh :>) you could regard that as sports for your arm/hand too though, hoping it won't weigh more towards unhealthy than helpful ... hmm am I doing this ergonomically enough???\n\njust get a Steam Controller >.<  and there you go, wish the touch options on that thing had a quick sensivity "zoom" or a acceleration that adapts to an enough filigree-degree\n\nstill it's not "sooo schlecht" (no that doesn't mean slobbering licks, watch the "ch" sound^^) then again\n\nso I'll give it a thumbs up .. if you bought it for or below 2 € it's probably okay for that price","February 18","true","1.0"," 6 of 17 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","6","17","0","0"
