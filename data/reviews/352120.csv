In Fair Strike you pilot helicopters on missions to try and stop an international drug syndicate/group of narco-terrorists from doing their business. Obviously Fair Strike is an old game, and if I'm honest it does show, so this release is more aimed towards those who played it in the past for nostalgia.\n\n+Six different helicopters to fly all with a few customisation options\n+Quite a lot of missions\n+Multiple camera views including a surprisingly well done cockpit view\n+Missions are, for the most part, straightforward\n+Nice variety of payloads for your helicopters\n+Over the top but reasonably engaging campaign story mode\n+Quite a lot of customisation for your HUD\n+Nice variety of enemies\n+Runs well on my modern PC which is good to see for such an old game\n+Has Trading Cards\n\n+/-The maximum resolution for the game is 1280x960 which is fine if you have a monitor with that resolution but it just makes the dated graphics look worse\n\n-As already mentioned the graphics are very dated and there's been no improvement on them since the game's original release\n-The controls are very difficult to get your head round and rebinding the keys only seems to work until you quit the game\n-Sound effects aren't great\n-The support for gamepad is very limited so if you want to play with a gamepad you'll need to use your keyboard too\n\nVerdict:\n6\n\nDespite being very dated Fair Strike is a fun arcade helicopter game, with a nice selection of helicopters and payloads to use on the game's many missions.\n\n***This review was written using a key provided by the Publishers for review purposes***\n\nEl K.","April 25, 2015","true","2.7"," 66 of 79 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","66","79","0","6"

The game does however work and plays smoothly on the core i7 and NVIDIA GT 770 under windows 7 64-bit.\n\nLooking past the obviously dated graphics, the gameplay is fun.  The default controls took a little time to get used to, but are functional and for the most part usable.  Be prepared to master using a wireless X-box controller in tandem with the mouse and keyboard.  There are 7 pages of default control keys / settings to memorise and the game is not playable without getting these under your thumb so to speak.\n\nThe missions are fairly straight forward with main missions and side missions to be completed and bonus objectives and achievements.\n\nThere are Steam trading cards and Steam achievements to be earned and the game is both fun to play and challenging.  Be warned that the default game setting is Hard.  There are two other settings available, Normal and Easy.\n\nThere are a variety of weapons and ordinance, and a few iconic Russian military helicopters which have been reasonably well modelled.\n\nThis game stands up fairly well with other similar games available at the time of it's original release such as the Apache Longbow series.\n\nWhile not a state of the art flight simulator, this game is far from being a pure arcade game.  It would fall somewhere in between the two.  Best description would a combat flight simulator with arcade elements.\n\nThe missions are fun to play, but are a little over-the-top fantasy with a solid melodramatic touch.  All the drug cartells in the world have united into this super criminal organisation which is stronger that the military organisations of the world's combined military super powers.  This does however provide lots of cannon fodder and bombing targets so lots of stuff to shoot and blow up!\n\nA competent game that will provide several hours of fun at a budget price.\n\n5 / 10","April 24, 2015","true","8.6"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","0"

Has cockpit view, 3rd person view and cockpitless view. Great fun with quite a high difficulty level once you progess.\nRecommend this one greatly to Helicopter shooter fans.","May 25","true","5.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Limited resolution, too many buttons, lack of full support for gamepad, it adds up to a somewhat frustrating flying experience when you just want to blow **** up.\n\nOne would have hoped that whoever made it run on modern platforms (it does run fine on Win7x64) would have bothered to create a decent mapping for gamepad, but no luck here. Game doesn't want to map a lot of commands, and have no way of figuring on which control is which. For example, let's say you want to map the two triggers to shoot... nope, can't do that. Those are ANALOG controls. ARGH! Okay, map to "rudder" (left right turns). Go into the game... It's REVERSED! I hit left and I turn RIGHT! had to go into options/controls and turn on "INVERTED". Do this for EVERY analog control. Oh, and it doesn't support the digital pad.\n\nI guess I could have opened up XPADDER and tried to remap some more commands, but I'm too tired fighting with the game rather than playing it.\n\nBeing an ancient game even on older machine frame rate is silky smooth. And graphics are decent. Sound is okay.\n\nThe main problem is the game doesn't quite seem to make of itself. Being a "Strike" series member, Fair Strike is trying to invoke some old shooters like Desert Strike, Jungle Strike, and so on, but those are isometric and semi-3D shooters. This is a full 3D arcade-y flight sim.  It'd be the difference between original River Raid and Lock-On. There's even a "simulation controls" (with full cyclic and collective controls) if you find the arcade controls (almost like hovercraft) too limiting.\n\nIf you want a fun helo shooter, go play Thunderwolves instead. This game is a bit too old and quirky to be enjoyable nowadays.","April 25, 2015","false","1.8"," 14 of 26 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","14","26","0","0"

For the  3.00 that was to be expected. What I didn't realize is that it's impossible to play via the control setup.  Xbox joystick, only a couple functions work - then it wants mouse and keyboard.  I'll try again - as something must have been wrong?   so far I can't recommend.","April 25, 2015","false","0.3"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","9","19","0","1"
