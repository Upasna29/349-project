Your little submarine was charged with the task of rescuing divers and blowing up anything else that stood in your way. (Loved it!) At long last, and many years later we elders of gaming and our whipper snapping next, next, next generation (I forget what the latest and hippest term should be...), now has a true and worthy successor!\n\nOhhhhh, the utter charming and adorable cuteness of the many cats and kittens in this game, should by no means detract you from the sheer fact that this is a bloody hard and brilliant Arcade epic! It's so awesome and so much fun, I barely know where to begin. Is it fast paced?! And how!!!! Will you become addicted?! Oh my yes indeed! Will you forget the world around you, and that you have to cook dinner for a hungry family?! *Cough, cough... errrrr I might have.... errrrrr a time or two...*  Will your trigger finger be glued to the controller?! Oh yeah!!!!\n\nGameplay is divine. Graphics and sounds are wonderful. Storyline and plot are all about saving the cat miners, and undersea milk farms from destruction... Really do you need anymore than that?!

The concept is great, the music is fantastic, and the graphics are colorful and appealing.  Where Aquakitty failed for me was poor gameplay and lack of content.\n\nThe game starts off simple, but as the difficulty ramps up, excessive quantities of bullet-sponge enemies appear and the player isn't given enough firepower to take out all of them effectively, which you MUST do for each level.  The game becomes an exercise in waiting a LONG time for things to die in front of the ship while more enemies spawn in which gets increasingly tedius and unfun.  The original 'Defender' makes you feel fast and powerful despite how hard it is - Aquakitty just makes you feel impotent due to the ridiculously low fire rate.\n\nThe game spawns enemies suddenly with absolutely no transition, and is shameless in putting them right over the cats you need to defend. As a result you end up succeeding more if you ignore the main game screen and focus on the RADAR, which does not center on your ship; if you don't look at it constantly you will have to look for the orange dot every time.  Enemy patterns feel erratic and are generally a pain to deal with, and feels unrefined compared to de-facto classic shmup style games.  Getting farther in the game offers no significant new fun or gameplay elements as you advance, adding to the tedium.  The only upgrade it gives you for advancing is a bigger "turboshot" bar which you never have enough of anyway.  Once you get 10 levels in and a few mere minutes of play, you've pretty much seen everything, and thats not much different than how it starts.  In general the game isn't even that difficult - its just comes off as being boring and annoying.\n\nPresentation is strictly bare-bones and there's no controller config so I had to use JoyToKey to let me use the shoulder triggers to reverse direction.  One of the biggest problems I have is that despite the clever theme and cute cat art, there's no story, not even a still picture with text to drive a narrative as to what you are doing, why you are doing it, or incentive to keep you interested.  As a result, the cats are more or less a graphic skin with no bearing on gameplay and no story content.  I expected more.  The trailer made the game seem a lot better than it is, and I really wanted to like it.  Maybe for a $3 price point I would have been fine with the mobile-app level of production values and features but not for $7.  Hope this review is helpful in making your purchasing decision.","February 13, 2014","false","2.1"," 87 of 130 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","87","130","0","5"

But it's ruined by extreme difficulty spikes and awkward design decisions. While the first few levels are enjoyable, and all seems well intially, the game quickly divebombs into frustrating and tedious territory.\n\nGood:\n- Great pixel art\n- Decent amount of levels/content for an arcade style game and the price.\n- Very easy to learn and control.\n\nBad:\n-Geared heavily towards luck, too little towards skill. The advantage of bullet hell shooters is that there are patterns and expectations. Players can develop skills based on what they learn from patterns. Not so here: enemy positions are randomized which creates a ton of frustration. One game you'll have red jellies congregated in one area, another game you'll be frantically rescuing the cats one after another.\n- The player is woefully underequipped to combat the majority of enemies. They absorb a stupid amount of bullets and the power ups, except the two extra cats and the bomb, are faily useless.\n- Half the nemies are programmed to dive out of the way of your vehicle. This may sound interesting at first, until you realize how much time you're spending chasing enemies that randomly move out of the way of your already underpowered weapons.\n- Difficulty essentially equates to dumping increasing amounts of enemies around the screen randomly, often before you've even finished a particular wave of foes.\n- The foreground art will regularily cover enemies and bullets making navigating around the map incredibly annoying and, again, make your survival a lucky happenstance.\n- Bullet travel length is based on the direction and speed you travel, amking moving forward actual disadvantagous in most situations, despite moving being what you need to do to survive.\n- Balancing looking up at the alarm and surviving while doding bullets is way too much to handle. There should have been any easy indicator or red arrow to show a cat is being abducted and the quickest way too them. I can't count how many cats I lost simply because the game expects you to juggle way too much visual information at once with so little direction.\n\nIt's really a shame because the first few levels promise so much more than what this game becomes. I can't recommend it when there are so many better arcade shooters in this genre available. Cute graphics and cats simply don't win out over undercooked gameplay.","February 14, 2015","false","3.7"," 45 of 64 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","45","64","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacquesLeSauve/recommended/263880/","JacquesLeSauve","JacquesLeSauve","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacquesLeSauve/","591 products in account","In the space year 20XX, the entire world's supply of milk appears to have "ran dry". This would suggest to me that sometime in the future all form of breasts will become either extinct or outlawed and force us to look elsewhere for our creamy goodness. As luck would have it for our kitty chums, though, "deep under the ocean, vast amounts of what appear to be naturally forming full fat milk were discovered". Don't ask me how the milk is now lying under the ocean. Perhaps all the world's mammaries will migrate to below the surface to escape danger or persecution in the future? Either way I guess it's only natural that boobs would eventually start heading downwards with the passage of time. But however they got there, the kitties are determined to get it out and launch an operation to mine it and send the milk gushing back forth into the world once more. But it's not a task without peril for our hungry kitties as they're attacked by unknown enemies who try to kidnap the underwater miners and keep all the lovely, delicious milk for themselves. "OH NOES!", cries the kitty captain. Oh noes, indeed. So out sets a brave pilot to shepherd the miners and destroy the threat, keeping his furry brethren in one piece and saving the world's milk(/boobs?) in the process...\n\nIf anybody says the story is dumb then you and me are gonna step outside and have words, alright?! Anyway, on with the review.\n\nIn Aqua Kitty - Milk Mine Defender, you'll pilot a small, one-man sub... one-cat sub? Whatever. You'll pilot a sub through stages that loop around on themselves and are no higher than the height of the screen, shooting waves of enemies until all have been wiped out while taking care not to lose all of your miners who walk the surface (as long as one is kept alive you're fine). Additional enemy types are gradually introduced as levels progress and power-ups are occasionally dished out to help your efforts. Its basic formula is simplicity itself, and in that comes so much of its addictive appeal and accessibility as the game sinks its claws into you and doesn't let go.\n\nIt isn't exactly laid out this way, but essentially there are three modes in the game. There's the standard style of play (available in easy and normal difficulties) where your progress is saved and failing a level means simply restarting it at any point from a map screen, while power-ups are temporary and don't carry on through stages. There's Arcade Mode, which sets you the challenge of making it through all 25 stages with one life, but with power-up drops being replaced by gems which can be used to purchase upgrades which do carry through stages but are also degraded with each hit you take. And then there's Infinite Espresso mode (also available in easy and normal) where you have to make it through as many waves as possible with one life and very limited power-ups, but at least with no miners to worry about.\n\nThere's a slight retro, SNES era style about the look of the game, complete with "chunky" sound effects and some outstanding music that never gets old and even manages to stay lodged in your head long after you've finished playing. Some people have commented about the game being too difficult. I don't really play many side scrolling shooters like this, and wouldn't consider myself especially gifted at them or anything, but I can't say I had all that much trouble with it. There were a few problem stages, sure, and achievement hunters beware, unless you have the twitchy reflexes of a coked-up cat with Tourette's on his fifth can of Red Bull then you're gonna have a ball-achingly hard time getting 100%. But to just complete the game and get most of the experience this has to offer, the rest of us mere mortals should do just fine.\n\nI think it says a lot that even 30 or so hours into this game, no matter how many times I died I still more often than not had a smile on my face and rarely did I ever feel the game was cheap or unfair (maybe aside from the red, grabby b*astards that steal your miners. THEY SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO FIRE! I swear I get nailed by their single, slow shots more than anything else). The hours easily flew by without me noticing and I found I had to stop myself from carrying on anymore trying to beat the harder challenges. If that's not a glowing recommendation for anything then I don't know what is. If I had any complaints it would be that sometimes your sub doesn't feel quite as sharp or responsive as you might like in some of the tighter spots. And while it's perfectly possible to play with a keyboard, I'd strongly advice using a controller. But otherwise, I loved almost everything about this game. Oh, except the fact they had a cat piloting a ship and didn't call him Commander Kitty... I'll never be able to forgive them for that.","January 21","true","34.6"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","100","16","16","8","2"

If by any chance you aren't so long in the tooth as some of us grandads of gaming are? heres a basic run down. First of all you don't need to be a grandad to enjoy this Kitty themed take on Defender, as it has this back to the basics timeless gameplay, sceams retro but in a revamped modern way, that many retro games fail to do.\n\nIts has bases with milkminers at the bottom mining for milk, they would rather go about their biz without being abducted by robot jellyfish. This is where you come in as you protect the miners from numerous seabeasts with fiery justice! In your seasub you have normal fire, missle and the ablity to turn about to go left or right. The map at the top is a 2D view of the sea going left and right. You can travel in circles by reaching the far end of either left or right. The map plays a very important part in the defence of the milkminers as it can give the local of each, (red dot abducter jellyfish), (white dot normal robot fish), (yellow power-up) and lastly the local of the milkmine. I think that about raps it up?\n\nIf by any chance you don't like reading I've put a sentence summing up Aqua Kitty\nAqua Kitty - Milk Mine Defender is a beautful, colourful 16-bit pixel style defender game that pays homage to retro gaming with a sound so fitting the style. Its that good!\n\n\n\nI recommend this title at full asking price.","July 14, 2014","true","1.9"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","3"

It's time to defend our milk!\nI was fortunate enough to have this game gifted to me by a friend who had an extra copy. The title alone would have made me want it, but I also saw a livestreamer play some of it. I figured it would be a purrfect way to spend a few hours. Cue those few hours becoming many hours. It is a lot of fun, and not just because it has cute cats!\n\nPros:\nThis was my first time playing an arcade shooter game. It is a good introduction to them. I enjoyed being in my submarine and shooting down robotic fish to save my milk-mining kitties from being stolen by evil jellyfish. It made me want to play more of this game and others like it.\nThe controls are great. They are smooth, responsive, and work exactly as they should. You can use a keyboard or controller. I have used the keyboard, and it worked perfectly fine, though some might prefer a controller.\nWhile the game is difficult, it is fair. Every time I died, I blamed myself rather than some cheap move on the game's part. Certainly the waves of enemies are challenging, but all it takes is practice to get through them.\nThe power-up system is an interesting one. You can get three types of power-ups, all of which depend on where you shoot robotic fish capsules. If the fish is low, medium, or high up in the water, they give different power-ups. Since these fish appear at the same points in each level, not only can you plan when you get your power-ups, but also which power-ups you will receive. The lack of randomization adds to the strategy elements of Aqua Kitty - Milk Mine Defender.\nA mini-map is in each level to help keep track of your miners and enemies. Thank goodness for that map, or it would be very hard to tell where you need to go to help your kitties. The cats will also let out pitiful mews if they are grabbed, which is a good warning for going over to save them.\nThere are 25 levels with three modes for playing them: easy, normal, and arcade. Easy and normal are different enough in terms of difficulty to make them worth having and experiencing. Arcade is insanely hard, because once you die there, you have to start all the way at the beginning. Good luck with that one!\nOne of the levels is an infinite mode. You continue playing until either you die or leave. The game keeps track of how many waves of enemies you kill, so this is a fun place to visit for testing your skills.\nRetro graphics ahoy! They are good ones, and the game is pleasant to look at. Enjoy the numerous kitties spread throughout your playtime.\nThe music is great! There are not many tracks, but each one is a fine representation of how awesome chiptunes can be.\nWhat little writing there is consists of cute and witty remarks.\nThere are 36 achievements of varying difficulty. Some are bound to be completed quickly, while others are only possible for the most experienced players. Achievement hunters beware, you won't be completing them that easily. But when you get those hard-as-heck achievements, you had better believe that it feels really, really good.\nYou are defending milk-mining kitties with a cat in a submarine. If you are still reading this review, why in the world have you not stopped to buy it?\nNeutral:\nThere is barely any storyline or characterization. Since this is not the sort of game that really demands it, I don't care a whole lot.\nMultiplayer exists for local co-op. I have not had anyone to try this with, but I did activate it once to see how it worked. It appears to be a solid feature that is fun for friends.\nIt does have trading cards. They consist of amusing kitty pictures from the game.\nCons:\nThe difficulty spike. Holy carp the difficulty spike. Up until level thirteen, it is a game that is not incredibly easy, but simple enough. From level thirteen onward, the levels become brutal, and each one somehow manages to outdo the last. While some people might like the difficulty, it is such a jump from the easier levels that it is a very rude awakening.\nEach stage has a number, but there are no names for the levels. This makes it difficult to remember which level is which. There is at least a grouping system of "locations" on the map. However, that only helps so much.\nArcade mode is insane to beat. While that may be great for hardcore gamers, it means completing the game fully is ridiculously difficult. More likely than not this game will never leave its "Beaten" status in my backloggery.\nOverall experience:\n\nI came for the kitties. I came back for the gameplay. I had no idea I was such a closet arcade shooter nerd, yet here we are. If you have any interest at all in difficult games of this genre, it is a near guarantee that Aqua Kitty - Milk Mine Defender will be a great game for your library.\n\nRating:\n\n8.5/10. It looks adorable, yet is hard enough to give almost anyone a run for their milk. So what are you waiting for? Go play this game right meow!\n\nLooking for more great indie games?

At level 10 I had to retry alot, it became tedious and annoying. And it stayed like that till the end... there is little incentive to go on, compared to the tedious retrying that is necessary for most of the later levels.\n\nThere is no story, no exploration in the levels or in the world map, no persistent ship powerups worthy of that name (looking at you, turbo cannon). Progression through gradual development of player skill is usually a motivation in many difficult or "oldschool" games, but here it is negligible, the mechanics are too shallow for that, and you constantly feel weak and the powerups are only temporary. Instead of "shoot'em up", this is an "avoid'em and shoot little peas from a safe distance", because in the later levels the enemies take alot of hits to kill.\n\nEventually I finished the game on easy but apart from the endboss and the achievements, there is NOTHING happening in the game that actually gives you motivation to keep trying.\n\nAnother annoyance is the radar: it does not center on your ship. That means when you want to get your bearing in a hectic situation, you will first have to search for your own ship's position on that small radar and that costs precious time when the main screen is full of enemies and their bullets. It forces you to keep your eyes on the radar and off the main screen for longer than necessary. You often loose health because of that, and it always feels frustrating.","January 12","false","4.8"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","11","15","0","5"

I got this game for free for reviewing purposes >\n\nI'm Not a cat person but I sure love this game.\n\nIt reminds me of the old Retro Arcade games I used to play, And this one is undersea, which is weird because cat don't like water.\n\nThe game-play, You get power-ups to buff up your submarine And health pickups to .. you know .. heal, And a bomb power-up that auto explodes when picked up to clear the area.\n\nThe main goal is to not die (Duh) and defend those little kitties that are working the Milk Miners from being abducted.\nDiscover more enemies as you move further in map, Defend 1,2 or 3 milk miners it differs between levels, and a Boss fight at the last level.\n\n25 Levels in 3 Modes.\nEasy - Normal - Arcade.\nI don't think I need to explain the first two, But Arcade mode is PermaDeath mode, Try to finish the 25 levels without dying once, Its the only one you get gems as money to use to purchase upgrades or heal your ship.\nAnd an extra level Infinite Espresso which is an endless survival game but you have no Kitties to defend, Just fend for yourself.\n\n\nPros :\n1 - Wonderful designed game, Very cool soundtrack, Animations And Effects.\n2 - Addictive Style, That comes with achievements and trading cards and a leaderboard system for all 4 modes of the game.\n3 - A challenging game and a blast to play with a local coop buddy.\n4 - I really liked this feature when a kitty is being abducted when it says ( Meow ) To alert you, The sound comes from its place so by listening to my headphone I can tell where to go left or right without having to look at the Radar.\n\nCons :\n1 - Its the type of game that will keep showing you controller buttons even if you are using a keyboard.\n2 - Has no re-definable keys and the game kinda needs it for a keyboard user because the base ones are not that good.\n3 - Forcing 1280x720 resolution is okay in the game it looks good but while using over-lay to chat it looks a bit blurry in my 1366x768 native resolution.\n4 - It felt like some levels are waaaay much harder than the more advanced levels  > as in level 10 being 5 times harder than level 15 ( my numbers are not accurate because I forgot which but you get the idea )\n\nThe butter of the review :\nA Very colorful Retro Arcade game, Even if you're a dog person you'd still love this game, Its fun and challenging and gives you time to grind for achievements and The Endless survival map.\nRecommending this for all you Retro shooting Lovers out there who'd love to get an adorable fun game like this.\n\nAverage Completion Time :\nI'd say around 2-3 hours to finish normal mode maybe less on easy mode.\nAnd it depends on you on how long it takes to finish Arcade mode because its quite hard.\nAnd endless hours to get a leadboard ranking and to show how far can you reach in Survival.\n\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group\n\nCheck out the Original Network Groups.

Also the BGM isn't superspecial, it's just all solid and nice music. It's not the type of game that I'd play for days in and out, I just like to play an hour or two and later in the week go back to it and play it again.\n\nI personally haven't tried the easy setting because I like the normal one. You have the exact proper amount of difficulty in my opinion like that, challenging yet not insanely hard. Sometimes you have to play levels a couple of times before you succeed to decide the most simplest of things by example to clear left or right first. There's also a nice variety of enemies that play into the strategy part of the game, by example exploding enemies that you want to setup near high hp enemies so you blow them up more easily. You have your enemies that drop powerups with different variety in them but controlable by shooting them at the correct time with the color of the powerup you want. Besides all this there's also an Arcade mode for a little bit of variety but it's still in essence the same game.\n\nThe game isn't a Triple-A masterpiece with engaging storylines and immense plot-twists, it's a nice and simple shoot-em-up that sometimes looks like a bullethell kindof game when you messup and leave too many enemies on the screen.\n\nI haven't tried to play this with local co-op so I'm not able to judge that. I have tried it by myself, and it seems to work fine.\n\nIn spirit of the game I'd rate it 7 out of 10 milk miners, and think it's worth it's price.","July 8, 2015","true","2.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kerean/recommended/263880/","kerean","ウジ CARRiON 死神","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kerean/","31 products in account","A hard but fair arcade retro styled Shoot 'Em Up.\nAqua Kitty is easy to pick up and play, but hard to master. Classic arcade difficulty even on the easy mode, so if you're seeking a casual game I'd advise you to look elsewhere.\n\nYou move left and right, shoot incoming waves of enemies, and protect your milk mining kitties from being abducted. If you lose all of them or die it's game over. There are three modes of play in Aqua Kitty, and these are "easy mode", "normal mode" and "arcade mode". In easy and normal mode the game will throw power ups at you to keep things fair. Failure in these two particular game modes lets you keep your progress and jump into any level you've already completed. In arcade mode however you're expected to get through the whole game on one life, and once you die it's back to square one. In this mode you have to collect gems to purchase your upgrades instead.\n\nThere are two main attack modes. Your main blaster with unlimited ammo and decent range, and your turbo blaster with better range and damage but it sucks up power which slowly regenerates. The more you progress in the game, the more your power bar gets upgraded.\n\nThere are 25 levels in total, and taking into consideration how difficult this game can be, I'd say it's a decent length even if you choose to only get through it on one mode. There is also an endless waves gameplay mode where you don't have to protect any kitties but instead just survive for as long as you can.\n\nLearning to menuvar carefully, and learning the enemy attack patterns is key to success. The number of different power ups you can get is decent and can be mixed and matched together to form deadly firepower combinations. There is also a bomb you can deploy upon picking it up and health pickups to replenish your health, which is 5 hearts/hits total. Besides these last two they are all timed powerups unless you're in arcade mode, in which case you can actually continue upgrading the powerups and keep them all the way to the end of the game.\n\nThe keyboard controls are decent, but I preferred using my gamepad. Both are perfectly functional however. Unfortunately changing controls is somewhat unintuitive for both. There is a local co-op mode available to play with a partner if you so choose.\n\nThe graphics are excellent. The sprite artwork shows off lots of color, detail and cute kitties. All the enemies are distinct even amidst the chaos, as is your ship. All the projectiles are distinct as well, and this is an all around pleasant game to look at. Fullscreen is restricted to 720p however, which I don't agree with. Otherwise, looks great and is functional on a gameplay level too.\n\nThe sound is minimal, but it gets the job done. Hearing a chain of explosions is satisfying. Otherwise you'll mostly be hearing your blasters and various kitties meowing when in danger. There is not a big enough selection of music in my opinion, but what is here is very good. Reminds me of the Sega Genesis days. If you enjoy the 8-bit retro style of music you'll enjoy this game's small selection.\n\nStory is minimal and for the most part, unimportant. The kitten's supply of milk is running dry, and you must defend them as they mine for more. Eventually you find that mice are stealing the milk to turn it into cheese. Cute but only serving a very basic backdrop. (Also cats grow lactose intolerant after weaning, just sayin')\n\nOverall, if you're seeking a challenging but fair shoot 'em up then Aqua Kitty is a fantastic choice. If, however, you're looking for something to breeze through or something more casual I suggest looking elsewhere, as this game may just end up frustrating you with its oldschool arcade difficulty. I enjoyed Aqua Kitty very much personally, and will recommend it to any fans of the genre!","April 24","true","7.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

You shoot enemies that are way more powerful than you over and over and rush back and forth between two defenseless cats that keep getting scooped up like week old clumping litter. Every now and then you can get a bomb that destroys all enemies in a small area (and if you got to the bomb without dying the enemies are probably all elsewhere anyway) or extra firepower for a very brief time. It would have been a lot better with more meaningful variety in both enemies, power-ups and level design. It easily could have been so much more than what it is.\n\nIt was included in the lowest tier ($1 for three games) of a recent Humble Bundle, so I can't say I wasted my money at roughly 33 cents out of the $4 I paid. (Though I never got the Steam trading card drops. Could have sworn I got them with previous Humble Bundle purchases.) But it's ridiculously overpriced on Steam, even on sale. $2.79? $6.99 normally? Please. It'd be decent as a free online Flash game or maybe $2 tops, as that's probably what I would have put into it in an arcade at 25 cents a play before realizing there are a lot better games out there.","June 21, 2015","false","2.4"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","7","12","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/belannaer/recommended/263880/","belannaer","Belannaer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/belannaer/","706 products in account","I gave the game an another try today since I missed the arcade mode. I was disappointed to the game as "arcade shooter with branching campaign" made me expect a game like some of the old arcade shooters such as Gradius or U.N Squadron and similar ones. In these games each level is side-scrolling level with various enemies and usually a big boss at the end. In this game the "campaign" is not that. Each level is the same, with no bosses and they don't have the side-scrolly feeling as the map just wraps around from the edges.\n\nIn each level you have varying amount of milk mines, which you have to baby sit and kill enemies. New enemies are introduced every now and then. The "branching campaign" is just choice between couple different levels, which in the end are just different amount of waves of different types of enemies. Playing through the levels get quite repeatative, very quickly.\n\nUpgrades in the game are just temporary time based power-ups you pick up and in arcade mode you can buy the same upgrades during the levels and they stay between levels. You also earn upgrades in campaign mode for progressing through the levels. I was hoping for more detailed leveling/upgrading system, similar to U.N Squadron or Tyrian 2000 with different types of weapons and ships.\n\nBut all of these things I whine about are because I was expecting things from the game based on my ideas of what "arcade shooter" should have been. It is a solid game and I'm sure some people enjoy the game as is but it's not for me.\n\nThe art style is great and I enjoy the silly cat aspect of it. Soundtrack of the game is really amazing if you like chiptune music like I do. It was the first thing that caught my eye about the game. The game has 8 tracks, levels 1-5, title screen music, level select and extra music. If you consider this game as buying a 8 track chiptune music album with an arcade shooter as a bonus then it's probably worth a purchase, especially during a sale.","February 17, 2014","false","1.3"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","12","22","0","3"

The return of 16 bit gaming that seems pretty unabrasive.  These devs did a nice job capturing that retro pixel art and arcade style gameplay and brought it to an underwater environment that keeps you more than busy.\n\nThis game is a 2D continual side scrolling shooter that is underwater.  Continual... meaning; you leave one side of the screen and you come in from the other.  The entire underwater environment is a bit long so you kind of don't go off screen until you've traveled a few screen lengths.  Once you've got this navigation down, the game will come better to you.  Sometimes you need to calculate the quickest route to save your miner and sometimes the quickest route is to simply go off the screen to the other side. You don't want to get in the habit of chasing enemies when you can simply turn around and get another and wait for that enemy you were chasing to go off the screen and come in from the other side and now he's headed toward you.  Watching your mini-map is key here.\n\nYou play as a kitty in a submarine protecting your milk miners on the bottom of the ocean.  There are various power ups and enemies to deal with while you're protecting your miners on the bottom of the ocean from being taken.  You fight your enemies in waves that get progressively harder with progressively different enemies to fight. Three game modes; 'easy', 'normal', and 'arcade'.  I prolly would have went with 'norma'l and 'hard' so players don't feel like they're wimping out by playing the 'easy' mode.  Normal is pretty hard in the upper levels so I don't know why they didn't but maybe they intend on releasing some DLC that has a new game mode for 'hard'core players or something (*hint *hint devs)\n\nMy only real criticism of the game would be that I'd like to see better contrast coloring with the stuff you can avoid colliding with and the stuff you don't have to worry about colliding with.  They do a good job with the power ups because they almost flash glow but when you're watching everything on the screen at the same time... and you have to avoid enemy fire and enemy ships but not worry about colliding with any explosions, your milk mine or the miners.  Then sometimes there are extra 'helper' subs in the area and they move up and down.  These subs block your fire hindering you from saving your miner but mysteriously you can't collide with these subs.  The background has some foreground objects to give the game some 3D feel but you can't collide with this stuff either.  It just adds confusion as to what you can avoid and what you have to watch out for in a game you're just learning.  It's not a problem on lower levels but as you progress it gets hectic and it would help if it were a bit more obvious as to what you can move through and what will kill you.  I know as I play I'll get used to what's there and what I don't have to worry about... but it's a learning curve for a game where everything is moving and I think it could be fixed with different coloring.\n\nI had no problems playing the game with my gamepad.  Nice enjoyable game.  Buy on sale.","July 11, 2014","true","5.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You're in charge of defending kitties that are mining milk from the ocean floor.\n\nYou're in charge of a submarine, which is equipped with a basic gun, allowing you to take out incoming enemies. These enemies either serve to destroy the submarine or capture the mining kittens. All of these enemies are some sort of robotic sealife. For example, robotic jellyfish will attempt to pick up your mining kittens and bring them above the surface of the water, where they'll be lost forever.\n\nThe game's levels are spread out over a rather small world map, quite disappointing seeing the small amount of levels available, wish there were more. The game gets progressively more difficult, as one might expect. The game gets really intense around the 10th or so level and I found it really difficult to progress around this time.\n\nThe game does have some rather lovely pixelated graphics and an amazing soundtrack going for it, but the price is $7, which seems a bit high for the low amount of content offered. Maybe $4 might have been better?\n\nI can recommend the game purely from its gameplay and soundtrack, but the lack of graphical options is a bit of a pain for me, especially considering the fact that the game maxes out at 1280x720, which is not acceptable in 2014.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cjx6Q8yCRME","February 17, 2014","true","0.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You have to stop those evil enemies from kidnapping your underwater cats at milk factories :) You have normal adventure mode and also arcade mode. The main difference is that in arcade mode you unlock more upgrades to your ship but when you die that is it. In normal mode you get those upgrades for a limited time from specific enemies and once boss is beaten you get more regenerative "bullets" to your secondary weapon.\n\nI do recommend this to anyone who likes games like this, i have been playing this pretty much in few days. Few things i do miss though. The ability to upgrade your ship in normal mode, there could have been great potential to add this feature but that is almost the only thing worth complaining from me. So if you are looking for nice arcade shootemup which even has local co-op, give it a try!","March 21, 2014","true","26.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kevdeck/recommended/263880/","kevdeck","Kzon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kevdeck/","269 products in account","I recently discovered and fell in love with this game. I'm going to explain why Luuthian's negative review wrong:\n\nI'm going to agree with his good points:\n|Good:\n|- Great pixel art\n|- Decent amount of levels/content for an arcade style game and the price.\n|- Very easy to learn and control.\nand add:\n- Excellent music\n- Multiple difficulty levels, (but even easy is not casual easy.) on easy mode you have more starting life, less enemies spawn and they shoot less bullets\n- Extremely polished gameplay for its genre.\n\nNow to review his bad points:\nBad:\n|-Geared heavily towards luck, too little towards skill. The advantage of bullet hell shooters is that there are patterns and expectations. Players can develop skills based on what they learn from patterns. Not so here: enemy positions are randomized which creates a ton of frustration. One game you'll have red jellies congregated in one area, another game you'll be frantically rescuing the cats one after another.\n~ He is correct about enemy positions being random, and this is good because it's demands the player to develop skill. Enemy behavior is VERY not random. Meaning, the better you understand you enemies, they faster you can take them down.\n\n|- The player is woefully underequipped to combat the majority of enemies. They absorb a stupid amount of bullets and the power ups, except the two extra cats and the bomb, are faily useless.\n~ This is completly false. Half of the enemies take one hit from the blaster, and then strongest enemy takes 5 shots from your missle, which can come out in less than two seconds. While I sort of agree that the powerups seem sort of useless at first, in later stages in the game they are almost essential to be strategically used to reach then next level.\n\n|- Half the nemies are programmed to dive out of the way of your vehicle. This may sound interesting at first, until you realize how much time you're spending chasing enemies that randomly move out of the way of your already underpowered weapons.\n~ This is an exaggeration. There are three enemies that dodge you when you approach. And they slightly dodge and then stay put. It's nothing like the green cell mass enemies in geometry wars. OP was just careless.\n\n|- Difficulty essentially equates to dumping increasing amounts of enemies around the screen randomly, often before you've even finished a particular wave of foes.\n~ This is true, but not bad, as being able to clear waves quickly give you a clear atvantage.\n\n|- The foreground art will regularily cover enemies and bullets making navigating around the map incredibly annoying and, again, make your survival a lucky happenstance.\n~ I personally never noticiced anything like this.\n\n|- Bullet travel length is based on the direction and speed you travel, amking moving forward actual disadvantagous in most situations, despite moving being what you need to do to survive.\n~ This is incorrect. From my observation bullet length is a set distance and speed from the player. It just seems slower because it doest accellerate when the player is moving forward.\n\n|- Balancing looking up at the alarm and surviving while doding bullets is way too much to handle. There should have been any easy indicator or red arrow to show a cat is being abducted and the quickest way too them. I can't count how many cats I lost simply because the game expects you to juggle way too much visual information at once with so little direction.\n~ Apparently this reviewer just doesn't like arcade game, because the balance of saving the kitties and dodging and fighting a lot of what what makes this game. The game does have an indicator that he mentioned, two actually. One,  with stereo speaker the kitty will cry out when captured from the audio channel left or right that is closest to you. There is also a map on screen showing the player of all ships that capture your crew.\n\nThere you have it. That's my criticism of the review. In terms of arcade shooter, I would say that this is one of the most balanced and fair ones made in the last 10 years. There is not an insane amount of bullets and bullet speed is very dodgable. Agility in movement and accuracy in shot is highly rewarded, meaning the better you skill the better you do. They game will keep pusing you to develop new strategies to protecting your operation and taking out the enemy. The game also encourages you when you retry levels, removing frustration.\n\nMaybe the only negative I would say is not having a casual mode for players like Luuthian who can't handle a challenge. For everyone else, this game is EXCELLENT, in it genre.","June 23, 2015","true","36.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

That being said, don't let the kitty theme lull you into a false sense of security; this game is quite hard.\n\nThe game's graphics and gameplay are extremely crisp and enjoyable, and the music is definitely not something to put aside either. The scoring system works quite well too, as it offers more points to players who are able to perform the most efficiently, giving Aqua Kitty's online highscore competition a lot of relevance. Because of this, there's a fair bit of replay value to be enjoyed, but it can get a bit repetitive and stale after you've fought the same groups enemies over and over.\n\nAs I mentioned above, Aqua Kitty is hard. While there is an easy mode for those who might not be up for the challenge, the normal and arcade modes are quite difficult and will tax even a shmup veteran's skill. Most of the difficulty is justified, but in some cases (such as the Infinite Espresso mode - the game's endless level), the screen will end up being filled with more high-health enemies than you have firepower to deal with. This is to be expected at some point because of the scaling difficulty, but it often happens relatively early in Espresso runs, which boils down to a slight problem with enemy balancing.\n\nOverall, if you're a shmup fan or you enjoy the gameplay similar to the 1980 arcade classic, Defender, Aqua Kitty is certainly worth picking up. Just don't delude yourself into thinking the game's going to take it easy on you.","February 26, 2014","true","4.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

As far as action goes it's good, but doesn't offer much in the way of powerups. There's also a higher powered attack that has a limited meter that rebuilds over time, but I haven't found this to be effective at all.\n\nOn the positive, the graphics consist of SNK style sprites, but is pretty simplistic otherwise. This is not to say it's bad though as the graphics and character art is really cute, and there's plenty on screen at time. Additionally, the core gameplay is overall fun and gives variations to the waves of enemies and what type you're facing.\n\nBut the one nagging problem that I find is it's difficulty. It's a bit difficult at times, and not for reasons that I feel are based on challenge or skill, which I'm fine with. I think more games need to bring back that traditional challenge.\n\nHowever, the challenge from this game comes from the interface and level layout. You don't see the entire level on screen at once, including some of your miners that you have to protect. The only way you know if someone's going after your off screen miners when you can't see them is an audiable call from the cat miner and a blinking dot on a map at the top of your screen. However the action is on the bottom half of the screen, meaning that you have to move your eyes off of the level for a moment to see if someone's coming after your miner, which is a distraction that can cause you to be hurt and killed by an enemy fish. This adds a challenge that is hard for you to control, which isn't the good kind of challenge that I like.\n\nDespite this, The amount of levels and variety involved I feel is good and this flaw doesn't hamper it so much as to be truly infuriating. In the end I think on sale it's definitley worth checking out, at full price I might hesitate to recommend but still recommend it.\n\nTo see more gamplay, check out my let's play of Aqua Kitty - Milk Mine Defender https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWhsBkW5uXc","July 8, 2015","true","0.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Today (3/2/16) I finally got around to playing it.  I thought it was okay!  The gameplay seemed spot-on for what the game was aiming to present, the music was a nice fit, the gameplay provided a challenge and the concept was a ridiculous bonus.\n\nHowever, while I was playing, my antivirus/etc program notified me there was a threat detected in the game files, claiming that it required action, which required me to stop everything to take that action and wonder if there was now something wrong with my PC.\n\nAccording to devs and other people on the forums, the game can create false positives, likely due to coding.\nOriginally posted by Tikipod:Hi - yes sorry some antivirus detect the exe as a false positive - I think it relates to how we obfuscated the game exe. Apologies for any inconvenience caused.\nAs silly as "Aqua Kitty - Milk Mine Defender" happens to be, it seems to be a game I would be willing to play.  The guessing game of "what threats from expendable programs am I willing to tolerate" is not a game I'm willing to play. I'm not willing to excuse companies toying with my PC or that of other consumers, willingly adding code that attempts to sidestep security or safety measures.  I'm not prepared to make excuses on a company's behalf when conflicts regarding security are known and remain unresolved.\n\nI'll try to keep an eye on whether or not the game updates and fixes things.  I intend to change this review accordingly if it does.\n\nEDIT, 3/3/16: I decided to listen to the OST before I forgot.  I've been cautious about hype around OSTs, but there's definitely stuff in there that I loved and/or considered catchy[electric-cafe.bandcamp.com].  The OST had also been included in the game bundle I purchased, and some of it exists in the game files.  At this point I have no regrets about the game besides the fact I'm not playing it.  Things that trip up antivirus programs are generally a deal-breaker to me.","March 2","false","1.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The action is fast paced, especially later on, and the difficulty gets pretty brutal deep into the campaign. I liked the sound effects and music, though I'm having trouble remembering any of them a month since playing the game. Overall the design is very minimalistic, with one main attack and one super attack that refills over time. This works though, as you can dive in quickly and not have to worry about anything but how fast you can destroy all the enemies in a given level.\n\nThis is a great game for younger gamers and does not feature any graphic (bloody) violence.

It is a retro shooter with lots of action and a quite decent difficulty level. Featuring a great two player co-op mode it's ideal to be tackled with a buddy.\n\nSteam needs more of these simple timewasters - the game is simply fun. Aqua Kitty's gameplay is a bit repetitive but surprisingly addicting and fun in short bursts. I especially love its full controller support (for gaming on the couch) and wonderfully crafted pixel graphics. 10/10 would buy again.","September 20, 2014","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The sountrack, gameplay, difficulty, levels and the feeling of retroish. Where do I even begin?\n\nSoundtrack. Blasting 8 to 16-bit styled multilevel pixel mishmash at your ears WILL make you eargasm. My favourite track being ''Kittyrock''.\n\nGameplay. Very straight forward shoot anything at sight. You can shoot in many directions by picking up powerups and turning your submarine. This game has you doding at high speed while trying to kill robot fishes trying to steal you milk. The controlls are tight and simple. One button shoots the other ones controll you movement. The submarine turns at a dime.\n\nLevels are varied by adding tons of enemies and waves. Different strategies required to beat certain levels. Once I had to retry one stage least 10 times before feeling the sweet taste of success.\n\nFinally being the difficulty. Just enough easy and challenging. If you are a HC SHMUP fan try the arcade mode. Start normally from the beginning and play through the levels as usual, but when you die you restart from the beginning of the campaing. Also you collect gems to make upgres for your submarine.\n\nYES! YES! THIS IS DELICIOUS! 10/10","September 25, 2014","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The layout of those buttons also often causes me to turn my ship around instead of firing my big guns, and I haven't found any way to change it.\n\nThe gameplay also features a submarine that can only fire forward, and moves more slowly if you are moving "backwards" or attempting to maneuver while firing, which contributes to the game's difficulty. The mechanics work and they certainly make sense for a submarine, but they take some getting used to if you're used to other shooter environments that tend to be more free and loose.\n\nThe game is entertaining enough to hold my attention, engaging enough to make me gesture furiously at the air when I lose miners, and though it's not a personal favorite, it's certainly very good at what it does.","July 20, 2015","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In fact, true to the games of old, it comes out as a very simple and basic game with little in the way or story, upgrades or level variety.\n\nIt's a decent, fun game with a very straightforward but enjoyable gameplay and I feel it can be a worthwhile purchase for fans of the genre when on sale (around the 3$ mark): it won't last long but it'll be a nice way to remember the past.","September 12, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The action is fast paced, especially later on, and the difficulty gets pretty brutal deep into the campaign. I liked the sound effects and music, though I'm having trouble remembering any of them a month since playing the game. Overall the design is very minimalistic, with one main attack and one super attack that refills over time. This works though, as you can dive in quickly and not have to worry about anything but how fast you can destroy all the enemies in a given level.\n\nThis is a great game for younger gamers and does not feature any graphic (bloody) violence.

The game has tight controls, a good difficulty curve and is more laid back compared to other bullet hell side scrolling shooters, but still very challenging. There's good replayability thanks to the high score system and exciting gameplay. The graphics are well done and look like a high-res SNES game.

I've played the game a bit more and I do feel my initial review may have been too harsh.  The concept is cool, the graphics are pretty, and it is an all around fun shooter.  I was roughly at the half way point in the game before I felt it started becoming really difficult, so I don't think my initial criticism was fair.\n\nThe game features two difficulties and an arcade mode.  In arcade mode, you can earn power ups and keep them as you play through the stages rather than having them for only a brief time as you normally would.  The tradeoff is that death is permanent.\n\nOverall, Aqua Kitty is great fun and I do recommend it.","November 26, 2015","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

If you're not familiar with Defender at all, the premise is pretty simple: fly left or right in looping stages shooting all in your path while gaining power-ups and occasionally saving the odd human or two. Or in Aqua Kitty's case, cats.\n\nThe story is simple and silly, the graphics are bright and vibrant, and the music is amazing. So what about the gameplay? Well, if you like Defender you're set. The controls are responsive, the shooting is satisfying, and the difficlty ramps nicely. There are plenty of different enemies to defeat so the game never becomes repetitive. It's a tad short, but with three difficulty settings and an Endless Mode, there's plenty of replayability.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed this game. If quirky arcade shooters are your thing, this is the game for you.","February 3","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/serpentstare/recommended/263880/","serpentstare","serpentstare","http://steamcommunity.com/id/serpentstare/","128 products in account","Aqua Kitty is basically a cute and challenging classic arcade style side-scrolling shooter with a core element of base defense.\n\nIf that sounds good to you, I don't have any trouble recommending it.\n\nPros:\nCute, friendly, self-consistant aesthetic\nVariety of enemies with different powers\nResponsive controls and good stability\nDecent sound and music\n\nCons:\nLimited arsenal\nUnfriendly to keyboard users\n\nHonestly when I think about it my biggest complaint is that even if you're using a keyboard, all the game's visible button prompts are for controller buttons, which can be an obstacle in learning the controls. The layout of those buttons also often causes me to turn my ship around instead of firing my big guns, and I haven't found any way to change it.\n\nThe gameplay also features a submarine that can only fire forward, and moves more slowly if you are moving "backwards" or attempting to maneuver while firing, which contributes to the game's difficulty. The mechanics work and they certainly make sense for a submarine, but they take some getting used to if you're used to other shooter environments that tend to be more free and loose.\n\nThe game is entertaining enough to hold my attention, engaging enough to make me gesture furiously at the air when I lose miners, and though it's not a personal favorite, it's certainly very good at what it does.","July 20, 2015","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
