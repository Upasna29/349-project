"http://steamcommunity.com/id/irishcream/recommended/207730/","irishcream","Whiskey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/irishcream/","718 products in account","I saw this on sale for 99 cents and when a game is that cheap, unless the offends your ancestors in some deep and unforgivable way, you buy it. I, like many others on steam, bought this simply because it's this cheap. The 90% off sale is the "we're not making any more money from this" sale last ditch attempt to produce some revenue from a title.  Considering I haven't heard of this rather generic looking, what appears to be some sort of RTS game, I wasn't expecting much and I wasn't surprised in so many ways.\n\nArena Wars 2 is a top down real-time strategy game that pits you against a player or an AI component in what is essentially a match of capture the flag. This is a "first-impression" review as I am honestly unwilling to put more than the hour and 20 minutes I put into this game. The gameplay is very mediocre and the units in the game are fairly uninspired. The game seems to be a "rock paper scissors" game in the sense that one unit is clearly designed to defeat another particular unit. Unfortunately this concept I felt was implented poorly as one unit will do more damage to another unit seemingly abritrarily and it lacks the thougthfulness of a mature RTS game.\n\nThere is no tutorial or any intro missions to introduce each of the mechanics so the player is thrown in to engage in a trail and error process of figuring everything out.\n\nTo this game's merit, I do like the idea. This game is designed to get he player in the action right away and matches will end quickly whereas a full RTS game might include 2 hours of base-building prior to any combat. A match or two of this game could be played on a lunch break.\n\nThis game is an online game but seeing how this game doesn't have a consistent playerbase this is effectively a single player game. There are several difficulty levels and in my first hour and 20 minutes it took getting to the hardest difficulty level to experience any sort of challenge. One very annoying aspect is that these difficulty levels need to be unlocked *per level* and there are five of them. This means that for each level I want to play on, I need to suffer through four matches of boring before I get to the very average gameplay.\n\nI noticed a bug where an area-of-effect ability hits the wreck of a tower it will register damage and repeat "Turret destroyed" - there may be more bugs but finding this so readily underlines this game's overall lack of polish.\n\n\n\nThe idea has some merit but I cannot recommend this title for any price. The real cost of a game your own freetime anyway.\nScore 4/10","December 9, 2013","false","1.4"," 168 of 222 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","168","222","2","5"

The game offers little strategic involvement as spamming units over and over is an easy task in this game. Games only last about ten minutes and can be quite boring at times. Graphical wise, the game isn't that pleasing the eyes, but does have good explosion effects I will give it that. Overall it shouldn't be purchased at full price, I got it for .99 cents and gotr my moneys worth out of it, but make sure you have a friend with it if you do buy it!

Though the towers lend themselves to only a few winning strats.\n\nWhat I was not so keen on:\n* Farming power ups and XP on the sides took away some of the promise of "Fast Paced" promise.\n* Generator concusion blast is too strong. Something that does less damage would be fine, or at least draw out the concussion line around the base so defenses can be set accordingly.\n* Unit roles are not diverse enough to stop what would inevitably be a battle of attrition. (Whoever upgrades the Destroyers first will take out the turrets and eventually win)\n* No creeps do make the game seem "Quiet" now and then unless you are taking the action to the other player.\n","July 13, 2014","false","0.6"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","1"

It has reasonable graphics and simple game mechanics.  Build units, clobber enemy units and then steal and capture enemy resources.  If you are looking for a short fast paced strategy game this one should suffice.  It feels more like an arcade game than like a strategy game.  Nothing special, but fun to play.","April 23, 2014","true","0.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Unfortunately it's not worth much more than that.  Has great graphics, UI, and physics.  Where it's lacking is in gameplay.  It's extremely basic.  Probably great for a little kid, it's not for adults.  If they marketed it that way it would be better.  I love the capture the flag element to the game.  Hate flag auto returns though even in FPS CTF I hated auto returns.  Game could be so much better and sell more if they put more work into making it more strategic, allowing more units on the field (units cost much less).  Then you'd have a really good game because the CTF aspect is really great.  The different power ups are nice but they rarely help a lot.  Would be nice to see more power ups and ways to get them.  For the cost... can't complain just a little disappointing that this game has so much potential that isn't being developed.","December 16, 2013","true","0.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

All hardware requirements were exceeded, let alone met, yet it would literally never finish loading, always crashing around 80%.\n\nI got to a friend's house and he had it on his computer.  So I told him about my problem, and he allowed me to play his.  It worked on his, in case you couldn't guess.  The gameplay did keep me busy, which is really all I ask for in a game, but it just failed to meet my expectations.\n\nThe level designs weren't really creative, the combat is a little dull, and the controls and actions were...  Anyway, if you need something to pass the time, this should meet that requirement.  I bought it when it was on sale for $1, and for the price, I would say it was worth it (if it did work, but I won't judge it based on that).  Would I buy it at full price?  Never.  Would I play it if it worked?  Probably.  I don't have any other RTS or Strategy games.\n\nMy final review- Dull, yet passes the time.  5.2/10","December 24, 2013","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

All hardware requirements were exceeded, let alone met, yet it would literally never finish loading, always crashing around 80%.\n\nI got to a friend's house and he had it on his computer.  So I told him about my problem, and he allowed me to play his.  It worked on his, in case you couldn't guess.  The gameplay did keep me busy, which is really all I ask for in a game, but it just failed to meet my expectations.\n\nThe level designs weren't really creative, the combat is a little dull, and the controls and actions were...  Anyway, if you need something to pass the time, this should meet that requirement.  I bought it when it was on sale for $1, and for the price, I would say it was worth it (if it did work, but I won't judge it based on that).  Would I buy it at full price?  Never.  Would I play it if it worked?  Probably.  I don't have any other RTS or Strategy games.\n\nMy final review- Dull, yet passes the time.  5.2/10","December 24, 2013","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
