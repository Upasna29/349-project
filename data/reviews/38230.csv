I actually feel like I have been mugged by the developers of this game. The HD update has rendered the game completely unplayable as the main screen turns into a bizarre white glow so that nothing is visible. Such a shame as this game is so much fun.\n\nSeeing as this has been the case now for nearly 6 months (since the HD update) and the developers have done NOTHING to rectify the situation, I am not holding my breath for a fix anytime soon.\n\nStay away.","September 13, 2015","false","0.6"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","14","17","3","0"

First of all it would just crash on start up so run as Admin.\nThen I run the game and I get a glowing white screen! So I goto graphics options to see what I can do. I decide to put graphics up to high and turn off the glowing effect. There's 2 options to switch off for glowing effect.\n\n\nFor some reson what I did completly messed up the game and crashed everytime on start up. So I give up. A few months lather I re-install my OS and decid to try it one more time. It worked! but I still had a glowing white screen! So I carfully changed the glow settings (dynamic lighting or somthing) and everythhing seems to run ok!\n\nFrom what I gather the graphics settings are saved seperate to the actual Hotel Giant install root folder (It was for me!) meaning that even a re-install of the game would not reset the games graphics  settings to default. Leaving me with graphics settings that crashed the game and unable to change back.\n\nNormally these settings are saved in a text file somewhere, so If anyone else is having these problems maybe your graphics settings are causing it and the only fix is to find that file to manually edit (which strangly is not in the Hotel Giant install directory nor Steam/apps/common/HotelGiant2) or re-install OS (which is a bit overkill just to get this crap game to work)\n\nThis is just terrible and to me this code is all broken. They released an update a few months back and this was not even touched upon?","September 16, 2015","false","0.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

For you, life is cheap and your hourly rates are cheaper. Little by little you slowly devour customers and their possessions until you reach critical mass, allowing you to bribe hotel officials and pushing you up a star rating.\n\nUpon reaching a grand total of fire stars, the hotel drops the pretence of accommodation and uproots itself from its earthly bounds and begins rampaging through a downtown of your choosing.\n\nThis is where the game really flys off the deep end interms of balance and replayability. Sure its cool watching a Novatel claw its way up the Chrysler building and swat angrily at bi-planes, but after the first time it gets fairly stale.\n\nThe controls are dodgy and sluggish (You're a fifteen story hotel, I guess it was intended) and the concept is frankly ridiculously.\n\n\nI got it for a buck.
