It's a nifty space shooter with a side of RPG elements, and for what it is, it's actually a great wee game. Given the disappointments in the genre that are available today, going back to titles like this is actually kinda refreshing.","May 14, 2014","true","224.1"," 50 of 52 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","50","52","0","1"

The just slightly campy (and lovably so) story is told well, too.\n\nWhile some games in this genre focus on getting the next ship, "Darkstar One" is all about making one ship work for you. It's a slightly different take on the formula, and it's a good one. Also, the game is pretty forgiving, which is nice when similar titles can be "brickwall difficult" experiences.\n\nI was actually quite surprised with how engaging "Darkstar One" turned out to be.

While space battles are well done, fun, and with good physics, it does get boring somewhat quickly. The main missions and side quests can be interesting as it progresses through the storyline, but it does not give you a feeling of great accomplishment as you go through them. The trading aspect of the game can and might as well be ignored completely. It provides you with minimal profits in comparison to the other means to acquire credits. Speaking of credits, I completed the game with 8.5 million credits in my possession. After a while, the amount of credits you accumulate will become obsolete, as you will have more than enough to get whatever you want. The game suffers from extreme repetitiveness, which also creates tedium and dullness when you do the same two or three activities over, and over, and over, and over. Simply put, the game is about 20 hours too long. The developers should have been more concise and implemented more diverse aspects in more ways than just this. The end game is surprisingly bland and unexciting. Also, throughout the game, you are given a false sense of freewill. Your progress is almost completely linear.\n\nDarkstar One is good.","March 20, 2014","true","31.5"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","20","21","0","0"

The learning curve is hardly a curve at all (if you are able to get on good terms with relativity of direction), and it will keep you going for a while.\n\nHowever, at the time of writting this, 7 hours in, it's becoming more and more apparent just how repetitive this game becomes, and offers you no replay value. The missions are all pretty much the same ("Go there, kill things") and it turns into an incredible grind fest if you're a completionist like me. Eliminating all the gangs, liberating the systems, flying through asteroids for upgrades and a silly sidequest now and then that is even more repetitive if that's even possible.\n\nThe game would also like to suggest that there are multiple ways of making money and choosing different paths and sure, there are indeed multiple branches that you can gain reputation in, to become a Merchant or a Smuggler, a Mercenary or a Pirate, a Killer or a Bounty Hunter...\n\nWell, except that Merchant and Smuggler are the same thing with a slight risk and much larger reward for Smuggler, Mercenary and Bounty Hunter are just you shooting the bad guys, Pirate is you shooting the good guys and stealing their stuff to sell for Mercenary or Smuggler, and Killer is the same thing except you shoot to kill. So really, not much of difference at all.\n\nAnd even though there are indeed dozens and dozens of systems to explore, there really isn't a reason to. It's all the same anyway, slight differences here and there (image of a planet in the background, number of objects, possible sidemission/collectible (that you can see and check news stand about locations of beforehand)), but other than that, you're probably not going to visit a lot of systems for more than a few seconds while your jump drive recharges.\n\n\nAnyway, to wrap it all up, I would only suggest this game if you want to play a space shooter. If you're looking for a trader game, I would suggest you look at other Kalypso titles, as the trading system isn't really all that great here. If you're looking for something you can pick up and play casually whenever you feel like blowing some space ships up, this is the game for you.","August 15, 2015","true","8.3"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","21","24","0","1"

Kept me playing for 9 hours (so far). That's not bad for £6 (I actually got it in the sale for less, but I would have been happy even if I'd paid the full price). Fly around space, shoot space pirates (or become one), be a mercenary or a trader transporting resources between systems to make money, do odd jobs for people etc... Think if X2/X3 had a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child with an arcade machine...\n\nGraphically it's not bad, actually looks quite nice considering it was released 8 years ago. Some of the backdrops are brilliant, an effect only slightly let down by the special effects and textures (which to be fair aren't bad, but nothing special today either).\n\nThe bad? The voice acting is terrible (so just like most other games in this genre), the story is painful, and the cut scenes look like they belong on a PS1/N64. Also it doesn't capture your mouse, so if you use more than one monitor you will occasionally find yourself clicking on the wrong screen and making the game drop to desktop (disabling the screen in your graphics card control panel fixes it, there may be another fix I haven't bothered looking). Game's crashed twice on me in 9 hours, pretty sure it was to do with the multi screen problem as it hasn't happened since.\n\nIf you can look past the voice acting (as any fan of this genre has to be able to do), and ignore the low res cutscenes (of which there aren't many anyway), then this is fun.\n\n\n\nUpdate: 16 hours... It's more fun than sim, and Turrets are totally OP: my first turret is a lvl 3 railgun turret - every time I get in a fight I hear constant fire from the turret, keep dodging, kill everything!\n\n\n\nUpdate 2: 33 hours. I am fury. I am pain. I am Death. I have blasted, burned and obliterated my way through dozens of star systems. Hundreds, maybe thousands of souls floating through the void are my responsibility. A silent testament to my rage. Pirates are afraid to even think of my name. Now my sights are set on Broniss corporation.\n\nFlying through a Broniss subturanean complex, and the lead character comes out with the single best comment in a video game of all time "These Bronies are gonna get it." So I guess that's that. Bronies beware...\n\nOne, Two, Funky's coming for you.\nThree, Four, missiles to your door.\nFive, Six, wait till you see my tricks.\nSeven, Eight, plasma burning bright.\nNine, Ten, you'll never breath again.\n\nHmmmm...

The idea of mixing RPG elements by creating an evolving ship is nice, but merely replaces the opportunity to switch spacecrafts and try out new combinations. Missions might become repetitive (and far less challenging) once you understand the basic components which they are constructed with.\n\nIf you are looking for an in-depth 4X game along the lines of X: Beyond the Frontier and its sequels, this might be too shallow for you. If you are looking for a more space combat focused game, give it a try. Do not expect the intensity of a Freelancer or Freespace, but at least it might still the hunger until a next Indepence War sequel arrives.","December 29, 2013","true","43.9"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","17","18","0","0"

There were a few teething issues (Which I'll discuss below) but overall, so far (about 5 hours in) its a solid, enjoyable space combat/trading/missions game that will not disappoint fans of Elite/Freelancer etc.\n\nI had initially intended to run this on a Windows 8.1 laptop system, using my PS3 pad through the built in Xbox drivers - if you want to do this too, don't bother - it just simply doesn't work very well. I only got sporadic response from the pad before I gave in.\n\nSecondly, the game will crash if you select certain resolutions - this can be fixed using a custom resolution (just Google Darkstar One custom resolution) but it was a bind having to mess about on both my laptop AND my desktop,\n\nSince getting the game working, it's all been good. You start with a fairly basic ship and collect artifacts to upgrade it. You can pick up a variety of missions for cash, or just trade between systems if you like. Other reviewers have criticized the terrible voice acting and this is something I have to agree with - it is terrible for the most part, but the environmental speech from other pilots and space stations still adds to the atmosphere. I'm at the stage now where I've upgraded my ship three times and kitted it out with some reasonably decent gear. Blasting space pirates out of the sky is incredibly satisfying.\n\nPros at a glance:\n\nLooks nice.\nLots to do.\nEasy to pick up and easy to follow control system.\nInteresting ship upgrading system and different upgrades.\nA steal for the money being asked.\n\n\nCons at a glance:\n\nSome technical niggles.\nVoice acting is laughable.\nNo tracking of prices between space stations - back to pad and pen!\nSome missions aren't clear enough about what you are expected to do - example: I picked up an escort mission and met my wingman outside the station - I hyperspaced to the target system and failed the mission because I hadn't got close enough to the wingman for him to jump first... a bit tiresome!\n\nIf you're still reading this, you're clearly in the right place - get it bought.\n\nDG","February 5, 2015","true","4.4"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","14","15","2","1"

Having said that, this basically is Freelancer, with an upgradeable ship and horrible (I mean just atrocious) voice-acting. Seriously, I hate to let something like that ruin a game for me, but it really does. The main character sounds like Bear Grillis on Red Bull. It's really bad. It's like first season of Babylon 5 bad. Worse even.\n\nThe game itself is good, but I can only play it for a couple hours at a time or the terrible (srsly; just hideous) voice-acting starts to make me want to kill someone.\n\n[UPDATE]\nI really feel bad that I let that one thing ruin what would otherwise be a very enjoyable game, but it really is THAT BAD. I almost don't want to say it again, but I just tried to play this game again, and couldn't keep at it for more than twenty minutes. The voice acting really is that awful. I wish somebody would make a mod that replaces all the voices with professionals. Or even just people who don't think they're William Shatner or Clark Gable.\n\n[UPDATE 2]\nOkay. I FINALLY was able to get past the voice-acting. So I've played about 4 hours into the game, and... meh. I almost wish I hadn't. I was happier believing this was a pretty okay game that was just ruined by ♥♥♥♥♥♥ voice-acting. Alas, that's not the case. Imagine Freelancer, but you're locked in the cockpit view. And the economy is pointless. And the plot isn't great. And the combat is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ easy.\n\nDarkStar One is a great idea done poorly. It would kill as a mod for Freelancer (there's got to be something newer that I should be using as a reference, but X is far more complex than FL), but on it's own it's just kinda flat. You bounce around the galaxy, collecting pieces to put on your ship and shooting things. Not much here to get excited about.\n\nI can't believe I'm still writing about this game years later, but it's only recently that I feel I've given it a fair shake. So I give DS1 a "don't bother." It's not horrible, but it's really not worth taking the time to download.

After learning information on a man responsible for your father's death, you inherit a ship called Darkstar One and set on a chase across the galaxy to uncover a plot against the Galactic Union.\n\nPros: The game offers very intuitive controls that can easily be mastered by even the most novice to the genre, although difficulty might be light for a veteran. The galaxy is a large place with a huge amount of systems you gain access to as the story unfolds. Rather than changing ships, you upgrade the Darkstar One by uncovering mysterious alien artifacts hidden in asteroids or held by criminal gangs, allowing you to tailor your ship to your play style, be it hull strength & turrets, agility & firepower, or cargo & speed, but you still customize your weapons layout and special equipment to your needs.\n\nCons: The story is the worst kind of unimaginative cliché that has its place in a kid's cartoon. The game is extremely repetitive, every system feels identical except for the color scheme, as you always jump in with a single trade station always located at the same distance from the jump gate, while enemy hideouts aren't even hidden by distance or debris fields and are often blatantly identified as "bandit hideout". But you're stuck tediously landing in each of them one by one, not by interest or desire to explore, but by necessity to find the very occasional side mission that unlocks some of the systems holding artifacts, as those aren't hidden at all and you'll know exactly where to find each of them. Graphics are awful by today's standard, textures are so low resolution that space backgrounds appear to be an overstretched 80x80 bitmap. The world itself is so bland you have no interest in doing trading or contracts as you quickly make more money then you can spend.\n\nVerdict: ★★☆☆☆ - Forget it\n\nThis game is a poor attempt at replicating an open-world space game. I spent every minute of my playthrough wishing I was playing Freelancer or any other superior games in the genre. Once the game is over, the boring galaxy offers little to nothing worth visiting again, so you should probably skip this one.\n\n—————————————————————————\nThis was just my opinion.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.","April 16","false","34.3"," 21 of 35 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","21","35","0","0"

I spotted it for 2 dollars and went ahead and purchased it and I am really glad I waited.  If you are a huge space sim/shooter fan and have not given this game a try then wait for it to go on sale.  The game has some nice things about it, don't get me wrong, great controls, nice and clean ui, and a huge space to explore...but if you are hoping this game is gonna bring you a deeper experience you will be disappointed.  It is shallow in that regard.  Missions take about 2 minutes to complete, which I hope gets better as I move forward into the later parts of the game.  Trading doesn't really have any depth and I do not believe there is any mining options.  If you are in the market for a great space shooter then just stick with Freespace and Freespace 2.  If you want a mix of shooter and more freedom then go with Independence War 2.  Even Wing Commander Privateer is a great choice over this game.  I will continue to play this to the end but I can definitely say this game will not be memorable.  Play it, get whatever you can from it, and get Elite Dangerous when it releases.","July 3, 2014","false","3.2"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

Definitely worth a look into. For some odd ball reason it stopped working on my system so I uninstalled it. On almost on an urge I re-installed it and guess what? It works again! I can already know I'm going to like this game alot. If you liked Wing Commander and all games like that, this is a safe bet. My problem is I can't give it the attention I really want to. Steam overdose... Too many awesome games that come on sale too often. I've literally lost six months of my life just on Boarderlands 1 and 2. Then go Bionic Commando and Serious Sam, the list goes on and on. But this space sim fighter has everything going for it. Customizable ship and straight foward objectives and a nice touch of randomly searching areas for hidden upgrades. Graphicly I rate this game mid-way. Nothing ultra-realistic but there are no eye sores here either. Story seems hum-ho but then again I haven't really played it enough and I find gameplay more important that the story. Solid controls, solid graphics, solid sound and gameplay at a solid and reasonable price. The game didn't aim for over the top but instead aimed for enjoyable, the most important factor in video games. I've been ignoring this game lately but it's not because it's a bad game. I've just haven't been in a space fighting mood most of the time. Ever get burnt out for the high action games, ease into this one for a nice change of pace and enjoy.

Darkstar One is not a game that deviates much from the tried and true, most of the features and design direction you find in Darkstar you will also find in the older successes of the genre.\n\nYou play the game as Kayron Jarvis, a young pilot who's father was recently killed through nefarious means and you set out to discover the truth. Of course you will quickly trip over a number of large conspiracies and eventually have to save the galaxy from an evil race of aliens. That is all standard.\n\nTo aid you in this quest you have the unique and powerful spaceship "Darkstar One" at your disposal. Unlike other games in the genre you will be stuck inside this one ship for the entirety of the game. That is not to say you will be stuck with the same capabilities for the entire game. As you progress through the game you will find artifacts for your Darkstar that will allow you to upgrade your ship with additional weapons and turrets.\n\nVisually, Darkstar One looks pretty enough not to disappoint. The special effects are not overdone, and the visible part of the ship's cockpit feels gritty and natural. The design of the ships and other larger space vessels is striking at first, but it does become somewhat repetitive after a while.\n\nThe sound effects, while not top-notch were good enough to sort of blend into the gameplay seamlessly. The voice acting, on the other hand, is mysteriously void of the "acting" part. Blame it on the fact that the game was translated from German.\n\nThe biggest problem that Darkstar has by far is the fact that it simply feels like a pale copy of other, far more successful games in the genre. There is nothing in it to grab you while playing. The combat is overly simplistic after you master the controls and the story is about as engaging as the evening news. You almost get the feeling that Darkstar One was put together by people who either didn't know how to make an interesting game, or simply lacked the will to do it. Darkstar One is in need of fire and passion; it lacks the imagination and creativity needed to captivate the player. The gameplay feels flat and it becomes very tedious after a while. Even though the initial impressions may suggest differently, Darkstar One doesn't deliver the type of experience that space sim fans are looking for.\n\nIt's not a game I'd normally recommend to anyone but it just happens to be in a genre that is woefully short on quality these days so if you're fan of the genre you will probably end up playing this at some point regardless of it's faults.","December 8, 2012","true","57.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

It's slow, very repetitive, and very linear for an "open world space sim". On the other hand, the ship controls feel very nice, and the game always has something for you to do. If you don't want to pursue the main quest at the moment, you could just go kill some baddies for fun and profit. Of course, you won't be able to "level up", unless you follow the main quest, which is a bit of a bummer.\n\nLeveling up also is a bit awkward, since you don't really get anything for it, other than the ability to buy some upgrades from the local trade station. Those upgrades can cost a LOT of money, though. The game levels up the enemies along with you, so you'll never feel much more powerful than when you started the game, aside from there being more flashy bits when you hit the fire button. There's a mission toward the end that is next to impossible if you've been conscientiously upgrading your ship, though, so you might want to skip some of the upgrades until you've finished it (Flak 2).\n\nI'd say the modeler did pretty good work on this game, even though it shows its age. There's a fair variety of ships that you'll see flying around. Would have been nice to be able to pilot some of them. :) The textures are pretty bad, and sound was just ok, but voice acting was a bit cheesy.\n\nIf you like space sims, give it a shot. If you're not a fan, pass this one by.\n\nSpace sim fans: 8/10\nOthers: 5/10","September 26, 2015","true","22.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

It's very easy to jump right in as the tutorials do a good job of teaching the mechanics of the game.  It has a little bit of depth in terms of customizing your ship and whatnot but it is not overly complex.\n\nThis is not the game for people who are experienced players of the genre.  Anyone who has played many of this type of game will likely find this overly simplistic.  However, for the more casual player, it's a great deal of fun and is likely a good starting point for anyone wanting to get into the genre.  In terms of gameplay, it reminds me a bit of Freelancer (Digital Anvil/Microsoft - 2000).\n\nThe graphics and sound effects are quite good for 2006 (I don't know how the 2010 Xbox 360 version compares).  The flight mechanics, including fighting, exploration, docking, etc. are very smooth and easy to get used to.  I have read some reviews stating that it is repetitive and boring but again, that's probably from gamers who are looking for more complexity and depth that can be found in other games of the genre.\n\nTo sum up: DarkStar One is a great, entry-level space sim that is designed for simplicity and accessibility.  It is a lot of fun and very easy to pick up, even for someone unfamiliar with the genre.  It is not designed for seasoned veterans of the space sim genre and does not offer the depth of a game like Elite: Dangerous.  For anyone who wants a good stepping stone to get into the genre, this game is $10 well spent.","December 21, 2015","true","5.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's a good job it does combine the two ideas together. Otherwise this game would not be quite so good.\n\nThe trading part of it is almost a complete rip of the original "X-Tension" - except MUCH lighter - you only have one ship to pilot (though that ship does evolve as the game progresses), there's hardly any weapons / equipment to spend your credits on, very few, and very repetitive, sandbox mode missions. In fact if this was the only aspect to the game, Darkstar One would be one of the most pathetic turkeys in history. Luckily this "X-Tension" part to the game plays only a support role to the main "quest" part of the game, enough to keep your ship equipped up to the challenge of the next sector's worth of quest missions. Which IS worth playing through. Again though, the spectre of "repetition" will haunt you throughout the entire game. Presentation wise the scenery is very nice for the time of it's release - but eye candy alone won't make a game a classic. This is not a classic. It's good, but not THAT good.\n\nYour character Kayron Jarviss may as well be Guybrush Threepwood's wimpier brother. The taunts he uses against enemies are just laughable..... "I'm behind you (duckie)", "Oooh, nearly got you (schnookielumps)" etc..... seriously amusing!\n\nMy copy running under Windows 8.1 constantly crashes randomly. Which brings up a really detailed error reporting system to report the problem to Ascaron. This error reporting system then ALSO CRASHES every time. Jesus. H. Christ!\nStill, thanks to the continuous autosaves done at every available opportunity, you'll never find yourself loosing more than five minutes worth of effort!\n\nIt's 1000% worth the £1.19 that's it's currently on offer for the next few days, along two other titles!

The space combat is exciting, and though there's not much variation from battle to battle, they're generally quick enough to prevent it from being tedious. There's also a bit of an economy you can learn, as well as a sort of reputation/morality web that gives you certain perks based on your playstyle. It'd be nice if the game wasn't so dependent upon its story, but then again, it lets you know up front that its RPG elements are strictly secondary.

Okay.  Let's see what they have...  Hmm, interesting, here's a neat little game.\n\nI won't compare Darkstar One directly to any of the Big Four.  In case you have no idea what I am talking about, then let me give you a hint:  The Big Four games in this genre start with the letters F, P and X.  (Two share the letter 'F' for their name.)  These games are held by many of space sim/combat games to be the pinnacle of the genre.\n\nBut I'm not going to invoke the Big Four in direct comparison to Darkstar One.  Comparing DSO to any of those has been done before in other reviews, and at times, I feel this comparison is unjustified, particularly when people say DSO isn't "as good" as the Big Four.\n\nI suspect the developers of DSO have played the Big Four.  There's lots of elements from those games present in DSO -- And, in fact, I would argue that you couldn't MAKE a space sim/combat game without having those elements, either borrowed intentionally or re-created without realizing it.  It's like hold-left-dragging to select units in an RTS game.  That is an extremely common and intuitive manner to select lots of units.  It's become a common verb in RTS games, and in hind sight seems like a very obvious thing to implement and if you were to create an RTS today, you would implement mass-unit selection in that very manner.  To do otherwise would be unnatural and new players would complain.  Someone else found the most optimal verb for expressing an intent, and it's become a part of the building bible for the RTS genre.\n\nTherefore, DSO uses a lot of the same verbs as the Big Four.  If you've played the Big Four, then practically nothing in DSO will seem out of place.  It's all there, it works like you expect it to, and that is what makes this game a lot of fun, even for someone such as myself.  I've played practically every major and note-worthy space sim/combat game out there, and that's not really much of a boast considering that I can only think of a dozen in my entire lifetime as a gamer.  This isn't a genre that gets a lot of attention.\n\nDSO does it right and does it competently.\n\nIf you are a die-hard Big Four fan, you can't go wrong with DSO.  Just give it a chance.  The graphics are good, the voice-overs are decent, the plot and characters are okay, and the game mechanics are just fine.  There's all the elements you would expect from this genre:  Exploring, trading, bounty-hunting, alliance/allegiance shifting, pirates, Big Scary Aliens Doing Bad Stuff To Everyone, Mysteries to Uncover, etc.  The whole kit and kaboodle.\n\nThe only real issue with DSO is that it doesn't bring much new to the table aside from the single, upgradable ship instead of the more typical ladder-climbing of purchasing better ships.  I also like how they implemented the cargo carrying system, as it allows your super agile combat ship to suddenly take on the characteristics of a slow, vulnerable cargo vessel without forcing you to switch ships or land at a station first.  That was well thought out.\n\nThe game is well made and both looks pretty good and plays well enough for what it is.  And damn, you can't beat the price.  (Under $3 as of this review.  I would have gladly paid far more for this game, if I had known about it before hand.)\n\nIf you aren't a fan of the Big Four, and in fact if you are confused about what I am talking about:  Give DSO a try.  It's a good starting point for someone interested in this genre.  If you want more, then don't worry.  The Big Four are still around and you can pick them up at bargin prices.  (For the uninitiated, most of the Big Four are really old games.  Like, one of them is a DOS game!  See what I mean about this genre not getting much love and attention?)\n\nDSO is worth it, no matter if you are a fanatic of the genre or not.  It's not going to blow you away, but it will provide many hours of solid, fun gaming and that's more than can be said for %90 of what is on Steam. :)\n\nKudos to the developer of DSO for making such an enjoyable game in this genre!","May 18, 2014","true","9.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Trade, smuggle goods, steal cargo, kill pirates, or just go postal and kill anyone you meet.\n\nThe limited side missions get repeatedly boring after a while, especially given the vast number of solar systems, but there are keyboard shortcuts for everything allowing you to skip most mundane tasks. The space combat is really enjoyable and gets progressively more difficult as the story progresses. Add ship upgrades and you ultimately become one bad hombre.\n\nI got roughly 40 hours of enjoyment--your mileage may vary. This is not a space simulation--it is highly action based.

It's not like this is a AAA release and it's going to be dirt cheap, right?\n\nWell, for cheap you'll endure an super annoying and unasked for co-pilot, whom, much like her counterpart in X4: Rebirth, serves no real purpose and we're asked to believe that we would wouldn't just flush her out of the airlock at the earliest opportunity.\n\nYou've got one ship to fly that is upgradeable . . . but only if you can find the ancient artifacts it needs to grow.  Finding these artifacts becomes a central theme as you cannot upgrade to better weapons without first upgrading the Hull, Wings, and Engines.  You're even told at the very beginning that one should concentrate on the wings so that our intrepid pilot has more than one weapon firing forward.  IF one chooses to focus only on the wings, then when it comes to fire the weapons you drain your energy reserves so quickly that one will constantly be unable to fire your weapons at all.  You are, therefore, forced to upgrade each area with each level-up, which renders what should be a non-linear game into a hopelessly tedious affair with some really horrible writing.\n\nIf you must buy a space game, go with X3: Reunion or invest in Star Citizen.","March 31, 2015","false","57.5"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","9","18","2","0"

And that was hilarious for the first try! Years apart, after clashing Galaxy on Fire, I suddenly remembered about that title, and here I conquered it again, now on Steam. Still, the years away the game was released did not hinder my player experience, and this is why:\n\nPros\n- Plot. It's easygoing - you've got a girl, some friends, and some business to do, which eventually brings you to saving the galaxy;\n- Easy UI. Everything you have hidden in the settings layout is present on the main screen and can be accessed via "Space+Mouse", which makes the game as easy as your tablet app. Way to go, X;\n- Good graphics. I am not saying the CG is excellent or anything, but giving that I am running it on a retina screen and the eight years this title is away from released hot, I cannot afford myself speaking something against: this is why it goes for pros;\n- Freespaced. I trust this is not a spoiler, and having accomplished your road-trip to hell and back, you are free to gladly rest at any beloved system and to watch clouds running on some blue planet sphere;\n- Descent difficulty. That's as highlighted, not too easy, not to harsh, except for some AA turret missions, where you have to play a very lucky sitting duck;\n- Funny names of space systems. There is an entire sector devoted to Russian names. No balalaika cruisers though;\n- A cutie! Cubisctic though.\n\nHowever the feedback would not be true if I don't mention what I didn't like:\n\nCons\n- One -your- ship. I know it is the best, but still;\n- Fairly limited assortment of side missions;\n- Unskippable animations. I mean those you meet while striking a mission, teleporting, or simply embarking a station. I do know how they are beautiful, but trust me, once will suffice;\n- No mining fun. As it is said: you need to... fire asteroids to mine them. I wonder if I ever be old enough to be busy with it. And even so, the outcome costs nothing;\n- Limited musicbox. That's a space game, not a CofD!\n- Some achievements and/or cards would be welcome;\n- The cutie left me alone in the end.\n\nAnyway, if you are new to the space flying genre, you are saving the Galaxy on Fire for over-Atlantic flights, and still willing to grow to something much difficult and multisided as X, this is where you have to start from. And don't delay it until MS Spaceflight Simulator!","September 28, 2014","true","26.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The graphis are nice. The music good. Controls are good. I used a mouse and keyboard and didn't miss the joystick for this one. Story is interesting.. or was, what I got up to.  At one point, shortly after I reached Earth, I suffered what I now know as the infamous "White Hyperspace Bug".  It is where your hyperspace load screen goes white and freezes.. Rather, you hear the engine, music.. everything appears to be working.. except it's white and frozen.  After some research in the forums and google, this is due to a corrupt save. Simple fix right? Go back a few save points. *WRONG*. Most people had to reinstall the game and lost their efforts/progress.  This is an issue that the developers never fixed and will never fix from what I'm seeing. I requested a refund to my steam wallet for the $1.99 (a pittance I know, but it's the principle.. a *broken* game should not be sold.), but since I didn't encounter the bug until 7 hours into my gaming, I was denied: Twice. Thank you for nothing, @Steam, ABSOLUTELY *SH!TY* customer service and a rip off. My only solace is that I grabbed this on sale and am only out the $2.  Some people were lucky and never had this problem. If you're feeling lucky, well.. good luck. Save often. Pray.

It has a massive map, you could play for 10 hours and not be halfway through it, you might have to do a slight bit of grinding to upgrade your ship once you're fully into it, but thats ok, because fighting space pirates is always enjoyable. It's CG cutscenes are what really make the game look old, you'll immediately realize this game was from 2006. The voice acting can be awkward and stilted, yet if you give it a chance it's kinda charming for what it is.\nIt's a simple game loop, go into hyperspace, get quest, go into hyperspace, kill pirates, get money, go into trade station and upgrade your ship, and repeat. There's also artifacts, they're used to upgrade your ship and are scattered around the map everywhere, they're tedious to get because they're always 1-2 minutes away from where you entered, and then you have to navigate some dumb asteroid that only has 3 variations to it, and get back out. That's probably the worst about the game. Besides that, if you have a new/powerful computer, you should think about Elite Dangerous instead. If not, well this will run on a potato. Which is convenient for some.","August 21, 2015","true","27.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
