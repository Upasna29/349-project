Repeat until you beat... or in the case of this game, don't bother. Because it's not even worth it. The orbit gimmick is stupid and never should have left the drawing board. Forcing players to memorize sequences and deal with RNG on top of that nonsense (to say nothing of the glitches and gotchas that ruin round after round) is just lazy tower defense design and a luminary like Futuremark should be ashamed of themselves.

Fortunately, I happen to like silly tower defense games.\nIt offers a decent variety of towers and enemies, always a key ingredient.  (Although I found some of the tower types more or less indispensable, and others pretty worthless.)  You get money from killing enemies, but also from building generators, so there is that tension between investing and beefing up your defenses.\n\nLastly, the game brings us something new: orbiting towers.  All your defenses must be placed at preset points in 2-4 rings surrounding your ship/station.  These rings are fixed in distance from the center, and the build points are fixed in distance from each other, but the entire ring can be rotated.  This lets you move your towers into position near the enemy's attack paths (highlighted by glowy dotted lines), or even follow a wave around to keep it in range longer.  Since the levels are in space, with no real 'terrain', this is a good way of doing things.\n\nOne of the game's strongest points is actually not the system itself, but the whole aesthetic.  The entire thing, down to the last detail, is done over to look like a cheesy, low-budget, 40s/50s sci-fi movie/TV show.  The costumes in the live-action cutscenes, the flying saucer enemies, the robots that look like they were patched together from old car parts, the towers that look like they're made of cardboard and tinfoil, and the buttons & iconography on the menus all appear just like you'd expect them to.  I've never played a game that did something similar, and while I wouldn't want it to become a trend, it really works here.","July 7, 2014","true","24.4"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","16","20","0","0"

Not my favourite genre of game, so perhaps you should look elsewhere for a review of gameplay comparisons, but I can say I found them enjoyable. Being able to rotate the orbits of your defence buildings is an interesting mechanic, meaning the placement of your guns takes a little more spacial awareness than it would elsewhere. As far as I played, the maps seems smaller than other games, where you'd place less towers, but as you're expected to move them this is a good thing. Means you have to conisder your placements even more.\n\nWhy I love this game is the style. Playing through the story you get 50's style info clips, with a perfectly done voice over, perfect cheesy style, film of bad alien costumes and spaceships hanging from wires, It's lovely, and fits so well. It even has a couple of easter eggs in the films, which was a nice touch. Anyone who has ever smiled at cheesy 1950s sci-fi stuff will enjoy these scenes. You couple that with a like of tower defence and spacial awareness puzzles and you should maybe buy this.","March 18, 2014","true","1.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

True, I had to repeat some levels several times before I got through them -- but do you really want a game that you can beat in one sitting?  I think of each level as a puzzle that has to be solved rather than a simple anything-goes shoot 'em up.

Instead of towers, you have a wide selection of satellites that you have to carefully place on one of the available orbits of the habitat that you have to defend.\n\nYou have to constantly rotate the orbits to move your satellites towards your enemy's routes, which is also the biggest difference to other TD games where you simply place your towers and wait for the enemy waves to pass by. This is a cool twist as it can cause quite a few hectic moments, but involves the player a lot more into the actual gameplay.\n\nThe story mode features a total of 21 levels and has some really cool cutscenes in between. Additionally there is a Challenge mode where you can replay all 21 levels with additional, pre-defined modifiers.

Recommended if you can get it while it's on sale.\n\nThis one was a pleasant surprise. I think everyone is sick of tower-defense games by now, but this one has a pretty interesting mechanic. You place your defense sattelites on building spots on orbits. Each orbit can be freely rotated, but only the entirety of the orbit can be moved. So you can click and drag your towers to make them follow the critters, but you run the risk of moving other towers on the same ring *away* from enemy paths. Similarly, you might end up moving support towers near enemies where they have no business being. So it's a bit more involved than just placing towers and clicking "go". So that's fun! The difficulty seems alright, too. I can generally make "Moderate" at first try. "Hard" and "Unstoppable", not so much. There are a few nuisances - like having to reassign Research Points at the start of *every* mission - but nothing too grating.\n\nThe writing is pretty nice. Obviously, a game like this isn't going to have astonishing Deus Ex-esque plot - actually, the fact that there's a plot at all surprised me. It's deliberately patterned after horrible old sci-fi movies, which is nice if you like it. (I very much do!) If you don't, well, you can skip the cutscenes and you won't lose anything.\n\nSo on the overall, I'd say this is well worth it, if you can get it for less than 10 dollars. A few things made me roll my eyes - really, you don't need to tell me five times about what enemies are vulnerable to - and obviously it's a bit rough around the edges, but nothing big. I could see this do nicely on mobile devices. How about an Android port?","January 20, 2014","true","3.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"Normal" is way too hard. And I finished many, many games, also tower defence.\n\nIn general: Visulas and this great, super-funny (for me) retro-feeling is OK. But the game becomes way too difficult after a few missions. It's due to the complete lack of decent pause, or active pause. You also cannot look at the paths of your enemies at the begenning of the mission... Thus strategy and planning is quite difficult - when yor're playin on "Normal" difficulty. On "Normal" you have re-play missions for many, many times, losing any fun in it pretty soon.\n\n...But when you change for "Easy" (and it's a must, belive me), game becomes "Normal" ;) It's a great relief, because it's worth it - to own it and to play it!\n\nSo if  it's on sale, and you like tower defence games, just buy it.

Planet Earth is your base, and you can use orbits to place sattelites (which are your towers actually). It's just that it's very limited... since there are predetermined spots where you can place sattelites. When I bought this game I was initially thinking I would be able to place them anywhere on the orbit lines, but that's just not the case.\nBesides that, the game can get frustratingly hard, resulting in an aweful lot of replays.\nNow, the graphics do look good and the sounds get the job done as well. But it's nothing special really. The movies inbetween are kinda cool though, using real actors and stuff.\nBut in the end it's all about the gameplay, and Unstoppable Gorg just isn't the tower defense title I hoped it would be. Still, you really can't go wrong with tower defense games, so if that's your genre I suggest you try it out anyway.\n\n[Rating: 63/100]","February 18, 2012","true","2.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nww02/recommended/18120/","nww02","<Insert Name Here>","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nww02/","400 products in account","Tower Defence games have so far passed me completely by.  They just don't seem all that interesting, an exercise in game over.. again.. game over.. again.. etc.. but not in the fun "Super Hexagon" way.  Setting all those towers, and then failing at the very end, when the very last minion makes it past your last carefully-laid planned route, and deals the death strike that spells a do-over.. Gah.  The worst kind of time sink...\n\nUnstoppable Gorg attempts to shake the tower-defence up a bit.. The levels are short, the number of towers small, and their placement is quite crucial.  It also adds an interesting twist: You can spin the towers around to face enemies coming from a different way.  Like Space Run, Unstoppable Gorg takes the Tower Defence idea and adds in a few little twists.  There's just enough here to make it stand out a little from the crowd.\n\nOk, game mechanics to one side, the rest of the game is pretty good.  It draws heavily from 1950's Sci-Fi imagery and schtick.  It does a phenomenal job of it too.  All the painstaking hours of cutting footage and re-creating that wobbly-saucer-on-a-string feeling really pays off.  The storyline is as cringe-inducingly 50s as it can be.   One thing which made me giggle was the brief appearance of a few 10-Base-T BNC terminators acting as the engine pods on a very dated-looking "War Rocket Ajax".. *cough*.. I mean "Invincible" :) .. about 40 years too early, :)\n\nUnlike some games which seem to peter out in the FMV in later levels, and just give text or voice instructions (low budget maybe?) only to spring back to FMV for the final "death scene", each level begins and ends with a "Galaxy News" transmission.  . Each one is lush, well filmed and voiced.  Right up to the end, the game feels "fleshed out", there are no 'thin' parts, if you see what I mean.\n\nThe game plays very well at lower difficulties: the placement and timing of the 'towers', erm, I mean satellites, doesn't matter too much. You can get away with making mistakes.  As you get to higher difficulties, however, the fun starts to turn to the usual Tower Defence Grind Syndrome: placement and timing are crucial.   The "orbital slots" are very carefully placed by the level designers, and it requires the right satellite, with the right level of upgrade placed in the right order, and the slots have to be spun into the right position at the right time.  Getting a level finished can require playing it repeatedly over and over and over until the placement and spinning becomes muscle-memory.\n\nThere are only 22 "single player" levels, so even grinding won't make the game stretch to the buttock-achingly 400+ hours you get out of Skyrim or something.  The levels come with research and a selection of satellites that you can select a subset of.  Most levels obviate the satellite choice, and some leave it a little open for you.  I never found much use for the "sweeper" or the "webber", they just seemed to take up a slot and not do enough to justify it.  Replacing them with a missile or ray gun would do far far better!  I'd increase their range and effectiveness a tad.\n\nOne strategy which I totally missed through my first playthrough was selling satellites.  Enemies come in waves, and I'd build my satellites to eventually counter all the waves.  Once I realised that selling satelites and reconfiguring for a next (more powerful) wave was an option, a whole new avenue of play opened up.  So, as you can see, there's quite a lot of replay value too.  The game invites you to try to get better, and beat it on harder levels with better strategies.  It's not punitive, and doesn't rub your face in defeat too much.  I quite like it.  It's a friendly-feeling game, which you can pick up, play, and put down.. or stare-at for hours-on-end (as I did).\n\n\nDon't recommend it to anyone who doesn't like a bit of rinse-repeat gameplay that typifies these sorts of games.  It's better than most, though. It can make you scream when, after a long battle, you see you lost two medals because you lost 1% of your ship's complement to a stray asteroid some time while distracted killing the mothership.\n\n\nI do wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone who has a laptop and sometimes just has a spare few hours (on a train, in an airport, or lying in bed waiting for sleep to kick in), and wants to have a bit of retro-movie fun, and doesn't mind a bit of action/puzzle.","October 14, 2014","true","35.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are various challenges to do within the game and there is arcade mode if you want to have a break from the story.\n\nA vintage 50's science fiction theme presents the context of the game well. The story is funny and has very typical 50's movie script. The graphics are sharp and detailed. The dodgy 50's style sound effects work well with the theme of the game. The controls are simple and easy to use. There is a tutorial if you are new to tower defence games.\n\nOverall… yes… ok… this is another tower defence game. But if you really like them or you have never played one before then this is worth adding to you game collection.","December 28, 2013","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It certainly held my interest long enough for me to complete the game.\n\nAlthough it doesn't offer the sort of playtime that Defense Grid does, I found it a nice change to have a game that is a full meal rather than an uneatable feast. I love to have uneatable feasts, but there is something to be said about having a satisfyingly full meal which comes to an end.\n\nGameplayYour standard tower defence concept of waves of enemies which you must stop otherwise you lose the level. Build different towers which have different stats (range, damage, damage type, expense) and upgrade them.\n\nI like it when tower defence games bring in a slightly different twist and then also execute it fairly well. Not some silly bit of fluff that doesn't change the game in any way. Unstoppable Gorg has you place your towers in set locations, however they are generally on moveable rings which allow you to position your towers as needed. You can even click and drag to slowly keep your beefed up tower in range of the enemy for as long as possible.\n\nThis ring mechanic is very interesting, and although some levels take it a little further - by either making a ring spin continuously or locking the ring from being moved - I felt that this concept could have been developed a lot more. If it had been, and to the point that it required you to do some real strategising in order to win the level, then this game would have got four happiness out of me.\n\nSpeaking of strategy, I should talk about the difficulty level of this game. There have been other reviews which say that the difficulty is much too hard. This was actually something which prompted me to purchase the game, but I was disappointed on that score. The four difficulty levels are: easy, moderate, hard, unstoppable. I did not find that there was a very noticeable difference between moderate and unstoppable, which was odd. I'm afraid that as a long-time fangirl of tower defence games I'm probably reasonably good at them, but when the unstoppable difficulty never posed much of a challenge for me (except for just one level out of 21***) I'm really not convinced that this game is very hard.\n\nControlsNice and simple. One can use just the mouse, but the game also has things linked to hotkeys. Each tower type relates the the number keys, and you can toggle the speed of the game between fast and normal with the spacebar with esc essentially being your pause button.\n\nStorylineI find it funny that this game does try to provide a storyline. I know that I don't "get" this sort of humour at all, but I do recognise that they put quite a lot of effort and work into the little movie clips.\n\nBefore and after each level, you get a short B-movie style clip. They make me think of Star Trek Voyager (Captain Proton) and Thunderbirds. It's an extremely basic, banal storyline, but it is entertaining to see all the custom spaceship models they created, the "special effects" and the silly costumes.\n\nOne thing I really wish they'd done was to include some sort of 'click to continue' button for the clips, because some of them were essentially newspaper articles and there was no where near enough time for my dyslexic self to read them. I wasn't desperate enough to read them to go to the lengths of snapping a screenshot.\n\nSoundRather one dimensional I thought. There are pretty much two tunes (maybe three, I wasn't counting) and they get played over and over and over again. Although I didn't find it annoying, I certainly didn't find the music to be very engaging.\n\nThere is one sound effect which is relevant to gameplay - the sound of a tower that's about to explode.\n\nGraphicsEnjoyable enough a look. I can't say that the graphics are ground breaking, or that they particularly help to create an exciting new visual universe to immerse yourself in. The visuals let you know what sort of tower you're looking at, what sort of enemy is coming your way, and the path that the enemies will take.\n\nHowever, I will say that there were a couple of rather enjoyable "bases" to defend, in the form of the moon, and planet earth.\n\nPros+ different "moving ring" mechanic\n+ silly B-movie style clips\n+ fully consumable length of game\nCons- not very challenging\n- silly B-movie style clips\n\nHelp Me Help YouIf you did not find this review helpful, I would really appreciate your constructive criticism - tell me why it wasn’t helpful for you.

Instead of places your towers and not needing to worry about them outside of upgrading or possibly selling them later for one that's more efficient, a lot of times you need to travel along the paths the enemies follow to get more damage done or set up towers in better ways based on how you can move them around in orbit. I powered through on Unstoppable difficulty in about 6 hours (with guides - the game doesn't really allow for experimentation on higher difficulties; it seems as though there's one strategy per level on hard/unstoppable that will work and nothing else).\n\nLong story short, if you like tower defense games but are looking something a little different with some challenging later stages, I'd highly recommend picking it up.","April 24, 2013","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I expected some level of careful planning for both the tower type and placement but the later missions mostly felt like unforgiving. Any wrong choice could sentence the planet you're trying to protect to a general abduction -  even if you can reposition you towers at frantic speed.\n\nEven if I was initially enticed by the idea of orbital towers, the game felt like too hard to beat even in easy mode. Eventually this drained the potential fun out of it so I never finished it. Sadly, I cannot recommend it.","February 7, 2015","false","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
