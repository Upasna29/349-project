The nighttime is pretty dark and you will have to use torches, headlights, flashlights or other sources of lighting to find your way around the landscape.\n\nThis game is in a really good state for an early access game! I would recommend this game to anyone who likes survival, exploration, crafting, and building games.\n\nIf you like survival, exploration, crafting and building this is totally the game for you!\nYou can craft anything from tools to guns, building modules, sentry guns, you name it. There's a lot of different crafting materials you can gather such as wood, stone, iron, copper, tin, different types of plants and more.\n\nThe game plays very well and runs smoothly (> 60 fps) on highest settings on my quad core i7 920 (3.2 Ghz OC) with 6 GB RAM and a GTX 770 GPU.\n\nThe terrain deformation is absolutely the best I've ever seen. You can literally mine out a cave or structure the way you want it.\nIt's a voxel based game which means the terrain deforms a lot more natural than a block game would. I can see why this is one of the strongest selling points for this game. This opencl (cuda?) technique the devs are talking about does really seem to do a lot for this game!\n\nThe textures are not "next-gen" at the moment, but very much acceptable for such a complex game. I guess this could be improved once they near a final release. It's definitely not game breaking though.\n\nThe combat is very acceptable. It's pretty straight forward, click to smash (a la minecraft) but that's totally fine with me to be honest. You are also rooted into place when performing actions which is awesome and makes combat somewhat harder.\n\nNow, this is an early access game, but the only negative things I've been able to find after an hour or so of gameplay is that the world feels a bit empty. It doesn't feel static, since there's a lot to see like different types of animals and foliage/trees/mountains. It could feel a little more vibrant.\n\nThe music is fantastic, although there is only one song which loops. It doesn't get annoying because it's a really calm and smooth composition. It runs for a while too so it doesn't get repetitive at all.\nSometimes the combat music can get a little annoying when you're entering and leaving combat in fast intervals.\n\nThere is voice acting for most if not all conversations so far. Some of the voice acting is great and some not so great, but also by far not the worst I've experienced. Could use a little more work in some areas though.\n\nThere are some basic quests to help you figure out how crafting and gathering works which is great. The game really does a good job of easing you into the game so far. But it doesn't hold your hand too much either, which is a great thing.\n\nI haven't touched the real storyline so far, so I'll have to see how well the story is played out. But I have high hopes!\n\nThis game is definitely worth the money and I would certainly recommend this game in it's current state!","March 11, 2014","true","3.4"," 1,119 of 1,243 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","119","1","0","37"

Quests and item collection work well, although melee combat is wonky (due to lack of damage animation for monsters, you have to watch the health bar). Building and terrain shifting with various tools is surprisingly functional; I didn't focus on building at first, but it's pretty easy to dig yourself a cave to hide out in, or build some platforms to get around plateaus. Vehicles and item building is also easy; the built-in creator is both powerful and simple to learn and use.\n\nDisclaimer: I wanted to play this game mainly as a wilderness survival game at first, but a couple of things I noticed in singleplayer (story mode) made me reconsider. I wouldn't call these problems since they're mainly design choices, but they're worth noting.\n\n1. "Surviving" in the sense of keeping your character fed/healthy is trivial; you can carry something like hundreds of thousands of items on your person (including a couple of vehicles).\n2. The main difficulty in the game comes from combat, which feels frustrating; you can upgrade your armor, but it seems to do little to prevent most large creatures from taking out >1/4 of your health each blow, and there's no simple way to dodge if you're stuck in melee (say, against a flying enemy with an AOE ground attack and who's faster than you).\n3. Due to infinite NPC shop storage and basically-infinite inventory, the story mode game sometimes feels like "kill x monsters for meat (currency)", buy next tier of supplies from vendors, do quests to get to new vendors, repeat". To be fair, it's pretty much the entry point for new players, so the parceling out of goods is understandable; it lacks the urgency a survival-oriented game might have, though.","March 11, 2014","true","20.3"," 473 of 517 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","473","517","0","5"

To all of the ppl that say its a "dead" game that will be in EA forever, I guess they havent seen the recent improvments that just pulled it out of one of the low points i spoke of above.  Ive seen even thru the low points the devs do their best to get patches and content out...the game may not have a large player base ATM, but its far from dead and poised to be great!\n\nOld review that still stands:\nThis is the game I wanted from StarForge.  This review is wrote in haste, i think i have maybe 3 hours into the game, and just in survival mode at that.  Game includes a Story mode and multiplayer.  So as of right now, the game does show a few bugs, most of which i have been able to over look, and one game breaker when trying to load into a saved game, not sure what caused it but i can imagine being 20 hours in and BAM, saved game corruption.  But becuase of the future i can see for this game, every bug can be overlooked ATM IMO.  Still I would call this a early beta if i didnt know better. So the best way i can compare this game to others you might know is a SCI-FI Minecraft with Better Graphics, the ability to create your own Weapons ( completely design swords and sheilds from scratch ), and design your own Helis and Cars, Recruit others to the bases you create.  You can mine for minerals, hunt monsters, but its set up where you could not have to do one or the other.  Meat is used as Currency, so hunting can get you what you need to build anything.  Or mining can get you the "meat" you need buy selling ores.  Needless to say, im fairly impressed with this one.  Playable and fun in Alpha, Thats hard to do....GOOD JOB.","March 11, 2014","true","44.8"," 329 of 380 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","329","380","0","17"

Even though it's in Alpha, it still has a lot of content and things to explore.\n\nThe in-game creation editor allows you to make pretty much whatever your heart desires in terms of weapons, shields, vehicles, and decorations. I was never an artsy kind of guy in terms of drawing or modeling, but it is fairly simple to figure out how to work the controls for the editor. Also, there is a small built-in tutorial along with of a bunch of help amongst the community.\n\nThere is also a build mode that allows you to place blocks and build structures. Unlike many other games of this type, it allows you to build multiple blocks at once through dragging vertically / horizontally, and offers you various shapes such as cubes, spheres, cylinders, cones, and much more. Along with this, you can also enter a free-view mode, which makes building much easier to control and look over.\n\nI haven't played the single-player campaign to its fullest yet, but it has been nice so far. I have primarily been playing on my multiplayer server with a couple of friends, and have been creating and exploring for many hours. Personally, the game is much more fun when you have others to play with, since you can go on adventures or see what others created themselves.\n\nTo server owners: I personally prefer hosting a server from the game itself by going to Multiplayer > Host. I say this because the server controls are a bit iffy right now, and from what I understand, the "correct" way to shut down the server is to find it in the multiplayer list, select it and hit 'Delete'. With this being the case, the admin of the server is whichever character created it, and thus, they are the only ones who can do the process stated above. However, when hosting it from a .BAT file or whatnot, there is no specified character as an owner. As such, the only way I've found to shut it down is to either just exit out of it, or kill the process if using batchmode. Of course, there could be something I'm missing entirely, and I'm sure this will be refined more in the future.\n\nI'm rambling now so I'll just start to rap this up with some of the current, noticeable issues\n\n* Crafting currently seems to be split up between singleplayer / multiplayer, e.g there's some stuff you can apparently craft offline but not online...doesn't really affect gameplay that much though\n\n* The camera can feel kind of unrealistic and annoying to control, but they're supposedly redoing it entirely in the next update, so we'll see\n* First and third person are both options (use scroll-wheel to change between perspectives / zoom in and out)\n\n* Entities (players, vehicles, mobs, etc) can sometimes fall through the world (primarily when in vehicles going at fast speeds for players [~100+ Km/h])\n\n* NPCs appear to multiply in multiplayer each time the server is restarted (e.g. a town will spawn all of it's NPCs...server restarts...those NPCs spawn back, on top of another set of NPCs.)\n* Their town decorations seem to do the same (some houses end up with 5 doors on top of eachother, etc)\n\n* Along with that, objects such as turrets sometimes don't spawn in or fall through the world when spawning in in multiplayer\n\nOver all, as many other reviews have said, this is an Alpha game. If you buy it, expect some bugs and crashes. That's why there is a notification telling you this game is in Alpha. I myself have only encountered a couple bugs in game and maybe one crash or two. However, I don't know how other people's computers will handle it and what their experience may be like. All I can say is that if you don't want to deal with bugs or possible crashes, then I'd suggest waiting a while for it to become a bit more stable and then buy it.\n\nCurrently, I'd rate it a 10/10 for an Alpha build, as it is honestly much more than I would've expected.","June 5, 2014","true","197.6"," 121 of 133 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","121","133","0","6"

Build a base, populate and grow it.  Make weapons, vehicles etc.  Explore the world and search for resources such as ores and plants that are found in certain terrains, then use them to craft everything you need based on schematics you earn or buy from npc's.\n\nWhat it does right, it does very right.  What it does wrong, is horrifically bad.\n\nYou can craft almost anything you can imagine.  Guns, vehicles, buildings, etc.  You make them.  All of them.  There are very few premades available in the game so you must make what you want or find the plans another player made.  If you are creative, you can make almost anything.  If you aren't and don't find other players plans, you shouldn't bother with this game.  A year ago, there were numerous ISO's for everything you could imagine, but now there are very few since updates have broken previous ISO's and creators stopped making and updating them.\n\nVehicles include cars, bikes, planes, helicopters, boats, submarines, etc.  They all share one thing in common.  Movement with them sucks.  Real bad.  Helicopters can't seem to fly above the trees and that would be fine if they didn't get stuck on the trees if you hit one.  The ground is so uneven that any ground transport bounces all over the place and hits everything in sight, or just flat out gets destroyed from bouncing and hitting the ground constantly.  Turning vehicles is not as easy as you would think and often times hitting an object, backing up turning, then turning more going forward still results in you hitting the exact same object.  Vehicles can get stuck on the ground, on the plants, on rocks, etc.  Most areas of the map are actually faster to walk through than attempt to use a vehicle.  Drive into anything and your vehicle gets damaged.  Park near a predator and they will attack your vehicle until it is destroyed or they die.  Fly a helicopter into a flying creature you didn't see because of lag and who knows, maybe it stalls and you drop to the ground and die while your helicopter blows up into pieces and leaves you stranded there.\n\nThe map is a limited use abstract with very little details but does allow fast movement between discovered points.  The scanner map shows you more of the terrain, but is very difficult to decipher if you are looking for ore and quickly becomes useless if you are digging into a ore vein since it clutters up rapidly.\n\nLighting is almost useless since personal lights point directly forward with no means to use them to light up areas above, below or to the side of the character.\n\nNPC ai is getting better but followers still get stuck on terrain sometimes and can easily be lost when you are crossing a long distance.\n\nCombat is very basic with melee attack only or manually shooting a weapon.\n\nMost quests are easily completed but some hunting quests give you only a name of a creature that is useless if you haven't been playing long enough to figure out what the different creatures are.  Some creatures for hunting quests are also difficult to find since they can be very rare creatures or travel around a lot.\n\nUpdates are fairly slow in coming, but progress has been significant in the last year.   Crashes still happen fairly often but autosave keeps you from losing more than a couple minutes of progress so they are a minor problem.\n\nOverall, the potential for this game is great, but it does need more work to be really enjoyable.  Mostly the vehicle controls and ground smoothing hamper the game at this point.  When it takes forever to walk from known areas to new mission areas, it gets tedious fast when you know a vehicle would be faster, but are so not worth the trouble to use.","November 23, 2015","false","53.6"," 149 of 179 people (83%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","83","149","179","9","1"

It's beautiful and fun to play alone or with friends. Just remember it is early acces alpha and give it time for updates. It's already improved leaps and bounds in the past 9 months.\n\nThis is actually the first game I took the "early access" chance on and I don't regret it! It has however, spoiled me with high expectations for other early access titles, lol.\n\nI love building games and for me, this was the first voxel builder that let me work with different shapes. Awesome.\nIt also has furniture and decorations. The creatures in this game have a wonderfully alien feel to them and the mega-huge boss mobs are very impressive and inspires a definite "holy $#!+, we are supposed to kill THAT?" *runs away* feeling. Exploring is great, even early on before you have the materials to craft the ridiculous aircraft and such, you can make jet packs and grapling hooks for some seriously fun travel through the world.\n\nThe feature I'm most looking forward to at the moment  is farming to be fully functional in multiplayer mode since that's where I spend 99% of my time, playing with my friends and family on our lan based servers.\n\nCombat needs to be a little more interesting but they've already stated they're working on that and sooo much more. The devs regularly communicate with their players and are regularly pumping out updates and hotfixes. They're also working on making the single-player story mode into multi-player which was a huge request from the players.\n\nYes, it's alpha, there are still bugs though most of the game-breaking-frustrating bugs seem to have been taken care of since I started last spring. This is without a doubt one of my favorite games I found on Steam. A hidden gem of sorts, and while it isn't finished, the progress it's made already is phenomenal and I always look forward to the next major patch to see what craziness they've managed to pull of next!","January 1, 2015","true","488.0"," 79 of 81 people (98%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","98","79","81","11","0"

That is not to say that time played by default makes my opinions correct, or at all helpful, but I will try.\n\nSo I have been keeping an eye on this game since pretty much the start, maybe 2 years, not sure. But so far I have noted these key points.\n\nThe Developers:\n#The developers seem quite dedicated.\n#They seem ambitious, almost to a fault but not quite.\n#They are a recent announcement to upgrade to unity 5 shows they wish to improve even what seems to be set in stone.\n#They are slow, but they are also detailed, few game crushing bugs have ever popped up.\n#They are a small team, and not as vocal with their community as I would like.\n(keep this last one in mind when I describe the game, as it means alot when it comes to visual assets.)\n\nThe Game:\n#Graphics are pretty good in some ways, but a letdown in other.\n#The art style for humans leaves them feeling a little less real, and can be seen as a little cartoonish\n#Character customization leaves a lot to be desired but has come a long way since earlier versions.\n#Animation leaves a lot to be desired but it has been already announced they are going over the animations from scratch and making very impressive leaps, set to be released in 0.90 along with Unity 5 engine.\n#Combat is currently clunky, ranged weapons are your only real weapon, use a bow at first but aim for a laser weapon ASAP and a large supply of batteries. Combat in melee is not an option at the moment but in a recent video they have shown great progress in the combat system coming in 0.90 Unity 5 update.\n#AI is parted into what seem to be factions, often you will see animals fighting in clear and defined rolls of hunter and prey, truly one of the fantastic parts of this game.\n\nAs for my impression of the game as a whole?\nI like it, I played through all the story that is currently there, and when I hit that first message saying I could not take this mission because it was not currently complete, I was left begging for more.\n\nHowever I do worry the 0.90 update will require a total restart of my play through, but with all I have learned, and baring major changes, I will be able to do everything even better and even faster next time round, I know where you hid my aluminum you sly dogs!\n\nI would buy this game again, but there is one fact I must stress to all consumers. So please read this and take it to heart.\n\nThis is an early access game, you may end up with something you did not expect, it may be bad, it may be good, it may be total trash, but you knew this going in, you paid for an unfinished untested product and it is your risk alone to take!","March 16, 2015","true","95.9"," 87 of 94 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","87","94","0","6"

The game wasn't RPG'ish previously, and to be honest I don't think it should beConclusion\n\nAll this forces me into the conclusion that the developer either lost interest or lost financing.\n\nThe developers will have to take steps toward completing the existing story content, and build a flawless GUI or at least a decent GUI.\n\nAlso they should probably optimze the game code.

Game has some story bugs that can crash or ruin a game save; always save your game in multiple slots and often!!  The interfaces are not scalable; that is being fixed.\n\nMultiplayer:\nYou can create your own server or join others; you will have to open ports on your router and direct that port traffic to your computer; as such, you need to set a static local IP for your server within your router (lock your IP to your mac address), so that if you reboot your computer it will retain the same IP.  Take that IP and now open the ports that the game tells you to in your router, directing that traffic to your server only.   MP servers can be set to allow pvp, or simply cooperative.  The creator of the server can set people to be admins, unable to build, or kick/ban people from the server.  Once you start the server, you do not need to join the game for it to run.  At a certain point your digging will cause some parts of the map to not load (due to the 32-bit veersion and 3.5 gig memory threshold),  when this happens, you cannot log in.  To fix this, stop the server, and delete the files in the voxel folder of your server, located in your steam folder.   Multiplayer is being worked on too, and will hopefully have the ability to capture the flag soon.\n\nThe Workshop:\nThe game workshop only allows you to share your items after you start the game; choose to play multiplayer; select or craft a character; and then open the workshop to upload your item.  Sometimes it is difficult to upload, just keep trying.  The only way to find items however, is to select a category and then page through all the items under that category.  Search by name is ridiculously bad.  Icons of your items are super lo-res and blurry, unless you load a picture of something you made, then people won't know what the item really looks like.  The Workshop on steam makes it so you can easily find stuff, but you cannot download the item when you subscribe.  So the in-game workshop is hard to use and has blurry pics, and the steam version is easy to use but you cannot import from there\n\nThe ISO creator (voxel crafter)\nThis creation system is awesome;  There are pre-crafted parts for:\nsword handles; gun and barrel handles for single shot and multi shot, rifle and barrel handles for single shot and multi shot, laser blaster tubes and handles, vehicle tires (multiple types), vehicle engines(multiple types), vehicle batteries (multiple types), vehicle lights(multiple types), vehicle exhaust, vehicle Cannon, vehicle tank cannon, vehicle machine guns, vehicle gatling guns, vehicle laser guns,  vehicle  missile tubes, motorcycle seats, vehicle cockpit, aircraft cockpit, boat wheel or cockpit, boat scews, boat rudder, VTOL engine, jet thruster, helicopter rotor, and some I probably missed.  These pre-fab items can be scaled in size in any or all of three dimensions (changing size modify's the item ability), made invisible.  The material editor allows you to craft voxel creations, in solid forms, paint by single voxel, extrude from voxel, a single voxel can have its volume changed and that single voxel used to make very thin walled items, swords, etc.\n\nThe creation system currently allows you to make static items from the size of a toothbrush to a one-room schoolhouse, it allows you to make swords, hammers, maces, axes, rapiers, a pistol with up to 4 barrels, which shoots one shot per barrel or multi, a rifle that allows the same, a laser pistol, a 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8 wheeled vehicle such as a motorcycle, car, truck, tank, any of these vehicles can be made small (volkswagon) to super large (stretch hummer), you can make a boat, a raft, a submarine, any large ship from a battleship to an aircraft carrier.  You can make hovercraft, helicopters, jet aircraft, flying platforms such as dirigibles, air carriers, air battleships.\n\nIn game Crafting with BLOCKS:\nLike minecraft, you can take blocks of material which you have mmined or crafted, and build shapes suh as buildings, walls, platforms, houses, castles, forts, and other mega structures out of multiples (10+) material types including diamonds and glass. Once you make the house or building, etc, you then can selct a box around the house and SAVE that structure to memory.  If you ever need that structure built again, you can select that recorded item from your memory and drop down as many copies as you want (so long as you have the proper materials).\n\nThe Storyline:\nIts unfinished and needs some serious polish.  Adventure mode is super boring.  Much of it can hang/crash the game.  Make sure you save often and in different save slots every time you save.  Since the story is so unfinished, I can't fairly critique it.\n\nGame Physics:\nCurrently its Unity four, so physics are standard;  the new version will radically change physics, wheel collision, weather activity, material reflection, water movement and reflection.  The combat engine is weak and is being worked on at this time.\n\nGame UI:\nToo busy, unscalable, and seems like placeholder;  This is true because the UI has been completely overhauled and we will see many complaints about the UI to be resolved in the next update.  UI is standard from inventory sort, split, multiplayer drop, discard, to the standard row of hotkeys, and a minimap.  Once the new version is released all of these UI elements will be changed to be a blue interface which will be scalable.\n\nWorld Editor:\nThis editor works on its own, but will not allow import into the current game build.  There are many more ores which can be mined in the world editor which are not in the current game build.\n\nFuture versions:\nCurrently the game is still Early Access, and the version .90 64-bit version has not yet been released.  It is approx. 1 month late at this time; 5/17/2015 10:00 MST  This is still an alpha build.\nA cool item that will be released before beta:  armor designing in the editor.\n\nI recommend that you buy this game.\n\n-Meatball\n\nBETA .88 & .881 of Alpha .90 review:\n\nThe new beta is much more visually stunning.  The shadows and light attentuate over distance, giving real world lighting.  The character's hari animates when moving, and the body muscle groups shift as the player is animated.  This also occurs on creatures that spawn.\n\nCreature AI is much better than previous versions.  Creatures seem better able to dodge and run if they are in flight.  Be ready to have to run downsome creatures when you are on a quest.\n\nThe rope gun is currently not in the game as it causes major issues that the programmers are unsure they can overcome.\n\nThe game is now GPU intensive and I can hear my video cards rev up when I am in the game, and instantly slow down the moment I go to main menu or alt-tab out of the game.\n\nCreatures actually seem to be walking on the ground, and when on inclines, they match the incline.\n\nWheeled vehicles now shift their tires according to the ground elevation, so a car sitting on a hump near one tire will elevate that tire into the car body to simulate real world suspension.\n\nGuns have been weakened and they only allow one barrel now.  I am unsure if I agree with this as some bosses are overpowered and a supped up gun is almost always your best bet.\n\nThe build system has been modified, and the game makes it much more like the creation system for ISos.  It needs serious tweaking and due to its new interface and clunky way of highlighting the area around the brush, I find it difficult to use, especially when trying to mate a block on an already crafted block.","May 17, 2015","true","090.8"," 88 of 98 people (90%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","90","88","98","6","11"

I used to do almost nothing but\nplay Minecraft. I was running servers and had little free time to do anything else.\nWith that said, ever since then I have had an underlying desire to find a game that\nallowed an in-depth level of creativity while being set in a world that isn't Minecraft.\nI played Starbound for awhile, but I was craving the full 3D world that Minecraft had.\n\nAnyways, enough about Minecraft. My point is, I honestly believe that my search has\ncome to an end.\n\nThis game is amazing. It has the creativity aspect I longed for, it has the construction\nI wanted. It even has a sense of danger while exploring.\n\nFrom what I have played, it sucked me in, and hard. Now, I am not going to say this\ngame is without it's faults. All games have them and this is no exception. It can take\nsome time to figure everything out (I still haven't got it all), but that is part of the fun.\nIt still needs some optimization to fix some minor issues, but it is getting regular TLC\nand updates from the developers.\n\nOn to why this game is awesome:\n\n• You can build to your hearts content\n• Buildings/Houses\n• Vehicles (Cars/Flying)\n• You can mine deep into the planet for resources.\n• You can craft a massive amount of items\n• Armor/Weapons\n• Food\n• Furniture\n• Jetpacks and Gliders!\n• There are HUGE Monsters to fight\n• Multiplayer!\n• The planets are gorgeous\n• There is a solo "Story" mode with missions\n• You can have companions\n• + A lot more!\n\nSeriously, I feel this game has the potential to be the next big game to play with\nyour friends and shape the world to your hearts content.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/amallie/recommended/237870/","amallie","Amallie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/amallie/","39 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI have been looking for a game exactly like Planet Explorers for years now. Essentially, I wanted a game about exploration and building, with an additional leadership/colony establistment dynamic added. I always played minecraft near villages, but the lack of content aimed at interacting with and leading the npcs always left me disappointed, and I wanted something better.\n\nIn Planet Explorers, you crashland on the planet Maria after something happened to the space ship, called the Epiphany, carrying hundreds of colonists. Your early quests involve providing immediate assistance and reconnaissance to the scattered and lost crews, who came down on different "lifeboats," crashing their smaller spaceships all over the main continent.\n\nMaria is a very beautiful, engaging, and dangerous world, and I feel that I have only scratched the surface in the hours I've spent playing this game. There are different regions, called biomes because of their differing ecology, where different herbs and resources can be gathered. I find the game challenging, as early in the game you start of with very little and you can't craft everything all at once (in story mode, there are other gamemodes for just building or adventuring without the story constraints). Mining is more challenging than other similar games, because mining to a specific level isn't the answer. You use a scanning device to find various minerals, and their distribution is fairly unpredictable. Building is well done in this game, because the block is visible before it is placed, so you can get it positioned just right then place it. You can also place partial blocks, which adds detail and customization potential. Removing blocks is as simple as pressing Alt while in buildmode. I haven't built much so I'm not sure how complex what you can make is, but so far I've been pleased with the mechanics of it.\n\nAnother fun thing about this game is the createable content. Swords, guns, vehicles, and even decorative items can be created in a special interface, then once you gather the materials to make the item you can simply export them into your game. So far I only have a vehicle in the car category, but you can make everything from motorcycles to fighter jets.  If you are lazy like I am, you can just go to special websites to download the "iso" files, which can then be plopped directly into the files for the game. So far this has been the route I've taken, because although thorough and very customizable, the creator tool seems tedious to me.\n\nI just reached the point of actually establishing my colony, and I have been pleased with the mechanics and purpose it serves. I won't go into it much for fear of spoilers, but it is very customizable and there is a definate leadership element to managing the colony, it isn't a passive structure but an active community. It is also important to point out that this game is in Alpha presently- yet I am more excited and impressed with this game than I have been with many fully released pc games on stream. I definitely recommend this game to anyone looking for a challenging, creative, beautiful game about space exploration (gone horribly wrong- in a good way!).","December 22, 2014","true","32.0"," 59 of 62 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","59","62","0","0"

I cannot in good conscience recommend this game anymore to anyone.\n\nThis game has (had) huge potential to be a good game.  It's voxel based, doesn't focus on graphics, and would be incredibly easy to add content to (presumably).\n\nThat being said, I've waited 2 years for major changes to the game and they never came.  Workshop content and build sharing is fun, but to be point blank the devs let this game stagnate to the point where it's been outstripped by miles, by too many other survival/builder games.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FuckwitSupreme/recommended/237870/","FuckwitSupreme","Lich","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FuckwitSupreme/","64 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAn excellent addition to the sandbox adventure/miner sub-genre, Planet Explorers is, in a nutshell, what people who fell for the hype over StarForge were and still are looking for.\n\nWhere Starbound is basically Terraria in space, Planet Explorers has that same relationship with Minecraft but manages to be better. While Minecraft uses block-based voxels to construct its landscapes, Planet Explorers uses OpenCL. This enables the terrain to be just as malleable as that of Minecraft, but look a damn sight better. Though admittedly OpenCL, being a prototype, has a few bugs, one of which is that vehicles travelling at high speed over rough ground have a tendency to clip through the terrain as of 0.85. That said, the bugs present in the alpha of Planet Explorers, albeit slightly frustrating at times, are easily more forgivable than those in certain AAA games (*stares viciously at EA and Ubisoft*) and barely put a scratch into the rest of the game.\n\nStory mode is easily the best of the three game modes, the other two being Adventure (basically Minecraft Survival) and Build (creative mode). Beneath the magnificent visuals - not to mention the aliens themselves (which look slightly less silly than those in Starbound) - there is a surprisingly well-crafted storyline with interesting lore and bright characters to explore. Item crafting in Story is tiered depending on how far you are into the story, with simple wooden equipment available for use at the start and more powerful armour and weapons being available for manufacture later on.\n\nSpeaking of crafting, Planet Explorers has what far too few games of this genre have in my honest opinion - a fleshed-out  and incredibly detailed item creation system that is easily mastered to boot. One can create a huge amount of useful, fully personalised items and vehicles - swords, guns, bikes, tanks, helicopters, boats and airborne dreadnoughts, to name but a few. Unfortunately, it is not possible to create custom tools or armour, and firearms are limited to pistols, assault rifles and laser rifles (but this might change soon). Nonetheless, Planet Explorers' powerful item creation system gives it a big leverage over other games of its genre.\n\nTo conclude: do I recommend this game? Of course I do. If you can forgive the glitches and bugs (take into account that this is an alpha, and not a fully released game yet), a wonderful sandbox adventure that has the potential to surpass even Minecraft in its scope awaits the lenient.","December 4, 2014","true","36.1"," 59 of 67 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","59","67","0","2"

You run around killing things and getting better items like in any RPG-FPS thing, only it's a bit rogue-like in that you have no idea (at least at first) whether you've bitten off more thna you can chew.  Combine this with almost god-like powers to build things, both permanent fixtures and crafting useable items ranging from personal weapons to land, water, and air vehicles.  And no real documentation so you have to experiment, experiment, experiment.   Oh, and you can starve to death, too, unless you learn how to get food.

It can easily become a total time sink.","November 21, 2014","true","143.2"," 45 of 50 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","45","50","0","0"

They agreed (almost unanimously) that it looked like something a 12 year old would enjoy. Thats kind of what drew me to the game to begin with, its cutesy sci-fi theming. So they will not pick it up in case a friend of theirs sees it in their library and judges them non adults or some other social convention i dont fully understand.\nIll tell you what keeps me playing though, this game rocks! and dirts! and sands! and you can craft almost anything you can imagine. If the item you want is not something you can get a recipe from an npc for, then you can open the object creator and create it. if you have the materials in your inventory, you just export it to the game and BAM! your imagination, now realised. I mean anything too, need a weapon? no problem. need a car? no problem! need a chopper? no problem! need a town? easy as pie!\nAdmitedly, the object creator portion of this game could use some better tutorial in game... but there are a good number of youtube videos showing exactly how to use it (and some tips to using it more efficiently) so really the community has come together where the developers have delayed their efforts.\nRemembering also that this game is still in alpha (currently at version 0.85a as of this writing), and plans to include items the fans have taken it upon themselves to create and share (tutorials, ISOs, and the like) may be in the works still, this game still plays really well. Ive had to restart the story a few times now, due to saves not being compatible with features added/removed in version patches, but i enjoy it (after the first few missions, anyway) each time since i generally notice something in the story line that i didnt pick up on before.\nAll in all, i would give this game 7/10. The music is ♥♥♥♥♥ (its easy enough to turn off though), and the grass is distracting at best (the blades are too fat, and obscure the terrain too well imho) but again, easy enough to turn off... The game plays well, but without these 2 features enabled looses a lot of its gloss (themed music that isnt annoying as all get out would increase immersion, and better grass would make surface deposits more visible). I would reccomend this game to anyone who likes this builder/survival genre.\n","November 28, 2014","true","126.7"," 50 of 58 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","50","58","0","7"

You can choose between Game Modes "Build" and "Adventure" - giving you different access to ressources (Build - as much as you can carry), recipies, and quests. This is combined with 3 different Game Types "Cooperativ", "VS", and "Survival". The difference between these types are how Teams are created for PVP. While in Cooperative, there is only one team, Survival offers no teams - everybody for themself, VS allows you to choose up to 4 teams.\nThis is combined with two options: infinite ressources and play with/without monsters.\nIn adventure mode - npcs offer random quests but with no story on the bigger scale.\n\nIn multiplayer you are currently limited to 3 character slots.\nThe character customisation is not yet very broad at the moment - but seems to be work in progress.\n\nAnother cool feature are the different monsters - ranging from very little to really huge.\nWith this the game gets a little the feeling of Final Fantasy.","November 1, 2014","true","191.0"," 37 of 39 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","37","39","0","1"

If you play this game now, you'll very likely ruin the experience for yourself later.  It's similar to hearing a spoiler for a good movie or sneaking a peak at your presents before Christmas.\n\nHere's an example.  There are two epic items to craft in this game: the glider and the jetpack.  Most importantly, there's only one  first time  you'll build either of them.  If you really have to struggle and strive for it, then it's an extraordinary reward.  Conversely, as in my experience, if you're able to build both of them in the same session, after less than an hour of mining, then it cheapens the whole experience.\n\nSpeaking in generalities, the game lacks ballance.  Gameplay jumps up sharply and then plateaus for a long time -- jump, plateau, repeat.\n\nFor crafting, the game started well, but soon became boring.  I spent a few days hacking at trees, trading, and crafting simple items.  Much too quickly, though, I gained access to advanced recipes, thereby skipping about 80% of the game's content.\n\nDifficulty is similarly unbalanced, with roughly 3 levels: wild animals, aliens, and giant robots.  Leaning how to kill the aliens was a fun challenge.  The giant robots, however, are perhaps 10-times more difficult to kill, and there are no enemies between these two levels of difficulty.\n\nSurvival is way too easy, and without that pressure, gameplay has no tension or excitement.\n\nA.I. feels very basic.  The wild animals exhibit no complex behaviors; they don't socialize, eat, sleep, or communicate.  They are nothing more than wandering bags of meat.  The aliens, who should be intelligent, are glaringly stupid, and this ruins immersion.\n\nVisually, the game is gorgeous, and I absolutely love exploring the fantasy world.  Just be warned, though, that gameplay is loose and sloppy.  I've stopped playing because I don't want to spoil the game for myself.","July 22, 2014","false","34.7"," 339 of 522 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","339","522","0","19"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thresholdseven/recommended/237870/","thresholdseven","ThresholdSeven","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thresholdseven/","111 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis is one of the best games I have ever played. It is a mix of survival, RPG and voxel crafting/building. The story is very good (although it can be played sandbox mode) and the crafting possibilities are almost endless. You can custom design everything from armour, weapons and vehicles to building panels and decorations, imported textures/skins and all.\n\nEventhough the building/creative aspect is massive, you can download other player's creations if you are not creative yourself.\n\nIt is still in developement so there are things simply unfinished like the story mode and it has some bugs and optimization issues but these get better with every patch and the devs are very active. The game has been around for years, but it is HUGE. Even the current content is more than any other EA I know of and it is getting bigger.\n\nThe gameplay is super fun, unique and rewarding. Where other games hold back, this game goes all out and does it in a balanced way. You start out with nothing but wooden tools, but not far into the game you will have a jet pack, glider, ground vehicle, helicopter, laser rifles, diamond swords, NPC followers, pet drones and more.\n\nAlthough the random gen adventure maps need much improvement (and they are being improved) the handmade story map is beautifully made. The flora and fauna are beautiful. The art style is amazing. The creatures are plentiful, well animated and roam in packs that will make you stand in awe as heards of multiple types of creatures roam on the screen simultaneously.\n\nThe resources are balanced and getting them is not grindy. The ratio of docile to agressive creatures seems right and even after hundreds of hours of play I still see a new creature or new plant that I hadn't seen before almost every time I play. There are dozens of different plants and animals.\n\nThe biomes are beautiful, diverse and will keep you well immersed, from the grasslands to the desert to the jungles with luminescent plants that really make you feel like you are on an alien planet reminescent of Pandora.\n\nThere are so many aspects to this game that I could write a small novel just fleshing out a full review and I still wouldn't hit on every point. BUT the game is streamlined enough, has a tutorial system worked into the story mode and has an intuitive enough interface that it does not seem complicated or hard to learn for beginners.\n\nI can't wait to see this game develop and am glad to get in on the relatively early stages.\n\nI would love to see the flight controls have more freedom. Hopefully strafing with A and D will be added as well as rolling with Q and E and directional rotation with mouse movement (like a standard flight simulator) but the relatively basic flight controls aren't really that big of a deal but they could be a lot better.\n\nI recommend playing the story mode to new players as it has a built in tutorial (the story quests cleverly teach you the controls and mechanics of the game) and the map is much more beautiful and optimised. The random gen sandbox maps are pretty bad in comparison and may leave a less than great first impression, but they are procedurally generated and are being improved.\n\nOne can simply play the story mode map as a sandbox by just doing whatever they want and finding the NPCs manually (instead of following the questline to them) to buy the recipes for advanced crafting.\n\nFirst person mode can be accessed by pressing F5 twice. (hitting it once removes the mouse cursor and allows normal third person movement). Although first person mode works alright, it needs some improvement.\n\nRemember that the game is in developement and the story is not yet finished atm (you will eventually hit a dead end) and some colony management mechanics are not finished either. BUT there are already more mechanics in the game than pretty much every other EA survival/crafting game and many hours of fun can be had with the story mode especially since you can play it as a sandbox.\n\nPE can be played single player OR multiplayer, offline on a public server or private coop with friends. Admittedly, setting up a private VPN server is a little tedious as it is not implemented natively yet, but it can be done and I did it just by wathching a youtube tutorial. Even the story mode can be played multiplayer.\n\nYou will not be disappointed with this game if you like the idea of a mixture of survival/crafting/rpg and understand what an EA is.\n\nEven if PE didn't develop any further than it currently is, I definitely got my money's worth and will continue to play it for hundreds of hours, but the devs are not showing any signs of slowing down. PE is headed towards another major release milestone soon and I can't wait.\n\nCheck out my gameplay of PE on my twitch past broadcasts or watch me play live at www.twitch.tv/thresholdseven","April 11","true","309.7"," 50 of 60 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","50","60","3","0"

The delivery is amazing. The overall quality… Not so much. Not yet anyhow.\n\nGathering resources is frustrating and time consuming. It’s almost impossible to dig a hole without having it be massive because where you aim and where you dig is different every hit. The animations make me angry. From swinging a pick to having to stop and kneel to pick up plants and flowers, most take too long and there’s no weight behind them. This makes playing survival or adventure mode very, very time consuming and almost always frustrating.\n\nThe game lacks any sort of explanation on how things work and you’ll find yourself either giving up in frustration or scouring the wiki and discussions for answers.\n\nBut underneath the very rough exterior is the most amazing and beautiful game I have ever played. The worlds are huge and richly populated with alien animals, monsters, lakes, rivers, oceans, mountains, and caves. Each player in a world gets their own settlement where they spawn, which could be anywhere (even in the middle of the ocean) due to the games randomly generated worlds. You can farm, mine, hunt, build, explore, swim, and battle massive enemies, robots, mutants and monsters. You can build a mansion on a mountain, or a bunker under one. You can fit your base or settlement with turrets and shield generators to help fend off would be attackers.\n\nSeriously, check out some of the all-time popular screenshots in the community hub.\n\nBut none of that is where the game shines the brightest.\n\nEverything from buildings, swords, shields, guns, boats, helicopters, jets, and anything with wheels can be built in a voxel editor. Anything that flies, floats, drives, shoots, blocks or swings. If you can think it, you can build it, and use it in the game. What you can create is almost limitless. This is the ultimate sandbox creative game. It just needs A LOT of polish and some time.\n\nI would recommend this game in a second.\n\nIf anything you just read peaks your interest. If the video on the store page made your eyebrow raise.\n\nBuy it.\n\nBut maybe hold off sinking your teeth in and getting a big bite… Just a little while longer.","December 29, 2015","true","71.2"," 44 of 51 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","44","51","0","7"

At the moment PE is a great construction platform where you can test your creations inside the game environment.\n\nThat said i am missing alot of tools to be able to make better shapes then you can create right now, or only in very difficult and complicated/timeconsuming ways. While i have alot of time and patience myself, i can see why many players don't really try to make nice looking creations, but only stuff 'to get the job done'. Physics are off too in the game, so that makes it even more complicated, for example leveling a ship so it doesn't tilt, or a car getting stuck on every little bump in-world ect. pp.\nI get more to the physics later on.\n\nThe Storymode is fun, because it shows you the mechanics of the game, and introduces you to the basics (and more). At first it can be a little bit confusing when you start in the ship over the planet, but with a little patience you can overcome that.\n\nI didn't play multiplayer very long, because it crashed all the time with memory overflow errors. guess i bought it at a time where they just updated the game from 0.86 to 0.87 and a major bug or bugs kept the game crashing for me. I don't want to get too much into detail what it was, but they fixed that pretty fast in 0.871 so it was playable again. That said, you will run out of memory in adventure mode fast when you travel around alot because the game is still 32-bit, which means that you only have about 3 GB of memory for the game, which is not enough for a long playtime, specially when traveling around alot. (The Textures don't  seem to be updated, they just get added until you crash when you run out of memory space.) I can play story mode in nearly best quality for a long time before things go wrong though.\n\nThe developers are working on a version they call 0.9 which has 64-bit and the new Unity 5 engine, which hopefully solves that memory problem.\n\nGameplay: (i am talking about story mode now, because that is what i usually play:)\n\nAlthough it is alot of fun to play the story, you can see and feel that there is still a lot of work to be done to get the game into more then an alpha stage. i don't really need perfect combat animations, ( they promise to change the combat in 0.9, we'll see), but the world, as pretty as it looks at first glance, becomes pretty uninteresting after a couple hours of gameplay. it just lacks a certain... detail here and there. I think i can explain that to myself reading from others that it's a small team programming the game. How much more detail there will be later on nobody can predict at this point. I also have to put in the fact that the game came out 2 years ago, but they are still working on it, so i see that actually as a positive aspect, keeping a small team in mind.\n\nHowever, there are huge differences in graphics quality that i cannot explain: The animals look GREAT, i mean GREAT GREAT... the area around them for now is more like average compared to them. The animations could be better, but for my taste are more then good enough to make them feel very much alive. The plants, trees and so on on the other hand don't move at all, they are like statues, and if you hit a smaller tree with your ride, it gets damaged and that small tree doesnt move at all getting hit by a 50 t  4x4 tank ;-) .\nPhysics are still lacking here big time, and that is only one example of the physics not really working right atm. I hope they fixe those things later on.\nThe currency in story mode is 'meat', which is... something getting used to. I suggested 'protein' for a supplement, and i got a response they consider it. We'll see :-)  (this is another indicator they take your input seriously)\n\nFrom what i hear they use cash or credit for multiplayer, which is something people just are more accustomed to in games... why just not keep it that way? I never played a game before that uses 2 different currencys in different game modes, and it just complicates things...\nI understand they want to make the story mode more like a survival game mode, but just using a currency that sort of suggests that isn't enough imho. Don't make currency you can eat... no other food at home? just eat some dollar bills! :-)\n\nThat gets me to the fact that i never really feel it being a struggle to survive. At all. You must be pretty dumb or very unlucky to die in story mode. (Running into animals you don't know if they attack or not for example... You can avoid those animals quiet easily.) You cannot starve to death, you just run out of stamina and you get slower. That's it. You cannot dehydrate, you don't need to drink. For me those are basics for a survival game, aren't they?\n\nI don't really see that myself as a big disatvantage, because i like to play in easy mode(s), so it's more of a relaxed gameplay rather then hectic fighting. Getting old.... ;-) But i am sure it will bother other people. Games like "7 days to die" do a better job on that: you take damage if you run out of food and/or water plus you run out of stamina while using tools, even more so when you are out of food.\ntalking about 7 days:\n\nOn the flipside i don't like those zombies in 7 days (again personal preference), i would prefer dangerous animals that prey on you and that you cannot avoid as easily as in Planet Explorers. But that's another game and another story. I just hope that someday they make a game where the good parts of both games will come together the way i like to play a survival game... :-)\n\nback to PE:\n\nSpoiler alert:  The whole mode shows you how to build a colony at some point, and you can build a monorail later on, which keeps you busy for a while. But survival? Not really at this point. The colony system with planing / harvesting food seems unbalanced and not really needed at all atm, because you cannot die of starvation, you just run out of stamina, and you get slower, that's it. I have a pretty fast computer (i7 3.5 ghz with GTX 770 Nvidia), and my colony is down to about 25 - 30 frames now because of the farming simulation, That really shows it needs alot of optimisation.\n\nI would prefer they start optimizing things (balancing, physics better framerates) and make the planet look more alive then filing on combat moves. But that is just a personal preference...\n\nI got this game for 50% only a little while ago for 12,50 dollars. (daily deal), otherwise i would have waited longer to buy it. I am happy i got it, i enjoy it alot, even with the shortcomings it still has right now, and as you could see i use it mostly to create stuff. Love that part to death. For 24.99 dollars it's still a good value if you enjoy the story part, which takes you about 20-25 hours to finish (rough guess, depends on many things how long you need for it), and i played that one 2 times alone, because you have the freedom to do it in many ways. Use your imagination.\n\nOh and one important tip: finish the missions one by one, that keeps you out of trouble with bugs. I don't want to go into detail because of spoiler alert and too long of a story :-)\n\nI hope you find my pov helpful, thx for reading!","April 12, 2015","true","360.1"," 40 of 45 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","40","45","2","0"

The worlds here can be massive, the creation options are only limited by ones imagination, and the potential for further game development is endless.  The devs are active, updates are steady and useful, and there's already a ton of user content available.  The coming addition of the world editor adds further customization options.  It's all pretty exciting... hitching a ride in the development process is groovy.  This game and Prison Architect have generated a ton of goodwill from me directed towards Early Access.\n\nHighlights for me so far include:\n\n- Exploring certain luminous areas at night.  The flora and night sky can be striking.\n- Building a massive base in a cave system\n- Learning to use the jetpack... and sometimes going SPLAT\n- Building some crazy/interesting/useful community ISO items, like a VW bus, great weapons, and the Millennium Falcon\n- Running into the Giant Robot once or twice and getting absolutely (and humorously) destroyed\n\nNow, I would say that this sort of gameplay has to be your thing... not everyone is going to dig it.  Mining and gathering can get a little tedious.  Harvesting plants is sometimes a large pain.  And like any alpha, there are some bugs (though I've not had any real problems), and things are going to need to be fixed as development continues.  But the potential... stacked on to what's already here... is, again, pretty exciting.\n\nIf you like rpgs, sandboxing, exploration, creation and all that jazz, this game could be a great fit.

If you only want to build and build and build you should definitely get this game. But you can't really do much with the stuff you built (in survival/adventure) because of performance issues, so if you only want to play survival you may want to wait until they fix the performance related problems/release a 64bit version. I played my world in adventure mode for over 15 hours before I stopped because it just became unplayable. It happanes after some time, the game will constantly run out of memory and will run at 10-15FPS (it starts at 60 and gets worse and worse as you build, mine and do stuff). I have an i5-760, 12GB of RAM and a GTX 770, for reference.","July 22, 2014","true","39.7"," 38 of 45 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","38","45","0","0"

I've had this game for years now, it was one of the first steam games I've ever owned. This company develops this game slowly. I bought this game RIGHT AFTER RELEASE and its been $24.99 since the start. I bought two copies when I bought the game out the door, and like I said 250k copies sold!\n\n250k x 24.99 = $6,247,500\n\n\nYet they still can't manage to get the game to work on Mac... after years.\n\n\nThis company could bank that money and collect enough interest to carry on as a game development company off of interest on this game alone, but I see such little effort on this game it hurts, (get a new treasurer? Or maybe an actual budget plan for more patches) They have enough money to develop this game more than they have, anyone can see that with the patch notes vs. copies sold and lets face it, they've sold more than enough to carry this game, that's blatantly obvious!\n\n\nHad a great time struggling through constant crashes and corrupt save files only finding myself to start all over again many times. But what left me trying and gave me hope is the original vision for this game, the freedom to design your own stuff from houses to transportation and weapons that would glitch in many different ways. but now two years later and hardly any progress, I'm left upset with my hopes and dreams pumbled into the ground.\n\nPlease guys work on this game more and show us you care about us as well as your own creation and I'll be more than happy to edit/rewrite my review, but right now I'm left sad. Will always review patch notes and maybe one day be left happy enough to suggest this game to people again.\n\n\nI feel they have made enough money to work on this game harder than they have, and what they have done, isn't very much in the ways of getting close to calling this game close to done (but they still make statements like they are going to release it this year...either they think they can get SO MUCH done in this year, or they simply think their pace presented thus far is good enough and say "good enough for release". Either way shows a poor structure. Either they've neglected the game and now will hammer it out, or they simply don't dream like they used to for this game and don't mind it being somewhere around a paper weight... and I mean PAPER WEIGHT, it doesn't work on Mac, its a paper weight still or maybe we can call it a great "launcher crash simulator.").\n\nBut in a certain respect, they haven't officially released a release date yet, but have ball parked saying this year so lets just hope better calls will be made, especially when it comes to the development of this game getting there.\n\n\nSoooooo.... fingers crossed?\n\n\nhttp://steamspy.com/app/237870\n\n\n250k people bought this game and own it so 250k x 24.99\n\n\nStill low patch rate!\n\nYou know what also upsets me, this game community has been excited about this game for years, talking about this games potential and how great it can be...for years, but yet I haven't seen anything really happen in the ways of the games development, truly, it's heartbreaking to everyone who genuinely loved this game, including myself, but several million later and years later...nothings really happened at all.\n\n\n\nI know the developers were working on the game 2 and a half years prior to it being put on steam, now an additional almost 3 years and its practically in the same place it was at when it was first put on here, some would even argue it's gotten worse since it's steam release.\n\n\nIf you go into patch notes and look at the bottom of page 11 and read them announcing finally being on steam after 2 and half years of development that's proof right from the horses mouth. I just don't feel anyone should be sitting around another 3-5 years discussing this games "potential" anymore. it's out the door and the devs shot it in the back ally.\n\n\n\nDon't list comments below unless you have facts on statements being false. Research is made before updating this review as well as being a member of this community for years and reading what developers have said and reviewing patch notes as well as playing and discovering good and bad points of this game. The simple fact is this game, in all the time it's been around now, is letting its community down, if you don't trust my review look around and read what others are saying as well. It's stuck! ME personally was excited about this game, bought it and played it with hopes and excitement, it wasn't just another game for my collection it was THE game I wanted, the game that got me to join steam to try it, now I'm left disappointed, and part of making a review is sharing my feelings and my knowledge about whats going on. If you leave inappropriate comments, bad mouthing or being upset about what I'm saying, I will delete your comments, its called if you don't like it, walk away and look somewhere else for an opinion. If you wish to prove me wrong, please present facts, because this review is also about changing with the game as the game changes. If the developers step up their game, then comments about slow development will be removed, if they fix things about the launcher on Mac, then I'll remove it not working for Mac.

There are many pros to this game in its current state which is Alpha, most games in this state aren't even playable however this truly is.\nThe combat system could use a little work however it still is pretty good, multiplayer could use a little bit of work due to the fact you need to port forward to host.. maybe there will be server hosting in the future for those who can't do it on their own.

And still we dont get a decent successor of minecraft!\n\nPlanet Explorers has the first engine which look decent. Other than other Unity voxel games it goes a new way, away from the block shaped minecraft clone worlds.\n\nWhat is the engine capable of?\n- generating a very nice looking 3D environment, with rivers, lakes, hills, mountains and endless oceans. A whole map can be 40x40km, thats not even close to be as big as a minecraft world, but still big enough to satisfy a great number of players.\n- having a lot of free roaming animals, that even work in groups, defend each other or fight other species.\n- having building sized boss enemis, with a great amount of different attacks (I mean seriously building sized, they are ♥♥♥♥ing huge).\n- complete voxel based 3D mapping. You can dig through every mountain for ressources, still the areas arent made of simple cubes, also you dont have a restriction of placing objects in a square system. And sometimes you can find gigantic caves, that even have lakes and rivers inside of them, big enough to fly through them with helicopters.\n- oh yeah, the game also has vehicles and guns. And the best part is: You can build them all by yourself (this would be maybe the current core element of the game)\n- A colony system with real working NPCs like a Real Time Strategy Game\n\nWhat are the cons?\n- lack of actual exploring stuff\n- lack of balance (if you start on a gold and iron / aluminium spot, you can make your end equip in 30 minutes, or you die over and over again, because there is an enemy alien camp right ahead and constantly raiding you)\n- from patch to patch fluctuating between super stable and crashing every 15 minutes\n- you need a high end PC\n- you need to be very creative in crafting, or you are bound to other players workshop stuff\n- overpowering open world bosses are way to easy\n- sometimes annoying gamebreaking bugs like selfkill with a melee weapon\n- lack of content to do\n\nThe main course:\n\nCrafting:\nThe game comes with a complex editor, that allows the player to design his own guns, swords, shields, vehicles, boats and helicopters. It also allowes to craft free style objects without deeper purpose, that can be used as furniture, from a simple chair to a laptop with detailed screen.\n\nBeing awesome as it is, the editor doesnt glance with user friendlyness. Even making a corner or edge or diagonal structures can be a pain, creating round, sharp, beautiful looking or complex filigrane objects are only possible by...I dont know...havent figured it out jet. And the other players arent really helpful in answering this question.\nAlso using material for your objects changes its abilitys. Every ressource has stability and weight, with aluminium being the most useful ressource, due to its strength and low weight. Creating a good looking weapon and also giving it good stats can be a painful balance act. For example I figured out, that a strong gun should have 40 aluminium as building costs. That way it would have 170 damage and exactly 100% accuracy. Every try of building it bigger would decrease the accuracy under 100% so that the gun wont shoot a straight line anymore.\nSwords are even worse because I still havent figured out, how to craft sharp blade structures with the editor. But the damage of the blade is calculated from the size of the weapon and how sharp the front is. I have found a workaround, but I dont think this is the way the game should be used.\n\nBuilding vehicles is awesome, but currently the game restricts you, wherever it can. You are not allowed to use every vehicle part for every type of vehicle. You have restrictions of maximal parts of one type. I dont know if that is supposed to be some sort of balancing...\nFor example you can use big thrusters instead of rotors for your helicopters, but you cant use those thrusters in other vehicle types. Yeah, maybe it doesnt work this way, but...why do I also cant use the helicopter energy cells on ground vehicles? I can use them on boats, why not in a car? That way, a tank rapitly runs out of fuel and ammo and isnt capable of doing long range scouting + fighting great amounts of enemys.\n\nAll in all you still can do a lot with the editor. More options are already announced (armor crafting).\n\n\nColony:\nWhile in minecraft you only build houses to feel happy (and be save at night), here you can build up a functional colony, with defence systems, factorys and farming. Also you are able to recruit NPCs to work for you. This currently only works in Singleplayer.\n\n\nAll in all Planet Explorers is a decent try of a open world sandbox, where you finally literally can do, what you want. I hope they wont let us down.","March 1, 2015","true","153.3"," 34 of 42 people (81%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","81","34","42","4","4"

For $24.95, even at full price this game is well worth the value. The developers have made good on many of their promises, though they may have set their own bar too high. As it stands, if this game never got another update I feel like a certainly got my moneys worth - much better than many AAA games that costs $49 or $59 on Steam. No Man's Sky will have a lot more stuff to do (a similar game on the horizon), but it will also be a $60 game. ;)\n\nSo a couple points about Planet Explorers:\n\nBuild Tools ROCK! Love how easy it is to just pull and drag out whole walls, columns, floors you name it. What might take a few days in a game like Minecraft to build you can get done in 1 day since the tools make building both faster and more fun. The barrier to entry in regards to building your first castle right from the start is almost none.\n\nExploration is pretty cool. You can walk around for hours discovering new stuff, new mobs, locating hard to find resources. If you like to just explore and see what the world has to offer, this is a good game to do it in.\n\nSmooth Voxel epicness! No more Minecraft cube clone with this game.\n\nCombat is OK. It could use a little more fine tuning obviously, but it is there, it works and plenty of weapons to craft to take down both standard enemies and bosses. Yep, it has bosses and they are HUGE and dangerous. ;)\n\nColonies and multiplayer. Multiplayer just makes it great - team with friends, load up a previously worked on world and work on building your empire together. I currently play this with two other friends and we always have fun.\n\nActive developers. It is a small team so what you can expect for a game of this complexity? As I stated before, in it's current state, $24.95 is a steal for how many features are in this game. If it never got another update I would be fine. That being said, the developers, while sometimes a little slow, stay on top of the project and continue to work on stuff and make it better and bigger.\n\nIn conclusion, with the transition to Unity 5 an already great looking game just got even better looking. Don't expect lightening quick updates and constant patches every couple weeks or month - and honestly, this game doesn't need it. It is stable, it is fun and offers something differnt from all the cube based Minecraft clones out there.","June 17, 2015","true","39.6"," 49 of 68 people (72%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","72","49","68","3","1"

Instead you have to find it in the menu or remember the hot key for it.\nMULTIPLAYER IS DEAD.\n\nHere's my initial play thru:\n\nInstalled game, game crashed, had to kill it in Task manager to completely exit the game (was still ruinning in memory).\n\nTried again, selected multiplayer, created character, instead game takes me into single player mode. Tried to exit out of game, game hung, eventually had to kill it in Task Manager.\n\nWent back into game again, selected multiplayer, it skipped right past character creation and took me straight into single player again, game crashed on exit, once again had to kill it in Task Manager.\n\nFourth try, selected multiplayer, everything almost finally worked, couldn't see any servers or the option to create one, exited game, had to kill in Task Manager again to exit game completely.\n\nFifth try, finally got to multiplayer and was able to create a game. Played with a friend for a bit only to find out there is no save until the game decides to save at a certain point (story mode). Says in game F9 to bring up save menu, nothing happened, lost a few hours of game play. Once again had to kill it in Task Manager to completely exit game.\n\nOther issues I had:\n\nFound a bed, got menu to get into it, then couldn't figure out how to get out of it. Started hitting keys until one of them worked.\n\nWhen buying from a store, no indication or warning that a blueprint is already known. They must want me to memorize it. But if said blueprint is already in my inventory, rather they stating you already have it (you can't have the same blueprint twice in your inventory), it states you're unable to buy the blueprint due to not having enough currency.\n\nWhen you break a tool, you get no message, it just turns red, then your fists are equipped and even it you replaced that tool with a new tool, it won't work until you switch to another tool and back.\n\nThe skill system (if it actually worked) is annoying, instead of earning exps for doing tasks, your exp count is based on how many times you hit a resource (I counted 10). Picking plants will generate no exps as well as crafting. Mine or chop only.\n\nPerhaps by the time your kid's grand kids are ready to retire the game might get finished.","May 10","false","97.7"," 29 of 35 people (83%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","83","29","35","4","3"

Overall I have to say I am enjoying it. There is not much to not like. Sure, there is a slight grind collecting materials (if you've played MMO's like WoW, I don't think it's as painful as their grinds!!). While collecting materials however you're immersed in a vibrant world with creatures fighting between themselves for survival.\n\nThe UI is straight forward but I haven't started base building or item creation yet. The basic replicator usage to create 'recipe' items is very easy, and I like how you can click up and down through the layers of items you need to build up towards a more complex item - for example, you need gunpowder and copper to make bullets. But you have no gundpowder, simply click on the gunpowder Icon and suddenly you're looking at the gunpowder creation screen... how intuitive! There are a few tricks with the UI that had me briefly confused, such as 'do not have the inventory box open while trying to loot animal corpses or interact'.\n\nThe story line is easy enough to follow, and the quests are interesting enough. The side quests are optional but you can get a lot of handy stuff like the recipes you use in the replicator section.

I instantly fell in love with the shear magnitude and pretty much being able to design ... well anything, weapons, vehicles, armor etc etc etc..! Every update seems like alot more content.\n\nSo when I seen this game was on sale.. I had to buy myself a christmas present.  Which I did and I quickly began to work on the story mode for probably the 8th time (always got as far the game would allow me to)\n\nSo when I got up this morning and started the game and realized it wasnt going to let me continue where I left. Let's just say I was a little piturbed (did I spell that right?)  But after I seen that there was an update. And began to play... well just say  5 minutes later here I am writing a review.\n\nThats right, the game is still running in the background because I couldnt hold this in...\n\nBefore this latest update the game was cute, well drawn, and just fun to play.\n\nIf you read the update notes, they state this latest update is pretty much a complete overhaul.\n\nSo after the update? This game is no longer cute, it's F-ing BEAUTIFUL!! The graphics have been completely overhauled, and the GUI made more user friendly, this game is looking more like a different game every second, but they kept the best aspects of it.\n\nI dont normally get too excited about games, but if you dont have this one... you are wrong!! I am going to buy a second copy as a gift for my friend.. I suggest everyone do this before they "final release" this game and start charging what it is actually worth, even in its current state.","December 27, 2015","true","19.3"," 42 of 58 people (72%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","72","42","58","3","7"

The fanbase seems to hate that game, for many, many reasons. I haven't been following it, but I love open world games, and the sheer scale and customization of starforge seemed super promising.\n\nI did not buy it, instead I looked around the latest early access games and saw this. The reviews were very positive and the attitude was upbeat and cheery, and there is a reason for that. This game is awesome.\n\nUnlike Starforge which looks like a mess atm, this game looks like any other, clean simple graphics, that actually kind of look like Spore, strangely enough. You make a character (customization is limited atm) and start a Story, Adventure, or Build game. Adventure is basically survival, Build is free mode, and Story is duh.\n\nFrom here on out, imagine a 3d Terraria. As it plays very similarly. You can mine into the ground and actually deform the terrain, you can craft weapons and armors, and you even have the ability to create custom weapons with a voxel editor. (Someone made a Keyblade that looked spot on, I made a miniature Buster Sword) It's great, and shows tons of promise.\nIt has working multiplayer as well!\n\nIt even has 3d fluid dynamics! If you start digging from a watersource inland, it will create a river behind you. Very awesome.\n\n----\n\nSo I highly recommend this game, but it has a few worrying issues.\n\nCombat is mind numbingly simple, I hope this just isn't a priority yet, and they eventually do an overhaul.\n\nGlitches are common, especially in regards to NPC and NPC behavior.\n\nFinal version will mostly rely on the amount of content avaliable, if they add further modding capabilities, this game will be epic, though atm there isn't much content.\n\n\nId say get it, for 24 dollars, or even wait for a sale price. This is a promising game that could set the benchmark in open world roguelikes.","March 13, 2014","true","93.0"," 28 of 34 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","28","34","0","1"

Wow.\n\nEver play a voxel sandbox game and think, "wow this would be great with vehicles", yet those vehicles never really come?\nWell, dont worry. Here you build it according to YOUR IMAGINATION. Although learning how to build one to function well does take some time, you can literally build any kind of vehicle; aircraft, boat or land vehicle, it's your choice. Not to mention the same can be done with weaponry: guns, swords and shields all able to be built from scratch by YOU. The creatures come right out of Spore, much of the equipment is fairly original (minus the standard pickaxe, shovel and axe that can be made stronger with better materials), and although the combat is slightly clunky, devs are remaking combat animations to be more comfortable as i write this review, and the combat isnt even terrible right now; actually, it's not even bad.

I have put many hours into this game (prior to Steam version) and I'm still loving every minute of it.\n\nSo the good-\n\n*Story-  Yes there is a story!!  This is not just mindless survival there actually is a story that sets the stage for your adventures and definitely adds to the sense of mystery, adventure, and discoveries.  If you like science fiction novels or are looking for a break from zombies/horror then check this out.   I found it a refreshing change from games like DayZ or/and Rust.   If your a parent this is a game your younger kids could play.\n\n*Ambience/Setting-  Although it's on the Unity engine the game looks fantastic (especially if you can max it out) coupled with the most relaxing music (yet not boring) I have experienced in a game.   Normally I turn down or off the in game music but this is the first game I not only leave it on I turn it up!   The map/area to roam is HUGE and definitely has a science fiction feel to it and reminds me a lot of Avatar.   Add in a day/night cycle and random weather patterns and you really feel like your in a strange and new world.\n\n*Game Options-  This game comes with quite the package of options that work quite well for it being in early access phase.   There is a story/campaign mode, build mode (get all resources for building similar to Minecraft), adventure mode, coop, and versus mode.   The building interface of the game works quite well in both "build mode" and "story/campaign" mode.  I actually found myself in story mode taking a break from NPC quests and just building a huge fortress over a mine I dug...was a ton of fun!   There is a creation editor where you can actually build customized items (to include vehicles, weapons, etc.) and then introduce them into your game however there is a bit of learning curve to use this feature (at least for me).   It is a totally open sandbox experience so you can choose your own destiny.\n\nNeeds Work-\n\n*NPC Quests Story Mode-  The NPC quests are still a little glitchy and will need more polish.  They work however you sometimes can get hung up on a quest due to strange behaviors by the NPC's.   For example they may get stuck running into a wall and you may need to get creative to free them up (i.e. dig away the wall).\n\n*Combat-  Combat works okay but definitely could use some polish.   Sometimes when you engage an enemy/creature up close there are clipping/blocking issues and you will end up inside the enemy/creature & hit detection could be improved.   Camera angles also could be improved when in combat especially if you are fighting a creature that is above you & your looking up.\n\n*Sound- While I LOVE the music it does sometimes cut in/out at strange times.  For example when you get into a combat scenario the sound will change to a more suspense theme but in the middle of the combat just turn off or switch to the flute/guitar music.   Also the NPC voices could be louder when interacting with them.   I also think animal sounds could be polished a little more as I think they could even add more to the ambience of this world.\n\nOverall I think this is a fantastic game and will improve over time as they work the bugs out and add new features.  It's a refreshing change from what we have been seeing and all of it comes together quite well.   I am sure we will be seeing some very creative builds coming out of the community (similar to Minecraft) in the very near future.\n\nOkay heading back to my mine....never new digging could be so much fun!!\n\nCheers!\n\nwww.ShakesPub.net\n\n\n","March 12, 2014","true","24.4"," 32 of 41 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","32","41","0","0"

In addition to the creation system there is a "Standard" Selection of items you can make or buy if you have the resources. Unfortunately Vehicles are custom jobs only but you can d/l some from the budding library of multiplayer workshop items.\n\n+ The Game has really great detail of graphics.\n\n+ Those who follow my activity thinking know I concentrate on 2 things when it comes to games, Tools, and Crafting, this game has a stellar crafting system in SP and MP it has that potentional but - more on that in the cons section.\n\n+ The Game has a definite level of challenge that will make it not overly difficult but certainly not too easy to found and run your own colony.\n\n+ 1st and 3rd Person Perspective (Switch with f5)\n\n+ The Technology range is massive - For future explorer's you can make some pretty primitive and very advanced stuff.\n\n+ Multiplayer is working now.\n\n+ Patches are MASSIVE - in terms of additional content per patch.\n\n+ The "Skill Tree" - is completely optional at the maps outset. Don't Like to be limited? Just find/create a map that doesn't have it enabled.\n\nCons:\n\n- Naturally there's bugs, but hey it's still in Alpha Stage so that's pretty normal. I can see strides being made with the previous patches (which I wasn't around for but got the benefit of) and I wonder where it will lead.\n\n- Patches are rather slow, in timing.\n\n- Skill Tree doesn't progress very fast. (Which is OK since it's optional)\n\nFinally I saved the most "neutral" thing and imo the "best" thing about the game for last.\n\n+/- The Game is unfinished, and from all accounts the devs listen to those who are playing the alpha when they speak.  Unfinished doesn't refer to a lack of quality, but the presence of potential. As you all know potential is very hard to find in games that force you to do it "their way", I see at this stage atleast the ability to make a great game, but it's not quite finished yet. I was going to reserve judgement until after it made Beta Stage but I decided to review it anyway to let you know this might be a great investment, and pretty low risk if you like the idea of creating your own objectives/world/objects/stuff.\n\n1/6/2016 - Updated Review to reflect the resolved Multiplayer Issues.","October 8, 2014","true","91.2"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","23","26","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Picklechip/recommended/237870/","Picklechip","Picklechip","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Picklechip/","165 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWAIT TO BUY THIS GAME.\n\nP.E. still needs a lot of polishing, but I think the game is, even for Early Access, at a point that it can be very fun and is playable, which compared to other Early Access games is saying something. The downsides start to pile up when you look at multiplayer, which honestly is pretty damn lackluster, as well as a HORRIBLE mess for server admins, and personally I bought this game to play with friends, not by myself.\n\nThe creation and sharing system is by and far the strongest plus for this game, it's fairly easy to make things that look and perform well, and even better that you can spend more time and effort to make something that mimics something from real-life, another game, book, anything. Single-player and the story-mode are fantastic, and paced well, it allows you to learn the game at a fairly brisk pace without swamping you with all the extras and nuances to the game and others like it. However, multiplayer is a bit of a different beast, and the main reason I can't reccommend the title.\n\nMy first issue with multiplayer is that a large chunk of the game is inaccessable. All the stuff is still THERE, buildable, and the like, but it doesn't actually DO anything, because a few other bits and pieces are not buildable, so essentially you waste a lot of resources getting to what would have normally been considered the mid-game from a single player standpoint, which is establishing a colony. Essentially, multiplayer in its current state is adventuring and roaming around in whatever vehicle you may whip up, fighting the bosses and building houses that house nothing but yourself. Which, if this is your cup-of-tea, you would love multiplayer as it is now.\n\nFrom an admin perspective, you may as well just be another player. Your UI is not changed save the ability to kick and ban players from the server - but only if they are online at the same time as you - there is no server log of players actions, any way to report bad players or similar functions. You need to rely on a 3rd party resource such as a forum to get this across and *hope* an admin is online at the same time as the offender. Not to mention, there is not console for admins. If the server bugs out, as it frequently does due to being Early Access and people lose things, well, tough ♥♥♥♥. The developers at Pathea don't agree that admins should have the power to spawn anything, it exists, just not for anyone who isn't a game dev: http://board.pathea.net/index.php?topic=391.0\n\nIMO: that's the stupidest excuse I've ever seen. as it boils down to something akin to 'We can't trust you with the console' which is silly. If players don't like how an admin operates their server, they'll look for a different one.\n\nAt this stage in the Alpha, I DO enjoy the game as a single player experience, as the game is decently polished in that regard, but if you are looking to buy this more for a multiplayer focus, wait until it is further polished.\n\nEDIT: It is worth noting that the main site, where the developers post updates has been hacked several times in the past month, so the forum link may be inaccessable. Not entirely the developers fault, but a show that Pathea is a bit rough-on-the-rails and slow in development in part due to their attention being elsewhere. Prior to the hacking, development was still pretty slow, but they maintain contact with early-adopters, which I see as a plus.","February 13, 2015","false","24.1"," 46 of 66 people (70%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","70","46","66","5","2"

They all hooked up and had a weird four-parent-baby and named it Planet Explorers.\n\nBut enough about the game, lets talk about me. I have learned SO MUCH from playing Planet Explorers! I thought I needed friends and family and a life and a job and a future, but now I see those are all optional. All I really need is to mine more copper, find all the survivors, investigate the interference, learn more about the natives, help the earthlings and Martians get along peacefully, and always eat before I get a stomach ache because the ingredients for stomach medicine are so rare.\n\nPlanet Explorers gameplay is way too fun. I hate to admit it, but they may have finaly made a game that is better than real life. Some of the controls are quirky, and I'm sure that will bother a few at first. For example, RMB is for both moving the camera and stoweing your weapon/tool. So any time you are using your equipment, it gets put away the next time you move the camera. It is most annoying in combat but once you get used to it, it's fine.\n\nThe graphics in the game are way over-the-top. I have to run it on 'simple' just to get >10fps. I have an old computer though, so I doubt many people will share that experience. But, even on low graphics, the artwork is quite charming. It doesn't look -bad- until you get to the minimum setting.\n\nThe new content creation features are very well thought and add tremendous depth of freedom to the game. You can design almost anything- armors, weapons, tools, vehichles, buildings, etc. Getting your new designs into the game however is another story, as I have not yet been able to figure out how.\n\nProblems- Combat gets interrupted frequently by poorly designed pathfinding and physics interractions. I've watched an animal run circles around a tree trying to get me while I stood still maybe ten paces away. It doesn't happen often, but it is annoying when it does. NPCs will run at trees. They seem to want to get someplace beyond the tree but they can't seem to see it, so they just stick to it and run in place until you chop the tree down. That happens a lot. While fighting, your body will sometimes get tangled up with and enemy's body and you can't do anything until they sepparate. So, you may die a couple times because one monster decided to get freaky with you while the other uses you as a punching bag. That happens way more than it should. In story-mode, you will sometimes encounter invincible enemies. They are invincible because they are part of an event or scene and not supposed to die, but you can't know they are invincible until you try to kill them, at which point they start chasing after you and there is nothing you can do about it, because they are invincible. That is a real pain. The build features (for placing blocks/dirt/etc) has no proper in-game introduction, and unfortunately isn't idiot-proofed. There is a sort of mini-tutorial, but after reviewing it I still had no idea how to use it. I think I am finally figuring most of it out, and now it's fun to use, but it is not intuitively designed. At one point (while trying to build something, though I don't know that is necessarily the cause) the game gave me a 'critical error' and my save-file stopped working, so I had to start the game over.\n\n-YOU MUST SAVE REGULARLY AND USE MULTIPLE SAVE FILES-\n\nBecause you may play for two or three days (seriously, not a game for addicts) and then -CRITICAL ERROR- and all your progres is lost.\n\nIn conclusion, I happily accept the game's few, though dire flaws, and I'm sure you will as well! =D\nAnd I feel bad about it really, because I bought maybe a dozen games in the steam winter sale and now the rest may never get touched.","January 3","true","94.4"," 28 of 35 people (80%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","80","28","35","14","0"

It is the future and you are on a ship heading to a distant planet to colonize it. As you begin landing preperations you hit something in orbit and the ship crashes to the surface.\nYou wake on a grass- grass on this planet anyway- grass covered valley. Your escape craft smashed half burried in the new planet's soil, a crew member is injured sitting nearby and you are her only hope to survive. You must hike over a hill in the distance to bring a doctor to help her. Luck has it, he survived as well.\nYou learn that other escape ships have landed around the planet and you need to find them. To do this you must EXPLORE.\nOkay. That is roughly the first ten minutes of the game.\nThe rest is literally up to you.\nYou must gather resources from the planet to survive. You have a handy replicator in your pocket and as rewards the people you help give you some "scripts" that you add to it, then when you have the needed supplies it can create what you need. It is slightly difficult for example to make a working weapon you may need two or three componants. Raw metal or wood and some maybe refined items. The refined items would have to be made ahead of time from the needed resources they call for. Once you ave all the needed building blocks you choose how many to make and press the button. Easypeasy.\nYou start with wood tools and weapon and as you find other resources you can build better stuff.\nI hate to disapoint but their ar no zombies in this game.\nThe main currency is meat. You get meat from... Thats it boys and girls! Animals. This planet has alot too. The creatures they have made to inhabit the planet are... interesting. The seem to mostly be six limb based and multi-eyed. Very cool all give a feel of alien and I found myself running to the next hill thinking "Wow, what the heck is that?"\nYou interact with left and right clicks after equiping the correct tool. To fight you left click with weapon. To gather you right click. You have a portable scanner you can use to scan the area around you to look for resources so you know where to dig. Probably alot more I didn't try but what I did manage to check out looked good.\nThe planet has a day/night cycle and when it gets dark mean buglike creatures that are very aggressive come out to feed. On you. Thats very bad. They emerge from the vast underground caverns that are everywhere under your feet and if you tunnel a mineshaft into one of these caverns you better have some good weapons. And a light source. Because it is dark and dangerous.\nAll this is played in the single player mode from your computer. An online peer hosted multi-player option is available with play modes of: Adventure, Versus and Build. I tryed Adventure and found them to be alittle buggy and some lagged alot. you have the option to host your own but you must do some port forwarding and I had no luck with that.\nIf the devs of Planet Explorers keep up the pace, this will be a fine addition to your library if you enjoy adventure.\nI believe it is made with the Unity Engine so the games graphics are fair and the models are slightly cartoony, with some animation flaws and simplistic actions. The maps are gianormous!! With many types of biomes.\nI have read some of the ideas they have for the future and am impressed and waiting to see it implemented. Entire player created worlds you can visit. All kinds of ecosystems. Fully player DESIGHNED weapons, armor, vehicles, housing and more. In fact an in game building tool allows you to add texture and colors as well as the look of alot of things already. Not to be confused with the standard building in the game anyway...did I mention it is a voxel based game- You can alter the ground's look and build structures via the "minecraft" like build system.\nThis promises to give adventure, exploreing, building, gathering fun for many, many hours with endless possability for replay.\nDang forgot the natives- big, armored, flame throwing owners of the new planet you dropped onto... And boss fights with giant robots and flying things and....Oh nevermind. You will find them...

The graphics are bright, clean, and attractive, and the gameplay is largely intuitive. I find the vehicle building system to be a bit clunky, but the irritation is minor. I have sunk a fair amount of time into this game and I've enjoyed every minute of it.

This game is simply too complex to describe in just a few words. This review will be a challenge to write, as the game just has so much to offer.\n\nPlanet Explorers is a survival sandbox adventure game developed by Pathea Games.  While the survival sandbox genre might seem oversaturated, Planet Explorers has several features that make it stand apart from similar titles.\n\nFirst, there is the Story Mode – a single player campaign experience, complete with numerous quests that send you out into the awe-inspiring world to create your own adventure. Collect resources, fight fantastic monsters and aliens, battle giant bosses, explore the huge map…This is the game mode I spent the most time on, and during my time in Story Mode, I learned how the game worked via the starter quests. It showed me how to use and equip items, how to use the crafting system via the Replicator and Scripts, and how to use the very powerful Creation System to make and edit weapons, tools, objects, and even vehicles.\n\nThe Replicator is very simple to use. First, you need a “script” for the item or tool you want to create. Think of it as a blueprint, which tells you what resources you need to craft a given item. Scripts can be bought from shops or obtained from quests. Once you have the script for an item, you can use it to learn the recipe for the item indicated on the script. There are Scripts for nearly everything, from weapons and tools, to medicines and clothing.\n\nNext, we have Adventure Mode. In Adventure Mode, you are placed in a randomly generated world with random quests, missions, bosses, landscapes, and enemies. It still has the survival elements of every other mode. What this means is each time you play Adventure Mode it gives you a brand new experience. No two playthroughs will be the same!\n\nFinally, we have Build Mode. This is the mode for the creatively inclined. All the resources you could want, in infinite supply, at your fingertips! There are no monsters or aliens in this mode, and full terrain destruction is allowed. This mode is ideal for trying out new builds, vehicles, and objects with the Creation System.\n\nWow, that’s a lot, isn’t it? But wait! The fun doesn’t stop there!\n\nPlanet Explorers also has Multiplayer! You can host and/or join servers with friends to enjoy the world of Planet Explorers together! Multiplayer has 2 different modes: Co-Op and Versus. In Co-Op mode you join up with friends to explore the world and create fantastic structures and objects together. In Versus Mode, you are put on a team of up to 16 players against another team, each earning points for kills, resourced mined, and objects built.\n\nThe game is currently in Early Access on Steam, and is actually an early alpha build. But it is stuffed full of content for you to enjoy! You’d never guess it was in alpha if it didn’t tell you on the title screen.\n\n\nRecommended!\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","June 12, 2014","true","10.1"," 38 of 54 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","38","54","0","0"

As you get farther into the game, throw in some colony management that reminds me a bit of Kenshi.\n\nAlthough the game has been out for awhile it does still have some serious bugs (semi-frequent game crashes).

I was an early backer of Planet Explorers from back in mid 2013.  I have put much effort into playing extensively, restarting my save every time a major update required it and corresponding with the devs, who were always very nice to work with btw,   Please note, my time in game is next to nothing here in the Steam version because I stuck with the manual install of the game instead from the PE website.\n\nFor a good, solid 2 years I was a HUGE advocate for Planet Explorers and if you ask me today, of course I still love the concept and think the Devs had great vision with this game.  Hell, some of my friends probably thought I was working for Pathea I talked about it and plugged it so damn much.\nAs you may have noticed though, I used the term "had"... yes, past tense was intended, as unfortunate as it seems.  I simply don't have it in me to start yet another save and rebuild for the greater good. I've gone though this "Early Access" process so many stinkin times and been disappointed nearly as often, It seems as though the good folks at Pathea may be getting further from ever reaching the goal of making this a proper release, rather than closer.\nThey are a Dev that I fully expected to have this game proving the Early Access naysayers wrong, much like Kerbal Space Program.  Yes, at one point this game was legitimately up there with KSP in my book as far as development and commitment go.\nHowever, it now seems the light at the end of the tunnel has dimmed to the point where I am forced to thumb down Planet Explorers at this time.\n\nI waited nearly a year to post this review, with the idea in the back of my mind that I may actually have to give PE a thumbs down.  I didn't want this day to come.  I am still hopeful Pathea turns this around and gives me no choice but to change this to a strong recommendation.\n\n/Sad","February 19","false","15.2"," 34 of 52 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","34","52","2","0"

Hopefully. The problem for me is not the game itself, or the direction its going in - its with the current state and the price. This is a HUGE project, and so what do you get for your twenty five bucks, right now? In my opinion, you get an unoptomized sandbox that has a moderate-albeit reasonable for the current developement state-amount of bugs and glitches. I just hope they keep going and get it done in a timely manner.\n\nThis is an open world, do-whatever-you-want crafting and base building game.\n\nPros:\n+Huge potential (but then again, so does nearly every other EA game)\n+Multiplayer could be really really fun in the future, and is even fun now, to a certain extent\n+The idea of vehicle crafting is awesome\n+The world is beautiful\n\nCons:\n-Personally, I think this should be first-person\n-Its glitchy, and in this case, is fairly bothersome (glitching through the world/builds quite frequently)\n-It is unoptimized. I can run it at full graphics on my gaming rig, but it sweats.\n-I would bet money that developement will cease before the original vision is completely met (not a bad thing, but this is ambitious)\n\nGet it on a sale, and make sure to play the demo first (I think its on their website).

My experience so far has been of sticky controls, tentative sound effects, and pretty much no combat system to speak of.\n\nIn the game you can design your own weapons and vehicles (the vehicle creation is reminescent of Spore's, or any number of similar games). The system for building weapons is great, it allows for incredible aesthetic maneuverability; it falls a little bit flat when you import your gun/sword into the game and try it out. The ways the game determines what makes a sword have high damage are difficult to determine. The highest damage I've ever managed to reach came from a sword that was a literal block of metal, as big as the game would let me make it. Personally, I prefer SHARP swords, though this may be a stylistic disagreement.\n\nLikewise, my long-barrelled rifle seemed awesome and had great damage, but its accuracy was somewhere between "none" and "none at all". This would contradict the little bit I know about real-life guns, which tells me that a longer barrel = greater accuracy.\n\nI have about 19 hours of playtime in the game, and about 12 of those hours I have estimated to be travel time. It's amazing how long it takes you to get from one place to another, then back again when the quests tell you to go back. There are enough monsters on the way to keep a player docile during this transit, and the crafting can eat up a lot of time, too, since it's so detailed.\n\nWhat SHOULD be taking up some time is the scanning for (and mining of) resources, but I've found that to be a very arduous process. The map is huge, so when the main quest demands you make something with, say, petroleum in its schematic, you're pretty much screwed when the NPCs tell you to head west to look for oil (and the oil is southwest). I guess that's what forums are for.\n\nThen your scanner tells you the targetted resource is deep underground, and it's a pretty peaceful, Zen-like experience to use the game's terrain shaping to tunnel down into the earth. You get a palpable sense of accomplishment when you look at the big cave that used to not exist before you needed something from under it. Getting back out again is a Stygian nightmare. You will hop, you will slide, you will accidentally click and swing your pickaxe and be unable to make actions until your character is done with his animation. Eventually you will use the game's building mechanics to try to pillar-hop, like in Minecraft, except you will clip into your pillar and slide all the way down it.\n\nThen you will write an angry review for a not-nearly-finished game.","March 22, 2014","false","25.0"," 81 of 139 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","81","139","0","4"

The ability to create your own vehicles (ground, sea, and air), and weapons is extremely fun. You can also download ones others have created to use in your game if your design abilities are lacking. You can also save buildings you create, to easily share with others, or if you have the materials, easily replicate again in your game, or even a new game.\n\nYes, there are bugs. Some of them nasty and will crash you, or stop story progression in single player, or other crazy things. For an early access game, I think they are acceptable at this point as the developer tends to keep us up to date on the known ones. Multiplayer has some... issues. I don't play it often to really know them too much, but lag at times was one of them.\n\nOverall for an early access game, I think they are doing a great job.","August 28, 2015","true","94.0"," 19 of 26 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","19","26","0","0"

Not only does it have most of the stuff I look for in a game, but it also allows multiplayer co-op so I can enjoy it with friends!\n\nGot this game recently and am rather enjoying it.  It is presently in alpha version a0.8 at the time or writing this, so some of its bugs are bound to work themselves out.\n\nIt's part RPG, part voxel builder, part engineering CAD developer, part 4X, part tower defense, all exploration and adventure.  I have been utterly absorbed in playing it for the last few days.  I have one beef with it, though.  Companions.\n\nThroughout normal gameplay, you get tag-alongs, whether you want them or not.  You cannot control them, and they are basically along for the ride.  They are mostly benign, and will even SOMETIMES help with combat (which is nice because they cannot die like the 'hired' companions can).  There are some issues, though.\n\nThe first is the pathfinding A.I.  If you are not EXTREMELY careful with where you are going, any following monster bait will get stuck... in a hole, on a tree, in the water, on a herd of turtles.  You can either clear their obstructions so they can get unstuck, or you can build an advanced piece of machinery like a car with spare seats, and HOPE they teleport to the seat.\n\nThe next issue with these hoodlums is the fast travel system.  Let's say you have a waypoint that happens to be in the direction of your next quest spot(which itself is a 35 minutes walk), or just somewhere else you want to go for supplies.  If you are babysitting, you are not allowed to use this mechanism in the game without automatically aborting the quest which demands their presence.  Often, they don't go back to where you got the quest, either.  Nope.  They park themselves right there and wait.  And then you have to go find them again if you manage to get the quest once more.\n\nI'm not saying this makes the game bad or unplayable.  But, if a game developer insists on an underwater escort quest, they had better take some special measure to ensure that you don't have to spend an hour fighting water mechanics to dig out a quest giver stuck in a wall.\n\nThat's it.  Just the NPCs.  Everything else about the game has drool running out of the corner of my mouth.","June 18, 2014","true","61.0"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

But after the long awaited 0.9 update I can't help but write this review, so that maybe I can save others from the useless expense that this game is.\nIt's new year's day and I'm still on a little hangover so i'll just list what i hate as things come to my mind. Forgive possible mistakes :)\n- This game is overpriced. Highly overpriced.\n- Optimization: this game will fry your GPU even at lowest settings. I don't have a monster GPU (Radeon Dual-x R9 380) but I can run almost every game at high settings without problems. Here, at fastest settings my gpu still works 100% at 78° with fan speed over 50%.\n- Fastest settings will make game unplayable since fonts will become unreadable (really?!?)\n- Even at fastest settings I'm having random fps drops and stutters.\n- Character creator is always the same obvious placeholder, which was there 1 year ago or so.\n- Controls are clunky, would best fit for an mmo in my opinion. By the way combat and object interaction are so bad... to gather materials from plants you have to target the ground under the plant, not the plant itself... really?!?\n- Bindings are the most unintuitive I've ever seen. Alt+Y to open replicator menu? Really?!? Yes, you can rebind, but seriously?!?\n- Updates come at a slow pace and seem to just introduce more bugs. They've changed the UI several times, onlyu to deliver another clunky and unintuitive UI.\n- Music. It's nice for the first 5 minutes, After that you'll want to turn it off, since it's the same super-short song playing over and over again.\n- A LOT of backtracking, in story mode. At the beginning you won't have a vehicle to ride, but still the first quests need you to go back and forth between points that are miles away from each other. That's boring as hell.\n- The game, at least in story mode, never seems to demand that you build anything. What's the point of giving us the possibility of creatingour own guns and armor etc. pixel by pixel if I can just use the blueprints I find? Plus, creating object, as fun as it may seem at the beginning, it's super time coinsuming and I really cannot see myself craft more than a couple objects in an entire playthrough.\n- About creating weapons and such: why should dps of a weapon be based on how much material you use to create it? I mean, why should a gun that uses the same barrel (and so the same bullets, I guess) as another one do more damage just because you've put a lot more wood or anything around the barrel?!?\n- Monsters: You'll encounter thousands of identical monsters in each area, which makes the world boring and exploration super repetitive. Now I read they've randomized monster size, so you should have a little more diversity but it's just not enough.\n\nIs it enough?\nI really can't see this game getting any better, even in a year or so, plus there are a lot of better exploration and survival games that play, look and feel better than this that I really can't see the point of buying it, so beware...\noh and Happy new year to everyone! =) cheers\n\n","January 1","false","24.1"," 38 of 62 people (61%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","61","38","62","4","12"

The building system is very functional and easy to use far better than even Landmark's. The creation system allows for even greater ability and customization.  Reminds me very much of Kerbal Space Program's ship creator, and even has a high level of customization options then that.

You can be a tall oompa-loompa if you want! (that's a pro I guess)\n-There are some glitches and graphical errors, but this game is still in early beta I think, you should be expecting that, nothing game breaking though\n-Very few things your character can do, for example you can''t run (may be an upgrade, but that wouldn't make sense)\n\nOverall:\nThis game genre is something I enjoy and it is in alpha/beta stage, if you enjoy minecraft, 7 days to die, or any survival game like that, you will enjoy this, and keep in mind many things will be updated. Of course there will be issues of some nature, but if you're expecting otherwise, don't buy it because you will be dissapointed because you didn't know better.","March 12, 2014","true","2.8"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"

The story mode feels like an MMORPG without the MMO part. Because it's a voxel sanbox game at heart, you can tear the land up basically everywhere from the start of the game. And the ability to port forward to set up a private server for friends is also pretty good, due to the creative aspect of the game. It's PvE or PvP if you so desire. There's things like turrets, jetpacks, and vehicles. As well as a way to create the look of your own swords and stuff. Definitely has potential. The price is a little steep, sure. But you can get your moneys woirth if you allow yourself to.\n\nOnly downside I've found so far, is a LOT of things larger than you want to kill you, and early on you can't kill them. And the game is kinda slow paced as you bbuild up. But since you're building up from nothing, I feel thats understandable.\n\nIt''s definitely worth a go if you have the money! I have to recommend this one from the bottom of my heart! It has a bit of charm to it. I hope they go heavy on the character customization later in development. The ability to create your own backstory and lore with a unique character each time would help the creative aspect of game I feel, once you're done with story mode.","March 13, 2014","true","56.6"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","14","20","0","0"

This game is basically Minecraft plus with better graphics (compared to other Minecraft-ish games), better mobs (from the cute little woodland critter to giant dinosaur roaming the plain), somewhat better crafting (you can craft modern tools and equipment) and a better story (does Minecraft even have a story except killing the dragon?) Of course there are many aspects that are not on par with Minecraft such as water/lava physics, processing items on other items (putting meat on fire to cook) etc. but we shall see how the final edition will be.\n\n\nPros:\n1. Best graphics among Minecraft-ish games so far (DON'T YOU EVER COMPARE THIS TO CALL OF DUTY. I AM SICK OF STUPID COMPARISON. CAN YOU DIG YOURSELF A KHAZAD DUM IN CALL OF DUTY?)\n\n2. Somewhat cool story (as a Black Isle worshiper, I can't say I am impressed but the story is at least solid)\n\n3. The world and the atmosphere are awesome. It does give you a feeling of adventuring in an unknown planet with cool (sometimes crazy looking) creatures and weird plants and landscape and ancient ruins.\n\n4. The ability to drive land vehicles and fly helicopters and construct missile launcher/laser cannon etc.\n\n5. The ISO system is fascinating. You can literally create anything you can ever imagine.\n\n6. JET PACK AND GLIDER! seriously, try it out. get to the top of a mountain, run, fire your jet pack, switch to glider at max height and enjoy ;)\n\n7. other minor pros listed by other reviewers\n\n\nCons:\nsome technical issues\n1. memory leak crash. It seems quite some people have this problem and I encountered it a few times in the game as well. luckily it does not seem to happen too frequently (for me) and the game autosave every 10 minutes so you won't lose much.\n\n2. lag? not really a con but the game somehow confuses people by including an option in the launcher where you can choose video card. THIS IS NOT WHERE YOU CHOOSE GPU FOR THE GAME. if you are using Nvidia card you have to manually set the game (PE_client) to use your gaming GPU in Nvidia control panel or I guarantee you that your game will lag as cr*p.\n\n3. possible problem with fast travel and sleeping and saving at meteor crate. Some players report bugs that delete all your autosave files when they fast travel from meteor crate and sometimes it involves them sleeping or saving at that location. Personally I didn't encounter any problem but just to put it out here.\n\n4. if you delete your steam and then reinstall steam and play the game using your old save (the same version)... you may see some empty texture in places where you dug. when you jump through the empty texture you will somehow reappear in the sky...\n\n5. I somehow encounter a bug where if you put a roof closely on top of your defense cannons. they will magically appear on top of the roof...\n\n6. multiplayer is still quite buggy so don't expect too much fun from there\n\ngameplay issues:\n0. NEED CHANGE ASAP - monster corpses disappear too fast. when you are fighting a pack of monsters, before you can finish the last one, the other corpses may start dissolving already. it is like you have less than 1 min to pick up the loot and it is not cool.\n\n1. NPC SELLS TOO MANY STUFF. you can literally buy everything from NPC with meat. In multiplayer you can even access this one global shop where everything is on sale. I think it is better that only the uncraftable/uncollectible items and some basic starting tools are purchasable.\n\n2. combat still needs a bit of work.\n\n3. can't dig and move at the same time. when you start digging you are rooted.\n\n4. monsters are not very threatening, except that black crab thing. don't know why but black crab can sometimes one hit kill you.\n\n5. can't use weapon while flying with glider (imagine how cool it can be when you rain death from above :D)\n\n6. the bottom of the lake/ocean is always flicking... also the color of your vehicle will be changing randomly if you alt+tab out and get back in the game\n\n7. many objects are not solid, for example, trees. only a small part of a huge tree is solid so you can walk through a tree and fly through a tree but sometimes you can't because that part of the tree decides it wants to be solid and you hit the tree and crash :(\n\n8. the mineral scanner does not seem to work properly when you are moving so you are forced to stand still in order to scan.\n\n9. unlike in MC where you craft items by placing materials in specific ways, this game uses crafting scripts and the crafting script list can be a bit overwhelming later when you collect a lot of them or when you play multiplayer where you are given all scripts at the beginning. although you can search them by types it is still not very convenient.\n\nIn summary, a cool game that is still at alpha with alpha problems but definitely playable and just look at the cool features the devs are planning so if you like Minecraft-ish games then try this out. You can't be disappointed, unless you are that kind of player who likes hand holding all the time then why are you playing a Minecraft-ish game in the first place?","March 17, 2014","true","58.8"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

As others have said, this game is exactly what I've sought for a long time.  In a nutshell, they managed to take the positive aspects of various sandbox crafting games and made it fun and removed the tendency to become boring.\n\nI love this game and can't stop playing it.  I can't say the concept of the game is simple because there are so many directions it can go.  There isn't a clear direction on the devs' part, and I mean that in a good way.  They've built a really solid foundation and I'm hanging on the edge of my seat waiting for the next update.\n\nI came across this game looking for something that gives me open-world exploration and crafting.  This game delivers that and then some.  Easily one of the best games I have in my library.\n\nIt is tempting to try to compare this to games like Minecraft, Starbound, Terraria, etc., and it wouldn't be wrong to do so: there are a lot of similarities, and feels like some of the devs either worked on one of those or took a lot of inspiration from them, but then again many of these aren't really new concepts.  And in my opinion there's nothing wrong with borrowing ideas that work.\n\nWhere this game really delivers is\ngraphics -- the lack of good graphics made the aforementioned games quickly boring for me;\nthe Creation Editor, where you can build fairly detailed models from base materials and attach crafted assets to make fairly complicated structures such as custom weapons, vehicles (land, air, AND sea), etc. -- the CE really is a game within a game and I've spent a good chunk of time just creating things there;\nand the beginnings of a pretty nice "town management" system; you craft the various components of your village, invite npcs to live with you, and assign various tasks. not a lot to it right now but it has the makings of a really fun mini-game\n... and that's all above and beyond (what i find to be the very zen-like process of) mining and scavenging raw materials to build with, and doing actual exploration.  The time in-game shown as of right now (just over 38 hours) is how long it took me to get through the "story" part of the game, and several quests are incomplete, so it just goes to show that they intend to do more with that part of it.  As expected, there are plenty of bugs to work out, but the game is so engaging I barely notice them, except for the ones that break quests at which point i have to reload from a last save or something, but overall the game is amazingly well done given it's still in alpha.\n\nThis game easily gets a 10/10.","January 18, 2015","true","46.2"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","10","13","2","0"

The number of hours of playtime I have enjoyed is staggering when compared to most AAA titles, so I consider it money well spent.\n\nThat said, the game is very rough around the edges, so if you are the type to get frustrated easily by bugs, glitches, and terrible ally pathfinding, you might want to give the game some time to mature.  I lost count of how many times I arrived at a quest destination after a long journey, only to realize that the quest NPC(s) was nowhere to be found.  Most of the time, retracing my steps would lead me to said NPC(s) running mindlessly into a tree or rock, which I would have to destroy to snap them out of their strange trance.  Occasionally, they would get stuck on nothing.  Occasionally, I would get stuck on nothing, too.  This is just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nBut if you can tolerate typical early access issues during early access, I think you will find the story is quite atypical--in a good way--for this sort of game, and the city building is shaping up to be something special.  It isn't quite there yet, but Planet Explorers has tons of quests, tons of dialog, and tons of ways to utilize and/or manage your colony.  The voxel system itself is pretty flexible, and once you get used to it (which does take some time) the in-game editor is surprisingly easy to use.  You can make decorations, equipments, and even vehicles.\n\n\nUPDATE 4/29/2016\nQuite some time has passed, and that time has not been kind to this title.  It is nearly as clumsy as it ever was, and other Early Access games have since been released in a worse state only to progress leaps and bounds beyond Planet Explorers.  I am not yet ready to change my recommendation to a "No", but I am close.  I suspect I will have to, at some point.  For now, if this is your niche, I still cautiously recommend it.","February 8, 2015","true","48.8"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

Also, saves can be incompatible between updates - if you don't like "wipes", you should probably wait!\n\nA beautiful, fun and full of potential game that features a very interesting Story Mode, great weapon/item/vehicle editor and easy-to-use build mode with free camera.\nThere's also an Adventure mode (think Minecraft's Survival Mode - infinite randomly generated map), Build mode (Creative Mode) and also Multiplayer.\n\nSince the game is in early alpha, the storyline isn't complete yet, nor the editor or many other features, but you can already see the game shaping up very nicely and there's a decent amount of stuff to do already.\nFun items like jetpacks, gliders and hooks are already in the game and only need a bit more polishing.\nThe player-made vehicles (cars and helicopters, currently) and items (swords and guns) add a lot of nice content to play with.\nYou'll also be able to make objects like tables and paintings, and put decals and effects on your creations.\n\nThe (current) cons of the game comes from the fact that it's an early alpha.\nThe movement/camera scheme can be a bit annoying at times, the optimization must be worked on, and a few other bugs regarding monster movement and AI, terrain loading and collision detection.\nBut the developers are aware of all those issues, and are working on them (things that slightly annoyed me on 0.72 seem to have been fixed/improved on recent versions).\n\nThe plotline is very interesting and engaging - I can't wait until they write more and put more quests & story in the game!\n\nThe remaining features you can easily read & watch videos on, or discover for yourself on the demo.\n\nThe game is worth it and I hope it succeeds and the development goes on smoothly.\nAlong with Starbound, it's one of the most worthy sandbox games to watch currently.\nHave fun! :D","April 22, 2014","true","51.8"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

I think that whilst the principle is nice, it's far too tempting for devs to take the money and not deliver on their promises. But this game has interested me from the time I first saw it. I've been looking for a good survival and crafting experience that doesn't rely on multiplayer and all the griefers that come with it. This game offers that in what is already an impressive array of single player and co-op experiences.\nYes it is still noticeably alpha in some areas but the important things all work well and the graphics are good for a game of this type. I'm still discovering new creatures and elements and it sounds like there will be more added by the time it's finished. Building and crafting is very simple and intuitive. I was impressed that the story mode had at least some voice acting, hopefully they finish it off for all the quests and maybe add more than just the 2 or 3 soundtracks they've got.\nBut yes looking at the other games offering similar experiences I am satisfied that at the moment this one offers the best experience for those who want an exploration game without forced multiplayer. The direction it's heading at the moment it seems it will end up as a combination of Elder Scrolls, DayZ and Minecraft, blending them all together for something unique.\nObligatory throw away line: "It's like skyrim with aliens - 10/10"","November 17, 2014","true","28.3"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/elitistcuisine/recommended/237870/","elitistcuisine","(OWL) Elitist Cuisine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/elitistcuisine/","268 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nPlanet Explorers is the makings of a great game.\n\nIn its current state, it is clear that it is an alpha. This isn't to say it is intolerable. As a matter of fact, it is remarkbly put together for an alpha. As advertised, there is a campaign mode. It is a surprisingly interesting story about tensions between Martians and Earthlings (both human), as well as a believeable "first contact" scenario. The writing isn't ground-breaking, but it is definitely better than many cookie-cutter stories released nowadays. Regretably with much of the important dialog missing voice overs, it can be difficult to follow. Granted, some people adore Morrowind style dialog, but much of the important voice overs are missing throughout the game. For example, it is very common to be ambushed in the story and forced to run. The problem is that there is no audio that plays signifying a retreat. This can be mildly frustrating, especially when you are killed thinking your teammates are backing you up.\n\nMany of the games descriptions can leave you lost or downright confused. Two examples: when you are picking something up, the button you click is "Get". Not "Take" or "Pickup", but the awkward verb "Get". In addition, quest descriptions can confuse you. Such as receiving a quest with in the first hour to start a colony, only to find out that you need to complete a quest 5 hours in to fulfil that quest. But I digress...\n\nThe art direction is rather impressive. Jungles feel thick and plains are reminiscent of rolling wheat farms while still having still having an alient quality to them. It is clear that some of the creatures that inhabit Maria are inspired by apes, cats, and dogs, but the artists did a wonderful job distancing from many obvious qualities. Be it multiple armed, hairless, ape-like creatures, or pseudo-tiki faced giraffe creatures, the game will always take what you expect and tweak it so that only base features are recongizable. It is a shame that the game doesn't have a strong backing, because it is clear that the artists are talented in making the familiar seem alien.\n\nGraphically, it is passable. It has its moments of beauty, such as watching the sunrise shine through a mass of tree branches.\n\nThe biggest gripe I have is the combat in the game. Melee is a wonderful way to ensure you die repeatedly, which is fair when you're fighting creatures that are usually 2x larger than you. The main problem is the lack of a basic notification for when you deal/take damage to/from a creature. It leaves most of the combat to be spamming attack, holding shield, then spamming, all while staring at your health bar. With the vehicles, I can see damage notifiers in the form of numbers, which almost feels taunting.\n\nAnother problem with the combat is the random difficulty spikes. For instance, while in the mountain/desert regions, I moved from quest point to quest point willy-nilly, but once I reached a random point, I got killed in one laser blow. Repeatadly. The only warning was "Take these turrets! It is our only hope!" And before you ask, the turrets didn't seem to help me.\n\nThis is forgiveable however. As it is an alpha, the primary focus isn't on balance but in addition of promised features. And thankfully, there is plenty to do as you gain stronger resources.\n\nFinally, the most important component: the weapon/vehicle editor. It is clear that it is a robust system, if a little difficult to learn. I am not the most creative person, so I have difficulty putting my plans to editor. Thankfully, it is simple to download ISO files (the files that are used as "saves" for the different created objects) and install. While you are forced to download from the game's forums, this game has a pretty strong case for Steam Workshop integration.\n\nAll things together, the game is currently in a very accessable alpha. A creativity akin to Spore & Minecraft's community filters through every facet in gameplay, be it through developer or player. If you are a fan of exploration games and creative building, you won't be disappointed by this game. Even if you don't buy today, I really recommend keeping an eye on this game cause I only see it getting better and better.","March 12, 2014","true","14.1"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","1"

If it continues in it's current direction, it will be one of the best games that I have played in the last 20 years.\n\nMachine Specs:    i5 OC @ 4.4 Ghz - Nvidia 660 - 16gb 2400 Mhz\nFPS (High Settings): 60+\n\nSummary\nThe game is in an alpha - so the story line is not complete.  There is about 20 hours of playable story content, and what I have seen is extremely interesting. They have the potential to weave a great story out of this game and are headed in the right direction.\n\nIt is a hybrid of a FPS/BF1942 (Yes, the old one) land, sea, air combat - mixed into the crafty style of minecraft, splashed with colony/base management & building.\n\nThe game uses a Voxel engine, written in Unity, and while I am not always a fan of Unity 3D based engines (Mainly due to it having such a low barrier to entry - so you get alot of shotty development teams using it), but this game is written so that you would think it's using CryEngine or some custom engine. It has no signs of Unity slowness.\n\nThere is a huge technology / crafting tree..  Its not perfectly balanced, but it is so engrossing, that I think they will have no trouble balancing it. The crafting works well.. the UI is intuitive and makes it a good experience.\n\nThey have a unique system for 'scanning' for minerals - which makes finding materials much easier and helps with base/colony planning. A great idea.. and it also looks amazing.\n\nThere is a great system for crafting your own items/weapons/aircraft/boats/cars - the system is easy to use, reminds me a bit of Google Sketchup, except with voxels - and is fairly realistic in material usage, weight, and physics (IE.. heavy planes don't fly)\nThey allow you to import models from other users in ISO format - which is a great feature if you are lazy like me and really don't wan to spend hours painting and building a really cool ship. All of the importing is integrated using Steam Workshop - so its' very seamless.. It reminds me of the model importing from Spore.\n\nThe multiplayer is still immature - most servers are lowly populated - but it is an Alpha game, so I suspect that will change in the future.  It has a bit of the DayZ appeal in multiplayer, so I think this part will come around as game development progresses.  It offers Adventure, Surival, and Coop modes - but there  is no Coop for Story mode.\n\n\nGame Development\n\nThe game does not feel like an Alpha at all..  The game is fairly stable. I have seen a few crashes due to array indexing issues, but for the most part, its not bad.\n\nThe developers have pushed content on a regular basis and seem to be a very worthy team capable of completing this project. I have no fears that my cash used on this project will yield a solid product.\n\nThis is one of the few Early Access projects that I have jumped on where I feel like I immediately got a return on my investment. There is a playable demo available at their main site too..  It would be nice if they would add it to steam and maintain it, but that may not be easily done.\n\nGraphics Engine\n\nThe game uses Unity - but the graphics are quite nice.  I've done a bit of indie work with Unity 3D and until I read about it on the forums, I couldn't tell it was a Unity based game. The only real visual hint is that the frill is batched, which shows up in open plains areas.\n\nThe terrain blending is done to perfection.. mineral types make sense, the textures look realistic to the terrain (IE.. no gold rock sticking up in the middle of the terrain).  The forests are lush and all of the models are well done. The animations are 'ok' - though they could use a bit of work, but it is an Alpha, so no worries on that getting cleaned up.\n\nOn my system, it runs very smoothly - renders distant terrain without issue and feels very well optomized. It is processor intensive and uses a large amount of RAM (4gb after playing a while) - so if you have a system with less than 8gb - you will likely see some slowness loading the areas (They make heavy use of caching..)\n\nThe minimum system specs are really low.. I don't see how you could have a fun play experience with just those specs.\n\nGame Play\n\nThe gameplay is fun..  even the crafting isn't bad (I'm not a fan of minecraft/free form building). It has several game modes, Adventure, Story, and Free Build (unlimited resources) -  so it caters to a variety of play styles.\n\nI see alot of potential in the story - if they can pull it off..   Multi-content base battles.. large battleships (all destructible), very similar to the combat of BF 1942 or PlanetFall.  The best part is that it is voxel base, so the entire world is destructible/buildable.\n\nThe story starts off very slow.. I had this game in my library a few times.. thought it was just another voxel garbage game - so I didn't give it much of a chance.  If you play the story, give it atleast two hours as it can be very overwhelming at first and will easily turn you away.\n\nHowever, consider the story to be more of a tutorial on the interface.  It gets better after you get into the vehicle/guns part and actually turns into an intrigueing story of alien races/who did it/why are we here..\n\nThis game is lightyears ahead of Landmark - the only other engine I've seen come close to doing what it does.\n\nOverall.. this is one of the best games I've seen in 2014 and has so much potential and seems to be backed by the developers who can pull it off.\n\nIf you understand that the game is an alpha and that your story will most likely be spoiled by playing early (before it is complete) then this a definate buy for your library.\n\nHowever, I would recommend waiting on the story to be complete as my only disappointment in this game was reaching the point in the story where it was incomplete (I really wanted to play on.. it was addicting, fun and a great experience)","August 4, 2014","true","44.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"

Though it's not quite yet to all be realized.\nMonster Hunter is one of my favorite franchises.\nI also love Dark Souls.\nI also love Terraria, Dwarf Fortress, Minecraft, etc.\nI love jRPGs, open world games, survival, exploration, etc.\nI also love MMOs.\n\nAt a glance, this game seems to be all of those things (minus the massively multiplayer part).\nExecution-wise, it still has a bit to go.\nI'm aware it's early access, so I'm just hoping all these things get addressed soon.\n\nLarge monsters walking about, and you have the ability to craft weapons and fight them which looks like a typical\nMonster Hunter battle or a Dark Souls boss -- only mechanics have yet to catch up.\nIt feels clunky at best. The hit boxes are unclear, and the enemies don't seem to follow a set logic.\nAlso the lack of real movement options for the player -- rolling being the key one, and the lack of attack animations\nthat are conducive to this kind of gameplay really pulls the experience down.\nI found myself avoiding these fights more than not.\nIt's not a skill issue, either. I would classify myself as "good" to "Very good" at monster hunter, and "well-versed" in Dark Souls.\nI appreciate a challenging game and a challenging control interface. I like to take difficult encounters and learn them\nuntil I can beat them untouched and unharmed.\nThat being said, I found that next to impossible to do even on the easiest of enemies.\n\nThe method of combat thus far does not seem to be to outskill your prey, but rather to out-tech it with armor and weapons\nuntil its damage and defense becomes negligible to your own.\n\nExploration is fun, but could be streamlined a bit and sped up.\nBeing that it is not massivelty multiplayer, making mining and chopping wood take arbirtarily long amounts of time don't have\nany meaningful reason. It's a single player game that focuses on mining and exploration, so let the exploration feel fun.\nTune the amount you dig, the way you dig, and how fast you dig to better reflect this.\n\nThough that sounds like a lot of criticsm, I do in fact enjoy this game. I played it a lot before picking it up on Steam. I still continue to jump in and play every now and then.\nI am looking forward greatly to upcoming patches.\n\nThis has potential to be one of my favorite games.\nI'm hoping the developers pull through.","July 22, 2014","true","2.1"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

If you loved building amazing things in Minecraft out of materials that you patiently (and often painfully) harvested yourself, you'll probably love this game. It contains a lot of the things people have come to love from creative adventure/survival games and then throws nice visuals and a pretty rad story mode on it like its no big deal.\nThe game is no way polished and pretty just yet (its early access), but by playing it, you'll realize just how much amazing potential this game has. I've been following this game and playing it pretty casually for the past year and it found it really interesting how connected the developers were with their community - often seeing developers pick up on suggestions from the forums. When the game updates, the updates are usually worth checking out.\n\nMy complaints for the game are minimal and will very likely be worked out by release - things like not-so-great voice acting for NPCs in the Story Mode, the incomplete character creation section, the limited/poor sounds and music, having to hold AI companions hands a lot, and generally strange monster AI behavior.\n\nIf you're feeling iffy about the purchase, just wait for final release, It'll likely be a different animal worth way more than its current price tag.","March 13, 2014","true","10.3"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

(in my opinion)\n\nPossibilities : ENORMOUS! design your own chair, weapon, vehicle, dreadnought, spaceship, whetever the heck you want, AND USE IT IN SINGLEPLAYER AND MULTIPLAYER!

It also stops part way through while the remainder is in development- but provides circa 20 hours of gameplay currently.\n\nThe Good: -\n\nThe story mode is fun (but is orientated towards gathering and crafting).\n\nThe creation system, in which you can design weapons and vehicles (wheel based or rotor based), is the high point of the game.  Certain pre-made items are required such as a cockpit or energy cells, but beyond this you can create almost anything you set your mind upon.  Of course to use these items in game (other than in the buggy build mode) you will need to collect the materials first.  There are limitations to the system, for example, building a vast rectangle with rotors all over it will give you better overall stats than taking the time to build a realistic, aerodynamic chopper.  Look at the time I have spent in game, most of them have been spent in the creation system.  If this appeals to you, this game is worth buying.\n\nIn conclusion; this is clearly an alpha game, and as such it lacks a lot of polish and features, and is fairly buggy.  Once the development has progressed it should be great fun.","March 18, 2014","true","92.2"," 33 of 60 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","33","60","0","8"

I usually put on my own music via Google music and enjoy wandering around, getting lost and stopping to look at the world around me. This game is one of the best Ive come across for this type of gameplay.\n\nYou're thrown on to an alien world and you have to survive but things are not so dire that you have to constantly fight the entire time. It's paced wonderfully. The alien life is great to discover, plant and animals. Not every mob is out to attack on site. you can walk right up to all kinds of friendly animals, big and small, and get a closer look at them. I really like that.\n\nThere is digging, mining, crafting and all the things most everyone is familiar with by now. However, the graphics are excellent and the landscape is a smooth, sloped surface. Nothing like the blocky voxels that most games produce.\n\nI have only been playing this game for a few weeks. Got it about 3 weeks before it hit Steam so I haven't even gotten into the heart of the game by base building, multiplayer, farming and vehicle creation. But going by the first 6 hours i've played it is amazing. A game I can get completely immersed in.\n\nWith the updates the devs have planned this could be one of my all-time favorites. I searched many months for a particular game to scratch a beautiful exploration itch and I found it in Planet Exploreres. Buy this game.\n\nThe video I am sharing is from the 0.72 alpha version.

Gathering and creating is very well implemented and feels nice. The ability to custom build your weapons and vehicles is so well done that it can take hours (If you want to spend that log that is) to make something. This game still is in early access so the only complaints I have are moot because they will be addressed. First, the control of your character is blocking and weird at time, not smooth at all. Secondly, the difficulty is too high when you first start out and then you turn into god as soon as you get any decent weapon. And lastly, and I know I am being nit picky, when it rains it will show up inside your home even if it is closed up.

However, after you get into the kiting and dodging mindset and start getting confidence with the commands and the somewhat wacky interface the door opens for a whole lot of fun.\nThe game world offers lots of fighting opportunities, but the main treat of the game is undoubtely resource gathering and crafting.\nAside from the standard RUST-like crafting system with which you can craft various basic parts, armors or food, players have acces to a voxel-based editor under which you can create your very own weapons and vehicles. This is probably the funniest part of the game and you're given complete freedom over choice of shape, materials, mechanics and so on. The game then calculates the weight in each resource you've created your item/vehicle out of and prepares a crafting recipe.\nI said resource gathering: The totality of the game world can be harvested, broken, dug, chopped down - thanks to the dynamic voxel engine.\n\nAdditionally, players can create a colony -think of Terraria NPC hosting mechanics, but much deeper- which will require food, for which you have to hunt or farm, protection, and so on.\n\nOverall the gameplay is vast, rich and addicting.\n\nThe main downside is the uncompleted state of the game, which is however kept under a continous updating regibe my dedicated developers. Aside from that, the animations and graphics are kind of wacky, but the gameplay strongly makes up for it.","May 21","true","28.6"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","8","12","2","1"

The environments are gorgeous (I LOVE the bioluminescent trees and flowers), the light level at night is reasonably realistic (if you don't have light sources on you, it's really hard to see - which is as it should be imo), and the tools you use to modify the world around you work well also - shovels clear more land than picks, but yeild fewer usable resources; and unlike many fantasy games there is a good amount of medeival-style feel that for me, really accents the sci-fi nature of the game *very* well.  Swords and Guns (including Flare and Rope guns) in the same game at base? YES!\n\nIt's not the kind of game that's going to give you a ton of objectives and tedious grinding to do - there is a bit of that in story mode, but it strikes me more like a long tutorial.  I haven't yet finished Story Mode, though - I spend waaay too much time just exploring the beautiful environment and running the hell away from giant flying stingrays with lazer beams on their frickin' foreheads.\n\nThe best part, in my opinion, is the ability to start a colony and build it up from scratch, from the buildings to who gets to live there, and gardening/farming in addition to building your own guns and vehicles.  I'm a huge Harvest Moon, Sims and Dwarf Fortress fan, and this game seems to take the things I liked the best about each of those and rolls it into one lovely app. The monsters you fight will even destroy your constructed buildings so you have to be strategic when fighting on your home turf!\n\nI like how there isn't any money/gold in the game, either.  The closest thing that passes for currency is the Meat (the same kind you find on animals), and credits you get once you start a colony.\n\nThe only real gripes I have about this game is the lack of detail on the overworld map (Not so bad in Story Mode, but Adventure and Build modes appear to not have any automated mapping ability, it's just a solid blue background with icons on it.  Though you *can* automatically fast travel to your colony and other landmarks the game creates, but at this time you can't fast travel to map markers you place yourself. The other thing I get a little annoyed by is that the buildings in pre-established villages in Adventure mode can't have objects placed on them unless you've built overtop of a space with the Build tools - for example, if you want to decorate a room on the second floor of the default Hotel building, you have to use the Build tools to overlap the flooring and walls, otherwise your lamps and chairs and stuff will go straight through it.\n\nI wish it wasn't such a RAM hog, but it does perform very well aside from that, and the graphics settings actually seem to make a difference.  Very very few crashes.  Overall it's one of my favorites - been following it almost since the beginning, v 0.3x.  It's come a LONG way since then, and the devs are super dedicated.

Updates have been far fewer and less added I sadly feel the game might not survive to come out of beta, idk if its funding or lack of devalopers either way both are achiveable if the devs can put thier mind to it. e.g. cruching a few weeks into just bug fixing to move the game to beta would boost numbers and sale a bit as well as bringing some hype to the game and hiring more devs their are plenty out there that would be keen for a learning experiece even for free (cough me cough).

I've been having a blast playing it in both single player (adventure and story mode) and multiplayer with friends over the past week.

You might be to. The UI is clunky, windows don't stay where you put them, fast travel breaks things, etc etc... welcome to alpha. KEEP GOING ANYWAY. They are making a tremendous effort to voice act the whole game. I found myself actually listening to the quests. I am enjoying a storyline that is becoming increasingly compelling as you not only struggle to rescue stranded colonists but unravel the secrets of this world. It is truely a gem. However in the interest of disclosure I am playing alpha 0.752. So I will list the pros and cons given this version, so that you can decide for yourself if its worth the money.\n\nCons:\n- Alpha bugs (these will go away but player beware them) Fast travel breaks quests and resets window location. In fact theres a long list of bugs, many specific to a persons game. None of them were game breaking for me personally. Very polished for an alpha imho.\n-Mining is INCREDIBLY slow. Painfully even if you've ever played minecraft. If you think you are going to change the basic terrain in any meaningful way, you are wrong.\n-AI is often baffeling. They apear to be nearsighted and terrified of jumping over obsticals. Often I found them on an impossibly vertical surface stuck in place. Time to break out the pickace and carve em off, slowly though, because the pickaxe does nothing quickly. Or just standing around uselessly while I fire away at giant robots getting cut to ribbons by death lasers because they can't see far enough away to be useful. Same goes for turrets, which more often than not get blown up before even firing. Layerback quest is poorly designed as one of the npcs is not invincible and imediately dies unless you bury him in a hole and cover him over. Alpha is alpha.\n-VTOL (Vertical Take Off and Landing) design has basically nothing to do with reality, and a redesign of the controls for making them in general could use a looksee. You can do it, its just not easy to scale parts, and they don't go bigger than their original size... you'll see what I mean. They fly like they're on rails, and really need tuning up to 'feel' more realistic. See: Battlefield 2142 transport.\n- Geometry in general. There is no ryhme or reason for running through the base of trees. Accessing the meat from a carcase is an artform not a science. ETC. I'm guessing this is an alpha issue as well but if they don't go back soon and unfrak the situation its going to be a depressing amount of work later for the devs.\n-Grass... the amount is as staggering as it is GPU shattering. The sensativity of the levels isn't intelligent. Theres basically several options including: none, Too much, holy good god, 1fps, and the all important personal home computer melter level in case ur tired of your pc. I set it at too much. I advise you to do the same, unless you're running a quantum based supercomputer.\n\nPros:\n-Amzaing story with believable motives, and real characters, which you actually care about because its...\n-Voice Acted. Hoorah for immersion. Keep it up. Some bits are misssing here, especially when traveling and they randomly talk. I really hope they continue with this effort because everyone who's ever played another MMO has been in a TL;DR accept, kill, turn in kinda mood. This game slows it down, and makes you care, without pulling teeth. Its glorious.\n-Great Characters. Had to add this on its own. Everyone is believable, at least human-side. Very important to stay away from the classically "I'm evil, because I'm a jerk like that. No reason." *Kicks a puppy*\n-Build your own: Vehicles ground and air, swords, shields, guns, and more with a voxelbased system that with a little more time and polish will have you wondering: How do I port this to my 3d printer?\n-Mining, hunting, farming, gathering, crafting, building, sandbox explosion of fun. Some people just wanna horde a million items. Personally I think its a bit in depth, and found myself just buying the finished products... which you can do. So play it how YOU like. Something there for everyone.\n-Varied quests. Nothing is a grind, everything has a point. None of the go here kill 40 of these because I want their guts for garters crap. If you are gathering, exploring, or killing its for a reason. IE: learning to craft something new, saving a colonist who will sell you some new interesting gear, so on and so forth.\n-Hang Glider. I know you are wondering, if I've got space copters with lazer beams, why do I need a hang glider? Trust me, once you get this baby and a jetpack, you'll be sold on this game. Soaring through the trees (Which you can't run into don't worry ^.^) you'll notice the terrain is actually quite beautiful.\n-Fully developed universe. It has history, conflicts, and you get to learn about it all. More than that it effects you, and I found myself going from npc to npc just to find out more about the lore. Tedious reading goodbye. 90% voice acted so the story is 'told' by the characters who its happening to. Immersion is not just important but an expectation these days, and Pathea aims to deliver.\n-Critters. Mobs. Animals? are varied, interesting, and best of all, capracious. Initially I started with the  run and gun, and getting myself murdered, because they designers clearly favor realism, and I have the suicidal heroistic tendancies of most gamers. Then I found myself cautiously aproaching new life forms. Everything has a power level, and some are over 9000. Descretion is important, almost as much as learning to run like hell. I apreciate this, however some of you would put this in the con group. Some of you can bugger off.\n\nTheres more to it, this is a highlights list. I'm telling you I've played enough games to wonder what I'm doing with my life... and I recommend this game, even in its alpha form. Give them your money, and say goodbye to the next week until you come up for air.\n\nThis is sgmongo, signing off.","April 6, 2014","true","45.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

This is especially true if you play Adventure mode.  Not being all that into MMOs myself, I was at first a little wary.  Soon enough, however, the lovely scenery, interesting aliens, and a crafting system that has a variety of levels of depth, and I was already humming along and happily harvesting plants.\n\nThe crafting system is excellent.  There is a basic level, where you learn "scrips" and then build objects out of stuff that is in our inventory.  Then there is a deep level, where you can build any 3D object you want and it becomes available in the game.\n\nI also really enjoyed the aliens.  Especially at first, you never know what an alien is going to do till it sees you.  Then you learn really quick.  The scale of aliens is also great.  There are beings tiny like us meek humans, and towering giants that either ignore you, or quickly put you out of your alleged mysery.\n\nThis game can only go up as it gets more and more polished.

It also allows for the creation of custom weapons, vehicles, and buildings as well. My only real gripe is that it doesn't come with any premade vehicles or buildings. This is easily fixed by downloading ISO files made by other players, and as the community grows these downloadable addons will get even more impressive I'm sure.\n\nAll in all, it's a pretty addictive little game that gives you nearly complete freedom to make (or download) whatever you want. It runs great, even as an alpha. I've managed to build a rather enormous base complex (six story building, glass dome covering the area, underground tunnels leading to a nearby cliffside, hanger bay and another large stucture embedded in the mountainside..) and the game still runs just fine. So far it's only crashed when I attempt to approach the area at max speed in an aircraft.

It was great let down (granted its getting better) but this game Planet Explorer has far surpassed any expectation I hae had about a craftable game. I am barely into the game and I have already experience a huge variety of monsters, minerals, equipment. I have gotten to build a base with a defensive wall and torrents. The building and crafting system in this game is by far the best I have ever played with, even better then all the mincraft mods. The ability to import an export ISO's you and others have created are an amazing addition to the game as well, which is basically a custom crafted item. I got this on the summer sale but I would pay the full price, it is amazing this is even in alpha as it is so feature rich, I am looking forward to see the finished product. Keep up the great work guys this is amazing!","June 22, 2014","true","36.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

This is especially true if you play Adventure mode.  Not being all that into MMOs myself, I was at first a little wary.  Soon enough, however, the lovely scenery, interesting aliens, and a crafting system that has a variety of levels of depth, and I was already humming along and happily harvesting plants.\n\nThe crafting system is excellent.  There is a basic level, where you learn "scrips" and then build objects out of stuff that is in our inventory.  Then there is a deep level, where you can build any 3D object you want and it becomes available in the game.\n\nI also really enjoyed the aliens.  Especially at first, you never know what an alien is going to do till it sees you.  Then you learn really quick.  The scale of aliens is also great.  There are beings tiny like us meek humans, and towering giants that either ignore you, or quickly put you out of your alleged mysery.\n\nThis game can only go up as it gets more and more polished.  I'm happy to be in somewhere near the ground floor!","June 23, 2014","true","76.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It also allows for the creation of custom weapons, vehicles, and buildings as well. My only real gripe is that it doesn't come with any premade vehicles or buildings. This is easily fixed by downloading ISO files made by other players, and as the community grows these downloadable addons will get even more impressive I'm sure.\n\nAll in all, it's a pretty addictive little game that gives you nearly complete freedom to make (or download) whatever you want. It runs great, even as an alpha. I've managed to build a rather enormous base complex (six story building, glass dome covering the area, underground tunnels leading to a nearby cliffside, hanger bay and another large stucture embedded in the mountainside..) and the game still runs just fine. So far it's only crashed when I attempt to approach the area at max speed in an aircraft.

Still needs a lot of polish but there is already a lot of work in this and it shows. The story mode is pretty nice and plays pretty decently with what is there so far.\n\nThe survival mode isn't bad either but one thing I wish they didn't do for that was give you all the forumlas to craft things with. I like having to hunt and save up to trade with villages and traveling to buy more forumulas would have been nice for survival. Still this is an alpha level game so things can change a lot.\n\nI'm thinking you should start out survival (non-story) with just wood level tool crafting known.\n\nUpdate 7/26/2014: After playing a bit more I do have one problem with the adventure/survival mode as it stands right now. You can start out the game and not walk several feet from the village you start in and already there's a large monster (ogre?) with a club or gun mowing you down. This can be solved though by kiting it to the village for the NPCs to beat on. Still it'd be nice to have some breather space when you start out or maybe have a day/night spawn system like Minecraft for hostiles?\n\nSome updates went in since the last review as well, the game is getting better slowly so that's good.","March 15, 2014","true","48.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Once you get beyond the nice visuals, you are shocked at how bad it is. Multiplayer is atrocious and not even worth mentioning. Completely broke. Here is a short lisr of complaints in the single player.\n\n- Your own turrets target and kill your own followers\n- Can't take you followers mining, they get stuck in a hole and never get out, end up having to dig a nice smooth ramp up to rescue them.\n- larger trees have no collision detection, you can walk right into center  and through them completely\n- No collision detection. While swinging a sword you swing through the mob and end up having to stop and turn around and re-target, because its now behind you. Main attack mode is to swing at air and hope you hit something.\n- Quest box will not resize to accomidate addl quests\n- Quest box will not stay in position place indicated, always returns to the default center of screen after any action (ie fast travel)\n- Quest box will not move to end of screen if you have more than 3 cuurently\n- NPCS on escort missions are unkillable. Why am I escorting them if they can't be killed?\n- Hit boxes way to small. Chopping a tree, looting a corpse, picking a flower, all impossible unless you are perfectly positioned, takes multiple positioning attempts  to complete menial tasks like picking herbs.\n- Beds actually hurt you and not heal, tooltip lies. there is no reason to sleep, except remove darkness.\n- Food hurts you? Eating food you lose health to regain stamina, you have to eat some food then use a bandage to recoup lost health.\n- only x and y position mapped, not z, so if I'm underground mining and a monster is on surface, it kills me.\n- monsters bounce around with no weight to them. I see huge rhinos walking on top of trees effortlessly, consider making larger beasts unable to float.\n-npcs have blue exclamations over their head and no actual quests for you\n\nGeneral\n- Why is my char able to carry 9999 rock, 9999 stone, 9999 swords, and 9999 suits of armor? Storage is useless since your char can carry every single item in game on them. Nothing in the game has any weight or quantity restriction, besides the 9999 limit\n- Game is too easy. No penalty for dieing. I can craft 20 revive potions and defeat any monster in game with a wood sword. too be fun it must be a challenge. When I die send me back to a starting point, or penalize me in some way.\n- Why is ore immediately available for crafting. It should have to be smelted, refined, or processed in some way.\n-music is annoying, consider more than two 30 seconds tracks on constant loop.\n","June 17, 2014","false","34.5"," 22 of 40 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","22","40","0","0"

Massive. The first game to really drop me on an untammed planet and just tell me "Hey, heres some crap you can do, now go do crap." I feel incredibly unrestricted. This game has already more than impressed me, and I havent even managed to do ANYTHING noteworthy. Feels like the beginning of minecraft all over again; So impressed with my dirt box mudhut that I forget how awful I am and truly just enjoy the exploration.\n\nSurviving isnt exactly hard. The enemies dont exactly come searching you out, and running from most the land monsters is fairly easy... Until you ♥♥♥♥ off something bigger than you. But you learn to only make that mistake once or twice. You learn very quickly how you SHOULD act to survive. Taking damage is always very serious, and ranged weapons become your new best friend, despite how much fun I would have running around and cutting things to bits with a sick sword, the game gives me a good realistic slap in the face to remind me that these creatures are fundementally stronger than me, and will kill me in a simple swordfight through outright hurting more. Guns and bows give you the good range to distance yourself enough to have a fighting chance, and you can switch to a melee weapon to do more damage when they get there. (Though usually I panic and just jump around like an idiot still trying to shoot them)\n\nBuilding a camp isnt entirely manditory during the early parts of the game. Most of your time is spent running around and exploring. I love that. The game doesnt try to chain you down to a spot, and really enforces the idea of going and exploring. They give you scanners, and maps to help you find your way back, so getting lost isnt a huge worry either, the map has landmarks you can fast travel to and find your footing from there. And the scanner helps you find veins of ore to dig to, so you dont have to search forever to find ore, and then huddle around it thinking its the only one you'll ever find. Even still you can mark locations on your map to remind you where it is. Now you dont HAVE to explore, and it is definitely possible to hide in a small radius, but the game gives you plenty of incentive, and doesnt punish you at all for doing so. Its really all about how you want to play the game.\n\nThe building system is really cool. It is flawed in places for now, I do feel a bit restricted as I havent found a way to make rigid edges and square corners (However I could have missed that part in the tutorial, which is screens of text with pictures, kind of a scary sight for gamers these days as it has been established that reading is the bane of our existence). That said, it is a sort of lego system, but you can build weapons, shields, guns, vehicles, etc. Though Ive noticed building something cool, like a Katana for example, is somewhat punished because I could never make it as strong as any premade weapon. Same with shields. I did for a while favor the weaker weapon due to the bond I had with it, crying at enemies asking them to die faster because it looked cool (It didnt work :'<  ). In addition, I wish there were some premade vehicles that I could just use until I get the hang of creating my own, while it does make sense for my first vehicle to be a piece of crap that looks like it has less thought put into it than a dune buggy (Basically just a frame since I kept dying in game while using the build menu). All in all the building is a cool idea, and could be better with just a few tweaks here and there. Importing models made from others online would also be INCREDIBLY cool. For example, someone could make themselves some halo vehicles, or a ferarri and share it with friends online.\n\nThis game is just straight up one of the best sanbox games so far. The only thing they are missing are all the people on the sidewalks in GTA or Saints Row to run over and giggle while they go "thumbapdubabubadump" off the hood of your car. Definite reccoment, as it sits right now, its a 3.5/5 game, but thats as its incomplete form, I can forsee a 4.5 or 5/5 in the future if they keep going at this rate. Cant wait for the planned Mod Support, as you may be able to tell from my icon, I would adore some...

To the people who were swayed away from this game for that earlier statement I must say I am sorry for my Ignorance.\n\nSecondly, when I was saying the monsters are overwhelming in my review I was meaning for extremely early game players or people who, at the time, like me, did not know how the custom weapons worked, after about 30 minutes of playing most mobs will be a cake walk to kill if you spent your time in the editor for rifles.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhen I first got this I expected it to be alot like minecraft just with (proper) RPG elements thrown in.

I seriously doubt this won't be changes in the future, because it is so bad an ally will walk into the wall for an endless amount the time, same with enemys, turrents will shot into the ground if the enemy entired sight than walked into a lower point then is visable to the turrent.\n\nOne of my biggest problems is the lack of challange of "explore" mode, all crafting items(weapons, armor, so on) is giving to you off the bat, and you simply have to go out and find the mats. The enemys are randomly spawned, so sometimes a huge monster will spawn right outside the base, and the NPCs seem to kill it without taking any damage, OH and when you first spawn in you fall to your death and respawn on the spot I believe they intend for you to spawn, everytime, dont know if that is just me.\n\nFor myself, I never played this type of game, and minecraft did not interest me past day 1. But I have to say, this game looks pretty good, but I also see it getting boring after story mode ends, hopefully explore mode gets a little harder. In the end I recommend it for all the things they are throwing at you for $25 and what this game will be once it is completed.\n\nEdit 1: You can build a wall(you can build these anytime, anywhere BTW) around a monster and then  delete a single stone and shoot it from a safeISH distance away, I would like to see that fixed but I don't really know how that can be with the free build system, I don't know I suppose it is your game and you can play it how you choose. :/\n\nEdit 2: Multiplayer and more on explore mode. So I guess they have a "shop" in the right hand corner in both co-op multiplayer and explore where oh most all the items in the game are for sale. In explore mode you start right by a gold mine site every single time, I learnt this well playing legit over and over, and once I found the shop, if you clear that mine of gold out, you can buy yourself anything from the shop. Same with online co-op so it kinda just feels like easy mode. Also there is a quick travel if you did not realize. Open map and left click on a house icon.\n\nIn the end this game seems kid/noob friendly. There is no difficult part besides walking from point A to point B until you can quick travel there in story, and unless you force yourself to play the hard way you will never die/ lose a fight after the first hour or so. I still recommend it as I am hopeing for a more challenging mode/option to come out, as it stands you can play the game anyway you choice, thus making it difficult, but if you are playing on co-op I doubt anyone else will be doing the same.","March 13, 2014","true","20.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It shares a lot in common with a ton of other games in the same genre, but does a few things a bit differently and does those things incredibly well. The creation system is, hands down, one of the coolest user creation systems I've ever come across. You can, and probably will, spend HOURS building cool things. And these cool things aren't just for decoration..........you will be driving them, flying them, shooting them or swinging them. Wanna make a replica of the Millennium Falcon? Go for it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kernalgohd/recommended/237870/","kernalgohd","Kernalgohd","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kernalgohd/","247 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game is HUGE. Massive. The first game to really drop me on an untammed planet and just tell me "Hey, heres some crap you can do, now go do crap." I feel incredibly unrestricted. This game has already more than impressed me, and I havent even managed to do ANYTHING noteworthy. Feels like the beginning of minecraft all over again; So impressed with my dirt box mudhut that I forget how awful I am and truly just enjoy the exploration.\n\nSurviving isnt exactly hard. The enemies dont exactly come searching you out, and running from most the land monsters is fairly easy... Until you ♥♥♥♥ off something bigger than you. But you learn to only make that mistake once or twice. You learn very quickly how you SHOULD act to survive. Taking damage is always very serious, and ranged weapons become your new best friend, despite how much fun I would have running around and cutting things to bits with a sick sword, the game gives me a good realistic slap in the face to remind me that these creatures are fundementally stronger than me, and will kill me in a simple swordfight through outright hurting more. Guns and bows give you the good range to distance yourself enough to have a fighting chance, and you can switch to a melee weapon to do more damage when they get there. (Though usually I panic and just jump around like an idiot still trying to shoot them)\n\nBuilding a camp isnt entirely manditory during the early parts of the game. Most of your time is spent running around and exploring. I love that. The game doesnt try to chain you down to a spot, and really enforces the idea of going and exploring. They give you scanners, and maps to help you find your way back, so getting lost isnt a huge worry either, the map has landmarks you can fast travel to and find your footing from there. And the scanner helps you find veins of ore to dig to, so you dont have to search forever to find ore, and then huddle around it thinking its the only one you'll ever find. Even still you can mark locations on your map to remind you where it is. Now you dont HAVE to explore, and it is definitely possible to hide in a small radius, but the game gives you plenty of incentive, and doesnt punish you at all for doing so. Its really all about how you want to play the game.\n\nThe building system is really cool. It is flawed in places for now, I do feel a bit restricted as I havent found a way to make rigid edges and square corners (However I could have missed that part in the tutorial, which is screens of text with pictures, kind of a scary sight for gamers these days as it has been established that reading is the bane of our existence). That said, it is a sort of lego system, but you can build weapons, shields, guns, vehicles, etc. Though Ive noticed building something cool, like a Katana for example, is somewhat punished because I could never make it as strong as any premade weapon. Same with shields. I did for a while favor the weaker weapon due to the bond I had with it, crying at enemies asking them to die faster because it looked cool (It didnt work :'<  ). In addition, I wish there were some premade vehicles that I could just use until I get the hang of creating my own, while it does make sense for my first vehicle to be a piece of crap that looks like it has less thought put into it than a dune buggy (Basically just a frame since I kept dying in game while using the build menu).

I tried and bought it anyway.\n\nOf course I do not have a lot of hours, playing since 2014, because I tend to stop playing and watch the development, by the Devs or Youtubers, so I can have more accurate opinion about it and it give me the way to play.\n\nSo, speaking about the game itself: It is a sandbox, indie, open world, survival crafting adventure (that I love most). I may be exagerating if I say that this is a better Minecraft, but this is my opinion, so yeah.\n\nYou can craft components, weapons, furniture and ETC, and can build your home / base / castle / whatever. Did I mention that you can CREATE your own weapons? you can use their Voxel Tool to create the most beautiful and weird weapons and shields (weapons: sword, guns), but this doesn't stop there. You actually can create your own vehicle by the same voxel system. You have a limited box of creation, but this does not mean your creations will be limited. You can create small and large ground carriers, you can create aircraft and boats. The adventures with your own creations are so awesome!\n\nI must admit that the game have a lot missing, and I don't need to explain what is it, because, the game grow in every update released.\n\nSome may think about the update time, that it takes too long to hit Steam. I must agree on some of that, but cannot stop thinking that they are still working. I say that because I tought, long time ago (end 2014 / beginning 2015) that they gave up developing the game, because of the great delays of updates. I had uninstalled the game a lot of times, because of lack of hope, but then, I redownloaded it and played again, with new features that I didn't see it coming.\n\nNow I know one thing: they release updates, not too frequent, but when it hit Steam, the updates always come with very good improvements, and I mention bug fixes to new features.\n\nSo, pleople, don't be afeared of Planet Explorers. They are working, and the game looks beautiful.\n\nI have invested in the game and it is showing its potential so far.\n\nObs: If my words seem a little weird, I am not a native of the language, so I apologize, and no, I have nothing to do with Pathea Games.\n\nThank you and support them.","May 27","true","40.2"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

Single player is worse than it was 2 years ago in some way and only marginally better in other ways, and trying to play any mode with a friend is still the buggy waste of time it was 2 years ago.\nThe newly added co-op story mode I was excited to finally play with a friend was too broken to play too.\n\nAt this point, there are simply lots of better games to choose from that are actually going somehwere. Planet explorers has taken FAR too long to do far too little, and at this point it shouldnt cost what it does anymore.\nIts a real shame, but I don't see this game ever being done. if it ever is though, it won't even matter anymore.\nToo little too late.\n\nIts a shame the game still has the misleading mostly positive reviews just because of the great reception it got years ago.

That being said after a few hours of playing I have to say that Planet Explorers is one of those games that I feel let down with.   I followed from Kickstarter forward and had high hopes for this sandbox.  This has a lot of promiss and isn't a bad game per say.  This is one of those games that I really wish that there were a sliding scale instead of just a yes/no for recommending because I hate saying I don't recommend because unlike TUG I think the game really tries, but the problem is that I think it tries to do too much in some ways.   I think that while it has potential to be a better game in the end than GRAV right now GRAV beats it out.   I have to compare it to GRAV as to me that is the closest match as far as feel.   I will come back in a few months and review however I feel that I have enough time in the game to review and wanted to do so.   So while I am at this time not recommending I am doing so saying that while I am marking as No that I am rating as a 6/10 which is to say that the game is better than it is bad, however if your money is tight you might want to hold off.  However if you are a game collector like me and don't mind picking up EA games and being patient and willing to take a gamble I think maybe in a year or 18 months the game may change my mind.","July 4, 2015","false","3.4"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","11","19","2","0"

I'll be brief as I can.  There are some positives about this game but in a nutshell it's not ready yet for me to give it a full thumbs up.  Wish Steam had a way to give 1 to 5 stars.  If this were a star rating I'd give it a 3 for now.\n\nIt seems like it has a lot of potential.  The graphics, while a bit simple, are attractive enough, in a cute, and cartoony way.  If that look is something that appeals to you it will fit in just fine.  I don't mind that aspect but just pointing that out.  Which brings me to the first downside.  with the simplified graphics, i don't understand with a very capable gaming computer like I have, why it has stutter, quite frequently.  I would say every 20 to 30 seconds the game stutters for a moment and although it's not game breaking it is quite annoying.\n\nThe positives from my prior game plays (where I played quite a bit more time back weeks ago) I like:  the gathering, build mode and craft-heaviness of the game at least early on.\n\nThe combat could use some polish along with the gathering aspects.\n\nThe tutorial or beginning doesn't tell you much about how to do things and although I don't want hand holding for every little thing, it would be nice for the basics like how to open the replicator.  Basics like this, I know you can find in help but I will venture to guess that most players don't like to spend their early minutes in a game looking up how to do all the basic stuff.\n\nAgain, this game could be good once all details are worked out, and I will keep an eye out but for now I cannot recommend it.","February 1","false","1.5"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","57","13","23","5","0"

I haven't personally looked much at the building section of the game, which looks absolutely intriguing and fascinating.\n\nIf you want to compare it to other sandbox games like Minecraft, Terraria or Starbound, the biggest changes are that this set in a huge life-like breathing world rendered in "real" 3D (no more pixel graphics!) that you can modify and make yours to the same degree that the aformentioned titles allow you to.\nAnother big bonus is the fact that there is a single player story mode, something that very few games of this genre offer; however, it definitely feels like a game that is meant to be played cooperatively, so bear this in mind if you want to play in single player only.\n\nTrying to wrap it up: if you like crafting/sandboxing games, and if you like exploring vast, fantastic territories... give this game a shot, you'll probably like it.\n\nMy vote: 7/10 (current game state), 9.5/10 (potential)","March 24, 2014","true","9.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I haven't personally looked much at the building section of the game, which looks absolutely intriguing and fascinating.\n\nIf you want to compare it to other sandbox games like Minecraft, Terraria or Starbound, the biggest changes are that this set in a huge life-like breathing world rendered in "real" 3D (no more pixel graphics!) that you can modify and make yours to the same degree that the aformentioned titles allow you to.\nAnother big bonus is the fact that there is a single player story mode, something that very few games of this genre offer; however, it definitely feels like a game that is meant to be played cooperatively, so bear this in mind if you want to play in single player only.\n\nTrying to wrap it up: if you like crafting/sandboxing games, and if you like exploring vast, fantastic territories... give this game a shot, you'll probably like it.\n\nMy vote: 7/10 (current game state), 9.5/10 (potential)","March 24, 2014","true","9.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Unfortunately, the creator is really tricky to use for the time being.  I'm not sure it would be harder to use 3DSMax at this rate to make my first vehicle.\n\nThis is definitely in alpha.  There's no question about it.  A lot of the AI and animations has a lot of polishing left to do, the combat's hilariously clunky, and the 'storyline' isn't terribly well-balanced.  But that said, it's a fantastic start.  There's plenty to do, plenty to build, and lots of frightening spore-creator kinds of creatures to roam about and kill vicariously.

Shields and swords can be custom-designed with the voxel editor.  Buildings can be given lovely cornering and layouts, with plenty of accessories already avaioable for use.

I bought a shovel, ran out of the camp, and dug a small cave, neat! Then I equipped my dagger (I think it was) and attacked a creature that handed me my genitals on a silver platter. Then I started using some of the materials I dug up when making the cave to make a small hut (creatures are obviously not to be trifled with). About 5min into this I ran out of stamina, and I had no idea how to get it back.\n\nSo I figured I'd try out the story mode.\n\nIn story mode I found that there were some questlines to follow, they explained some of the basics, so I no longer want for stamina (or hp).\n\nThe story mode led me from hub to hub, but I'm still only scratching the surface of this because I was distracted by a looming mountain; "I wonder if I can dig a tunnel through that mountain" *2 hours later* "yeah!". There is a progression in what schematics you have available, which follows the questline. For example, the first schematics for weapons available are wooden ones, then stone, then iron.\n\nThe quests I did so far were mainly gather x/kill y/escort z ones, which for me would normally be a big "thumbs down", but in this game the backdrop steals the show, and the quests are (imo) mainly there to give you a purpose for why you venture out. I got a quest to gather 20 copper and 5 tin (I think it was) for some guy, and I ended up making a huge underground cave (mining 1000's of copper and tin in the process). I could have finished this quest in 5 minutes, and it would have been a boring gather quest, but because of how the backdrop is made I lost myself in it, and spent literally hours making my very own cave.\n\nSummary\nMost early access games hold great potential, but Planet explorers, I feel, already has the fundamental basics covered, and this is why I recommend it. It's evident that the people making this know what they are doing, and with the content I've seen so far I don't doubt that they can flesh out the rest.\n\nIt lacks polish (detailed below), but it has a solid engine. In my first 10 hours of gameplay I haven't had any crashes, and I did stuff like tunnelling through a mountain for fun (this was ~2 hours worth of drilling straight into rock), and then made a big cave where there was a copper deposit.\n\nFor anyone who can enjoy the simple pleasure it is to shape the world with your mining pick and shovel, there is already a lot of hours worth of gameplay in this game.\n\n\nCaveat\nI wouldn't recommend it yet to someone who is only/mainly in it for the combat, although this does show promise, it's definitely not balanced - you can build 10 (portable) sentries and wipe out pretty much anything by placing them quickly on the ground near the creature while it's aggressive towards you. It will however cost a lot of bullets having 10 sentry turrets firing away at the same time.\n\n\nLack of polish examples\n- not all game modes are quite ready, I recommend you start in story mode, this seems to be the most polished\n- some of the models lack the detail some other models have (people are very low-poly, but some of the creatures are gorgeous)\n- there is a help/tutorial system, but it's not very detailed, especially for some of the complex things you can do, like making your own craftable ISOs (blueprints)\n- a basic tutorial for how to "live" is needed (how to regain hp/stamina), there is a quest that explains some of it in story mode, but if you start out in adventurer mode you will be out of luck when you run out of stamina and don't know what to do (sleeping in a bed currently doesn't give stamina, I think it's intended to though)\n- a few features are not enabled yet\n- melee combat feels clunky\n\nThe help/tutorial system will likely be lackluster till much later in the developement. It doesn't make much sense to create elaborate explanations of how to do stuff when it is likely to be changed.","June 22, 2014","true","11.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Yes, BUT it's still annoying for me to play.  I'm not going to sugar-coat this game, I like the concept, but it's still in Alpha, people, and my impatience+curiousity in the game outweighed that risk factor when I was debating on buying the game.  In the end, I bought the game and here are my thoughts:\n\n"It looks like Gary's Mod, Minecraft, Skyrim put into one!"\n\nSort of, if you've ever played Space Engineers, it feels somewhat similar in controls, camera rotating, item building, etc.  I'm not the kind of guy who likes playing games that aren't incredibly fluid in controls, and despite the fact that you can still fix camera sensitivity etc., it still wasn't as fluent after a few minutes into the game.  Also watched a few gameplay vids on this and thought "what the hell, why not steam sale and I want it", but in the end, I didn't really play a lot of it since the gameplay was still somewhat annoying.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it comes with unique features like creating your own sword, being able to weild it, making designs for your own vehicles and guns from smaller pixels and detailing it nicely, but that only got me so far.\n\nSo now.. should you get the game?\n\nIf you have nothing else to buy, go for it.\nIf you're leaning more towards buying this game over something else, don't get this.\n\nKeep in mind that you'll want to put a bit of time into learning and getting used to the controls.\nThis game's controls wasn't as easy to pick up as something like Skyrim, Minecraft, or Gary's Mod. If you have patience, give it a try. If you're like me, don't bother until it's out of Alpha.\n\n*edited P.S.\nI have at least 2 hours of gameplay, but they're not showing. Perhaps I was in offline mode? But I know I spent one night on it going over a number of the game's features in adventure and building mode.\n\nAlso, don't get me wrong or take this review negatively but I really do like this game.  I like the game and I like the concept of the game, but I hate the controls and the unfluid motions.  It's definitely a recommend for those who have time as people who have made gameplay vids on these look like they're having EXTREME FUN. But I'm not like them, so I'll put this game off for a while and come back to it perhaps when they've added many updates to it? :3","June 23, 2014","true","0.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I had previously tried an early alpha demo (available for free from their website but does not do the game justice at all) and was put off by the fact that it seemingly required a click to move the mouse.  Little did I know that pressing F2 enables "shooter mode" and allows the camera to follow the mouse.  Epic.  From the moment I figured that out I was snared.\nIt is fun to play, addictive, pretty and basically everything you want in an open-world RPG sandbox game!\n\nOne of the biggest selling points is the editor/creator interface - where most games will allow you to make a simple "custom" vehicle out of snap-together parts, this actually allows you to use both simple and complex shapes combined with prefab parts to create vehicles in any shape that you like!  When you have finished designing a vehicle you save it and it gets stored in your in-game library and can be used in any game mode.  You can also share yours and download other people's if you fancy!\n\nFor me this game was the final nail in minecraft's little square coffin.  For me it was the fabled minecraft killer!  It doesn't have a huge amount in common but the things that it does (admittedly mainly mining...) are done so much better!  Smooth, voxel-based terrain makes for a much more fun digging experience and allows you to be much more creative while building defences and tunnels etc.\n\nLong story short, I cannot fault this game in any major way - but I cannot stress this enough, you still have to remember that it is an alpha version!  Although, honestly, I've paid more for mainstream games that felt less finished and polished than this one in it's current state. :)\n\nSo far of the Early Access and Alpha games I've tried out this is one of the only two that I can honestly say has impressed me to this level.  For me it draws level both in creativity and content to Space Engineers - and that is a serious compliment from me considering that I have clocked up over 230 hours into that came.  It is also clear that the developers really want to create a finished product - they usually release fixes not long after new alpha patches come out and also give a rough idea of what is to be expected in the next release.\n\nThere are obviously bugs, and certain things could be a little more well explained but honestly this game is worth the tiny amount of time it takes to master the basics!  Features get fixed and new stuff gets added with each update.\n\nSo enough of this review... I'm off to play Planet Explorers!! ;)","June 18, 2014","true","34.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

When entering orbit a mysterious manmade looking object collides with the ship leading to you and many other colonists abandoning ship in escape craft and landing on Maria's southern continent, while the ship has crashed on the northern continent. You then spend the game rounding up survivors, unravelling the secrets of Maria, the possible secrets of the crew, the tensions between the colonists from Earth and Mars, and uncovering some INCREDIBLE vistas and revelations.\n\n*Update 29/12/15* The 0.9 build was just released and so much has been improved since I last played back at 0.8.\n\n- Movement is now fantastically fluid. A couple of animation issues on certain terrain but nothing you wouldn't expect in a sandbox game.\n- Melee combat is now actually fun.\n- MONORAILS!\n- MORE STORY!\n- Fantastic improvements to the UI. They've really been putting a lot of thought into it.\n- Probably a ton of other features, I'll let you know when I've played some more!","March 22, 2014","true","54.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

With that consideration in mind, this has the potential to be an amazing game. The only problems I've noticed are that the grass and shadow textures cause all sorts of lag problems, but this can be easily fixed by turning those textures off. The other being how user friendly it is. It is really not very user friendly. There is no real tutorial, figuring out how to get stuff into the game that you made in creation mode can take awhile, and the combat system is a little odd. Keeping in mind that this is in alpha, and it is nowhere near done, I'd say that most of these problems can be fixed, and I am sure they will be even better than I could imagine in time. This game is kinda like minecraft in space, so that's pretty awesome. I also love that there is character interaction, and that the interaction will only get better.

It has held my attention for the most part.  As it stands right now there's obvious issues as it's an alpha.  The current issues I've ran into so far are as follows:\n\nThe AI has some pretty bad pathfinding.  They can get stuck on something as small as a mound of dirt.  Which makes you have to keep an eye on them during escort missions where you've ran for 10-15 mins only to realize when you get to your destination that the person you're escorting got stuck half way back.  You're able to have two companions where if they get too far behind they'll teleport next to you.  This needs to happen to escorted NPCs as well.\n\nThere's many different ways to travel, however I've only made a car.  While fun and all, they damage very easily.  This may be because it's a starting car I made but the damage accumulated way too fast.  I was only able to drive for 2 mins tops in the forest area before the car blew up.  Every small mound I went over made the car take damage.  Also I found that the cars handling needs a fair amount of tweaking.\n\nI've only just got past the kill the layerback (whetever they're called) mission.  That's where I hit my first roadblock as the quest was either unintentionally unfair or bugged as you're supposed to escort 2 survivors  to kill the layerbacks.  The one guard NPC always rushes in to melee them only to die and fail the mission.  I must have tried the mission literally 30 times, before I just built a wall around him out of harms way and only then could I finish the mission.  They need to certainly fix that as it's more than just a minor annoyance.\n\nAll in all this game has certain potential to be really good.  If you can deal with it's quirks as alpha goes along, there's definitely a lot of fun to be had.  Also the fact that you can build you're own cars, vtols and weapons with pre made parts then add voxels to add your own touch to it is really cool.\n\nWhile I don't think in it's alpha state the price is justified, it will be worth it at full release.","March 23, 2014","true","52.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I never had so much thrills thinking of how much\npotential this game has.

This indie game has accomplished far more and to a much better degree than alot of AAA titles I've played. I suggest picking it up and here's why:\n\nThe AI pathfinding is wonderful. A follower only got stuck once and that's because I was trying to build the bridge as we were walking over it and I accidently built ontop of him. So chalk that up to my fault.\n\nSpeaking of building I must say this is one of the nicest system I've seen. My only complaint is that I can't make slopes at any angle that I want, but I haven't fully examined the builder so I could've just missed it.\n\nThe voxel system creates one of the best mining systems that smoothly change the terrain as you dig and mine for minerals.\n\nThe item/vehicle creation is very nice and adds your own touch to the game.\n\nHOWEVER there are some negative point, but these might be solved as time goes on:\n\nThe ranged weapons feel inaccurate. Yes you point and shoot and it hits the target, but the pistols feel like the rifles and it all seems the same.\n\nSome claim that the melee combat is like Monster Hunter, but I disagree. You can't specifically mess up a monster's leg or wings. On top of that I haven't found a way to dodge yet so it's been a contest of who can hit harder.\n\nThere's no way to sort through the crafting menu. it's alphabetical, but if you forget that what you want is the "portible medkit" and not the "small medkit"(which I don't think there is one) then you can make the mistake of thinking you can't craft any small healing items\n\nDespite these complaints I like this game as is and the proposed additions can hopefully only make it better.\n\nEDIT: Upon review in the upper center of the replicator menu there is a way to sort out scripts.

So much to do. It is a sandbox game meaning you can do practically anything you want with out following a story line. However, there is a story and it is a good one.\n\nYou crash on a new planet with a few other scattered survivors. As in real life you have to survive and try to get off planet or\nat least hook up with others.  In order to do this you mine materials, grow food, build habitations,forts,base camps,even villages.You create tools,weapons,machines,ATVs, aircraft etc. You hunt animals for meat which is also a currency, and harvest plants for mediciane. You scan the earth for minable resources.\n\nSome of the local fauna are passive some aggressive and you need to be alert and armed where ever you go. This adds a feeling of danger and realness to the game. As it would be in real life you learn about the planet through exploration, about its creatures through study and careful approach. All have there own biorythms.  Determine the hostile ones in time and you might survive. Some attack solo, others in packs. How cool is that?\n\nThe world has many biomes, sea ,grasslands ,desert, forests and canyons. All beautifully constructed.\nThe musical score is wonderful and is still being added to as is other game content.\n\nAs is I am 50 hours into the game and have experienced no bugs. It is a joy to play.\n\nThe characters are well animated and you can create your own at start. It appears that more features will be added to the character creation in the future.\n\nThis game seems to have a little of everything, survival on a strange and beautiful world, a mysterios alien race, ruins, hostile tribals, discord within your own ranks between the earthlings and martian components.\n\nWith more content coming every month I can't wait to see what is up next.\n\nYou could spend hours just in the creation section building and awesome tank or helicopter to meet your own design standards.  Later import it in game and have your character climb on board and travel in style to any point in the game,\n\nThe game doesen't hand hold you so you get to learn and explore and create as in a real world experience. There are small tutorials that give you the basics and fire the imagination,\n\nThere is even a map that you can mark your building sites on, or locations of minerals you have located etc.\n\nThere are tools for every job, shovels, picks, axes, swords, shields, guns, bows, laser guns, armour. This means you can\nplay the game as a medieval warrior or as a highly specialized space traveller with all the gadgets or somewhere in between.\n\nThis game IMO was the best buy I have made in years.  A masterpice of fun and imagination.\n\nHats off to the developers for such a polished and entertaining product.\n","April 25, 2014","true","112.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

On a planet called Maria, which really does look beautiful and, combined with the soundtrack, I felt immersed in this strange new world as soon as I started playing. You can select from a Story Mode (where you do the story, duh), Adventure Mode (where you can...uh, adventure) and Build Mode (guess what you can do in this one).\n\nYou can speak with NPC's and do the main mission if you like, or any number of the side missions that are available. Or you can roam the countryside, looking for a defenceless animal to slaughter for their sweet, sweet meat. Oh yeah, about the meat: it is your primary trading resource. No coins, no bottle caps, no human trafficking- just the dessecated remains of your victims.\n\nCan't afford that tool or clothing? Go kill some more animals. No conscience, no worries!\n\nThe crafting system is great. You can 'shop' with some NPC's to buy your items, or you can buy their scripts. Scripts are like the blueprints of that item, and are usually a lot cheaper than buying that item outright. So it makes sense to pay for the script, learn how to craft that item by right-clicking it and then gathering the resources needed to craft it. You can gather different plants from the world (easy to tell apart because of their vibrant colours), dig huge pits in the ground in your search for minerals and cut down trees just to give Mother Nature the middle finger with both hands.\n\nNPC's will follow you as part of your team (because you always need help in butchering helpless herbivores), usually after completing a short mission for them. I have two followers at the moment, and there's nothing sweeter than hitting an enemy once before running away and letting your followers swarm them, giggling with child-like glee.\n\nThe developers are releasing updates that are quite regular, and packed with content. If you visit the Planet Explorers Steam page you can see the list of current features and ones that are being developed. An up-and-coming feature that really caught my eye: fishing. Fishing! In space! It seems this is the game that keeps on giving, especially if you want to rule over the food chain of Maria with an iron fist and make the mother of every creature stand at the window, teary-eyed and hoping their sons and daughters will make it home for another day.\n\nFinally, there is the Creation Menu. You can access this in-game, and you can pretty much build whatever your dark abscess of an imagination can conjur up. This includes guns, tools, swords, vehicles, whatever. You build something according to your desires, and it will give you a list of the material needed. If you have that material, great! The game will save it as an .iso file and then you can attempt to 'export' it into your current game. Again, you require the materials, but if you want to build a nuclear-powered, animal-chewing, meat-spitting, telekinetically-controlled orbiting Death Star that rains down medpacks evey hour, on the hour, you probably can't build that.\n\nBut you can build pretty much anything else!","June 24, 2014","true","7.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

It has held my attention for the most part.  As it stands right now there's obvious issues as it's an alpha.  The current issues I've ran into so far are as follows:\n\nThe AI has some pretty bad pathfinding.  They can get stuck on something as small as a mound of dirt.  Which makes you have to keep an eye on them during escort missions where you've ran for 10-15 mins only to realize when you get to your destination that the person you're escorting got stuck half way back.  You're able to have two companions where if they get too far behind they'll teleport next to you.  This needs to happen to escorted NPCs as well.\n\nThere's many different ways to travel, however I've only made a car.  While fun and all, they damage very easily.  This may be because it's a starting car I made but the damage accumulated way too fast.  I was only able to drive for 2 mins tops in the forest area before the car blew up.  Every small mound I went over made the car take damage.  Also I found that the cars handling needs a fair amount of tweaking.\n\nI've only just got past the kill the layerback (whetever they're called) mission.  That's where I hit my first roadblock as the quest was either unintentionally unfair or bugged as you're supposed to escort 2 survivors  to kill the layerbacks.  The one guard NPC always rushes in to melee them only to die and fail the mission.  I must have tried the mission literally 30 times, before I just built a wall around him out of harms way and only then could I finish the mission.  They need to certainly fix that as it's more than just a minor annoyance.\n\nAll in all this game has certain potential to be really good.  If you can deal with it's quirks as alpha goes along, there's definitely a lot of fun to be had.  Also the fact that you can build you're own cars, vtols and weapons with pre made parts then add voxels to add your own touch to it is really cool.\n\nWhile I don't think in it's alpha state the price is justified, it will be worth it at full release.","March 23, 2014","true","52.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This indie game has accomplished far more and to a much better degree than alot of AAA titles I've played. I suggest picking it up and here's why:\n\nThe AI pathfinding is wonderful. A follower only got stuck once and that's because I was trying to build the bridge as we were walking over it and I accidently built ontop of him. So chalk that up to my fault.\n\nSpeaking of building I must say this is one of the nicest system I've seen. My only complaint is that I can't make slopes at any angle that I want, but I haven't fully examined the builder so I could've just missed it.\n\nThe voxel system creates one of the best mining systems that smoothly change the terrain as you dig and mine for minerals.\n\nThe item/vehicle creation is very nice and adds your own touch to the game.\n\nHOWEVER there are some negative point, but these might be solved as time goes on:\n\nThe ranged weapons feel inaccurate. Yes you point and shoot and it hits the target, but the pistols feel like the rifles and it all seems the same.\n\nSome claim that the melee combat is like Monster Hunter, but I disagree. You can't specifically mess up a monster's leg or wings. On top of that I haven't found a way to dodge yet so it's been a contest of who can hit harder.\n\nThere's no way to sort through the crafting menu. it's alphabetical, but if you forget that what you want is the "portible medkit" and not the "small medkit"(which I don't think there is one) then you can make the mistake of thinking you can't craft any small healing items\n\nDespite these complaints I like this game as is and the proposed additions can hopefully only make it better.\n\nEDIT: Upon review in the upper center of the replicator menu there is a way to sort out scripts. I found that it isn't a user friendly as other sorting systems, butit does exist and makes things simpler to a degree.

So much to do. It is a sandbox game meaning you can do practically anything you want with out following a story line. However, there is a story and it is a good one.\n\nYou crash on a new planet with a few other scattered survivors. As in real life you have to survive and try to get off planet or\nat least hook up with others.  In order to do this you mine materials, grow food, build habitations,forts,base camps,even villages.You create tools,weapons,machines,ATVs, aircraft etc. You hunt animals for meat which is also a currency, and harvest plants for mediciane. You scan the earth for minable resources.\n\nSome of the local fauna are passive some aggressive and you need to be alert and armed where ever you go. This adds a feeling of danger and realness to the game. As it would be in real life you learn about the planet through exploration, about its creatures through study and careful approach. All have there own biorythms.  Determine the hostile ones in time and you might survive. Some attack solo, others in packs. How cool is that?\n\nThe world has many biomes, sea ,grasslands ,desert, forests and canyons. All beautifully constructed.\nThe musical score is wonderful and is still being added to as is other game content.\n\nAs is I am 50 hours into the game and have experienced no bugs. It is a joy to play.\n\nThe characters are well animated and you can create your own at start. It appears that more features will be added to the character creation in the future.\n\nThis game seems to have a little of everything, survival on a strange and beautiful world, a mysterios alien race, ruins, hostile tribals, discord within your own ranks between the earthlings and martian components.\n\nWith more content coming every month I can't wait to see what is up next.\n\nYou could spend hours just in the creation section building and awesome tank or helicopter to meet your own design standards.  Later import it in game and have your character climb on board and travel in style to any point in the game,\n\nThe game doesen't hand hold you so you get to learn and explore and create as in a real world experience. There are small tutorials that give you the basics and fire the imagination,\n\nThere is even a map that you can mark your building sites on, or locations of minerals you have located etc.\n\nThere are tools for every job, shovels, picks, axes, swords, shields, guns, bows, laser guns, armour. This means you can\nplay the game as a medieval warrior or as a highly specialized space traveller with all the gadgets or somewhere in between.\n\nThis game IMO was the best buy I have made in years.  A masterpice of fun and imagination.\n\nHats off to the developers for such a polished and entertaining product.\n","April 25, 2014","true","112.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

On a planet called Maria, which really does look beautiful and, combined with the soundtrack, I felt immersed in this strange new world as soon as I started playing. You can select from a Story Mode (where you do the story, duh), Adventure Mode (where you can...uh, adventure) and Build Mode (guess what you can do in this one).\n\nYou can speak with NPC's and do the main mission if you like, or any number of the side missions that are available. Or you can roam the countryside, looking for a defenceless animal to slaughter for their sweet, sweet meat. Oh yeah, about the meat: it is your primary trading resource. No coins, no bottle caps, no human trafficking- just the dessecated remains of your victims.\n\nCan't afford that tool or clothing? Go kill some more animals. No conscience, no worries!\n\nThe crafting system is great. You can 'shop' with some NPC's to buy your items, or you can buy their scripts. Scripts are like the blueprints of that item, and are usually a lot cheaper than buying that item outright. So it makes sense to pay for the script, learn how to craft that item by right-clicking it and then gathering the resources needed to craft it. You can gather different plants from the world (easy to tell apart because of their vibrant colours), dig huge pits in the ground in your search for minerals and cut down trees just to give Mother Nature the middle finger with both hands.\n\nNPC's will follow you as part of your team (because you always need help in butchering helpless herbivores), usually after completing a short mission for them. I have two followers at the moment, and there's nothing sweeter than hitting an enemy once before running away and letting your followers swarm them, giggling with child-like glee.\n\nThe developers are releasing updates that are quite regular, and packed with content. If you visit the Planet Explorers Steam page you can see the list of current features and ones that are being developed. An up-and-coming feature that really caught my eye: fishing. Fishing! In space! It seems this is the game that keeps on giving, especially if you want to rule over the food chain of Maria with an iron fist and make the mother of every creature stand at the window, teary-eyed and hoping their sons and daughters will make it home for another day.\n\nFinally, there is the Creation Menu. You can access this in-game, and you can pretty much build whatever your dark abscess of an imagination can conjur up. This includes guns, tools, swords, vehicles, whatever. You build something according to your desires, and it will give you a list of the material needed. If you have that material, great! The game will save it as an .iso file and then you can attempt to 'export' it into your current game. Again, you require the materials, but if you want to build a nuclear-powered, animal-chewing, meat-spitting, telekinetically-controlled orbiting Death Star that rains down medpacks evey hour, on the hour, you probably can't build that.\n\nBut you can build pretty much anything else!","June 24, 2014","true","7.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

Then you learn to make your own guns. At this point I took a sidestep from the quests, and decided to settle on this planet like my forefathers settled 'Merica, by killing everything in sight.

There are a few querks with equipping items and where they show up in your inventory (personal opinion, certainly doesn't affect gameplay).\n\nThe iso creation system is, in my opinion, what really sets this apart from other sandboxes. Not only can you create your own things out of blocks, but you can create your own useable items - vehicles, weapons, objects. The interface is a little intimidating at first, and isn't the most intuitive or user friendly, but once you get the hang of it, you can do some pretty amazing things! I'd like to see more data displayed while in the iso creator, but we're in alpha, and there's lots of development to go.\n\nOverall, it's a beautiful game with some very innovative ideas.

Planet Explorers plays like an RPG, crafting game, exploration, adventure, even a 3D modelling program!\n\n* It's like Elements: You start with initial resources like plants and minerals, and can craft new technologies & accessories.\n* It's like an RPG: Beautiful open world, small & large enemies, Obtain missions by talking to NPC's, some of which can join your party and eventually your colony (city)! They will fight with you & you can equip them with weapons, armors, items, or just give them stuff to carry.\n* It's a sandbox: make tools to help you dig out the world. Search for ore deposits using your 3D scanner then use them to construct just about anything! (not player-designed clothing)\n* It's 3D modelling software: Construct swords, shields, guns, land/sea/air vehicles, or just decoration objects like stairs, utilities, household, really anything you can think of!\nCustom models are inserted into the game like this: If you have the resources required to build it, they will automatically be removed from your inventory and the object will appear. You can interact with it or pick it up anytime that you are next to it. An 'approved' build that has been picked up may be reused until it is destroyed; once it's built, it's built.\n\nI have spent over 10 hours on Story mode so far and I have only just built my first car.

Doing a huge update and then finding your saved games are trashed is VERY irritating.\n\n2. Better communications from the dev's, we are people too that understand that life and especaily software developement does not follow a straight path as such if an issue hits the game a quick note to say "hey we got an issue to sort out watch this space" is much better than us ranting on the forums and the dev's getting back to us 3 days later.\n\nNow for the amazing bits of the game:\n\n1. the creation system once you have understood it is one of the best ideas in this game with total freedon to do what you want this is a huge plus 1\n\n2. Total freedom to do what you want. This is another huge plus 1. In adddtion to the diversity of the terrian the options are there for some wonderful game play\n\n\nIn conclusion this is one game that has endlees potencial but I would councile the dev's to be careful as the sandbox genre of games is expanding fast and as such this game needs the updates comeing once a week instead of when the dev's think their ready.

If you like exploration and get a nice vibe from hard-sci-fi-ish stuff, then this is for you. I like that it has a story and characters and that it's not all procedurally generated.\n\nHowever, there are problems. Why, in a sci-fi game, do we still have to craft wooden pickaxes, axes, shovels, etc, like in Minecraft? The main problems with this game are the hold-overs from the Minecraft formula. They don't find whatsoever in this game. Just give me a laser cutter or something like that. It's just silly crafting wooden, bronze, iron, etc tools. The feeling of mystery was also a bit ruined for me when, while exploring, I ran into a huge fortress with hostile aliens, but upon my return to the camp where the other colonists none of them acknowledged the discovery - immersion breaking.\n\nThere are some great ideas here and the technical implementation is great. It looks amazing and the voxel engine works very well. I'm pretty sure I could do without the mining and things, however, and there should be some careful constraints on the pacing for the game if there is to be a cohesive story. Overally I recommend it because I had fun playing it, but obviously it still needs a lot of work as it's still in Alpha.","March 28, 2014","true","4.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was a bit nervous going into the game after some of the reviews I've read. I have to say, I am very glad I got this. It is very good for an pre-alpha release, with a sleek design and custom crafting. The gameplay certainly has a learning curve, but it makes sense pretty soon. I recommend control setup 2, so that you don't hold right click to turn view. This won't be a full game analysis, but I would recommend the buy, even at this stage of development. The updates are long apart, but quite large. Overall, I'd give it a 7/10, but that's because it's in alpha. With a bit of AI improvement, a lot of optimization, and a fix for the memory leak, this game would be 9/10. As of right now, it still sits at a 7.\n\nA problem I have with the game is the crashes. I see some people complain about constant crashes, but luckly I don't have that issue. I only crash when closing the crafting screen, making it impossible for me to use the custom crafting. It sucks because it means I have to walk everywhere, but the game is still very playable.","July 11, 2014","true","25.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Recipes can be accessed in the replicator, you've got a handheld computer you can use to scan for...something, I dunno yet.

It's the first game in awhile that gave me that feeling of actually having a new experience. The world they created is captivating and definitely compels me into exploration. There is a great crafting system, and most items, clothes, vehicles and weapons are crafted from the materials obtained from mining. The main story is also good as it leads to character through the different biomes. There are tons of different monsters, located in different biomes, and even underground caves filled with dangerous critters and rare ores.","May 10, 2014","true","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

More invironments, more things to do, and more work required by the designers.  Both PE and SE have volumetric destructible environments and player-built square blocks everywhere, which can be destroyed easily by enemies.  But PE tries to have a whole Story (actually a series of linked quests), AI enemies and helpers, and a world-based environment as opposed to asteroids.  Planet Explorers also tries to have you build up a colony.  It also channels a bit of the MMO Calypso, but with a colony that is just starting, rather than well underway.\n\nRegards A0.7.5.2:\nIt is Alpha, and Unity based.  Highest graphical settings on OpenGL are not recommended, but DirctX is fine so far.  There is little optimisation as yet, and multiplayer parties should stay together as digging info is not correctly remembered by all clients if they are far apart.  But there is a lot of expectation, and a playable game as it stands.  I just hope that when they say the version number, (currently A0.752, or in the game 0.7.5.2) that they don't stop when the second part reaches 10.  Most basics are there, and now they need QA and more additional stuff regards the world size and colonies.","March 22, 2014","true","115.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

They work on the game a lot adding new features and enemies, it's definitely a game to get, you can build structures, completely create your own vehicles and weapons/gear.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dustymonster/recommended/237870/","dustymonster","Dustymonster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dustymonster/","116 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n-NOTE: This review is for a game in alpha!\nVery unique game with tons of creative ideas, but as it is in alpha, these ideas lack a lot of flare, and are very underdeveloped. In fact, all the game's ideas (not to mention the whole game itself) is packed to the brim with bugs and errors. The story mode is something I consider awful. The voice acting for all NPC's and keystory characters is annoying, and really feels like something you'd find at a high school acting club. The missions are all tedious, and rarely go beyond the MMORPG tropes of "kill X of Y" or "Collect X of Y". This is especially disheartening considering this is a singleplayer storyline, and yet it lacks anything to really intrigue me for longer than an hour. The multiplayer is glitchy as hell. Sometimes I'd be able to join a server, but most of the time this wouldn't be the case. Even when hosting my own server, something I've had a lot of experience with, the connection is very unreliable, working around 50% of the time. Now I'm positive this isn't an error on my end, as I actually have a personal server in my home, have hosted private servers for numerous games, and followed the game dev's official server setup instructions to the letter.... twice. Even if I am able to connect to a server, be it my own or someone elses, in multiplayer, there is no way to control where you spawn, meaning you and your friends will be in entirely different villages and required to shlepp around until you find each other making it very, very tedious. The create mode is the true selling point of this game. The create mode is incredibly easy to use, and almost reminds me of a dumbed down version of Solidworks, a 3D modeling program I used to use quite a lot. That being said, it is still very unrefined and lacks a lot of the flare to create anything more than some basic cars or guns without spending hours in it. There are so many tools missing from the overall creation experience, that many things are so complex to create in this 3D modeling software. This is extremely frustrating since I know that I could easily make a lot of this stuff using the vastly more advanced tools of something like Solidworks, or hell, even the Microsoft 3D modeling software. Also, there is no options for zooming besides using a mouse wheel which is annoying since I'm so used to modeling with a trackpad. This game does have a lot of potential for sure, and I will be looking at it again in beta and the final version, but as it stands right now I couldn't reccomend this at all. If I had to give this game a score, which I probably shouldn't given it's not even in beta, I'd have to give it a 4/10. Avoid this game like the expensive plague. Also, a word of advice to all "early release" developers. Please sell your alpha games at a discount. Usually you have to pay people to play such glitchy monstrosities, and it's something I deeply regret that I paid full retail for this junk heap.\n\n\nEDIT: Grammar corrections.","August 9, 2014","false","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The fact that its still not finished and that i cannot play on a LAN with my friend without an internet connection have made me change my review from a positive to a negative.  Im sick and tired, as a paying customer, to make sacrifices in the name of DRM.  I have a detached garage with no internet access that I use for LAN parties.  The trend is these days is to require internet access so that all players have a valid copy.  I understand the desire to get paid for hard work, however, this only punishes paying customers.  For example, Diablo 3 requires an internet connection for the offline single player campaign.  Horribly intrusive for the paying customer hoping to play on the go, but a hacked version was released on ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ within hours of the release of the game that didn't require an active internet connection.  The pirates actually got MORE playability on this one.\nI will not dig a 200 ft trench to install lan cable to my garage, nor will i try to get a stable wireless connection to transmit that far.

It manages to captures the essence of frontier planatery exploration while allows for a very playable game. When they say it's a sandbox game, they mean it.

You can play it like minecraft, building elaborate structures. You can play it almost like spore, creating interesting designs. Or you can even play it like a management game. The wealth of possibilties was something that really took me back.\n\nWhat is most important however, is that it is still an early access game, but it doesn't play much like one.

I’m just starting on the crafting tree, once you learn to click on the scripts then you can replicate items – it’s a breeze. Easier than Minecraft in that you don’t have to select each resource, drag it to the crafting table then craft it. On the Con side the character movement controls – it’s not as immersive as minecraft. I might have missed some control configuration but I’m definitely do not like the way it’s done. I’ll keep playing around with to see if it’s a configuration.  Also chasing down NPC to talk to them and missing them and having to chasing them down again was a pain – funny – but a pain. ;)\n\nOverall I would recommend it (if the movement controls can be improved) the game has a lot of potential.\n","March 19, 2014","true","3.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Who wouldn't?.\n\nThe game is great, and for a price of 22,99.. hell yeah.\nI've been playing the game for 44 hours so far, and I can't get enough.\n\n\n%Environment-\n\nThe world itself, feels incredibly smooth.\nThe leaves dancing around, as you walk through the forests.. just awesome.\nIt sort of.. brings the place more to life. It's all about the little things :3\nAnd let's not forget the nature..\nThey've done a really good job, since it's set on a different planet, many lightyears away;\nIt'd only be logical to make a new type of nature, instead of the basic trees and flowers we see everywhere.\nLet's take one of the tree's as an example :D - The C which fell. <- apparently what I call it >:o.\nLike, it's literally a tree formed as a C, but with both ends in the ground; with a few branches sticking out here n there.\nI personally haven't seen that one before.\nAnd the awesome flowers which again doesn't seem like everyday flowers, but neither too fantasized..\nSome are quite huge and others are tiny; but they're all pretty well made.\n\nFor an alpha release, this couldn't possibly get any better.\n\n\n%Characters & Customization-\n\nI'm all in for customization and eye candy.. I'm just that type of person.\nBut in this case, it actually doesn't hit me as hard as in other games..\nThe Character Creation System isn't too advanced(at the moment.)\nBut you're still capable of giving your character a personality.\n\nCurrently there is;\n\n-FEMALE-\n5 Female Face Types.\n15 Female Hairstyles.(+any colour) (not bad for an alpha, huh?)\n1 Female Voice.(no menu)\n1 Body Type. (Though you can colour your skin to almost any colour you want.)\nAnd an empty "Other" tab(wonder what'll be added here :D)\n\n-MALE-\n4 Male Face Types.\n11 Male Hairstyles.(+any colour)\n1 Male Voice.(no menu)\n1 Body Type. (colour applies here too of course.)\nAnd the "Other" Tab.\n-\nThe characters aren't super HD looking in the Char Creator.\nBut in the game itself, they're quite good looking.\nPlus with the visually shown armor types in-game, you won't need much more :).\n\n\n%Game Modes-\n\nFor an alpha release, they sure have a lot for us to toy around with....\nThe game currently has three -(+VS Mode online)- game modes in the alpha release;\n\nStory Mode (you follow the storyline + free roam..)\nAdventure(+ VS Mode online) Mode (open world free roaming, where you decide what to do)\nBuild Mode (exactly what it sounds like..)\n\nI won't go indepth with the game modes themselves..\nThough I will say that my favorite mode, is Normal Adventure Mode(non-VS) online.\n\n\n%Creation System-\n\nThis feature right here... FREAKISHLY AMAZING.\nIt's like an in-game simple to use modelling program.\nSo far it's possible to make:\nSwords.\nPistols.\nRifles.\nSmall vehicles.\nLarger vehicles.\nHelicopters.\nVTOLs.\nBattleships(30x60x28 meters..'if i remember correctly..') (flying ones.. not a boat D:)\nAnd Tiny, Medium and Large Objects.\n\nAnd the best part of this feature? you can import your creations right into the game.\nWell, yes in singleplayer, you might say.. NOPE.\nThe online multiplayer servers have an upload/import function, when you launch the creation system within them.\nAll of the creations require their respective materials to be made though.\nEngines, metal, sword hilts.. fuel.... etc.\nAll something you have to have in your inventory, before you're able to import your creations.\n\nNow, this feature is too big for me to indepth with.\nIt's something you have to toy around with.\n\n\n%Minecraft Comparisons-\n\nHere we go.. another minecraft clone. Right? - Oh hell no!!#$@&^\nThis epic piece of work deserves its own place in the spotlight.\n\nI don't get why every single game, where crafting and resource gathering is available -\nhas to get compared to Minecraft.. It's truly sad to see the current generation of gamers and casuals..\nAnd for some reason, everyone seems to forget that roughly 65% of minecraft is community made.\nI know of nobody who play Minecraft Vanilla singleplayer/multiplayer anymore.. Nobody..\nEveryone plays on modified servers which were made by the community..\nNotch made the base game, we made the rest.\n\n\n%Review-\n\nThis is only a lite-review.\nI will do a proper in-depth review of the game, once it has been released in it's 'final' state.\nExcluding updates of course. Well, perhaps a hotfix or two, after the release. (something always go wrong..)","March 19, 2014","true","73.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I'm finding few bugs/goofs, however.  What I am finding is the game I've been wanting to play since Minecraft "got old".  There is, obviously, lots of exploration, colonization, and creating of everything from a wooden sword to a jet with frikkin' laser beams.\n\nPE offers two gameplay modes, story and adventure.  I shied away from story mode at first, as I was suffering from mmo quest burnout - I can't play any of these mmos coming out that are all quest based for more than 3-4 weeks before I give up.  But the questing in PE makes sense, and a lot of times the quest rewards advance your tech and allow you to build bigger and mo' betta things.\n\nAdventure mode is pretty cool, too.  You basically start off with a small settlement with 7 or 8 settlers, access to every item in the game via a trade button on your screen, and knowledge of all the tech.  I would have thought this would be the mode for me, but since all one needs to do is collect meat (the currency) and buy whatver one wants, there's no real reason to craft things and no sense of achievement.\n\nAnyway, I definitely recommend this game - I've gotten three or four of my friends to snag it up, and am looking into putting up a multiplayer server fairly soon.\n\nHope you folks enjoy this game as much as I've been.\n\nCheers!","June 1, 2014","true","40.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You can create vehicles to travel/battle creatures, manage colonies, setup automated defenses and attract monsters to them.  I have been playing this and EQNext.  Neither game is finished, but this game has many more features.  There are some stability issues and it has not been optimized for performance, yet.  So, if you have a low end PC, it may be wise to wait until it releases.\n\nFast forward 2 years, and I'm still hopeful it all comes together.  The crowds are growing turgid with negativity by spewing comments about how much money they have pulled in.  People obviously do not know how much developers and designers cost.  A Jr. Dev, that will work at a much slower pace and produce bugs, starts around $60k/yr.  A Sr. Dev, that should work much quicker and more efficiently has no necessary cap on their costs, but it usually floats around the $100k/yr area.","April 23, 2014","true","227.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Still alot of work to be done but they have done so much to bring this into a "stable" early access program. It's way too easy to sink hours into this game. With the first person, it's very immersive and with the vehicle and weapon crafting, dynamic weather and time, music, environments, it's easy to get lost in the world and the story. You want to engage in every dialogue to know more of the story and sometimes the npc's give you something for essentially just listening to them. You can sink hours just in mining to create a weapon all your own design and the reward of creating a master lazer rifle is worth the grind. A good number of bugs, but the devs have been active lately with addressing them and progressing the story. Ive spent hours creating and building a Wrangler Unlimited and vtol passenger carrier, and to watch them work correctly and help to get around the map so much faster is amazing. I never post a review or opinion, but it's worth giving the devs credit. Keep it up Pathea.

Glorious 3D environments with vibrant flora and fauna sprawling in all directions greet players first thing out of the gate, complete with a skybox full of planets and stars at night. The spirit of adventure takes center-stage, with a massive open world to explore and several modes of travel with more on the way. System to design custom swords and guns is implemented and looks versatile, but seems to require some getting used to, as with the UI for designing and erecting buildings. Running and jumping animations are somewhat clunky, and character customization is minimal for now, but these things are all minor problems surrounding what looks like a game with vast potential.

What is particularly unique about it is the cad-cam style crafting interface that theoretically allows you to build anything you want out of your own user-defined shapes and utilizing in-game mechanical and electrical components.  In addition to crafting, there is resource gathering, hunting, enemies to kill, and discovery of new areas on the map.  I would probably play this much more often but as building and harvesting take a lot of time, I have kind of shelved this game until it is a little more updated.  Its a bit of a pain to build something extensive and then have to start over because of patch incompatability.  If you are patient about patches and love these kind of open world survival games, I would recommend this, but I might also suggest waiting for a more complete build.","December 30, 2014","true","57.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

You really are only confined by the limits of your own imagination.\n\nHaving been playing the single player mode since Alpha 0.81, there are issues in multiplayer that really need addressing (A0.831 being the latest version at the time of writing). Also given that this is still in Alpha I cannot stress that these are issues that will eventually be resolved in due course.\n\nUndoubtedly the biggest issue thus far has been that hosted servers do not always save your progress. You can spend hours upon hours creating things (which luckily you can save as isos to use again at a later date), but if you're unfortunate enough not to be able to do this and your server fails to either save or to appear on the server list, then all your hard work will have been for nought.\n\nThe game also has a tendency to spawn your character underneath blocks you've already placed, which is no better demonstrated than logging into the game and finding your character face-deep in the dirt under your house. This latter point is obviously an issue regarding optimisation that can easily be resolved, though servers not saving your hard work is a much more serious issue.\n\nWhile single player 'story mode' and multiplayer 'build mode' seem quite stable, multiplayer 'adventure mode' on the other hand seems very buggy by comparison.\n\nIn spite of all this however, I'm very happy to say that the potential of this game is such that it warrants further and continued interest on my part*, though I may update this review as and when necessary. 4.5/5\n\n--------\n* The game has been so promising that I bought extra copies for my friends.","August 13, 2014","true","45.0"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

I've tried to wrap my head around it, and even though in some ways I can see the pros, ultimately I have to feel as though it's in direct violation of the Early Access Program rules of Steam.  Now, I'm not trying to go out of my way to make trouble for the developers of this game... I truly think it has tons of potential, tons of possibility to do well, and I just wish they'd get their heads out of the butts and iron out the core features like CONTROL INPUTS for the CORE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE GAME (and before anybody says that controller-support isn't a core function... it's LISTED in their INPUT section under the CONTROL menu, with some Joystick buttons even listed as defaults, while only half of an entire gamepad/joystick works, but also interferes with Xpadder/Pinnacle working properly -- there are quite a few people that have medical issues, myself included if you count aches/pains from old age, that can only comfotably game with a controller... most times I even use a controller to navigate through the OS and such... Unity HAS built-in controller support, so either iron it out, or turn it off so people can use XPadder or Pinnacle!!!  Buyers have been asking/begging for it for OVER A YEAR NOW!).  Anywho, here's what's chafing me... Steam's Early Access is about ANYBODY that pays for early access, gets to experience the game as it goes.  Planet Explorer's decided to make an Alpha-Beta team I guess.  And no, I'm not "butt-hurt that I couldn't be on the team"... as far as I know you just have to opt into it, and anybody in EA can do that as far as I'm aware.  It just blows my mind though, that first you have to pay for EA, expecting to get all patches and updates as they happen, and then a SUB-GROUP is made within that EA for "BETA-TESTING" of an ALPHA!?  WTH!?  Every EA I've played to date, I haven't had to babysit "how I get my patches and when"... when updates are made, you just get them auto-patched via steam.  Now, GRANTED... one of those pros... having a beta-team makes sure it's nothing that will outright break and destroy the game when a patch is pushed, but that's what internal Q/A is supposed to be for; (Or even... I dunno, early-access!?).  So now, of all people that pay for EA, hypothetically 50% that are in beta get the latest "beta updates" as they happen, while those that didn't know or couldn't be bothered to opt into beta, have to WAIT until the devs decide the "alpha patch" is up to "alpha standards!?" before they release it.  Perfect example... I haven't opted into the beta-testing, but I launch my PE game right now, and my currently running and available public version is 0.871... yet, on the steam page for PE, I even quote, the most recent patch is "A0.886 Beta Build Released on Steam" (this isn't flipping WoW with their PTR for crying out loud... this game isn't even in full freaking release yet!!!).  See what I mean!?  When has there ever been a BETA within an ALPHA/Early-Access!?  How long does time have to go on before we have so many silly sub-levels to early-access/beta-testing before it's just too absurd to make anymore sense of!?  "Oh yeah, I'm an alpha-access beta-tester to the early-access beta-alpha which is in place to iron out all updates before they hit the closed-alpha-beta-alpha to ensure that everything is ironed out when the game goes beta-alpha-beta in a couple more months"... WTF!?\n\nWell, game seems decent, interesting, fun and procedurely-generated.  Lots of potential in this title.\n\nBiggest downside though is, been sitting on this title as it collects dust because of all the so-called "upcoming improvements and fixes".  Controller-support in this game is horribly broken, so much so that you can't even use Xpadder/Pinnacle to map out a custom-config... since the game semi-initiliazes control of the controller/joystick with no options to turn it off on the game-side of things.  Wouldn't be so big an issue, except for people like myself where playing constantly with a mouse and having to sit forward all the time start to kill my back and wrist after awhile.\n\nWouldn't fault the game so much for having broken controller-support... but be nice if devs either got controller-support accurate, or just left it alone so people could again jury-rig their own support via Xpadder/Pinnacle... as it stands it's a giant speed-bump/road-block.\n\nOther than that, everything else about the game seems to run somewhat decently and looks really fun... just a shame that those that might require sitting back with a gamepad can't exactly dive right in... been really longing to play this game more.  And for that reason, I can't exactly recommend it... as others might find themselves in the same predicament as myself.  Not everybody has tons of money, and in this day and age several live on a tight budget... with so many broken/problematic games, people want to feel comfortable and confident that they can make a leap of faith in buying what looks and seems to be a half-decent game.  Problem is, gaming controls/functionality are a core-element that by now designers and developers should have figured out... it's not rocket-science, it's not like anybody's reinventing the wheel.  So for the sake that nobody drops the clams on this to find out, as I did, that they're simply unable to play it the way they want to and for a decent amount of time in one sitting, I can't exactly outright recommend this, at least, not without putting a huge WARNING out there.\n\nWARNING: If you're able to play for long hours with a keyboard/mouse this game may be okay for you... if you typically need to jury-rig up another input-interface/controller-setup either in a game or jury-rigged outside the game... WAIT and SAVE YOUR MONEY until they confirm there's some sort of fix or update to this. -_-","July 11, 2015","false","14.8"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","53","10","19","3","0"

Playing, it feels like the developers are still unclear on what they want to do with some features. From what I've played, quests have been simply going from point A to a very far point B then back, or gather X amount of resources A, B and C, or a combination of the two. They are long, tedious and do little to keep you wanting to play more.\n\nThe crafting system is decent, but very early on, you'll get very complicated scripts that require you to create many different materials from many different resources in order to create a single Item. It wouldn't be so bad, if resource gathering was fast and entertaining, which it's not. early tools take ages to gather resources, and you're stuck with them until you figure you have to buy more scripts from an NPC.\n\nThe combat system is barely worth speaking about. If you don't notice the little enemy health bar that appears in the upper left corner of the screen, you won't even know if you're landing any strikes or not, until either you or your enemy are down.\n\nYou can put items for use in the 1-9 bar, a la Minecraft, and it works well, but the only way to know which Item you have equipped is by looking at the square left of button 1, which shows what you're currently using. I guess that's ok, but it'd be less confusing if it just highlighted the Item you've selected. Another problem is that if you're using a sword and Shield and you change to a pickaxe to do some mining, when you switch  back to the sword, the shield will stay unequipped, forcing you to go and equip it again, which can be annoying considering how you can be attacked at any time.\n\nOne other problem I had is that throughout the time I spent playing, I felt like I was doing something (or rather everything) wrong. Following the questline brought me to face enemies against whom I had no chance. I constantly wondered if there was something I missed, something that should have prepared me for the challenge, but there seemed to be nothing there.\n\nOverall, the game has potential, but I cannot recommend it to anyone, simply because it's too unfinished. I wish I had waited a year or two more to play it in a much more polished state. I know I'll have to wait at least that long to come back to it.","June 29, 2014","false","1.5"," 19 of 37 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","19","37","0","0"

You are just given the plans to make ever item in the game, when you start. And if you dont want to make them there is an always available shop menu.\nFarming isnt worth doing as you buy a seed, plant it, wait, harvest and then just get 2 of the crop. Then you have to buy another seed. As the crop item can usualy be bought at half the price of the seed. You may as well buy that and not wait.\nColony building consists of building 5 to 7 items and placing them, then getting a few people to "live" there. You then supply them with food, water, armour, weapons, assign them a job working the farm. Then thay stand around doing nothing all day.\n\nWith All that said, this is one of the most promising games I have seen all year. Graphics are almost perfect for the game. Mining is even challenging. Combat is fun although needs tuning a little. Stability is almost perfect with one crash in 24 hours gameplay. Making your own designs of vehicles works fantastic. Using the rocket pack to gain height, then switching to hanglider and gliding around is almost a game in itself.\nAnd yes I understand this is an Early access game, but one of the keywords is Game, and currently there isnt enough game to play, and make this worth buying at this price. This is at present an alpha demo and should probabily be free. If you want to support the creators then buy it. Otherwise wait, and keep a close eye on it. If Its finnished, it will be good.","March 21, 2014","false","25.2"," 44 of 87 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","44","87","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/asharwood/recommended/237870/","asharwood","ASHarwood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/asharwood/","235 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWith 20hrs under the belt I can safely say that this game is fantastic.  There is so much to do and so much life to the game.  I will break it down by features.\nGraphics:\nThe graphics are great.  There isn't as much control over what features pertaining to graphics are used but enough to make sure your system can run it properly.  At full quality it looks stunning.  Light permeating through tree leaves, a nice not-over-done bloom effect, AA, it all works great and runs smooth.  Very pleasing to the eyes.  The voxel engine handles very well and even with an older video card, the game handles it all very well and even displays very far into the distance (im using a nvidia 560ti).    The weather is handled very nice and looks good.  Night time is actual night time.  You can hardly see at pitch black and need a torch or light.\n\nCharacters:\nIt is great that they allow you to create your own custom character like sims or elderscrolls games.  The NPCs are active but not to the extent of say skyrim where they have jobs.  They sort of just stand around and walk here and there. You can talk to them and get a lot of story background which is great.  You can even enlist some of them to fight beside you and you can equip them with armor and weapons and whatnot.  The mercenaries have their own set of special skills too.  Some are great with swords and others with guns and so on.  Adds nicely to who you choose to follow you.  I like that the mercenaries reappear beside you when you get too far from them.\n\nStory:\nGreat story line.  Makes you want to learn more and more about what is going on.  This coming from a guy that usually is not interested in story.  I found myself wanting to know what happened.  That doesn't happen often at all.\n\nSound/music:\nThe sound was good.  The music adjusted appropriately depending on where you were and whether or not you were in the area of a hostile enemy. It was a little glitchy but I've read they are fixing that.  Sound effects fit weapons and whatnot.  It could use more attention to vehicles and sounds but overall still good.\n\nQuests:\nThe quests are your run of the mill quests.  They are good and add to the the story.  They don't always feel quite at all like a grind.  Some can be, but that is normal it seems.  Other quests are more detailed.  I will say there are some bad bugs with some of the quests that require a npc to follow you.  That npc is prone to get stuck at a tree or rock and unlike the mercs that you hire, the quest npcs don't reappear at your side if you move too far away.  I have found that if you have a quest npc with you, if you bring out a vehicle and get in it, the npc will rellocate to your vehicle which is an unintended fix.  This leads to problems early game especially when you are travelling long distances.  When you have quest npcs with you, you can't fast travel.  If they get unexpectedly stuck in a tree you have to travel all the way back to retreive them.  This can be frustrating. There are some quests that you receive early in the game that won't be completed until later.  Many have had problems with this.  I imagine it will be fixed in later versions given this game is only early access.  SOme quests are a little buggy but that is mostly due to the fact that npcs end up getting stuck in random places.  There was one quest involving two npcs and I couldn't complete the quest because one of the npcs randomly got stuck in a mountain side and I couldn't get him down until I dug out the mountain side.\n\nBuilding:\nThe game contains a lot of building which is great.  Kind of like minecraft.  You can make your own weapons and vehicles and whatnot.  You require schematics to build things and sometimes require to build one thing in order to build another.  It doesn't get overly complicated though.  The difficulty of the build is often representative of the usefulness of what you are building.  For instance, you can't just easily build a helicopter.  It requires you build a cockpick, rotors, engines, energy cells, etc.  It is a very intuitive building system that takes a little time to get use to but once you are it is very easy to use.  There is a lot of fun to be had.  A lot of creativity that can be used.  I will say the game could do better at helping you understand the proper needs of a vehicle.  I made a dune-buggy type car and I had all the pieces but in game I got this red text at the bottom that told me the car is overpowered or something.  It never really told me why it was overpowered or how to fix it.  The car still worked fine as it was.\n\nEnemies:\nThere are a lot of animals and enemies in the game.  Many of the animals are docile until you attack them which is nice.  Some of the animals are hostile from the start and it is fun and interesting to see which animals will attack on site and which animals will run right beside you.  The enemies are dangerous too.  Some prefer to sit back and snipe you.  Others will come slinging swords and whatnot.  Some will even mount turrets and will sling rockets and bullets at your face.  The animals and enemies come in all shapes and sizes and the size of the mob usually indicates how dangerous they are.  There are a few points where you fight some extremely large enemies and they can prove quite hard to defeat.  I will say the ranged mobs seem a lot more easy to conquer given they can be dodged easily.\n\nOverall:\nWonderful game with a ton of potential.  It already has a great deal built into and most of what will probably come from later versions is just more content.  I hope they fix some of the not-so-obvious bugs mentioned above (I am sure they will).  Creating your own camp and playing tower defense was really fun.  Being able to craft cars and helicopters and then drive them around was extremely fun.  The game does a great job easing you into the features and concepts of the game.  Very fun and leaves you wanting more (it is in alpha so that is to be expected).  I look forward to future updates and highly recommend you buying this game now if you enjoy rpg and open world sandbox games like terraria and minecraft.  There is a lot of replayability built into the game and right now about 20hrs worth of straight story line with some random quests thrown in.  It is a very balanced game.","March 20, 2014","true","29.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It takes a bit of time to warm up to it, but if you give it a chance, you'll find it a deeply satisfying blend of RPG, sandbox, base building, exploration, crafting, and open world survival. The AI NPC's are a fantastic addition, as well as the built-in object editor, where you can download patterns other people have created from within the game. You get to create your own avatar and customize gender, hair, eyes, skin, face, and clothing. That's a HUGE plus in my book.\n\nIf you're looking for an alternative to Minecraft with better character and creature models, better environmental graphics, more streamlined crafting and building, vehicles, NPC followers, objectives, quests, and more diverse and interesting types of weapons, this is it. Truly an amazing game, even this early in development. I can't wait to see where it goes next.\n\nMy friends and I have already had quite a bit of fun with this in multiplayer, although at this stage the features could use a bit of work. It would be nice to have a more fleshed out multiplayer story mode. But even as it stands, it's a ton of fun.\n\nDevs, if you read this, your idea of enhanced NPC interactions like marriage and procreation? Yes yes! Do it! Also, it appears difficult if not impossible to get NPC followers to heal themselves. Please fix that!

Basically on every mission there is at least one bug you need to figure out how to avoid and thats anoying.

However this is how every Early access game starts out.\nAs of right now I can say it -IS- worth the asking price, as the game is fun regardless however I do have a few personal contretemps regarding the game.\n\nThe biggest one being it's been far too long without an update/patch.   They have plenty of communication but most games I play with early access pump off a patch a month, at least.  But rather then randomly pointing out fails and wins, I'll make a list.  Just remember, this is MY personal opinion, an opinion someone else might share.\n\n\nPros\n\n-  Scenery is beautiful as is, though after a few patches, assuming it'll be even further improved, makes me excited to see just what amazing wonders this game can pull off.  Even the Random adventure mode is pretty nice on the eyes, day or night.\n\n-  Although limited, I DO like where they're going with the combat system.  A little clunky, yes. But it feels less like the other generic fps crafting survival games and instead takes a 3rd person approach which makes the game feel far different. making sure not to force you into a choice between this game and one just like it.  You can easily enjoy both to the same extent without feeling like you made a redundant purchase.\n\n- Being able to create and download blueprints for other vehicles and buildings.  I can't possibly praise this feature enough.   Not only can you duplicate something you spent hours making, but you can tweak a design others have already imagined.  To construct the masterpiece is even easier, only needing the basic materials it lists to make it.\n\n-  Terraforming.  What turned me off about most crafting/terraforming games is the blocky or jagged earth you're left with when you take a pickaxe to the dirt.  When something looks too reticules, it takes you away from the immersion and just makes you want to get the digging over with.  Not the case with this game.  Not only does everything seems smooth and manageable but you can find yourself digging into a chasm below, falling into a dark cave, water to your waste.  Lighting a torch you would stand in awe at the amazing/beautiful situation you've found yourself.\n\n-  My personal guilty pleasure.  I enjoy nothing more then making a defensive structure, armed to the ♥♥♥♥ with rocket turrets, jobbers.  Only to use a craftable item that lets you call out the most dangerous creatures to challenge your amazing armada.\n\nCONS\n\n-   The music in the game is dreadful.  I found myself disabling music in-game, tabbing out, opening YouTube, just to find my own adventure music to play in the background.   (this is obviously easy to counter with a quick patch)\n\n-   Turrets shoot at the ground, walls, friends, or whatever, trying to shoot an enemy that might be behind said obstacle.  Because Turrets have limited ammo, this is bad... very bad.\n\n-  Lacking plenty of sound effects.  this is to be expected though.  Since this is on the same topic, I have to mention that the voice acting in this game is dreadful. it honestly makes me roll my eyes out of their sockets when I actually try and grasp the storyline.\n\n-  Lacking a worthwhile tutorial.  They are working on one now but I already know they're going to mess it up.  No one likes to sit/play through a tutorial for 15 - 20 minutes.  people like to see what they can do on their own, with the option of learning should they be stuck or inquisitive.  Making a colony for your people as an example, is needlessly complicated .  Not so much setting up a colony, but rather utilizing it.\n\n-  Being stuck on an island small as my ♥♥♥♥ in adventure mode.  I just don't understand it.  I loaded multiple games to see if it was just an unlucky seed generation but no, I was doomed to be an island\n\n\n\nAgain, MY opinion.  Love it or hate it but let me know if you have anything to add because my perspective CAN be swayed.  From the bottom of my heart, I hope this game ends up being everything it was meant to be.","October 16, 2014","true","44.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There are still a few bugs, but from my experience (20 hours on record as of this writing) none have been game breaking. So the good and the bad:\n\nGood:\nGood sandbox with a story line\nDecent graphics and well textured "alien fauna and flora"\nPowerful item maker (although somewhat limited) allows for creation of your own weapons/vehicles\nVast amounts of resources that can be combined into other parts etc making for a rich and rewarding crafting system\nSeemingly active Dev team\n\nNeutral:\nOk voice acting, not the best but still not bad\nSometimes NPC's can be annoying or in your way other times very helpful\nlack of ability to make your own armor types (in creative mode)\nAdventure mode (the free roam survival) is somewhat lacking in depth\nBuild mode devoid of NPC's and animals\nStill in Alpha\n\nBad:\nCan be somewhat glitchy (rubberbanding NPCs, sometimes textures disappear from ground)\nAdventure/Build mode procedural generation distance appears to be fairly close so lots of stuff "popping" in including the landscape\n\nConclusion: Excellent for an alpha/early access with lots of features implemented and working well. Shows extreme amounts of promise/potential as long as devs keep working hard at it. Worth the $15 I dropped on it while it was on sale for sure, try the demo on the dev website and if crafting/sandbox/survival games are your thing this is DEFINITELY a game for you.","October 17, 2014","true","41.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

However, it is an entirely different game with a different focus and mood. It has an exstensive crafting system where YOU plan EVERY block to your liking, which is a real breath of fresh air and adds some creativity to the mix. Please note this game is early access, so it has flaws. A major flaw is the stiff combat. It is DEFINATELY a work in progress. However, it has the potential to turn in Monster Hunter combat, which if you haven't played is a game about hunting monsters(duh) with very fluid and energetic combat.

In order to better encompass the player in the game a more diverse array of sounds would be great.\n- AI is almost aweful, with all the NPC's in this game upgrading the AI is peramount to having a fluid game. Too often are NPC followers  stuck in a ditch or animals frozen with utter stupidity.\n- Camara, this has been updated recently however it seems to still be an issue with me while I am mining/tunneling.\n\nAbove all, PE is a well-rounded game that deserves more attention.

That being said planet explorers is completley playable, and enjoyable in its current state. The most appealing aspect is the sandbox gameplay, being able to mine resourses and dynamicly build almost anything you can imagine ( buildings, swords, guns, land and air vehicles. How well you build it will determine how well it works). the terrain deformation is incredibal, I always get a little giddy when digging a tunnel underground. the randomly generated worlds are beautifull, and almost every part of it can be gathered as resources. all in all it is an awsome game. yes a little buggy (early acess) but well worth playing.","March 20, 2014","true","9.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There is much much more in this game then you see in the pictures and videos above.\n\nLet me tell you about this game from start to finish of my entire experience. I only bought this game this morning so this should be short right? Its only been like 17 hours right?... Oh wait, I have around 17 hours play time!\n\nI logged out just a few moments ago for the first time... but I am getting way ahead of myself.\n\nI had been browsing Steam and other various places to buy games that sell games like Planet Explorers, as I have been testing out many of these early access type games. I have been working on many different things in many different games in order to find a game to suit my craving for the ultimate gaming experience.\n\nI decided to test out this game this weekend as I had a little extra money this weekend and it has been a game that I have been doing my home work on over the past few weeks.\n\nAfter getting into the game and checking out some of the basic things and getting addicted, my friend logs in and I talk to him about the game and he decides to get it.  Now logging out of the Story mode single player (awesome single player story line btw I Highly recommend playing through it, although I have not done the entire story line I have several hours into it and it is pretty neat) and starting up our own server hosted on my buddies computer. His brother gets online as well and buys the game as we tell him its awesome and the 3 of us romp around for several hours till one of them has to work. I have to day off so I get swept away into Planet Explorers and can't stop playing it... its now 3am and I have been online playing this game since around the time I bought it at like 11am... I have to work, but first I have to sleep. I can't wait to learn more about this awesome game and update this further, but already I am sure that this is an awesome game indeed!\n\n\n********************************************************NOTE TO DEVS************************************************\n\nIf any Devs happen to read this, here are some suggestions that would more then likely make this game one of the all time greatest games. Here are just a few things that I personally think if added (if possible) would blow this game further into awesomeness!\n\n\n**Main Update**\n\n- Add Space!!!! This is Planet Explorers, we should be able to explore other planets. Give us the ability to build vehicles that have the ability to get into orbit and then give us visability of other planets that we can fly too.\n\n**Inside Main Space Update**\n-Different Planets- mean diffrenet content, with what you already have now I am sure coming up with 5-10 differnt planet combinations would take a lot of work but would also be do able.... I think...!\n-Space Travel- I don't want to build some machine that puts me onto another planet, I want to be able to physically launch off of the current planet and go find another one.\n-Different Level Planets- Different types of monsters, elements, ratio of gravity, rarity of resources, hazard terrain, and much much much more. The possibilities are endless with how many different planets you could create!\n-Help with thought and design- You know you have an awesome game here, so lets give access to those who want to help. Let people help you by allowing us to design our own content! Give Devs and programmers what they need to make modifications that you can install to the main game. I mean you are still in Early Access right? What if you released a prebeta version that had the above and below modifications?\n\n\n**Quick Updates**\n\n(Bugs) -Combat is a little off scale and glitchy\n\n(Content)\n- Could you give us some more building materials? Or give us more creative ability? We can do a lot already, but the more we have access to the more ideas we will come up with. Not complaining about what we already have but here are a few ideas of what I would like to see.\nMore Engines\nJets\nSpace Rocket Materials\nRocket Materials (BIG ONES!)\nSolar Energy Capabilities (I mean we should have this I think if we have the ability to travel to other planets)\nSpace Travel\nVoxel Space (Make space FUN!)\nAliens! (The UFO currently in game is kinda cool but also kinda boring, could beef it up with little aliens that jump out of it or something haha who knows.)\nPlanes! We can build helicopters but no planes :( We have no jet engines.\nAstroids, we have a thermosphere so we don't have astroids slamming into our cities very often but... on other planets... who knows what might happen? Maybe have some with new minerals, or ores...?\nCrash Landings-Who knows who else is out there, or if they are even human! Obviously we are not alone as their are plenty of other alien creatures on this one single planet already.... Would be cool to have random things hit planets you are on.\nMultiple Planets\nAstroids in Space\nStars\nMoons\nPlanet Moons/Astroid Belts/Rings\nMore Ocean, well anything.... just more Ocean stuff. There isn't anything there atm.\n\n\nThere is so much this game could be yet so much that it already is.\n\nThank you devs if you read this, and hope to hear from you soon.\n********************************************************************************\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther then what I have already said this game is super awesome and everything I expected and then more times 100. If you are looking for endless fun pick up this game while it is in Early Access as $25 is absolutely work it in every way.\n\n-Lifemaul","March 21, 2014","true","64.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Multiplayer needs some help, but it has great potential.\nI love the fact that you can build your own stuff and use it, i however wish you could take those items before you build them and "try" them for free in a training ground area, something like what Arma did. another thing is that you can build your own stuff but there are so many restrictions to doing so.  for instance, why can't i have a heavy armoured vehicle with 12 wheels? <which would be a tank, "heavy armoured vehicle">  more so why can't i build a gun with more that 3 barrels or one with 2 grips... the creations system leaves alot to be desired.\nAll that aside, if you love to explore, killing, gathering, and create with only what you have gathered this is your game.\nMultiplayer requires less of that, more of getting to a minable, profitable, ore quickly without dying with the trader being 'at will' you can sell everything you mine and get all the good gear in no time at all.  the biggest thing i have an issue with on multiplayer is that player to player interactives.  ie.  i can't use ladders from other players, i load under someone's builing after being fast traveled there,  and so on...

The game is still in early Alpha but with the new update I can see that this developer is providing good updates. What makes the game fun is the ability to create, fight and explore in a procedurally created enviroment. I really like the ability of allowing players to create their own custom weapons, allowing lots of creativity. Some of the ISO's (files that save the design of the custom gun or vehicle) people have created are absurdly cool (recreated vehicles of famous movies). I haven't tried multiplayer but I can see how much fun that will be by allowing games such as free for all or capture the fort, or survival (agaist other players or a creature siege). A lot is still a work in progress however. I can tell the developers are working more on the game engine mechanics. Other things such as more character custimization, more eyecandy,  is for later updates. I will try to list some notable qualities currently in the recent build:\n\n- Has some buffers regarding Health and Stamina\n- Full open creation of guns and vehicles (cars, helicopters, and now includes making boats and a monorail)\n- Many recipes to create objects in game (materials to create items such as weapons, food, certain resources, etc)\n- You have to search your resources (esp ores). Don't expect to dig randomly to find ores. Use your scanner to locate ore deposits.\n- You can farm your own crops.\n- Fast travel is allowed (starting colony only at the moment though)\n- Very large maps (huge in my opinion) and you can also mark and label locations on map.\n- Animal AI is getting better (pack hunting and herding). It's like you are on Pandora (from Avatar) but you are poaching every living animal and you use their meat as currency (At the moment...it might change, I am speculating) to buy items and resources if you don't wish to create everything yourself.\n- You can have NPC followers and create your own base and assign them jobs. This is still a work in progress however, IDK how much progress  they made in version A.08\n\nRemember that this is an EARLY ACCESS GAME! Saves can be compromised when updating the game, glitches still exist, the are many areas left to finish. The game itself at its current build is very enjoyable though. So far it hasn't crashed on me yet or have encountered any glitches or game breaking bugs.","June 14, 2014","true","42.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Honestly, the whole colony thing isn't the best part. It's the exploration, challenges, and building. I haven't played multiplayer yet, though. The story isn't done yet, but what is in, is great. The only thing that sucks about it is waiting (Walking Dead Telltale game, anyone?) There are a couple bugs, but not game breaking, some useful in a non-cheaty way (Usually.)\nThe graphics of the character are interesting, not my favorite, but I could care less.\n\nBad stuff:\nCrashes once every 1-2 hour(s). Not the normal crash though, it freezes, and if you tab out you see a dialog box. The other one is an ingame message with an error. It usually saves often though, so you shouldn't lose much, if anything at all. The ingame error seems harmless, I just save and reload my game. If your game crashes in the launcher, try changing the drivers under options, I was using a nonexistent one for some reason.\n\n*EDIT: As of writing this, I have 20 hours played. 20 Hours in a story that doesn't appear to be even close to finished is great, and I can't wait for more.","June 20, 2014","true","32.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Very similar UI/ feel of an old MMO like "asherons call" but huge, singleplayer (multi fully does exist, I have not tried), with mining, crafting, hunting, and a great building system for vehicles and equipment. It even has a colony building and management system! Visually not bad at all, not amazing, but it is always improving and sometimes when the light catches trees or a vista correctly I still catch myself amazed by the world and its beauty. All of this is the foundation on a fun and interesting world, with decent missions and NPC writing, and a very imaginative and diverse ecosystem of wacky alien flora and fauna.","July 24, 2014","true","26.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The current state of the game allows you to partake in a very monotanous single player campaign which is dull and slow paced. The multiplayer mode lacks the creation elements that would make this game appealing. There is a lot of work to do in order for this game to be a decent title but from what I have seen and experienced it has potential to be a brilliant title. My advice is to save your money until a decent Beta or the finished game is available.","April 2, 2014","true","7.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Yes, yes. Currently. Early Access, but I've been watching this game for quite a while, and still all I can say is wow. Its ambitious; but on the right track,in the right order, at a good pace. Open world, great customizability (Literally, guns, vehicles, aircraft, all designed and created by YOU) It does have its rough patches, glitches, unrefined areas, but for early access, this is to be expected, But what\ns NOT expected is just how MUCH is in it's early access stage...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/asharwood/recommended/237870/","asharwood","ASHarwood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/asharwood/","235 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWith 20hrs under the belt I can safely say that this game is fantastic.  There is so much to do and so much life to the game.  I will break it down by features.\nGraphics:\nThe graphics are great.  There isn't as much control over what features pertaining to graphics are used but enough to make sure your system can run it properly.  At full quality it looks stunning.  Light permeating through tree leaves, a nice not-over-done bloom effect, AA, it all works great and runs smooth.  Very pleasing to the eyes.  The voxel engine handles very well and even with an older video card, the game handles it all very well and even displays very far into the distance (im using a nvidia 560ti).    The weather is handled very nice and looks good.  Night time is actual night time.  You can hardly see at pitch black and need a torch or light.\n\nCharacters:\nIt is great that they allow you to create your own custom character like sims or elderscrolls games.  The NPCs are active but not to the extent of say skyrim where they have jobs.  They sort of just stand around and walk here and there. You can talk to them and get a lot of story background which is great.  You can even enlist some of them to fight beside you and you can equip them with armor and weapons and whatnot.  The mercenaries have their own set of special skills too.  Some are great with swords and others with guns and so on.  Adds nicely to who you choose to follow you.  I like that the mercenaries reappear beside you when you get too far from them.\n\nStory:\nGreat story line.  Makes you want to learn more and more about what is going on.  This coming from a guy that usually is not interested in story.  I found myself wanting to know what happened.  That doesn't happen often at all.\n\nSound/music:\nThe sound was good.  The music adjusted appropriately depending on where you were and whether or not you were in the area of a hostile enemy. It was a little glitchy but I've read they are fixing that.  Sound effects fit weapons and whatnot.  It could use more attention to vehicles and sounds but overall still good.\n\nQuests:\nThe quests are your run of the mill quests.  They are good and add to the the story.  They don't always feel quite at all like a grind.  Some can be, but that is normal it seems.  Other quests are more detailed.  I will say there are some bad bugs with some of the quests that require a npc to follow you.  That npc is prone to get stuck at a tree or rock and unlike the mercs that you hire, the quest npcs don't reappear at your side if you move too far away.  I have found that if you have a quest npc with you, if you bring out a vehicle and get in it, the npc will rellocate to your vehicle which is an unintended fix.  This leads to problems early game especially when you are travelling long distances.  When you have quest npcs with you, you can't fast travel.  If they get unexpectedly stuck in a tree you have to travel all the way back to retreive them.  This can be frustrating. There are some quests that you receive early in the game that won't be completed until later.  Many have had problems with this.  I imagine it will be fixed in later versions given this game is only early access.  SOme quests are a little buggy but that is mostly due to the fact that npcs end up getting stuck in random places.  There was one quest involving two npcs and I couldn't complete the quest because one of the npcs randomly got stuck in a mountain side and I couldn't get him down until I dug out the mountain side.\n\nBuilding:\nThe game contains a lot of building which is great.  Kind of like minecraft.  You can make your own weapons and vehicles and whatnot.  You require schematics to build things and sometimes require to build one thing in order to build another.  It doesn't get overly complicated though.  The difficulty of the build is often representative of the usefulness of what you are building.  For instance, you can't just easily build a helicopter.  It requires you build a cockpick, rotors, engines, energy cells, etc.  It is a very intuitive building system that takes a little time to get use to but once you are it is very easy to use.  There is a lot of fun to be had.  A lot of creativity that can be used.  I will say the game could do better at helping you understand the proper needs of a vehicle.  I made a dune-buggy type car and I had all the pieces but in game I got this red text at the bottom that told me the car is overpowered or something.  It never really told me why it was overpowered or how to fix it.  The car still worked fine as it was.\n\nEnemies:\nThere are a lot of animals and enemies in the game.  Many of the animals are docile until you attack them which is nice.  Some of the animals are hostile from the start and it is fun and interesting to see which animals will attack on site and which animals will run right beside you.  The enemies are dangerous too.  Some prefer to sit back and snipe you.  Others will come slinging swords and whatnot.  Some will even mount turrets and will sling rockets and bullets at your face.  The animals and enemies come in all shapes and sizes and the size of the mob usually indicates how dangerous they are.  There are a few points where you fight some extremely large enemies and they can prove quite hard to defeat.  I will say the ranged mobs seem a lot more easy to conquer given they can be dodged easily.\n\nOverall:\nWonderful game with a ton of potential.  It already has a great deal built into and most of what will probably come from later versions is just more content.  I hope they fix some of the not-so-obvious bugs mentioned above (I am sure they will).  Creating your own camp and playing tower defense was really fun.  Being able to craft cars and helicopters and then drive them around was extremely fun.  The game does a great job easing you into the features and concepts of the game.  Very fun and leaves you wanting more (it is in alpha so that is to be expected).  I look forward to future updates and highly recommend you buying this game now if you enjoy rpg and open world sandbox games like terraria and minecraft.  There is a lot of replayability built into the game and right now about 20hrs worth of straight story line with some random quests thrown in.  It is a very balanced game.","March 20, 2014","true","29.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

This game combines house building, vehicle building, armor crafting, weapon crafting, and technology. As well as the normal monster huting and looting, though it is unlike you will find a weapon on a random creature.\n\nThis game does have its bugs as is seen when a creature some how manages to float up a tree without moving, but hey... its alpha. The combat is fun though a bit repeatitive on the actions, same swinging animation. But to be honest the game is very fun, and a different trend then the MMO that we are used to. The graphics may fall short but this does not mean that the sceen is any less beautiful. The landscape is vast and its quite daunting to consider how long it will take to explore all of it... and thats just for the main story line.\n\nNow I believe something I should touch base on is the crafting system. As I mentioned very indepth but a bit hard to understand first off. Items you need to make you first must get the recipe from mobs or NPC's. After that you then have to find the resources and craft the specific item which is normal enough. But when you look to create a vehicle you must make sure to have the specific items your going to use when crafting it in your editor.\n\nThe mining, herb picking, and diging is all very fluent and easy to get the hang of. I would highly recommend this game if you are looking for something to keep you interested while waiting for the next big mmo. I personally have not tried the multiplayer yet, but from what I understand it does work... and to be honest whats better then exploring a massive span of land with some friends.\n\nI look forward to the future updates this game offers, and I hope many of you enjoy this game as much as I do.","April 9, 2014","true","9.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Don't get me wrong, it's a great game and shows a ton of potential. Using Voxels beyond what Minecraft has done is AWESOME, and the graphics, gameplay, combat, feel natural.\n\nWith that said however, it needs a bit more polish, it's a tad glitchy, even if most of the game stoppers have been killed. There's the little bugs, the annoying, 'I was in a cave digging rock and poof! I'm outside!' or 'why is that ten ton beast on top of a tree 1/5 his size?' minor grammer bugs need work, dialog voices need better volume as you can't hear them... at all. More things need added, ect ect ect.\n\nAgain, whats there is great, what can be is better, but right now... wait to buy. This will be my official review (FOR NOW), it's a great concept, and great game play, but it needs a wee bit more time for some polish. If you can ignore the 'minor issues', however, buy this game right away.

This is my review as of version a0.87.\n\nEarlier more stable versions allowed me to play with no problems while runing into rare bugs in story mode. I was also able to play with friends in multiplayer mode with little issues though lack of content made it boring at the time.\n\nThis latest version seems to have implemented game-breaking story mod bugs as well as many performance decreasing issues that have been left unattended to. It seems Pathea takes a long time to release patches and fix issues. But the patches of content they release are amazing compared to other games, however spread very far apart making the patches not so great.\n\nI am currently NOT going to recommend the game at this time as Multiplayer can end up boring and Story Mode (Single Player) seems to have a fair share of issues and game-breaking bugs.","February 27, 2015","false","60.5"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

While still in Early Access this title performs very well on both fronts, and should not be dismissed for the bugs/flaws currently in-game.  The attempt at exploration Planet Explorers makes is impressive, and although the graphics may be a little dated, the scenery can be downright beautiful at times.  Even with a map as vast as the one in Planet Explorers moving forward is not always the best option, with vast cave networks easily discovered using you Handheld PC, you won't have to venture far to discover the unknown.  One flaw that currently is plaguing this title is the draw distance, and the rate at which the landscape appears, while easily written off as an Early Access issue, it is one that will need to be addressed before official release.\n\nCrafting in Planet Explorers can feel like the usual fanfare, resource tiers(wood, rock, copper, iron, etc), but the Creations Editor is where the crafting in this title moves beyond what I've encountered so far in my gaming experience. Yes, other games have had content creation, map editors, etc, but Planet Explorers brings it right to the forefront of its systems.  While the Creations Editor(a more accurate name would be Blueprint Editor) can seem daunting and unwieldy, spending time learning it's nuances will quickly show you just how robust this tool can be.  I have had a blast buidling new vehicles and testing them in Build Mode to see how well they perform, and the experience brings me back to my childhood playing with legos.\n\nWhile Planet Explorers is on the right path towards what, in my eyes, is the next evolution of the Crafting/Exploration genre, it is not without it's bugs. I previously mentioned the draw distance, which is an issue for immersion, but also for traversing the map in aircrafts, or other very fast moving vehicles. While travelling around the map you will have trees, animals, mountains, and more appear in front of you, often leading to emergency meneuvers.  With the robust Creation Editor, and Steam Workshop support this title has the potential to develop a large following, and create many memorable moments.  Other bugs do occur, and not all game elements are currently implemented, but I feel with our support this could be a title to throw up on the board with Minecraft, and if all the kinks are worked out it will surpass it in what it does.","June 27, 2014","true","111.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

(npcs I need to complete one quest involving a certain queen of certain crab monsters won't spawn, even after starting an all new game and playing through a second time)\nBut here lie the problems:\n-that's the only place TO have fun. either you play an easily bugged, massive open world adventure mode where you get to experience everything or you play the survival mode.\n-survival mode spawns you in a rather small piece of land with only one biome. In the center of the map is a town, revealing that you are a SECOND generation colonist, taking away all sense of "roughing it." All you can do is walk out into the wasteland and get a little iron or copper, but never enough to really build anything good or give a sense of progression. You'll probably end up making a stone hut 10 meters from the town, cowering from enemies you lack the resources to face. this is especially disheartening because it shows that the only way to get to the fun colonies and giant robots part of the game is to play the hours-long adventure mode.\n-there's a creative mode, but you get the same little patch of land with nothing to do but build with no challenge. pretty standard.\n-although building is cool, creatures can just knock it down, which means building a home is pretty pointless, because it won't protect you from anything anyway. (unless you want to build a mess of turrets that run out of bullets)\n-a large portion of the main quest involves walking in straight lines for miles at a time, sometimes just to look at something, then fast travel back. (which costs money)\n-followers constantly get stuck.\n-the game has little cutscenes where the camera will pan in to show you something of interest, but these scenes are unnecessarily long.\n\na few days of my life I'll never get back... out of ten.","July 21, 2015","false","26.5"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

As of this writing; there are a few technical issues, none of which are show stoppers (indeed I have only had one crash ever) and most of the bugs are cosmetic in nature.

I really do, I've had a ton of fun playing when we'd actually manage to get it to work.  Multiplayer needs to be fixed.  It's so frustrating having so many problems with joining or hosting a private game, even with all the correct ports opened.    It's been out for a year, I've had the game for about that long and I honestly haven't seen any improvements whatsoever. I get that it's an Early Access game, I can handle the lags and the bugs... most of them anyway, but the way multiplayer works right now has got to get a complete overhaul.  We shouldn't have to rent out a dedicated server or have some tech wiz come and try to figure out why we can't connect for us.  This limits the playerbase to those who can actually figure it out (or has the means to get help), and with a game as immersive as PE is, it would definitely be worth the change.  It sucks, I mean I was just on and there were only 7 or 8 people total ingame throughout all 8 pages of listed servers.  While I appreciate the updates, I really think that I won't be touching the game until multiplayer is fixed, if that ever even happens.\n\nThat being said, I'm totally willing to change my review to positive if something huge changes.

I'm outside!' or 'why is that ten ton beast on top of a tree 1/5 his size?' minor grammer bugs need work, dialog voices need better volume as you can't hear them... at all. More things need added, ect ect ect.\n\nAgain, whats there is great, what can be is better, but right now... wait to buy. This will be my official review (FOR NOW), it's a great concept, and great game play, but it needs a wee bit more time for some polish. If you can ignore the 'minor issues', however, buy this game right away. Otherwise, wait, trust me, add this to your wish list, in 6 to 8 months, buy it then, it'll be worth the wait.","March 25, 2014","true","45.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fredarmisen/recommended/237870/","fredarmisen","Tenk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fredarmisen/","595 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis is a wonderful game and fulfilled all my expectations.  I highly recommend it, because as much fun as I've had with it now, it's only going to get better as the game comes closer and closer to exiting early access.  There are still some bugs to work out, but I wouldn't say they're a major hindrance to enjoying Planet Explorers.\n\nI played several hours of the campaign and a bit of the exploration mode.  The mining, crafting, gathering and cooking systems are very solid.  The 3D resource scanner system takes a lot of the guess work out of things, which is very welcome, and the inventory system isn't oppressive with encumberance or backpack limitations.  Upgrading gear between schematics and resource quality was very rewarding and interesting - eventually taking huge chunks of a mountain out at a time felt really good after plinking away at it with a low tier copper pickaxe.\n\nThe combat has a lot of flexibility and is entirely gear dependent, and if you have the right minerals, you have the best gear.  The follower systems ensures very good balance for most situations.  Multiplayer was a blast, and buildin my own settement was very rewarding.  As was building my own vehicle from a blueprint starting with no template, only key parts.\n\nThe game's seeds are not impossibly large, and have a lot going on to the point where you'll never have to trudge for a long distance totally bored, unless you want to just to explore.  Very interesting wildlife designs and behaviors, lots of predator/prey ambient stuff going on that you can watch.  The giant antagonists are rightfully dangerous and intimidating, very challenging but not impossible to overcome with a solid team.\n\nI very much enjoy this game.  If I had to complain, I'd say that I wish there was more to the character customization, and some of the storyline quests have some annoying bugs, mostly relating to friendly AI behavior.  The game can be gorgeous in places, but only if you ignore some of the low res, constantly repeating ground textures.\n\nRegardless, I still highly recommend Planet Explorers.","July 22, 2014","true","24.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

There's a reason it's early access. It's improving, but don't expect a complete, polished game.\n\nOn the surface this just looks like yet another ripoff of Minecraft, although in this case with gorgeous graphics. It's not. It takes a whole different angle on building things, giving the player a lot of freedom to shape things exactly how they want—if they're willing to take the time to learn the still-rather-clunky UI. You can build a nice house, but you can also build your own sword, gun, vehicle and various other things. It takes the concept of crafting beyond a preset list of things and almost brings CAD into a game. Extremely unique, and while I can't promise everyone will like it, if anything in my review sounded interesting, it might be worth a try.","May 15, 2015","true","19.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's far from finished and has been in developement for a long time : the team is small. But they d'ont give up their game like so many and they push on, polishing it. I have more than a hundred hours of this game before the early access and it keeps getting better, slowly but surely.\n\nTrust me when I tell you that this game once finished will be great. For the moment there are lots of flaws, clunkyness and a few bugs. But they keep improving. This is one of those game where you should keep an eye on if you can't play alpha.\n\nMy favorite part of this game ? The item creation system. I almost feel like I'm in 3Dsmax.

Haven't played this game much, mostly because right of the bat it sucks hard.

Crafting system is very basic and the UI is easy to understand. Graphics are nothing to write home about but are okay and playable in my opinion. The custom content creator is VERY cool which you can make custom 3D vehicles and weapons after getting used to it for about 10 minutes. The content you made can be seen in-game right after you make it (after you purchase it and materials). Its also a voxel game which means the mining and everything is in 3D as opposed to minecraft where its all blocks. Combat can also be fun against certain mobs and large boss monsters. The vehicles and equipment can be fun to use like the jetpack + glider.\n\n\nWhy I don't recommend it:\nFirst of all the game has been in development for about 3 years now and I still feel like its VERY unfinnished. Most of my complaint is the multiplayer. The lobby is REALLY buggy and attempting to connect to friends can be a pain. Me and my friends played it for about 25 or so hours (steam says only 10 because it disables after you close the launcher) and we pretty much did all that you can do in the game and quickly got bored.\nBuilding structures is very lame and unrewarding as there is practically no actual use for them other than aesthetics (they also look terrible). It also feels very awkward to build and you don't get much choice in materials and objects to use.\n\nThe survival element is mostly just fighting off monsters. Which until you can afford to buy weapons, is almost impossible. You also have NO reason to craft items as you can BUY everything via in-game shop which after you just mine random ores and sell it you can buy anything you want fairly quickly, you get end-game content in under an hour if you wanted.\n\nI feel like the game is VERY lackluster in content and will only keep you entertained for 30 hours at most before you get bored of it. They say they will release the game sometime in 2014 and if they do at this state then that means this game is a ripoff. There was also plenty of bugs but because it is early access I won't have that as a reason for my unrecommendation.","June 20, 2014","false","10.1"," 18 of 37 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","18","37","0","1"

It's playable to a degree, but gets old very quickly. The game's UI needs some serious flow tweaks - right now, even with the tutorial system in place, the UI doesn't provide enough information to get a player going. Luckily, you can skip over most of the broken bits. Once you're on the 'planet', there's an handful of quests that you can do, but the flow quickly rears its ugly head and the 'game' is more a set of chores.\n\nPerhaps in 5 years time, the game will be closer to what the developer envisioned. As for now, however, it will sit in my game library until it gets beyond a POC.","October 6, 2015","false","0.5"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

At first, it just seems like a nice solo survival game, but then it morphs into a game where you're creating your own equipment voxel-by-voxel (you can use others' creations if you don't want to design it yourself), building a colony, and managing a group of survivors. In single player, there's a campaign that is well written and interesting. Just with what's in the game now I can highly recommend it. I've played 80 hours up to this point, and I can easily say it's one of my best Early Access experiences. Development speed is on the slow end of the spectrum, but steady. Each release is sizeable, which makes for an interesting replay. Also, the music is fantastic.

This game was released on steam in 2014 and the progess since (now August 2015) is woeful.

Planet Explorers is a joy to play and you can pretty much build anything you want. I've only played the single player portion of the game and I will be enjoying it for a long time yet to come. Eventually, I will get to multi player and check it out but for now single player is keeping me satisfied.  I highly recommend this game and I hope the devs continue to follow through with its development as I believe this game has massive potential.

Dodge and kite and you'll be fine.\nAlso watch the skies in the grassland areas, the flying predators will try to snack on you.\n\nColony Building:  Absolutely love this part of the game.  I'm a bit of a base building fanatic and setting up a self sustaining cabe is right up my alley.\n\nCreation System for designing your own....  well almost everything.  You can design weapons and vehicles from scratch here.  The interface isn't very intuitive and I can't make stuff look good at all, but lots of people upload the specs of some pretty incredible creations.\nWouldn't mind seeing some Dev-made already ingame premades for the vehicles though.\n1-2 of each basic type would do (motorbike, landrover, vertical-take-off-landing craft, boats, etc.)\n\nIt's still in Alpha, but I can see a huge amount of promise here.

Decided to reinstall recently and see how it is coming along,  but after recent patches the game has become frustrating to play for two reasons:\n\nKeybinds- Certain keys can no longer be changed, this is a big issue as I use EDSF instead of WSAD.  Unfortunately E is Interact and can't be changed.  Be aware you may not be able to change keybinds to what you want.\n\nHitching- I can run the game in Fantastic setting with 60-100 fps but every minute or two I get this half a second hitch where the screen sorta freezes.\n\nMy current suggestion is wait longer before getting this game.  If the dev team can correct the keybind and hitching issue I'd love to give the game a try again.  They have added a lot of really nice elements to the game, I just find it unplayable in the current state.","February 21","false","17.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

And if they are, I will definitely rewrite this review and recommend it.\n\nSo here's why I don't recommend this game at the moment; First, it's an alpha so there's going to be lag and bugs. I expected this and this isn't really a complaint about the game itself, and I'm positive most of it will be fixed but it still made my experience with it worse.\n\nThen there's the combat, the combat is terrible and consists of clicking left click and hoping you won't die. While you're slashing your sword you can actually not even move, so pretty much all strategy is taken away here. The hit detection is broken too, I took damage several times when whatever I was fighting clearly did not hit me. If this game got a combat system similar to the one in Monster Hunter, that would be amazing, though that's probably putting my hopes too high.\n\nThe mining isn't very fun either. In games like Minecraft, Terraria or Starbound, mining is awesome because it's very easy and when you see that diamond or whatever you get really excited. In this game, all you do is mine stone and hope you get something good. It's neither fun or exciting, and pretty awkward.\n\nI hope, and think this will be fixed by the time this game is released, and if it is I can see myself playing this a lot, but at the moment I don't feel like I can recommend this game.","December 22, 2014","false","2.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

This game has been in Alpha for a solid year and a half and probably will still be early access for another 2 or 3 years based on how slow the devs are working on this game. There are still bugs from day 1 that are in this game, and while it is fun to play for a short amount of time, you will get borded of this game in about a week. This game does have a lot of potential, and I feel if the devs truly buckeled down and finished this game there could be a lot to offer. However right now this is just a shell of a game. There are lots of bugs and this game will crash/freeze alot. I personally feel like this game was a cash grab and it shouldn't have been released until far later.

You can import your own textures and decals so that alone gives you nearly unlimited design possibilities.\n\nYou want to make an exact replica of a WW2 Tommy Gun complete with serial numbers etched into the gun, you can!

It needs more work in almost all areas, especially the user interface design.  That said, I love the ideas behind this game, and the concept makes a great sandbox game even in its current state.  I hope the devs finish this and turn it into a masterpiece.\n\nThe graphics are great, though I wish for better animations and more exciting combat.  Combat is similar to old school RuneScape point-and-click fare, except that you have to move the character with the WASD keys and stay close to the enemy.  You don't have to worry about much in combat other than your weapon and your health.  Animations are also really dry, allowing for very little to actually happen on the screen, outside of menus.  Dialogue is not animated at all, and on that note, dialogue is tiny, at the bottom of the screen, so it's hard to read.\n\nControls are decent.  WASD keys move, right-click-and-hold to move the camera with the mouse.  Unfortunately, you can't walk backward.  That's not a big deal, but it was slightly annoying during combat.  You can't move and hit at the same time, so it really didn't make much difference.  Most of the game is played with the mouse, utilizing draggable menu panels, but you can set hotkeys for weapons and tools.\n\nOverall, the voxel-based building is a lot of fun, so much fun that it kind of redeems the game's flaws.  Considering it is still in Early Access, I have hope for this game, but it has been in development for a long time, so I won't lie, I'm worried about its future.  That's why I bought a Steam copy.  I'm showing my support.  I wish the devs the best of luck with future improvements.\n\nIn honor of full disclosure, I worked for Pathea as an independent web developer for their website back in 2013.  My opinions may be biased in many ways.  I knew about and followed the progress of this game since they put it in a bundle back then.  Working with them allowed me even earlier access to the game, back in the beginning of 2014.  It has been about a year since then, and the game looks a lot more playable now.","February 19, 2015","true","0.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Yes the game is Early Access and it wont be released/completed for a while yet, but it's certainly worth supporting the developers and watching the game evolve.\n\nIn it's current state it is playable, though you'll encounter alot of bugs and such. One of the worst examples is the Adventure Mode randomly generated worlds. You choose 1 of 4 biomes to be your main biome to play in, the others you'll practically never see in game. Not only this but the original spawn point and camp is normally on it's own island surrounded by a large crevice on all sides (imagine Avatar's floating islands, except these are connected to the world vertically). Not too much of a problem, just build a make-shift bridge out of dirt or something. But it does cause alot of annoyance.\n\nStory Mode seem relatively good, though I have barely touched it as it is at this point a long tutorial which you can get the over all feel and mechanics of the game within an hour.\n\nAs for custom content, this is where the game shines. You can create a nice variety of items and weapons in game at this time. Here's a quick list of 'functional' things you can create; Swords, Shields, Firearms, Boats, Wheeled Vehicles (any type on land transport), Helicopters and Planes. Now when I say functional I mean things that you can use. You can also create in-animate objects, wether it be a flag or a wall decoration, the option is there.\n\nAs for the construction mechanic, it works well. Everything is built with blocks and easy to place with good camera controls, and your buildings don't look blocky at all they are smooth. Though the gathering of these resources is very tedious. Just scan for ores and mine them or just stand in one spot and hold LMB and keep mining. That's it. There is a scanner that can tell you the location of ores in the world within a short radius, but I rarely use it as the most needed ore can be found in stone alot of the time.\n\nCombat is again, tedious. Simpley hold LMB until it dies. That's it. Would be nice if there would be (in the future) a skill system making you more proficient in either melee or ranged, with usable skills so you have to be more active in combat. The problem you will have is in Adventure Mode, any level creature will spawn anywhere. You could spawn near an alien camp, which would mean aliens would always be close to you and until you have good enough loot you will keep dying.\n\nThing's I'd Like To See\nMore 'functional' items to create. An example: custom bed or lights.\nBetter combat with possibility of skills.\nMake mining less tedious (no idea how that'd be done though).\nMake world generation in Adventure mode contain all biomes.\nA variety of pre-built items for those who can't create things too well. Or at least blueprints for them (Just a simple car and plane etc)\n\nSummary\nSo a quick summary of positive (+) and negative (-) points of the game:\n\n+Custom content, create what you want.\n+Choice of 3 game modes (Story, Adventure and Build)\n+A good amount of crafting recipes, including armour and utilities such as a jet pack.\n+A very well thought out game which i#has so far been exectued really well.\n\n-Story mode (for me) drags on way to long as a long tutorial, didn't even finish it.\n-World generation in current build for Adventure Mode is messy. Also limited to one biome in adventure mode.\n-Tedious mining and combat.\n-Optimisation (expected to have problems as it is Alpha, not game breaking though)\n\nA solid 7/10.","August 16, 2014","true","19.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Many of them were spent playing when i had no internet, so steam didnt record them.\n\nThis game is, in a word, alright. While the speculated end result of this game is something very appealing, the game right now just isn't that. It has a clunky UI, weird movement mechanics, dumb AI, and lots of bugs. However, it has an interesting story, an awesome creation sharing system, and a truly destructible world, and an advanced vehicle creator, which make for a fun late game.

There is a new beta release about monthly.   It's also Early access, bugs are to be expected and then you give feedback.  I see so many early access reviews complaining about bugs.\n\nPretty awesome game and it's still in early access.  I also got Grav around the same time and both games are fun but each is different in big ways.  I had debated on which one to get for a while but in the end I got both thanks to my brother and his generosity.\n\nBoth game are beautiful with  bright and varied environments.  This will not be a review of Grav, I'll just briefly touch on some of the main differences.\n\nPlanet Explorers Story mode is the single player mode.  It has NPCs, missions and a story line.  I've only been playing Grav solo because the free weekend seems to have brought some griefers into the multiplayer servers and I wasn't about to deal with that, so I can't speak too much to the public multiplay, though I did set up a server for a friend and me to play.  Grav's single player is more just about exploration, but there are some tasks that you get some rewards for.\n\nThe story in Planet Explorers is pretty in depth so far.  You'll meet a lot of NPCs, with a lot of missions and rewards.  The biggest difference is with the crafting systems.  Planet Explorers is insanely cool when it comes to this.  In Grav you're working with about 10 resources that you'll need to craft pre-designed items, such as a jetpack or monocycle.  You'll have different workbenches for creating different items.  Planet Explorers has a lot more resources for creating things.  And then you'll create a few things to create bigger things, and then there is a custom editor built into the game for designing weapons, cars, planes, etc...There is no pre-made car, you have to build the wheels, cockpit, engine, fuel cell and then build it and export it into your world.  For example when I had to build a car for a mission, I needed wood and rubber for the wheels, steel, iron and motherboard for the enginer, and to make that motherboard I needed plastic and copper wiring.  This may sound tedious, but it isn't because you can click on a component in the crafting window and it will then open that component so you can click on the ingredients and make them and traverse the heirarchy that way.  It's VERY easy to quickly make components and see which components will create which parts.  You then go into the ISO editor (the name for a custom creation is ISO), which is like a modeler if you're familiar with 3D Modeling.  You'll place the 4 wheels, cockpit, engine, fuelcell and then build your car however you want.  If you google Planet Explorer ISOs you'll find websites devoted to models that you can download and play with.  There are turrets and lots of guns, it's amazing what people have done with this.\n\nGrav has been fun so far, it's a different game.. and Planet Explorers is amazing and fun too.\n\nTL;DR: Planet Explorers is amazing because you can create a lot of custom content very easily using many parts and resources.  The story mode is very indepth.","November 19, 2015","true","34.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

Graphically it is, but when you get down to it. The controls are so bad. I don't know why a traditional WASD control system couldn't be used. It makes combat agains basic monsters so difficult expect to die after any encoutner\n\nThe custom design feature is pretty cool with one exception, there in no comprehensible tutorial included in the game. You basically have to know how to use auto-cat programs already or find a youtuber that explains the process well enough.\n\nWhile Minecraft resource gathering is tideous, but in this game you literally have no way of knowing if you are gathering the right plant until seeing it for the 20th time and i hope you find it again. Wanna dig a giant hole in the ground? COOL! Just make sure you have a way out, because the caves in this game give you no hope for survival.\n\nIf you are trying to build a fort to protect from a monster onslaught good luck because those guys can pretty much fly. If a herd wants you dead, your chance of escape is like 20% tops.\n\nOverall this game tries to take a game like Minecraft and add elements of modern gaming, however it lacks in the simplicity that minecraft was able to hand out on a silver platter, and it was done with no instructions.","July 24, 2014","false","0.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I don't play often anymore since they hardly ever update the project.\nOverall its a fun game, probably one of the most important metrics for sure.\n\nHowever there are a plethora of bugs (game is in alpha after all so a certain number is expected), game performance has been terrible since release in the adventure mode for the game. Story mode while not complete gives you acceptable performance. Probably mainly due to the fact that its a static world and not randomly generated.\n\nMay want to avoid the games forums (the official ones, not the steam ones) though they are kinda dead, and the few people who are there won't take any critique of their precious game. (thats fanboys for ya, right?)\n\nOverall the game showed ALOT of promise when I bought it over a year ago. However since then development has slowed to a crawl (though they did release an update today I see) and it is starting to be outpaced both graphically and\ninnovation wise by newer EA titles like Empyrion: Galactic Survival, Ark: Survival Evolved (even though that one is more mmo) and several other EA survival titles.\n\nSo in my opinion, skip it for now till they finish intigrating unity 5, and hopefully start putting the pieces back together from the switch over to the new engine. Play one of the other survival games for now. I strongly recommend Empyrion if you want to be able to get off world and have a good quality first person mode.","October 16, 2015","false","75.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Excuse is port to unity5. It feels like they've gone completely backwards and are still porting what they had.\nI'm not a fan in general of early access, and this one hasn't helped. I tried the demo, thought there was enough there to buy, and feel like the second I handed over my money development stopped.\nNew things they are adding I'm not a fan of. The skill system already looks like something that is going to ruin this game (just like 7DaystoDie). I don't understand why every game wants to try to do everything and do it badly. It's not enough to have arbitrary tiers, lets slap arbitrary skill requirements on them, oh and make you research the stuff as well. That is the sure sign of "we've reached the point of we don't have anything left so let's turn it into a long boring grind so you don't realize what a lack of content there really is".\nSo many games right now with so much promise,especially of the "Futuristic Minecraft-type clone with better graphics" (which in and of itself is not a bad thing)  it would be nice to see 1 actually get finished.","October 16, 2015","false","5.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The game seems pretty cool. It doesn't run amazing and it's got lots of small bugs all over the place, but that's understandable. The game has lots of potential, but it's just not quite there yet, especially at the given price.\n\nLots of things are a little unclear on how to be done. This would be okay but when there's a story mode with a small built-in tutorial you'd think it would teach you a little more. But it has a cool charm to it. That's one of the reasons I didn't put it away to wait until it's fully released.\n\nI'd very much like to see this game get done, but it seems like it never will be. It's been in production for a long while, and even though many, many folks have purchased the early access it seems like things don't move so much quicker. That's important to releasing a good game. And the devs are always making small fixes and improvements, but it's been a long while since we've seen a big update.\n\nI WANT to recommend this game, but I can't yet. It has lots of potential, but in its current state I can't recommend yet.","August 23, 2015","false","1.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

There is a new beta release about monthly.   It's also Early access, bugs are to be expected and then you give feedback.  I see so many early access reviews complaining about bugs.\n\nPretty awesome game and it's still in early access.  I also got Grav around the same time and both games are fun but each is different in big ways.  I had debated on which one to get for a while but in the end I got both thanks to my brother and his generosity.\n\nBoth game are beautiful with  bright and varied environments.  This will not be a review of Grav, I'll just briefly touch on some of the main differences.\n\nPlanet Explorers Story mode is the single player mode.  It has NPCs, missions and a story line.  I've only been playing Grav solo because the free weekend seems to have brought some griefers into the multiplayer servers and I wasn't about to deal with that, so I can't speak too much to the public multiplay, though I did set up a server for a friend and me to play.  Grav's single player is more just about exploration, but there are some tasks that you get some rewards for.\n\nThe story in Planet Explorers is pretty in depth so far.  You'll meet a lot of NPCs, with a lot of missions and rewards.  The biggest difference is with the crafting systems.  Planet Explorers is insanely cool when it comes to this.  In Grav you're working with about 10 resources that you'll need to craft pre-designed items, such as a jetpack or monocycle.  You'll have different workbenches for creating different items.  Planet Explorers has a lot more resources for creating things.  And then you'll create a few things to create bigger things, and then there is a custom editor built into the game for designing weapons, cars, planes, etc...There is no pre-made car, you have to build the wheels, cockpit, engine, fuel cell and then build it and export it into your world.  For example when I had to build a car for a mission, I needed wood and rubber for the wheels, steel, iron and motherboard for the enginer, and to make that motherboard I needed plastic and copper wiring.  This may sound tedious, but it isn't because you can click on a component in the crafting window and it will then open that component so you can click on the ingredients and make them and traverse the heirarchy that way.  It's VERY easy to quickly make components and see which components will create which parts.  You then go into the ISO editor (the name for a custom creation is ISO), which is like a modeler if you're familiar with 3D Modeling.  You'll place the 4 wheels, cockpit, engine, fuelcell and then build your car however you want.  If you google Planet Explorer ISOs you'll find websites devoted to models that you can download and play with.  There are turrets and lots of guns, it's amazing what people have done with this.\n\nGrav has been fun so far, it's a different game.. and Planet Explorers is amazing and fun too.\n\nTL;DR: Planet Explorers is amazing because you can create a lot of custom content very easily using many parts and resources.  The story mode is very indepth.","November 19, 2015","true","34.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

The combat is excellent with many different types of weapons to use and a wide variety of animals and aliens to hunt and all of them give some type of resource upon killing them, usually meat or some item that can be sold to vendors for currency. The crafting system is excellent and has many armor pieces that can be crafted out of differnt level resources from wood to diamonds. The crafting system also allows you to design and build custom armor, weapons, and aircraft/vehicles/boats all with their own individual stats based on what material you used and how much of that material is in the design. You can also manage a colony and build many useful buildings in the colony such as replicator, training station, repair facilities and more. You can build a tram in the game world and then ride in that tram. There are many quests to do in the story mode. There is a good farming system once you have a colony set up.

For example the textures seem somewhat bland, the animations for the characters while correct for the movements involved are a bit offputting and somewhat unnatural, difficult camera controls and the currency for multiplayer is way to easy to obtain. However I suspect that these problems will fizz away, not unlike a can of soda after being poured into a glass.\n\nThis games gameplay is fantastic. Creating unique weapons and vehicles puts this a teir above any competition that does not feature said mechanics. The building is smooth and is easy to master. Combat could be better though, using swords has a bit of an mmo feel to it. The online multiplayer works great too. I love the environments and unique creatures featured in the game, even if some of them don't seem to match up from time to time. Overall, It's a ton of fun, and the concept of this game is what I hoped the next generation of sandbox survival builders to be like. However, I'd like to see improvements.","April 3, 2014","true","36.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

As fun as any survival game but without the repetitive zombie theme, instead you get a nice change with the sci-fi theme that brings crazy scenery, plants, bugs and even a somewhat scary enemy.  jEven at the early stage of alpha this game is currently in there is so much to do, once you figure out how to do something you will quickly be finding more and more to do and before you know it you have played for 6 hours.  You might think you would have gotten alot done in that time, well not likely the map in this game.....its enormous.  But for good reason, there is a creation system in the game that allows you to create; like actually "create" your own vehicles.  You get the basic guts and mechanical stuff, then you get to completely design the body, style, gun placement, how many wheels etc etc.\n\nThe creation doesnt just apply to vehicles and aircrafts but you also get the option to completely create your own sword, shield and gun designs.  Now you might think that leads to overpowered stupid looking junk that everyone will be using, wrong the creation system requires you to gather the materials you build with and it will take some trial and error before you really get what you want.  Its simple yet still very detailed when you want it to be, granted there is a short learning curve but those who would enjoy the game will have no problem with that.\n\nAfter watching some videos I recently came to realize there is a glider backpack and a grappling hook in the game that you can aquire somehow.  So far I have only played the story mode and that has taken quite a bit of time to learn and make a small amount of progress through.  So I have not had the thril of jumping off high mountain tops and gliding around this enormous map, or using the grappling hook to climb insane mountains.  I have only seen video of the aircrafts you can potentially design and I cannot wait to design my own.\n\nThe game is every bit worth the $24.99 price tag and to think its only in the alpha stages.  I cannot wait to see what else they add to this game, I unfortunately do not have the internet access to use the multiplayer feature but exploring this massive world with all the options they give you would be alot of fun with a friend or two.  I look forward to the future of this game and hopefully you will take the time to immerse yourself and enjoy the adventure that is available in Planet Explorers.","April 9, 2014","true","30.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Mining goes below ground with what limit I have yet to try to reach.  The crafting in the game is simple enough and can be done anywhere and you can make multiples at one time in the same time as one which takes alot of the repetativeness of crafting in other games out.  There are a few flaws that I don't like such as the chat popping up when someone talks in a Multiplayer game but if you just move the window out of your way instead of closing it everytime it won't do it anymore.\n\nThis review is short for the fact that the game is still in Alpha and I have only played 5 hours so far but this game is definately going in the right track.","June 20, 2014","true","19.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Sure, it has a lot of glitches and bugs but thats what you get for playing an alpha game. Every person that buys this game contributes to making this game a better game. One upsides would be that you have a great deal of freedom in how you tackle the game, especially the crafting/ISO portion gives way for really fun creations. On the down side, it's kinda slow going and a bit daunting sometimes. Plus combat is kinda wonky at times and your weapons don't get real good until much much much later in the game.

Anyway, the trailer is good, but this game is pretty rough. It's not worth the 25$, more like 10. I'd wait a lot longer as its a really new game. Not even the character customization is completed yet! The way to save a world needs to be turned into a user friendly menu. The build mode is annoying, I think that should be removed and put the building into normal gameplay, not a mode. The ISO maker, which allows you to create your own items is amazing. But the waypoint thing for the map is glitchy, it doesn't put the waypoint where your mouse is.

I will say Planet Explorers is a missleading name.  At a glance it would seem you just hop from planet to planet and explore them, but there is only one planet.  Of course you can have a different planet each play through but you can't jump from one planet to the next.  What I mean by this is in adventure mode you can generate the type of planet you will explore, A mix of desert, trees, water, grassland etc...\n\nYou can make your own weapons - riffles, pistols (lasser or bullets).  When I say make you can use a preset weapon to craft, or you can build your own and play with it in the game.  Never played a game with such a nifty option.  It's really awesome to spend an hour designing your weapon, then build it in your adventure/story game.\n\nYou can make your own transportation - (note only on the planet can not leave the atmosphere and go into outerspace).  Make a 16 wheeler, make a mortorcycle, a 3 wheeler a 4 wheeler,  a tank, a pickup truck, a helicopter, a fighter jet, a flying carpet (lol someone actually did this).  Tons of things to create to drive and fly around in.  Once again its what ever you decide to create.\n\nMy advice to the developers of this game.  Change your main screen shot advertising this game to reflect more of what this game is about.  A guy and gal in a dust storm in cartoonish fashion doesn't set this up for how great this game is.\nMaybe a screen shot with helicopters, Guns, mortorcycles, Jets.  "If you build it they will come".\n\nGreat job on what is in the game so far, and can't wait for the AI update.  I just wish you would advertise or hype this game better for what it really is.  It's misleading in a bad way as it doesn't represent the true cool and fun factor.","March 16, 2015","true","176.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

Just gonna go ahead and place that out there. Not perfect. But all I had to do was play the game for a couple of hours and I know this is gonna be a fantastic game. Here's my story.\n\nLoaded into the game, messed around for a bit, built a gun with some ammo and went hunting. In my adventure i was attacked by a large ogre like monster with a heavy machine gun. After the epic battle i stood over the corpse to collect my loot. expecting money? guns? materials? nope. a Pita Salad. I was sold and eagerly await the final product.","March 14, 2015","true","18.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Crafting, check, world modding, check, the ability to craft as many varied vehicles, weapons, tools etc, check!  The amount of hours ive played isnt showing up because i was unplugged for a month, i must have clocked in over 200hrs to date on this, and its still in alpha phase!!!  I've never regretted buying alpha, but with Planet Explorers, it already feels like a complete game, and just keeps getting better!  Kudos to the creators of PE! es, its an ambitious project, but so far its all been well implemented.  I highly recommend this game to fans of Minecraft/sandbox type games, and just buy the game already, build a VTOL, motorcycle etc, and tinker away!!","March 14, 2015","true","25.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's a scifi/fantasy minecraft type game. Beautiful open world landscape to run around and explore, but do it carefully. There are creatures prehistoric and otherwise which also share this planet. Harvest and craft your defenses for survival. Game is still in Alpha phase and as I play through the story line haven't had any bugs yet.  I recommend trying it out if this style of gaming is enjoyable to you.","March 30, 2014","true","38.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

For a small indie game, the ambition this team has is immense.  The sheer scope of what they are creating is really amazing.  What's more, they are actually delivering.\n\nPros:  Huge world which is fully changeable by digging, shaping and building.  Amazingly-detailed item builder so you can build your own custom swords, shields, even vehicles!  The designs can be exported to .iso files so they can be shared too!  I hope this shows up in the workshop on Steam.\n\nThe graphics and sound are nice and character animations are believable.  Gameplay is wide-open with a lot of different ways to enjoy the game.  Single player story mode, Co-Op and competitive multiplayer are all options.  Time will tell if they all pan out.\n\nThere is a character designer with lots of options.  Hopefully more will surface as the game comes closer to release.\n\nI think this game will be an amazing journey with lots of things to do.  I look forward to the finished product.\n\nCons:\n\nSome of these items are due to the game not being finished yet, so they are subject to change.  The voice acting is very amateurish.  Not a big issue overall but there it is.  Combat needs some serious polish.  I feel like I'm switing a weapon, but no feedback when I hit doesn't make it feel like I'm hitting anything or being hit.  There are virtually no combat sounds either.  Combat is probably going to be a decent part of this game, so some polish to make it more satisfying would be nice.\n","March 30, 2014","true","2.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It feels like a mix of G-Mod, MineCraft and Starbound. In this game you can design many things, including helicopters, guns and cars, by building them voxel by voxel, then use them in single or multiplayer, creative or survival. Since this game is in alpha, there are many bugs, but it is and definately will be worth $25","March 31, 2014","true","9.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Let your imagination run wild, build what ever you want and use it in combat or to increase your survivability, build ground or air vehicles, i hope soon even underwater vehicles ^^!
