The graphics are old and it's going to have the odd glitch and incompatibility now and then. Anyone without common sense should know that your 'Octa core processor with SLI'd GTX 770s' would have compatibility issues with a game from the 90s.\n\nAdditionally, you cannot expect a game that was made for the PS1 to be fancy. If a HD remake was produced, the original old-school gamers who played this game probably wouldn't have liked it. Why expect a game or a collection that's released onto Steam to be new and sparkly? Developers ARE allowed to release old games onto Steam.\n\nSo overall, I recommend this merely because I congratulate the developers for releasing this great PS1 game onto Steam. I've played all of the games in this collection enough in my childhood and away from Steam to know this deserves a recommendation even if Steam says I've only played for less than an hour.","February 9, 2015","true","0.2"," 47 of 49 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","47","49","0","3"

Here's my review for each one:\n\n1. Moto racer, the bonafide classic. not many tracks, but the game is wonderful, old-school, and arcadey. A definate must-have! 4:3 only, use the "black bars" mode.\n2. Just like its predecessor, this game is wonderful and fast and arcadey. Much more tracks this time around, but the game is a tad more realistic and not quite as arcadey as MR1. If you add custom widescreen resolutions lower than 1024x768, usually they appear in-game.\n3. Moto Racer 3 is a departure from the second one as there is a heavier focus on "arcade realism". The COD of the Moto Racer series, but this game is very enjoyable still and as always, has a wonderful sense of speed. 4:3 only.\n4. The classic from ios, this game was created with auto-acceleration in mind. Play this with a controller and don't be as heavy on the throttle! The shoulder buttons are best for acceleration as button A is hard-coded to be Boost. 4x3 only, just like the older versions. This game is fairly faithful to its predecessors and is a good time waster, but not quite as good as the originals.\n\nOverall, i'd say if you are a fan of the series, by all means get this title. It's cheaper than buying each one on GOG, and it's great fun for all ages!\nThe game had extreme bugs on release, but on my windows 8.1, amd fx 8350, and nvidia gtx 660, these games run fine and have few problems.","November 13, 2014","true","0.1"," 36 of 40 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","36","40","2","0"

There might be a way around it, like setting my display to 16-bit manually, but I can't be arsed right now. I might put effort into finding a workaround later though, because I recall this one being my favourite.\n\nMoto Racer 2 does launch, but there's no sound during races, no music or SFX. Plays well, but feels weird because of that.\n\nMoto Racer 3 works (huzzah!). Don't think I played this one back in the day (or not much); it seems less arcadey and fun than the previous two instalments, but that's just my impression after a single race.\n\nMoto Racer 15th anniversary is the most recent entry (you can tell it's modern because you accelerate with the right trigger, not the A button!) and it's utter garbage. Not only does it manage to be uglier than the other, way older entries, but more shamefully it plays poorly. Not the game I cared about anyway, but dang, morbid curiosity is the only reason to bother trying it at all -- and even then I couldn't finish a single lap in a cross race. The way it handles just feels entirely wrong, like someone's first Unity game on XBLIG.\n\nSo all in all, if I find a way to make sound work in 2 and for 1 to launch at all, maybe I'll spend some time with this, reminiscing. But I cannot recommend it in good faith.\n\n(Oh, and I spent more than 5 minutes with this -- but Steam only counts time spent in the launcher apparently)","October 3, 2014","false","0.1"," 77 of 109 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","77","109","3","7"

All parts of Moto Racer got controller support! Even the 3rd is playable with the XBOX360 Controller! You can change the controls in every part. From Moto Racer 1 - 3! Just check the configuration settings in the games (or launcher in the 3rd part).\n\n2. There was nowhere written, that this collection is a remake or a HD release, so complaining about that is totally unnecessary! With the right settings and a little engine modding the games look really good!\n\n3. There are no soundbugs at all. The people complaining about that, are just using some random codecpacks, so the game doesn't work right. I got a Realtek HD Onboard Soundcard and no sound problems at all. Everywhere is sound...even in the movies! Config your computers right, then you won't have that problems!\n\n4. The AI is too hard?....NOPE...you are just too weak! Easy AI is easy!\n\n5. The games work like a charm on Win7 x64! No problems, no crashes, no complains! They work even better, then they were on Win95/98/Me\n\nThe collection is perfect. If you liked Moto Racer back in the old days, you will feel really nostalgic playing this collection.  I had a smile on my face in every part of the collection. It was like being a child again. Really fun! I will spend more time playing this collection, since it is a really good revive of the good old Moto Racer games!

All the games loaded an run. I do agree with other reviews saying that they could have tried to make it more compatible. There are unplayable areas (mostly when you're playing a dirt race with many competitors on screen) and MASSIVE slowdowns... Could be better.\n\nNow the biggest reason for the Negative review: they f*** up Moto Racer 2! Why was the great, perfect soundtrack changed? WHY? I do believe I left Moto Racer's 2 CD more time in my Stereo then in the PC, just for how great the soundtrack is. Then I load the game with high expectations for a battery solo to start the video and I get a totally souless music in a new intro video, and then the menu screen hits and where is the beautiful Punk Rock music? This should be advertised as it is on GOG. I would not have spent not even the less then a dollar I did.

I suggest mostly playing 1 2 and 3. Leave the remake alone. Pretty sweet though.  10 Bucks is insane though. This should at least be worth 4.50. So yeah.

Notes on the fix will also be at the end). I only bought this game for nostalgia, and boy did it deliver! The graphics are not too hot, but that is because these games are old (Moto Racer 1 came out in 1997). I don't recommend this game to people looking for simulators, but if you like easy-to-load, fast-paced arcade bike racing games, then these are for you!\n\nTHIS IS JUST FOR MOTO RACER ONE      https://steamcommunity.com/app/324110/discussions/0/613938575207390002/?insideModal=1    There's the link to the fix. It's a super easy fix to do, but it was found in a version not on Steam version (Duh!), so the only problem that I found was in the middle of a championship race when it said "Illegal Version" and I couldn't accelerate. The single races and time trials have all worked. I don't think I will be able to unlock maps since I can't advance in the championship, but there is an "unlock all tracks" cheat online, so I did that.","February 27, 2015","true","0.6"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

The CD for the first game is probably still at my parent's house somewhere. And the games themselves are still reasonably fun, if not very dated.\n\nBut this collection is abysmal. It's honestly amazing how lazy this collection is.\n\nFirst, there's the launcher. The launcher is the laziest part of this collection. It was very obviously made with Windows forms (So I doubt we'll ever see a Mac or Linux port of this), and was made by someone who spent maybe 15 minutes on it. It's just a drop-down menu that lets you pick a game, and sometimes the language. They didn't even change the default icon for goodness' sake! In an hour, I could teach a programmer how to make a better launcher than this...\n\nBut let's talk about the games. But with the first Moto Racer, the launcher won't even launch the game! If you go into the installation directory and launche the game there, it will work. But besides the issues with launching the game, it has not been changed. It's just as good as I remember it, but it's controller support has not been updated for modern controllers. Running it with an Xbox 360 controller, the turns are way too fast. You can get used to it, though.\n\nMoto Racer 2 does not allow turning with anything other than a controller for me (Which has aforementioned sensitivity issues). This game is a marked improvment over the first though, even if it's not been changed since it was released.\n\nMoto Racer 3 is the first one so far to run without any issues! It's not as good as Moto Racer 1 or 2 though.\n\nMoto Racer: 15th Anniversary is...there's no way to put this lightly, the worst in the series. It's a port of a mobile game, and it shows: Poor production values; bland and uninspired graphics; and very, very bad AI. There's nothing really enjoyable here.\n\nIn all, this is a poor collection of great games. If you want to experience the Moto Racer games, just get them from GOG. If this collection ever gets updated to be less abysmal, I will update this review.","October 19, 2014","false","0.4"," 17 of 31 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","17","31","0","0"

Its and old and u cant expect much but the real copy from 1996 is better. That is complety inexcusable. we live in the modern world u can do so much better with the source code then that.\n\nEdit if you want a good moto racer games just go to gog.com. you can use international prepaid cards. i use a prepaid master card. don't buy this game at all","January 14, 2015","false","0.1"," 2 of 17 people (12%) found this review helpful","12","2","17","0","3"

Plug in a old computer or if you can manage to get a special copy of Roadrash great for you. The only bad thing is you have to win the race to win the money to buy your bikes. If you win your race some hot chicks greet you or the guy giving out the money will try to cheat you with play money in a cutscene its funny to watch.  (All game modes automatically unlocked) Roadrash is not your regular racing game you get weapons while you can kick players off their bikes.  Moto Racer no you cant but they still have special game modes but you have to unlock them. (No cutscenes included)","December 31, 2015","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
