It was set in 1986 in Vice City (Fictional name for Miami Beach, Florida, i guess it's not hard to tell). A game that is still one of the greatest games of this era, in 2003 everyone was crazy about it. You can judge if this is a masterpiece or not by just looking at it's popularity even nowadays, how many games that are 11 years old are still played today? Not many.\n\nThe atmosphere you find in this game is perfect, your ears are delighted with great tracks from: Michael Jackson (Never liked him, but he had some great tracks), Megadeth, Anthrax, Cutting Crew, The Whispers, The Outfield, Bryan Adams, Iron Maiden, Loverboy, Slayer, Judas Priest, even Frankie goes to Hollywood, and the list goes on more of course.\n\nThe graphics were absolutely amazing at the time of release. Gameplay was, and still is great, the mechanics are friendly. You ave a variety of weapons to choose from when it comes to slaughtering random people on the street, including hookers and old ladies.\nThe cars you find in this game, are mostly sport ones, you also can find scooters and motorbikes.\n\nYou play as Tommy Vercetti, a mafia member that just got out of the prison. You are involved in a deal that gone wrong and you need to find the people who 'backstabbed' you'.\n\nIn my opinion, this is the greatest GTA game released, shame that GTA V kinda destroyed the actual GTA feeling. I would love to see a GTA: Vice City remake.\n\nAs for the technical stuff about this game. It works on Windows 8.1 flawlessly, without any compatibility options set, or any patch or modification. It recognizes new resolutions (1440x900 user here).\n\nA perfect game that gave me hundreds hours of fun many years ago.","June 29, 2014","true","2.3"," 79 of 91 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","79","91","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/recommended/12110/","peterhollo","CorvusCorax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/","533 products in account","Vice City is probably the best GTA that has been made to date. Obviously, as a PC gamer, this opinion does not include GTA V as that one was never released by Rockstar on my favourite platform. I personally liked GTA IV a lot and the reviews on the latest installment were very promising - I just think Vice City was more captivating than the rest.\n\nVice City looks dated, yes. Please bear in mind that this is an eleven year old game and considering the capacity of our smart phones this game is accessible as an Android application as the game's engine can easily be handled by our phones' hardware. Its atmosphere, however, is still captivating even a decade after its release so playing such an "old" game on a widescreen monitor with next-gen hardware is no shame!\n\nYou play as Tommy Vercetti (voice by Ray Liotta) and you are in the '80s. You have cars, music and even film references from this era. Some scenes remind you of Miami Vice while others are clearly a nod to Pacino's character in Scarface. How cool is that?\n\nYou have dozens of missions available. Some continue the main story while other are just side missions. Each includes a cutscene with amazing voice acting so it is a crime to skip any of the available missions. Oh, you don't want to do any of these? No problem: Vice City allows the player to just cruise in the city, steal cars, crash these cars, harass citizens (with these cars, too). You can drive a cab and earn some money at your leisure. Or steal a police car and become the terminator of vigilantes.\n\nThere are tons of things to do in GTA. And while Vice City is certainly an outdated game nothing else out there can remind you how cool the '80s were than this piece of treasure.","March 20, 2014","true","40.2"," 58 of 64 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","58","64","0","0"

There are a lot of similarities between Vice City's story and the movie Scarface; I'll let you see for youself.\n\nUnlike Grand Theft Auto III, Vice City is wild, colorful and of course, BAD. The world truly captures the 80's feeling, not just with cars, people or the environment, but with music. The first song you are guaranteed to hear, is Michael Jackson's Billie Jean. Other notable songs include Killed the radio star.

Just kidding.\n\nHi, I'm Dubgame. You may remember me from such reviews as "Fallout: New Vegas", "Hotline Miami" and "Bad Rats". Now I have been playing Grand Theft Auto: Vice City for 12 years now and I cannot say that I am bored with it. This game is a proper classic! The storyline, the soundtrack, the memories, fantastic! For a game that was released in 2002 I personally think that it has aged well. If you have not played this game then there is something seriously wrong with you or you have been living in a cave since '02. This was made back when Rockstar cared about gameplay more than appearance. Once again friends, I thank you for taking the time from your busy schedules to read my review. I truly hope I have influenced your opinion of Grand Theft Auto: Vice City.\n\nYours in gaming,\nDubgame.","December 24, 2013","true","98.5"," 29 of 33 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","29","33","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ALoyalRoyal/recommended/12110/","ALoyalRoyal","ALoyalRoyal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ALoyalRoyal/","172 products in account","So you might be asking why review a game that originally came out in 2002/2003? Well to this day it is still my favorite game. Nothing has come close to beating it and i don’t think anything ever will.\n\nThere’s been a lot of controversy over the years about the Grand Theft Auto games, and their potential effects on children; so, this is probably a bad time to mention that I first played Vice City when I was quite young.\nBut onto why I love the game so much: it’s probably a mixture of nostalgia and obsession. I believe that it would be in my top 5 games that I’ve spent the most time on (I’ve probably beaten it 12 times), and it’s quite ultimately the game I am the most familiar with.\n\nOne of the more-objectively strong reasons why I love Vice City over the other GTA games is that Tommy Vercetti, as a main character, makes the most sense. It’s out of character for the majority of GTA characters to run around on a rampage. Vercetti is a sandpaper-rough, heartless shell of a man: he only wants to get the money back that was stolen from him, and he’ll work with whoever he can to achieve his goals. Some people may see him as a bit of a shallow character, but I’d rather that over a bad-guy-turned-good, like a lot of the other main characters in the GTA series. It just makes no sense for Niko (from GTA IV) to mow down dozens of pedestrians, when a lot of his dialogue is about the horrors of war back in his homeland, and how he is coming to the US to make himself a new life. Plus he first appears wearing a light blue-green Hawaiian shirt i mean what is there not to love.\n\nMuch like the cast of characters, the story of Vice City worked so wonderfully because the developers threw it all against the backdrop of the nineteen eighties, which was in itself just a rip roaring time to be alive. At least that’s the impression one gets from games and television. You know, if you ignored the cold war, economic recession and the bad hairstyles. Vice City won in my eyes as it was a straight up gangster story. It certainly helped that it was basically a retelling of Scarface. If you’re going to make an 80s gangster movie there’s no better source material.\n\nNow onto the most-subjective reason why I love the game, even more so than pure nostalgia: the radio stations, or more specifically: V Rock. I still have the entire audio file of the station on my computer, and I’d listen to it separate from the game. I listen to it while i’m driving around today so that must count for something.\n\nV Rock is still for me the pinnacle of in game music. As someone who wasn’t that into music in my younger days, I can thank V Rock for introducing me to the bands I would still be listening to today. 2 Minutes to Midnight by Iron Maiden, Bark at the Moon from Ozzy, ♥♥♥ On Feel The Noize by Quiet Riot, Twisted Sister, Motley Crue and many more. Classic metal at its finest. It was also hosted by everyone’s favourite radio host Lazlow, of Chatterbox fame.\n\nThis isn’t to say that Vice City is a perfect game, but then again I personally believe that a critical part of loving something is realising that it’s not perfect, and being okay with its faults. The game has some pretty obtrusive shooting controls, because of the early lock-on mechanic. It’s the same sort of issue that the other PS2-era GTAs had. This makes the shooting parts of gameplay quite unnecessarily hard. Not that I dislike a hard game, but I want to at least feel as though I am in control when I am getting the crap shot out of my character.\n\nTo summarise, Vice City is a great combination of atmosphere, story, characters, and soundtrack. If you’re only familiar with the Grand Theft Auto games with fancy graphics on current-gen consoles, then you really should give Vice City a try.\n\nYou can thank me later.","January 12","true","3.5"," 22 of 22 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","22","22","4","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/recommended/12110/","Harley365","Harley365","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/","213 products in account",""Welcome to Vice City, 1986. . . ."\nIntroduction\n\nGrand Theft Auto: Vice City. In a sense this is the game turned the franchise from a cult classic, to a game that everyone wanted. Since while in GTA, and GTA II, it was a top based shooter. There was no real story line, and general it was a cult game series. GTA III, it gave you a silent hero based in 2001. You suddenly were able to shoot in a 3-D environment, and had an actual story line. Well here in Vice City, they've take the formula that worked, and added more to it, so let's do it!\n\nStory 10/10\n\nThe idea is you're Thomas Vercetti, a man who has just done 15 years in jail for "the family", your sent down south to buy some cocaine and get it back north. Well the deal goes south, and now you owe the 'family' a load of money, and you need the cocaine. As you investigate what happened, and you get your revenge. You'll see how Tommy changes in Vice City, from a hired gun, to something more. What I like about this story line, is that it's believable. Based on what I've found of the era (mid-80's), and the character profile we get of Tommy. Since if someone were thrown into his situation, with his connections. What he becomes is plausible, pending him getting arrested or killed. As a note here to the writers, they could've gone with some very immature humour, but when it does go funny, its done with a sense of class almost.\n\nGraphics 9/10\n\nI know some people are going to be screaming at me over this, since I gave the graphics a 9 rating over a 10. This game is 12 years old, and yes its aged well. I've seen modem games with worse graphics, at a higher price.Each gun, each car, even key people look unique.\n\nHowever, the problem is there are gaps where you see 'blue', and sometimes the details that separate two cars is so small you need to be the developer to see it. The other problem is running though trees, half the time Tommy is hidden from you. Which means you can't see him, and you see a 'blue' outline around the leafs.\n\nSound & Music 11/10\n\nThis is not a joke people. I am giving this game a 11/10 for music and sound. Since this is audio perfection. One of the reasons why I bought this game was for the in game radio. Besides the fashion, the radio music & chatter help set the mood for the game. You get an idea of what it was like to be in the 1980's. Where the cold war wasn't over yet, or how rap music was brand new. This is where you're going to get the real bang for your gaming dollar. Since I admit it, there are times I just load up the game, slap on a station as I do something else on my PC.\n\nBesides the music, you can listen to how a gun fires and you've got a good idea of what's being fired at you. Maybe you can't tell the difference between two Semi-automatics. However, if someone close to you is firing a pistol, and the guy next to him is using a shot gun. You can tell the difference, and when you're outgunned, that kind of information is handy.\n\nGame play 8/10\n\nI've got a few complains about the actual game engine per say. Sometimes the game lags for a few seconds when swapping radio stations, or exiting a vehicle. Other times, you can't see a 'target' circle on someone you're simpering, and when you pop off the shot it works. Who can forget that when firing from a vehicle, how there is no targeting circle. Its all guess and check. With the exception of when you're being driven by someone else.\n\nNow the beautiful part of this engine is how you've got to account for something moving. Most games if you're moving, you aim, you fire, you hit. In This game, you need to account for the motion of yourself, or the target, and sometimes both. The controls that are used are used in almost every game so the learning curve is not a long one.\n\n9/10","June 6, 2015","true","1.4"," 47 of 67 people (70%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","70","47","67","6","1"

The game presents a wonderful story of Tommy Vercetti who framed by his friends goes to jail. Our adventure with main character starts after leaving the prison. The story resembles the movie "Scarface". There are many missions, outside the main thread we can perform many side tasks from playing with the guardian of law who must kills the villains , to the distribution of pizza or "ice cream".\n\nThe entire map of the game is a great matched and explore it and look for the secrets hidden on the map gives us many hours of unforgettable adventures. Compared to the previous section, in Vice City we have a choice of more cars and boats, as well as motorcycles and helicopters. For carrying out the missions we get money that we can buy new weapons and houses. In this game, there are plenty of weapons to choose from a baseball bat to a minigun.\nThe Radio Station has a lot of amazing music from 80’s. I have discovered many of greatest songs.\nThe system of save game is well considered. In every house, we can save the progress.\n\nI went Vice City 5 times. Never get bored. At the end of the main story I have always tears in the eyes.\n\n\nI recommend this game.\n11/10 from me.","December 16, 2014","true","32.1"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","88","23","26","5","0"

You play as Tommy Vercetti, a Mafia hitman released from prison who returns to Vice City and builds a criminal empire. The soundtrack fit perfectly for the era the game was set in and was just a great mix of music. While the graphics are considered outdated by today's standards, Vice City was and remains one of my favorites in the series for the nostalgia factor.\n\nOriginally released in 2002 on the PS2, and later in 2003 for Windows, it was considered to be the best selling video game of all time on the PS2. Grand Theft Auto: Vice City was my very first introduction into the GTA Series. Back in 2004 or 2005, I had just gotten the new PS3 with the emotion chip, so I was able to play most playstation 2 games. There was a lot of controversy around Vice City at the time for the graphic violence and hidden sex scenes and everyone was anticipating the release of San Andreas, so I picked it up to see what the fuss was about.

He even went to the army, to obtain government protection, knowledge and money, which always lacked. But even this did not help him to avoid bad influence: doing another "civil" job of his commander, he violated the Charter and in a moment was outside the gate of military garrison.\n\nThe prospect of washing the nights dishes in the restaurants did not suit him, so the route remained single — hires apprentices to local gangsters. But how can you take seriously these clowns? The first lives in the port hangar and drunken, and the second rat and a misogynist, and a third for hours talking about their genitals. The last straw was returned from prison lance caught shaped jerk: he immediately began does business behind Vick and communicate with corrupt police. Long endure such an environment was impossible — I had to take the command in his hands.In the brothel — in a helicopter\n\nVice city eighty-fourth is a reduced copy of Moscow of the early nineties, when the "white" business did not exist in principle, but the negotiations much to decide the fists and "trunks". Therefore, to build their own criminal Empire have literally brick by brick. Victor goes to the neighboring areas, captures the building and makes them his property, after having disposed of the former owners.\n\nAfter several hours of heavy activity, he becomes owner of several brothels and gangster dens and pairs of points on the sale of drugs, bringing considerable income. The process is no less amazing than the result — I feel like a young entrepreneur who works like a bee from morning till evening. And no matter what it does not built kindergartens and hospitals — market laws are the same for all undertakings.\n\nNo, crazy action when porting from one platform to another turned into an economic simulator. Just in Rockstar's once dared to change some well-established principles, and the most striking example — a system of unarmed combat. If earlier the clothes that were only stupid to thrash arms and legs, Vic is able to conduct suffocating grappling and lock techniques of the opponent (due to military training?). Traditionally, when the desire on fighting and shooting may be time to close my eyes and instead, steal a fancy convertible, going to the waterfront to admire the red-orange sunsets, ride a jet ski on the water channel or to look at the city from the helicopter.\n\nSo good games under the brand name Grand Theft Auto that are not forced to adhere to a strictly defined lines of conduct. Vice City stories respects tradition and relies heavily on the attention of the public familiar with the series. Terse and business Victor fits perfectly into the role of the godfather of the city, continuing the tradition of predecessors: he can work before losing momentum and in a big way to relax. Sorry, will shoot him in the Prime of life at the peak of fame. But the writers released him two years he will hold in his pleasure.\n\nThe programmers at Rockstar Leeds to make the most of outdated engine everything: the picture quality here is even higher than in the original Vice City for the PlayStation 2. Even the wheels of the machines of steel volume, explosions are more colorful, and the animation movements are smooth and natural. Local radio stations for any musical taste and still pleased with the work of competent DJs. The rest of Vice city is mostly quiet and calm, as befits the relaxed southern city. Only the sound of gunfire and sirens occasionally break this idyll. The next "Stories" turned out to be perfectly optimized for the features of the platform: helicopters obediently "float" in response to the command, shooting at enemies easier mode avtopritselivaniya, and to steer the car even just at high speed. If here and there an accident, mostly the fault of other road users. Some missions seem impenetrable and can only be after a dozen fruitless attempts, however, after mastering all the intricacies of the task management clicking like nuts. However, neither one of them is not like another — and have the crowd of bandits to the ground to lay, and seniors home to deliver. A true Paradise for the budding gangster. This is not a standalone project, and another story on the life of gangsters that fit into the events of the series. Not just a game but a real world in which you want to return again and again.","May 4","true","386.8"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","11","12","2","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/quitjob_playpoker/recommended/12110/","quitjob_playpoker","Makki","http://steamcommunity.com/id/quitjob_playpoker/","1045 products in account","My favorite game in the franchise. Instead of silent protagonist Claude, you are now playing as Tommy Vercetti, charismatic member of Italian Mafia, who gets out of prison after serving 15 years for multiple killings. Soon enough he gets involved in a drug deal gone wrong and determines to find out who was behind it while building his own criminal empire.\n\nSetting is moved from cold streets of Liberty City to more relaxed Vice City which is based on Miami. References to 80's culture are numerous - disco music, pastel suits, styled cars. The American crack epidemic, drug trafficking and organized crime that followed it are heavily represented in the game, which also draws inspiration from many movies and tv series such as Miami Vice, Scarface, Carlito's Way, Godfather and many others. I will mention some examples:\n\nRetired colonel from Central America and drug trafficker Juan Cortez - parody of Manuel Noriega, Panama dictator and major player in drug trafficking during 80's.\n\nDrug baron Ricardo Diaz may be influenced by Frank Lopez, character from Scarface who happens to be played by late Robert Loggia who did voice acting for Ray Machowski, corrupt police officer in GTA 3. Diaz's mansion is very similar to Montana's from the same movie. Betrayal and the same clothes also add to the full picture. Interesting thing is that he is voiced by Luis Guzmán who played Gonzalo Rodríguez Gacha, drug trafficker and one of the leaders of the notorious Medellín Cartel in Netflix original series Narcos. Diaz's physical resemblance and temper to him are rather substantial.\n\nKen Rosenberg's appearance and behaviour are nearly identical to David Kleinfeld, who was played by Sean Penn in Carlito's Way.\n\nLance Vance is voiced by Philip Michael Thomas who played Ricardo Tubbs in Miami Vice, which heavily influenced Vice City.\n\nTommy Vercetti was inspired by Tony Montana from Scarface. Memorable shootout scene was also incorporated.\nLast but not least there is Escobar International Airport, no need to say anything about that one.\n\nGame introduces bikes which are way more fun to drive than standard cars and will probably become your first choice in exploring the city. Later you get access to helicopters which are easy to control and are much better solution when you need a quick way to certain place, or you just want better view of the city. Those who prefer adventures on the sea are not forgotten, you can also drive boats.\nMajor gangs in VC are Cubans, Haitians, Vice City Bikers and members of Forelli Crime Family. All of side activites from GTA 3 are also present here. Newly introduced are assets purchases. They include strip club, taxi company, film studio, dance club, printing works, car showroom, ice cream factory and boatyard. Each of them has a number of missions attached, and once all of them are complete a given property will begin generating an ongoing income.\n\nThere is nine radio stations in the game - on seven of them you will listen great collection of licensed music, while talk shows that contain lots of satire are on remaining two. Big step was made compared to previous title in quantity of material - there is over 10 hours of it compared to 3.5h in GTA 3.\nVoice actors lineup and their performance is phenomenal; Ray Liotta, Tom Sizemore, Burt Reynolds, William Fichtner, Dennis Hopper and Danny Trejo are present among many others. One person that you certainly don't expect is porn actress Jenna Jameson, who gives voice to appropriately named character Candy Suxxx.\n\nLike its predecessor, Vice City was given a lot of GOTY awards and achieved huge commercial success, over 20 million sold copies speaks for itself. I really liked main character, and hope that Rockstar will bring him and Vice City setting back in the future.","May 19","true","30.3"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

Only problem i hate about this game is that you're surrounded by water and you can't swim. Vice City has the best protaganist in the GTA series because Tommy Vercetti is such a psychotic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and has the best outfit of all the protags. That 80's nostalgic feel is what really makes this game shine and is perfect for a GTA title with the environment and music. I'd say this is my favorite GTA game because of its tight controls and its perfect story of cloning scarface and setting of beautiful Miami with the best soundtrack of 80s music with classic hits like "99 Luftballons", "Out of Touch" and "Japanese Boy". I never wanted to turn my radio off once the entire game because the soundtrack is so good. VIDEO KILLED THE RADIO  STAR!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/daniel_faraday/recommended/12110/","daniel_faraday","Daniel Potter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/daniel_faraday/","845 products in account","GTA Vice City, a game created by Rockstar North (Edinburgh, Scotland), which was released a year after the release of GTA III, on October 2002 for the PS2, and later ported to PC in May 2003.\n\nThis time around, the game was based in Vice City, which resembles Miami.\n\nYou are playing as Tony, a member of the Forelli Family, which is based in Liberty City. The Don decided to expand it's borders, so they give you a huge ton of money and send you to Vice City to make a deal. Unfortunately, you get ambushed. All the money is lost and now you have to find a way to pay them back.\n\nGTA Vice City solved all the issues that the 3rd one had. They doubled the amount of vehicles[gta.wikia.com], songs in radio stations and weapons. They even added FLYABLE helicopters and a plane to the game.\n\nThe solves the issues with gangs being hostile towards you. For those that don't remember, 5 out of 7 gangs would be hostile towards you by the end of the game. It became really annoying considering that some gangs had shotguns which could blow up your car in 2 shots. Well, in Vice City, there would be only 1 gang that would be hostile to you.\n\nThey also added more game mechanics. Now you could damage cars with melee weapons, shoot the tires(the cops would even have spiked strips during chases), and now you are able to shoot through windows of a car, giving you the ability to kill the driver.\n\nThey added the ability to wear outfits. (some areas, like the police station can only be accessed with such uniform)\n\nThey added motorcycles.\n\nThey added assets and safehouses which can be bought. Assets would have a set of missions that if you complete, you would get profit from. Safehouses would allows you to save your game and store additional cars in the garage. GTA III had only 3 safehouses, which are unlocked as you progress through the story. Well in Vice City, you get 9.\n\nAs i said, they added a few helicopters, and a plane that was actually flyable this time.\n\nThe amount of weapons increased, usually each weapon tier would allow you to pick from 3 weapons. But the biggest change was the addition of melee weapons. Unlike GTA III, where you only had a baseball bat, in Vice City you get to play with katanas, chainsaws, screwdrivers, mechettes, gold clubs etc...\n\nThey added a map\n\nThey added the ability to crouch. Now most of the time i see some one playing older GTAs, most of them never use that mechanic. Well, let me clear things out for you. Most objects in GTA, even cars, are made that way, so that when the player crouches, it fully covers him. But when you are starting the firing animation, your character will rise a bit above his cover. So in a way, this is kind of like the Gears of War cover system.\nNow most people don't understand the importance of this mechanic. If you played GTA III, you probably know that there been like ~5 genuine shootouts in the game, the rest of the missions involved racing for the most part. Well, the crouching mechanic changed that, making at least 50% of game involving shootouts.\n\nAs always, the PC port suffers the same issues as in GTA III. Mouse problems and FPS locked to 30. Most glitches can be fixed with SilentPatch.\n\nDo i recommend it?\nWell, this is probably the only game that is set in the 80's period. The songs in the radio, the cars, the city itself, something makes it so special. This is definately a gem.\n\nOther than that, this is the 2nd game of the GTA III era, which are all connected. And chronologically, plot wise, they are set in this order:\n1986 - Vice City\n1992 - San Andreas\n2001 - GTA III","December 6, 2014","true","23.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

You can also feel the city's night life as the neon lights fill the streets on evenings and shine bright all night long!\nMy advice to those who lost all hope of going on a warm vacation, to those who wish to be where the sun shines in the middle of winter: play Vice City, and aaall your dreams will come true!","July 19, 2013","true","75.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","1"

Like GTA3, this game has replayability that the more modern GTAs just don't have. The main story is just long enough not to get boring and although there are a host of side missions they do not become overbearing or repetitive. The setting is the real star with the gorgeous weather efffect, interesting characters,  musical gems, and funny dialogue. o#only cons are the mapping of the keys to controller is imperfect, especially with regards to the gun fights and the buying of assets serve very little purpose especially if they completed late in the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/therealbl1nk/recommended/12110/","therealbl1nk","bl1nk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/therealbl1nk/","363 products in account","Tommy Vercetti, a loyal former member of the Forelli Family, has just been released in 1986, serving 15 years for killing 11 men in the Harwood District of Liberty City in early 1971, earning him the nickname The Harwood Butcher.[3] Tommy's old boss, Sonny Forelli, fears that Tommy's presence in Liberty City will heighten tensions between the other Liberty City families and bring unwanted attention to his organisation's criminal activities.[4]\n\nTo prevent this from happening, Sonny ostensibly promotes Tommy to a capo and sends him to Vice City under the guardianship of a crooked lawyer and Sonny's contact Ken Rosenberg to act as their buyer for a series of cocaine deals for Sonny, whose interest is to expand his family activities down the South and to overrun the Liberty drug market with the high-end cocaine from Vice City, hoping to create a monopoly on the Liberty City drug ring to establish the Forelli Crime Family on the top.[5]\n\nSoon, Tommy and his bodyguards are awaited at the Escobar International Airport by Ken, who gives them an info about the deal and takes them to the docks, where they are awaited by the Vance Crime Family, prominent drug kingpins of Vice City led by Victor Vance, who arrive in the chopper with Diaz. As they settle the deal, they are ambushed by several armed and masked men, who kill Victor and Tommy's bodyguards. Tommy narrowly escapes with Ken from the docks, and as a result, he ultimately loses both Forelli's money and the cocaine in the process. Ken drives to his office, while Tommy returns to his hotel.[6]\n\nWhen Tommy informs Sonny of the ambush, Sonny loses his temper and threatens Tommy with the consequences of attempting to cheat the Mafia. Tommy promises to retrieve the money and the cocaine and kill whoever was responsible for the ambush.[7] Towards this end, Tommy meets up again with Ken at his office, who leads Tommy to retired Colonel and mid-level drug dealer named Juan Garcia Cortez, who was Victor Vance's contact and who organised the deal between the Vances and the Forellis. Cortez expresses regret about Tommy's bad deal and promises that his own lines of inquiry are being made to find out who masterminded the ambush plot. Tommy also meets Cortez's daughter Mercedes, who becomes Tommy's confidante shortly thereafter.\n\nWhile Tommy waits for the outcome of Cortez's investigation, he meets cocky 21-year old British record producer Kent Paul, real estate mogul Avery Carrington, and a mysterious man, who introduces himself as Lance Vance, younger brother of Victor and the underboss of the now-defunct Vance Crime Family, who wants revenge for the death of his brother and also wants the Vance Crime Family back on the map.[8]\n\nAs time passes, Tommy befriends Cortez and begins to do regular work for him as an errand boy and hitman. On one such job, Tommy is called in with Lance to protect the deal of a drug baron named Ricardo Diaz during a deal with the Cubans, looking to buy some high-end cocaine. During the deal, Diaz is ambushed by a gang of Haitians, but Tommy is able to kill them and save the deal, as well as Diaz's life. Consequently, Diaz begins hiring Tommy for his own agenda. Tommy takes this work because it pays well, in spite of his distaste for Diaz. On another errand for Cortez, he plans to meet a French courier to retrieve missile chips stolen from the French government. The deal is ambushed by several French agents and Tommy later kills the courier, who fled the ambush with the chips, retrieving the items.\n\nTommy learns from Cortez that Cortez's own lieutenant, Gonzalez, was partially responsible for the ambush on Tommy's cocaine deal since he is the only person besides Cortez to know about the deal, and Cortez asks Tommy to kill Gonzalez as a favour, since he was a man who he did distrust and was working behind his back. Afterwards, Cortez voices his suspicion that Diaz might have been behind the ambush. Tommy initially continues the status quo to prepare for his attack, but his hand is forced when Lance attempts to take revenge by himself and fails, forcing Tommy to rush across the city and rescue him from the junkyard in which he is held. With the die cast, the two move quickly to raid Diaz's mansion and execute Diaz. With Diaz dead, and Colonel Cortez fleeing the country to escape the French, the established drug empires in Vice City quickly crumble and Tommy and Lance personally take over, becoming Vice City's drug kingpins.\n\nTommy becomes the head of his own organisation, the Vercetti Crime Family, distancing himself from the Forelli Family and Liberty City and more interested in personally controlling Vice City than being Forelli's puppet. But the more powerful and rich Tommy gets, the more Lance begins to exhibit paranoia and sociopathic behaviours, to the point that he begins to abuse his own bodyguards and constantly calls Tommy in states of hysteria, losing his mind over being just a powerless second-in-command as he was under his brother for the past 2 years. Tommy begins to suspect that Lance is up to something.\n\nTommy makes alliance with Umberto Robina's Cubans against Auntie Poulet's Haitians, even though he is at the same time hypnotised by Poulet's voodoo into helping the Haitians as well. However, Tommy and Poulet part ways Tommy and the Cubans sneak explosives into the Haitian drug factory disguised in Haitian gang cars and blow it up, effectively ending the conflict and putting the Haitians out of business, enabling the Cubans to take over Little Havana. Umberto then becomes Tommy's partner. He also becomes friends with Big Mitch Baker, a leader of the biker gang and a Vietnam veteran, with both the bikers and the Cubans becoming protectors of Vercetti family business.\n\nAs his drug business expands, Tommy buys assets in nearly bankrupt companies such as a car lot named Sunshine Autos, a cab depot Kaufmann Cabs, a popular night club called The Malibu, a local boathouse, a print shop, Print Works, an ice-cream company, and an adult film company, all of which he turns back into competitive businesses. He also becomes a personal bodyguard to glam metal band Love Fist, and pulls a major bank heist. He starts to control almost all the assets and ties of Vice City: Sunshine Autos as a chop shop, Kaufmann Cabs for money laundering, The Malibu Club for dispatching drugs, the ice-cream company for the production of drugs and the film company to control the underground movie scene.\n\nEventually, the Forelli family discovers that Tommy has gained control over entire Vice City and without having sent a single dime back to them. Sonny is enraged that Tommy has become independent and is hustling him, and sends collectors consisting of high-ranking Forelli members to force money out of Tommy's assets. Tommy disposes of them, but after they injure the elderly operator of his print shop of counterfeit money, he decides to cut Sonny and the Forelli family out of his business, severing his ties with the Forelli family.\n\nAn angered Sonny arrives in Vice City with a small army of mafiosi, intent on taking their tribute by force. Sonny and his henchmen soon arrive at the Vercetti Estate. Just as Tommy attempts to give them their tribute in counterfeit money, Sonny reveals he is the one who set Tommy up fifteen years before, sending him to kill the eleven men who were expecting him since he was feeling that Tommy would himself take over Sonny's business. Lance then exposes himself as a traitor, revealing Tommy's attempt to fool Sonny, and also admitting to informing Sonny about Tommy's activities in Vice City. Lance explains that he did it because Tommy started to disown him and didn't treat him equally, and wanted him dead so he could rebuild the Vance Crime Family and the fortune he had with his brother. An enraged Tommy starts a gunfight.\n\nIn the ensuing battle, Tommy first chases, ridicules, and finally kills Lance, then storms downstairs, where he faces off with Sonny,","August 27, 2015","true","84.0"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","10","15","0","0"

Turn your frame limiter ON! It fixes about 8/10 of the common bugs.\n\nGrand Theft Auto: Vice City\n\nVice City is a game from my younger years. I originally bought the game in a special edition set on a CD-disk. Along with a manual and a map of the Vice City. Though i never really got into the missions as a kid, i now decided to boot Vice City again and play the storyline on stream.\n\nI can say that Vice City has it's good and bad moments. Good moments as in the gameplay, the story and that pure feeling. Bad moments as in the sometimes poor performance, the bugs and the glitches.\n\nI was really caught into the story and have never inserted a single cheat. I spend more than 20+ hours on the game and managed to complete the game with all assets completed(which are side-missions) and had found 90/100 hidden packages. The hidden packages are rewarding and so are the missions. As you play you slowly become more powerful by the mission, yet you do quite some errands but fair is fair, most missions are uniqie, fun and challenging. Even though there is no difficulty,  I managed to struggle with the game for quite some times.\n\nThe most annoying thing i experienced was the fact that people and vehicles literally vanish or appear out of thin air if you turn around. Scary it was not, annoying it was. Park your car, walk into an alley... come back and 'poof' your car is gone.\n\nYet Rockstar is Rockstar and Rockstar wouldn't be Rockstar if they weren't adding easter eggs and those little secrets, mysteries and theories which just make me melt. During my game i have found quite some easter eggs. Not gonna share or spoil but trust me when i say that they are worth a chuckle and smile.\n\nI have played the game without cheats or spoilers and managed to get and take the most out of the game.\n\nI can happily recommend the game. It's one of the 'better' Grand Theft Auto games out there and is with that said quite a jewel. Just make sure you have your frame limiter turned on. It literally affects everything. Handling, the speed of vehicles (especially ships ) and much more.\n\nOh and the music is gold. It will help you get that feeling i mentioned earlier!","January 22","true","24.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Saswadex/recommended/12110/","Saswadex","Airhorn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Saswadex/","24 products in account","Tommy Vercetti, a loyal former member of the Forelli Family, has just been released in 1986, serving 15 years for killing 11 men in the Harwood District of Liberty City in early 1971, earning him the nickname The Harwood Butcher.[3] Tommy's old boss, Sonny Forelli, fears that Tommy's presence in Liberty City will heighten tensions between the other Liberty City families and bring unwanted attention to his organisation's criminal activities.[4]\n\nTo prevent this from happening, Sonny ostensibly promotes Tommy to a capo and sends him to Vice City under the guardianship of a crooked lawyer and Sonny's contact Ken Rosenberg to act as their buyer for a series of cocaine deals for Sonny, whose interest is to expand his family activities down the South and to overrun the Liberty drug market with the high-end cocaine from Vice City, hoping to create a monopoly on the Liberty City drug ring to establish the Forelli Crime Family on the top.[5]\n\nSoon, Tommy and his bodyguards are awaited at the Escobar International Airport by Ken, who gives them an info about the deal and takes them to the docks, where they are awaited by the Vance Crime Family, prominent drug kingpins of Vice City led by Victor Vance, who arrive in the chopper with Diaz. As they settle the deal, they are ambushed by several armed and masked men, who kill Victor and Tommy's bodyguards. Tommy narrowly escapes with Ken from the docks, and as a result, he ultimately loses both Forelli's money and the cocaine in the process. Ken drives to his office, while Tommy returns to his hotel.[6]\n\nWhen Tommy informs Sonny of the ambush, Sonny loses his temper and threatens Tommy with the consequences of attempting to cheat the Mafia. Tommy promises to retrieve the money and the cocaine and kill whoever was responsible for the ambush.[7] Towards this end, Tommy meets up again with Ken at his office, who leads Tommy to retired Colonel and mid-level drug dealer named Juan Garcia Cortez, who was Victor Vance's contact and who organised the deal between the Vances and the Forellis. Cortez expresses regret about Tommy's bad deal and promises that his own lines of inquiry are being made to find out who masterminded the ambush plot. Tommy also meets Cortez's daughter Mercedes, who becomes Tommy's confidante shortly thereafter.\n\nWhile Tommy waits for the outcome of Cortez's investigation, he meets cocky 21-year old British record producer Kent Paul, real estate mogul Avery Carrington, and a mysterious man, who introduces himself as Lance Vance, younger brother of Victor and the underboss of the now-defunct Vance Crime Family, who wants revenge for the death of his brother and also wants the Vance Crime Family back on the map.[8]\n\nAs time passes, Tommy befriends Cortez and begins to do regular work for him as an errand boy and hitman. On one such job, Tommy is called in with Lance to protect the deal of a drug baron named Ricardo Diaz during a deal with the Cubans, looking to buy some high-end cocaine. During the deal, Diaz is ambushed by a gang of Haitians, but Tommy is able to kill them and save the deal, as well as Diaz's life. Consequently, Diaz begins hiring Tommy for his own agenda. Tommy takes this work because it pays well, in spite of his distaste for Diaz. On another errand for Cortez, he plans to meet a French courier to retrieve missile chips stolen from the French government. The deal is ambushed by several French agents and Tommy later kills the courier, who fled the ambush with the chips, retrieving the items.\n\nTommy learns from Cortez that Cortez's own lieutenant, Gonzalez, was partially responsible for the ambush on Tommy's cocaine deal since he is the only person besides Cortez to know about the deal, and Cortez asks Tommy to kill Gonzalez as a favour, since he was a man who he did distrust and was working behind his back. Afterwards, Cortez voices his suspicion that Diaz might have been behind the ambush. Tommy initially continues the status quo to prepare for his attack, but his hand is forced when Lance attempts to take revenge by himself and fails, forcing Tommy to rush across the city and rescue him from the junkyard in which he is held. With the die cast, the two move quickly to raid Diaz's mansion and execute Diaz. With Diaz dead, and Colonel Cortez fleeing the country to escape the French, the established drug empires in Vice City quickly crumble and Tommy and Lance personally take over, becoming Vice City's drug kingpins.\n\nTommy becomes the head of his own organisation, the Vercetti Crime Family, distancing himself from the Forelli Family and Liberty City and more interested in personally controlling Vice City than being Forelli's puppet. But the more powerful and rich Tommy gets, the more Lance begins to exhibit paranoia and sociopathic behaviours, to the point that he begins to abuse his own bodyguards and constantly calls Tommy in states of hysteria, losing his mind over being just a powerless second-in-command as he was under his brother for the past 2 years. Tommy begins to suspect that Lance is up to something.\n\nTommy makes alliance with Umberto Robina's Cubans against Auntie Poulet's Haitians, even though he is at the same time hypnotised by Poulet's voodoo into helping the Haitians as well. However, Tommy and Poulet part ways Tommy and the Cubans sneak explosives into the Haitian drug factory disguised in Haitian gang cars and blow it up, effectively ending the conflict and putting the Haitians out of business, enabling the Cubans to take over Little Havana. Umberto then becomes Tommy's partner. He also becomes friends with Big Mitch Baker, a leader of the biker gang and a Vietnam veteran, with both the bikers and the Cubans becoming protectors of Vercetti family business.\n\nAs his drug business expands, Tommy buys assets in nearly bankrupt companies such as a car lot named Sunshine Autos, a cab depot Kaufmann Cabs, a popular night club called The Malibu, a local boathouse, a print shop, Print Works, an ice-cream company, and an adult film company, all of which he turns back into competitive businesses. He also becomes a personal bodyguard to glam metal band Love Fist, and pulls a major bank heist. He starts to control almost all the assets and ties of Vice City: Sunshine Autos as a chop shop, Kaufmann Cabs for money laundering, The Malibu Club for dispatching drugs, the ice-cream company for the production of drugs and the film company to control the underground movie scene.\n\nEventually, the Forelli family discovers that Tommy has gained control over entire Vice City and without having sent a single dime back to them. Sonny is enraged that Tommy has become independent and is hustling him, and sends collectors consisting of high-ranking Forelli members to force money out of Tommy's assets. Tommy disposes of them, but after they injure the elderly operator of his print shop of counterfeit money, he decides to cut Sonny and the Forelli family out of his business, severing his ties with the Forelli family.\n\nAn angered Sonny arrives in Vice City with a small army of mafiosi, intent on taking their tribute by force. Sonny and his henchmen soon arrive at the Vercetti Estate. Just as Tommy attempts to give them their tribute in counterfeit money, Sonny reveals he is the one who set Tommy up fifteen years before, sending him to kill the eleven men who were expecting him since he was feeling that Tommy would himself take over Sonny's business. Lance then exposes himself as a traitor, revealing Tommy's attempt to fool Sonny, and also admitting to informing Sonny about Tommy's activities in Vice City. Lance explains that he did it because Tommy started to disown him and didn't treat him equally, and wanted him dead so he could rebuild the Vance Crime Family and the fortune he had with his brother. An enraged Tommy starts a gunfight.\n\nIn the ensuing battle, Tommy first chases, ridicules, and finally kills Lance, then storms downstairs, where he faces off with Sonny,","May 30, 2015","true","20.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Other than that, it performs horribly on a modern PC. You can say I have high standards, but the outdated settings and bugs make the game unplayable. The mouse sensitivity is extremely high, to the point that turning it all the way down doesn't help, it's maximum resolution is about a quarter of any screen made after 2006, and overall the controls are awkward and irritating. I'm sure there are mods out there to update the feel of the game, but for a user who wants it to be working right out of the box, they'll find themselves largely disappointed.","May 17","true","0.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Everybody will enjoy from taking a sports car, switching to Flash FM, driving around city when listening Billie Jeans from Michael Jackson or spawning a tank and being a destroyer or buying M-60 with lots of ammo and being a badass etc...

I couldn't complete it.\n\nSo I found GTA VC on GMG for £1.20 and the 15 yo self demanded it to be played and completed. It was hard to not look at it from a 2014 perspective, because I was playing sleeping dogs at the same which is far superior in every way.\n\nFirst of all, use cheats, otherwise you will run out of money buying armour and weapons all the time.\nAlso, as it is an old game, there is no load option in the pause menu. You have to drive to your home to save or load a game, which can get frustrating every time you die or get arrested and want to save money by not spending it again on weapons and armour.\n\nThe graphics are average, it is an old game so we will let that pass. The physics, however, are absolutely horrible, you fall immediately off a motorcycle from the slightest of touches; using planes and helicopters are a drag, and some cars are just impossible to drive with.\n\nOK, the game. Tommy Vercetti is your lead character, and he's come to Vice City to take it over. You do missions for various gangs, businesses, and mafia type bosses.\n\nOne tip, after a while you'll notice you don't have any missions to do, even though the story is clearly not finish. You have to buy the printworks, and 5 other businesses (Not Homes!) and complete the missions for all of them. To know if you completed the missions, the businesses will generate money for you which you can collect often. DO NOT BUY THE PORN STUDIOS! The missions for that one are absolutely dire and no fun at all. Best ones are the Kauffman cab, and I heard the Malibu club is pretty good too.\nAfter a while you're old mafia boss comes after you and you have to kill. It's pretty basic mafia story that is clearly inspired by scarface. It's a good story and you do enjoy watching the cut scenes due to the array characters involved.\n\nGTA VC is still for me the best GTA game. The size of the  map was perfect and the story was pretty decent1The radio shows are also perfect, playing the best music that represents the 80s feel of the game.  Small things like physics of vehicals and graphics are a negative, but they won't be too much of a hassle. I recommend playing with a mouse just so you can shoot better. If you want to use a controller, I suggest you look online to find forums that help you with that as this GTA VC doesn't support controllers very well.\n\nOverall, I'll give this a 7/10","July 1, 2014","true","22.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The map is decent in size and I still seem to find something fun to do everytime I put the game on. The story is OK, but most people only play this game to mess around in the sandbox (like me). You can buy properties after you finish the career, and some of them can generate money. There's a pretty good variety of vehicles, and the taxis, firetrucks, ambulances, and police cars all have their own missions, as well as a few of the other properties you buy (like the Ice Cream shop). There are also cool minigames scattered around the map, like racing an R/C car in  the sand. I wish that there would be more planes for you to use, since the only one you get is at the top of the endgame mansion.

Tommy Vercetti has lost a lot of money, and needs to get them back. He is starting to work for people in Vice City, so he can pay Sonny Forelli back.\n\nOne of the things I was most happy for in Vice City was the music. So if you like the 80 and 90s music, you will like most of the music in Vice City.\n\nThe PC version includes a lot of new features, here are some of them:\nCustom Resolutions 	 (Choose your own Resolution)\nBetter Graphics 	 (There is better Graphics and also custom Draw Distance)\nCustom Radio Station 	 (Upload your own mp3 and make your own Radio Station)\nFrame Limiter 	 (By disabling Frame Limiter, you can play Vice City in 60fps)\n\nThere is of course a lot of other new features, this is just some of them.\n\nVice City is of course recommended, and is a game you must play!\n","December 3, 2015","true","52.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Objectively, it's better than GTA3 in most ways, but it's not the original, nor does it reach the heights of the third game - this is likely amplified because I came to this game after having played the other two. That being said, this game is an absolute joy to play, and anyone who has nostalgia for the 80s will LOVE the music.\n\nSo, just like the other two, a must-have for any person looking to build the collection.

It could've been a DLC for GTA 3, but content-wise it's a full game of its own. It puts you in a world oozing of 80s pop culture, and you would have to be crazy not to love that. The game has some small improvements over GTA 3, and features some new stuff that vary from good to less good. It's easy to see that things started leaning toward a less arcade-like experience than GTA 3, which continued later in the series. For instance, the protagonist now has a voice and personality. The series gains some new grounds with Vice City, but it's pretty much on-par with GTA 3. It's not as revolutionary as GTA 3, but it's definitely a good game, and shows the direction the franchise later took.

Bright colours, fast cars, nonsensical missions, funny characters, and great controls made sure that this game is still regarded by many as their favourite in the franchise.\n\nLong version:Grand Theft Auto: Vice City is a strange one, even for GTA. The whole game is more or less an 18-hour parody of Miami Vice– a half-forgotten, enjoyably dumb action show of the 80s. Everything is colourful and neon bright, and practically every story mission, every character, every random dialogue is a parody of something (just listen to the two talk show radios; they are full of the weirdest things).\n\nWhat makes it a masterpiece is that none of these are over the top. The storyline may be silly at some points, but the core of it is deadly serious: you play as a gangster who was sent to Vice City (Miami) to create a foothold for the Mafia drug business. The deal goes belly-up, but by the end of the game you somehow become the de facto crime lord of the city, either by buying or killing any opposition.\n\nThe missions that lead to this goal have great variety and design; almost none feel the same and everyone can find their favourites among them. To complete them, you have access to a wider variety of weapons and vehicles, which now include aircraft and motorcycles. Travelling around is quite easy and fun now.\nMany old-school game elements like bomb shops and the top-down camera were removed, but they are rarely missed with such improvements as purchasable assets, which all can be turned into a money-making machine after you complete their associated tasks. Although you still cannot spend that money on anything but more assets and weapons.\n\nThese smaller and larger touches not only made Vice City a great game, but also probably the most characteristic and memorable one in the GTA franchise, earning it a permanent spot in many of the players’ hearts.","August 4, 2015","true","37.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The story is one of the best ever, it keeps you interested till the very end making you play mission after mission as hours fly by. Striking drug deals, visiting strip club and shooting adult movies - the list of activities goes on and on. And once you've completed a mission you can just drive around and enjoy a simple but beautiful sandbox while listening to a great soundtrack with hilarious radio DJs and commercials (or jump into a tank or assault helicopter and have an hour or two of good old-fashioned genocide fun).","September 5, 2013","true","69.1"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

The 80's style and excess, rags to riches, Scarface driven theme is a perfect setting. The radio is fun and nostalgic and helps set the tone as you go about turning the characters drug deal gone wrong to being on top of the criminal underworld of Vice City. In terms of how the game holds up 12 years after it's initial release. The graphics are quite rough but I seemed to forget after half an hour or so into playing it. The story is over the top but has Rockstars usual humour. The gameplay has it's flaws but the positives far outweigh the few negatives. The driving is simple and allows you to do movie-esque chase scene turns. The missions are varied enough that things don't get repetitive. 9/10","November 29, 2014","true","53.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

With 1980's charm pouring out of its ♥♥♥, it makes of a unique entry in the series, being riddled with several nods and references to events, and Movies/TV shows (notably Miami Vice and Scarface). The gameplay is your run-in-the-mill post-GTA III formula a.k.a a free-roam sandbox. You go on missions to kill people while protecting and optionally developing your own dirty business that will eventually pay for itself to eventually achieve vengeance. While the story is linear, being a sandbox game, you have plenty of freedom. In addition, you have several sidequests, such as Vigilante and Ambulance mission, or item collecting, with worthwhile rewards, like increased Max Health or Missile-Firing Choppers. The game supports both Keyboard+Mouse and Gamepad modes, which puts this game ahead of its time in this particular aspect.\n\nThe cons are fairly simple fixes. Being a pre-HD era game, the game isn't optimized for Widescreen monitors, and while there is an in-game option for Widescreen, it steches the HUD and just crops the top and bottom. This can be fixed either by playing it in 4:3, or via simple mods for true, uncropped/unstretched Widescreen. Another issue that may affect most modern rigs is that you may have trouble getting the game to run. This again can be fixed through simple tweaks.\n\nIf you're gonna get into the GTA games and don't mind playing something that's only a decade old, this entry is definitely one that shouldn't be overlooked.","December 28, 2014","true","55.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's an amazing combination of RPG, adventure and anything you want it to be.  The graphics for when it came out and the general structure of Vice City could not be better, and the concept of course is, in my opinion, unbeatable.\n\nThis game offers so much and if you do not wish to do a particular mission, because you are bored of dying in it, there are always plenty of side missions, secrets and hidden objects to hunt down.  Or you can just drive around picking up prostitues and banging them in your car (perhaps then battering them to death to get your well earnt money back); whatever your preference, this game offers it all!

For me, no other two games do it better. This was actually the first GTA title I ever played back in the day, and to this day is still my favorite. No description needs to be made about gameplay, it's fantastic and entertaining just like every other GTA on the market. But for those who have good taste in music, and want to take a ride in the classics, and really just want to feel like you're in one of the best decades ever, then this is where it's at. Not much else can be said except it's great fun, has a good story, and is completely addictive.

It was my first in a long line of Grand Theft Auto games, and I couldn't have picked a better game. It sucks you in immediately with its music, sunsets, cars, music, and cast of celebrity voiced characters. It has just the right size of world to explore, from the beautiful sunsets of Ocean Beach, to the heavy influence of Cuban and Haitian influence of Little Hati and Havana. Most of the missions have a laugh or two in them, even if some don't, you can just ignore it, chill out, and listen to the impeccable music on the radio. If you are wanting to play a Grand Theft Auto game, buy this one first. If you are looking for looking for a new game to play, buy this game.

This is less of a review and more of a, "here's what you need to get it running perfectly on PC." Because, by default, it doesn't support widescreen resolutions, you need to force v-sync, it has a number of bugs that can be fixed using a patch,\n\nLet's start with the controller. This modder, Silent, is a diety. They've done so much for the classic GTA games. They modded the GInput inputs for 360 controllers so that the 360 controller button will actually appear on screen, not to mention function since Rockstar really didn't bother with controller support for the PC versions. Also, the controllers can be set to the style of GTA IV gameplay. This mod has full support of other controllers as well, such as the Dualshock and most certainly Logitech controllers. I haven't tried the Steam controller on it though. Download it here: http://www.gtagarage.com/mods/show.php?id=24272, you'll be able to pick out Vice City from the options given. Once download, just unzip and follow the instructions.\n\nTo get GTA Vice City working in widescreen, you will need to download a fix from ThirteenAG. It's extremely simple. Just download, unzip, and read the instructions. https://thirteenag.github.io/wfp#gtavc You'll also see widescreen fixes for GTA III and San Andreas if you haven't gotten to those.\n\nTo force v-sync, it's going to depend on whether or not you're using an AMD or Nvidia card. I have an AMD R9 280, so if you have an AMD card, you're going to want to access the Radeon settings, go to the gaming tab, find Vice City, click it, find a tab that says "Wait for Vertical Refresh", hit the drop down arrow, you want it set to always on. On an Nvidia card, you want to open the Nvidia control panel, go to 3D settings, find Vice City from the drop down bar, select it, scroll down til you find v-sync, and same thing, set it to always on.\n\nThe SilentPatch is necessary if you want good lighting and shadowing. http://www.gtagarage.com/mods/show.php?id=25368, you have your options to choose from the classic GTA games, but be sure to also download the DDraw patch from the same set of downloads. It improves the draw distance. Download both files, extract, and read the instructions.\n\nThat should be about it. I hope you enjoy the game as it is quite a lot of fun. Brilliant soundtrack. Good story. Fun side missions (asset missions). Doesn't take itself too seriously. It's a solid 9.0/10","February 16","true","17.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This is still and always has been a very nostalgic game for me and one of the reasons I developed a taste for 80s music.

But graphics is not all about a game. GTA Vice City offers a great story, characters and the feeling of freedom in its beautiful open-world city, that only few other games manage to capture.\n\nThe refferences to the pop culture of the 80s are to be found literaly everywhere in Vice City, which accomplishes the atmosphere of the 80s' Miami, which the game aims to recreate in its own unique style.  The style of the people that you see in the streets, the cars, the buildings' architecture and the scenery all help you immerse with the game and makes you feel as if you are watching a movie, rather than playing a game.\n\nThe soundtrack that Rockstar have compiled is divine, topping even those from the newer entries in the GTA series. All the radio stations in the game are absolutely fantastic with songs from the titans of the 80s' musical scene like Michael Jackson, Ozzy Osbourne, Mr. Mister, Toto, INXS, Laura Brannigan and many others. Even if you don't like this kind of music, the game will make you fall in love with it. But there's more - the radio stations' DJs will make you laugh all the time with their comments on topics that satirize different aspects of the life in the 80s. And the commercials too!\n\nThe story of the game is also brilliant. As if it is directly taken from a classical gangster movie. Filled with action, twists and many great characters you will be thrilled from the start and until the very end. But even after the completion of all the story missions you will have to spend many more hours if you want to unlock 100% of the game. The game will offer you more than at least 20 hours of sheer fun, but no doubt you will want to come back again and play it over and over again. But if you don't like playing by the rules, you will still be able to find lots of fun things to do. Steal a car, go on a rampage, attain a six-star wamted level and have some fun blowing up police and military vehicles and shooting SWAT teams with tons of great weapons, as they try to stop you.\n\nMore than 10 years after its initial release GTA Vice City is still the excellent game it used to be. If you have not had the chance to play the game until now, do not hesitate and get it right away.","January 1, 2014","true","54.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I've played it through about 3 times now, and I doubt that I won't play it again in a few years. Get this now if you somehow haven't played it yet.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Horrux/recommended/12110/","Horrux","Horus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Horrux/","700 products in account","This is a much better game than GTA 3. The design of the missions remains of the "try again" false-difficulty type, however. This means many missions are impossible to complete the first time around, as you have to know what to expect beforehand. This completely ruined GTA 3 for me, but this game is much more enjoyable for some reason. Perhaps it is the fat that I have found a way around the 30 fps cap, running at a smooth 60.\n\nThe missions seem better thought out, the action improved, especially shooting. However, the long and unskippable cutscenes at the beginning of each mission end up grinding on my nerves after a while, given that most missions need to be undertaken a number of times before succeeding.\n\nOverall a very good game, one that I have trouble stopping playing, even today in 2015.  Proof is, I have finished all missions, but still find it fun to do things in the world of Vice City.","January 8, 2015","true","28.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I mean it's truly a fun game, and even though the graphics aren't great you can have a fun few days beating the game.\n\nI know I've said it already, but I love how it's such a fun game, yet the graphics aren't great, so it makes you run 30 fps on the cruddiest of computers.\n\nThe 80's feel is nice, there are a lot of odd NPC's on the Street, and you can have a lot of fun playing this game.\n\nCheat Code: I'm not going to get in to all of the Cheats on GTA VC, but one of the cheats I like is "ILOOKLIKEHILARY" it turns your Character in to Hilary King.","August 3, 2014","true","10.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is the best GTA due to it's design.\nThe concept is simple. Open world and there are missions. The missions introduce you to new features in the game, or you can explore and find them yourself. San Andreas has the same design but the expanded world does not accommodate the game feel. San Andreas, GTA 4 and GTA 5 all have bigger open worlds than Vice City and therefore more to do in a sense (more time to waste). As a game, Vice City is the perfect GTA. Because, the open world is big, but not big enough for you to lose your way. Vice City is more simple and therefore better as a game. I never found myself wasting my time in Vice City. In San Andreas, GTa 4 and 5, myself and even you, always find yourself drivng around aimlessly, killing random people...sure this can be ammusing at the very least, but it won't compel you to keep playing the game. Vice City is a smaller game in scale and therefore the games design works.\n\n75/100","July 1, 2014","true","1.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have played many of 100s of hours since it's launch on PS2 back in 2002, I own it on pretty much all platforms now.\n\nThe cheesy 80s, Scarface setting is what most attracts me about this game, I love the era even if I myself was not born in it. It's vivid colours and bright neon lights makes it very colourful, especially if you start painting you car with the blood of an unsuspecting pedestrian. This is a gory game, but it is comical. The story is great and the gameplay is a hell of a lot of fun. Graphics are top of the range but why does it have to be? The many collectables and side missions just keep you playing. Even when you've completed everything you still find yourself running around cauing chaos wherever you can.

This game has by far the best main character, map, and radio station compared to all the other GTA’S. the only down side about this almost perfect game is the missions with the toy helicopters which are nearly impossible to control with a keyboard and extremely challenging to control with a pc controller. Those few missions dropped this game to almost perfect to unplayable on pc. This has been a major problem for many years and it’s probably never going to get fixed.

Amazing story (If not perfect), fun and awesome gameplay and the best Radio Stations of all the world.\nI dance like a maniac while listening Radio Espantoso and, to that dancing, add awful singing skills with Flash FM. It was a great part of my life and I cherish it as one of the best games I've ever played.\nIf you haven't played it yet, you should be ashamed.\n\nNote: Just like with Grand Theft Auto III, this game have some issues with Windows 7 (It's highly possible that with Windows 8/8.1 as well)\nI recommend that you check the forums to see the easiest solution to this problem.\nAs I've said in my GTA III review, it would be amazing if Rockstar could release a patch supporting higher resolutions. I had to play GTA 3 at 640x480 (Yes, as awful as it sounds)\nBut, please, don't let that issue to convice you the other way. This game is, in my opinion, the best game in the entire Grand Theft Auto series.","September 25, 2014","true","9.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I hadn't played it in years until I bought it in the Summer Sale 2014 along with all of the other GTA games for PC.\n\nI played it on PC way back as well as on PS2 (mainly PS2), but I was too young to really remember too much. I really prefer it to all the newer GTA games and would play this over any other game in my Steam library, but I'm really biased since it was probably the first game I ever played.\nIf you haven't played this game before, you have to get it; just not for PC. It seems really broken, which would be fine if it was only visually. It's just a ton of game breaking stuff that holds it back:\n\n- Alt tab out and you lose the ability to rotate the player with your mouse (which... is pretty essential) until you go into your settings and toggle around a bit\n- Motorbikes wobble\n- Game seems to crash (just a black screen, not an actual crash) after starting a mission (which is why I'm writing this review rather than playing it)\n\n\nThe sad thing is that I only actually got 27% though the game before, despite putting a lot of time into it. I was young, car races turned me away from the game - too hard. I'm sure it'd be an easy victory for me now.\n\n\nOverall: 110% recommend. Oh, and the radio music.\n\n","September 29, 2014","true","7.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The hardware needs are trivial compared to todays machines.  I look for games that don't cost too much, and would play well on a variety of my machines, as well as allowing the possibility to add mods that would push the engine further.\n\nPlenty of PS2 era games are still amazing, and have that nice bonus of being playable on even low end setups (usually... god help you if your rig is less than this :/ )\n\nI digress, if you see this on sale, snatch it up.  I personally prefer this to SA, but SA has the land and the vehicles, so it wins every time.

Freedom to move, plotlines to follow, plenty of hidden tricks and secrets, but none of the stupid, grinding character-changing elements of its successors and imitators. It simply oozes 80s style, Miami Vice meets Scarface and has a party on Carlito's Way. And the radio is so good, I have literally sat in a car with a hooker listening to Chavez on VCPR.

The Vibe, Story, Graphics all of it sold this game for me. It is a fantastic experience. I liked the combat even though it wasn't too much improved from GTA 3. The Story is much better than 3 (The Main Character actually talks) and is a lot like the Movie Scarface. (Tommy Vircetti = Tony Montana pretty much)  The Radio has much more better tracks in my honest opinion.  (Even Michael Jackson is on the radio) The graphics were slightly better than 3 not too much improved but improved. The Missions range from assassinations to flying an RC helicopter or to being chased by a chef. Even if some missions are repetitive and annoying and if you fail it you have to DRIVE all the way back. The map is a 80's spoof of Miami, Flordia and it looks and feels fantastic. a All in all it is a fantastic experience and well worth the 10 dollars I spent on it. 8.5/10","September 26, 2013","true","9.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I personally prefer San Andreas, but there's no doubt that Vice City is a masterpiece, surpassing San Andreas in both the setting (80's Miami) and music (fitting this setting nicely). Vice City improved on GTA III by adding a nice story with a better protagonist and side characters, expanding the soundtrack, improving the shooting mechanics, adding motorbikes and helicopters (now you have a Hunter to cause chaos alongside the Rhino) and a lot more side content with more rewards. It's also easier, meaning that you can have a good time for longer without dying or getting busted. The map also feels more well designed and consistent, and the mission variety is also nice. In the end, Vice City was and still is a brilliant game, among other GTA's and on it's own.\n\nAgain, i recommend you to install at least SilentPatch fo fix bugs and issues, and the Widescreen Fix if you use a widescreen and GInput if you wish to play it with a controller.","November 2, 2015","true","25.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zer0wned/recommended/12110/","Zer0wned","Zer0wned","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zer0wned/","151 products in account","My favourite GTA game by far. The combination of an 80s setting,great story(plus the amazing soundtrack)gives this game a never-ending charm. This is the only GTA game where I have just sat in my car and left a song playing. The soundtrack of this game is basically a "greatest hits of the 80s", so you could buy this game just for the soundtrack.\n\nNow, lets talk about the gameplay. While the game isn't too different from GTA 3, it has some notable improvements. Helicopters are now available to fly and the dodo from GTA 3 is now a proper plane. Motorcycles are also available. Aside from some new weapons, the gameplay hasn't changed much from GTA 3.\n\nThe story takes elements from Scarface and Miami Vice to create a solid plot. The story has all the usual stuff you expect from a GTA game like betrayal and the rest.\n\nOverall, if you are a fan of the 80s or miami, or just GTA in general, then this game is well worth playing.","July 3, 2015","true","12.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Second only from the length of gameplay though does it fall behind San Andreas, excluding that it has the best campaign of any GTA I've ever played. I remember when it came out that my desktop could barely run it maxed and now my laptop maxes it out with an Intel HD 3000. I decided to mod it up to modern expectations and after many google searches and overhauls I settled on Vice Cry as a base for expansion. Vice Cry tripled the view distance, replaced the meshes for the cars with the xbox versions (higher detail), applied a wide screen and resolution fix, and many other little things. It doesn't replace the Ginput system with the Xinput system (for 360 and PS3 controllers) but there were many guides to replacing it in the community guides that I found in a few seconds. If you can't get your mods running just use the old no-cd patch, name it gta-vc.exe, and Steam will run it fine allowing CLEO and dependent mods to run. NOTE Vice City modders prefer the 1.0 no-cd exe for compatibility reasons but I chose to use the 1.1 exe, no particular reasons, so either works if you have picky mods or crashing. ♥♥♥♥ cheats, get VC Dream and forget about them.","June 30, 2015","true","23.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Again, it is your typical GTA game, going around  doing missions for people with shady characters, buying properties and shooting cops and gangs. Even today you can enjoy Vice City as much as any other AAA game. This game is proof that graphics are not everything.

That doesn't mean the game shouldn't be played, though. There are many improvements over the first GTA in 3D (GTA III), but I didn't enjoy this one as much.  If you decide to install the texture mod "Vice Cry" (which, by the way, it's pretty good) beware because it might randomly break your save files. After starting a new playthrough with the mod and playing for a week or so, I couldn't load my save file any more and I gave up trying to fix it. Just save in different slots so you don't lose everything, but otherwise I recommend installing that mod and playing this game. And, as always, the music in this GTA is outstanding (specially FLASH FM!). In fact, the music is so good that you'll reach your destination and won't get outta the car until the song finishes... and if you are not quick enough, you'll be stuck in the car listening to the next song too. Worth playing, even if it's just to see the evolution of the GTA franchise and experience the 80's through its soundtrack.","January 25, 2015","true","8.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game improved alot since GTA3 and addition of motocycles was amazing feature that i wish even GTA 3 had.\n\nThankfully this time around our main character isnt a muted baby like in GTA 3... meet Tommy Vercetti a member of Italian mafia who has been jailed for 15 years due to inconvienient set of events that happened, and his back in Vice City. Vice City is visually astounding and i love how they potraited 1980-s with visual design plus the choice of music. Music is what i think the most important part for me in Vice City because there were so many good songs that i just kept switching between radios cuz i couldnt get enough of everything.\n\nGameplay is smooth, shooting is fun and missions were less frustrating than in GTA 3 (imo) except that ♥♥♥♥ing demolition man mission which i would throw in the trash can and fire anyone who had idea on this piece of ♥♥♥♥. Also we have option to buy property, once we completed few missions we can purchase properties and we get some bonus missions from them that earn us cash and progress toward the end of game. Characters in this game are unique and full of cultural refrences... for example Danny Trejo was voice acting a character named Umberto Robina a cuban leader for whom you had to do some missions and you become A MANG WITH BIG COJONES!!!!\n\n[CONS]\n\nFUUUUUUUCKIN CARSSS AGAIN SWIRLING AROUND LIKE MADE OF PAPER bouncing little bit of an oversteer and bum bam paff on the roof and dead from car explosion....thats why i love motorbikes.\nCops were very easy.. yes at 5 stars cops barely do ♥♥♥♥ unless you get out of car but while in the car you can go where ever you want and they just ocasionally bump into you.\n\nGame has random difficulty spikes.. at certain points of the game you just have like a monster of a difficulty spike and im talking like people having miniguns and ♥♥♥♥ and if you dont get away youre dead meat (happened in missions randomly but only once or twice).\n\nI wish there was a way to store all your accumulated clothes in the game (yes you had clothes but only after completing missions that insisted on you having those) otherwise i have to run to each place in which i completed a mission just to get that unique look.\n\nRockstar introduced melee weapons into the game like hammers screwdrivers chainsaws etc... while this does sound quite exciting you will never be in a situation where it would seem fitting to use them or viable for that matter.\n\nFaggio-s need nitro xD\n\n[CONCLUSION]\n\nGTA:VC is a masterpiece that everyone should experience and for that im giving it 7/10.\nMASTAPIECUH","June 4","true","21.5"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EpicB/recommended/12110/","EpicB","Blargman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EpicB/","150 products in account","The second GTA game i played back in the day. Vice City came out on the PC in 2003, i picked it up and played it somewhere around 2005 to 2007. Quite possibly my favorite GTA of all time. Im a sucker for anything 80's so that further heightened the experience of this game. If you haven't played this one i would highly recommened playing it.\n\nThe story is more intereresting than GTA 3 imo; it takes alot of cues from 80's films, and television. The aesthetics of the world really work in its favor and really makes you feel like your in the 80's. The various car designs, the npcs, and even the many easteregg references (Scarface mansion, Miami Vice music and cops) really addon to it.\n\nThe gameplay is still the same from its predecessor. You have the ability to jump, run, sprint and crouch like GTA 3. There are new weapons in this GTA; compared to GTA3 having one set of weapons, GTA Vice City has atleast 4 sets of weapons from small to heavy.\n\nFor the music you have yet again a really well picked soundtrack. You have a combination of 80's hip hop to Rock, to Newwave and Synthpop. The sound effects were well made for its time. As for the voice acting you have a couple of celebrities (Ray Liotta as Tommy Vercetti) Dennis Hopper, Burt Reynolds, Gary busey etc essentially a top notch performance and an interesting choice to have them voice the characters given their backgrounds.\n\nAll in all, its well worth the money and its another great GTA experience.","April 5, 2015","true","9.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Despite being one of the earlier PC ports of the 3D GTA titles it's relatively easy to control. There's a surprisingly large amount of graphics options for such an old game and especially one to come out in this time period when consoles were king in developers' eyes, so kudos to Rockstar for actually thinking this out.\n\nI really think that the 80's are the perfect decade for GTA. The decade of decadence. Crime was getting more common, drugs were getting harder and easier to get, and the media was getting more violent. It was a time of total unhindered immoral activity. It basically screams Grand Theft Auto.\n\nThe soundtrack is amazing. I'm really into heavy metal and new wave, so I'm very biased when it comes to this kind of thing, but trust me, there's nothing like running over pedestrians in a muscle car while listening to Iron Maiden's "Two Minutes to Midnight" or fleeing from the police in a taco truck while blasting "Video Killed The Radio Star" by The Buggies.\n\nThere's a wide variety of melee weapons, and while the guns are nice I think the wide variety of weapons such as the chainsaw (straight out of Scarface) and a ♥♥♥♥♥ really set the tone for the game.\n\nTommy Vercetti is also a great character. He's beautifully two dimensional and the writers didn't try to ♥♥♥♥♥foot around that. He's a cold blooded Mafia hit man who's been released from prison after killing 11 guys and he's still ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off. He's not an Anti Hero like Niko Bellic who's just trying to get the American Dream, nor is he an Anti Hero like CJ who's trying to protect his neighborhood from drugs and rival gangs. He's just a really bad guy. If you cross him, he will kill you. If you mess up a job he's on, he will kill you. If you don't pay him, you guessed it, he will kill you. It's that simple. His American Dream is making others' lives a nightmare.\n\nHowever, there are two things I don't like about this game though. One is the graphics. The models, especially the character models, are terrible. They haven't aged well, and the game was obviously made in 2002. This is especially noticeble when the various "sexy" female characters are onscreen, because while they are obviously human, they basically look like they had their breasts and hips glued on. The wacky 80's hairstyles have a simaler problem, as do the brightly colorerd clothes that the majority of the main characters (and Tommy himself) wear. They look as if they've been painted or nailed on to some kind of puppet or mannequin. I honestly think that the models in System Shock 2 looked better than this.\n\nThe second thing is the lack of multiplayer. Add the fact that MultiTheftAuto is terrible and you have a huge problem. I understand that when Vice City came out, the main focus was on the PS2, which at that time still didn't have online multiplayer capabilites, so it is forgivable, but still, it's disappointing.\n\nOverall, I think this is the greatest Grand Theft Auto game out there. Yes, even better than San Andreas. It's just totally tubular.","April 1, 2014","true","3.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Nothing like driving down Washington Beach at night listening to Flash fm to make you feel immersed. The graphics are very stylish with pretty lighting effects specially prominent at night. It also helps that the game has amazing radio stations that also give a bit of backstory to recurring radio stars in the franchise, like Laslow. Vice City feels very alive.\n\nPlot pretty much feels like a tribute to Scarface, this is clearly visible in the last mission. There's references to Carlito's Way and Miami Vice. The story features memorable characters and awesome moments with one of the best protagonists in the franchise. Tommy Vercetti is a ♥♥♥♥ing boss.\n\nI hope the next GTA takes us back to a remastered Vice City in the HD universe.","September 16, 2015","true","12.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

But when I played it again, I realized that the game didn't age well. Nonetheless, GTA:VC is, in my opinion, still the best entry in the GTA series. The locations, the beach and the sun makes you think more about your next vacation than about what is going on in the game, the retro style is cheesy but cool, and the characters may not be as realistic as the protagonists of later entries, but they are way more fun. Another thing I noticed is that the driving mechanics aren't realistic at all, but as a result driving a car down Vice City's streets provides more fun than "realistic" controls ever could. I still love the game, but I could not bring myself to play it more than two hours. I know that it is a superficial reason, but I couldn't stand the old graphics anymore.","August 15, 2015","true","3.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Well, unless V is good but after IV.. Anyhow, the game is great, it's funny, it's got a PERFECT 80's atmosphere, with probably the most kickass soundtrack in a game. The radio has some witty banter, but the music is the best part. The graphics are a little aged but you can install some graphical mods if you're willing to learn a little bit about modding. The game is best played with a controller, but otherwise, it's Grand Theft Auto, the story is the best out of all of them, it's got likable characters and movie references all around. Everyone says San Andreas and IV are the best, but I can tell you, anyone who has played Vice City will tell you different. Just give it a go, most modern computers can run it and it's pretty cheap. If you're a fan of the series, do NOT pass this up. No complaints besides maybe it could do with a little better kb+m support.  9.8/10.","July 6, 2012","true","19.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The downside of it is that any time you hit a wall, even if you just tapped it, you fall of your bike. I really like fast cars/bikes, but you need it so the guy doesn't fall off so much. I like the beach, how when you go on it you slow down, and I also like how it's so large. The colors arn't very diffrent, and by that I mean that every color has the same tint to it, if you know what I mean. (I'll update this when I've played the storyline. Why I writing a reveiw right now is to talk about the quality in the game, and I don't think I need to have played the storyline to tell you that.) All in all, great game, lots of fun, and a must-buy. A great game if you want a taste of how GTA works. (Ah, before I forget, you can only play this with a keyboard. No touchscreen support.)\n\nP.S. If you think that because I havn't played this game for long I can't give a true review, you are wrong. I have played 100+ hours of San Andreas on the window's store, so I'm comparing it to that one in particular. I have also played every GTA (Exsept for the first two that were 2D) out there, so I know what I'm talking about.\n-Secretgamer","September 15, 2015","true","1.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It is a lot more open to what you wanna do than the Previous GTA which was something Rockstart wanted. Brilliant game for the time so you will have to have a history of the Series to enjoy this game.\n\n8/10","December 21, 2014","true","5.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","4"

Either Steam hates Rockstar or Rockstar hates Steam, as this is the only reason that can explain how insanely difficult it is to get some of these classics to work on newer OS and graphics cards. Ever single one of these Steam ports (III, Vice City, and VI) has some serious glitch that requires far more tweeking and adjustments to the launch settings than necessary. And not once has either Steam or Rockstar done a single thing to fix any of them. Instead, you buy an unplayable game, one that won't even start up, one that you cannot get a refund on, and neither company gives a damn. It's the equivalent of buying a hard copy game, opening it up, and realizing there is a manufacturer error that makes it unusable, and both the manufacturer and the merchant who sold it to you have an attitude of "Oh well, you got what you paid for, sucks to be you. Don't bother asking us to fix it, we don't care." And before you think this is just one person's system issues, go look in the forum at how many people can't get the game to start and how there is zero assistance from Steam or Rockstar, as neither are trying to solve these issues or fix the digital copies they fraudulently sold people, knowing full and well that it did not work with a newer OS. Compound that with the fact that these problems have been ongoing for almost 4 YEARS with no real resolution, and you can understand why I cannot recommend this version of GTA Vice City to anyone.","April 24","false","56.5"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

You can do the same thing like every other Grand Theft Auto games, but you cant swim :(      Enough of that. Ive missed this game alot since ive had it on the PS2 many years back. All the characters like Vinny and Vance Lance and etc are like attached feeling through a video game. Its many years old i know that but its still pretty fun if you are on the lookout of trying some of the old school GTA games. I would recommend this a try. Its fun, action packed and really cool to try with the old Rockstar game engines","April 15, 2013","true","15.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The game itself is great even though there are issues with it. The most apparent issues are with compatibility, mostly on Windows 7, 8 and 8.1. Problems ranging from audio and graphic glitches ... screen/game freezing .. to mouse controls not working properly. But you could expect these for an old game and many (if not all) can be fixed by adding fixes/workarounds. Now to the core of the game. I remember it fondly playing it over a decade ago. The gangster story, all the vehicles there for you to use, cool missions and side-missions, adult humor. To this day I remember all the little details about it. Yes, the combat was and still is clunky but who cares when it is fun. An added bonus is that you do not have to deal with RGSC in this game. The game is awesome and is missing just a bit more polish to be as good as the sequel San Andreas. But just like SA it suffers from licensing and how Rockstar treats digital distribution of games. Because you DO NOT OWN IT when you buy it here, you just borrow it. They might change the game when they wish and as recent events have shown they can remove stuff. Songs, options, fixes and in this way also all of the mods made throughout the years. Sometimes they swap it with a mobile port entirely. Vice City already had stuff removed and this will go on in the future. So as time goes your copy of the game on Steam gets worse and worse ... while old disk copies and even pirated versions remain the best quality available. THIS is why I do not recommend buying it here.","May 24, 2015","false","0.5"," 19 of 44 people (43%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","43","19","44","2","1"

You win some, you lose some. I remember loving the ads for this game. Hearing all those great tunes and watching your guy drive around in a Ferrari like Sonny Crocket was magical. Unfortunately, after almost 12 years of anticipation, i realize the actual gameplay isn't.\n\nI think the biggest problem is that it is a console game. The save system is absolutely abysmal. You need to drive 5 minutes to some out-of-the way checkpoint to save, then you need to spend another 5 minutes driving back to the guy who gives you your mission, then your mission sends you 5 minutes driving somewhere else, then if you die on your mission, you are forced to repeat 10+ minutes of garbage time just to get where you were when the action started. This would have been bad enough in 2001, but in 2015 when there are thousands of other games on Steam it's unforgivable. Woeful checkpoint system aside, the mouselook is really jerky and it's almost impossible to aim your guns or fight on foot. Pretty much the only thing that rocks in this game is driving around aimlessly in a Ferrari listening to synthpop, and then i might as well just be watching Miami Vice in the first place.","June 17, 2015","false","9.4"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","3","12","0","0"

If you're thinking about buying this game ORRRRR you have problems running it, then this is my info:\n\nThe game runs fine, almost zero problems. Read on to understand the "almost" part.\n\nI have a legal Win 7 pro 64bit, updated... Computer specs:\n\n*Intel I7-4790k (I don't use the integrated GPU, which BTW is known to be problematic, with no update in sight, since 2012!!!!).\n*16GB RAM DDR3-1800.\n*GA-Z97X-UD5H  motherboard (Gigabyte).\n\n*Crucial M550 -256GB SSD (the game is installed on this drive, maps load in a blink of an eye on SSD)\n\n*Nvidia GTX560 (single fan, NEVER BUY A GAMING GPU WITH ONLY A SINGLE FAN! NEVER NEVER EVER!).\nThe driver version is 347.52, which is pretty updated (being an experienced PC tech, my moto is "only touch things if there are problems. From experience!).\n\nAs I said, the game runs fine. Graphics are maxed out, 1920X1080, frame limiter on (don't remember problems if it's OFF, I use ON for smoother picture on my LCD screen), Wide-screen OFF (no need, it's automatically widescreen, choosing ON changes the... shape of objects, but the game runs fine either way), forced huge anti-aliasing thourgh Nvidia control panel and other graphic enhancements and the game still runs fine, and looks a bit better.\n\nOnly problem I have is that sometimes, when launching the game (I always double click the desktop shortcut), nothing happens. I have to click again to make the game run. Sometimes it says the "game is already running", so I wait 20 seconds and click again and it works.\nOne time, maybe twice, had to go to the task manager to close the VICE CITY application running, and then click the shortcut again to make the game finally run. I think it's all steam related (many times, Steam says it can't log in, although the net is fine, and I have to click the game shortcut again, at which time Steam suddenly sees that my internet connection works and lets the game launch).\n\nThe game does have a problem with mission tree execution in a few of the missions (the porn film mission for example), but I think that is related to the game code itself.\n\nA SOLUTION to most of the above problems is to make a shortcut on your desktop (or wherever) of the game's EXE (start a search on your drive for "vice city", it's suppose to be on Steam\steamapps\common). Then, through Steam "Add a non-steam game"* (choose the shortcut), and now the game launches much faster.\n\n*Ok, thinking about it, maybe you don't even need the "add non-steam game" part. Try without first, see what happens.\n\nSo... Why a negative review? Well, specifically because of the GTA San Andreas update fiasco, that I read about (luckily before buying GTA:SA). An update that basically downgraded the game, and removed content... And there is no option in Steam that I can find to disable updates (to Steam or to games) to prevent situations like this. Or an option to revert an update.\n\nBecause of that, I lost my faith in Steam and Rockstar. Don't know if I'll keep buying any more games through Steam. And about Rockstar, the developer of GTA... Wanted to buy more GTA games, but... Don't think that will happen anytime soon. Or ever. Lost my faith in you guys. You want to remove songs and  remove HD resolutions (which people say worked absolutly fine), and to do that to people who already bought the game, without their consent??? WHY?\n\nSad sad sad. OK, About VICE CITY the game, in itself:\n\nThe good: If you remember the 80s with fond, this game will be nostalgic for you, in almost every way.\nUnlike GTA3, it has motorcycles, and the aeroplane flys much better. There's also an attack helicopter and it is cute, although helicopter have very bad flight control, it's just annoying to fly them.\n\nThe bad: With all updates, and the advancement of computers, you would expect an option in the menu to load the entire city to the RAM, to avoid the loading screens (which on SSD end up as a very annoying "epileptic" flash).\n\nAlmost all missions are childish and stupid. Most of them are easy and stupid, some are a bit hard and stupid. Feels like the game was meant for 6 year olds. Which is wierd; With all the 80s theme, and the R-rated subjects, I expected a more grown-up approach.\nUnlike GTA1, after you finish the missions, there's not MUCH to do in the game.... Which is against the very idea of the Sand-box type of games (same thing with GTA3).\n\nThere are more bad stuff, but only game developers will be interested to hear.\nLet's just say, if you must play the game, then come with VERY LOW EXPECTATIONS. VERY LOW.\nPrice wise: 10$ is a bit too much for this game today.","May 9, 2015","false","228.0"," 7 of 21 people (33%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","33","7","21","4","2"

However the controller support is terrible considering the lack of use for one. all buttons are alien to what you remember and reconfiguring them is a nightmare. adding in the fact that there is no setting for using LT/RT meaning less buttons it certainly defines how awkward and frustrating it has become.\nIf you wanna buy this game get an old playstation","March 18, 2015","false","2.6"," 1 of 9 people (11%) found this review helpful","11","1","9","0","0"

I love the asthetics, the music, and the protagonist, but this game has not aged well. The controls are all by unplayable, the aim is off, the movement is clunky and stop-start, and your health will drop faster than your desire to play this game after the nostalgia has worn off.\n\nI want to like this game, but frankly, I can't stand it anymore. It just isn't fun. The difficulty is too high, the controls are too bad, and the good points don't outweigh the bad. I recommend you go get yourself "Scarface: The World Is Yours" instead.","May 20, 2015","false","4.1"," 1 of 9 people (11%) found this review helpful","11","1","9","0","0"
