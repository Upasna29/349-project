I'm not sure how much more gametime I'm gonna get out of this. Overall it's a pretty nice game, and I didn't encounter any issues playing - controller support was a nice bonus.\n\nI would recommend it, but probably not a full price, solely given that I don't think there is more than 3-4hrs gameplay.","October 27, 2015","true","1.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/UltimaLyca/recommended/392720/","UltimaLyca","Rye Roen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/UltimaLyca/","190 products in account","Daily Espada. Weird, weird game. I have a lot of mixed feelings on this, it was kind of bizarre to play.\n\nIt’s a 2D action game based almost entirely on fighting bosses. You fight a few rooms of enemies on every floor, but mainly it’s about the bosses. I wanna get the negative stuff out of the way; the game has this overwhelming feeling of cheapness to it, and I’m gonna say the biggest contributors to that are:\n\nOne: the lack of an options menu which means it’s impossible to change resolutions etc in game, which is a pain because the game is in windowed mode by default. I’m sure you can modify it in the ini file, but it should really be available to change in game. Bear in mind I have a promotional copy of the game, so the lack of options might be something that’s fixed on release.\n\nAnd two: there is a window within the window. The game only uses about 50% of the screen real-estate. Now, I think an element of this is an artistic choice in order to seem more comic book-like, but honestly I think it’s mostly in order to decrease the resolution and make it easier to run. (Developers have informed me that Alt+enter goes full-screen)\n\nSo those things combined with lazy-looking animations and a kinda lacklustre art-style, as you would expect, cheapen the whole experience.\n\nBut it’s actually a pretty fun game. For the most part the boss fights are well designed in that the bosses are predictable, yet challenging depending on what difficulty you play. I played on the level 4 difficulty, and found myself going back again and again after dying before forcing myself to lower the difficulty. If I didn’t have a review to write I would have kept this game as something I keep returning to in order to have another shot at the boss.\n\nIt’s fast paced and feels a little bit like megaman with the ranged attack, but there’s also melee. There’s quite a lot of special moves that are pretty satisfying to pull off when they’re charged up, and there’s a relatively unique mechanic with the power suit. I won’t go too far into it, but basically you have armour and then your health, but when your armour breaks you also do severely reduced damage while you wait for the armour to recharge. It’s pretty cool and encourages the player to switch up their combat style.\n\nSo the combat is pretty solid. I like the design of the bosses but… when they speak i gotta say it’s kinda cringe-worthy. The voice acting is amateurish but the actual writing is good. The e-mails you get from your wife and daughter are laugh-out-loud material, it’s really good stuff. You get them, usually between bosses, and it gives you this weird insight into the main characters “normal” life.\n\nSo a strange game. The combat reminds me of something like Dark Souls being fair as it is, but it also has a low-quality aspect to it. For ten bucks, I'd say wait for a sale. You'll get a few good hours out of the game, maybe even more depending on the difficulty you choose, but it's just a liiitle on the expensive side. If it hits about $5 - 7 I think it's completely worth the purchase.\n\nIf you'd prefer a video review, have a look here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcMea-Fll1k","September 30, 2015","true","2.3"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","8","14","0","5"

I thought the idea of a game that involved competing in a game show where you fight against mythical Brazilian creatures was interesting. Unfortunately the theme is kind of disappointing. The story is actually pretty good and it does a good job introducing the different creatures. I really wish the theme would have had an impact on the actual gameplay though.\n\nThe gameplay in Daily Espada works like you would expect from a typical action game. You have a sword and a gun. You need to kill enemies while avoiding their attacks. The one unique thing that Daily Espada does is give you two different forms. In your normal form you can lose health and die. In your supercharged mode any damage you incur will just hurt your armor which will eventually force you back into your normal form.\n\nMost of the game revolves around fighting the boss of each level. Each level does contain some small rooms were you can face off against some weaker enemies which will unlock some upgrades that you can equip to your character. Most of each level focuses on the boss fight though. The boss fights are interesting.  If you like action games that focus on the boss fights I think you can get some enjoyment out of Daily Espada.\n\nDaily Espada is pretty short though with only five levels/worlds. Unless you want to replay the bosses at different difficulty levels, you might not get a lot of playtime out of Daily Espada.\n\nIf you don't love action games that focus on the boss fights, I don't think Daily Espada will be for you. If you love 2d action boss fights though I think you can have a quite a bit of fun with Daily Espada.\n\nNote: I received a free review copy from the developer.\n\nRead My Full Review [www.geekyhobbies.com]\n","October 4, 2015","true","1.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Daily Espada is the example how you can make even the darkness beautiful and useful. Fast and immersive world of reality show in which you, the normal person, is trying to kill big monsters and earn rewards for himself and his family. Fast, interesting and intensive combat with numerous combos, attacks to choose from and making countless combinations.

Our hero will be given a sword and a gun and forced to fight against hordes of Brazil’s greatest mythological creatures in exchange for fabulous prizes.  The sword gives our hero the power to transform in a super-sentai kind of way, donning a black suit with red accents that give you additional more powerful combos and a super ability. The gameshow’s rewards are fantastic, and will ensure our heroes family will be set for life.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJocF1uCaqQ\nThe first thing I noticed about Daily Espada was the colors, the game features a dark background with beautiful bloom lighting and the colors are fantastic. Unfortunately this can get a little confusing, with the enemies being black, with accents of color, and the player wearing a black power suit with they are transformed. The result is that the only color on screen is the players black and the attack animations, which creates a striking picture consisting of lights and darks. Lighting is sufficient at most times, but more than once I found myself confused by the dark.\n\nThe gameplay feels good.  It’s the best of 2D style hack and slash. Controls are simple, but leave room for both high skill and new players alike. The core mechanics are classic hack and slash, see enemies shoot then and slash them, until they die.  This is fleshed out with a combo system that while simple to use is difficult to master.  Most rooms feature a chest that can be unlocked by defeating its enemies. These chests contain upgrades that get you better and more exciting combos and slashes. The bosses are big, and the enemies in between offer just enough depth to keep the game interesting.  The average boss fight took me about 10 minutes to complete!\n\nThe games map is almost like a metroidvania game. A central Elevator corridor houses elevators to each level, the layouts of which are often labyrinthine.  I often found myself retreading the same floors fighting against the same enemies while trying to find a boss elevator, or figure out where the heck I was.  Aside from my inability to remember where I had and hadn’t been the game would benefit immensely from a map, however not having one lends it a difficulty and a mystery that makes for interesting if slightly repetitive game play.\n\nDaily Espada’s story is well told through voiced story bits, emails that you pick up from terminals and signs on the wall.  It’s a simple story told as far as I can tell in 4 acts, one for each boss you fight. The game then gives you the ability to continue on to harder bosses, but to mention more would be spoilers, so go play the game!\n\nFor a game that started   ut as a free tech demo on itch.io this release is extremely well polished, I found very few bugs, and the visuals are nothing short of stunning. The bosses feel huge and even on moderate difficulty levels gave me quite a bit of trouble. I love the colors, and the arcadey sword play is easy to learn and hard to master. The story lacks a bit, with much of it told through text terminals, but for what it is I really liked Daily Espada. There are half a dozen difficulty levels and tons of re-playability built in. The story was short but not lacking, and I was satisfied with the length of the main story (about two hours to play).","September 30, 2015","true","0.2"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","17","1","6","0","0"
