"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sphing/recommended/296550/","Sphing","Sphing","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sphing/","477 products in account","Intro - About   This first-person puzzle game is very atmospheric and tranquil with a unique design, forcing players to choose the correct path to progress. This minimalist game has a major "Wow!" factor and is quite beautiful. The open scenery is jaw-dropping and the puzzles are difficult but fair. The puzzles get harder and harder as the game goes on, leading to the discovery that you have far more power than you once suspected. Discover things you never thought possible and explore a utopian city that feels like a lucid dream!\n\nPros & Cons\n++  Pros\n+ Great graphics\n+ Astounding sound\n+ Fair and unique puzzles\n+ Beautiful scenery\n+ Flowing animation\n+ Easy controls\n+ Easy navigation\n\n-+ Either Or\n- No real “skill” involved (This can be good for casual gamers, but the hardcore crowd might not enjoy it.) +\n\n-- Cons\n- Lacks action\n- Very short\n- UNREACHABLE PLACES (This is rare but, in a game like this, it can ruin enjoyment.)\n\nSummary  You appear in a sky chock full of floating buildings that contain puzzles to be solved, leading to more and more puzzle. You will discover otherworldly architecture and the secrets behind their creation. Find your way through serene mazes and deadly traps to face that which you seek.\n\nPersonal Opinion     This game is good for anyone who loves atmospheric games. It is very peaceful and tranquil with no heart pounding action, so for the action lover it is not a good fit.It can be very exciting and engrossing, but if you repeatedly fail a puzzle, the game can get tedious. Besides that, the game flows very well, pulling you into the dreamlike realm.\n\nFinal recommendation:  My final recommendation is  7/10 . The puzzles are good, and the graphics are appealing. The graphics are meant to be minimalist but a bit of detail would have gone a long way to make the game look even better! The easy controls allowed me to jump straight in and begin my adventure with no fiddling with keybinds. The sound effects fit perfectly, and the animation is quite smooth. The unique art design is something I have never seen before and, honestly, it had me awestruck the whole time. I recommend playing the game in a quiet room, where you can properly get your head in the clouds. This is a very solid title. I recommend it to anyone who can appreciate a well put together game but doesn't need intense action.\n\nEdited by Frey Cloudseer\n\nIf you found this review helpful and want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow here!","September 30, 2015","true","5.9"," 28 of 30 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","28","30","0","3"

Its puzzles aren't basic, they're complex, very interesting and funny.

I would say 40-60% of the game is platforming; a staggering amount considering there was no mention of platfomring on the games various pages.\n\nThe story of the game is supposed to be a narrative experience in a puzzle elemented world; but the narration is not told through vocalization or words, rather relying heavily on the 'dream world' element. It does not do a good job of providing a feeling of connection or emotional suspense. Information about the character and her story is told very abstractly, leaving much to the imagination. I never was able to understand why she was having issues, or even what they were.\n\nHow you experience a world through the level design is tied directly into how you enjoy the world, and understand what is happening. Unfortunately instead of walking you through the mechanics one at a time in order to then progress to a more difficult 'puzzle' (platforming element), they are mixed up in difficulty in a nonsensical way. Mechanics are introduced with no warning or time to learn how to use them, instead you are being chased or in a time crunch with no idea how to use the tools you are given. Because you have no clue what to do or no time to figure it out, you have to progress by failure; swimming through tubes without a breath bar, falling off of ledges continuously in order to get a jump perfectly, dying over and over again in order to accomplish the goal. It's not about just figuring out what you need to do, but understanding how to use those mechanics throughout the design. Dying over and over again due to failure in design takes away from the connection to the game, and just adds to the frustration.\n\nThe game overall is very lackluster. It doesn't respect your time. The story is vague, and the game drags on with childish puzzles and platforming elements that require many deaths to get through. I cannot recommend this game for it's standing price. If you would like more details on my comments, please watch the video review.\n\nThanks for your viewership and support; for more videos click here.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/SocioPsycho","January 27","false","4.2"," 20 of 31 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","20","31","0","0"

It starts off with a hand drawn cartoon (not sure what was going on, but hey) before dropping you into the first area. There are no instructions as to what to do, but if you move around (the usual WASD / space) *look* at things and activate things (E), it becomes obvious, though it might take a couple of attempts. The puzzles (so far) have been quite easy to solve, but equally quite satisfying - all (so far) things you'll likely have come across before (pressing buttons in the right order, lining things up, a bit of platforming...) and there are clues as to what to do. There's also some nice sparse background music which adds to the atmosphere & the general surreal feel of it all.\n\nA couple of gripes though - if you hit escape during play, you're presented with some pretty unhelpful menu/symbols one of which just closes the game down without warning (though in hindsight, it does look a bit exit-y). Also there's a bit of 'precision' first person jumping required which I find annoying - the controls are a bit skittish, which isn't helpful when you 10 levels up in the air...\n\nApart from that, highly recommended!\n\n(Also - a free hint - if you're underwater and hear your heartbeat getting louder, you're about to drown! )","July 17, 2015","true","8.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Surroundings, soundtrack, artwork, level design and everything about this game is an aesthetic pleasure. There were a lot of times I found myself not caring about the puzzles and simply idling with enjoying the atmosphere the game has to offer.\n\nPuzzle mechanics are quite unique and it never gets repetitive. 18 levels feel like 18 different worlds that you encounter and get through with playing "the dream". Puzzles are not that hard; it only requires a sense of logic with tying things together and you have the "Aha!" moments with several of them.\n\nYou are experiencing the conflict between a girl's past and the consciousness with visiting the events that had happened in her past, from which some of them are not very pleasant. Though the devs kept the story part rather obscure and left it up to translation of the player, which is no less than I would expect with such a surreal game.\n\nPursuing and getting the achievements were also quite the satisfaction. I can say that this is one of the few games that didn't make me complain with starting all over for the missing achievements.\n\nOverall, this game is a hidden gem among the other well-known first person puzzle games. It lacks the love and the attention it deserves in my opinion. With appreciating the developers, I highly recommend this game.","May 7","true","14.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The music is beautiful and matches the emotions that Niko is going through - which also makes you empathize with her story.\n\nThe graphics are run with the Unreal Engine to really make those colors pop out at you like a little kid jacked up on sugar.

The puzzles are easy but quite enjoyable; unfortunately the developer decided to put more and more emphasis on platforming elements towards the end of the game which don't work out too well. Playing with keyboard and mouse, I felt the controls were too wobbly and it took me more attempts than it should have to solve the rather simple platforming segments.\n\nThere's also a severe lack of visual settings. The developer offers ini-workarounds in the Steam discussion board for FOV, arbitrary resolutions and some other important settings but I feel it shouldn't be hard to include these in the in-game menu. Apart from that, the game's performance was flawless as expected (1440p, GTX 970, i5 4570).\n\nDespite the aforementioned shortcomings, the audio-visual presentation and the majority of puzzles are still highly enjoyable and make Niko:  Through The Dream a pleasant experience for two or three relaxing sessions. Very well worth it for the low asking price.","July 21, 2015","true","5.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/smegheneghan/recommended/296550/","smegheneghan","Jakebob-Smegheneghan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/smegheneghan/","212 products in account","An intriguing game. A friend showed me some of the game, and it looked rather neat - a puzzle game with platforming interludes, and story that's shown, not told. A lot of it's up to interpretation, so you can take as much or as little as you want from what you see. The hidden scenes and items rewards thorough exploration and expert execution of gameplay; however, some are a bit rude in that reaching them involves doing things that ultimately gets you stuck and requires that you jump off the level to respawn at the last checkpoint.\n\nGameplay-wise, barely anything is repeated to the point where you feel like you're going through the motions. There's nothing that's done only once in the level, but there's nothing that's re-used in later levels with an irritating twist (ie time limits). Every level holds a new challenge, so you're unlikely to get bored.\n\nThe puzzles start out simple, and sometimes have a hint to the solution in plain sight (though you might not register it at first); at other times, they can be rather difficult to conquer, to the point where you'd be tempted to look up a solution. Some of those puzzles guard unlockables, but others guard the way forward, so it can become a bit frustrating. The platforming is the sort of thing you'd expect from something built in Unreal Engine; some sections can be rather difficult to surpass because of finicky jumping mechanics, whilst others are a breeze in comparison.\n\nThe graphics are freaking amazing. Lots of eerie backgdrops and landscapes that range from bright and cheery islands to darkened tunnels lit only by glowing mushrooms, distant lights, and the eyes of creatures looking to swallow you whole. It's all thematic, of course - going along with the story, everything is representative of something involving the story being told. Which doesn't stop the game from looking quite wonderful.\n\nThe music is quite nice as well - going along well with the themes of the levels, occasionally bringing me back to games I'd played before with the way instruments were used. Going through a factory level, the music reminded me of the old Crash Bandicoot games on the PS1. It, too, plays into the story, though more for setting the tone than anything.\n\nIn the time I watched it played by a friend, and in my time playing it, the game only glitched out once - the time I was watching my friend play, a platforming section bugged out and became unwinnable due to a platform reversing its solid state; this was fixed with a reload of the map. The rest of the game was bug-free, which is to be expected.\n\nIt's not got a long run-time, but that means you can dedicate a day to sitting down, playing through the game to completion, then finishing it with 100% achievements.\n\nIt's definitely worth the low price that the developers are asking for the game, so I highly recommend giving it a look!","August 1, 2015","true","3.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

The game itself is extremely enjoyable to play, as the puzzles involve a large variety of different tasks. One puzzle might deal with colors and colormixing, while another deals with sounds and memorization. The best part is that you aren't sure what to do with each puzzle, and you aren't told how to solve them. You aren't shown what any of the objects in the game do, either, so you're on your own to figure out their purpose and how they work. The puzzles aren't easy, but they're not too hard that you're stuck on one for hours at a time. It's a perfect blend between difficulty and simplicity.\n\nThe atmosphere of the game is astounding. It's very simple, but very beautiful. The lighting and skyboxes are really impressive for an indie title, probably my favorite atmosphere in any indie game.\n\nEach area has it's own unique twist that defies logic in it's own way, whether it be floating islands, impossible structures, or insane contraptions that wouldn't exist in the real world.\n\nThe story is told through puzzles and sketches (not a narrator), and is easily open for interpretation. One of the most enjoyable ways to be told a story, in my opinion.\n\nNiko: Through The Dream is a puzzle game that really nails the idea of creativity and imagination. It's one of my all time favorite puzzle games, right up there with the Portal series. I recommend this game to anybody looking for a great puzzle game.\n\n\n\nWith it's wonderful aesthetics and atmosphere, to it's complex puzzles and incredible story telling, this game is easily...\n\nan 8.5/10","July 18, 2015","true","5.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Clearly the work of developers who had great ideas, and put them together with care. Deserves much more recognition, especially in the genre of First Puzzle Platformers.\n\nThe environments look beautiful, and the soundtrack has many soothing beautiful tunes that in general match the ethereal feeling of the surroundings. The animations might look simplistic, but in no way this hinders the game, or robs it of the soul it has. If anything it seems to show the care the developers had even more. The game is very honest, not pretentious, and that won me over the more I played it, even if I was skeptical about the opening custecene, at first.\n\nUsually games of this genre seem to explore a few mechanics on a large number of puzzles with small variations. This game felt a bit like the opposite, A very large number of mechanics and different patterns scattered in groups of very few, if not unique puzzles that never quite repeated. For me that personally was great, as the game felt like a fun exploration and the experiences always felt fresh. Only two or three puzzles seemed badly designed or "unfair", but that was ok as they were very brief and not repeated exaustively throughout the game.\n\nI think this game belongs with Antichamber, Portal, The Talos Principle, The Witness, and any other First Person Puzzle games, even if it is in some ways more modest (and this is not something bad or to be held against it). It's sad to think a great game like this might not get the recognition it deserves.\n","February 17","true","20.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I have played many platformers advertised as such, this one advertises itself as a puzzle game. It is more platform than logic puzzles. Can't really recommend based upon my experience and the developers description. Good idea here but it tries too hard to be something everyone will find entertaining.

Below are the reasons.\n\nYou can't skip cutscenes. I'm okay with the story cutscenes but the camera goes into cutscene mode where it shows the results of your interaction with a puzzle for example. You can't skip those, even when what it shows is very obvious. After the 10th time it becomes a bit boring.\n\nAt one point I kept pressing W on my keyboard while a cutscene was playing, after the cutscene was done I was looking against a wall, sliding. I guess the game still accepts the input and moves the player while a cutscene is playing.\n\nOnly options in the game settings are screen resolution and Vsync. You can't even mute the music or change controls.\n\nYou can't save the game, it has checkpoints. I wanted to mute the music before I knew it wasn't possible, I was halfway done with a puzzle in a scene, paused the game, the three buttons on the pause menu are icons, they contain no text. So I clicked on one which looked like settings to me, turns out it's main menu, had to continue the game from the last checkpoint, which is the start of the scene. Game has no checkpoints on multiple step puzzles I guess.\n\nLightmapping is of low quality. Either very compressed or low resolution.\n\nMovement felt a bit too smooth to me, it could be more precise.

I had moments when i spent like 2 minutes just holding W while jumping and not being able to get over it, and when i finally did, i fell to the ground and had to start again.\n\nThats my main reason why i think that this game shouldnt be bought, appart from that, we could talk about the lack of options on the options menu.\n\nThe rest of the game is a pretty fine combination of art and relaxing music. But i totally forgot about it when i got stuck in this "winter" level.","August 9, 2015","false","1.3"," 3 of 13 people (23%) found this review helpful","23","3","13","0","2"

The hand drawn animation that starts the game looks like it was made by a 10 year old. Almost none of the settings are configurable, including mapping buttons, so you'll be moving around the maps using arrow keys like you're playing on a Commodore 64. Don't bother complaining in the forums about the game's shortcomings, the developer just deletes the posts without responding and bans you from the forum for pointing out problems with the game. I'll be requesting my refund from Steam.\n\ntl;dr - Niko: Through The Dream is a waste of money.","July 17, 2015","false","0.2"," 15 of 49 people (31%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","31","15","49","2","3"

In that respect i'd say it's done pretty well. There's alot of different puzzles in it for sure.\n\nThe story is still something I'm trying to figure out, it's one of those games where there is little to no talking and alot of it come in the form of secrets you have to activly search for\n\nAt first glance the game looks uninteresting and lacking in detail, I say it's not about the detail, it's about how much you use it. The game knows how to build atmosphire pretty well, this in mostly because of the music and ambiance.\n\nThere are some things I have to critisize though, the intro cinematic feels way too long, and there are times where your inability to walk slow definitely tests your patience, but over all, I'd say this game is just shy of 8/10 and I'd say it's worth your money.","March 22","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The beginning was particularly imaginative.  I had hoped that this  game was more rich in puzzles and atmosphere than in platforming, but the platforming became very irritating as the game progressed, and I do not have great skills in that direction.  There was no indication when I bought the game that there was a strong platforming element. I think this should be included amongst the description tags.\nHaving said all that, some gamers may well find this game very worthwhile.  I only wish I had the ability to complete it, because it is very beautiful.","March 20","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
