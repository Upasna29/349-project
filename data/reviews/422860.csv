Even though it is Early Access, there are a lot of gameplay unlockables to master in what is currently available and still lots more to come in the months ahead.\n\n\nTo many, Holodance and Audioshield may look similar in comparison but Holodance looks for you to match the beat in deliberate and specific challenges that keep you dancing with well animated backgrounds and a fun dragon in the intro level.","April 5","true","1.7"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

I love the music, and how the notes change between the different tracks. This is one of the first games i show to any of my friends who likes rhythm games.\n\nI also enjoy the menu area, its a platform in space with floating music orbs that you can grab with the Vive wand and spin around. Some play music and some poof  little smoke rings!\n\nI look forward to checking in each week to see what new songs and levels have been added.

There's a dragon in the living room!  It wants to be my friend and dance with me"\n\n"Don't encourage it, son."\n\nSo!  At long last I was finally able to give this one a try.  I had been watching videos while failing in my chair shaking my remotes about and crying so I would say that I wanted to play this a bit.  I played quite a bit of Rock Band back in the day; I can't even recall how many times I mangled my drum sets and had to fix the damn things.  I enjoy rhythm games, I am somewhat musically inclined and what not.\n\nWhile starting out, I found myself standing in a gorgeous tropical setting perched on a holographic dance pad.  After taking in what I could of my surroundings I caught glimpse of a dragon.  He was a big guy, rivaling the size of a bus, and he landed right in front of me nearly crushing me.  I instinctively dodged to the left, his snout grazing my right cheek.  Such arrival could have been the dragon wishing a fight so I glanced at my hands to see what tools of death the game provided.  Two small handles, not dissimilar to the rubber grips one could find on bicycle handlebars.  What trickery is this?!\n\nThe dragon spoke; honeyed words for sure, foul beasts are ripe for deception and misdeeds.  I payed little attention to the toxic words he was trying to poison my mind with.  I was poised for combat but in an odd gesture the dragon raised it's hand in an attempt for a 'high-five'.  Some sort of taunt to lure me off guard.  I told the creature that I would acknowledge his facade of honor, perhaps a sort of bow before attempting to slay one-another.\n\nWith a slap of the... claws?  My hand had become scaled!  The illusion quickly wore off as the dragon withdrew to the sky.  The handles I held seemed to activate not long after turning to... Sock'em Boppers?!  Removing the tainted heart from your pleural cavity will be more fun that a pillow fight!  He will surely use his gained height to add speed to his attack dive.  I decided to use the crucial moment to my advantage and attack with all the fury I could muster.\n\nIt was then when the beast came to a hover when I begun to truly fear for the worst.  He had been trying to lull me into a calm with catchy music.  Such a trick would only work on an infant; but I was caught off guard for the orbs.  The orbs begun to careen towards me and I instinctively raised one of my hands in a vain attempt to sacrifice only a limb so the rest of me could dodge any further onslaught.  However, instead of having my hand seared with burning agony the orb burst into light.  Then it happened again.  I was able to withstand the assault without as much as a scratch.  Could I have been wrong?\n\nThe display of lights continued to emanate from the airborne creature, the arrival of the orbs seemed to correspond with the musical progression.  I found myself actively involved in a sort of game: I was enthralled!  Only later did the thought cross my mind that this could have been an attempt at hypnotizing me but I continued to play this dragon's game.  Each orb I struck I found myself further and further involved in the music while the dragon looked on.  I was willingly aiming for trick shots and exaggerated movements for an extra sort of style; I even found I could break the orbs upon my head without any harmful effects.  By this time I was completely absorbed in this activity with no hope left to resist the temptation of the beast's game.\n\nEventually the music came to a finale and the dragon ended his light show with congratulatory utterance.  As the following deafening silence rang in my ears, I was reminded of how a cat will play with a mouse before landing the killing blow in an attempt to exhaust the poor victim so it may attack with much less risk of a retaliatory strike.  The blood fled from my limbs and face as a bead of sweat rolled down my brow.  I let my guard down at the worst time and I would pay the ultimate price for such negligence: death.\n\nAs the beast came back for a landing, all I could do was take a pitiful step back in a hopeless attempt to delay my impending doom.  In my potentially final moments I tried to take in as much as I could: the flowing foliage undulated around me with calming ocean sounds.  Such a place could be considered a vacation spot but I thought I would only find my eternal sleep in this place.  But what I would most vividly remember was something that shook me to the very core.\n\nThe dragon raised it's paw and presented me with a gesture.  I immediately recognized this gesture to the universal symbol of both friendship and approval.  Had I been deceived?  No!  The fist bump was an unalienable sign shared among those who would be considered close.  This being I feared and reviled suddenly approached me as an equal with no intention for hostilities.  I first considered this dragon to be dishonorable but I immediately begun to question my own honor.  In my short life I have only seen dragons as vessels of chaos and destruction so my prejudice only blinded my vision of the peaceful one who was before me.  I raised my hand which had become that of a dragon once more.  I looked into this creature's eyes and returned the eponymous 'Bro Fist' that he offered.\n\nSo anyway, that's how I got to level 2.\n\nSuch friendships are often born from surviving a struggle but this was a struggle from within.  It is odd to find someone who you once considered a hated enemy to become a most treasured friend.  This dragon taught me the errors of my ways of viewing his kind with only preconceived opinions of anger and fear.  My heart feels much more full after finding warmth and hope where I before only knew pain and darkness.  You cannot judge a book by its cover and you cannot judge a dragon by his scales.  At least until your dad reminds you it's just a video game.  A damn good one at that; one that I am very eager to see progress through Early Access and come to fruition as a strong leading title in this VR frontier.  As I was once very hesitant to buy Early Access titles from being burned in the past, I was able to look past that moniker and find a real gem.","April 27","true","5.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","7","8","2","2"

Holodance will literately make you dance while hitting those spheres in perfect sync to the music. This is a completely different experience than algorithmic-based music games.\n\nIn the current alpha state there are only 3 songs, of which every single song will get stuck in your head for hours or days (Gosh, I would buy the soundtrack just for the Level 1 Song!). There was put so much effort and love into the game. The Voices, the animations, everything is just wonderful.\n\nThe Holodance-Team announced that they want to add an editor and Steam Workshop support.

It definitely needs more levels and it seems that Alpha 51 introduced some performance issues but I just had a session hunting for achievements and that was so much fun!

Currently it has the most play time out of all my VR games (23 and counting) and I’m not even close to being bored of it. Alpha 53 has added loads of content with more coming – so the lack of content for me isn’t an issue anymore.\n\nWhile it will never have the unlimited content of AudioSurf,  the game really does a good job at making you feel like you are playing the music. This is something that I found AudioShield lacks (since the gameplay is generated by the computer.) Because of this, you really get into the music and it provides a much more immersive feeling. The characters also add a level of interaction which is greatly welcome versus other game’s barren stages.\n\nOverall this game is worth the price of admission and I suspect it will be a must have for VR once fully released.\nJust keep in mind that this is an early build and  you will run into some bugs, but it still playable and a blast to play!\n\nTLDR: Quality over quantity.
