This means that you don't need  5 processors, 8 fans, 2 PC cases or anything alike to run this game with 60fps or more. I actually like this style of art, it's simplistic and easy, so your computer doesn't get burned down! Anyway, the models are very high res, they're also pretty bad*ss whilest  being made by a developer who knows what he's doing. The SFX are basic, the textures are quite basic (the ground probably has the best texturing in the game) but the game runs just fine. Hopefully you get my point, this game is for gameplay but not for graphics.\n\nBuilding\nThere's tons of parts to build from, such as tank cannons to energy generators. Your vehicle will have its own needs, such as head income and outcome, so you'll need to slap a block or few to tackle  them. However, your vehicle has very limited space, even the large category is quite limited. You can even change how high up the suspension is to alter weight! The building is quite in-depth, but content is still lacking. The balance isn't that good at all, I can take sacrificing speed for more cannons, but the other bots always get me from behind ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) So I can't really kill them without placing a cannon that rotates 360 degrees and hopefully can aim low enough to kill them. But I guess it does make some sense, the Overly Powered builds can be strong going head to head since it's the place of the most firepower, but weak in the back. So I guess it has many challenges waiting to be found out about, you can even make a car that goes 200mph and falls all the time. So this game is fun for the player being able to make crazy builds.. as long as the player has the scrap required (scrap is the game currency to fix, upgrade, or add more parts to a vehicle).\n\nPros and Cons\n\nPros:\nVery fun game to make random vehicles in\nIf your car has too much cannons for its weight, it will be kicked back from the cannons once fired\nTons of customisability\nTons of parts\nCheap game\nEven a computer with 2 gigabytes or RAM could probably run this gmae on high settings.\n\nCons:\nBasic textures\nDead game with little to no players\n\nFinal Ratings\nWolffacritic score: 79/100\n\nGraphics: 6/10\n\nGameplay: 8.9/10 - So much to do!\n\nCustomisability: 7.5/10 - Good amount of content with more to come\n\nI have been gifted the key by the kind developers of the game.

The developers gave me early access to the game and I very pleased on the work they have done so far.\n\nThe vehicle building in the game is quite fun, there is an endless amount of things you can create, as the building system is not that limiting. I managed to create a huge driveable tower that was so big it went out of my camera range, my buddy also made a driveable dingerdong and named it ♥♥♥♥ destroyer and so I made a futuristic Star trek portal thing and he stuck his vehicle in mine, it was quite a good time.\n\nThis game is unfinished but still at this moment in time it is an awesome game to mess around with friends and have a laugh.\n\nThere is also a level based system so that the more you play, you unlock more items to place onto your vehicle. I havnt unlocked everything so I am unsure of this but so far all the weapons are just kinda bland, I am still unure if there is like mortars or some sort of missiles in the game.\n\nBesides that it is worth it!\n\nGameplay/ First Look:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJu6zkbi-Jg","July 7, 2015","true","2.4"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","18","23","2","0"

I found very interesting that every little thing you do on your car reflect on its behaviour. So you will have to manage weight balance, energy consumption to steering.\n\nAnother cool thing is that there are a lot of unlockables, so you would get after one or two games, new armors, weapons, engines, new parts of all sort.\n\nThings I didnt liked in game, first there are sound effects, I found engine sound after some period of playing is anoying that can easly distract you from enjoying the game.\nSecond and less important are lack of game mods and maps.\n\nDo not take this as valid cons, since I played game in early access, and found developer very friendly, supportive and helpful.\nSo I belive that they will try fixing this things I mentioned above.\n\nOveral:\nGame is fun and worth trying\nMy rate at this point with game standing where it is, would be 3/5","July 8, 2015","true","1.2"," 22 of 32 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","22","32","2","0"

Constantly getting updating, and ive actually ran into one of the Devs in game and asked him a couple questions. No Micro-Transactions and some pretty interesting mechanics. Different from robocraft in some ways (Such as a 3 meters like Heat, Energy and a "Metal" meter.) When your Heat gets too high or your energy gets too low, you cannot fire your weapon. At the beginning of the game everyone has the same amount of "Metal" (The resource that yo use to buy upgrades and add weapons.) to add items such as engines, weapons, and even more compartments for metal. When you destroy an enemy, you can drive over their remains to pick up metal for later use. When you reach the maximum amount of metal (Indicated by your metal bar) you can go back to one of the beams which brings you back to the creation menu to buy upgrades, than you may return to the game. Really great game that I prefer over RoboCraft. 8/10","October 23, 2015","true","2.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

And compared to its state two years ago, this has actually taken pretty big steps. Only the good parts didn´t change at all, e.g. the gameplay itself.\n\nwot is dis?\n\nThis actually is one example of a yet unnamed genre, I call it Build and Fight, call it how you want. So the genre of Robocraft and Homebrew (since they added guns now with the latest update). Gameplay is simple: Build stuff, destroy stuff, collect stuff and repair and build stuff with your collected stuff. ez.\n\nbuild stuff?\n\nYes. You get a nice range of parts and then you just build a vehicle out of it. How it´s used and built is up to you, whether you want a lightweight ram with dozens of engines doing 400 km/h or a giant a55 tank with dozens of cannons or something rather normal, depends on your imagination. Building itself is really easy, but also depends on physics.\nRemember: Even though you can put enough weapons on your vehicle to eradicate complete europe within seconds, you can´t expect your vehicle to do 150 km/h, like in Robocraft. The limit of how much you can put on your vehicle doesn´t depend on your player rank, but on the servers scrap limit. So, compared to Robocraft, this is balanced very well. Also, you can tune the suspension on your vehicle to edit the handling and center of mass.\n\nrange of parts?\n\nYou start off with a chassis and a cockpit. You can choose between three chassis yet, a small lightweight one for cheap and light vehicles, a normal one and a big one with enough space for at least 3 million engines and cannons. Then you build on energy generators (because guns need energy to work) and batteries, cooling parts  (because guns get hot while firing), armor to not die the second you get out of the garage, engines, guns and extensions to get more space you need for another 1 million engines.\n\n\ncan i play dis on my potato?\n\nYES YOU CAN. JUST DO IT. (sry)\nIf you compare this to other games based on Unity, this game has excellent performance and looks fairly nice.\n\nAny cons?\n\nExcept having almost no players, not really. This is Early Access, so you can´t expect this to be 100% bug free, but so far In the last year I played the demos of Scraps, I haven´t encountered one bug.\n\nThe End?\nIn my opinion, this is the greatest example of this Build and Fight genre. Robocraft is nice, but these idiotic rank limits and nonexistence of balance are really unnecessary. And to be honest, no one knows how long it will take until Homebrew gets into a well playable state. Buy this. Please. We need players here. For real.\n\n\nk thx bai.","May 19","true","2.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","2"

But it still has a bit more to it, you have to watch how much "Scrap" you have used and make sure you are not over budget. But you can always upgrade later in game in the build menu once you collect Scrap you ether took from another vehicle or found on the battlefield. In there is a new function where you can choose to Repair, Rebuild, or Repair and Rebuild, which is one of the most useful functions since I started playing. You can outfit your vehicle with ether a lot of guns for a high firepower vehicle , or a speedy vehicle with just a few guns but is quite faster. I personally prefer the faster vehicles because I can run around shooting other vehicles without them shooting me as easily, it all depends on your playstyle. You can also ajust your suspension, as real life physics goes the higher your vehicle is the larger of a chance it has to flip, your chassis or other parts will take damage if it hits the ground, its less of a thing to worry about if your into the cornering at high speeds. You really have to watch your weight once you get into the larger designs because a small vehicle can actually weigh quite a lot even when lightly fitted with guns. Larger engines are a must for even small designs, unless you like to sit around and get shot, which is always a laugh if you made your vehicle out of anvils. In order to get your guns to fire you need Generators and some form of Cooling, your engine can provide some power but not nearly enough for you to fire your guns, I will not say too much for those who hate spoilers. So I will leave the different types of guns out of this review and just do a overview of some types. On the topic of guns you have recoil of each wepon, the machine guns have less recoil, so much less that its not noticible with a good engine, the cannons have some noticible recoil, especially once they get into the larger size, be careful of fireing off more than one of the larger ones at one time, this can often flip your vehicle.\n\nNow for the Pros and Cons:\nPros:\nFun\nCars\nGuns\nEngines\nPretty good AI\nGoes Boom! quite often\nLoads quickly\nCould almost run it on my 7 year old junkyard laptop\nThe ability to make vehicles really quick(Speed and Designing it)\nVehicle editor is easy to use\nSelection of Parts\nPhysics\nDecent selection of guns\n\nCons:\nNobody ever on Multiplayer except on the weekend games, a few people join then\nA slightly limited parts list, I'm sure the parts list will get much larger over devolepment\nNo Search for your vehicles, it gets confusing when you have a list all mixed with not too much order.(except aplhabetical)\nNo mortar wepon option?\nNot enough wepon options, I want more.\nThe clasic "I'll put a bunch of guns on the sides of my vehicle" almost too op.\n\nOverall this is a very fun game, if you are into building, cars, destroying, or designing you will enjoy this game, its got all of those in one game. Would buy again.\n\nI made a video of some gameplay from one of the weekly games, it can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41FPYdZ86Jo&feature=youtu.be","November 8, 2015","true","49.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Scraps has a post-apocalyptic feel, with  anarchy and violence ruling the barren wasteland and roaming bands of marauders hell bent on killing each other for the few remaining salvageable parts left behind. Game play consist of blowing your opponents apart before they do the same to you. The landscape consist of flat and hilly terrain with evacuation zones randomly thrown in where you can hobble your damaged vehicle in for repairs and upgrades. Currently, there are only a handful of maps to play on so things can get repetitive once you’ve played on them over and over again.\n\nThe assortment of blocks, chassis and weapons you can place on your vehicle is pretty staggering. It’s almost as if the Hells Angels, Mad Max and the local car clubs were selling parts at a garage sale; it’s an impressive assortment and you’ll have a field day picking and choosing the right parts. Once you’ve assembled your vehicle of mayhem, it’s time to hit the battlefield to pulverize your opponents. The name of this game is Scraps but the game is all about total destruction.\n\nScraps is certainly a fun little gem. Probably not as fun as being 5 years old and launching hot wheels cars at your cousin’s dollhouse, but fun in an adult sort of way. Some might say, "Yeah, but Scraps gameplay isn’t a new and it’s not the first." Well, it doesn’t have to reinvent anything – it just needs to improve on the old formula. Scraps might not be the first vehicle combat game out of the gate, but it’s currently the best one out there.\n","July 19, 2015","true","0.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Not many players at the moment so works best with a group of friends. Designing vehicles then fighting each other or the AI is alot of fun (AI ranges from stupid to over powered).\n\nAlso has a basic unlock system for getting more parts. Keep in mind this is early access so its not perfect and more content will be added etc according to the dev but its a good effort for the money.

There is a level-up system to keep things in check.\nThe game is fun until you've unlocked everything (xD), the physics used in the game is awesome, just like your typical car building games.\n\nPros:\nA "sandbox" mode but really a Vehicle Editor\nServers are provided however since the game is early access, not a lot of players are on.\nVery simple to learn and play\nThe physics in the game is interesting\nYou can make a awesome vehicle design that you can have an Ai pilot so you can test your own design as if you were going against another vehicle similar to it\nAn actual anti-upside down system although takes a millenium to activate (xD)\n\nCons:\nThe recoil on certain weapons are kind of overkill as to some are just perfect\nThe terrain isn't very smooth, meaning if you have a long vehicle you will get stuck and the anti-upside down system won't do much so now you a sitting duck.\nAuto-Save is Utterly useless as to the Scrap Limit is only a maximum value of 50k\n\n\nRecommended?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BlueFeena/recommended/350150/","BlueFeena","BlueFeena","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BlueFeena/","102 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI had been following this game for a while via the old tech demos but had never been willing to pull the trigger on purchasing the game since the demos lacked any real form of game play.  With something playable finally released, I decided to give it a go.  Unfortunately, the actual game play mechanics are awful.\n\nDespite being a car combat game with a focus on building your dream deathmobile and watching it get destroyed in actual combat, trying to actually build a fun car is tedious.  The actual vehicle construction is fine -- however, the developer decided to hide half the parts under a Call of Duty unlock system.  Great, another game to grind away at before I can even do anything.  Another issue is the game's money and cost system.  To put it simply, in combat, you are supposed to start with a basic car and acquire money to purchase bigger and better cars, all of which can be your personal designs.  The way money is acquired, however, is horrendous, requiring players to deposit money on "pads" -- a process that requires you to sit in park for three seconds with a giant bullseye on your head -- as opposed to just letting you keep any earned money in a manner similar to Counter-Strike.  Also, destroyed cars cost money for them to be replaced, meaning that one lost vehicle is all it takes to set you back to square one.  Players basically wind up in an infinite loop of never having enough money to actually do anything once combat begins.\n\nThe actual combat itself is lousy.  The only vehicle design that really matters is how many massive cannons are strapped to your car; speed is moot since the terrains are so mountainous you can barely drive four feet without rolling over.  The game provides little feedback as to when you've been hit; your car gets "hit" and it is nearly impossible to tell where your vehicle is suffering the most damage until half your car has simply been pulverised.  Did I mention that every time a part breaks off your car, your vehicle will bounce?  This basically turns every encounter into a whoever-shoots-first-wins affair.\n\nDespite being in development since 2013, the game is still little beyond a tech demo with a basic AI, little in terms of actual game play, and costs thirteen dollars to boot.  I do not recommend this product.","September 19, 2015","false","7.0"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","11","20","0","0"

However there aren't very many parts in the game, the single player is just a basic arena with AI that don't upgrade themselves and multiplayer could have been a little fun but nobody plays it, everytime I went to check if anybody was playing but all of the servers were empty. I honestly feel like this could be a really fun competitive game if everything is done right.","July 21, 2015","false","12.0"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","36","4","11","2","0"

I have also played car shooting games before, I'm not great at them, but I'm also not horrible at them.\n\nSo, I build a car, and start a game against 3 easy AI players. About the best I did was manage a couple of times to pick up scrap, left over from me blowing up, and rush to the evac. Then I used most of it to make repairs, because of all the damage I got on the way.\n\nNext I thought maybe if I just have 2 AI players maybe it will be easier. I also got the large cannons unlocked after destroying some boxes on the test track, so I thought maybe I can out gun them. Started the game they had the large cannons too, so that didn't work, and I died even faster than the first game.\n\nMy idea of easy is not dying every 30 seconds, nor is that my idea of fun, and my idea of advancing in a game isn't staying on the test track blowing up boxes. So I requested a refund, and hope I get it.","March 23","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

These features being,\nridicuouls gun kickback\nstupidly long grind sessions for xp and unlocking new parts\nmy least favorite the fact that certian items are 2 wwide on a 3 wide car (you cant line things up)\nand finally, the spawns can put you on top of a fight and instantly be killed if someone has a large cannon.\n\nI have a feeling these are easy fixes and i would like to see them fixed.\nEven though the game has bad features there are many great features. Some of these great features are\nreally good physics system\nsmart AI\nwell balanced fighting (if you aim at the generator you can cause way more damage than if you just aim at the cockpit)\n\nI hope this game gets a lot of good recognition and i really want some people to play with online.","July 9, 2015","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
