"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bonnup/recommended/207140/","bonnup","bonnup","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bonnup/","264 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nA creatively imagined multiplayer game. A surprisingly pleasant alternative to the brawler-type of multiplayer that has become so commonplace (e.g. samurai gunn, starwal, towerfall, bit-brawlers, brawlhalla, etc...), SpeedRunners offers players a spectrum of depth in gameplay. At its base, this game is a racing platformer, rewarding players who learn the turns and obstacles of various unique levels while punishing those who make mistakes. Perfectionism at its finest. This fine work does offer a deeper level of competition, however, if players chooses to exploit the nuances of the game's physics. With the mention of the glory of this game, I must also point out the negatives, which are frustratingly apparent within the first 5 minutes of gameplay. The matchmaking system is extremely unreliable, despite the implementation of a ranking system (albeit new). There are constant bugs in just about any multiplayer game, which would be endurable in a more forgiving game. The glitches can be brutal, and, due to the competitive nature of this game, they do not come off as humorous as in other games. At the rate at which this game has improved recently and with the massive community of stakeholders which it has garnered, SpeedRunners, while still in Beta at the moment of this review, will doubtlessly become one of the flawless go-to's for just about any friendly LAN party and competitive tournament. Each complaint I have for this game is tied to a problem that any early access game would have, and they are no reason to avoid a purchase. Currently an 8 / 10, this game is an easy pick-up and a difficult put-down!","June 13, 2014","true","58.0"," 66 of 72 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","66","72","0","0"

You become extremely focused and attached to the game, focusing on beating your opponents on a variety of maps, using powerups on each other, taking different routes and constantly gathering more skill each time you play and that is what I enjoyed the most about the game. Each time you play it, you feel like you are getting better, leading to you becoming attached to the game. It is also a great laugh with friends, using powerups on each other and just being the biggest troll ever. What amazed me was how easy and simple it is to create maps, also the game is workshop supported! Create it in-game, share it instantly to workshop for all of the community to see... it isn't as complicated as map-making when it comes to Source Games (Garry's Mod, Team Fortress, Counter Strike). There is also ranking if you feel confident enough in beating other players and being the absolute best speedrunner.\n\nThe only downside is that the Keyboard Controls are yuck... I have began using a Gamepad and find it easier. You can customise the controls of course but I just cannot find the right setup for me.\n\n\nJust make sure you have friends to play it with!","November 1, 2014","true","10.3"," 60 of 64 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","60","64","0","2"

I still find myself coming back to it sometimes. This game has an original concept that they executed very well, and in result the main part of the game is great.\n+Lots of characters, with different customization options\n+Lots of maps (not a whole lot of official ones, but that's what the workshop is for)\n+Workshop is great, you can make your own levels and submit them, and play other people's as well. There are also top levels of the week, etc.\n+The game keeps updating and in my opinion the updates point to a good direction for the game\n+The community is pretty large, you can usually find people online and there are lots of tournaments and such that are supported by the dev team\n+Leagues, XP, etc.\n\n+-The community is so-so ingame, everyone you play with online is either very nice and mature or just very rude and immature. I haven't really found a lot of the in betweens, though I don't play online a whole lot either.\n+-The AIs can play some workshop maps fine, but others they just get stuck, go the wrong way, etc.\n\n-The soundtrack can get horribly repetitive. It's okay, but I usually turn my sound off because a lot of the time it's the same song and it just gets on my nerves tbh.\n-The campaign is bad. Like, not a little bad, REALLY bad. They should've just kept it out in my opinion. There's basically no story (well there is but it's not much of one), only about less than an hour total to complete it, and almost every single level in it is either way too easy or way too hard.\n-It is crazy the amount of bugs you can find by just playing it for maybe 30 minutes. I understand it's in early access (the time I'm writing it is), but there are so many times where the screen borders aren't really the borders for the level, AIs go the wrong way (only seen this on a couple maps now, they fixed most of them but it's still weird) and the wrong person will get the point sometimes. However, they are also fixing a lot of these, so soon hopefully most of these will be gone.\n\nNonetheless, despite the bugs (the game is still very playable, please don't take what I said the wrong way), this game is awesome. It is so much fun to play by yourself, even more so with friends (jk, like I have a social life or something), and is just overall fun.\n\nRating: 8/10","September 6, 2015","true","91.7"," 73 of 84 people (87%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","87","73","84","9","2"

SpeedRunners features some really balanced gameplay, your skill is your skill, nothing else is the determining factor for success. You will run, jump, slide, and grapple your way through a series of levels, designed by mere mortals, as if they were designed my gods.\n\nThe only downside of this otherwise shining example of video game excellence, is the gosh darned lag! Lag can sometimes mess up an entire match, however, lately the net code has been polished to a shine, and is suitable for those who can't afford the highest internet.\n\nOverall, I would give SpeedRunners a 9/10, it's fun, it's competitive, and it's everything you want it to be.","April 7, 2014","true","42.3"," 64 of 71 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","64","71","0","0"

This did not affect my opinion; I will only recommend games that I like. If I do not like a game, I will not recommend it. Period. View my mission statement.\nREVIEWSpeedrunners is a 2D-sidescroller that mixes in some elements of speed-platforming, combat-racing, and modern MOBA-lite games.  It plays like something you may find as a minigame mode in a Mario Party game.\n\nThe matches are played as a footrace through 2D circuit maps where the object is to get so far ahead of your opponents that they fall of the edge of the map.  There are boosts and grappling hooks you must learn to use effectively on each map to move quickly.  There are also pick-ups like rockets and freezing laser beams to add that right touch of chaos to the races.\n\nYou have the option to play custom matches with bots, or with local players for good-old-time couch coop with your friends.  There are both quick match and ranked match options for automatic online matchmaking.  The ranked match mode has a progression system and point leaderboards.\n\nMost of the variety in the game comes from the various maps.  And the Steam Workshop means infinite possibilities for maps.  Some users have already created some pretty interesting maps.  There are also many characters to choose from, with several of them being crossovers from other games.   They seem to have differing animations but no differences in abilities.\n\nThe graphics are pretty much what you would expect from a modern 2D-sidescroller.  The music and sounds fit the style of the game; and I believe there is a community guide available that shows you how to easily integrate your own music into the game.  The controls are fluid and intuitive; I personally used a controller and thought the controls were pretty optimal.  Lastly, I didn’t experience any glitches or crashing… although some people have reported crashing on certain Workshop maps.\n\nThe game does what it does well, undoubtedly.  With the Workshop and the ease of modding of this game, there is definitely a bright future ahead for Speedrunners and a vast sea of possibilities.  I look forward to seeing what else is added to the game in the future.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","April 29, 2015","true","6.8"," 53 of 63 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","53","63","0","2"

The soundtrack isn't that diverse but has a few catchy songs to keep the races tense.\n\nThere's also a bit to do, with a standard story mode, an online and offline playing system, and even a workshop to create new stages for you and the community to play with, SpeedRunners is quite a bit more indepth with it's content. The game as of this review is still holding the status of being "Early Access", so in the future there may be even more to do.\n\nI do have some issues with balancing: which is primarily centred around the use of items. They're a welcome addition as a whole, but I wish that they were taken out of competitive online play (ranked matches) as they can heavily interfere with your progression in levelling up in a way that just isn't fair. Ranking systems in online matches on multiplayer games that punish you for losing by taking away rank points is a practice that generally annoys me, but the chance of items does bug me even more.\nAnd I just wish that some of the items themselves were tonned down a bit. The golden grappling hook is just not fun to play against.\n\nAnd from my experiences, the game crashes on me almost every ten minutes. Other times it can take a while to crash, once I've booted up the game, and over times it can take under five minutes to crash. My friend doesn't have this issue at all, but from my research, this happens to many people who have played this game. It may be due to the game still not being complete, but if this issue could be addressed as soon as possible, then my enjoyment of this game would be even better, but as of this review; I can't play this game for more than about twenty minutes at max before the game crashes, and I have to reboot it.\n\nOverall though, I'd recommend SpeedRunners if you're looking for something simple to get into, yet enjoyably challenging to master. this game requires practice and patience when playing against good players. It's a new take on racing games, and especially for an indie, early access, the product as of now is a well crafted game.","September 2, 2015","true","21.6"," 42 of 49 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","42","49","2","2"

If you ever wanted to punch your friends in the face, play this game instead. 11/10 you'll want to punch them in the face anyway.\n\nI was fortunate enough to get this game gifted to by a friend, and I was very excited to try it out after seeing all the powerful positive reception. I was very satisfied with my experience, and this has easily become one of my top (local) multiplayer games.\n\nIf you like comedic racing with item pickups (in the vein of games like Mario Kart and Crash Team Racing), then you will really enjoy this game.\n\nThe aesthetics are good - the detail in the environment is nice, and the artsyle is colorful and matches the tempo of the game. The different character models are well-done, and some of them have interesting jump animations (ex: the shark character dives forward and the cat character rides a broom). The music and sounds are very good, however, I usually play my own music to add to the intensity of the gameplay.\n\nControls are simple and easy to familiarize yourself with. I strongly recommend playing with a controller - especially if you are doing local multiplayer. The tutorial is quick and very helpful in showing you all the game mechanics. The learning curve is mostly minimal, however, mastering the game and understanding each map takes some time. Maintaining momentum is critical to success, and practice will really help you understand the most efficient way to traverse through each map (ex: knowing when to jump vs. double-jump to get across a section). Whenever I play with my friends, we like to start from the first map and play through all the available ones (they are ranked in ascending order of difficulty).\n\nGameplay really shines if you can play (local or online) with a few friends - this is my top local multiplayer game at the moment of writing this review. As you race, the screen gradually shrinks toward the middle, and touching the red edges (usually happens if you are trailing behind) will cause you to explode and be knocked out. Interestingly, there have been rare moments where being in the lead too much has caused me to die (but I think it's because I touched the "ceiling" before the lagging players could be knocked out. 4 players can play at a time, and the round ends whenever only one player remains - the first to 3 points wins the map. Whenever a round ends, all players will respawn in the immediate area (this can cause hilarious situations if the starting point is somewhere very inconvenient - like a multiple wall-jumping area). My friends and I have gotten the screen to shrink into an extremely tiny square in the middle (we don't know if there is an upper limit for how small the screen can get) before someone won.\n\nThroughout the map, there are hazards like spikes/lasers (they will stun you for a few crucial seconds), boxes (usually a set of them in a row), and drops (insta-death). Boxes respawn, and a common technique is to let someone take the lead initially if you are unfamiliar with the map - especially since momentum can cause you to hit multiple boxes if you aren't fast enough in recovering. Usually, there are switches throughout the map that allow the person in the lead to manipulate the field a bit. For example, triggering a switch (you just need to run over it) may cause a route to be blocked off, opening a new one for the people behind you that is longer/more difficult. Sometimes, however, it is a better idea to avoid the switch, as they may also open routes that act as shortcuts for people lagging behind.\n\nThere are also items you can pick up, and this is my favorite part of the game - I am an item ♥♥♥♥♥, and will purposely go for items just to see what I randomly get. Pickups may be things like homing rockets, a set of boxes you can drop, a pulling hook (switched places between you and the person in the lead), or a freezing beam. I do not know if this is a bug, but something I've encountered is a delay when you use the ice beam right before a round ends - instead of having the item wasted, it seems to activate right after the next round starts, freezing anyone in front of you.\n\nThere are white areas on the ceilings that allow you to use your grappling hook to swing around. Some advanced techniques include swinging to propel yourself up a wall-jumping area and swinging to redirect your forward momentum (in the right direction). Boost areas also litter the map, and using a boost will make your character move considerably faster. Your boost gauge carries over even after death, so one technique I use it to save my boost for an ideal situation (ex: don't waste it if I am extremely far behind).\n\nAll of the DLC's are for purely cosmetic - there are no differences between characters except for the movement animations. From what I've experienced, the online multiplayer community is both active and friendly.\n\nOverall, the game is fantastic for anyone who enjoys comedic, fun racing. It is currently a steam daily deal, and this price is honestly a steal - even if you were to treat it as a finished product with no future developer support.\n\nStrongly recommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews","February 4, 2015","true","6.7"," 34 of 38 people (89%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","89","34","38","17","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dons20/recommended/207140/","dons20","TRU±PlayMaker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dons20/","569 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIntroductionSpeedrunners is a brilliant, 2d, sidescrolling, racing game where you race against up to 3 players, locally or online in a battle of speed and wits. I used to dislike this game, until very recently when it was much less buggy and I got to understand the mechanics of the game. It is early-access, but a very good one at that. Continue reading, to learn more.\n\nGameplayYour goal in speedunners, is essentially to win the race. However, there aren't any laps, nor are there any special objectives. Instead, all of you have to do is be so far ahead of the rest of the racers, that they vanish off the screen. The race screen follows the leader, so it is key to stay close to the leader in order to stay alive. Once the opposing racers have hit the bounds of the screen, you as the leader win a round. Winning 3 rounds makes you the overall winner of the race. Sounds fairly easy? Well it would be, if this game didn't have items or grappling hooks.\n\nThe grappling hook is one of the most useful and essential items in this game. It allows you to traverse terrain rapidly, or continue your momentum, which is key for this type of game. Any roof-like area with a white patch can be grappled at any time once your hook can hit it.\n\nItems complete this game, turning it from Need for Speed, to Mario Kart. A well timed shockwave can block enemy yellow grappling hooks, while an Invinci-Drill can bring a player from last place to the lead in a matter of seconds. The items give this game an important element of skill and timing. Wasting a valuable item can leave you open to attack from your opponents, and many times, it could be the last mistake you ever make as your opponent speeds his ways past you with a well timed grapple, into boost.\n\nThere are also unique stage elements which make the gameplay vary. There are usually multiple paths to get to a destination, Each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Some paths may have a boost charger, but may trigger a lever that opens a path with item pickups. If you're careful enough you can dodge these levers, but it's not always possible.\n\nMomentum is a key mechanic in this game, which seperates newbies from pros. Learning the levels, as well as timing your grapples, boosts and jumps are essential to going through an area at top speed and leaving all the competition behind.\n\nThere are many unlockables in the form of characters and outfits, as well as a rewarding levelling system. Fancy a more serious challenge? Head to ranked where the bravest challengers make their names known.\n\nVisualsThe visual style of this game is simplistic, yet effective. I especially love the visuals for super speed. The game really emphasizes the sense of speed you get after well timed jumps, grapples and boosts. However it's nothing mind-blowing, it's just neatly done.\n\nAudioI like the sounds in the game. The music is always upbeat and gives you a proper adrenaline rush especially in those clutch moments where you're neck and neck with your opponent.\n\nSummary & ConclusionSpeedrunners is turning out to be quite the impressive game. I normally don't recommend early-access games to people very quickly, however I must make an exception here, as right now this game has a lot already, and feels pretty well polished in all aspects.\n\nFor a highly competitive, super fun, racing and parkour game, Speedrunners is defintely worth playing.\n\n8/10 Worth buying\n9/10 With friends\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

Vantas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rikki_Nikki/","52 products in account","Alright, SpeedRunners is a fast-paced racing game that looks nothing like (and plays nothing like) a normal racing game. It blends elements from platformers and other genres seamlessly... kind of.\nThe game has a considerable amount of glitches and bugs, but it's been improved considerable since I first reviewed this game and it's a much closer to flawless.\nThere's a lot of glitches that I originally complained about, and I think the dev's edits and fixes to them has been phenomenol and deserves it's own mention. There's still a few issues, mostly with lag, but that's hardly a fixable issue due to poor ISP's and everything.\nThat being said, the game is still an amazing game. I would play this 24/7 if it didn't have it's road bumps (and, as you can see, I've still played it religiously). From what I've seen, the "Story" mode is mainly bug-free, and if you can't handle the lag from online players, you can always play with AI and friends in a custom lobby. There's a built-in  solution for every issue I have found, so in reality, by the end of this, a LOT of people might be saying "SpeedRunners is an amazing game and you're wrong!" and I'd agree, especially since it's much more tolerable than other games *cough* Monstrum *hacking*, and it runs at a very smooth framerate for a game of this size and quality (most games I can't play in a resolution above 800x600. This game I certainly can).\nFinally, I say buy this game for 3 main reasons: it has surpassed many MANY more games on the steam store, it's no longer Early Access, and it's an amazing game already. who wouldn't want to race their friends in a cartoon world of a guy in a unicorn suit, a cat, and a detective dog?

I try them and sure, they're fun, they get me hooked, but usually, after the first few hours (2 or 3 if I've made it that far into the game) i begin to get bored. This happens especially if the game is of a new genre to me. NOT THIS GAME. On average I play maybe... 3 or 4 hours of video games per week? I mention this to put the following into perspective... I bought this game, and precisely 48 hours after purchasing it, I already had 12.5 hours of gameplay in my record. This is the first time I've ever used the "HIGHLY ADDICTIVE" in any review for a game. I highly recommend it. It's fun, you can improve on how you play it, and the matchmaking is really sweet. You (generally) don't get stuck with amazingly good players. If you're in the US just dont play it during school hours (7am-1pm), you'll get matched to people outside your rank, and usually on the other side of the world, so the lag can be felt sometimes.","December 1, 2015","true","277.7"," 24 of 30 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","24","30","3","2"

As with all reviews, my opinion is not affected by this.\nSpeedRunners is a simple and fun multiplayer game that presents itself with frustrating matchmaking, but incredibly fun mechanics and well-designed maps!\n\nPros:Simple but complex mechanics and physics that all players can grasp and eventually master!\nLevels have a quantity = quality system where all of the levels perfectly adapt and use the mechanics.\nItems are fair and require a fair amount of strategy to properly use.\nLocal Multiplayer is always fantastic!\nDecent Workshop tools!\nRuns on lower-end software!\nNitpicks:The Ranking System is unfair and doesn’t count ranks by the number of wins/loses.\nThe music is decent, but there aren’t as many tracks, making it all sound repetitive.\nResolution should be configured at the start/before you open the game for the first time, because the window might be too large for you to adjust upon opening it.\nCons:Single-Player content is ultimately lackluster.\nMatchmaking needs considerable improvement, as it struggles to find players your rank easily and will end up matching you with higher-leveled people.\nThe Review\nSpeedRunners’ main hook is it’s emphasis on competitive skill. It emphasizes map memorization, a good understanding of the game’s momentum, and effectively using/dodging items in order to win. It stays as a comfortable party game while also being something that those seeking high-level play can pick up.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=662633875\n\nAnd this is what really makes SpeedRunners a really fun game to play. It’s mechanics are all well-built, with it being meticulously designed to be easy to pick-up but hard to master. Items can be used to get yourself an edge if you use it right, and the maps are designed so the multiple paths don’t always favor towards players picking the shortcut. The level design, while simple, is incredibly effective. And there’s a lot of these high-quality, well-designed maps in the game. It’s the case where Quantity = Quality.\n\nThe game’s mainly built on its multiplayer, which is definitely good fun. When playing with friends locally, it was a blast, and almost no issues were had with the game’s overall performance. Online Play is a bit unstable, but still playable. For some reason, getting matched up with players your own skill is incredibly difficult, and this is when you’re not being matched with players two leagues above you and literally playing from the other half of the continent. Unfortunately, the game’s matchmaking is quite problematic, although it’s nothing that they can’t fix over-time.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=662633774\n\nAnother problem I have with the game’s Ranked Play is it’s ranking system. It has the old Rocket League points system that I really hate where you’re almost eternally stuck to the bottom rank due to ranking up requiring such a high number of points.\n\nThe game’s single-player content is sorta just there. There’s a story mode that’s really uninteresting unless you want to unlock in-game comics, but the bots are fairly well-designed for single-player and you’ll be able to practice alone if you wish. It’s a OK offering for a mainly multiplayer-only experience.\n\nThe Custom Level Editor/Trail Editor are nice additions, and certainly help bring another side of the community together. For the most part, the tools presented are already good enough for players who want to design levels or make cosmetic trails, and this is apparent due to a lot of the Workshop maps being well-designed.\n\nThe game’s presentation is relatively decent. The art-style is nice, but the UI is a bit messy. The game’s soundtrack is repetitive due to it being only a handful of in-game tracks, but it’s definitely well-composed and invokes the excitement that comes to the game’s matches.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=662633811\n\nIt can run alright on lower-end hardware too, so you don’t have to break the bank to get it to work. However, I noticed considerable framedips on my lower-end laptop when playing it, and when the game got anywhere below 50 FPS, it was practically unplayable.\n\nFor the most part despite the technical issues I’ve had with SpeedRunners, I thoroughly enjoyed my time with the game. There’s some real potential for a brand new competitive e-sport, but on it’s own, it’s fantastic fun with friends. If only the Online Multiplayer wasn’t quite the mess.\n\nTL;DR - SpeedRunners is a well-designed game that’s sure to take a spot at LAN Parties, despite it’s bad matchmaking and minimal single-player content.\nFor more reviews on all sorts of games, follow  Lots' o Giveaway's group curations and reviews  here!","April 19","true","7.3"," 24 of 33 people (73%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","73","24","33","7","0"

Offering great fun on a couch with friends as well as a intense competitive experience.\n\nFull Video Review:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBxHPRFqPrc&ab_channel=GuyLogic\n\nTextual summary:\nThe summary can never compare to the full video, so i always recommend watching that for the best possible impression of the title.\n\nFirst things first: The game is a TON of fun, which is as always, the most important part of a game. The fast paced and hectic nature coupled with the various items that throw a curve ball at the players means that it's unpredictable and a great way to spend time with friends.\n\nOn the competitive side the various leagues are set up quite well and while the lower leagues might have some issues with smurfs, I've found them to be less of an issue than they appear. As with all competitive games, knowing the tracks and timing are often the most important part of a game and provide a barrier to entry to those new.\n\nThankfully, the game offers a variety of ways to practice from Bot and Solo runs as well as non-ranked mode quick matches. All in all the game provides quite a few tools outside of the ranked play to both learn as well as enjoy the game.\n\nOne criticism i have for the title is that it REALLY doesn't like you fiddling with alt-tab and options. while recording the review i experienced several crashes. Theses never occur during normal play, but it's still worth noting.\n\nOther than that i have nothing but the greatest of recommendations for this title.

You race either 3 other people or bots, depending on what you are doing, and gain points which go towards your rank and gain another set of points which goes towards your level. You have a couple of options when playing as you can play 'Ranked Match', 'Quick Match', 'Custom Match', 'Local Party' and finally 'Tutorial'.\n\nRanked Match - The only (As far as I'm aware) mode where you gain points which go towards your rank but if you lose the match you will lose points based on their rank, if you won any of the possible games and so on. In this you also gain points which go to your level. You will be put with players based on a similar rank as you and if that's not possible you will then be placed with people on a rank lower or higher than yours by one and if that's not available then it will go to two ranks. In this mode you will also have Lethal Spikes where the spikes automatically kill you (This and Custom are the only modes which have this though Custom CAN have this if the Wheel of fate lands on it)\n\nQuick Match - In this, you wont gain points which go towards your rank but you will gain points for your level. You have the same system when it comes to placing you with people. Other than that there isn't much to this mode, though this mode is good for training on some of the basic skills or learning the basic maps.\n\nCustom Match - It's pretty obvious what this mode is about, though in this mode you can invite your friends to play with you instead of random people, you can also have bots in it and you can set their level of difficulty which ranges from easy to hard. In this mode you can also set up a wheel of fate this will mod your game or the current match/map depending on what the wheel of fate lands on. The options are called 'SpeedRapture' 'SuperSpeed' 'SpeedHookers' 'srennuRdeepS' 'No Items' 'Lethal Spikes' 'RocketRunners'\n\nTutorial - You will play against bots who are set to the easy difficulty and along with that you will have text on the map which will tell you where to jump, slide, grapple and such.\n\nLocal Party - Never really used this so I'm not going to go into this one.\n\nAlso to add on, the wheel of fate has a chance of appearing in Quick Match and Ranked Match randomly. So i explained you the gamemodes other than one, so why did I recommend this game? Well, it has simple graphics, simple controls though they can take time to get used to (Recommended to not change them as it only gets complicated if you do and they are quite easy to get used to),  has some competitiveness though it depends on who you are playing with, and this game easily consumes time if you ever need to just waste your time away. Now I'm going to move onto the negatives of this game as I'm not gonna sugarcoat anything. Camera Angles, this is one of the most frustrating things especially on custom maps which I absolutely despise. You're in first running, but wait suddenly the camera angle glitches or changes and you can't see anything! What can you do? Blindly guess where the next grapple, powerup, boxes, spikes and ect are gonna be! As the camera usually focuses on the second player than the first which gives them a chance to catch up as you struggle to regain your speed. Another con of this game is the picking map system, you and two other players wanted Silo? Oh wait the fourth player picked Theme Park! SO we're going to play that!  This doesn't happen often but when it does, it's simply frustrating especially when the map they picked is one you hate. One of the big things is also not really the developers fault but it's the players. Say you got in a match and you start beating them there will be a guy or a girl who will get really mean and nasty to you, calling you noob, hacker, cheater and all sorts of things because they are mad that you are dominating. There is of course a mute button but do you really have time when you are mid way in a match? I don't think so.\n\nFor anyone interested the levels does nothing for you other than give you new characters or different themes of the characters and also some powerups or some of the fate of wheel things? I never really paid attention so i can't say. You start at level 6 which gives you all the basic characters and their themes and you make your way up to level 24 which is currently the highest and the character which you get at that is a golden Unic.\n","October 28, 2015","true","178.3"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","13","14","0","2"

It's definitely worth the friend rage. Also, the only issue I have right now would be the blast zone lines aren't transparent, which they should REALLY do.\n\nAnalysis:\n\nSpeedrunners is a game of running around a big map, grapple hooking your way to first place. Of course, it's only possible to grapple white ceilings, so the majority (unless allowed) of the map is going to be running, picking up item boxes, and trying to get to first place. What you have to do is make sure you keep on running til you can't. By that time you've hopefully won your first round. The game is in Early Access right now, but it's getting a lot better! The controls are also configurable and it's really best with a controller.\n\nThe items while not that plentiful are actually really fun regardless. You have rockets to shoot at people, EMP blasts to destroy: grapples, golden grapples, boxes, and also rockets; invincibility shield drill which protects you from harm, golden grapples which hook onto the closest player in the direction you face, and 3 boxes.\n\nSpeedrunners also has a nice twist to it where you can choose different modes to play. The most frustratingly fun has to be the mirrored track mode. Rapture just shoots rockets everywhere, lethal spikes, all X (X being either rockets or golden grapples last time I checked), and there may or may not be another I'm forgetting at the moment, but that's the fun of this game.\n\ntl;dr Speedrunners is a REALLY fun friend rage-inducing game that makes you want to keep trying to aim for the top, but also can be played casually enough for fun.\n\nI'd give this amazing Mario Kart-esque game a 9/10.","December 19, 2014","true","17.3"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

The thrill of being in first and the feeling that you can't be stopped by your opponents is just purely amazing and I think everyone needs to experience it.\n\nIn the story mode of SpeedRunners you play as Speedrunner and you try to become the best by overthrowing the other speedrunners.\n\nBut enough about the story, let's get into the gameplay:\nThe entire game is based on speed. You try to outrun all your opponents and the last one alive wins, win three times and you win the game.\n\nAnything goes, you can use weapons,grapling hooks, explosives and all sorts of stuff. Some stuff can backfire on you so be careful on how you use the power ups.\n\nThe Graphics are awesome and I love the art style. Everything from animations, backgrounds and characters, everything looks amazing.\n\nThe soundtrack at first, I liked, but it get's tiresome really fast and I just really prefer to either mute the game and put on something else or just don't wear headphones.\n\nThe main campaign took me 1 hour to finish, and there is some replay value. You can go through the campaign more than a few times and unlock more stuff like maps and characters.\n\nI didn't encounter any issues while running this game and I highly doubt anyone will too, so you are good to go.\n\nOverall I don't have anything bad to say about SpeedRunners. It's an amazing game and I highly suggest you check it out and you will get sucked into it.\n\nPros:\n+Great gameplay\n+Outstanding Art Style\n+Outstanding multiplayer\n\nCons:\n-Incredibly short campaign\n\nFinal Rating:\n9/10\n\nIf you liked this review, please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked about it.\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!\n","May 13","true","1.5"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","14","16","0","1"

The aim of the game is to outrun your opponents by forcing them to fall off-screen. There are also items, switches and a few other mechanics that assist in your run. There are various different maps to choose from, including a level editor that allows people to share and play custom levels.\n\nLet's start with the gameplay. SpeedRunners is very enjoyable to play, especially with a group of friends. You'll be racing each other for hours; running, dashing, sliding, grapling, and whatever you can do to retain your lead position. Although it is fun, the gameplay is a little bit repetitive with the same goal all the time. However, the level editor does nullify some of this repetitiveness, as well as the random wheel thing that rarely spawns and altars gameplay for that round.\n\nIn terms of graphics, this is the main area where the game is being let down the most. The textures themselves are a solid effort, but the particle systems are lacking a lot. The game could use some more particle effects to polish it. Yes, it is still in Beta, and polishing is usually left till last, but it is still valid for the current version. I do hope they improve this when the game is out of Beta.\n\nOverall, a solid effort still in the works. I hope to see something spectatular with this when it is out of Beta.

BUT THEN! I tried a match...against living people! That is right! I'm telling you right now I went into a match with other humans behind their own computer screens. yes sir. and It was the funnest ♥♥♥♥ I have ever experienced.

So you know this game is ♥♥♥♥ing excellent when I reach into my own torn up wallet, pull out my debit card, and buy a game for myself after only playing it a few hours.\nIf you're on the fence about buying this, get it. 10/10 would get cheek blasted by veteran players again.","October 2, 2015","true","12.9"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","79","15","19","7","7"

Gotta go fast like Sanic, right? Yep indeed you do!  It's a highly competitive game.\n\nIf you play with people that are much higher rank than you, just do it.  Don't rage.  You will learn the tricks quite a LOT faster than you would playing with people the same rank as you!  With enough practise, you'll be ace.\n\nYou may find that people say it's impossible to play with over 80 ping, but it IS possible!  You just need to time some things earlier & predict where they're going to be.\n\nRecent update made it harder to find lobbies (playing with 200 ping isn't that bad, come on).  It's when a ping is unstable which ruins the play.\n\nThis screenshot was taken when the US/UK/Europe people would still be awake.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=409195569\nChange the Download Region in Steam to get around this. Or add "+search_distance worldwide" to the launch options.\n\nFun fact about unstable pings:  The game is more likely to break, and can be quite hilarious sometimes.

Game also has weapons which can be used to mess up your opponents.\n\nSome gameplay tags: Very Fast-paced, High skill cap, simple mechanics, repetetive, addictive\n\nRecommended Audience (my opinion):\n1. Groups of friends looking for an easy game to pick up and have fun with (probably wont pass 30 hours gameplay if in this group)\n\n2. People who want a competetive multiplay platforming/racing experience\n\n3. Anyone (Seriously it's a damn good game, I'm far too lazy to write a review like this for most games :D\n\n\nPros:\nEasy to get into I highly recommend learning the game initially with friends who are also new to the game, the start of the game has alot of just learning maps and can be very rough unfortunately if you are not partnered with friends/other newbies, even a few hours could give someone a massively unfair advantage over a new player and hurt the experience for them.\nVery Fun\nFast Paced\nHigh Skill Cap\nLive Update: New content / bugfixes regularly implemented\nCustomisable graphics (Trails, characters and object mods)\nNot very resource intensive\nPro-active Developers  This is a very important point, the devs of this game are constantly looking for feedback and, while I might personally disagree with some of their choices and initiatives, I think they deserve massive praise for their approach to the development. They listen to the community and always try to look out both for the experienced players and the newer players.....I just happen not to be in sync with the community on several discussions hence the disagreements.\nStreaming and community content on front-page:  Not a big deal but just a nice touch, if you release a good video or guide you might be featured on the front page after the game opens and if you stream the game there is a tab which will show your league, your current viewers and give an easy link to your stream, just a nice little touch\n\nCons:\nHeavily repetetive:  It's basically a racing game with, imo, slightly mechanics and weapons, there's 35ish? tracks at the time of release that are curated or official and gameplay off of these is rare unless you personally go looking for it\nRanked System: (Due for an overhaul according to devs, will update this review if it is updated and improved)\nExtremely simple mechanics: This is both a pro and a con, on the one hand it makes the game much better for picking up and playing, on the other hand it often feels like levels are all played the same, the techniques used for speed rarely vary and weapons provide most the variety\nSpeed Cap: This won't affect your gameplay for a very long time after you start but if you go for long enough this becomes a big issue. You take routes or do tricks that should give more speed but still everyone ends up travelling the same speed making route variation pointless and suboptimal\n\nOther comments:\nSoundtrack is only ok, not necessarily a con but worth mentioning\n\nDoesn't handle latency amazingly well but vastly improved on this issue so no longer worthy of a con, I have no major issues even though I can't get wired net where I live.\n\nPlayer count is currently a bit low which prevents the implementation of certain gameplay refinements that I think the devs would like to put in but this shouldn't put you off buying the game, games are always available and community is (mostly) nice","December 26, 2014","true","099.7"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","75","15","20","4","4"

Easy to pick-up, quick tutorial, and will get you in a ranked match will players of your own skill level. This is done through a point system which is distributed by your position when only one person on the screen is left on the screen alive three times. Sounds easy and fun, right? Learning the controls and movements, sliding, bouncing off walls, grappling off ceilings. jumping are very easily learned. And Item knowledge comes at a very natural rate. The curve for player skill is impressive up until bronze, but that will be brought up later. Overall for, what I am calling, the first part the game is rather enjoyable with much motivation to continue to get better. And not to mention that you race against 3 other people. and you can set up various custom games and invite your friends to race along with you. Much fun, much merriment.\n\nWell geez, you're probably wondering, how is this a negative review when everything up until now has been so upbeat and balanced? That's just it, it's highschool and college roping you in with the concept of what their 'perfect' class should be. And we ALL know that it never is, and all you can do is pray that they don't do a complete 180 before you can change out of that class.\n\nBeginning of this game, great, fun, ignorant bliss. Get to bronze league and beyond, this game is a completely a different beast than the kitty you once knew. You'll see people that are at least 100 times better than you, and I can say this from personal experience. I bought a second account just to use as a smurf, so that I could train and be their equals and instead of coming in last place every game. But there are more bronze leaguers now so it may be a bit lighter than when I was first playing, but this leads to my next game killer.\n\nThe God-Abhorrent-Game killing-Making me uninstall this game 4 times due to frustation lag. Did you knock the person off the screen and they are still going? Did you get hooked, but you were sliding (negates hook)? Did you hit someone with the 'cheese ball' but it went right through them? Did you place boxes down, but the opponet went right through them as well? Did you grapple on a platform and were sent flying in the opposite direction instead? Can you not hold the lead because your opponet is sooooo off the screen that they should have lost for 20 seconds now?\n\nIf you have experienced any of these problems, you may be the victim of someone's (**Cough Lucas from Venmo/Pam Beesly looking directly at your laggy Butt**cough) lag. Call 1-800-Unresponsive Devs that will never fix these problems, quite literally. Why do you think I waited until I was silver league to review this game? So that my account/record would be sufficient enough so that it could withstand the straw man of "They're working on it, or just give it a little time, or it will be fixed in the next update." LOL XD, I joked about a possible theory that there were no true updates, and they just update bugs, and it seemed I was correct for the most part. Once R34 came out, that was when new  bugs were approaching!!! I noticed the opposite swing glitch, curl-up into ball glitch, and now a completely odd dead stop in air glitch on the map silo that wasn't even there before. I have given them plenty of time to address these bugs, and they have failed to give me any hope of restoration.\n\n(Not to mention of the 11 maps you can play in ranked SpeedRunners, 4 of them have been labeled as taboo by Bronze and upper classes for focusing on Randomly generated numbers=op items, and some that are just completely broken altogether. But no, let's change Theme Park again, k? K.)\n\nYou will find good pings up till expert league, but bronze is where it starts to get iffy. Did I mention that to get to Bronze you need 6000 points, and for winning a game the highest point amount you recieve for beating your own rank is 30?!! I'm sorry am I at Chuckie Cheese, or playing a speed parkour video game? In Silver is the worst it can get, and that is where I am currently stuck at, and the motivation for writing this piece. The amount of people with bad pings at this level overtakes the good 8-1, matches aint fun. Especially at that difficulty and the need for pinpoint precision.\n\nI don't want to keep dragging on like I have done now, but I want to make a closing statement. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNTIL A STATEMENT IS MADE REGARDING THIS GAME MOVING TO A SERVER. Oh did I forget to mention that too? My b. No server for your 10 bucks, p2p allllll the way. Hell, pardon my tongue, if you want to buy an outstanding title, get SHOVEL KNIGHT. 15 bucks, Retro throwback, no lag, original content for days, and amazing interactive gameplay.\n\nTLDR: This game is a poopy butt, does not get anywhere near close to a tenouttaten. I would rate it 7 asses and 5 guys outa ten. If you do not want to rage, torture yourself, or just generally like yourself DO NOT buy this game, ESPECIALLY early access.

This combined with its fast paced gameplay and short game length allows it to be played anywhere and anytime (i myself am guilty of sneaking it in and about while doing homework and assignments,"just 1 more match!") which can explain its overwhelmingly positive feedback even while it is still in 'Beta' development. Included with this gameplay is the intergration of the ranking system which involves the use of the leaderboard which tracks players in you league and how many points they have which allows the player to check their standings compared to others which allows for a competitive environment that increase the games longegevity and also seperates casual players to more serious ones.\n\nSpeed runners appearance is fit for all ages due to its bright and bold colour palette which distinguishes the background from the runners that the players control, giving the game a 'quirky' and fun feeling. Its availability comes from its low price of 10 dollars while not on sale and 2 dollars while on sale which is a cheap price compared to most other games in the market that usually range from 15 to 25 dollars. Speed runners is also a 'quick to pick-up' game letting players get into the game faster and also making it less daunting for newer players to the genre. This combined with its cheap price and colourful appearance sets this game up for long-term success due to its wide target market and the fact that cartoons are better than realism long-term due to realism always being outdated while cartoons itself are a unique and personalize genre of presentation.\n\nIts rank system involves the use of leagues which are different groups that players are placed in due to their skill. Its uses a point system which is the way you rank up to a higher league in Speed Runners in which points are earned according to you succes in matches. However you may ask how they balance out the points lost or gained if you in a match with higher ranked people? Speed Runners makes it so that if your vsing a higher ranked person, the points you lose in the match are decreased and if you vsing a lower rank person, the points you lose are increased. This, combined with the quick matches that speed runners offer makes the ranking environment, friendly and less daunting for any player.\n\nThere are the reasons why Speed Runners in my opinion is worthy of a 7/10 rating which can be improved through increased content, different styles of gameplay e.g. new gamemodes, perhaps a unique character customisation (might be going a bit too far xD) and general bug fixes which i strongly believe will be achieved when this game is out on full release (maybe not the character customization).","February 10, 2015","true","25.4"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

The game has you racing your opponents through many different stages and your goal is to off-screen the other players to get a point. If you get 3 points in a match then you win.\n\nSpeedrunners  has extremely fast-paced gameplay that is so god damn fun, and is a game you have to play with friends to get the full enjoyment out of it, like Super Mario Kart, Mario Party, Super Smash Bros, etc. The game is a 2D platformer, so I'm going to instantly recommend the use of a controller, because the keyboard is way too annoying to use.\n\nSpeedrunners  like many other party games, contains many different items that you can use to get the upperhand in a match. You get experience points from successfully using the items and you can level up to unlock more characters and skins for those characters.\n\nThe game  does have a somewhat lack-luster soundtrack. With it as a whole, getting extremely repetitive at times. To be honest this is a flaw, but most of the time you will not notice this if you are talking to friends over Skype and when  things get really intense.\n\nVisually  the game is very simplistic. There are solid colors throughout the whole game, but it actually adds to the charm of the game in my opinion and doesn't detract from the overall experience of the game. This actually makes Speedrunners a perfect game for low-end rigs, so that is always a plus.\n\nRUNNING AGAINST THE ONLY 3 FRIENDS YOU HAVE IN A SPEEDY WAY. 9.8/10","December 23, 2015","true","50.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

I first played during a free play weekend and was thrilled! So much fun! Then I got it in a Humble Bundle and the fun was already fading away.\n\nEven in the Entry League, players are very good and you have to know the levels very well to have a good chance. I made it twice into Beginner League, only to be demoted very soon after that. In almost every lobby there is someone who should be at least two leagues higher and wins the match with 3 wins and all others having zero. Balanced lobbies are very rare, I'd say one in twenty.\n\nAnd now that I started to know my way around the official levels, everyone is selecting workshop levels and the "fun" is starting all over again. The levels are so much harder and pure frustration for the "Beginner" I seem to be in this game.\n\nThis is my biggest problem with this game: The difficulty curve is so steep, you can barely get better. If you get matched with better players, which is very likely when you start playing this game, you have almost no chance to get to know the level. And if you don't want to spend multiple hours per day to learn the levels in private lobbies, you're lost.\n\nWhen I play 10 games per day, only one or two are fun. The rest is frustration either due to much better players in my lobby that don't leave me any chance or workshop levels that are so much more difficult than the already difficult official levels that I spend most of the time waiting for the next round.\n\nIt is a shame, because I really started to like this game. But it has changed so much that it became a source of frustration and anger, rather than enjoyment.\n\nP.S.: The community is basically the same. You do meet very nice people, helping you, explaining moves, levels, etc. But more often then that, you meet elitists that don't give a damn about you being a beginner and struggeling with the game.","April 12","false","20.7"," 26 of 43 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","26","43","0","4"

Well, my friend, then SpeedRunners is for you!\n\nBecause it’s all of those things wrapped into one really well made package.\n\nSpeedRunners is a racing game, first and foremost. The setup being that various superheroes are racing to the scene of a crime, or emergency, and trying to beat each other there! At least that’s what I got out of it, the game is light on story; but it honestly doesn’t need it, the gameplay is what shines here. And boy, let me tell you, it really shines. This game is polished. It’s incredibly smooth, responsive, and just feels good. Like peeling the plastic off of a new cellphone.\n\nAnd surprisingly, SpeedRunners is an Early Access game! It’s still in Beta! I continuously find myself being shocked at just how good this game handles. It feels like a full fledged release, and I give the developers, DoubleDutch Games, credit because SpeedRunners is fantastic. This is in part because of the wonderful ‘track’ designs present here. A good racing game is crippled if it doesn’t have fun courses, which SpeedRunners delivers on. There are twelve or so levels, and only two that I dislike. That’s a pretty successful margin.\n\nNow, unlike any other racing game I have played, SpeedRunners involves… running! Who would have thought, right?\n\nAnd despite being a foot race, SpeedRunners maintains an excellent sense of speed. Four players all running at breakneck speeds trying to usurp each other. Throwing missiles, freeze-rays, hooks, and crates left and right hoping to trip each other up. The highs are high, and the lows are looooow. Being in first place, getting hit by a missile, tumbling around and ending up in last place-- and then dead-- is jarring. You’ll get mad at your friends. But when you do it, it’s oh so sweet.\n\nEach race is an elimination race where each ‘lap’ continues on until only one runner remains. Other players are eliminated by advancing far enough ahead that the edge of the screen touches someone. Then they explode, are out of the race, and the screen’s border progressively closes in until it’s just a tiny rectangle big enough for two players. This requires you to memorize the tracks very well, because at that point you’re almost literally playing blind.\n\nIt gets real intense real fast.\n\nAs with most multiplayer games, SpeedRunners is best with friends. But the game also offers some really, really, good bots that actually offer a decent challenge. And it has a very active multiplayer! I’ve never not found a game, which is great… Although I have occasionally run into some particularly ♥♥♥♥♥♥-y people… But it is the internet so that’s to be expected.\n\nI beat another player using the hook, this game’s equivalent of the ‘blue shell’, and he promptly told me in all caps to leave the game and engage in sexual congress with myself. I called him out on this, and he told me I was being rude for using the item. I proceeded to handle this situation quite poorly. But that’s another story!\n\nInternet antics aside, SpeedRunners is fantastic and certainly one of my favorite games of 2015. Even if it came out in 2013. 2013’s 2015 racing game of the year.\n\nSpeedRunners is just a joy to play. Even alone. And for $15 it’s a total steal. There is tons of content in this game, with like a billion different Runners and like ten skins for each one. They also have workshop support so that the community can create levels… Sadly I have only played a few workshop levels that even come close to the amazing quality of the developer courses.\n\nI will wholeheartedly recommend SpeedRunners to anyone looking for a cool local co-op game. Or, hell, anyone looking for a competitive racing game.\n\nIt’s that good.\n\nSeriously, go buy it. These guys deserve the support.\n\nLike this review?

As other reviews put it, it's like Mario Kart on foot, with the powerup-induced laughs and frustrations that brings.  I think it's reasonably well paced, once you work your way up the brisk learning curve: deaths are annoying, but I almost never felt like it was unearned.  Good twitch gameplay.\n\nThe aesthetic of the game is fun too.  A good homage to lighter campy-style superhero cartoons, in visual and audio.\n\nIt's still in beta, so it can have its bugs from time to time, and they may tweak the balance at some point.

Don't get me wrong when I say I dislike some aspects of it..\n\nThe maps are innovative and require a lot of learning in order to be competetive. But learning the map and the game without friends playing with you in a custom game can be really hard when these semi-pro people just dunk you in few secs every time you queue in a non-custom game. Guess it can also be reviewed as a plus that its skill cap is really high. Almost rogue like, for some players.\n\nI might have over-exaggerated the 'pros' of the games you encounter solo, but the only way  I  truly enjoy this past the initial excitement (~1 hour in my case) is with real friends, not random people. Think it as a Super Smash Brawl game. Social fun is where this game is at.\n\nAs it is for the ranked system I can't say, it's not been available while I've been playing (during steam winter holiday sale 2014).\n\nI give it  4/5  ..for fulfilling the graphical and mechanic-wise aspect.  Having workshop availability where you can add your own created maps is also a plus increasing the amount of different maps available.\n\nOnly reason I'm deducting one point  (NOTE, things might change as game leaves early access) is for shortness and how quickly it becomes repetitive. I'm missing the lack of different game modes. But with friends at equal skill levels it's one of the most enjoyable experiences on steam. That is, until you get all the achievements and play it till boredom without anything new to experience.\nThen it's time to switch game, and that can't be blamed on the game.\n\nTotally worth the minimalistic sum of money I had to spend for this game. Also one of those exceptions, when it comes to buying early access games for me.\n\nThank you for your attention.","December 20, 2014","true","12.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","8","10","3","0"

It's kind of like a racing game - but the twist is that it's 2D, and you control people instead of cars, and you get to shoot rockets, get powerups, that kind of thing! It sounds simple but it takes a while to get the hang of it, and knowing the map gives you a huge advantage in outsmarting your opponents, just like a race track there are side lanes (that are tricky to get to but can send you zooming past other people).\n\nI'm comparing it to car racing to give people a better idea, but then again it feels different and is a refreshing game to play! I'm playing with a controller and love it, they're still updating things and smoothing out bugs that I still encounter once in a while (mostly with multiplayer connection) but since I got the game it's seen substantial improvement and I'm looking forward to its release!

SpeedRunners is a game that puts you in a foot race agasint two to four players.  This can range from CPU, Online And Local Players,  or if you're feeling risky adding them all into the mixture.  It gives you a range of characters to choose from and a DLC pack for all of you youtube gamer followers at a reasonable price.  Let's now talk gameplay.  Fast,  It's the only word to really describe it,  Yes that does sound overwhelming at first but that's what makes this game stand out.  You have to focus,  and it's not a button masher.  There are tips and tricks,  slides and more that you will need to look out for in order to make sure you are the last runner... running?  Upon that sometimes the normal levels can get a little bit boring,  but never worry as they have a workshop community where players and even you can make and submit your own levels and even download them to play in your game.  It never gets boring and is quite addictive.\n\n8/10. :)","October 22, 2015","true","8.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

It was half off in the summer sale so I said why not. I prefer this game over ACU, ArmA 3, and other games I spent 60 dollars on, and I only spent 5 dollars here. I highly recommend this game to those of you who are competitive yet spirited. It's not too much money relative to a lot of other games on Steam, and it's a fun game where you can meet other people. As you rise through the leagues and ranks you become to know and race a tighter group.

Quick matches are around five minutes in length, which is quite a refreshing break from the 45-90 minute games of CS:GO so many of us are intent on playing every day.\n\nWhile it is fun, fast-paced, and cheap, it DOES have its issues...  The main mechanic of the game is a steadily decreasing screen size which bottlenecks the players' view of the map, where any player that falls out of frame is immediately killed.  The major problem is that in maps that are more vertical than horizontal, the camera does not know who to follow.  Oftentimes, players that are lower faze out a higher player or vice versa, entirely out of luck.\n\nBesides this and a few other issues (random deaths when getting too far ahead of your opponents, stuck in walls, etc), the game holds its weight fairly well for such a cheap title.  They NEED to implement a Group Queue option for ranked and quick play, though.  This game is far more fun to play with friends, and finding them in Ranked is difficult - particularly when they're a few ranks lower than you.","April 19","true","18.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Hooray!\nAnd to sweeten the deal, owners of this game from Early Access automatically get No Time To Explain Remastered, if they don't already have it. :D\n\n=================================================================\nEDIT AS OF 6TH APRIL 2016I finally took a look back at this game due to it releasing out of Early Access 2 weeks from this edit, and I gotta say wow, they've really improved a lot since the last time I checked in (date in my edit below). There's new music (the old one was nice but repetitive after a while) and new sound effects, they've put the local party mode into the game, and there's going to be a story mode too!\n\nBut the thing that I was clamouring for the most in my initial review? It's FINALLY HERE!\n\nIf the game had any option for setting search parameters to half the world by default (or maybe even the whole world, since I never even saw that), that would be great.And indeed, to my joy, they did. They've now added the option to specify which region to search for matches. THANK YOU!\n\nAlso, the character trail shop is now live. I think this works particularly well - none of the trails, as far as I know, improve your character, and are mainly for cosmetic effect, so this isn't pay to win. Another nifty idea to generate more revenue after this game's been bundled quite a lot of times already. (But, as reported[tinybuild.com], it has helped to boost the online community so well.)\n\nI'll leave my old review as it was, just note that it is partially (with respect to the matchmaking) outdated. I have however increased my EA rating, and this only makes this game much easier for me to recommend now.\n\n=================================================================\nEDIT AS OF 19TH AUGUST 2015 After changing Steam's download region, a method which enabled me to find online multiplayer matches in another game, I was able to join a match nearly-instantaneously. A VERY odd workaround - I shouldn't have to do this to even begin with, but at least I was finally able to find matches.\n\n================================================================\nA fresh and vibrant concept that marries platforming and racing in an almost seamless manner.\n\nIt took me a while to really try SpeedRunners, and that was on a whim after watching several Youtubers and Twitch streamers play the game. It seemed like really great fun to play with some friends, and it proved to be as such.\n\nAnother gem published by tinyBuild games (wow, they're really starting to make a name for themselves in the world of publishing) and developed by DoubleDutch games (I checked, they are based in the Netherlands, hence their name...LOL), SpeedRunners tells the story of up to 4 superheroes all racing and sabotaging each other in order to get to crimes the fastest. (And yet, the funny thing is that every map is basically all the runners going in a loop without actually getting to a crime scene...)\n\nThe game does seem like it needs more polish, despite the great concept here at play. Once in a while I get the occasional game crash, sometimes I find (oddly) that the game doesn't respond to my controls, there are a few weird bugs here and there where I am eliminated from a round a lot earlier than expected...\n\n...but all these pale in comparison to the fact that online matchmaking for me is incredibly annoying and almost always fruitless. Being on the other side of the world as compared to most people doesn't really help, since the matchmaking starts from your continent, and only switches to half the world after an increase in 2 leagues. Seriously, how many leagues does this thing have? I actually searched up to 23 leagues in half the world once before I threw in the towel. I don't even know why I searched that high either - I'm a novice! If the game had any option for setting search parameters to half the world by default (or maybe even the whole world, since I never even saw that), that would be great. Refer to my edits at the top of this review.\n\nOtherwise, the core elements of this game are incredibly great. There are a wide variety of powerups to frustrate your opponents with and slow them down or pull them back. Not that many official maps but there is a theoretically infinite supply with in-built Steam Workshop support. If you can grab a few friends to play a few rounds of multiplayer, you're probably going to have a fun time. (Or you might end up becoming ex-friends with those friends. It can swing either way.)\n\nIf you don't have any friends to play with, and/or cannot be bothered to play online with other people, you can actually practice your skills using bots. There's also a single player "Origins" mode where you have to reach a goal within a certain amount of time. This has been replaced with a new story mode where you race bots. Very decent alternatives that are adequately able to account for any lack of real life hoomanz.\n\nNow if only they will do something about the matchmaking, I could probably play this for a lot more time yet.\n\nWhen to buy: The game has been bundled a few times; the cheapest it has gone is 75% off. Quite worth picking it up from these sources/at these prices, it's great. :)\n\n9.0/10\n\nLike indie games? Want to see how some games play before deciding whether to buy them? Like game giveaways?

Listening to feedback from players and critics, DoubleDutch Games have taken their time to improve the game by offering over twice as much content, an advanced leaderboards and matchmaking system and  a much-requested online multiplayer, allowing players to show off their grappling hook skills against friends and foes around the world.\n\nIn short, SpeedRunners is a 4 player competitive platformer with grappling hooks, power-ups, and interactive environments.

It raised my competitive spirit to an all-time high with the ranked online mode, which encourages you to beat other players of same skill, attain points, and rank up!

I have barely touched the time trial-esque singleplayer mode, though, only because the multiplayer is just so fun to play and so difficult to put down.

It combines repetitivity with creativity and simplicity (I won't ity much, I promise) in such a way that I keep returning.

However for such a simple concept this game has a fair bit of depth with many levels to play through. What's more is that there are many levels that have been created by the community that you can play through the steam workshop, and you can create your own level if you wish and submit it too. This is a great game for playing with friends, as it caters for a fun and casual experience if you wish, or as my group discovered hours into playing the game, a very quiet experience where everyones concentration levels are through the rooof trying to time each and every jump,slide, grapple, and powerup perfectly. There are also modifiers to the rules available so that you can choose what weapons are available in your game.\n\nThis game is a must buy as there are certainly many laughs to be had, and friendships to be destoyed (just like in mario kart) :D","May 17","true","5.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

There are 10 characters you can pick from so far, including a pink unicorn, a Soviet spaceman and a scout from a certain game (I'm looking at you, TF2).\n\nAs it is still in early access, more characters and stages are likely to appear.

Where can I start? Well this is one of the best games I played in 2013. The game is very simplistic but is very fun, addicting and challenging. The concept of the game is basically a 4-Player racing game. You basically have to outrun your friends. This game offers hours upon hours of fun gameplay. I have played it for quite some time and it is still very fun.

The use of power ups allows for even gameplay and has similarities to the Worms franchise, Mario Kart, and parkour related games.\n\nThe most fun thing in this game is to be able to grapple yourself around on those white edges, and double jumping. Or what about jumping up those dotted walls? There's a lot of fun little features that will make you fall in love with this game.\n\nWould like more personalised characters instead of the preset ones, or just more colour variables on the existing ones.\n\nBest played with friends!","August 21, 2014","true","325.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

So, lo dengan 3 orang lo berlomba lari menuju.... nope, tidak ada garis finish. Menariknya adalah ada buanya tantangan disetiap map, mulai dari duri, jurang, angin, dan sebagainya. Belum lagi kalau player lain memberikan roket, menarik lo, atau mengebom lo. Iya, ini semacam lomba lari tetapi juga survival.\n\nGrafik: Kartun sederhana. Bukan berarti sederhana lalu jelek. Justru game seperti ini sebaiknya memang pantas dengan grafik kartun yang sederhana. Tujuannya adalah agar bisa dimainkan disemua tipe PC. Walau pun begitu, Dev nya termasuk Dev yang rajin dan terus mengembangkan animasi dan berbagai macam bug yang ada di game.\n\nGameplay: ADDICTED! Serius game ini itu bener bener dibuat untuk main bareng dengan temen lo. Bayangin lo dan 3 orang temen lo saling tarik menarik, saling membuang roket, atau saling meledakan bom sambil berlari menuju lingkarang yang gak ada batasnya. Eh siapa bilang gampang? Justru dalam waktu kurang dari 1 menit lo tau tau berada dipaling belakang, keluar dari 'layar' dan akhirnya kalah. Game ini mungkin waktu pertama kali agak susah untuk dimainkan, tapi semakin lama lo memainkan, lo semakin teradaptasi dengan map nya, senjatanya, turbo, dan berbagai macam rintangan lain.\n\nStoryline: Biasa aja. Story line disini menurut gue bagaikan practice ground. Jadi sebelum lo head-to-head dengan teman lo, ada baiknya lo memainkan story line sendiri agar 'lenjeh' dengan gerakan gerakan yang ada didalam game.\n\nGue berani kasih skor 9 dari 10.\nKenapa? karena developernya rajin update, gameplaynya addictive, grafiknya sederhana tapi menarik, dan terdapat steamwork sehingga lo gak bosan untuk memainkannya lagi dan lagi.","January 16, 2014","true","26.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","6","9","2","0"

The best part of the game is that no matter how much you play or how good you get at the game it will always be a challenge and will always force you do adapt and play better than everyone else.

The game itself is simple, but trying to master it is another question. I've played just over 260 hours, which is a fair amount of time I assume, and have found that the game has developed amazinly since 2014 and quite frankly I am shocked how many people now play it. Whether it be through youtubers or humble bundle the SpeedRunners developers are very friendly. From hosting tournaments where the winner gets special perks in-game to creating a level designer to the game which adds so much more depth to the game.\nThis game will always be one of those games where I go "Gosh, don't you remember SpeedRunners. What a great game."\n\nI love this game and will keep playing for a long time.","February 26","true","383.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I've played it for about 4.3 hours in about one day. It's essentially a running, 2D platformer with Mario Kart-like elements (one where you use a missile that homes on the lead player, similar to the dreaded Spiny Shell!). I'm a Mario Kart fan and a Mario platformer fan, so a hybrid of my two favorite games is a big delight. Despite its simplicity and how easy it is to pick up, there's plenty of strategy behind this, especially concerning item use, as all items have their own perks and strategies. The only downside personally is that I'm required to play online to unlock some characters and costumes, as it stops leveling up after a certain point, and I don't like playing with randoms online. I played offline with my twin, and we had a total blast with the game. Hopefully, mods will get bigger with the game, as it's also fairly easy to mod some aspects of it, including the music.","November 13, 2015","true","4.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Destroying your friends has never been more satisfying. Also has a friendly community, (not at all toxic) which is a nice change from LoL. With its' full release the game has never been in a better state and I love all the new features it has brought to the table. Would recommend this game to anyone even if this isn't near their taste of gaming. Also all of the workshop content that users make keeps the game very fresh because original maps can get old eventually. Personal rating has to be 9/10 for its' amount of fresh content, trail making, fair pricing, the amount of fun with friends, and replay-ability the game has. (Speedrunners 2, please?!?)

This is an excellent party game if you have friends over.\n\nThe mechanics seem simple at first, but as you play through the game you'll realize that they are all intertwined in such a way that you can play in ways unimaginable to your newbie self.  You constantly encounter people who have mastered aspects of the game that you weren't even aware of.  There is virtually no limit to how good you can get.  The gameplay is a nonstop adrenaline rush as you vie to dominate the poor saps (or the no-lifer!) who got matched with you.\n\nKnowing what I know now, I would gladly pay 10x the price for access to this experience.

Just like in Mount Your Friends, if it wasn't by the hanging dongs and the nude characters, the game would be totally focused on the competitiviness it has, while in SpeedRunners, the game has a gayish character with a pink unicorn costume, and another character with a big red ball head with a star on it, symbolizing the comunism.\n\nThe game has a nice plot, by first sight, since it involves all of an hero world where you need to save scientists from bombs.\n\n93/100","March 28, 2015","true","8.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

It's a very unique game as it combines three quite different genres -  racing, platforming and grappling (if that counts). It is playable in single-player with its campaign and the option to play against the CPU but it's definitely more enjoyable playing with friends. With its DLC, you can even play as famous YouTubers such as PewDiePie and Markiplier. There are also a wide variety of maps and modifiers to choose from to spice things up. In addition, the Steam Workshop allows players to race on heaps of community-created stages or even create your own. Overall, it's a great, competitive game that you can play with friends.","November 17, 2014","true","32.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Though I haven't had the chance to play a lot, I noticed a variety of music tracks got added, and the game hasn't crashed since. The only issue I still have with the game is the fact that it can at times be hard to find a match, especially during off-hours. Hopefully this will improve in the future. Other than that, it's still a great game.\n\nPositive:\n\n-a lot of fun, and fairly original gameplay\n-a lot of variety in characters, though this doesn't really affect gameplay (which I suppose is yet another good thing)\n-the game seems quite polished in the sense that most things seem to work as intended, and there are a lot of things that make you go 'oh yeah, good idea' while playing (though, of course, I can't think of any now)\n-multiplayer works rather well, though it can take a minute to find a game, which I'm guessing will improve as the player base grows\n-ranked matches\n-pretty cool community so far. Seen some rage quits, but no proper moaning/swearing as of now\n-community made content (just maps as far as I can tell, but who knows)\n\nNegave:\n\n-the game occasionally crashes for me (haven't yet looked up whether more people have this, but I'm guessing they do). This doesn't happen frequently enough to be a major issue, as restarting and loading the game doesn't take much, but it still sucks when you happen to be in a ranked match or with a nice bunch of people\n-the music gets rather repetitive, which isn't that big a deal. It would be nice if the music selection had some more variety at some point\n\nAll considered, I'd really recommend it to anyone who enjoys the idea of a side-scrolling racer (runner...) which had me actually laughing out loud at times.","August 17, 2015","true","37.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","1"

Also unlike mario karts, items are not the largest part about it. There are 4 things that make you go fast 1: those boats that give you boost which you can use at any time 2: the bubbles that are in some parts of levels 3: If you have alot of velocity downward and you grapple you get alot of horizontal velocity 4: Same applies with number 3 but with slopes(stairs included) that are in the level.\n\n3 & 4 is where I say that high-skilled players are separated from the low-skill that makes it unlike mario karts. Because most people who are new to the game don't know this(you should probably add it somewhere in the tutorial devs, or choose a different level that demonstrates these 2 well).  Anyways, these 2 important mechanics are what most of the useful tricks in speedrunners are basically derived from, it basicallys makes up the speed in speedrunners. Its these 2 mechanics that make it fairly different from mario kart, because in mario kart, without the items its basically who knows the map's parts and who's learned which kart is best to use and how to do the turns well(which isn't very in depth).\n\n\nThat's what I wanted to say about how this game is not mario karts. This game is extremely fun and very competitive. I've been playing it for at least a few hours every day. I've put 229.5 hours into this game, just the last 2 weeks I've put 21.9 hours(which is more than what other people writing these reviews as of now have even ever played).\n\nSometimes speedrunners is buggy, and perhaps it could use some more maps, but this game is top-notch, no doubt about it.\n\nthe characters also amuse me. 10/10.","January 25, 2015","true","247.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/207140/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nA good concept with decent game play. I don't think it's worth it's stated price but it's still in early access. Time will only tell! My hope is that they add some mini-game functions or attempt to play with the rules of the game. (This game is local co-op)!\n\nSpeed Runners is a game about running the fastest, being first while leaving your enemies in the dust. By being last, you risk the chance of being eliminated by being off the edge of the screen. The gameplay itself for the moment is decently good but has a lot -First player controls the pace and controls the camera. Take the long route or risk grabbing a pick-up may cost you a life. The scoring system as of current requires three wins. This means you need to win three times in order to take the game. You do not need to win consecutively to win the game. There are about a handful of characters to choose from at the moment. Some characters are available to unlock while others are DLC's. All character designs are quite unique and all move differently from one another. I haven't noticed any significant diversity in speed between the characters.\n\nMore or less, all characters seem to jump just as high as one another and move as fast as one another. Is this a good thing? Depends. It offers a level playing field for everyone but mixing up the game is never a bad idea. One person may prefer speed while another may prefer brawn. The only issue I have so far is that players are not able to melee or hit one another without a power up. Sure, this may be good as people aren't whacking one another always but some players I have played with mentioned that a melee addition would make it more engaging. Nonetheless, the game is still enjoyable and power ups provide a great addition to the game. Some of the power ups included are a grappling hook to grab the nearest opponent that pulls them back and you forward, boxes that opponents can run into, a force ball that completely slows and pushes opponents and a homing rocket missile (just to name a few).\n\nLevels themselves are quite challenging and take a bit of time to get used to and really good at. It is a bit overwhelming at first playing online and getting completely smoked by veteran players. If one's really persistent on getting good, it does take a little grinding to familiarize yourself with the level design. Visuals are quite simple and suit the games needs. It's not over the edge 3D but the graphics do fit the atmosphere. I wouldn't mind seeing a little more done in regards to animations or things happening in the background. Heck, why not have players influence some of the backgrounds/graphics. Why not even have them alter the stage? This is possible to a certain extent as levers are present throughout levels. These levers open and close paths and definitely add some more interest to the game. Sounds are pretty decent at this point and aren't extremely varied character to character. Dialogue is slightly different but wouldn't hurt to add a few more sounds to the voices.\n\nOverall, not a bad game in it's current form. There is a lot of opportunity here to take the game beyond being a simple linear running game. Although be it so, there's some serious fun to have online or between your buddies. I'm really, really, really hoping they add some mini-games or some more diversity into the game. They got a nice engine, let's do more with it!\n\nIndie Rating : 7.6/10\n\nRATING : 6.95/10\n\n\nPS - Why can't you take in-game screenshots with F12?","March 22","true","2.0"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

Some pros and cons:\n\nPROS:\n- Good Game Mechanic;\n- Fun gameplay;\n- Balanced powerup gameplay;\n- Workshop support (infinite levels);\n\nCONS:\n- Lobby has some issues (ranked matches with custom maps, no kick option, some game-crashing bugs)\n- Custom maps easily exploitable;\n- Ranking system is not the best, and not 100% balanced;\n- Game is filled with bugs.\n\nOverall, a good experience, but it might outerweight to the negative side very easily.\nSince it's a UNDER DEVELOPMENT, I'll keep a watch out, and I hope they fix all the bugs and balance out the minor tweaks.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Knolz/recommended/207140/","Knolz","Clamps","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Knolz/","98 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSpeedRunners is a competitive racing game that is undeniably fun to play! The game is in beta at the time of this review, so I will note that there are bugs that exist in the game; these bugs are not game-breaking but you may find yourself a bit confused at times as to what's happening. The game has a very straightforward control system that can easily be learned. The learning curve to the game is relatively low, just about anyone can play it and have fun. One thing I was really impressed with, were the animations for the characters in SpeedRunners. There was a lot of detail put into every frame for the actors in the game. The stage design may be my only gripe with the game. I think all of the stages are fantastic, but there are some awkward placements of traps in the game that will make you question the purpose of its location. SpeedRunners doesnt have much of a story mode, its multiplayer aspect is where the game shines. So if you're looking for a game to play with a group of friends for some friendly trash-talking fun, I'd suggest buying SpeedRunners!","June 13, 2014","true","31.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's not very accurate I know, but it's basically like if you touch the edge of the screen in last place you die and if you touch the edge of the screen in first (while running the right way) you'll win the match. There's also items you pick up, kind of like mario kart I suppose, but actually dodgeable (for the most part)\n\nThere is a single player mode, but its really really meh and I don't think the game is meant for single player at all anyway so don't buy it unless you have friends to play with or don't mind randoms online. Even for early access I think the game is certainly worth it and really fun. There's lost of custom levels to mess with too and at least a good handful of them are decent and fun enough.\n\nIt's a pretty cool game and I haven't seen a concept like it before so I found it really interesting.

These can all be used brilliantly to mess up your opponents (or occasionally yourself if you're unfortunate).\nThere's also your typical boosts, and the excellent grappling hook to help even the odds when you're falling behind, which adds even more to the fun.\n\nThe graphics are simplistic but fitting. It's well animated, and has a very clean look. The downside is, when someone is far behind, the screen zooms out and makes it somewhat hard to see, or when the match has lasted for a great amount of time, it can be a bit difficult to see what's ahead as the screen closes in. However, this isn't a huge detriment.\n\nThe audio sounds good and fitting, except the music is very repetitious. There's only one song while racing, and while it's catchy, it does grow old after a while.\n\nThe vanilla stages are well designed, and have well placed shortcuts and traps, and have a very well placed risk-versus-reward-style layout for each one. The Workshop also provides random stages, which have varying levels of quality (naturally).\n\nSimply put, this game has a few flaws, but it's a blast, especially with a group of friends. It's a perfect example of a party game.","January 30, 2015","true","10.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It takes a little bit to get used to. It has great music, funny characters, and DLC to play as some of your favorite YouTubers! It is a great game to play with your friends, including a build feature to make your own maps to try out! I think the people at DoubleDutch are doing a very great job on this game! By the way, it ends friendships! I recommend this to anyone that likes competitive multiplayer and can handle the intensity this game holds.

The goal? Race ahead of other players using items, speedboosts, and grappling hooks until one by one your opponents fall behind, touch the edge of the screen, and die.\n\nThis game is a blast both local and online, and run pretty smoothly for the most part. I do occasionally run into weird bugs where the game will randomly kill everyone, refuse to kill someone, or follow someone other than the leader, but it's never much of a problem.\n\nThe single player time-trial-like mode isn't that great, but you'll probably have too much fun in the multiplayer to notice. There aren't as many items as a Mario Kart game, but most of them are pretty cool: a hook to latch on to a player in front, a bomb that can be remotely detonated, a homing missile, a drill to speed you up and make you invincible, and crates to block incoming missiles and hooks or to trip up opponents. The stages are also great, featuring hard to reach shortcuts and alternate paths that can be closed off. Also, I have to say, once you master the grappling hook, getting around the stages feels so good.","September 29, 2014","true","27.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Think 'Mario Kart if it was a platformer' or 'Smash Bros if it was a racing game'. The gameplay is super addictive once you get a handle on the controls (supposedly it's easier with a gamepad/controller, but I like the keyboard controls fine), and the community is pretty nice for the most part. My advice for new players would be to try out the origins mode in addition to the tutorial: it allows for instruction/practice on individual game mechanics as well giving some backstory on the game (even if it's pretty basic).\n\nThe workshop is super cool too. It's really interesting getting to see the creative and challenging level designs made by other players.","March 14, 2015","true","11.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Just because during the ranked matches, i prefer to stick to the maps i know well (the official ones), and replaying them can get a little bit boring. not complaining though, just a thought :)\n\nthe only two things i think need fixing are the few bugs in the game. sometimes the camera is set completely away from all players- this can go on till the game ends, or just for one or two rounds. Rarely happens, but can get quite annoying when playing in ranked matches. Also, happening once or twice, my player randomly flew off the screen, causing me to die.\nThe other thing, which is a lot less of a problem, is upon opening the game, the window is opened half on-half off my screen. Not sure if i'm the only one, but it's happened on both of my computers.\n\noverall great game, you should deffinitely have a play of this when you can!","November 3, 2014","true","83.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Is one of the best game ever. Is like, playing an old game, but, multiplayer, online, and competitive, is like... I don't know, play Mario or Megaman with a friend who is in another country, but both are competing who beat the level faster. Let's make it clear, you don't shoot, you dont jump in enemies, you just run and throw items and usea some kind of nitro, but it have that old retro controller just like Super Meat Boy. I'm happy with this game and I know is gonna be free when it will be released, but, you have to pay for it, trust me (and of course, when the game goes free you will not have multiplayer online ♥♥♥♥).\n9.9/10\n(There is no 10 points game never in my life)","May 2, 2014","true","4.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Clutch through the various maps, dodge spikes and  plan out stratergy to take the people out of competition. I love the game before and after the update even more.\n\n>>Description<<\nSpeedrunners is a game where you need you need to move your pace up with hooks and take shortcuts to be in the lead. Use your weaponry pack to take out the other participants and shoot them off the screen only to win. Level up through different leagues to unlock Manly, and weird characters which would suprise you and perhaps get into using it yourself.\n\n>>Positive<<\nThis game has provided less lag free gaming and the bots in the game are quite smart to play with. Plus you can increase your XP through them to get more awesome characters. Adding to that, The smoothness compared to the past is quite noticable and vivid too.\n\n>>Negativity<<\nThe game does not have many negative points. It takes quite a long time to get into an online server. (Basically for me to get an Online game or ranked game, It would scan half the world to join a game). I wish they would make a "Room Collection" thingy so people can make room and people or friends can join in. Or just a Random server can be chosen with a low ping can be joined in. The new characters needs to smoothen out like the old characters.\n\n>>Improvement<<\nNeeds more Maps which are suitable to Bots, Increasing variety of fun and joy. Another powerup they can add would be like ALL STARS. Which can give different heroes a powerup which can states them different from each other.\n\n>>Rating<<\n4/5","June 25, 2015","true","34.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Think 'Mario Kart if it was a platformer' or 'Smash Bros if it was a racing game'. The gameplay is super addictive once you get a handle on the controls (supposedly it's easier with a gamepad/controller, but I like the keyboard controls fine), and the community is pretty nice for the most part. My advice for new players would be to try out the origins mode in addition to the tutorial: it allows for instruction/practice on individual game mechanics as well giving some backstory on the game (even if it's pretty basic).\n\nThe workshop is super cool too. It's really interesting getting to see the creative and challenging level designs made by other players.","March 14, 2015","true","11.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can only win by knocking your opponents out of bounds on the map, otherwise you just do laps until the first player dies, after this the playable area on the map will slowly shrink until there is only one player remaining.\n\nThere are a large amount of playable characters, and even secret bonus characters like the payday crew, goat from goat simulator, or even a potato, just a potato.  Couple the unlockable characters with the unlockable colour schemes and you have huge variety. It even gets better with user created maps! There is a lot of fun to be had in Speedrunners.\n\nOverall I enjoyed my time with Speedrunners over the free weekend and would recommend it to a variety of people, indie fans, racing fans, anyone who is a fan of fast paced sidescrollers.","October 3, 2015","true","8.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There should be this kind of "speed ability" that if you go fast enough you get to activate this special unique ability that your character has.What the special abilities are I'll leave the developers to figure that out.The game now though I still recommend though it's a killer when you first start playing.The controls are good it's just that many people are used to pressing the up arrow key to jump that when you force them to press z to jump they just get smacked in the face and basically run into every box when they begin.","October 24, 2015","true","35.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The premise is simple, don't get left behind and be the last left running to win.

Kinda depends on your skill, and how much of a ♥♥♥♥ you are willing to be. Not for those that can't handle losing well. That aside, you can always learn from other players the best methods to apply to guarantee a win.\n\nAlways a good equalizer, in case your group gets too good at this game, toss in a workshop map. Some are buggy enough, or well-designed enough, or brand new enough, that the utter lack of familiarity will re-balance the odds between skilled and unskilled (One of the best has to be Zero Skill, for it's simplicity, and utter insanity; especially with lethal spikes in play). Personally, I prefer to not see skill levels (SEE: Ranked Matches and their ranking system), and just take it up to chance, potential luck, and my adaptive abilities overall. It makes winning less of a bother, especially if I fall into a losing streak; plus, even the mighty have their times of bad luck, and relatively new players can profit off that and catch up.\n\nBut to be honest, this game reminds me of the classic days of gaming on the consoles with my siblings with games like Super Bomberman and such. Overall, it's probably a good thing we're separated by a distance only the internet can keep us playing against each other with. I would be hit a ton of times for the many cheap shots I've used.","February 4, 2015","true","118.1"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

The music is excellent and uplifting, yet I'd prefer at least 10 more tracks to the overall package.\nRight now, the design, personally, it feels more of a potpourri of singular good choices, that however don't really want to fit together as a whole:\n\n-> The stage design is very "clean" and sterile of some sort, yet the characters and overall design is aimed to be quirky?\n-> The music ranges from upbeat funk to Ska (please add more ;D!) and fits the quirky design, yet clashes with the sterile stage design, and even with some meaner looking characters\n-> the red "borders" when one player died are just ugly to look at - how about some fire animation of some sort, to actually "see" the danger?\n-> character design is highly (!) uneven in quality and "charme"\n-> German translation is amateurish. It seems like somebody posted the stuff on google translate. And I'm not even kidding. English wordplay and puns are translated 1:1 and is REALLY wonky in german.\n-> I'd like to see instant emoticons or "taunts" in gameplay.

There should be this kind of "speed ability" that if you go fast enough you get to activate this special unique ability that your character has.What the special abilities are I'll leave the developers to figure that out.The game now though I still recommend though it's a killer when you first start playing.The controls are good it's just that many people are used to pressing the up arrow key to jump that when you force them to press z to jump they just get smacked in the face and basically run into every box when they begin.","October 24, 2015","true","35.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I love it. Made some custom maps (which aren't GREAT, but demonstrate my appreciation for the game) Imagine Mario Kart, but without split screens. You get power-ups and momentum from swinging around with your hook (45 degree angle, keep that in mind if you intend to play) and the point is to stay in the screen, and eventually ahead of your opponents (up to 4 player matches). When you move out of the screen, your OUT for that round.\n\nThe downside is that it is in Beta (hence the early access thingy). So expect frequent reload from your desktop. Ignore if it isn't in early acess anymore. Also, for now, there is no league and so you will sometimes face very skilled opponent who won't give you any chances at all (unlike me; i will wait for you and show you the good path for a "speedy run" if you are new to the game). Also the music is not really varied as of now, febuary 2014 (only one track for all the stages... enjoyable at first.. but you might want to drop the music down and use your own playlist after a couple of hours.)\n\nBut, again, this is a really enjoyable, very competitive racing game and you can play local co-op or online co-op or even a mix of both!\n>I would also recommend that you use a controller if you want to be the best, but then again I havn't really tried on mouse/keyboard\n\nPlease forgive my poor english","February 27, 2014","true","91.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I keep saying "Just one more round" and then 10 rounds later i show no signs of stopping!\n\nIf you watch the videos the game looks hard and complicated, but it's really pick-up-and-play. Granted a lot of skill will seperate the average player form the masters, but everyone can have fun with this. It's wild and crazy platforming action.

You can only win by knocking your opponents out of bounds on the map, otherwise you just do laps until the first player dies, after this the playable area on the map will slowly shrink until there is only one player remaining.\n\nThere are a large amount of playable characters, and even secret bonus characters like the payday crew, goat from goat simulator, or even a potato, just a potato.  Couple the unlockable characters with the unlockable colour schemes and you have huge variety. It even gets better with user created maps! There is a lot of fun to be had in Speedrunners.\n\nOverall I enjoyed my time with Speedrunners over the free weekend and would recommend it to a variety of people, indie fans, racing fans, anyone who is a fan of fast paced sidescrollers.","October 3, 2015","true","8.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is the only reason that makes this game weak. It should have generated levels like in payday where you can find different keycard locations. That would make this game the bomb.","October 27, 2015","true","5.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The whole point is to not fall behind when racing other Online players. The controls are very simple too: Z is jump X is grappling hook,C is use power up. There are around 7-10 different characters and they're all great! The game is very big for multiplayer and is a very good game too play with your friends cause it gets very competive. I would suggest it to anyone who loves online competitive racing!","December 12, 2014","true","13.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The many options in which you can play the game makes it very flexible to enjoy it in several ways even when the game in itself is limited in variations in gameplay. Ranked games are great as they let you face opponents close to your skills and compete for rank points (rage quits aplenty ha).\nOnly reason you will sometimes just hate the game is when you get beaten once and again. But there is always another opportunity.\nOne suggestion I would make (even when it doesn't apply to me) is that I believe that High Ranking matches should have no powerups/items. I believe that in higher levels these spoil the game a little.","April 5","true","74.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The many options in which you can play the game makes it very flexible to enjoy it in several ways even when the game in itself is limited in variations in gameplay. Ranked games are great as they let you face opponents close to your skills and compete for rank points (rage quits aplenty ha).\nOnly reason you will sometimes just hate the game is when you get beaten once and again. But there is always another opportunity.\nOne suggestion I would make (even when it doesn't apply to me) is that I believe that High Ranking matches should have no powerups/items. I believe that in higher levels these spoil the game a little.","April 5","true","74.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The idea is simplistic, 2d side scroller racing game, yet it has provided my friends and I hours of entertainment. It's great for LAN parties, where you can hear your friend rage at getting blown off the map by a bomb you set or being caught by your golden hook.\n\nThe good:\n- Fun, fast paced gameplay\n- Well balanced items. None of the items seems overpowered and there is a way to dodge most of them if youre quick.\n- Wall jumping is well implemented and very smooth.\n- Grappling hook is fun.\n- Workshop level editor and the ability to play user created levels along with the official maps.\n- Ranked and unranked matchmaking, as well as the ability to make custom lobbies\n- Can use the keyboard (my preference) or game controller\n\nNeeds Improvement:\n- Can be a bit glitchy sometimes, such as players teleporting through walls or floors, people winning when they weren't in first place sometimes, etc.\n- If your or your opponents internet connection or connection to the server isn't great it can cause your oppenents to teleport around the screen\n- Limited official maps. You go tend to memorize them pretty quickly.\n- Having to buy some of the characters is annoying, but understandable I suppose. Would be nice to have the ability to unlock them through gameplay\n- The single player campaign story is ok, but its kind of boring. Basically just a bunch of time trials (get to the bomb before it blows up) I don't have any ideas on how to make it better, but a little variety would go a long way.\n- The bots can be kind of dumb sometimes, running off the screen in the wrong direction or getting stuck at a paticular point and not being able to move past it.\n- The matchmaking needs a little work\n- Sometimes the ranked matches don't record your points properly\n\nMost of the "Needs Improvement" section is just nitpicky stuff that I'm sure will be cleared up by full launch. I really have nothing bad to say about the game, and woudl definitely recomend playing it. It's easy to learn, takes time to master some of the techniques and is great to play with friends. Easily worth $10. If you can shell out $70+ for a carbon copy fps every year you can afford to drop $10 on this great game.\n\n","December 28, 2014","true","29.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The idea is simplistic, 2d side scroller racing game, yet it has provided my friends and I hours of entertainment. It's great for LAN parties, where you can hear your friend rage at getting blown off the map by a bomb you set or being caught by your golden hook.\n\nThe good:\n- Fun, fast paced gameplay\n- Well balanced items. None of the items seems overpowered and there is a way to dodge most of them if youre quick.\n- Wall jumping is well implemented and very smooth.\n- Grappling hook is fun.\n- Workshop level editor and the ability to play user created levels along with the official maps.\n- Ranked and unranked matchmaking, as well as the ability to make custom lobbies\n- Can use the keyboard (my preference) or game controller\n\nNeeds Improvement:\n- Can be a bit glitchy sometimes, such as players teleporting through walls or floors, people winning when they weren't in first place sometimes, etc.\n- If your or your opponents internet connection or connection to the server isn't great it can cause your oppenents to teleport around the screen\n- Limited official maps. You go tend to memorize them pretty quickly.\n- Having to buy some of the characters is annoying, but understandable I suppose. Would be nice to have the ability to unlock them through gameplay\n- The single player campaign story is ok, but its kind of boring. Basically just a bunch of time trials (get to the bomb before it blows up) I don't have any ideas on how to make it better, but a little variety would go a long way.\n- The bots can be kind of dumb sometimes, running off the screen in the wrong direction or getting stuck at a paticular point and not being able to move past it.\n- The matchmaking needs a little work\n- Sometimes the ranked matches don't record your points properly\n\nMost of the "Needs Improvement" section is just nitpicky stuff that I'm sure will be cleared up by full launch. I really have nothing bad to say about the game, and woudl definitely recomend playing it. It's easy to learn, takes time to master some of the techniques and is great to play with friends. Easily worth $10. If you can shell out $70+ for a carbon copy fps every year you can afford to drop $10 on this great game.\n\n","December 28, 2014","true","29.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

A 2D platform racer, up to 4 players, local or online.  The Developers for SpeedRunners really found a small spot in video gaming which was never really used before.  SpeedRunners is a very easy game to play, but hard to master.  Typically thats an indication of a game which is will recieve great praise and longevity.  Everything this game does it does very well, it's really hard not to like SpeedRunners.  The game also supports Steam Workshop so there will be like a zillion maps to play.\n\nI predict this game will become so popular on Steam that there will be a demand for it on the consoles later on.

The music was fantastic, the mechanics were solid and the controls were tight.\n\nNow that that's out of the way...\n\nThis game is glitchy, sometimes game-breakingly so. It's not rare for someone to go into the blast zone and not die. The physics gets janky sometimes too, I remember sliding up a wall and then flying 300 feet in the air and instantly dying because of it. Also, some stages are very...random as to deciding who's in first, expecially when a player is able to do something that doesn't follow the regular path of a level. This makes it frustrating for experienced players who find shortcuts, because about 1/2 of the time they work and you win, or the game just decides to kill you.\nGlitches aside, there is a lot of variety in the maps and qualities unique to each one, but there's just too few of them. As of right now, there's only 9 stages to play in the whole game. Granted that the devs have done SOMETHING to try and solve this by allowing players to make custom stages publish them so that everyone else can play them too. In theory, that's a great idea, let the community make their own maps, and the good ones get upvoted and the bad ones will be lost to the sands of time. In reality, in a game where the only objective is to run around a stage the fastest, mediocre level design sticks out trememdously. Also, I am damn sick of Smash Bros remakes.\nLag really isn't much of an issue, and if it just so happens someone is lagging, the chances are very small that their lag will decide the game. +1 Paragon.\nWhat would decide the yay or nay for me is very simple. "Is there tension in this racing game?" The answer is yes, gratuitous amounts of it. The individual skills of each player grinding against one another creates tension in itself, but there's also items that you can pick up. This monumentally increases the depth of the game. For casual players, most items are used immediately with moderate effect  which gives the game a mariokart-esque feel. At higher levels (which surprisingly enough isn't that hard to reach) items are held until the exact moment where that specific item is going to be most effective. There's also a bit of thoughtful game design which I really wish we had more of in games in general. There's also a bit of game design genius surrounding the Golden Claw, the most powerful item in the game, but I won't get into that.\nMovement is tighter than a longbow string, no doubt about that. This makes it so that when you lose, you have only yourself to blame. Or that one ♥♥♥♥♥♥ who used the Golden Hook RIGHT OVER THE SPIKES YOU SONOFA-\nOverall it's a fantastic game that's worth the ten bucks especially if you have some friends to play it with.","September 19, 2014","true","20.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
