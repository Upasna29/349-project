I enjoyed the second one more than the first because it follows the hilarious "Great Cow Race" plotline.\n\nIt's a shame that this series was discontinued but at least we got two great games to play. Besides with the superb animations and voice acting, it could also double as a "Bone" cartoon...","March 14, 2015","true","3.2"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","14","16","0","0"

I wonder if the very first sentence in this game somehow tries to deal with the first part: "Last one was fun, don't get me wrong, but way too short."\n\nDon't try to exchange the udder for the helmet! It dead-ended the game for me. This is almost a spoiler but I hope it won't make sense to people unless they are in a position to make that mistake.\n\n+ Entertaining story\n+ More populated areas (people and objects) and dialogue\n+ Smiley Bone\n+ References: e.g. Monkey Island\n\n- Buggy: see helmet bug above and transitive object bug below\n- No fast-travel\n- Inconsistent controls: spacebar to skip lines\n- Over-clicking in dialogue\n- Sudden end of the series\n\nThe game is almost completely controllable by mouse except for skipping of dialogue lines which is done with the spacebar. Why is that not the one of the mouse buttons? There is no other functionality needed while someone is talking.\nSkipping may also lead to graphical bugs. You can win small objects in the game that are handed to you while dialogue is running. If you skip at that moment the object movement is not completed and the object hangs in the air. This is somehow amazing because it shows again how integrative the Telltale engine works - still a bug though.\nThere is a crate you can click which triggers a line from another character.. even when he's not around.\n\nSometimes the movement of the characters feels very slow, e.g. if you have to make a character do something at the other end of its movement range. I seriously missed some way to fast-travel, e.g. double-click or map-travel.\n\nSimilar to the first game there is a lot of intermediate clicking between lines of dialogue even though the thoughts presented follow quite different threads of conversation. I'd have liked the dialogue to unfold a bit more on it's own instead of making me click every two seconds for ten seconds on a clearcut piece of conversation.\n\nFrom the development in act one and two I'd expect three more acts to follow. Unfortunately it doesn't look like they will be done. Look around I didn't find any announcements from Telltale about the Bones, it's not even in Telltale's games list[www.telltalegames.com].\nI hear you can get the rest of the Bones' story and see how well the first two acts fit from the Bone comics - the first issue is online available here[www.boneville.com]. By the looks of the covers[www.boneville.com] I'd say 15 of 55 issues have been worked into "Out From Boneville" and "The Great Cow Race". Note the guest artists for the comic series.\n\nSince this game yet qualifies as an entertaining adventure I recommend it but suggest to wait for 50+% sale.","July 5, 2014","true","5.4"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","5"

The game can be played as a stand alone story without any prior knowledge of the Bone comic strip, or the pevious episode, but background knowledge is of course only beneficial.  As with the previous iteration, there is alcohol and tobacco use, as well as some cartoonish slapstick humor.  There are no bonus features, so the story plays out in a very linear manner.  Overall, the story is more humorous than the previous episode, and about double the length as well.  If you enjoyed the first episode, you owe it to yourself to try this one too.","January 7, 2014","true","4.1"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LuckIsMyOpium/recommended/8320/","LuckIsMyOpium","Lucky Shot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LuckIsMyOpium/","524 products in account","This game is far better than the first one. It's bigger, with more difficult puzzles (compared to ones in the first game), and has some fascinating missions. I really love the voice acting and the dialogues. Still, I love the Bone games, mostly because I love the Bone comics too. I feel like I forced myself to like these games. So, I'm not sure if everyone is going to love these games. Sadly, Telltale Games abandoned the Bone game series and they are left without a third game, so they're incomplete. With their current experience, Telltale Games would make an excellent third Bone game, so I really hope they will consider it.","October 10, 2015","true","3.2"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

Telltale made 2 chapters then abandoned the game. The substory of the cow race comes to a conclusion, but there isn't a major resolution to the story.  I cannot recommend a game that goes nowehre ultimately, no way. I felt the puzzles were more arbitrary and tedious than the first chapter, Out of Boneville.  As I've said before, I'm a huge fan of other Telltale games, but this is terrible and aimed at a younger audience. Skip it.\n\nIf you liked the first one, then you will like this game.","January 1, 2015","false","4.0"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","1"

It is probably only 2 hours of gameplay.  This game has a similar glitch that prevents running on Windows 10, but search the community board and you can find the workaround, and it is similar to the workaround for the first Bone game. (Delete a file, start the game, change settings, restart the game).\n\nDo you like Bone? Do you like Telltale style games?\nIf you like either of them, it might be a buy. But it's certainly not mandatory for fans of the Bone series.\n\nIt's the sequel to the first Bone game. It's a Telltale point-and-click adventure. I'm not a big fan of that style of game, but I love Bone.\n\nIt still has decent character models that look like the books. This game doesn't change the book, but it adds a lot. The gist is you have to help Fone through the fair to collect honey for Thorn, you have to help Smiley build the cow suit, and you have to help Phoney convince people to bet on the mystery cow. So most of the content is not in the book, but many of the bigger gags from the book make it to the game.\n\nSome of the voice acting grew on my after the first game. It's not good, but Smily and Phoney felt ok. The animation acting was usually poor. The puzzles aren't very good, and sometimes I had the annoying, "I know what do to, how to I get the game to let me do that," frustration that can come with this type of game. But there is a hint button that will help.\n","March 13","true","4.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This time you play as all three cousins instead of the two you played in the first one. The game picks up a little before the first episode ends where we find out how the guys ended up in the city. After escaping from the locust we find out that Grandma Ben's farm house has been destroyed they set onto compete in the Great cow race. While Phone bone tries to impress Thorn. Phoney and Smiley hatched a plan to win the Race for themselfs and take the bet winnings while we find out that the locust are still trying to catch and kill Phone Bone. So how is the sequel ? Overall i liked this more than the first act since i liked the puzzles more in this one cause they were a bit tougher to figure out.  The gameplay is still the same as the first one but this time you can switch to witch charecter you want to play on the fly. The script is funny and the game is very fun. But there are a few problems with the game. Its quite short and the biggest turn off for some people im gonna try to avoid spoiling it here but the game ends on a cliffhanger which is never resolved (unless youve read the comic books) Overall this is a very fun adventure game. Definetly get both episodes of Bone cause its really fun. I give Bone: The Great Cow Race a 8/10","January 17, 2015","true","3.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","5","8","3","0"

If you would like to see my review of the first one, go check the store and my review is there somewhere. This one is more difficult than the first one. Now, I cheated in this one. I used the help button throughout, making it only take me three hours to beat. Now, if yoiu don't use it, and have never played it, it should take you longer to beat it than the first one. Unlike the first one, this one has more difficulty and problem-solving skills. It even has the possibility of playing as Smiley Bone, as well as Fone Bone and Phoney Bone. In the first game, you couldn't switch between characters whenever you wanted to and you couldn't play as Smiley Bone. The thing about this is that every character you play as is connected in some way. So, when you do a certain thing with one character, it makes it hwlps one of the other characters. When you are finished doing everything possible with one character, you are unable to use that character anymore, so that it makes it simpler for you sto know what to do next. The mini games are minimal in this game, unlike the first one, and concentrates more on problem solving. It is much more entertaining than the first one, much more difficult, and much longer (if you don't use the help button). I recommend this game and I give it 9 out of 10.","August 31, 2014","true","3.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"
