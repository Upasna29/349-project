I've just hit the car while parking and no points were taken from me, game only considers some area to activate "success" trigger if your car touches this area. This is a good idea to give people some software to train their driving but I see laziness of developers in every aspect of this game.","September 25, 2014","false","0.6"," 245 of 284 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","245","284","4","6"

Running red lights, hitting pedestrians, failing to give way.\nAI cars never indicate.\nAI cars will change into your lane regardlessif you are right next to them or not\nStop signs have absolutely no meaning in this game.\nExcept on the highway map, you can drive anywhere you want on the road (or on the side) as long as you dont cross the center if it is a solid line.\nCars are oversized for the roads, Buses barely fit.\nCity corners are square which is hard to turn a car around. Buses have to drive on the sidewalk.\nPedestrian crossing are randomly placed, usually with no lighting which makes nighttime driving pretty hazardous.\nPedestrians WILL cross the road regardless if you are too close to stop. They WILL walk into the side of a bus causing a penalty.\nLights at smaller intersection change rapidly and will cause you to lose points if you have not exited in time (buses nearly always lose points).\nNo cabin view, which is ok for cars, but makes driving a bus challenging.\nTerrible mouse control for adjusting view. No options for quick change or centering. Need to fight to looking backwards.\nKeyboard driving controls are terrible making driving on the highway map near impossible.\nLow beam does nothing. High beam is nearly as good as you would expect from low beam. Limit cone width. Signs do not reflect the light until you are nearly on top of them. No penalty for driving with high beam all the time. no option to switch from high beam to low beam.\nSign visiblity is low so you barely have time to see a speed change and react.\nAny Steam notifiactions pop up right over your speed, despite 2 corners having absolutley nothing in them.\nThere is more but I think you get the general idea.\n\nFor a driving game I would rate this 2/10\nFor a driving game that claims to educate, I am hesitant to give 1/10\nBTW, I lied about the nudity so looks like that brings it to 0/10\n","November 23, 2014","false","6.7"," 70 of 79 people (89%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","89","70","79","25","9"

The game is only $15.00 and whether or not you should pick it up will honestly fall back on what you feel an appropriate price tag should be.  I myself would have waited for a sale had I not received a press copy.  It's not a bad game and does have the potential to offer a lot, but some of the implimentation of these features were pretty lazy.  My advice is to check out gameplay videos (like the one below) to see if it's something you feel is worth $15.00 ($12 until Oct 2, 2014).  Steam really needs a "maybe" button...my recommendation would have fallen into that category perfectly.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoORTv5MWBY\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZwC3pzdpJI","September 26, 2014","false","2.8"," 71 of 93 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","71","93","3","4"

A pedestrian walked across the road and rolled a car over in a collision. Yes, pedestrians are stronger than cars in this game.\n\nYou can be merrily driving about, one tiny nudge to the left (that used to allign you correctly) makes you take a violent 50 degree turn into oncoming traffic. No reasons, only penalties. It also doesn't properly judge where traffic lights start, and why the heck you're forced to park in reverse is anyone's guess.\n\nWhilst trying to park in reverse, I drove in and out of an entire building without any penalties. It was simply an illusion.\n\nPut together as well as Big Rigs, but that at least lets you blast off into orbit.
