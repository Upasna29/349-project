"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tiavals/recommended/376790/","tiavals","tiavals","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tiavals/","413 products in account","A very fascinating game with an interesting user interface. Compared to the more "gamey" Sherlock Holmes games, this one is more about you as the player thinking about the facts, instead of relying on the game telling you what to do and what it means.\n\nThe gameplay consists of you poring through newspapers, and lists of people and locations, the main idea being that YOU have utter freedom on how to proceed, which place to go, whom to interrogate, with the game providing no "path" for you to follow, except for the clues that you've gathered so far. Really good concept.\n\nThere are some problems with it, though, mainly that the only "penalty" for going to an "empty" place(only some are connected to the case and thus have full motion video that gives you more clues) is that you gain a number of "time points" that measure how effectively you've solved the case. These have no bearing on the game as such. Thus, you'll have to impose restrictions to yourself so as to only go to logical places you've deduced, instead of just going through everything one at a time in order for it to make more sense. Once you've solved the case, your results are compared to a "perfect sherlock" score as to see how well you did in comparison with the great detective. That's really the only reason to refrain from doing everything mindlessly, your own pride.\n\nThe other sort of problematic thing is that the game records clues fairly randomly. There's an in-game notebook that has some things written on it based on what you've seen on the FMVs when you visit places. The problem is that most of the critical information is still in the FMV itself, so you'll often have to rewatch the whole FMV(no rewinding) to remind yourself of a particular clue. This can be annoying since the FMVs can be a few minutes long, which means pointless waiting since there's no skipping the video to a particular timestamp, at least that I found. For example, visting the crimescene triggers an FMV where Holmes and Watson talk to a person before studying the crimescene, and thus I'm forced to watch the talking part every time I want to inspect the crimescene, which can be bothersome. Skipping around the video would be hugely useful and make everything far less tedious, without really compromising anything of the enjoyability of the game.\n\nThere are some problems that arise from the game seemingly being a port from an iPad or such, I think? There are no scrollbars for example, so you'll have to use the mousewheel to scroll through the notebook, which can be tedious.\n\nOverall the case is quite logical, but quite short as well. Took me 2 hours to solve, I think, based on my playing time. There's one big problem in the case for me, which I can't really say due to spoilers, but the fact that it isn't addressed annoys me greatly, since there wasn't an explanation on why it's ignored, and in my opinion it impacts the deductions on the case quite a lot.\n\nThere's also a few strange typos, or things being referred with another name in one place than the next, despite it clearly being the same thing in question, which lead to some confusion on my part.\n\nThe overacted FMV clips add a certain charm to it, which may be very annoying to some people, since it's verily not-serious, with overblown sound effects when new clues are told to Sherlock or Watson, and so on.\n\nIn the end, I believe it was easily worth the money I paid, since even though I might've been only a few hours long, the price is equally low, so it balances out. I'd love to see more games in this style, since it's utterly fascinating. That the game allows me to solve the case by going through my own deductive path, without giving any hints or treating me like a dimwit is very refreshing and frankly works surprisingly well on the computer, despite not using anything even remotely close to modern graphics or gameplay. The game as it is, could've easily been made in the early 90s(maybe it was, I know little of the history of the game, whether it's actually new, old, or whatever), but that doesn't mean that it's bad, just that the design of the game is very, very different from what you'd expect from a modern game, especially if you compare it to any of the other Sherlock style games.","June 9, 2015","true","2.1"," 47 of 48 people (98%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","98","47","48","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thecloser17/recommended/376790/","thecloser17","TheCloser17","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thecloser17/","120 products in account","will start off by saying that this game has very little to actually "do" in it, it is more of an interactive story almost, but not quite. The object of all three of the Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective mysteries is to gather clues by deciding on what people and places to visit. Once you have gotten enough information to solve the crime/s you will go before a judge and he will ask a few questions that you must answer correctly.  Getting to the judge and answering questions using the fewest amount of clues that you can will give you a score. The goal is to solve the mystery by using only as many clues as it takes Holmes to solve the mystery. There is not a lot of replay ability in the game except if your score doesn't match Holmes' once you have solve the mystery.  I wouldn't expect it to take very many playthorughs to match Holmes scores.\n\nIf you like Sherlock Holmes , or some not too hard brain teasers, you will enjoy the game. It is only about 60-90 mins of total gameplay in most instances for each mystery. As for the price, I would definitely go the collection route as it's almost half price. I would probably also wait til it might be on sale as well.","January 20","true","1.4"," 20 of 20 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","20","20","0","0"

The production values are above average and the case isn't just spoon fed to you.\n\nOne thing:  It is SHORT.  Expect to have the entire game finished in 60-90 minutes.  Should you choose to pursue it, a perfect scoring run can be pieced together in 2-3 hours.  After that, there's absolutely no replay value to speak of.\n\nOverall, a decent but short game.  Would not recommend full price given short run time, but at 99 cents or less it's probably worth picking up.\n\nOne final note:  While researching this game I came across a board of the same name that seemingly covers the exact same case.  If you've played that board game to completion I would pass on this game.","November 9, 2015","true","2.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

It's an extremely short type of game where a single play-through will run you about 30 minutes.\n\nThe game's format is identical to other 2 in the series with no improvements or further detractors. The gameâ€™s age isn't an issue at all really; the acting though, is quite unlike any Sherlock we've seen. (Painful to get through at times.) This is truly a one and done kind of game!\n\nWorth about $0.50 or so; what I'd pay for 30-45 minutes of fun.\n\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

Follow the threads in a mystery, talk to experts and witnesses, piece together clues and figure out whodunnit. But this particular case is a mess, all because of one absurd contrivance at the end.\n\nYou can follow the evidence, establish motives, connect other events, eliminate suspects with deduction, etc. But when it's all said and done, the only person with the ability to participate in several key events never did. How's that possible? Well it's possible because the game straight up invents nonsense science that's neither supported by reality or by the evidence within the game. An intuitive leap to pull all the pieces together is fine, but it should be a leap to something that can actually happen.\n\nThe SHCD system is brilliant. I hope the other cases do it more justice.","April 23","false","1.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game is rather short and took just under two hours to finish. It was entertaining and thought-provoking and the video clips throughout are at times humorous. The cost of the game is reasonable although requires reading heaps of little bits of information, plus a little patience is also desirable. The interface is simple and easy to use and there are helpful and informative tutorials available.\n\nI would recommend this game for people who enjoy and love the stories of Sherlock Holmes and is interested in going on a small adventure with Holmes and Watson.","March 7","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
