Yes I did.\n\nLet me explain.\n\nAll games I play I start on the hardest possible settings. I dislike easy mode because bad habits and the real intent of the developers never shines through. (The devs need to make games easy for some people because they're either time-poor or effort-poor and well, their money and wishes are just as important right?)\n\nAnd this does that. In SE, easy mode doesn't teach you anything. It's a "Lego meet Asteroids" style and some even called it for a "Minecraft" clone as a result. Add building block. Add another block, and another ad infinitum until you have spaceship. For me, it got boring quickly. It's called "creative mode"- just... build.\n\nAnd then there's survivor mode - on hard. Whoa!! I struggled for the first few hours. With little in the way of documentation and no real clue as to what to do, it took me over an hour to work out how to build a single block from the remains of a craft crashed into an asteroid.\n\nFirst there's survival. Have I got enough uranium for power? Should I turn on the gravity generator? How can I save energy until I can salvage enough to.... live?\n\nI need to mine. I NEED fuel. I can mine using my included hand drill but it's... messy. Slow. Trite.\n\nSo to mine I need a mining ship. To build a mining ship I need components. To make components I need an assembler. To use the assembler I need steel. I need glass. I need energy.\n\nAnd all I have is a drill. I have a grinder. I have a welder. And in my scenario, I have a ship I can salvage.\n\nPiece by piece with a grinder, all the while careful of my energy limit, my inventory. I need a refinery. The refinery is needed if salvage doesn't give me everything I need so I'll need raw material to convert to ingots, including uranium ore which I convert to processed uranium to fuel the reactor so I can do ALL these things.\n\nDo you see where this is going?\n\nTo build my mining ship I need a mining drill. To build the drill I need motors, steel etc. Some of these can be salvaged. Some have to be made. Every component needs to located, transported, linked and welded. EVERY component. You need a plan. A rough sketch on what you intend to build helps alot. It gives you purpose because time is of the essence. if you're not watching and run out of fuel you're.... dead. No energy means no refining of uranium ore to refuel.\n\nIt's a grind. And a weld. Yep. Grind and weld. Hour after hour floating in your pressure suit. Maybe you can leave the grav gen on and walk around, expending more of that precious reactor fuel. Who knows. The decisions you make determine what you build and how fast it's going to take.\n\nThe flying is... space like. There's 3 dimensions. There's gravity. There's velocity. There's death. There's no attitude indicators, sky markers, "horizon" indicators, compasses or such.\n\nFly too far, lose your bearings and home.... disappears.\n\nThere are no fixed paths or objectives (apart from survive). It's a sandbox. And a multiplayer sandbox at that. Go public, lose it all or go "friends only" and do the hard yards with mates to build the biggest dang skyship ever made. There's missiles, guns, turrets, fire and light. Death. There's explosions, broken platforms, busted ships.\n\nOr there's serenity and wonder as you quietly go about your mining ship construction.\n\nThe game caters for everybody from MP gung-ho blast'em players to SP anal-retentives with spreadsheets, CAD and a master plan.\n\nAt alpha, a lot of the options are not as intuitive as I'd like. The UI is a bit invasive and some work could be done here. The universe is.... grey. I'm sure some awesome nebulae would fit in great here and add appeal to the wonder of space.\n\nThere are glitches,  it's alpha as I write, but I've experienced no crashes. It's going to be good thing this Space Engineers and the devs seem happy to include...whatever people damn well please.\n\n7 hours went by in a single session. I'm only half through building my mining ship. I have no objective but to succeed.\n\nMy epiphany? What is success in SE?\n\nIt's when I finish this ship, I'll mine, refine, transport and assemble another. It'll be bigger. It'll do more. The welding torch will blind my eyes as I drift in and out of the superstructure boundaries, my suit energy draining away.\n\nI'm fascinated.\n\nTHIS can only get better...\n\n9.5/10\ngg","May 4, 2014","true","152.2"," 3,079 of 3,310 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","079","3","3","96"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/auhrii/recommended/244850/","auhrii","Auhrii","http://steamcommunity.com/id/auhrii/","85 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nQuick disclaimer: I may or may not be somewhat biased due to the 812 853! hours that I may or may not have put into this game at the time of writing.\n\nOverall Verdict\nThough I hate myself for saying this, Space Engineers is practically Minecraft if it were set in space and had awesome damage modelling. Damage modelling so good, in fact, that it was the main selling point of the game when it first came out. Here's a quick list of pros and cons for quick reference:\n\nPros\nGreat damage modelling (armour blocks deform as they collide with other objects and/or are shot at by the inevitable gang of players and/or AI pirates who want to pillage your scrap metal)\nSandbox mechanics and (mostly) reasonable balancing\nAlready has Steam Workshop support with an active modding community\nWorlds can be fine-tuned to suit your play style using what I can only describe as a wall of tick-boxes\nIn-game programming (using a sandboxed C# implementation) that allows for automation without severely impacting gameplay balance\nAlready peer-to-peer and dedicated multiplayer support\nFrequent updates (every Thursday!)\nCons\nSUPER IMPORTANT: This game has dropped support for DX9 and Windows XP! If you have a system that only supports either of these, you can still play the last version to support them by choosing the WinXP/DX9 branch in the game properties.\nPretty performance heavy at the moment (though I can run on high settings with a mobile i7 and GTX 860M at around 50fps in most cases)\nMultiplayer is currently plagued with issues; rubber-banding is the most common, and dedicated servers suffer from game breaking bugs\nOverall, I highly recommend this game. That said, I am a recluse who never, ever plays multiplayer on any game under any circumstances unless it's on a private server.\n\nSurvival Mechanics\nFor those who are planning to buy this for the survival mode, I'll be completely honest: Space Engineers does it slightly differently, but it's not revolutionary. You have 3 main worries whilst in space: Energy, Oxygen (assuming you enabled Oxygen in the world settings) and Hydrogen. Energy and Oxygen deplete over time (the former depletes faster as you use tools, and the latter only depletes if you have your helmet closed), and you need to mine Ice to put in an electrolyser to replenish your O2 and H2 supplies. Hydrogen, as you could probably guess, is required for your jetpack to function, and depletes faster if you jetpack whilst in a natural gravity field (artificial fields have no effect).\n\nNow on to the environmental hazards - you can currently enable meteor showers with varying intensities, ranging from "Safe" (no showers, just worry about your ships being disintegrated if you get shot at or use rotors/pistons anywhere within a 1km radius) to "Armageddon" (where huge, flaming chunks of rock hurl themselves at everything you cherish every couple of minutes). Unfortunately, this feature didn't live up to potential and feels half-baked - meteor showers lock on to a random ship each wave, instead of being truly random (this would be excusable in higher settings, as they are unrealistic anyway), and the meteors aren't affected by planet atmospheres. Like everything, though, this is subject to change as the game is still Alpha, yadda, yadda, yadda.\n\nAs for hostile NPCs, I'll start first with cargo ships (which are currently disabled due to issues with planets - Keen says they'll bring them back Soon™): they currently choose a random position at least 10km from all players to spawn in, choose a heading that won't bring them within 5km of any player (from experience) and spawn in moving in that direction at a set speed. All of them (with the exception of the first pirate craft, the Argentavis) have no AI and will only stop if the player either attaches a ship and brakes or accesses the ship's control panel and enables the inertial dampeners. However, it should be noted that many of these ships (if not all of them) have automated turrets which *do* have AI and *will* fire on you if you approach within 800m, assuming you have weapons enabled in the world (these tick-boxes getting old yet?), and some vessels even contain hidden surprises that... well... "surprise" you if you happen to enable their dampeners.\nThen there are the actual NPC NPCs (I suck at explaining, shush), assuming you enabled them in world settings: "Sabiroids", which appear on alien-type planets, and "Cyberhounds", which appear on Earth-like worlds. I've already rambled on long enough, so I'll condense this. The Sabiroids are basically giant metal-eating space spiders that will tear your ships asunder should you happen to leave them unguarded on the ground, but will drop the components they eat should you kill them. Cyberhounds, as the name would suggest, are robotic hounds that charge at the nearest player without any kind of pathfinding (from my 5-minute first experience with them before I found them boring and disabled them), very slowly destroying blocks that happen to (very regularly) get in their way.\n\nEnd Token\nThanks for reading this very, very long-winded and probably rambling review, and I hope it proves useful - if not, feel free to suggest what I should add/change/remove in the comments, and I'll see to it at the next opportunity. Thanks again!","March 26","true","905.4"," 717 of 761 people (94%) found this review helpful 54 people found this review funny","94","717","761","54","18"

My partner in crime placed the blocks. I welded them in place and splashed some paint on it all once the basic shape of it was finished. It was not large, but it was clean, functional, and designed with sophistication.  It was ours, and we had built it out from the tiny little square of space we had started with, turned it into our own little command post lodged in the side of an otherwise unnoteworthy asteroid.\n\nThe ships came first, though. Without the ships, there were no resources to build with. First was the mining ship. We equipped it with four sets of drills and my partner took it out on missions to gather more resources. He was gone, and so I built our second ship: a fast little cruiser made only to get from one place to the next or to scout out potential mining sites. We called it the Toad. And so we settled into a routine: I would take the Toad out and find a nice planet ready for excavation and he would go plow into it with the mining ship. We unloaded the materials. We assembled them into parts. We put those parts into the blocks he had put down. We toiled. We slaved. We built and built and built.\n\nAnd when it all was done? When everything was in place? What did we do then? Did we recline in our player base? Did we look out over the catwalk railing and say, "Look what we have built from nothing. Admire our structure." Did we bask in the glory of a hard fifteen hours of work?\n\nNo. We planned. We created. We started on the true project, the beginning of our empire: the Mothership.\n\nIt was designed to be bigger than our entire station: two refineries of its own, three storage containers, twelve gigantic thrusters, enough room in the hangars to store both of our ships (and possibly more), several medical bays to respawn in—and one ridiculously enormous ship. We placed the first block above our station. And then another and another, until the massive frame of it started to block out the light. It was a monolith to our own accomplishments, a totem of sheer ingenious design and willpower. Not a block was out of place, not a single reactor was missing.\n\nAnd then we ran out of resources. The frame was all done, but the blocks couldn't be finished without more steel plates. We need iron—a lot of iron. So away my partner went! He climbed into the mining ship, steered it towards our latest excavation site and gunned the engines. He hit max speed. He piloted the ship around the end of the ghost-like frame of the Mothership. And then it happened—the unthinkable: he ran out of fuel.\n\nPop Quiz: An object in motion . . .\n\nStays in motion. And he clipped it. He clipped the mother ship. Grazed right off of it and, with no way to stop the mining ship from moving forward, had to bail out of the ship before it carried him away to oblivion. There was a panicked rush to mount a rescue of our mining ship by using the Toad to chase after it so we could supply the mining ship with the fuel its reactor needed to activate the reverse thrusters and stop the ship.\n\nWe gathered the fuel. We undocked the ship. We prepared to launch. Then, with the slow, heart-pounding realization of a horror film, a shadow passed over the Toad.  We looked up at the Mothership, our entire view eclipsed by its awesome mass. We dropped our tools and stared in gut-twisting horror.\n\nThe whole thing.\n\nTilting.\n\nSpinning.\n\nMoving.\n\nCrashing.\n\nThis is what happens when you let normal people pretend like they're Space Engineers.","January 12, 2015","true","21.8"," 458 of 475 people (96%) found this review helpful 442 people found this review funny","96","458","475","442","10"

I usually take a fat pinch of salt when I see new 'build your own' style game comes come onto Steam too. Not in this case. Space Engineers has quickly earned a spot in my all time favorite PC games for its dynamic and engaging construction system and it's got one of the coolest looking destruction systems I've ever seen in a game like this. The devs have been keeping up with weekly updates since its launch and they're very involved with the community. As a matter of fact, player made content will be appearing as randomly spawned ships in the upcoming exploration patch.\n\nThe construction system is very simple, even familiar for most people I'm sure. It's like Minecraft, in that you're building pretty much everything out of blocks, but that's where the similarities end. Ships are made by sticking a power plant, cockpit, a couple gyroscopes and thrusters (In every direction by the way! Space has no gravity or atmosphere so your ship needs forward thrusters to slow down, etc), maybe a few weapon systems. Then you have to hook up conveyor pipes to most of those things to power them with resources and components you get from mining asteroids. Ships can be as big or as small as you like, the only real limit is how much your PC can handle. Everything from little scout fighters, mining ships, frigates, fighter carriers and even humongous titan-sized battleships can be built. Yes, you could even build your own Death Star, but you might have to wait a little while for a working Superlaser. Or you could just mod your own Superlaser into the game, because Space Engineers has a modding API and a fully fledged Steam Workshop page that's already crammed with all sorts of player created content.\nThere's also an integrated blueprints system (And a corresponding hologram projector for constructing saved blueprints from scratch) so you can save ships and carry them over to other servers/maps, or if the first ship you had gets destroyed and you want a replacement, you can just ctrl-v it into the game after selecting it from the blueprints menu. Very very handy.\n\nShips and stations crumple, tear and otherwise deform when they take damage, whether you're hosing them down with lead, setting off explosions or just smashing into eachother for fun. You can see the damage your ship takes over time as holes, scratches, dents and warping are modelled into most blocks. Even portions of your ship can be sheared off and cause extra damage as they free float in space, getting knocked around and causing even more havoc as they get caught on your ship and tear it apart from the inside if you're not careful. The same rules apply to your enemy too though. It's very exciting and sometimes anxiety-inducing, the way combat works.\n\nThere are two gameplay modes currently, survival and creative. Survival mode lets you build everything from scratch and assemble it together using the various ingame tools you're provided with. Everything needs to be constructed piece by piece and you're limited by how many resources you have and what kind of tools you have available. You can mount bigger and better drills, welders and grinders onto your ships after you acquire enough supplies.\nCreative mode is exactly what it sounds like; you have free reign to do whatever you like in the galaxy and everything is constructed instantly the second you place it down.\n\nA pretty solid multiplayer mode with player-created factions and servers was patched in a while ago. It even supports mods. I haven't spent a lot of time online aside from on my own private server I play with one or two friends on but there's practically no change between offline and online gameplay aside from some occasional connectivity and performance issues.\nThe multiplayer still needs quite a bit of polishing, as does the overall performance of the game, but so far it's come together very very nicely and I expect I'll put another fifty hours or so into the game before it's released.\n\nIf you're into Star Wars, Battlestar Galactica, Warhammer 40k or any other scifi genre, buy this game. You'll thank me later.","December 16, 2014","true","208.3"," 233 of 247 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","233","247","0","0"

Many of these 350 hours were enjoyable, and if you'd asked me 6 months ago whether to buy this game, I 100% would have told you to go for it.\n\nThe conceptual design of the game is amazing.  The way the ships lock together through all the different engineering features is just plain awesome.  The dynamic nature and wide range of build options will unleash your creative child, and you'll find yourself spending many hours nutting out tricky designs to see what works best.\n\nThe community is even better.  The people I've met playing SE have usually been mature and fun to play with.  There's always a few exceptions .. but hey, we're gamers, right?  The mod community is extremely active and you can find a mod for just about anything.\n\nSo why won't I recommend this game?  Well ...\n\nIt's buggy.\n\nAnd by buggy I don't just mean buggy in an annoying way.  I mean buggy in a way that will progressively drive you crazy.\n\nWith early access, this is normally forgivable.  Early access itself comes with an implicit promise that the developer will eventually fix most (if not all) of the bugs and eventually release the game.  So paying cash for something in early access usually involves developing a thick skin for the bugs.  I knew this going in, and it didn't stop me.\n\nBut after 2 years in early access, a disappointing pattern has been emerging with this game.  I don't think that the person responsible for prioritising the work for SE actually plays the game.  If they did, they would likely be running things very differently.\n\nAt the moment SE is running a weekly release cycle.  Mid to late in the week, the developers push out an update containing features and often a few fixes.  The root problem seems to be that each update brings too many features, and not enough fixes.\n\nThe result is that over time, what initially started as a fairly simple physics sandbox game has evolved into a massively ambitious project full of unfinished features.  Almost every time a feature is released, it gets 90% done, then left on a shelf.  Sometimes the 10% isn't that important, and the feature is worthwhile.  More often the 10% is something rather critical (like ability to work in multiplayer) and the feature simply becomes a point of frustration, as you spend hours trying to make it work or basing designs off it, only to have it fail you in the worst possible ways.\n\nI have very limited experience in games development, but 15 years in the software industry have taught me that letting the bugs stack up is a really bad way to develop a product.  The longer a bug remains in software, the harder it is to fix.  The more you stack on an unstable codebase, the buggier it gets.  The SE forums are completely littered with bug reports, many of them very serious.  The developers know about the bugs, but instead of fixing them, they just add more features.\n\nI don't think this is going to end well for SE.  At the time of writing this review, I can no longer stand to play the game through the seemingly endless number of bugs that plague it.  It's starting to look like one of two things will happen:\n\n1. SE will stay in early access forever.  It will continue to sell copies.  The developers will keep adding features.  The bugs will keep stacking up, until some critical level is reached where people get so frustrated that the review standings and sales plummet.  Development then scales back (or stops) and the game is left in early access.\n\n2. SE will leave early access in a buggy state, not with the level of stability expected in a finished product.  This will in turn lead to lots of disappointed people, bad ratings, and probably a collapse in sales and support.\n\nI want Keen Software to prove me wrong in this.  I would LOVE for them to prove me wrong, and get SE out of early access into a stable state where it can be as awesome as it deserves to me.  But with every feature release, I lose a little more faith.  This seems to be a constant problem with the approach of funding games using early access - there is no commercial incentive to ever actually leave early access.\n\nSo it looks like SE for me will remain a broken dream.  To anyone that is considering buying this game, I recommend first taking a look at Empyrion - its build system isn't yet as sophisticated but even in its very early days I found it much more stable than SE.\n\nBut if you can't resist and you really want to buy the game, be careful with the following features.  They will give you little but frustration:\n\n- Pistons and Rotors (these mess up the centre of gravity in ships, and intermittently cause massive unexplained velocity/damage - especially in multiplayer)\n- Wheels (no effective brakes + other physics bugs)\n- Small ship conveyors (these don't bridge effectively with normal conveyors. The blocks that connect them are intemittently unreliable)\n- Landing gear (hitching and physics issues, especially in multiplayer), connectors are better\n- Batteries on complex power grids (when combined with reactors and solar panels, these need to be micro-managed.  It's improved recently, but will still drive you crazy)\n- Projectors (these will destabilise servers in multiplayer, giving big crash issues.  Big loss as there's no way to move ships to survival mode without them)\n- Large ships and complex worlds (the game server itself seems to run all ticks on a single thread, so any more than 1 CPU core is wasted.  This means there's no way it can scale as ships get bigger and worlds get more complex.  Everything just slows down)\n- Ships parked on unlevel planet surfaces in multiplayer (jerks around like crazy, can be very disappointing as it often destroys the ship)\n\n---------- 15th January 2016\n\nThere's been some interesting developments lately for the SE project.  Marek Rosa (the controller/owner of Keen Software and first dev on the SE project) has taken a renewed interest in the game and earlier this week, he did a live stream over twitch where he played it online.  The stream was very revealing as it showed how little exposure Marek has had to the current state of the game.  Over most of the stream, he was chatting with the other devs and pointing out issues with the game that he wanted to see fixed.  More information on this here - https://www.reddit.com/r/spaceengineers/comments/40jbfk/marek_rosa_says_this_is_♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t_to_space/\n\nIt's become pretty clear that many of the development problems in SE have originated from a gap in leadership.  Marek seems to have realised this and is taking serious steps to exert more control over the project.  Today he posted a lengthly article consisting of a very long list of issues with the game he wants to see addressed, with a strongly worded commitment to fix bugs and get the product out of an early access state - http://blog.marekrosa.org/2016/01/the-ksh-roadmap-for-2016-space_14.html\n\nI find this very encouraging.  Perhaps there is hope for SE yet.  Considering the current broken state of the game, I'm not yet ready to recommend it to others, but I do think this is one to watch.  If Keen can make significant progress towards fixing SE in 2016, it may just become a game worth buying.","December 8, 2015","false","360.9"," 1,101 of 1,337 people (82%) found this review helpful 53 people found this review funny","82","101","1","53","119"

This game is fantastic, and you'll hate every hour you spend on it.\n\n--- To Begin ---\n\nI have been a part of the Space Engineers community for quite a very long time. Although at first, the game was still being developed (as in... Before weapons, detonations, and the etc existed at all). By then, I enjoyed the game for a while however was never extremely hardcore into it. This all ended up changing around the past month and so however. With the introuction of new community groups, factions, and of course mods, (also of course the content being added every week) the game has never had a segment of any real 'boredom'.\n\n--- Graphics ---\n\nThe graphics on this game are done pretty well for many of the Sandbox Sims I have seen out and around. It is noted though, that to run this game on higher graphics settings you -will- require an at least decent PC to run this game sufficiently. There are of course a few glitches with the Early Access still above, such as a few lighting and shading bugs here and there, and the occasional block bug ot glitch. Overall though, the graphics and physics are all well and nice to look at (for the hours you will spend in the realms of space), of course.\n\n--- Gameplay ---\n\nThe gameplay is something that will vary depending on you yourself. If you enjoy building new (NOT FEATURED!)land, orbital, or space creations; enjoy exploring the infinite fields of asteroids, (NOW FEATURED!)planets, moons, and simply space; and would want to join the already growing and very friendly, creative and supportive community, then this is the game for you! The gameplay is fairly simple to a certain degree, the building being commonly referred to as 'minecraft in space'. This, however, changes drasticly past the simple placement of blocks, such as the production chains from mineral ore, to basic materials that can be processed into components that then are used to build and create each block in the game. This is a game where commonly you would want to play with a friend or even more (the more the better!).\n\n--- Community ---\n\nThe Space Engineers Community is one of (if not the) most active and creative communities I have grown to be a part of on Steam. The Workshop houses hundreds of thousands of player-made creations ranging from spaceships of combat, commerce, and civilian use, as well as stations of all types, ground vehicles and orbital ships, as well as now including land bases. There are also an array of hundreds of player factions, from pirates and mercccenaries of war, to civilian trading corporations and industrial commerce administrations. There is never a shortage of player-created factions, and it is always a great idea to find one that suits your interests best, and join in to meet other and new friends, and to share designs, tips, and your own universe experiences.\n\n--- Concluding ---\n\nOverall, Space Engineers is a wonderful game. Although there are of course bugs, errors, and situations that occur, this is  still in Early Access. The game itself is doing quite well so far, and I, alike many many others, are excited to see what will be released next. The release of planets today is a revolutionary new feature as well (Although it is a bit of a framerate kill on weaker PCs). Multiplayer still does have a bit of connection and server bugs, however it is functional and does work for the majority (though most problems I have experienced were from the server hosts themselves).\n\nAll in all, a great game, and I recommend it for any space, simulator, or sandbox fan.\n\nAlways remember, have fun!

Even though it's early access, this feels like a whole title. Even if the developers were to drop it completely (which they show zero signs of doing), it would still be worth $20. Some quick pro/cons:\nPRO:\n+Massive creative potential.\n+Good modding community.\n+Strong multiplayer.\n+Active and player-friendly developers.\n\nCON:\n-Difficult UI. I had to look up tutorials on YouTube to get a decent idea of how to do things (Thanks, Gas Bandit!).\n***This has since been fixed with a tutorial! Told you the developers were awesome.\n-Little guidance, expects you to tough out the rookie mistakes and learn\n***Again, see above edit. Developers are awesome.\n-Brutal PvP online. Do NOT go online without playing single player first and getting the hang of things.\n\nI love this game. It's tough on your computer, though. It runs on my laptop, but barely. Definitely stick with smaller ships and maps unless you have a monster gaming PC. With a little help regarding the UI, some optimization to improve performance, and just more of what the devs have been doing, by the time this hits 1.0 it will be one of the best games of it's kind.\n\nTL;DR- This game is good, doesn't feel like early access. Make sure to check the min/rec'd specs, as it's pretty demanding of your PC. Watch tutorials online (check out Gas Bandit on YouTube) to not be a noob floundering and dying for 3 hours straight.\n\nEDIT: My laptop has 4 GB of RAM, i3 M370 2.4 GHz (I think. Computer stuff isn't my thing). I stay on small world settings, very few asteroids, basically bottom end graphics. If you can run Skyrim, Civ 5, Kerbal Space Program, then you can run this.

A botched docking by my somewhat less-skilled colleague melted half the platforms off, and now we’re both trying to catch the bits that are left floating through space. A few minutes of work later we complete the job, just as a business shipment appears at the edge of our sector. A silent nod later, he’s in an interceptor and I’m in a cargo whale both chasing down the hapless vessel. I attach to the front end and slow it to a stop with my powerful thrusters, before both of us rush through and check for traps. I cut through a block, without realising that it was where the entire front end was attached. My colleague grumbles and curses as the dissected ship gently drifts apart.

Before symmetry mode was a thing, before survival mode, before thruster damage or multiplayer or many common mechanics were implemented.\n\nI've got nearly 430 hours into it now, and I'll definitely rack up a lot more. Here's why.\n\n-Infinite possibilities.\nDo you want to build a racetrack in space and dash around in gravity-tethered go-carts? You can do that. Demolition derby? Sure, that's feasible. Starfighter dogfights? Yup, you bet'cha. Capital ship slugfests? Seen 'em, they're pretty. Just build without restrictions, build whatever you can imagine? Ayup. Survival mode? Oh, oh hell yeah.\n\n-Multiplayer\nSometimes sketchy, but generally reliable as of the last few patches, Space Engineers multiplayer is genuinely fun. Not in the shoot 'em up bang bang pew pew sort of way, more of the mutual cooperation so you don't all suffocate and die horribly in space sort of way. It's a huge change of pace, and the recent updates have made it feasible to do more than merely survive. You can explore, you can wander the 'verse and see all the beauty and horror it has to offer.\n\n-Physics\nDem physics doe. Needs a little fine-tuning in places but it works out brilliantly otherwise, and allow for artificial gravity and zero-gravity to happily coexist. Crashes are spectacular, damage from kinetic torpedoes is impressive, and for the non-combat oriented, it's just plain fun to fiddle with the physics in this game. From making orbiting satellites to devising new and innovative ways to send things flying at ludicrous speeds.\n\n-Update speed\nKSH is awesome. They push out updates every Thursday, barring major holidays or a sudden and inexplicable bear assault on their offices. They work hard to keep the game up to snuff and it shows with just how far its come in relatively little time.\n\n-Steam Workshop Integration\nSeriously awesome. Want a mod? Grab it. Want to play with someone's ship? Snag the blueprint. Want a new skybox? Done. New world? Easy peasy. Workshop is an amazing tool and it allows you to very easily - and very rapidly - add new spins on the base game.\n\n-KSH is awesome\nSo good they deserve their own bullet point. These guys work hard, are creative, are pretty honest about where they're at and what's going on, and push out updates and fixes like clockwork. They're enthusiastic about their product, they're in touch with their playerbase, they listen to their playerbase, and they're willing to learn from their mistakes so that they can overcome future hurdles. They're working hard and the game is only getting better with each passing week.\n\nIf you're on the fence about this game, don't be. It's a good, solid title. It has its bugs, yes, it has its glitches and its problems, but they've spent several weeks weeding out the bulk of the problems and it plays pretty smoothly now. There's modding support, multiplayer, survival mode, creative mode, and they're rolling out exploration-oriented content - plus patches every Thursday. Not much beats that.\n\nIf you like  building games, buy it. If you like mining games, buy it. If you like exploring, buy it. Some folks say it's minecraft in space, and in a sense it is. It's virtual legos for sci-fi gamers and hopeful shipbuilders, and it's just flat-out fantastic for it. Strongly, strongly recommended.","December 29, 2014","true","711.6"," 95 of 101 people (94%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","94","95","101","6","1"

To some degree, you need to accept to adapt. If that doesn't work for you, then don't buy this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/midnightwolfie/recommended/244850/","midnightwolfie","MidnightWolfie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/midnightwolfie/","597 products in account","This Review is VERY outdated! This is the review of the game back in December of 2013!\nThank you all for reading!\n\n\nA bit about the game and developers.\nSpace Engineers is a sandbox game about engineering, construction and maintenance of space works. Imagine it as Minecraft in space, where you can fly what ever you build by your own hands. This game is still in a very early Alpha stage, therefore you must know that a lot of things might, and most likely will change. Space Engineers is being developed by Keen Software House, which are the same guys behind Vrage and Miner Wars.\n\nAbout Gameplay.\nAs said above, Space Engineers is something like Minecraft. Currently the game futures only Creative game mode, in which the player has unlimited resources. Player can just open his inventory, put the items into the toolbar and use how he / she wishes to use it. But there is a small twist. This game is not a voxel based game, therefore building something is much harder than most of the other games. You have to turn the object how you see fit. And putting other objects might be a bit hard, since the objects maybe won't be in a good angle.\n\nThere are many various items that you can use to build your small ship, big ship or a station. As it is probably obvious, You can fly small and big ship, but you can't fly a station. And you really wanted to make a huge carrier, didn't you? Well no problem! Just make a massive big ship. Make it so big that it can actually keep other big ships inside of it! Nothing and no one can stop you from doing that! Will it be slow? Of course it will, but you still did it! You can really build what ever type of a space ship or a space station that you wanted to. The game also has a lot of very nice parts that look nice inside of the stations, such as doors or inner walls, etc.\n\nEverything in this game is destructible. And by that, i mean everything that you have built, or your friend. Even if it's an accident, you can't stop it. If your ship is about to crash into a station, you can do your best to evade it but you will most likely fail, and destroy half of the station and the ship. And the amazing thing is that the developers actually put the effort into that! The destructed objects look amazing!\n\nI have to say, this game will have multiplayer in the future. The developers have already confirmed that a long time ago. And I can tell you, the multiplayer of this game is going to be amazing! Imagine four or five player building massive ships and stations. Gosh, I can't wait to do that! Even though the game is in very early alpha, and it really doesn't offer too much to do for now, exploring the current content of the game already showed me that this game has a lot of potential, and that it might actually have a very bright future!\n\nGraphic and Audio\nGraphically speaking the game looks very good, but it's nothing too special. The visual effects of explosions are very good, and destroyed items look amazing. The game's building "blocks" don't look the same. In fact, they are built in a way that they keep "continuing" each other all the time, therefore each part of your ship looks somewhat different. The game also futures coloring, therefore you can have a rainbow ship! Well, you can't really make that but you can try. Music on the other hand isn't anything too special. It's very fun at the beginning, but it gets rather repeatable after a while.\n\nPros, cons and final grade.\nPros:\n- Space sandbox building game.\n- Multiplayer in the future.\n- A lot of different "blocks" with which you can make many, many different ships.\n- Ability to mine through the asteroids and get minerals. We will see what will we be able to use them for in the near future.\n\nCons:\n- Jet pack is very hard to use.\n- Flying anything is very hard, and there is almost no way to stop your ship mid-air. It will keep on flying away.\n\nFinal Grade: 7.5/10\n\nExtra Info: As mentioned earlier, this game looks very promising. I can guarantee that as soon as this game releases multiplayer, it will be much better and much more fun. We just have to wait and see what will the developers do!\n\nAnd also, I wish everyone Happy holidays! Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to everyone!","December 21, 2013","true","18.6"," 227 of 288 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","227","288","0","13"

The game features endless maps which can be customised in many different ways in two different scenarios, creative and survival. Creative mode gives you unlimited numbers of blocks, infinite health and removes some gameplay aspects whereas in survival you have to mine to create your own materials, you can easily die and you have limited inventory space.\n\nWhile this game is great to play with friends it can be a bit boring to play by yourself unless you're very creative so bear that in mind when you purchase it. Also, please note I am capable of commenting on the realism of the game's physics as I study physics and mechanics.\n\n+The physics in motion are good and seem realistic to me\n+Graphics are okay, they aren't the best but they aren't the worst either\n+You have lots of info displayed about your character and your ship (if you are in one) such as mass, speed and fuel left\n+It's a lot of fun to fly around in smaller ships (better handling) and it's also fun when flying in larger ship to crash them in to each other\n+The building system is pretty simple and easy to use once you get the hang of it\n+The multiplayer is good and playing with friends is a blast, until that one friend we all have decides to crash his ship into yours after an hour of building it\n+Lots of hotkeys/controls including one which toggles the HUD, great for taking screenshots\n+Workshop intergration is good and there are a lot of very good mods available\n\n-Momentum doesn't seem right at all, when two objects collide (no matter what the size) a few blocks will break off and some will be crushed/deformed but that's it, the object that crashes into the stationary object will sometimes rebound off of it or they will both remain stationary. From what I know presuming the velocities of the two objects do not cancel (which they cannot in this situation) either one object or both of them should carry on moving, the sum of the two secondary velocities should be the same as there is no friction to take into consideration and the secondary velocities should be in the same ratios as their mass is. (I hope all of this makes sense).\n-With all the controls (I think most keys are used) it is very difficult to get in to and learn and it's also hard to understand some of the different mechanics such as mining\n-The default skybox isn't particularly high quality\n-You can't pause even when playing offline\n-Character animations aren't great and don't look realistic in my opinion\n-The price seems a bit too high for what you get\n\nWorth a mention:\n-The game has long loading times due to the size of the maps and how much stuff is in them\n-If you have a low end PC or Laptop it's unlikely you'll be able to run it, the game slows down a lot when a lot is going on\n\nVerdict:\n7\n\nThis is a good physics based builder despite it's issues that is best enjoyed with a few friends, I'd suggest waiting for this to get a sale before buying.\n\nEl K.","February 17, 2015","true","5.6"," 190 of 240 people (79%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","79","190","240","27","13"

While the Early Access has a lot of bugs, mostly affecting multiplayer, it is still a blast to play building and flying whatever type of ship you want. It has more than just simple building blocks (the default armor blocks) including things like reactors, solar panels, gatling guns, turrets, pistons, rotors, cargo containers, and more - all of which work and have their own functions. Carefully-designed slope blocks allow you to build ships and stations that only look somewhat "blocky", compared to the cubes-only approach of other building games.\n\nSpace Engineers supports mods like nearly no other game does, with the ability to add mods to a server, and have the clients automatically download the same mods from the Steam workshop. Because of this approach, everybody in a multiplayer game runs the same mods, all without an external modding program! So you see Earth in your skybox? So do the other players. Got custom weapons for your ship? So does everybody else. I expect this server-based mod approach to become more common to where it becomes the standard.\n\nFor Early Access, Keen has done an excellent job with updates and hotfixes that come out weekly (on Thursdays), meaning you can log in once a week and see something fresh, as well as see that progress is being made constantly. This shows me they are serious about the game and they aren't going to just shelf this game before release or before it's ready.\n\nWith the update for players to manually control ship turrets, as well as the player-faction features, this game is becoming more and more co-op supportive, where you can control a large ship with multiple players in different roles. Then you could use that ship against other players' crews in PvP, or fight AI once that is implemented (or when mods add AI ships to fight).\n\nSome of the more interesting things you can currently build include: gravity drives, remote-controlled torpedoes, orbital drones, retractable weapons, rotating antenna arrays, giant miners for strip-mining asteroids, detachable countermeasures (decoys), automatically-opening doors (sensors), and escape pods.\n\nOnce they fix the Early Access bugs and add enough features to release out of Early Access, I have a feeling this will be in many top 10 lists of best space games for a long time, if it isn't already.","October 14, 2014","true","207.1"," 86 of 93 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","86","93","0","2"

Looks at hours played... 1,570.2 Hours on record... Yeah, it's okay I guess.\n\nIn all honesty, there are few games that have kept my attention, despite having moments that make me want to flip my desk as well. I'm referring to weekly patches that add new parts, fix bugs, and also break things. It is not uncommon to have a week or so every now and then where I simply cannot play the game at all due to a crash, but usually a week later that crash is fixed and I can play as normal again.\n\nI have played this game for quite some time, so I have seen it progress a lot from the days when it first came out. This is also one of the few games where I both love and loathe the community. While normally not a part of my reviews, with such passionate fans of the game, the community is partially responsible for the direction the game has gone and that means the devs do listen. On the same token, sometimes you wish the devs would stop listening to the community and polish what they have already implemented. Yes, it is Early Access, but at some point you cannot use that as crutch considering it has been 2 years.\n\nOverall, I do recommend this game. While I do have to set it down on occassion, sometimes for a week or more at a time, it is one of those games that every Thursday I watch the patch video, read the notes, and sink a few hours in.","December 12, 2015","true","660.4"," 166 of 207 people (80%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","80","166","207","24","5"

I'm on a tiny, abandoned and crude space station on the side of an asteroid. I have only couple hand tools, no ship, no material for building. Space is vast, I gotta find uranium, fast. This is very scary flying so far off the base with only my jetpack. ..Oh noo some time down the line I lost the signal for the base! I guess meteor storms destroyed it's beacon.. I have no idea where the base is anymore. Forever, lost in space... ✞\n\nDay 2. I woke up in a clumsy landing pod, descending towards some unknown planet. I'm panicking and trying to figure out the controls, finally, I'm almost on the ground,steady now. Wait, what did this button do.. Oh no! Managed to flip the pod right in the last meters, it exploded.. ✞\n\nDay 3. I managed to land my pod, yeah! I don't need my helmet, I can breathe. First steps outside. Hey Idid't know this planet had life, look at those beautiful dogs, what a big pack! Wait, what the, oh for the love of AAAAHHHHHH.. ✞\n\nDay 4. Back to my asteroid station, life on a planet is too hard. Getting my first scouting ship done, with a tiny drill. I coudn't get my reactors working though. Finally, I figured out the uranium couldn't possibly move through the conveyor system to the reactor without any power. Duh! I ripped the side open and added some uranium directly to the reactor. While doing that I noticed that peeping sound I kept hearing, it was becoming more frequent, I don't think it's part of this song coming from the radio afterall. What is it.. AHHH I HAVE NO OXYGE... ✞\n\nDay 5. Note to self, tossing a piece of rock out of the cockpit while flying full speed will effectively break your ship in half and fling you out. I disorientedly watched my ship parts disappear in mere seconds to the vastness of the space.. Not this again. I figured out how to use the GPS system though and found back to my base, as it was conveniently set to be the zero point.\n\nDay 6. I mustered up enough courage to face those vile dogs and decided to try landing one more time. Once on the ground I immediately installed a turret on my landing pod. Ha Ha! Die you %#&* §¤#! Yeah! They aren't so tough after all. Now off to build a base, quickly! Ohhh hey what on earth happened to my jetpacks now, what do you mean NO FUEL?! I'm middle of flying full speeAAHHH... ✞\n\nDay 7. My planet base is coming off nicely, finding ore though is painful. I have no uranium and I don't have lot of energy left. I gotta move my solar panels higher, but I gotta save my last bits of jetpack fuel for dog emergencies. After a lot of work I built two pylons surrounded by scaffolding, and installed a rotor on top of them with solar panels. I have no idea how to program them to follow sun, though.. eventually, I figured out the day length and just gave the rotor a rotating speed divided by day length. Wow, it works!\n\nDay 8. I used last of my spare energy to power up a small car I built. I turned off everything on my base to keep power usage to minimum. The improved solar panels are still barely charging my batteries. I'm only keeping turrets online to protect the base. Ok off to find uranium! Wow this car speeds up really fast. Oops better avoid that tree, hey what the..! Great, now my car is flipped over in middle of nowhere, I gotta figure out how to turn it around, maybe if I built a piston on the side.. OH MY GOD WHERE DID ALL OF THESE DOGS COMEAHHHH.... ✞\n\nDay 9. I spent a lot of time today fiddling around with my tire controls, the car is now more stable. Gotta still drive it carefully though so it wont flip over, but it's good enough. Ha Ha hey ramming those pesky dogs with it deals with them in no time! Take that! I couldn't get a turret to work on my car, but this is maybe even more satisfactory.\n\nDay 10. I found uranium!! It was very deep in the ground, but I managed to dig a steep slope to it and get back up. Digging in the cramp tunnel is scary and disorienting, I often panick when I can't see the exit anymore and loose my sense of direction. Fair enough the dogs didn't figure out how to follow me down there, I guess they aren't as smart as I thought. Finally I got my refiner and assembler working steady with this uranium. And most importantly, fueling my jetpack is not a problem anymore. One spare tank of hydrogen lasts quite a bit, even in this environment. (I carry 5, just to be sure)\n\nDay 11. I started building a massive drilling ship after watching a distant proadcast from another planet. This guy was telling how he made one, it was very inspiring. He said the scraps of the old landing pod that I already disassembled would be plenty to get it going. He was right. Though I've used lot of the parts already for other things, his design is too big. I will make my own, a bit smaller. May take longer, but atleast I will learn better how to do it.\n\nDay 12. My green driller was coming off nicely (I named it Monster), but one of those damned dogs managed to appear from nowhere and hide where the turrets couldn't see it. Before I even realized it managed to chew through the pedestal where I was building my Monster! Karma is a b*tch though, the dog died right after the ship fell on it, ha ha.. Monster is now flipped sideways on the ground. Luckily it didn't break however, atta girl.\n\nDay 13. I finished building Monster, been working whole day to figure out how to flip her heavy frame back the right way. Those small atmospheric thrusters are really weak! 6 of them are not enough to lift Monster even a bit from the ground. ..Ohh great, now I managed to just get her flipped all the way upside down, sheesh. This model has hardly any thrusters downward, I will have to figure out a new approach..\n\nDay 14. I added several big thrusters on the back pointing up (or down, from this angle). Now if I just coordinate this right it might work. First, lifting the backside up from the ground, and add force to nose tilting, yeah it's working! Monster is now wabbling on it's front drills. Now, carefully adding power to the front thrusters to lift it juuust enough to keep it turning back on it's belly with those new thrusters.. Steady, come on big girl.. Wohooo I did it!!\n\nDay 15. I disassembled those extra thrusters from Monster fast, almost panicking. While I was trying to flip her back I managed to get quite far from the base. I was very afraid of those dogs appearing again and destroying my Monster. I had to add one more big thruster pointing down to get her howering easier. Fortunately I got her flying and now Monster is docked safely on the base. It was quite stable to control too, I am happy. Now I am ready to take over this planet! And some day.. Maybe reach that beautiful outer space again ♥\n\nMost. Addictive. Fascinating. Inspiring. Early Acces Game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/f00bar/recommended/244850/","f00bar","f00bar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/f00bar/","270 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI'm giving Space Engineers a marginal thumbs down at this point (October 2014). There's a lot to like, but also a lot of frustration, if you happen to take the game's name at all seriously. As it stands, it's not so much about "engineering" in space as about wartime industry...\n\nAs a sandbox platform, Space Engineers is enormously promising. The construction system is beautifully executed, with a great 'mechanical' feel to it. Harvesting ore, refning and building are great fun. The adjustable pace means you can spend little time grinding, lots of time building. Best of all, the problems of movement in zero-gravity are beautifully solved by an intuitive control system.\n\nUnfortunately, the emphasis in successive updates has gradually shifted almost entirely to PvP - more weapons, more targeting systems, more ways to blow up your friends' bases, and/or defend your own. Obviously, a lot of players are thrilled. But this new direction belies the name "Space Engineers." That name suggests an emphasis on building, and doesn't even hint at destruction or combat.\n\nMeanwhile, the 'adventure' backdrop remains bland and featureless, so there's no incentive to build and explore. Just as you're starting to enjoy the brilliant "space engineering" in this game, you run out of challenges. You really need just one good mining ship and one factory base. All the ore you need can be found just about anywhere. There are no NPCs or mobs. No interesting places to go. No need for shipping, no opportunity for trade, or discovery. No skill tree, or experience to earn. No requirement for food - just metal ore. Not even a need to pressurize your habitats - air isn't a concept, so air-locks just get in the way, and you quickly learn to not bother building them.\n\nTrue, you can go ahead and build fanciful structures in creative mode. But really, they're all going to be either a) space ships or b) space stations. And there's nothing in the environment to create any meaning in any finer distinctions. Larger ships? Why? There's nothing to transport, no place to take it. Scout ships? Why? There's nowhere to go that isn't exactly like where you are already. More elaborate space stations? Why? With no air, you don't really need a closed-in space at all -  a big open platform is far more practical.\n\nI keep hoping that the developers will turn their attention back to sandbox play. Add a few new world types - perhaps with some rare ores that would need searching out. With AI mobs that might randomly challenge your building or defensive ability (without being as wantonly destructive as human players). NPCs that would give you some reason to establish shipping routes, or to build specialized bases and ships. In short, an actual game to make this sandbox come alive.\n\nSo, bottom line, I'm giving Space Engineers a thumbs down at this point. PvP fans can ignore this: go ahead an enjoy blowing up each other's elaborate constructions. It's not my idea of fun, but it seems to amuse quite a few people. I'll keep hoping the developers eventually get back to adding more adventure-type elements, and give me a reason to revise this review.\n\nUPDATE: November 4, 2015\n\nA year has gone by, and Space Engineers is still in Early Access. And I'm still not going to put my thumb up, though it's closer to horizontal than before.\n\nSpace Engineers continues to be a beautifully-designed 'sandbox.' The controls are elegant, the visuals are sharp (especially in DX11 mode), and the construction system is fascinating. The new blocks, the oxygen system, all that stuff is great. But it only makes Space Engineers a great platform for a game, not a game as such.\n\nA 'game' consists of a set of rules and a set of objectives. Space Engineers still has no objectives other than those you set for yourself. Calling Space Engineers a great 'game' is like calling Photoshop a 'work of art,' because it gives you the tools to create an infinite number of works of art.\n\nIt's not just Space Engineers - I have the same complaint about a lot of 'sandbox' products. SimCity could use more-defined goals. But SimCity does create a sense of urgency by forcing players to balance a budget, right from the first moment. Minecraft forces players to find food, to defend against enemies, merely in order to survive. And it offers varied and surprising terrain to explore, both above and below ground. It's that sense of urgency, of discovery, that hooked me on Minecraft, and it's what I still find painfully lacking in Space Engineers.\n\nI'm definitely not saying you can't have a lot of fun with Space Engineers (as long as you don't mind making your own fun). I simply can't recommend Space Engineers as a game, to every unknown person who reads my review. The Steam thumb only has two positions.","October 9, 2014","false","66.4"," 1,165 of 1,643 people (71%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","71","165","1","11","287"

But they aren't right, either.\n\nThe game is in an alpha state, and there WILL be bugs, specially in multiplayer (but that's going to be fixed in about 3 months when new netcode is implemented).\n\nRight now the game is almost feature complete. There is way more things to explore than in other games. You could spend a thousand hours on the game yet you wouldn't explore it fully.\n\nWhat annoys the people and make them post negative reviews are the details. It's true that the game has undergone some reckless patches, without any clear goal (remember they patch the game once a week. That puts big pressure on the devs, needing to release features to keep the community happy), but the new roadmap for 2016 states that things will start to be tidier.\n\nNew models, new textures, new UI.  The game is not going to stay like this forever; it will eventually become and look like a finished game. So although the models aren't that pretty, the features are there, aren't they?\nEven though cargo containers might be ugly modeled, they are functional, and that's what counts.\n\nAbout the "reckless last patches". If you bothered to read, you'd know that the new game netcode is being developed RIGHT NOW, so don't expect big patches unless the netcode is released.\n\nLet me tell you some of the things you have right now at space engineers:\nPistons: Yeah, they are buggy right now IN MULTIPLAYER, but that'll get fixed. In single player they are functional.\n\nRotors: Hanger doors, Robotic arms, hidden turrets, moving platforms...\n\nConveyors: Item sorting, automated power / item transfer between ships...Combine with rotors for epic.\n\nPlanets: Fully moddable planets which add several engineering challenges, such as getting out of the atmosphere of a planet (yes, there is gravity and it's not that easy to get out of the planet, specially in survival), or surviving the long trips between planets.\n\nRemote control and Drones: You can send your ship out of the planet without even being aboard. Obviously, this is not easy to do, and requires engineering (and maybe, programming skills if you want more functionality)\n\nProgrammable Blocks: There is an extensive API out of which you can make automated ship station, item sorters, radars, status reports, cargo managers... Or just display the time in an LCD.\n\nHuge modding community: The developers are also focusing on adding modding support to many areas of the game, and right now there is a bunch of mods that ADD REAL FUNCTIONALITY to the game, plus cosmetic ones that look absolutely amazing.\n\nAwesome ship designs in the Workshop: You can get an idea of what kind of ships you can make taking a look at some designs made by other people. You can recreate ships from films and series, like star wars, or from games like FTL. The game offer great building mechanics that make it suitable for a wide range of styles.\nSo yeah, the game is not BUG FREE, nor FEATURE COMPLETE, but right now it can give you LOTS OF FUN for many hours, and many engineering possibilities with all the mechanisms / machines included currently in the game.\n\nThe only serious con I'd see right now is optimization. Seriously, if you want to play on planets with large ships, be sure to get a high-tier gaming rig. I have a 970 which seems enough for the game, and an i5 (this game is CPU intensive!!)\nThe game will eventually get more and more optimized for less powerful computers whatsoever.\n\nTLDR: Despite all the bugs and placeholder models in the game, it offers many features which are already in the game and WILL give you a lot of fun, specially if you play with friends -expect bugs if you play multiplayer -.\nDon't get scared because of negative reviews. The game right now is just developing new netcode and thus the weekly patches are not AWESOME and they introduce some bugs to the game.\n\n","January 30","true","124.5"," 187 of 244 people (77%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","77","187","244","13","14"

It's a shame that after over 1500 hours in game, I have to shelf my favorite game due to bugs. The devs seem totally clueless as to how to fix the game too as every patch makes it worse and less playable. I've built bases, ships of all sizes, mechs, wheeled vehicles, satellite arrays etc, etc but none of it ever gets used cuz there is nothing to really do in the game. The "pirates" are a joke and the cyber hounds was Keen's way of trolling us for all the harsh criticism, I guess. I really miss the days when I could actually do things with my creations. Now mp is broken af and sp is a glitchy mess. Some optimization is noticeable but after almost three years of development the game looks further from completion than ever. Kudos to the dude that made the Trump ship with the caption "make space engineers great again" lmao...\n\nEdit:\n\nI realized my comment above is not a review and more of a rant so here's a review from a veteran space engineer. Warning: I could write a book about this game lol.\n\nAlone on a desolate planet or out in space, the player assumes the role of some kind of demi God or android able to mine and refine raw materials to use in the building of evermore elaborate machines for the purpose of exploring the cosmos and surviving it's dangers.\nFeatures like terrain deformation, a robust building mechanic and a fun physics engine are the highlights of this gem. However, if you're hoping to get out there as a novice and conquer the universe, I'd better warn you: IT'S NOT EASY MAN. The learning curve is steep as can be since the tutorials are garbage and the UI is a nightmare. But after graduating from the school of hardknocks, a masters from YouTube university and some trial and error, things can be built.\nTime to get creative because it's up to you to figure out from where or how the fun is extracted from this title. It MUST be mentioned that the awesome player community by itself almost makes the game worth buying and is a huge source of fun. With that said, the workshop is your friend, just stay away from mp for now. Trust me.\nBuild a miner ship to dig up ore but it's more trouble than its worth since you can just spawn everything you need for free and there is no persistent story world to make you care about it so unless you're really into drilling for the fun of it...  Build a fleet but you're the only one around so...\nBuild a base but you're the only one around so...\nBuild a massive interplanetary communication satellite array to talk to yourself... (although cameras on satellites is a joy like no other)\nBuild wheeled vehicles that would never pass a road test on earth much less on rough alien terrain. To be fair though, I do have some wheeled vehicles that are quite usable and I even tow trailers loaded with stuff with very mixed results. But you're the only one around so...\nSpend hours building a murder ship only to get murdered by your own base defences during its  first test flight.\nBuild a mech that really works till the next update wrecks everything you thought you knew about gravity and turns your mech into another check in the fail column.\nThe most actual fun I've had here is being a pirate. I raid any bases or ships passing by in space and the in game pirate drones act like the police in my case and try to stop me. They in turn get rekt and looted (a gatling gun, a camera, some skill and you're a killing machine). I usually make it home in one piece but since survival mode isn't very good atm, looting is just for fun.\nThe universe is procedurally generated and rendered beautifully but the game is clearly geared toward building since there is no map, radar, story, npcs or end goals although there is stuff to find out there like ships, bases and hostile drones but they are far and few in between. Also, there is a very crude fps element to the game that is better left unspoken. It's an early access title after all.\nMy advice is wait til this game gains some weight and focuses on what's important or play it in creative mode, learn the ropes, build your heart out and blueprint everything. Some must have mods make the game a lot more enjoyable but any update can break their functionality so keep that in mind.\nGet familiar with some of the dev tools provided like space master, voxel hands and spectator mode and the game will open up to you. Otherwise,  save up for some of the more approachable space sim/ builder games out there.\nIf this review seemed too long or complicated then this game is definitely not for you.\nIt's heart breaking to see that the super complex options and block functions get blamed for the poor performance and dev difficulty but this is why Space Engineers is so great. I fear that future devs will seek to "improve" this concept by simplifying and that's sad indeed. In a perfect world, a full space sim would be a blend of SE and other, more story rich titles like Star Citizen. You gotta at least give Keen credit for trying to tackle this giant by developing a whole engine for it. But that's just my opinion. I state it to point out that the lack of "meat and potatoes" could be this title's undoing, not complexity. I can't imagine any casual gamer bearing through the grind for so little reward though.\nI usually play in survival with very few mods, cyber mutts off and space master on for fun and sometimes play creative mode to build freely. The possibilities are endless but the twisted, explosive will of clang always looms just a connector coupling away...\n\n7/10 Although I wouldn't recommend, I would be disappointed by dizzy devs again and again and again","May 16","false","554.8"," 153 of 197 people (78%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","78","153","197","18","16"

With multiplayer, survival mode, and the endless possibilities in your creations, this game has the potential to rival Minecraft as one of the best voxel sandbox building games.\n\nThe screenshots and videos are deceiving and make the game look much more static than it really is. For some reason, the creators focused more on the ability to crash ships than on how much control you have over creating things. You place every single block on your ship. You can build a ship or station in any shape you could possibly imagine. And then fly them around!\n\nAs I write this on April 6th, 2014, there are some important issues with the game that are worth pointing out to those who are considering the purchase.\n\nEdit: There are now dedicated servers. :)\n#1) There are no dedicated servers for multiplayer yet. This means that most MP servers are at least a little laggy, making certain actions in the game very difficult. Being a more tolerant alpha tester, this has not stopped me from having hours of fun in multiplayer working with other space engineers. If smooth co-op is a must for you, I would wait until dedicated servers are out to consider playing.\n\nEdit: There are now conveyors, connector blocks, merge blocks, vacuumming blocks and debris ejectors. :D\n#2) There are some important blocks and features yet to be implemented to make the game more complete. These include conveyors (due in the next 2-3 weeks), pipes, large ship mining drills, working large ship weapons, factions, and automated defenses. These features are all planned, however, and will allow some fantastic gameplay. Fully automated transferring of resources from your mining ships, natural anti-griefing mechanics with defenses that shoot down anyone not in your faction, and more exciting gameplay when capturing randomly spawned NPC ships.\n\nMy favorite things about this game so far are as follows:\n\nA) Jetpack. I can't tell you how many times I have died in Minecraft from building megastructures. That is not an issue in Space Engineers where jetpacks are part of the vanilla game and even have built-in balancing elements (your suit can run out of energy).\n\nB) Your creations move. I have always dreamed of building a car in Minecraft. Yes, there are mods to do anything, but when comparing the vanilla games, Space Engineers really delivers here. You can already built a huge (and I mean HUGE) ship to carry your refineries, assemblers, cargo, and even a fleet of smaller ships in your hand-built hangars.\n\nThis part of the game is just amazing. In my single-player map, I already have a very simple carrier that acts as a fully-equipped, portable space station complete with landing decks for my mining rig and prototype torpedo bomber. I get goose pimples thinking about how the game will play with dedicated servers, player factions, and screaming, "GET TO YOUR SHIPS" to my buddies as we scramble fighters to respond to a player attack.\n\nC) Extremely high player-impact. This is the main thing I enjoy in any game. In Minecraft, you build your own base, terraform the land, and change the world permanently. Others can come and admire your hard work and creativity. In Space Engineers, all this is true, but you could go as far to make a flying city and bring your creations with you anywhere you go. Make your ships as stylish or as ridiculous as you please, and it will change your experience and the experience of others.\n\nD) Promising update schedule. Every Thursday the devs come out with an update, many of which contain new items and loads of fixes. This will make the alpha testing phase that much more exciting for me and indicates that the game will mature nicely.\n\nConclusion: This game has already earned its keep for me. It has cool physics, encourages player creativity, has the potential for some of the best multiplayer action of any sandbox. It may just rival Minecraft in terms of enjoyment and long-lasting, good memories. I give the alpha version 8.7/10 Prawns, with a few more Prawn-Points depending on what the devs accomplish in the near future.

I bought the game right after multiplayer was released in January 2014. This was before survival was introduced. At the time I was very disheartened by a few bad early access titles that were just disappointing.\n\nI looked into the Miner Wars history of Keen Software House, and decided that - even though that was a kind of flop - this game was worth a look into. Maybe a bit of fun with friends. My dream was always to play a game that let you walk around on small planetoids, building your own stuff. After playing games like Cargo Commander I kinda got into the genre. I played a lot of creative at first with my friends and we built huge ships and had fun gunfights.\nAfter a while, when they got bored and survival got introduced, I found a very nice multiplayer RP server with different factions set up and had the time of my life as a Drone Engineer.\n\nMy opinion of the development and further notes to the multiplayer:\nLet me mention a few things about the development of the game (which after all is very important if you read this).\nI don't know if it was from the point on that I bought the game or shortly after that, but the devs (KSH) promised not to promise any features or announce set dates for certain features and introduced weekly updates. Yeah, that's right, one update to the game every single week. That is features, bugfixes and in addition to that hotfixes for big bugs between updates. For me, this shows dedication. This is the game that let me put trust into early access games again. Simply for that fact I adore it. I have never been as hyped about any game as this, and I played a lot of games. The devs react to feedback very fast, and the community really makes a difference.\n\nAlmost all of the features the game has were suggested at some point by us. Planets, scenarios (with set objectives) and multiplayer improvements are already in the works at the time of this post (you can read that up at Marek Rosas Dev Blog[blog.marekrosa.org] ). At this point I have to mention that multiplayer is playable, but you might want to avoid certain things like landing gears, pistons and rotors on ships for now (perfectly fine on stations) as the netcode can't quite handle the synchronization between clients.\n\nMy opinion of the game / features / options:\nThe game has a very thought through, realistic (Newtonic) look at the Space Survival genre, which I would put this into.\nOne of the things that often get overlooked is the amount of options available. Not only does this game have all the necessary sliders (seperate audio volumes, FOV, maximized borderless window option, ... ), you can completely customize almost every feature ingame. A few of those options are mods (which there are thousands of, from blocks over skyboxes, character models, animations, ship blueprints to custom asteroids and scripts) with full workshop support, but also things like the amount of inventory space, production speed, world size (which by the way is currently able to generate worlds that take about 150 realtime years from the center to traverse at standard speed - which if you don't want can be modified, yay - with randomized asteroids and soon planets).\n\nYou can customize view distance, which makes this playable on pretty old machines, even without the beta optimizations that are about to come in still. (Remember, this is in alpha stage)\nAlso tons of other options that en- or disable all kinds of ingame features, should you want / not want them.\n\nCreative mode:\n- If you play creative you can build whatever you want (from cubes of death to star destroyers, your favourite space station or a small fighter) instantly without needing any resources\n- There is a mirror mode that allows you to build quickly and efficiently with symmetry\n- You can copy paste small parts of a creation (onto other parts if you want) which allows you quick builds with forms and structures you like, which helps a lot if you don't think you are creative enough for a whole big ship\n- You are able to spawn in any ingame object, be it resources, weapons or even whole asteroids\n- Talking about asteroids, there is also a voxel tool which lets you deform asteroids to any shape you want (it also lets you replace materials)\n- There is a blueprint system in place, which lets you transfer projections of the ships you built in creative to survival, which makes rebuilding the thing only a matter of resources and time\n\nSurvival mode:\n- This game is a sandbox game, meaning there is no set objective (yet) to "finishing" the game\n- "Exploration" mode offers almost infinite world generation (as mentioned in the features section) with random encounters which range from small ships, to cruisers or large battleships to stations (most of them created by the community)\n- Survival has a lot of facettes to it that require planning (energy generation, oxygen, storage and production facilities) that may initally seem very complex, but the community is always there to help\n- It is possible to use programming blocks to display things via LCD panels, control stations or ship behaviour (really, almost anything you can imagine, if you get into it, someone for example made an autopilot ship and a customizable interface for pilots that let you see every room status and interact with all the different subsystems, just imagine, you get an enemy player alert in your ship, which then leads to depressurization of rooms, so that your enemies can't breathe there or get sucked out into space)\n- You can create gravity weapons (like a huge space shotgun that shoots out projectiles), gravity drives with artificial mass blocks, which, if correctly done, can get even the biggest and bulkiest ships to maximum speed in a matter of a few seconds\n- But even relatively simple things like building your own mining ship or fighter are highly enjoyable and feel rewarding\n\nFinal thoughts / prospects:\nFor me personally it is enough to gather resources, take over enemy weaponized cargo ships that are floating by and creating awesome stations and battleships, aswell as designing them. But man, this game already offers so much more than that. I have never seen a more polished early access game. From RP mining to dogfights in space or replicating your favourite scene from Star Wars, this game has it all!\n\nCommunity links:The reddit with very important tips in the sidebar, like controls\nThe wiki[www.spaceengineerswiki.com]\nThe official forums[forums.keenswh.com]","April 26, 2015","true","580.6"," 111 of 136 people (82%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","82","111","136","8","8"

You fly them around, you crash them, you marvel at the effects. You experiment with crashing different ships into different other ships at different speeds and angles. You accidentally turn on the gatling turret and wonder wtf happened the first time it shoots your cockpit off your ship. Now you need a new ship.\n\nSo you start to learn how to build your own ships (your first ones will be crap - don't lose heart!) After your first real success, you wonder what the limits are (note: you will run out of ram before the game runs out of program).\n\nThen you find the workshop (this is a good time to have a quick browse) and you realise you've been thinking small.

And multiplayer reminds you that building stuff is fun and all, but when some f***er is trying to blow your stuff up, you tend not to build to super-cool stuff until you've built defenses.

If you can build it, you can rebuild it to be better. The only limit to this game is your imagination (and your PC). Right now it is in Alpha and there are a few kinks that the devs are still working on. Some are major, to be fair. However, they are adament about fixing problems and they clearly have a game plan that they are working with. I'll be honest, I've been frustrated at times with the lack of optimisation at the current build, which does affect playability, as it very clearly says that it will in the Early Access banner above. This doesn't mean that it's a game to be passed up though, to say the very least. The game is in development, and the devs show no signs of slowing down or halting progress on their game.\n\nThe developer involvement in the community is top notch, absolutely excellent. As many other reviewers have stated, Keen Software House is definitely setting the bar for how Early Access games on Steam should be done. Just the other day I posted a bug on their forums, and one of the devs by the name of "Phand" got back to me in 10 minutes. He had me send him my world that I experienced the bug in and forwarded the situation along the appropriate channels. Even if it isn't fixed in this next update, I'm not going to be here complaining because I know it will be as soon as they figure it out.\n\nBut, the devs not only communicate well with the community, they also expand on ideas and are working to make the game better than anyone could have imagined it being six months ago when I first got the game. It has absolutely evolved past what it was at that point and is well worth the asking price. I have bought several copies of this game for friends and have met many excellent builders in the game.\n\nThe UI is a little invasive at times, especially when building something from the inside. But, there are mods for that and I have little doubt that it's not something that the developer has on the to-do list. Speaking of which, if you want something that isn't in the game, you can almost always find a mod for it. The modding community is very talented and there are many coding experts that have developed tools for the game that are available to you for free.\n\nAnd, if you yourself are a coder, check out the programmable block! There is literally a block in the game that you can use C# to program scripts into to execute actions for you on your ship/ station. Not your thing? Or don't know how? Not to worry! You can use scripts from the workshop to make your creation come to life before your very eyes!\n\nWhile the game is no doubt a lot to take in and can be daunting at first glance, the workshop also has examples of ships you can build, and YouTube is littered with in-depth tutorials to get you up to speed. Not to mention the countless guides from the community that explain everything to you in text, if you prefer that to a video.\n\nAll in all, it's a dream come true for someone like myself who spent a lot of time as a kid building Lego space ships. I can't wait for the game to progress further, and it's a very safe bet that it will be the best game of its kind.","March 25, 2015","true","483.1"," 57 of 62 people (92%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","92","57","62","5","0"

At All. This is a game for people who like space, spaceships, engineering, building things and who enjoy problem solving and improving something you have build.\n\nPro's:\n\n-good dev's, passionate community, good updates.\n\n-Very nice graphics, effects need some work but they'll get there.\n\n-the basic game has allot of well thought out, community advised content and possibilities, and then you can easily add the mods in workshop to make the amount of building blocks more or less infinite.\n\nExample: basic game has rotors, pistons, armor blocks, some machines etc, giving you 100's of things to build, the mods add: variations on all that, addapted building blocks, complete overhaul of the "look" of all buildingblocks, completly new angles and shapes to work with, completly new in game mechanics like food and water, looks for your character, new weapons, improved blocks, etc etc.\n\n-Insanely devoted modding community, and they are well heared by the devs.\n\n-very good looking surroundings\n\n-endless spaceships, spacecannon, weapon, base, station, etc etc possibilities\n\n-very fun space battles with your friends\n\n-incredible efficient creative mode that allows multi-spectrum building\n\n-Single player or with friends is AWEsome fun, aswell as creative mode friends, wich is about building stuff to kill eachother :D Creative mod singleplayer is very relaxing and fun if you like builing fast.\n\n-as much game modes possible as you can devise.\n\n-VERY VERY DEPENDABLE UPDATE PROCES (very trustworthy devs) I can not stress this enough.\n\n\nCons:\n\n- very limited survivor aspect atm, building an actual ship is some serious work in survivor mode, taking hours : mining ore, refining ore, processing into components, and assembling them components into the blocks you need. Its fun if you like that sort of thing!\n\n-Again in survivor, but in the game in general: NO enemy, the only real threat in single player is  asteroids and they are not really that fun.\n\n-Only enemy or threat in the game is in multiplayer and this system has been well worked out but is not yet finished imo.\n\n-Very very very grief prone game. One of the things cripling this game is griefers going on servers, crashing ships into other ships people have worked ours on, or just spawning in giant ships to lag up the server and then leave.\n\n-Multiplayer if not with your friends or group is very limited. Take a while to build up stuff and then the server resets, dissapears or someone griefs  your base into the dust, people dont tend to come back after that.\n\n- NO npc's , no quests or happenings (only thing atm is some "ghostship" spaceships you can go chase)\n\n-not much to do in this game outside of building stuff and then using said stuff to build more stuff, for now.\n\n-Bugs, updates, patches, new bugs, alpha!\n\n\nAs long as you like building atleast as much as you like firing space weapons, this is a good game for you, if the dev's stay on track and i'm sure they will, this game has a golden future! If your not into the consequences of an early acces game dont buy it yet but come back in about a year, it will get very good i'm sure.","November 20, 2014","true","681.5"," 56 of 61 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","56","61","0","2"

It is a game of both critical thinking or great fun should you not desire to think critically about your designs, note that it is and will still be fun when you use critical thinking because that is what engineering is about. I have flown hundreds upon hundreds of kilometers and have fought many many fights both on the ground, in a small ship, and in really big ships and I have mined entire asteroids yet I still have not seen the end of creativity and possibility with this game for it is truly limitless from my experience. If you are a person who loves building things and gets a kick from blowing stuff up, then this game is for you, and I promise that you will never regret buying and playing this game, to prove it, I will put one of my experiences below.\n\nOne of the greatest experiences I've ever had while playing this game was in a multiplayer server, people were flying everywhere and fighting, some of them raming, and I had just crashed on an asteroid and had to wait for my friend to pick me up, but he did not know where I was so I had to create a beacon, which I did by taking apart an old station I found inside the asteroid, which sent out a signal saying S.O.S, this not only solved my problem of my friend not being able to find me, but it also created the problem of a bunch of playings humting me down. I was forced to retreat into the asteroid as the barrages of rockets and gunfire came down but I was just setting myself up for a trap, the entire area was closed off and the ships were able to come in, so I grabbed my drill and burrowed into the wall. As the guy was flying towards me, another person came flying in as well and so they started shooting eachothers' ships effectively destroying eachother, once they were done in their little dog fight, I managed to sneak up behind hiw to where I pulled out my assault rifle and shot the cockpit untill it exploded and killed the last guy. My friend had just gotten to the area I was at, so we scaveneged all the parts we could from the wreckage and flew off several kilometers away where we started setting up our main base living happily until a much later point where someone had their faction and came in with like 5 different large ships and totally annihilated it, and so, a new journey of revenge began but with no end. We built a whole field of "magnetic" mines around our new base and waited for someone to come, and they did.","October 16, 2015","true","434.1"," 66 of 77 people (86%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","86","66","77","23","0"

This game has everything and there is always new things to learn.\n\nWhen I first bought this game, a few days back, I was hyped to finally play this game, since I had watched several                             gameplay videos, everyone of them made me more and more interested in playing this game. But when I first launched the game, I was really disappointed, but not in the game - in myself for being so bad at the game. I didn't understand anything, how to mine and how to craft? As usual I skipped the tutorial, and after finding out there was tutorials of the game in the first place, I watched them and slowly started to learn the basics of this game. The game became really fun and I've now played 6 hours in a few days - and there will be more, alot more.\n\nThis game do really have everything, you can build fast spaceships, or if you prefer, build space stations into master pieces. There is a creative mode and a survival mode, like in minecraft, the creative mode you have unlimited resources and you can just fly around and build whatever you want. The survival mode though, is really difficult, atleast to a noob like me, and I recommend you to learn the basics before playing the survival mode, otherwise you might get angry or bored. The survival mode, however is about survive (suprise, huh?) and you have to mine to get the iron before you can craft blocks to build with. Depending which difficulty you play on, there will be meteor attacks, which problably will destroy your station(s) and ship(s).\n\nLike this isn't enough, the game do have an awesome multiplayer mode, were you can just open your offline world to either LAN and/or steam friends and/or to public. The multiplayer mode has great settings, were you can control what the players can do and cannot do. The abilty to mod this game is great, as far as I can tell, there is alot of mods and it's easy to make them and to install them, at the Space Engineers workshop (here at steam) you can download all the mods and worlds others have made, which makes the game even better.\n\nAnyhow, this game becomes funnier the more you learn and the more you play, as you get better - the game becomes funnier. If you do not own this game, but love games involving building and surviving, you should definatly buy this game.","February 19, 2015","true","6.1"," 69 of 84 people (82%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","82","69","84","16","0"

Remember what it was like early in development?  It's come a long way, hasn't it?  Well, Space Engineers is like Minecraft in Space, and it is set for a similarly drastic transformation. Almost every update brings something remarkable and new.\n\nAs of Summer 2014, they still call it an 'alpha', however the game has reached a state where it no longer feels like an unfinished 'work in progress' but more of an already complete and playable game that is still getting constant improvements and additional content from the developers. (Rather like Minecraft this last year or two.)\n\nThe physics are really awesome, crashing two large ships into eachother is sufficiently harrowing to anyone onboard. And I like how all the ship systems work...especially now that they've added the 'conveyor' systems which allow you to connect things like refineries and assemblers (Refineries turn chunks of ore into raw materials, and assemblers craft materials into the components you build with) together, along with cargo holds, so that items are just moved around automatically.  They also added blocks that 'collect' items into the conveyor system, and blocks that 'eject' items from the ship's conveyor system, allowing you to transfer cargo between ships. (Such as having a mining ship dump its ore into a refinery ship that automatically begins processing it, and assembling components from the materials.)\n\nEDIT: Almost right after I wrote this recommendation, an update added the ability for ships to physically 'dock' via a connector on the conveyor system, connecting the two ships' conveyor and electrical subsystems, and allowing control of all ship systems from either vessel. (Also works with ship/station connections)\n\nI also like the progressive construction system. When you go to place a block, it requires one unit of the most basic component; usually something like steel plate, and that creates an empty framework of the block, so you can continue laying out a basic skeleton of what you're building. Then when you go back over it with your welder to actually 'build' the block, it requires the additional components.  Things like motors, steel tubes, 'construction components', computers, etc.\n\nSurvival mode is already full of surprises, considering the fact that there's no AI or anything yet. Recently, I had this incident where I was out mining an asteroid...  I left my ship, my 'mobile base', floating above the light-side of the asteroid, and I ended up mining a deposit on the dark-side...  I get back to the ship and try to open the door...nothing.  That's when I notice none of the thrusters are on; there's no power... I quickly jet over to the other side, and the whole thing's been ripped open like a tin of sardines.  Must've been struck by a couple of micrometeorites...  Reactor was gone, refinery too... Luckily my cargohold was still intact, so I had what I needed to quickly assemble a new reactor.  I had to work fast to get power back on just to recharge my suit before I lost life support... Then the next task was going to be restoring minimal maneuvering to get the thing away from the light-side of the asteroid before there was another meteor shower...  I managed, somehow. Lesson learned; you can bet I never parked in the sun again!\n\nI still haven't played this multiplayer, it would definitely be useful to have people to help build sometimes. Any really large ships or stations are not one-person jobs.","June 24, 2014","true","127.3"," 47 of 51 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","47","51","0","1"

The ones that sucks you in and you notice its 5 am the next day.\n\nI can easilly place this next to Factorio or IC2 from Minecraft. But in space, with physics, and deformable voxel geometry thats not just cubes. Build huge ships, and wage war on multiplayer servers (of which allow it).\n\nI've spent countless of hours building stations and ships, and hosting a dedicated multiplayer server. The fact that you have to build the tools, and automation to build bigger, dig better, and generally make everything less of a chore is a very odd progression element: Of which I oddly enjoy.\n\nNow with the inclusion on random generation and infinite distances, I've enjoyed it even more. You now actually have to try to look around and find your way back to get resources, because not everything spawns on a single Asteroid.\n\nMy only gripe is the fact that the energy mechanic doesnt seem to be enough consitute this as a survivor game, yet its annoying enough to accidentally forget about it until you die and your corpse is floating about with alot of stuff: Meanwhile this isnt much of an issue after you start building ships to handle most of the heavy lifting. Why not also go further that you have to process something to make oxygen or filter CO2, etc and etc. Mods ofcourse can probably do this as well.\n\nThere are still plenty of things I havent experimented with (such as pistons or programmable blocks), but it looks like there is a lot of things you can try to create. I've seen huge projects from a mining beast that carves out a huge round cavern within an asteroid (leaving only a shell and a tiny entrence making a great asteroid for a base), to smaller utility ships that can be converted to fighters, welders or miners.\n\nI can easily recommend this game to anyone who loves building (engineering), creatively experimenting with creation of various tools / weapons (in the form of ships). Just be prepared to spend lots of hours, especially if your are into creating automation.","January 18, 2015","true","204.8"," 43 of 47 people (91%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","91","43","47","6","0"

That is open to speculation). In other words, cut them some slack.\n\nThis game is EXTREMELY GPU and RAM intensive, i do not suggest running it with less than 8gbs, (16 recommended). Also bear in mind that some planets will refuse to load on low end GPUs and that others will run badly. For example you will run Mars at 30 odd fps on a GTX 750ti, 50-60 on a 980. Earth and the alien planet will run at 50-60 fps on a GTX 980ti (basically a titan x with less vram). I also hear that AMD cards and CPUs run worse than their Intel and Nvidia counterparts, though this is inconsitant.\n\nAs such i STRONGLY suggest you stay away from planets if you have a weaker GPU, i can manage 40fps on intel integrated graphics in space.\n\nMultiplayer is currently broken, though new netcode is on the way and indications are that it is nearly complete. Stay away from dedicated servers until it drops, private games with 2-6 people run perfectly fine for the most part, though i do not recommend using pistons and rotors, they will invoke to wrath of Clang (the patron god of Space engineers and utter ruin).\n\nThat just about covers it for the warning, i will add more as i either remember things or otherwise find out more.\n\n---------------------\n\nNow, for the actual review.\n\nSpace engineers is a semi realistic sci-fact voxel based building and exploration game (emphasis on the building part).\nIn this game you will build, mine and fight pirates (single player) and other players (multiplayer) in the hope of creating massive battleships to oppress the peasants, and defend what you own.\n\nYou can build basically any ship from movies, other games and TV series, or something original (but mostly you will end up building flying bricks due to your lack of aesthetic skill), the only limits are your imagination, and your computer.\n\nMining for resources is actually very fun in this game due to deformable terrain.\n\nThe fighting part could use a little work, but it does the job fine for the moment.\n\nThe exploration element is similar (if not somewhat superior) to that found in Elite: Dangerous, difference being the main reasons are to find a nice looking place for a base, look for resources, or if you have both, look for the community made ships that are placed extremely infrequently across the galaxy. Rather than just to have your name on a planet, though you can do that too if you really want.\n\nThe UI is, to be honest a little daunting at first, but it does the job.\n\nThe graphics are some of the best in the genre, and the models and effects are currantly being improved.\n\nThe music is decent (love the title screen song), but after a while you get a little tired of it.\n\nThe modding community is absolutely fantastic, on par if not better than the Skyrim one.\n\nInfact the community in general is superb for the most part. Probably the best i have found yet.\n\nThe game is updated every week on thursday, and hotfixes released as soon as they are finished.\n\nYoutubers for this game in general are great, i suggest VideoSage, XP gamers and W4stedspace.\n\nThat about covers it for the review.\n\nTL;DR To me this game is fantastic and has the potential to be even better, and it looks like the devs are going to deliver.\n\n8.5/10\n\nEdit: Before putting a dislike in, make a comment so I know what you disagree on and how i can help fix it.","May 21","true","126.8"," 60 of 74 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","60","74","3","18"

But, what a sandbox!!! While it may seem very similar to Minecraft in essence, Space Engineers holds its own thanks to a few unique aspects:\n* SPACE! Building your own spaceship or station then go fight or race with friends is truly a thrill! Especially when creative mode offers a well-thought interface (although there would still be a few improvments to make, like a larger number of toolbars).\n* Physics! Well, it's a very similar point. Still, beyond the basics of space navigation, the included mechanics such as rotors, pistons and sensors allow wanabee inventors to (re)create astucious machineries to give some automated glory to your creations!\n* MODS! This game has been designed from the get-go to be easily modifiable, and the recent addition of ships/stations blueprints really amps the game! Between reconstruction of famous spaceships, tricky mechanics or slick self-made models, you really can spend hours just trying everything -or designing the next most popular ship on the Workshop!\n\nSo, is this game a true gem, without flaws? Unfortunately, no.\n1. This game is a resource-hog! It is very CPU demanding and can put down even quad-core if you get a bit heavy on blocks and interactions (it fully crashed my computer once when I fought with friends between half a dozen ships).\nWhile it's partially explained by the richness of interactions and creativity, everything cannot be overlooked.\nIf your computer is more than 2 years old, unless it was high-end at the time you won't enjoy it fully.\n2. Survival is basically boring for now. Only difference with creative is occasional meteor showers, keeping an eye on your internal battery, and SPENDING TWO HOURS JUST TO BUILD A SMALL SHIP ! 'Cause you'll have to drill, build a refinery, drill rare minerals, refine them, order component manufacturing and assemble them, and EVERY STEP IS RIDICULOUSLY SLOW! So unless you start in "scenarii" it's just an uninteresting waste of time...

(If you are patient/cautious, wait until it goes on sale.).\n\nSpace engineers is a block based building game, often described as minecraft in space, but with more realistic looks and physics. (Disclaimer: I have never played Minecraft because it is not in space.)\n\nIt has a creative mode, where you can comfortably just build spaceships (or bases, or vehicles) and a survival mode, where you need to mine and refine ore from asteroids or planets before you can expand beyond your starter-ship. In survival, you also need to generate energy and (unless you turn that option off) oxygen. Either way you get to build your own ship from hull to windows, doors, thrusters, gyros, antennas, refineries, cargo containers, fuel tanks, air vents, conveyors, batteries, missile launchers, landing gears (or wheels), cameras, sensors, timers, script blocks and more. Then you can fly your spaceship in an asteroid field, land on planets, set up bases, mine ores, fight pirates... Space Engineers is a sandbox game, so beyond not dying you have to set your own goals.\n\nOf course you can save the ships you have built as blueprints and upload them to the workshop or download ships built by other players. There are some fantastic creations on the workshop. Actually, if you are interested in this game at all, I recommend you just take a quick look around the workshop to see what can currently be done in Space Engineers.\n\nSpace engineers is early access and still in alpha. The developers update the game every single thursday. That update will fix some things, add some things and, inevitably in this stage, break some things. Be sure to report bugs - that is what early access is for. The devs do a hotfix every friday, so that you can enjoy the game better over the weekend.\n\nWhile the devs listen to the community - they added planets by popular demand - they have been too silent in the past. They are making an effort to improve, though.\n\nBeing alpha, the game is hardly optimzed yet, even though the devs work on that week by week, too. Older rigs may struggle with it. Performance in Singleplayer can be improved with the right settings and good judgement. Multiplayer however is currently being completely redone and perfomance varies from week to week.","April 8","true","789.6"," 47 of 57 people (82%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","82","47","57","9","3"

The Building part is super fun. The Resource gathering is interesting because you build your own ships for the Job.\nOn the other hand, the lack of content besides building and gathering can make this game pretty boring pretty fast.\nInterested in building cool spaceships or a moon base?

But, as other early access titles, there's always a shadow looming over any potentially great title: the direction its developer will take, and how they will react to an unexpected success. I loved this game back when it was... simpler. Not in its mechanics, mind you, but in its SCOPE. It was a game in which you had to hone your space engineering skills (hence the name) to make better designs, and when you managed to build a well-designed, perfectly working ship... it was glorious. I remember how proud I was of the first semi-automated mining ship I built, the smile on my face brought me back 20 years, when I was a kid playing lego and building something I liked.\n\nThen Keen Software House was hit by a wave of... success. They tried their best with their weekly update, and for some time I thought they were going in the right direction, with them adding programmable blocks and more engineering solutions to the already rich plate. Then they started trying to please everyone. Adding things most players didn't even want, failing to fix GAME BREAKING bugs, ignoring the pathetic state the multiplayer is in (completely unplayable as of now, has been like this for months).\n\nThen the dreaded PLANETS. I won't lie, I was looking forward to them. But the engine showed the game itself wasn't ready for them, and they even changed the damn system requirements after adding that feature. Fact is, even with a mid to high-end gaming pc you won't be able to reach playable frame rates. I'm using a good machine myself, and my fps (10 to 20) on planet surfaces makes the game completely unplayable. And the bugs and unneeded features just keep coming.\n\nWe have exploding CYBERDOGS now, yey, and we can mod our medical room to suit our playing stile, imagine what kind of funny stuff we could do in multiplayer - oh wait... the multiplayer is currently broken. Keen is losing sight of their own creation, trying to subtly invite us to polish the game for them via MODS... their vision of this game's future is clouded by their own inadequacy.\n\nI would NOT recommend this game to anyone right now, and I fear this might not change in the future, since the company behind it is quickly losing any credibility as a serious developer. If you're really interested in this title... well, my suggestion would be to wait. Wait and see if they can (and want to) come up with solutions to this game's long standing bugs (mining not working properly, terrible sim speed, unacceptable optimization, unplayable multiplayer) and make the right steps in order to keep the title alive. If so, I'd gladly change my review at a later date. But right now... avoid this game. It will make you think "this could have been GREAT, when and how did it go so wrong?".","January 7","false","853.1"," 317 of 503 people (63%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","63","317","503","22","47"

What is it? Imagine Minecraft having kids with space with difficulty surpassing all other games you have ever played and great modding potential. Maybe I'm overexaggerating because the game isn't that hard when you disable some stuff but trying to capture a cargo ship with automated turrets with your little fighter is hard and the space doesn't forgive. If you get shot and die it's not minecraft your stuff is gone for good and you'll not find it unless it's stationary or marked, or going really slow for some reason. You have to menage your resources well and pick your fights if you plan on fighting. There are also pirates that sometimes spawn and you have to attack their base or they'll keep sending drones and some alien NPCs like big spiders and cyberhounds. The game is updated every week and it's amazing that developers DO care. You can create a lot of different stuff in Space Engineers and you can even code in game. Space Engineers is all about usability of your creations but it doesn't stop you from building 1:1 Death Star with empty interior, it's just not as fun in my eyes as making something more... technical.\n\nControls might be confusing at first but you can remap 95% of stuff and it's great. The game has a lot of tutorials but I've never played them since I bought the game years prior to tutorials and simply watched update videos to learn the game.\nYou can play either Survival, Creative or some workshop scenarios. All modes are great. I love spawning planets in Creative with different seeds, they're so sexy, mrrr. Survival is really, really great and it has been greatly improved since I first bought into the game and made more accessible and faster for single player. Multiplayer is loads of fun and I recommend you bring friends if you plan on playing Survival because it's the best thing to do in the game. Graphics vary but there are some really cool solutions in here and it's not Minecraft level of graphics, this isn't square world - only the blocks are square 100%, destruction of ships is really great and blocks do not destroy instantly like said MC - destruction looks very real and ramming mothership with other mothership into a side is fu**ing omhack fapfapfap.\n\nI really enjoy the soundtrack. Both battle music and the slower pace tunes are good.\nThe game truly has a lot to offer and you can build a lot of different vehicles or even make a small ship into a guided rocket or a turret. The game is still a little bit buggy but recent updates are all about bugfixes and optimization.\nOn the topic of optimization it's not really that great but it's hard to tell why. It's just not always good but even in world with 25 planets I'm k but when I eg. land on a planet or spawn a really big fu**ing ship then it might not be as good. And I have a very good PC soo yea it's sad. The game is loads of fun alone or with friends, creative or survival, map making or building sh*t, fighting with motherships or raiding an NPC vessel with fighters. I recommend you support the devs, the game is really worth it even though it's not perfect. Remember, you can only play planets if your video card supports DX11. Otherwise the game is playable in DX9.\n\nThe Dark Souls sandbox in space with great modding support I've always wanted\n96/100.\n\n+ for:\nCustomizability\nLots of options to create advanced mechanisms\nMultiplayer, SP, Creative, Sandbox, Scenario mode (community made maps/vanilla maps/map making)\nSoundtrack\nPlanets are stunning to look at\nThe game is fair but hard if you want it to be\nGreat modding support\nWeekly updates that do indeed add stuff and fix stuff (progress of the game)\nPhysics (destruction and all the other stuff that makes the game more difficult to build vehicles capable of flying above planet's surface etc. it's all so cooool)\nYou can make everything out of this game\nVery tactical with where you set up your base to defend it more easily and to avoid meteor storms, battling cargo ships, managing resources and trying to stay alive and with oxygen etc. (unless you turn these features off)\n\n- for:\nOptimization (big -)\nSome major Scenario features I'd love to see there are still missing\nMultiplayer code isn't as great as it could've been\nThey deleted ladders years ago and they're out of the game since then... guys give up with your gravity elevators and stairs we just want fricking ladders.\nCrashes (sometimes)\nNo water on planets (only ice)\nThis isn't a great FPS regardless of having Assault Rifles (lackluster shooting with your astronaut/space engineer altough still being worked on and it keeps getting better)\n\nThe money you invest now is the money you'll get back in fun time pretty quickly and even more money over time since with each update game becomes more expensive and it's getting better and better so it's definetely worth to buy it because it's 99/100 material and 100/100 if they CAN and WILL MANAGE to make the optimization great.\n\n","March 8","true","197.9"," 39 of 47 people (83%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","83","39","47","4","1"

On one hand there are things about this game that are amazing, which I get excited about, on the other hand I find there are just so many problems and bugs which are holding the game back.\n\nI'll start with the negatives. This game is very poorly optimised. I know this game has a lot to render, but the framerate on planets is less than satisfactory even with a reasonably strong PC running on low settings. Planets offer the most interesting gameplay currently, so it's a shame to have to deal with this issue. (I do understand this is an early access game, and optimisation usually comes later in the development cycle, I'm merely commenting on the current state of the game). I usually play on a private server with a small group of friends. During our time playing we have encountered a variety of bugs and frustrations. One of the worst was after a few days building a station on a planet, it decided to flip, damaging or destroying much of our work. This was immensely frustrating, especially as we were also dealing with occasional crashes to both client and server. We also had issues with turrets targeting dogs and just shooting our station instead, causing damage. Not to mention the dogs themselves, which seem to spawn randomly and appear with not much warning. They seem very simple and could do with work. I also find the UI to be a but clunky, but that may be more down to personal preference.\n\nThat aside, this game has a lot of very nice features. The planets are huge and impressive to see, even though they haven't been in the game too long. The physics in the game is good and the technical side to building ships and stations has plenty of depth, whilst still leaving room for creativity. The resource gathering system is cool too, starting with basic hand drills, up to large mining ships, there is really no limit to how far you can go with this game, as long as you have the time.\n\nIn summary, this game has plenty of impressive core features but is plagued by frustrating bugs, features and poor optimisation which are currently holding it back. I am highly confident this game will be an amazing experience at some point in the future, but a little patience may be required.\n\nPros:\n-Planets\n-Good physics\n-Good ship/station building mechanics\n-Mining\n\nCons:\n-Bugs, some severe\n-Crashes\n-Dogs are a bit simple\n-Poor optimisation\n\nFinal verdict:\n4.9/10\nMaybe pick it up on sale to give it a test, otherwise stay patient maybe until it comes out of early access.\n\n~edited to fix a few spelling errors","March 11","false","51.0"," 221 of 351 people (63%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","63","221","351","12","46"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/244850/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSpace Engineers is a sandbox game about construction, engineering, and maintenance of objects in space. This includes small ships, large ships, space stations, and platforms. It features a simple crafting system, jetpacks, survival and creative modes, as well as multiplayer! Space Engineers is developed by Keen Software House,  the same team behind Miner Wars.\n\nThe game revolves around the player collecting resources from the asteroids and rocks floating out in space. To reach them you can utilize either a ship you've built (or started with) or your trusty jetpack. Once you've reached a location, you can then scout out materials and begin mining them. Once you have sufficient resources, you can then craft things such as a cockpit, thrusters, a gyroscope, a gravity generator, and reactors...all of which are required for building a ship. Multiplayer can be quite challenging, as it will have you coordinating with other players to build large stations and ships for moving and storing items as you establish a base of operations and then go out and find new sources of ore and materials.\n\nEverything in this game is destructible. And I mean EVERYTHING. What you've built, what your friend has built....even your friend! If your ship is about to crash into a station, you can do your best to evade but you will most likely fail, and destroy half of the station AND the ship. And the thing is that the developers actually put the effort into that! The destructed objects look very realistic and look like they had some thought put into hnow they would look if destroyed a certain way (Rammed by a ship for example)! Fly a ship into another ship and check it out. Broken objects, pieces of metal, and more will all be floating away through space after a stellar impact.\n\nSpace Engineers is currently still in Alpha, and is available on Steam via the Early Access program. While it is still very early in its life, Space Engineers is very playable, and a blast to play with a few friends. Get a few together, grab a four-pack of the game, and you will definitely get share of fun from this game.\n\nRecommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","November 1, 2014","true","23.4"," 50 of 67 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","50","67","0","0"

I remember when Workshop integration was added, within days there were tens of THOUSANDS of worlds on the workshop. And when official modding was introduced, the community (and myself) went absolutely CRAZY! Modding opened up whole new worlds (sometimes literally) for this game. Also, I find myself enjoying the multiplayer a LOT more (screw you rammers, though) simply because of the numerous fixes and improvements they've made to it. Even now, this is one of the few games I would've payed the usual 50-60$ for, but it's a steal at only 20$. And the devs! Keen Software House have to some of the most dedicated game developers I've ever seen, releasing content-filled updates EVERY THURSDAY since launch, never missing one. I heard recently that this game is also going to be in retail stores and for download on the Xbox One. Now, if you can get your game on that big of a platform, you're doing something right.\nI really can't wait to see where the future takes this game and KSH.\nSo, overall, 12/10","December 4, 2014","true","626.2"," 29 of 32 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","29","32","0","0"

How do you go against that?\n\nWell, here's how I do it.\n\nSpace Engineers is a fantastic game if you're prepared to play a local, single player game. It works quite well, with only a reasonably small amount of bugs for an Alpha game.\n\nSpace Engineers is a terrible game if you'd like to play a dedicated server, multiplayer game. It barely works, with a large array of game breaking bugs for an Alpha game. Furthermore, some deliberate design decisions by Keen will ensure that sooner or later, entire ships, cargo and inventory are lost, and done so on a regular basis.\n\nOverall, I'd really like to like this game - and if playing forever by myself was an option, I reckon I'd love it. However, until the cheap and fatally flawed multiplayer code can be fixed (or completely dumped and replaced with something that works) and until some key design decisions can be reversed that stop penalising players for the frequent disconnections induced by said multiplayer code, this is a game whose multiplayer capabilities are best expressed in abstract terms only.","March 20","false","532.4"," 231 of 373 people (62%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","62","231","373","19","56"

I'm a huge Minecraft fan and always wanted something that looked a bit better and gave me even more freedom. I found that with Space Engineers. The building system is great and the mod support is epic! There are so many things that can be build within the game and using added mods. I regularly play with 100+ mods added to the game.\n\nNow, with the added planetary support, it has just become my favorite game. I never really get tired of playing this game. It's an awesome builder with a dev team that really enjoys what they are doing with the game.\n\nThe only downside to the game is it's graphics compatibility issues. It seems that every other update breaks lighting or voxel viewing. That can pose an issue when float through space and you smash into invisible asteroids or when you are deep in a mine on a planet and your helmet lights only half work.

Although it's not yet fully released, it already features a great deal of content.\nIf this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.\n\nNote: I played this game when I was on vacation with no internet so playtime and achievements were not registered for some reason. It was a nice vacation, though.\nWhat is happening in the game:People would tell you that it's basically Minecraft in space and they wouldn't be wrong. You can build ships and bases, fly around and mine. What to do in the game is basically your choice, as in all sandbox games.\n\nPros:    There are both survival and creative mode. As you can assume, creative mode is for creating, without any real danger you would need to deal with. Survival mode, on the other hand, need a bit more skill when playing, as you have to be careful not to die or lose the energy, there are meteor showers ...\nOf of the best things in the game is Workshop integration. With 120k+ user-created items submitted, it is obvious that the game is fun enough for that many gamers to post their own creations. There is everything: ships, characters, asteroids ... you name it.\nA pretty good tutorial introduces you nicely to many features in the game, even the basic movement ones, if you've never played any games before.\nSome reviews say that this game is abandoned by the developer, however, there are regular updates coming out about twice a month.\nEven though I'm pretty sure it's not very realistic, it still gives the impression of being like that. Space battles and stuff like that is of course not transferred from the real life, but other content might very well be.\nA part I'm very thrilled about is in-game programming. You use C# language to write scripts.\nFor a game in Early Access there is a ton of content and things to do. Reminded me of Prison Architect. Impressive.\nCons:    The price is pretty high for an Early Access game. You should at least put the price a bit lower for the testers! It is true, however, that this game has been bundled twice already (at the time of writing this review).\nBuilding stuff takes a long time, ruining it takes seconds. There is Workshop for the lazy people, though.\nDespite having relatively low system requirements, this game runs slower than it should. I believe they're going to fix that before they get out of Early Access.\nNo Linux and MacOS support. I am not familiar with what engine they're using for this game, but most modern ones support other platforms than Windows.\nThe final verdict:If you are one of the people who love sandbox games (not everybody do), you should consider getting this game. Even though it's in EA, it has tons of content, Workshop support for a few more tons of content and more features will be coming with future updates. The game is fun, not that buggy and it includes both creative and survival mode.\nI've played Space Engineers a lot already, some people even spent hundreds of hours on it, in case you're worried about how many hours this games can offer.\nFor people who like sandboxes, this is certainly a recommended game.\n\nFurther reading:    Store page\nFeatures[www.spaceengineersgame.com]\nSpace Engineers Wiki[www.spaceengineerswiki.com]\nGameplay on Youtube\nGreetings,\nBirdCute\n\nNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes.

It is in Early Access game with quite a bit of content and more is being added on constantly.\n\nWhat is in the game?\nThis is an open sandbox game with lots to explore, it is not your typical sandbox game, it is a unique sandbox-space game. There is lots to do, you can build spaceships, explore outerspace, build space stations, have ship fights with friends in your almost fully destrutible enviroment.\n\n\nIs this game worth the money? Personally I think it is worth it, there is so much to do in this game, there is two game modes, Survival and Creative. Pretty self explanatory but Survival is where you are trying to gather your supplies and trying to survive and create your spacestation, but in creative you get to create your own spaceship or spacestation or whatever you want to make with all the tools at your fingertips.\nYes the game is a bit expensive 25$ at the moment, it did go up recently from 20$ if you dont want to spend that much then just wait for a sale when it will be much cheaper.\nThe game is fun but even more fun with some friends to mess around with.\n\nPros Huge Workshop, there are over 150 thousand workshop submissions from Spacestations, Spaceships, and all kinds of machines.\nRegular updates to the games, some great devolopers working on this game they update 1-2 times a month.\nGreat game there is so much to do, you can have huge space battles with friends, build an army of spaceships, have races in fast spaceships, build a deathstar.\nThere is a great high detailed tutorial that helps you figure out this game which can be pretty complicated at first.\n\nCons\nAgain this game is a bit expensive, 25$ is quite expensive for some people but it does go on sale and when it does you should get yourself a copy and maybe one for a friend.\nThe controls for flying ships are a bit hard but once you get used to them it becomes more enjoyable.\nIt does take a while to build stuff and can be challenging and frustrating when a friend or someone or even yourself destroys your creation in a matter of seconds\n\nMy final thoughts and opinion of Space EngineersThis game is still in Early Access and is one of the better sandbox games i have seen and played so far. There is 100s of hours of gameplay to offer and maybe even thousands. There is plenty of mods to try out and play. There isnt very many gamebreaking bugs (or none that i have found or heard of) but the developers are always updating and patching bugs. This is a great game for early access and i am excited to see what is to come later, i highly recommend this game to fans of sandbox games, and fans of building games.","September 16, 2015","true","3.5"," 44 of 60 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","44","60","3","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/g4borg/recommended/244850/","g4borg","G4bOrg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/g4borg/","59 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nMinecraft in Space?\nIt is not Minecraft, but it has similarities, being a grid based game (often called voxel); however your grids form their own "objects" making it possible to smash those grids against each other and watch havok deform the material, and spaceships create awesome wrecks.\n\nThe Creative Solo Player\nWith multiple ways to achieve your results, you will quickly see the creative part of the game becomes the first magnet. Designing your own stuff is easy there, weapons do not require ammo to fire, blocks are buildable fast.\n\nYou can use mirroring to build faster, modify the level to your liking by deforming asteroids or placing objects, copy and paste parts on each other, use all kinds of mechanical parts, or a programming block to create whatever you imagine. But the biggest fun is to actually design in creative, save it as a blueprint, and rebuild it in survival conditions, or use your own spaceship design in a custom match.\n\nCreative gives you all the abilities to get to know the game engine. Not everything you can play in singleplayer will make a lot of sense in multiplayer, and you can create abonimations like life sized ships, use thousands of mods to make them beautiful and even host it for a few players to look around.\n\nSurvival\nSurvival is the basic new trend in sandbox games, once you learn how to survive, you also learn how resources are limited, and how the players are balanced in a MP setting. Surviving in space needs energy and oxygen atm. - you need to mine asteroids, refine the materials, build new materials, and each component you would build in creative with a click needs a lot more work.\n\nSince you can die, or stuff which explodes might be lost, your energy might run out, or your oxygen, survival gives it's own long term struggles, but does not really hinder you to establish yourself, and concentrate on tasks at hand.\n\nTherefore the refining and assembling is not as complicated as in games dedicated to this, but still complicated enough that a question which you never asked yourself suddenly pops up, and makes you realize, your current design philosophy with all its glory has also its weaknesses.\n\nThere is little more to say, it's only a step, if you cannot entertain yourself, you might want more... so more to come...\n\nScenarios\nAtm. introduced, scenarios and modding are a big focus of Keen. Designing your own level, like it's a game within a game, and playing it with friends, or publishing it and become famous on workshop are their own achievement. However, be warned, this part of the game is still under construction.\n\nThe Space MMO dream?\nWith the coming introduction of planets, the introduction a new rewritten netcode, and the developers going public with sourcecode (so you can help fix bugs or have it easier to create mods on github), and also the efforts in AI "research" from the publisher, it seems clear, that sandbox worlds are a dream of the dev team, aswell as the player base.\n\nCurrently however, you should not expect a full online game experience.\n\nCurrent state critique\nI have little critique. It is the first C# app, I do not dismiss, simply because it's written in a virtual machine language, something I do not want game engines written in personally; I can see a lot of struggles ahead for the devs, but they seem keen (pun intended) on facing those obstacles. I can only say, if they keep up their energy, and dedication, this game will slowly evolve into an absolute classic. That said, it runs well, but of course also eats resources, if you give it more. Like basicly every physics game; graphics and effects are decent, as is FPS.\n\nThis being said, it's of course directx only, so windows/xbox based, with still a rudimentary hackish netcode, and no sandbox servers, database stuff etc, and especially not for linux, to make it really able to create medium sized communities for your own "little spacegame". There are servers which try to make larger games than 4-6 players possible, but actually, it is not something you want to play now. However, since there is much to do until that is all ready, and still core features to come, I would hop on now, than later; it is more than worth it's money in fun, and offers you especially if you have a geeky heart or a fable for lego or lego technic, a lot, especially if you like to invest time "behind the game".\n\nIt is also great for kids, since the game does not focus on violence, much less than minecraft anyway, while it also does not completely "conceal its possibility".\n\nHave I said, that you can smash ships you built with copy paste to see them explode? This should be all the arguments you need. If you quickly want to do something in a virtual world, this is one of the most ideal games for it. You might even just build a conference center for youtube videos or create machinimas with it - if you are the creative player, who wants to design, this game is already in a very finished state. For everyone who waits for the online experience, I can understand if it stays on the whishlist. But definitely, it deserves a spot there.","June 22, 2015","true","564.0"," 32 of 40 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","32","40","0","0"

It tests my creativity to come up with functional and aesthetic design, but the end result is more than worth it.\n\nThe game definitely has more than it's fair share of bugs, however. Optimization is poor at best, and there are multiple game crashing bugs that I run into regularly.\n\nThat having been said, the developers have put in a staggering number of new features since the game was released, including the MASSIVE and game changing Planets update that was never even initially planned. And the last month or so, they have focused exclusively on bug fixing and it's really starting to show.\n\nOverall, the game has issues that I would consider unplayable in MOST games.

It was the foundations from which I wanted to become a game developer and 3D artist. And I have seen it grow since it's inception.\nThere are very good reasons why this game is as highly rated and prized for it's gameplay and development, and also as much reasons why it is still following the early access model.\nAs I am writing this, it has been a few months since I had a long session of building and interacting with the community. The long hours I made in this game and the great people I met on the workshop and forums are the reasons I am still coming back. This game is a timesink, but the reasons why you play differ per player. I am of the creative sorts and love sharing my creations on the workshop. Others may jump into a survival server and love the interaction and building together with friends or anyone at all.\nThe game has a solid foundation, with a lot of potential, yet a lack of polish. That is now written of as 'early access' yet it also seems that the focus of SE lies on the core mechanics, and allowing their players and dedicated modders to expand on the assets, code and additional features one would find in competitor games.\n\nI myself have never indulged myself in the survival and multiplayer scene in the way SE presents it to their players. I prefer working in self made scenarios and creating the sandbox environment as a filming studio. Making machinimas or just a show and tell.\n\nI have had a blast with this game, yet sometimes you need a break to rewind your creative gears. I have had a break of a few months before, and when my time is plenty again, I will definitely get back building!\n\nPros\nUnique physics and deformation engine\nContinues updates and community feedback\nUnlimited value if you are into sandbox games and space. (2000 hrs and counting)\nMultiplayer\nModding support.\nMany other things.\n\nCons\nTerrible User interface\nLack of Polish in models, characters, variety and depth of existing game elements\nA lot of work arounds and limitations in gameplay. In the form of artificial maximum speeds and stopping physics calculations at certain speeds.\nMultiplayer is not reliable (Netcode is not done on the moment of writing this)\nMany other things aswell halas.\n\nFinal Verdict\nIt is a platfrom perfect to continue your creativity and physics nonsense you expect from other sandbox games.

There are so many bugs that can break the game, like flying through a solid asteroid, mining into a planet, or just multiplayer bugs in general\n\nSo you're wondering why I don't recommend it.

It is basically like half a Minecraft in space, just without the long-term entertainment and reasonable multiplayer.\n\nOn the other hand the game is so full of bugs right now, that playing is painful. Crashes, safe-file corruptions, they got it all. Multiplayer has been neglected for years now and unless you like playing on servers with 5 fps that crash every 20 minutes it's just not fun at all.\n\nKSH releases an update every Thursday with incredible updates like "Planets now have more stones, and some of them contain ore." At KSH this is the result of a full week of work. Oh and also they add bug-fixes to the changelog, but that doesn't mean that those bugs are fixed, just that it says so in the changelog. And they add new bugs to the list, game-breaking ones that everyone who tested the game for at least five minutes would have noticed, but obviously KSH does no testing at all.\n\nSince the source code is available on GitHub it is painfully clear that KSH has basically no idea how to make a game, or to code. For example every random coder that does Minecraft mods gets a power system right, KSH doesn't manage to do that in month.

Lets keep this linear and within the bounds of reason. The personal attacks are just further adding to the demise of this game by demonstrating the childish attitudes of the current players.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMore in depth explanations of KeenSWH's delinquency and history or non-completion of products from a fellow SE Player: http://levitatorthe.blogspot.ca/2016/01/management-issues.html\n\nAnd KeenSWH's previous grand-failure:\nhttp://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-01-07-miner-wars-2081-review\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHaving played 1634 hours of Space-Engineers and hosting my own dedicated servers as well as managing my own communities for this game, I have seen the ups and downs of the progress. Early on, there was great progress, along with many new features that needed refining.\n\nIn very early 2014 I downloaded a cracked version of SE to test it out. 400 hours later I bought the game to help support and add my constructive criticisms to improve the game. Rotors, Pistons, and so much more was added!\n\nThrough many of the requests by players, we got many additions and other grand features, like warp drive, batteries, sensors, and much more.\n\nNETCODE --- Players asked for better multiplayer netcoding, we got BLOCK COLOURS... This adding of "Flash and flare" as I call it, has done nothing but satiate the players who can't see past their own noses. This "flash and flare" has been a constant method of Keen to satiate EVERY request for multiplayer netcoding along with "Soon".\n\nWell.. We are now nearly 2 years down the line, the game is BEYOND playable in terms of multiplayer. Simulation speeds will drop to .3 - .2 with few physics operations.\n\nPLANETS --- No doubt a big deal. They are very impressive! Well, until you realize that you CAN NOT play on them. Search youtube for "Planetary Holes". Since then, we got exploding Cyborg Dogs... Really? More flash and flare to distract the simple-minded players from the ABYSMAL quality of multiplayer.\n\n1 year ago I had a relatively stable world with 2 large 800 meter asteroids that I generated for my dedicated server and the community that played. The forums run by Keen were flooded with players and groups and communities with lavish ideas and doing everything they could to encourage improvements for this game.\n\nSince then, Keen has done nothing but ALIENATE the valuable playerbase they first had. Read the replies for each weekly update, dating as far back as possible. The vast majority of the players have left, along with countless multiplayer communities. The comments have degenerated into useless "Thanks!" replies along with the "Negative Constructive Criticism" from the few valuable players who still cling to the hope that Keen will eventually fix this game.\n\nThe final interaction I will have with Keen and their products after this review is posted, is to wipe it from my personal computer as well as my dedicated server once and for all.\n\nFor a game with such grand potential, Keen has squandered it, and lost their most valuable resource - THE LOYAL PLAYERS WHO STUCK THROUGH THE FIRST YEAR OF MAJOR ISSUES. Now you are held up by fanboys parading "THANKS!" on each weekly update instead of the QUALITY that you first demonstrated.  Shame on you Keen, however, shame on me for actually trusting your company and it's HISTORY of incomplete products.

It's worth buying at a later date, however, when major bugs in MP and SP will be resolved. The constant instability of the game due to new bugs introduced every week is going to turn you off from playing it. That's why this review is negative. Space Engineers needs to have more stable updates, and bugs must be at least not evident the moment we start the game. Early access can exscuse most of them, but some don't need even testing to be seen, and those are not exscusable.\n\nI am confident that in the upcoming months major bugs will eventually be resolved, and thus I recommend SE at a later date or at discounted price.","April 18","false","775.6"," 71 of 111 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","71","111","3","4"

It already has numerous features like a conveyer system and different shaped blocks (like wedges) which minecraft can't do without mods.\n\nAt this time, there are no bad guys to fight/ challeges to complete in solo mode. Like minecraft, the "survival" part of the game ends pretty quickly. In minecraft, you build a farm and a house with a bed. In Space Engineers, you build a little station and get some uranium/solar panels. Survival is trivial. After that, the game becomes about gathering resources and building bigger and better ships.\n\nLike minecraft, multiplayer is where the possibilities really open up. There are tons of active multiplayer servers. This game even has a server browser! Also there's already an active modding community. I expect to see a lot of great mods in the future.\n\nThe game is still early in development but there's plenty of entertainment to be had for the price.

Until recently, Space Engineers was a game I would play heavily for a month or so, and then put down for an indefinite amount of time until I got the itch to build a sci-fi wet dream all over again. About two months ago, I heard that there was some talk about putting planets into the game, and I decided to ease myself back into the mechanics before the launch of the new update, which proved to be counter-intuitive as the update changed everything I knew about the game.\n\nThe Review\n\nAs the mechanics of the game itself have heavily changed since the introduction of planets, this section will cover my thoughts post-update. Planetary gravity has revolutionized everything about the way this game is played from the ground up. When I first loaded up my new world, I found myself amidst the derelict husk of a spaceship in the middle of the night somewhere on the face on an earthlike planet, out of broadcasting range of my friends. We initially spent the first two hours discovering we were out of range of the strongest beacons, and that we couldn’t seem to build a ship strong enough to escape the planets gravity, much less keep them upright during the building process. Eventually we discovered that it all came down to mass, center of gravity, and the angle at which we tried to escape the atmosphere.\n\nThis is what draws me to launching this game every night, the sudden tangibility of the  world  solar system post-update. You can easily lose a ship you spent hours assembling due to a misplaced thruster, crashing into a planet leaving nothing but a crater behind. The map spaces are so large that you can lose your base, your friends, and all sense of direction. The core difference between gameplay as it exist now compared to a year ago, is that you frequently have to build something to address a crisis, and not just because you want to.\n\nDespite all of the positives this game brings to the table, it does struggle with some graphical and physics based glitches. While most of these boil down to minor annoyances in the grand scheme of the game, there have been moments when these issues have rendered my game unplayable.\n\nIt would be a travesty to discuss what makes this game great without touching on the fantastic modding community attached to it. The people who love this game have created everything from small physics fixes to gigantic rail canons capable of punching a whole through practically anything. You would be missing out if you didn't browse through the Steamworkshop for this title.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nThis game provides a form of sci-fi fantasy fulfillment rooted in compelling physics, and a fantastic community. While this is not a game for the easily frustrated, as it suffers from a variety of technical and graphical glitches, I have found that almost any question I have is answered shortly by a quick browse through the forums, and the developer has frequently implemented changes derived from player feedback (i.e. the planets update). If you are willing to invest the time to learn the games physics and nuanced mechanics, the payoff is worth it.\n\nGood fit for: Sci-fi fans, Simulator junkies, Creative types. Bad fit for: Fast-paced gamers, Glitch haters.","November 25, 2015","true","109.8"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","22","26","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NamelessOblivion/recommended/244850/","NamelessOblivion","Nameless Oblivion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NamelessOblivion/","275 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis review is of the Early Access (pre-release) version of the game, current as of 10/13/2014, and pertains almost exclusively to the Survival mode of the game.\n\nEarly access it may be, but Space Engineers is worth a look if you enjoy builders (eg. Minecraft-style) games. I've spent much of the past weekend mining, refining, assembling, and then building the components of various ships and devices, to much enjoyment. Flight is Newtonian, jetpacks are standard, and the freedom of flight on top of the construction mechanics is enjoyable.\n\nHowever, like most builder games, Space Engineers has a large element of resource collection and extraction. In this case, it's also part of the charm - there's nothing like building your first tunnel-boring machine and using it to core right through an enormous asteroid - but expect to spend some time mining if you're not simply playing creative mode. That means some relatively mundane mining - whether it's small scale mining by hand, or large scale resource extraction. It also means finding ores, but the game provides tools for this (ore detectors, lights, and conveyor/connector systems) to permit a player to facilitate this as much as possible mechanically without actually removing it.\n\nWhen creating a survival mode world, give some consideration to your intended style of play. For instance, the game offers the opportunity to let welding (construction), grinding (deconstruction), refining (ores into ingots), assembly (ingots into components), and general inventory size be faster, more efficient, or simply larger. These changes can alter a survival mode game into something much more like the creative mode, or allow a single player to have the ability to move the ores and components of ten men when multiplayer is not available. None of this will stop a single player from playing as they wish, but it will have an impact on the level of tedium a player may have to ignore or overcome to enjoy the game.\n\nFull disclosure: I'm currently playing a "all settings realistic" Lone Survivor start, where I've gotten my first mining barge up and running despite starting with nothing more than a hand drill and the basic machines needed to process ores and materials. There's a sense of satisfaction attached to starting with "nothing" and bootstrapping yourself into an effective spot.\n\nAs it's early access, the only "threat" the game proivides is in the form of wandering mostly-passive cargo vessels (turrets ahoy) to attack, scrap, or plunder (optional and default to off), or metor swarms hammering your landing pads and ships. Metors can be avoided easily by building some basic armor for your stations, or building them in the shadow of the rocks, but on the highest settings you'll be hard pressed to avoid the constant barrage of rock from above.\n\nI'd recommend this - but keep in mind it's a lot like Minecraft. Sandbox and passive play is the order of the day, not frenetic action. (Though, the game certainly seems to support it, with gatling guns and rocket pods along with its assault rifles and jetpacks.) It's a much more spartan and simple affair than its learning curve will initially indicate, but there's plenty of sand from which to build your castle-in-the-sky.","October 13, 2014","true","589.3"," 27 of 35 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","27","35","0","0"

To my delight the development team has been really hard at work with releasing updates which more often than not contain noticeably good tweaks to content and optimization. Updates are seen at a regular interval of about twice a month and if there's one thing I learned from fooling myself into getting Starforge and watching the progress of Starbound it's that steady updates are king and there's nothing more irritating that developers who spend more time talking about how great the game will be when it's finished than they do working on the game. As with any early access game there's still a lot of work to be done; the most recent update was as a fantastic jump on optimization which allows for collisions to be made without losing literally all of your frames for a few seconds but the Survival mode which was also implemented with it is still at a lackluster state where it's only really worth checking out if you want to demo what will soon come around.

This game had tons of potential only to fall short due to bugs that never get fixed or never stay fixed (pistons for one).\n\nThey seem more interested in adding more features vs fixing all the deep issues this game has. It's nearly impossible to have a stable server with a player count over 8 to 10 people if they are all active mining/whatever.\n\nIn my opinion they should get the game as stable as they can then add features after that, but logging in and having bookmarks/ships/whatever up and disappear for no good reason makes it hard to play multiplayer.\n\nTo even think about hosting a half way stable server you have to run third party tools like server extender even then you have to jump through a lot of hoops. I couldn't tell you why keen didn't hired the person who made Server Extender, the server end would be a bit better if they did.\n\nI usually get a itch for the game every so often and will play for a bit until I cant deal with the bugs anymore and quit for a while hoping they fix it at some point only to keep being repeatedly disappointed.\n\nIf you catch it under $10 on sale and want to gambling it will turn into something better go for it. With keens past history I hope they just dont release the xbox version and bail out on us. We shall see.\n\nWith all the negative comments I have posted above I will say when the game works with out crashing or pistions killing you and your entire family its unlike any other game thats out.\n\nMy expectations of a great space engineers game would be to have at least 30 people doing whatever they want with in reason and no lag/slow down on the server.\n\nBut go look for yourself if you have it pull up a server list see how many servers have 15 or more people in them, not many.","April 8","false","705.3"," 48 of 73 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","48","73","0","2"

Because of the amount of complexity, you can also create your own 'game modes', if you put your mind to do it - moreso than unmodded Minecraft. The physics are 'real' - you'll have to worry about gravity, structural integrity, damage, and momentum. Flying your first ship is a thrilling experience; being crushed or slingshotted by a stray piece of dismantled ship or space trash is, as well.

The game offers two modes - Survival and Creative - both allow you to build your own space ships and space stations, one of which actually requiring you to mine, refine, and assemble materials into parts before welding them into your ship.\n\nThe game is a little slow and meaningless if you play it by yourself but if you can find some friends to share a base with, and create factions to fight each other, the game is very entertaining due to the number of possibilities. The limited number of game functions at the moment is offset by the Workshop, which seamlessly (YES, NO ISSUES!) integrates hundreds of new blocks and backgrounds into the game without a hickup, only requiring a slightly longer load time. If you can manage to find people you like (or hate) to play the game with you, you will have a blast. However, single player doesn't offer too many fun possibilities, as building a ship doesn't really accomplish anything without having something to use it for - you will be alone in space in the most literal sense.\n\nWhile it lacks some more advanced mechanics calculations and possibilities for real engineers, it does offer those with a knack for programming and configuring controls the opportunity to customize features and design complex mechanisms to accomplish various tasks ranging from opening a door to operating a complex automated train line. It is a load of fun when you design things you can show off to other players (and attack them with), but be prepared to not be very useful at the beginning - some things aren't too intuitive, and PvP can be brutal.","December 19, 2014","true","100.2"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","0"

They added them!\n\nThe community is awesome as well, however, like any community there is the bad part of it. Try creating a public creative server, it won't work too well, it'll just have spammers. At least until mod api supports more. Aside from the creative servers, you can find a community you love being around, just takes time to find one.\n\nMissing content to the game? Look to the modding community, there is tons and tons of content created for the game.\n\nPros:\n- Infinite worlds, just explore or create a huge empire.\n- PLANETS!!! They are beautiful in every way, they're just gigantic, I mean like... MASSIVE. Oh, and... The best part, The ENTIRE planet can be destroyed, sure that takes up a lot of resources, but its possible. You could make a hole from 1 side to another.\n- Building mechanics are awesome, many decoration mods to make ships feel like they're actually a space ship.\n- Enjoyable if you play with your friends, teamwork can make things a lot faster.\n- The game sort of has a goal now, starting on a planet, and moving up into space, and jump drives being end game. The alien planet is far away, and is dangerous and very exciting to be on, and be eaten alive!\n- Planets do not support DX9, why is this a Pro? Because DX9 is like extremely old and outdated.\n\nCons:\n- The game is getting better at optimization, still laggy, but getting better. Consider the scale of the game, and what it has now.\n- Some patches released can break the game a bit, but generally they're getting better, after all, it still is Alpha.\n- The game pushes limits, so don't expect it to run on your 2005 dell computer, it's not going to. The game requires nice hardware, but at the same time, the game is pushing the limits by adding  content that has never been done before.","December 18, 2014","true","145.4"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","17","19","3","0"

Space Engineers has a lot of promise. First however, it needs a lot of fixing. Server side I am aware of a nominally fixed memory leak caused by voxel updates (we think, hard to be sure). Not ACTUALLY fixed, despite patch notes: our server admin has tested this thoroughly.\n\nClient side... I don't know where to begin. Sometimes my oxygen won't replenish, or my energy, when sitting in a pod with both supplied. Sometimes objects literally destroy themselves while I build them. Just now I lost almost two hours of solid work because things I build don't always default to BELONGING TO ME.\n\nMy advice is pretty simple. Wait until the devs iron out most of these things before giving them money for the project. Currently it is frustratingly prone to glitchy behavior, and while the game is playable you will see tons of things go wrong.\n\nTl;dr, Dark Souls 3 is more rewarding and less frustrating than this. Infer what you will from that.","April 25","false","95.3"," 36 of 53 people (68%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","68","36","53","3","2"

In the start you spawn in a rescue ship and have to fly over to your station, this will take about 3 minutes at max, then once you're at your station, well, you start your engineering aspect of the game, you start with a Welder, a Grinder, and a Hand Drill. You should start building a ship, or a miner, etc, off the start as you need some sort of transportation instead of the rescue ship.\nYou need to be very patient with the crashes you get all the time and how laggy the game can be, also gotta be patient with your progress and how complicated things can be, I recommend watching a tutorial on the game, anyways.\nI would rate this game overall an 7/10 due to its many crashes and lag spikes, once this has a few patches I'm going to edit this review.","August 12, 2014","true","22.5"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","21"

If you like playing alone in an empty universe, then you must definitely try this game. You won't regret it. It is one of the best single-player sandbox games I have ever played.\n\nEverything is great until you try the multiplayer.\nExtremely unstable, insanely laggy, frustratingly buggy.\n\nNo, it's not my internet connection (I have a very fast connection) and no, it's not my pc (I have a very high end pc).\nIt's just that the game is severely unoptimized. Whenever I join an online server, the game switches to s**t mode.\n\nThere are so many things not working in multiplayer that I can't possibly list them here, some of which are:\n\n- Lag gets so extreme that you must wait for 30 seconds for even the most simple action\n- Game freezes for 10 - 20 seconds for no apparent reason\n- Player jumping all over the place, without any chance of controlling it\n- Lag stuttering gets so intense that can give you a seizure\n- On planets, player suddenly starts sinking into the ground, free falling to the center of the planet and ultimately dying\n- Sudden death for completely inexplicable reasons\n- Parked vehicles explode for no reason\n- Stationed ships explode for no reason\n- Drills and rotors explode for no reason\n- Merge blocks explode for no reason\n- Parked vehicles jumping all over the place for no reason\n- Stationed ships jumping all over the place for no reason\n\nYou get the idea.\n\nOverall, great for single-player, unplayable in multiplayer.\nYes, it is in early access but there are serious bugs that remain unsolved for 2 years and I don't think they will be ever solved.\n\nLooks like this game suffers from the eternal-early-access syndrome, which is very common these days.\n","May 1","false","164.5"," 40 of 61 people (66%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","66","40","61","2","0"

Now the game is strikingly beautiful on top of being and intense build it game.\n\nGoing over specifics of this game is hard, theres far too much complexity to the base game to sum up its gameplay into a less than novelistic review, that doesn't consider the vast mod base this game has either, which is equally pumping out awesome new things daily.\n\nIf I had to pick one bad  thing to say about SE, it would have to be the "static" celestial environment, granted planets are only barely coming into the game, but even with unlimited universe, high density, planets, meteor showers, random AI, theres still a missing feeling given everything is in its relative positions static, which for me takes away from a space gaming experience.\n\nAdditionally, the multiplayer could still use a lot of stability work, dedicated servers are still a myth in my book, with regular crashes, and continual "update screwed the server files" from server operrators, I find it hard to play this game multiplayer(less I'm hosting) and annoyingly lonely considering I always seem to be kicking everyone shortly before they crash a giant ship into my space station...LOL\n\nWith that said, I've got to give this game a 9/10. leaving room for the obvious improvement the devs will be making in future updates.\n\nWhen you're done stealing your mothers credit card, hook yourself up with a copy of SE STAT!","January 27","true","840.7"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","0"

You know, a person who looks great and you can have a lot of fun with, but ruins every moment with annoying nagging and sudden emotional explosions. This person knows how stressful this is for you and promises to change this attitude, but simply won't do that. To hide that, this person makes you presents in order to make you forget those flaws. But you don't want those presents... You want this relationship to work!\n\nThat's pretty much this game.\n\nHeck darn, it's fun to play.. or it WOULD be fun to play! Establishing a base, building ships and do things with other players? Sounds awesome! But all thouse freakouts in multiplayer makes it almost unenjoyable. Recently I found a server and played hours on it because the performance was bearable... Yeah, you can call hourly server crashes, violent twitching of objects and other bunches of bugs 'bearable'. Singleplayer or private MP runs almost flawless, but that's not the space adventure you want to have. You want to communicate with other people! Trade with them, explore with them, fight with them!\nTrust me, I'd LOVE to give this a positive review, but I can't. Not with all those problems. The developers made me have hope for this game, but that hope vanishes with every session i play. As long as it stays like this, my thumb stays down.","January 19","false","355.1"," 94 of 158 people (59%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","59","94","158","20","0"
