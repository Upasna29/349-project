And yet, I always made sure to remove the "mow grass" from their job descriptions; keeping it meant your handymen would be off mowing instead of doing everything else. And yet, I always felt bad for the grass; was it really right to neglect it, simply because of a minor inconveniance to my park? So I always hired one more than I needed, and made his only job being to mow grass. 35$ monthly, earned solely through his sweat and his lawnmower. Off in the unexplored regions of the park, where nobody can even see the grass he's mowing. I always made sure to give him a absurd name.\n\nAround 10 years later, I find myself tracking Dorkle's adventure through the wilderness, chronicling his neverending battle against the grass, as I try to find a good spot for the next ferris wheel.\n\n10/10 would relive cherised childhood memories again.","November 28, 2015","true","28.2"," 120 of 120 people (100%) found this review helpful 126 people found this review funny","100","120","120","126","3"

Not just one, but each of the game's 70+ scenario is a different park. The scenarios get broken into four different categories: original, loopy landscapes, corkscrew follies, real life parks and extra parks. There is no fast forward button, so you're stuck going at the same pace. A game year would be an hour of real life time and several scenarios go between 3 - 4 hours. Each scenario has success conditions like have X amount of people in your park by year 3 with a rating of over 600. Others are more complex like double the park value without taking out a loan. Then after the time expires, you can keep playing if you'd like. There is around 210+ hours of game in these scenarios.\n\nAs the manager of the theme park, you can plop down rides. From there, you can paint them, change their music and entrances. Even change different options on each one like how many times does a Ferris wheel go around? You'll build walkways to get to places and lanes to get to ride entrances. Without lanes no one will stand in line. The longer the lanes, the longer people need to wait in line. You can even raise and lower terrain, add water all at a price.\n\nThe joy here is designing your own tracks. Roller coasters, go carts, flumes, slides and every other type of track. The game comes with premade tracks, but you can design your own as you go. Couture them to your land, have them dive into tunnels, over walkways. Heck design them to launch the trains off the track to kill people. This is your game, you do what you want. Just don't expect anyone to ever ride a crashed roller coaster again. You can even take away bridges to drown your patrons.\n\nBuilding the tracks is fun, there are a lot of roller coasters to chose from. Standing steel, sitting steel, inverted steel, wooden, twisting steel, diving coasters that can drop at 90 degree angles, hanging steel and far too many others to list. Different rides have different needs. Some need to be a smoother ride with less sharp turns. Others like the wild mouse roller coaster need sharp turns everywhere. The only down side is you make it as you go. There is no way to construct your perfect coaster, then add it into the game like you can with Roller Coaster Tycoon 2. You can still save any track design to your premade tracks to use at a different time.\n\nEach ride has stats broken into three categories, excitement, intensity and nausea. Every patron has their own stats. If they're looking for something calm, intense or exciting. If your ride is 18 loops back to back with an excitement stat of 23, but an intensity level of 23, don't expect many riders. If rides are too gentle, like kid slides and bumper cars, you'll hear about it. You need to pace things, blend gentle rides next to thrill rides. The more nauseating the ride, the more people will throw up unless you have enough benches outside the ride exit for them to sit down on.\n\nIf someone throws up, you'll need to hire handymen to clean it up. They'll also water gardens, mow grass, empty trash cans and so on. You can even set the land they cover. When your rides break down, you will need mechanics not just to fix them, but inspect them. This ensures rides run with less down time and no one randomly dies due to brakes cutting out and one trains smashes into another. There are security guards for when patrons get too angry. Costumed characters can get hired to keep people happy while they're waiting in line.\n\nDecorations also boost patron enjoyment. Plant flowers near walkways, statues near lines, plants and trees next to rides. Its all up to you. Decorations next to a ride will slightly increase its excitement value. For the most part, designing a ride track under, over and next to either itself or a different ride will boost its excitement level. With enough effort, you can make a merry go round into an exciting ride, but its easier to make anything else in the park exciting.\n\nThere is a thought view of everyone in the park, so you can determine what the people want. Are they hungry? Thirsty? Sick? Do they need to 'go?' Well then build food stalls, drink stalls, benches and bathrooms. There are a lot of different stalls and you can set the price on everything in the park including setting all your drink stalls to charge the same price. Not just that, but there are plenty of merchandise stalls full of things for your patrons to buy when they're happy enough.\n\nSo how do you get different stalls, rides, coasters and decorations? You devote X amount of dollars each month to ride development. Minimum, medium, maximum or no funding at all. This will be how quickly you'll unlock something for the park you're managing. There are even check boxes for what you want to research. Gentle rides, thrill rides, roller coasters, shops & stalls, scenery and ride improvements. Ride improvements are simple things like putting a wooden roller coaster train backward.\n\nThe game is very flexible when it comes to finances. Each scenario will usually start you off with a hefty bank loan that has minimal interest. You can get a bank loan up to a certain amount, depending on the scenario. Having money always lets you keep playing and growing. If you outgrow your park, then just buy land tile by tile. Its a little tedious, but whatever. Sometimes you need to buy rights to have your coasters go over roads, because you can't buy the land itself. While you can charge money for each ride, you can also make them all free with a park entry fee. Some scenarios force you to do certain things financially. The restrictions, coupled with the different parks make it interesting. Instead of just having the perfect park over and over again.\n\nOn top of that, there is promotion for your park. Pay X amount for park or ride marketing for X number of weeks. Free ride vouchers, free food, half price entry for the park and so on. Its all to draw people in when you need it. Without patrons you can't make money, but all you really need are fresh rides. Old rides start breaking down more often. People visit them less in favor of newer rides. No one wants to spend $4 to ride your 3 year old roller coaster and so on.\n\nThe patrons themselves seem pretty dumb. They'll walk in circles, so I've found straight lines are the best way to get them around the park. In one of the expansions of the deluxe version, there is a no entrance sign that you can post. People can't enter, but they can come out. Its helpful, especially for scenarios that start you in a park that has dozens of paths. Patrons get lost and start destroying things.\n\nI've owned Roller Coaster Tycoon for 15+ years. Its one of the first PC games that I bought with my own money after playing the 3 scenario demo. Not just that, but then I proceeded to buy all the expansion packs. I've completed the game on 5 different computers. I am big into management and tycoon games and I think this is one of the best if not the best.\n\nEven though a lot of people enjoy Roller Coaster Tycoon 2 more for its much larger parks, I still like the original better. I still feel its the best management game, but I can understand that the game can play itself at some point. You can walk away for two hours and come back with the scenario completed. Unless of course a roller coaster explodes or something. Its a relaxing low stress game, even if you're put in charge of a place that people could die... and you can kill them.","January 10, 2015","true","39.8"," 105 of 107 people (98%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","98","105","107","4","0"

Let's answer some questions.\n\n"What is this game?"\n\nRollercoaster Tycoon is a franchise where the player becomes an amusement park owner with the power to create tracks, customize everything from the terrain and decor to the ride names and colors, and even charging people to use the BATHROOM. Great idea. Think the sims, but without families and more workers and rides.\n\n"Any ACTUAL skills I can get from this game?"\n\nYes. Balancing out a budget is seen by the money amount you are given in loans. These allow you to buy rides, stands, construct in general, advertise, et cetera. These loans CAN be paid off so you can run the park and not have your money taken away every month for loans. Also, there is keeping things cleaned/organized. The park gets awards based on how you run it, ranging from "Safest Park in The Country" to "Worst Looking Park". In order to keep good PR, you want to hire some handymen who sweep up all the vomit and trash people leave lying around.\n\n"Anything popular come out of this game?"\n\nI WANT TO GET OFF MR.BONES' WILD RIDE\nI WANT TO GET OFF MR.BONES' WILD RIDE\nI WANT TO GET OFF MR.BONES' WILD RIDE\nI WANT TO GET OFF MR.BONES' WILD RIDE\n\n"Why not just RCT3?"\n\nRCT3 is just, eh. It's hard to explain. RCT3 is not a bad game at all, trust me, I own that one as well and its fantastic. But, it will never have the same bouncy feel the early ones do. RCT3 is more calming and orderly. RCT 1 and 2 are bouncy, chaotic, and generally more enjoyable. In the earlier games, you get more of a RCT feel and less of a Sims. The gui in RCT3 even looks like the Sims. Still tho, try both and see which is your cup of tea.\n\n"DLC?"\n\nget out\n\n"Any bugs?"\n\nThe game is being updated constantly due to being on steam, mainly in language support from what I've seen, but that doesn't mean its lost some if its old bugs. Sometimes, mechanics pay no attention to rides and they just get fixed on their own by some means. Guests still just wander off park when you delete the path they're on instead of finding another path. RCT was made in 1999, so its not really a suprise when these things happen. You just have to push them in the right direction and it's all figured out (by that I mean pick them up and throw them at the ride's enterance until they get it RIGHT).\n\n"Is the music good?"\n\nHoly ♥♥♥♥, yes.\n\nYou can set music differently for each ride, so if you don't appreciate one song, just pick another!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBasically, get this game. You will not regret it.","October 16, 2014","true","12.9"," 96 of 100 people (96%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","96","96","100","11","0"

I originally got this game back in 1999 when it was first released, and 16 years later it's still fun to play. The Steam version also comes with both expansion packs.\n\nThe game had amazing optimization for its time. It ran smooth on a 400 MHz Celeron, even with a huge park. Chris Sawyer is a programming genius for making the game run so well. It still works on modern systems too, and runs flawless on Windows 8.1.\n\nThere is a large variety of different rides to build, and you can build your own roller coaster designs. There are also lots of different scenarios to play and unlock, each with their own goals.\n\nThe only downsides to this game are the lack of mod support, and that there is no sandbox mode. There are, however, a few scenarios with unlimited money, though they still have goals you have to reach, and failing them will result in your park being permanently closed.\n\nStill, it's an amazing game, even to this day. I would recommend if you enjoy building simulators and/or theme park management games, or just for the nostalgia if you played it years ago.","June 7, 2015","true","0.4"," 83 of 85 people (98%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","98","83","85","0","1"

The Pre-Rendered graphics still hold up to this day better than most games of it's time. The most impressive thing about this game is the development of it. It was programmed by one man; Chris Sawyer. The highlight of this game is seeing your guests come off your ride enjoying themselves. It is a very rewarding experience. That's not to say this game is without faults. One of the bigger problems is the limitation of scenery. This was however fixed in the game's sequels, and if we go into nitpicking, there are problems with the janitors only mowing grass (which can be easily fixed by checking a box). These things can be overlooked however and I believe that this entry in the series is by far the most rewarding. I haven't sunk as many hours into this game as the other entries but that doesn't mean I haven't had fun the entire time, grinning like an idiot ear to ear\n\n8/10","August 1, 2015","true","38.7"," 51 of 52 people (98%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","98","51","52","3","0"

Which therein made me buy a virtual copy so he couldn't touch it.\n\nI have spent countless upon countless hours on this game. My oldest brother who rarely played video games played this. My sister who never plays video games played this. Even my dad spent half an hour trying to figure the game out before saying he had something better to do. RollerCoaster Tycoon may have been the first park simulator game (arguably).\n\nRollerCoaster Tycoon is a park simulator game (an old one I should add). You are a manager of a park and call all the shots. When you first start on a map, there may be trees in your way or uneven land preventing you from building properly. Not a problem. Trees can be removed and dirt can be manipulated at your whim (for a nice price of course :)! Alternatively, you may build underground. Basic rides such as a merry go round, track-carts and a pirate ship may be available. You may further your parks research and choose specifically what you want to be researched.\n\nI personally go after the thrill rides first and try to acquire go-karts as they are a money maker! My first piece of advice would be to go to the research tab and ensure that you are maximizing (the research) and choose what you would like to be discovered. If you don't like my idea, heck makes some new roller coaster, scenery or even a new food kiosk! The rides get pretty crazy after some research and some new insane roller coasters (like suspended ones) come out. Be mindful of your designs. Some guests don't like rides that cost too much, are too long, are too short, are too intense or not intense enough. I haven't quite figured out the scheme to build a successful roller coaster but I found simple concepts that use gravity instead of using manual rails to get your roller coaster to a height is preferred. Some types of roller coasters (or rides like the log flume for instance) give only a certain amount of flexibility regarding their construction. Some coasters allow for tight turns while some need extra wide turns. Some (like the steel roller coasters) can do helix's and loops! Information kiosks are also available to sell your customers umbrellas and maps of your park.\n\nAdditional scenery items can also be placed by the player (and unlocked as mentioned) such as trees, gardens, statues, fountains, benches and even garbage cans. Benches by exits of thrilling rides are exceptionally needed as some guests may have to puke. While sitting down, they slowly recover and you don't have to pay as much for an extra handy man. There are service staff that can be hired, most notably mechanics and handymen. Handymen will keep your park clean and will water the gardens whereas mechanics do inspections on rides and fix them as needed. Guests and rides in the park can be clicked on to get feedback (as in was it fun, what is this person thinking, what is this person thinking about this particular ride etc...). Almost anything can also be renamed (including guests) and admission costs to get into the park can be modified. Parks come in different sizes, shapes, colors and location. RCT works off a grid system making it quite easy to build what you need to build.\n\nThe graphics are not quite outdated but will be bothersome to a few. A full screen resolution is available and should work on most to all monitors. I think the game play will outweigh the graphics on this one. Sounds are pretty varied except for the screams coming from the people on the rides and the noise of the rides themselves.\n\nThe game was pretty big back in the day, still sort of is. It may take a bit of time to build up and get your park to a steady standard. To some, that wait is definitely worth it.\n\n(Game rating back in the day 8.2/10)\n\n\nRATING : 7.1/10\n\n\n\nGameplay	B	Story / Campaign	B	Visuals / User Interface	B-	Sounds / Music	C+	Replay-ability	B	Overall 	B","December 8, 2015","true","5.9"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","18","18","3","0"

A classic that I grew up with, and was amongst the very first games I've played in my life, so it was an instant buy for me, alongside RCT2.\n\nHere, like the games after it, you manage a theme park, and try to keep the rating as high as possible, and basically keep your visitors happy. (And if you so wish drown those who don't like your park, just to set an example)\n\nIt's a fairly simple, and straight forward game that you can sink many, many hours into trying to manage your park, create the ultimate rollercoasters, and keep profit up at the same time.\n\nThis game, unlike it's successor Rollercoaster Tycoon 2, has unlockable scenario's. You start with several scenario's, and work your way up (or down) from that, trying to get to the very bottom of the list. There's three lists of unlockable scenario's. One for the vanilla game, and the other two are from the expansions Corkscrew Follies and Loopy Landscapes, so if you're a completionist; you'll be sinking many, many hours into it!\n\nOther than that, the game has aged very well since when it was released back in 1999. So do you like managing parks, creating rollercoasters, completing scenario's to progress and having countless of hours of fun? Then throw your money at the screen and buy this game already!\n\nI give this game a definite 9/10, truly a wonderous game!","May 15, 2015","true","0.6"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","16","16","0","0"

The focus of this game would be the missions, which usually requires you to have at least a certain number of guests, and at least a certain park approval rating.\n\nOn the first couple missions, there's hardly anything pre-built, or in your way, so you can just keep playing those on a loop, or continue them after you win to build the park of your dreams. Some of the later missions have a lake or something in your way, or maybe a park with rides in it already.

RollerCoaster Tycoon is arguably the best tycoon game of all time. The game's development was mostly credited to only one man (Chris Sawyer), and was released in 1999. There were four games that defined my childhood. The Sims, Age of Empires II, Dungeon Keeper 2, and this.\n\nRollerCoaster Tycoon truly gives you the power to make exactly the kind of amusement park you want to build. Even in the scenarios, it largely feels like a free building game; the game does not ask you to do anything you don't want to do. For example, instead of asking you to build a park based on nothing but rollercoasters like some games might have implemented, Rollercoaster Tycoon simply plops you down on a plot of land and basically says, "Get this many guests and have a good park rating in three years. Have fun and buh-bye!" This game should be truly applauded for being a tycoon game that is not only great fun, but never turns into a chore by forcing you into situations where you feel you're only doing something to beat a level. It gives you an end goal, and it's up to you, the player, to decide exactly how you'll get there.\n\nThe game allows you to build your own rollercoaster, water slide, log flume, monorail, railroad (and many more) designs from scratch, which gives you endless possibilities in each level (and you will be playing levels over and over again simply for the fun of doing them multiple ways). You can build these rides around one another, underground, over water...there are few limitations. You can also decide what color themes each ride has (or not), even down to making each car in a rollercoaster train a different color. Also, put shops and food stalls around your park and decide how much to charge. You can even charge for guests to use the bathroom, bringing out the greedy capitalist in each of us (I usually make a profit over running costs with my bathrooms, charging just $0.10 per visit).\n\nYou can even name guests and track them, which brings another level of fun to an already ridiculously great game. Read a guest's thoughts, pick him up and drop him in front of a ride you think he'll like, see what things he's bought from your park that are in his inventory. Hey, you can even drop him in a lake if he's so angry he's potentially messing with your park rating and drown him. It's up to you!\n\nRollerCoaster Tycoon is also, in my opinion, better than its sequels. Other than some rides not being available in some levels, it will never revoke your abilities. In RollerCoaster Tycoon 2, there were levels where you had to meet a scenario goal without charging any entry fee for your park, for example, which only ended up taking freedom from the player's hands while pushing itself into the "chore tycoon" category. RollerCoaster Tycoon never crosses that line.\n\nIn summary, RollerCoaster Tycoon is a fantastic classic game that is perfect as it is. While the graphics may be simplistic by today's standards, it would be simply ignorant to pass up the game because of it. This game is fun, relaxing, rewarding, timeless, and close to flawless. If you don't yet own this game, pick it up. Otherwise, the only one who is missing out is you. ;)","July 1, 2014","true","81.1"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","0"

Beside the building system(with the scenery it is the one of few things that better on RC2) original is simply the better than its sequel. We all love the design rollercoasters i know that, but we also love the missions and achievement. At RC2 the missions ar meaningless, unfinishable and less fun. So if you can't buy the two of them (i ignore the bad one-RC3) you must choose this one. With the expansion packs, it's a real gem. Believe me i've played those two games for years.

I had this game waaaay back when it first came out, on my Windows DOS machine. This was the game of my childhood, and I couldn't tell you how happy I was when I discovered that it had been released to work on newer generation computers.\n\nAnyway, this game is great if you like to build, and then run the show. It's a pixel game, so it's similar to the likes of theme hospital, or any of these "tycoon" themed games. The aim is to create a thriving theme park, and keep your guests happy. Pretty much everything is customisable, and you can also create your own roller-coasters, which I had hours and hours and hours of fun with as a kid. I was also really impressed with the "Real Life Parks" option when creating a new game. I chose Alton Towers, and was surprised to see a very impressive recreation of the famous UK park - someone, somewhere, has a lot of spare time!\n\nThis game is great for people who like to create and innovate. It's a fun, bright, colourful & an interesting game, and rest assured you'll be following my footsteps and playing this for hours and hours after you've bought it.

Build rollercoasters of such high intensity and make rides in a weired way so more people go on them, however you play the game does not matter, if you like the way you play it is what matters. Hire staff members to keep your facility clean, and if you like murder whenever someone pukes... DROWN THEM!!! So much to do, so much to see, make monster rollercoaster, charge way to much for a merry-go-round, make the umbrellas expensive so everybody has to spend their well earned money on them which makes you rich $$$. Or play the normal way, make a well balanced rollercoaster, sell everything at original value for high ratings, build all types of rollercoasters for different intensity levels... but the game itself is never holding back, so just come on in!","August 26, 2015","true","7.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

At its time it was facinating watching each customer walk through your parks gates and onto the first ride you built. Designing that first coaster and having it explode randomly a week later.  When little Jimmy (Guest 3785) gets lost because you forgot to finsih the pathway. Ahhh yes reminds me of drinking that 48 pack of Arizona Iced Tea from Sams Club I asked for Christmas one year which ruined my teeth.. the good old days we called it.\n\n\n\nThis was one of my first PC games when I was a young man. I would get home from school and boot it up, hearing those same rollercoaster tracks on the title screen over and over.

Alright, lets get this review on the roll.\n\nEver wondered what it would be like to run your very own amusement park, to build rides at the click of a button, and such, then RollerCoaster Tycoon is definetly for you! RollerCoaster Tycoon is one of the best PC games of all time, and it deserves it's place in history as it. The story as to how RollerCoaster Tycoon began was when Scottish video game developer Chris Sawyer, who developed the legendary Transport Tycoon, was planning on making a sequel to the previously mentioned game, but when in the process of making it, Sawyer developed a keen interest in rollercoasters, and with that being done, he shifted his focus from that to making RollerCoaster Tycoon, and thus, a masterpiece was born.\n\nThe basic gameplay of RollerCoaster Tycoon is simple. You're tasked with a specific park of your choosing, and your job there is to reach the goal that is given to you at hand without completely destroying the reputation of the park itself. This can either mean to achieve a certain park rating, amount of guests, and other such tasks that can keep you busy for a while, and with that being said and done, it's time to start building!\n\nYou mainly play from a thirdperson view of the park itself, and you can build whatever you want in it, as long as you have sufficient funds. The game has a variety of different attractions to build, ranging from the gently ferris wheel, to the pulse-pounding steel roller coaster. Doing all this is very fun and addicting and can keep you occupied for a very long time. Since this is also deluxe, you'll have some extra fun with additional scenarios to play in, so you can be sure to have endless hours of gameplay. As the "Tycoon" that you are, building all these rollercoasters, rides, stalls, scenery, and paying all your staff in the park is costly, you'll need to be more careful with what you spend your money on, or else you'll need to start taking loans out, and that's never a good thing. With all being said and done, RollerCoaster Tycoon is one of the best games of this generation, and a must have for everyone of all ages.\n\nIn conclusion, RollerCoaster Tycoon is definitely a must own, and is a materpiece that could never be remade.","May 30, 2014","true","10.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

There are so many ways to be creative from the color schemes of the rides to the beautifying placements of various designed theme park decorations/paths/shrubs/etc. You can name your guests and--I love this--punish them for being jerks.\n\nAll in all, I think this game is pretty awesome.","October 13, 2014","true","3.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Easy to learn, but with a lot of room for improvement especially with the development of bigger and better rollercoasters (learning what works with what type of coasters). All-around a very fun game with one shortfall: a lack of different challenges for the various parks. Most of the time it's just have this many people in your park by the end of year (insert year) and a park rating of (insert park rating). However, don't let this deter you from purchasing this game. With the deluxe edition, there is at least 300+ hours of fun to be had at a low, low price. My score: 9/10.

The scenarios may be very easy for awhile, but overall it is very fun and enjoyable, and a good learning experience for those who like to build their own rides within the game! Anyway, let's get to the breakdown for it.\n\nGameplay: 7.5/10\n\nThis game holds a simple but fun hold of its gameplay. To keep it short and simple, it takes the standard overview "god" role to building things, and allows you to monitor everything and do as you will. While it is a relatively common style, it fits well.\n\nSound: 8/10\n\nThe roller-coasters available in this game for the most part have very good sounds built around them, as is the music of the rides you can choose. However, the smaller rides (minus the Haunted house and rides without a cart and/or moving vehicle) like the Ferris wheel and the Merry-Go-Round have no sound around them if the music is turned off. Whether it was intentional or not, it's not really that big of the deal, the sound still is very good.\n\nGraphics: 9/10\n\nFor its time, the graphics were built very high-end, especially the rides. The detail put around the scenery and the texture of the land is pretty amazing for its original release, but the people seem to have been left out of this small loop, like they have gotten just a tad bit lazy. It's not really that bad though, and is truly a great sight for its age!\n\nControls: 6/10\n\nThe controls consist of a simple click-and-go kinda game. For the most part that is it, but you can hot-key many things, like closing windows, screenshots, opening the tabs available and even for seeing through the ground. The hot-keying is almost a necessity for those looking to do things very quickly, as the clicking can be very burdensome when doing many things you are trying to do. The hot-keys save it, though.\n\nOverall: 7.6/10 (Pretty Good)\n\nThis game certainly holds its head up high for those who look into tycoon games from many angles. A few things here and there can get a little bothering, but overall it's a solid slate, and I would recommend it for anyone willing to try it out!","August 8, 2014","true","54.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

You run a theme park and can make a ton of rollercoasters, stand/shops, trains, farris wheels and other stuff, you can every create you own roller coaster from scratch just make sure you park go'ers enjoy it as in it doesnt make them too nausious or have the que line too long that they get tired of waiting. Very fun, especially for when it came out,. Graphics were good for the time it was released but now have a limited screen resolution rate. Don't be suprised when only half your screen is filled when you play this if your playing in 1920x1080, and this is when it is "fullscreen" which is the only option, there is no windowed view but really how many people actually use that.

My significant other purchased this for me and I was pleasantly surprised with upgrades, new maps, and buildings the original did not offer for a vanilla purchase. I love this game just as much as I did when I was younger. If you are looking for a pleasant, sandbox tycoon game, with a little spice of being able to create some amazing rollercoasters, this is definitely one to try.\n\nAs for gameplay, It changes up what you have to work with with every map when it comes to terrain. Each with their own difficulty, and you don't have to play every map to unlock new ones. They offer at least five in the beginning for variety at the start. unfortunately, the rides don't vary much from map to map. It may get repetitive for some. What rides you get at the BEGINNING vary from map to map, but you will get your simple rides always first. Building a rollercoaster that people cannot get enough of is a great feeling. It is a rather rewarding game and, if you don't want to complete the objectives, you can cause a little mischief by seeing just how far you can make rollercoasters launch off their tracks and into the air.\n\nThe only bad note I have is that it runs rather weird with my computer, since it is such an old game. Some text boxes don't show up, but you can still type in them, so it is not a huge problem. Maybe it will be fixed in the future.\n\nFinal note: This game is a wonderful romp as any tycoon game should be.\n\n","November 16, 2015","true","10.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is very addictive and will win your heart and while you're at it, go buy the 2nd game which is just as awesoem as this. Despite soem hicups running the game, I managed to have it work on Windows 10 without any problems whatsoever.\nPlay it for an hour which then will turn ino 2, then 3, then you realize its morning and you're late for work and now lost your job. Use that sad yet now flexible time to play this game! Seriously, stop readign and buy this game. Its sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good.\n\n\n\nSolution to Windows 10: (NOTE: SORRY IF YOU ALREADY KNOW THIS, ITS FOR PEOPLE WHO AREN'T FARMILIAR WITH SETTING GAMES IN COMPATIBILITY MODE!)\n\nAs you know, Windows 10 hates old games to the point where you can't even run old CD-rom games such as the Sims 1, this game is no exception. The only option is a No CD crack or a digital version.\n\n1. For this game, simply go into your Steam folder (C:ProgramFiles(x86),Steam, Steamapps, Common, RollerCoaster Tycoon Deluxe) and locate the game's .exe file. (or jsut called RCT if you have extentions hidden.)\n2.Right click the icon and go to propperties\n3. Go to the compatibility tab\n4. Run compatibility mode for Windows XP Service pack 2\n5. Check the "run as administrator" box\n6. Check the "Disable display scaling on high DPI settings" box\n7. Click okay, test the game out (for me it worked the 2nd time)\n8.

You add rides, rollercoasters, eateries, facilities, etc.  You must recruit handymen (absolutely vital as the park guests hate the site of sick on the ground!), engineers (your rides will breakdown regularly) & security guards (vandals exist you know).\n\nThe best aspect though, is the designing of your rides.  Some are set, such as the Merry Go Round, but others, such as all the rollercoasters, the log flume etc, you can either accept pre set designs or have a go yourself.  Piece by piece.  There is no better reward than the self design of a monster rollercoaster that the crowds love.\n\nI use Windows 8.2 and this game runs smoothly.\n\nBuy this game.","April 17, 2015","true","90.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/XB92AI/recommended/285310/","XB92AI","upNorth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/XB92AI/","563 products in account","The original Rollercoaster Tycoon is not only one of the most favourite games from my childhood, but it is one of my favourite and most loved games of all time.\n\nRollercoaster Tycoon still holds up until this day.  The mechanics may seem a little clunky compared to back in 1999, but that should not pushh you away from buying this game.\n\nIn Rollercoaster Tycoon you need to build a theme park to complete a set of objectives set out for you at the beginning of each scenario. Some of these objectives can be completed easily while others will take quite a bit of time.  There is many different theme parks and scenarios to chose from, as this version of Rollercoaster Tycoon also includes the expansions!  Pretty good for £4.79.\n\nThere are many different attractions to unlock from Merry Go Round's to Viking Ship to huge Rollercoasters; which is done through researching.  The researching mechanic is really straightforward,  the player needs to select from a bunch of preset options from "minimum" to "maximum"  each option has a different cost attached to it.\n\nThe game is not called Rollercoaster Tycoon for no reason!  The game enables the player to design and create their own custom rollercoaster from scratch!  Make every turn and drop of the track completely unique.  Watch that excitement rating! Players can also create rides such as log flumes, kart racing and even transport attractions such as a monorail.\n\nOf course, you need staff to run a theme park.  The player can recruit four different types of staff:  Handyman, Mechanic, Security and Entertainer.  The handyman is used to keep the staff tidy, water plants and mow the lawn,  the mechanic of course repairs any broken down rides while the security keeps those annoyances away meanwhile the entertainer is busy...well, entertaining people in many different cute and quirky costumes.\n\nThe game offers quite a few customization options.  The player can set how fast a ride can go - Watch out, don't let it crash and kill your guests! Decorations such as statues, water features, plants and trees are available.  Fences, benches and trash cans are needed to keep guests happy!\n\nIf you have fond memories of this game and are reading reviews to make sure it isn't just nostalgia making you interested in the purchase - I found say go for it.  This game is still solid and truly holds up.  Meanwhile, if you have not played this game and are looking for something fun and relaxing, yet potentially challenging; I would say that you owe it to yourself to play this classic game.\n\nPlease note:  The steam overlay does not work in this game.  Meaning you can not press shift + tab to look at friends, guides, achievements, etc, because of this Rollercoaster Tycoon does not support screenshots.  The resolution is off too - This game can not be played on full screen on my monitor.\n\nNow, go charge your guests a $100 entrance fee and overcharge on all food, drinks and rides!","May 21, 2014","true","18.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I find the audio pretty good, the graphics not as bad as they could be, and the GUI incredibly helpful if a little annoying at times.\n\nSteam integration has not been fully added at this time, but devs have promised an HD remaster in the future. So while we can enjoy this masterpiece as it was all those years ago (it's as old as me! and to think I played this so much when I was younger.), we can expect small improvements over time that should be not at all detrimental to the glorious gameplay.","July 5, 2014","true","7.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

REALLY RUN.\n\nRollerCoaster Tycoon is about a game where you make rollercoasters or more specifically amusement parks who have rollercoasters in them. Your goal is to reach a certain amount of guests or park rating, among other things.\n\nThe gameplay is simple. Make attractions, like rollercoasters, Go Karts, Log Flumes, etc., so your park can become more popular. You can charge people for many things, including to use the bathroom, which can be hilarious when they really need to go, but don't want to. However, doing things like that can make completing your objective harder, because people will complain about it, which will bring your park rating down. However, you can drown the unhappy people, which will bring your park rating up for some reason.\n\nHowever, there are some downsides. For example, on my laptop, almost EVERYTIME you close the game, my computer doesn't recognize any touches and FORCES you to shut down by using the power button. Also, the guests are WAY too scared. I made a rollercoaster that just goes down by not that much and it had an intensity meter of 11 and nobody would ride it, even though I made it free and advertised it. Also, NEVER save on the same save file. I did that and it stopped working, which was a world I spent 6 hours on.\n\nFinal Verdict: 8/10\n+Fun\n+Replay Value\n+Years of entertainment\n+Addicting\n-Guests way too scared\n","April 28, 2015","true","18.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game itself is brilliant, but sadly there are too many bugs in this port for new PC's. Its hit or miss whether the game will allow you to save, sometimes it will work fine and sometimes when you press the save button it will just crash to desktop. Sometimes when you launch the game it will crash on startup and sometimes it wont. As others have said, the game doesn't run in full screen mode (however, we're all using HD monitors these days and this was made in 1999, so not really the games fault that we still play it over 15 years later!) - If you're still running XP or have a retro gaming rig that supports steam then this game is well worth it. Sadly if you're running newer OS'es you will face problems (it seems to be the newer the OS the more problems it has, it used to work OKish for me on Win 7 but is pretty much unplayable on Win 10)","March 17","false","9.8"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

The only issues, in fact, are that you won't be able to use the Steam Shift-Tab thing and you will see a little color corruption on the Load/Save/New Game file browser, and it's not even a big deal (plus it's easy to fix, if you go into options).\n\nOne of the earliest sandbox games to date, this lets you build your own theme park.  It features its own economy system, many scenarios vastly superior to those on RCT2, and the three add-ons that added an incredible amount of content to this game, such as the ability to use corkscrews and such in your coasters, and collectively, the game gives you 4 times as many scenarios as the original RCT did.\n\nBuy it while it's on sale, or just buy it for the easy $6.  It's a good trade.  This game beats all of the later titles in the series by far, even if it only supports 4:3 resolutions and will look slightly strechy if not in an easily scalable yet still aspect-locked window.\n\nIf you choose to use the in-game screenshot tool, it will save as a PCX which can be opened using the freeware picture editing tool GIMP.[www.gimp.org]\n\nIt also has some great mechanics, including a tunneling/raised-platform sidewalk system, a way to raise/lower water and ground to make some interesting landscapes, a complete map editor, a custom scenario creator, and even a full roller-coaster editor that's well-built (get it?) so that you don't have to rely on the stock coasters (and also an easy way to save your coasters to add them to the stock coasters, scenery included or not).\n\nCheck out a YouTube video or something first if you don't feel the need to go buy a classic, but for any nostalgia nerd or sandbox player, you should just buy it already.","June 24, 2014","true","15.1"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

The issue is that the support for this game here on Steam is virtually non-existent.\n\nSome cons:\n- Most people cannot get fullscreen to work\n- Despite being in Window mode, you're unable to click outside the window and use the desktop most times\n- The Steam Overlay does not work\n- You can not take screenshots and upload them to the Steam Workshop\n- A small patch was recently released which broke everyones' progress in-game. No explanation or help was offered from any of the developers/CMs, and a crude "fix" for this had to be provided by one of the players\n\nKeep in mind however that I'm not hating on the game itself. In fact, I love it. But if you're new to the series, or even if you're a returning player looking to get back into one of the best games of the 90's, I'd recommend getting this game someplace else or at least waiting until this game is properly supported.","June 2, 2014","false","21.9"," 67 of 150 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","67","150","0","10"

It will simply not respond when I try clicking anything in the options or save menus.\n\nUnfortunately, as much as I love Roller Coaster Tycoon (I have been playing it since it first came out ~15 years ago, and do indeed still have my disc copy), I see absolutely no point in playing the game if I can not progress in it whatsoever, and it is unbelievably frustrating spending hours to create a park worth tens of thousands of dollars -- and then not be able to save.\n\n:( </3","February 6","false","12.0"," 2 of 12 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","2","12","0","5"

It is an odd-toed ungulate mammal belonging to the taxonomic family Equidae. The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature into the large, single-toed animal of today. Humans began to domesticate horses around 4000 BC, and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC. Horses in the subspecies caballus are domesticated, although some domesticated populations live in the wild as feral horses. These feral populations are not true wild horses, as this term is used to describe horses that have never been domesticated, such as the endangered Przewalski's horse, a separate subspecies, and the only remaining true wild horse. There is an extensive, specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts, covering everything from anatomy to life stages, size, colors, markings, breeds, locomotion, and behavior.\n\nHorses' anatomy enables them to make use of speed to escape predators and they have a well-developed sense of balance and a strong fight-or-flight response. Related to this need to flee from predators in the wild is an unusual trait: horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down. Female horses, called mares, carry their young for approximately 11 months, and a young horse, called a foal, can stand and run shortly following birth. Most domesticated horses begin training under saddle or in harness between the ages of two and four. They reach full adult development by age five, and have an average lifespan of between 25 and 30 years.\n\nHorse breeds are loosely divided into three categories based on general temperament: spirited "hot bloods" with speed and endurance; "cold bloods", such as draft horses and some ponies, suitable for slow, heavy work; and "warmbloods", developed from crosses between hot bloods and cold bloods, often focusing on creating breeds for specific riding purposes, particularly in Europe. There are more than 300 breeds of horse in the world today, developed for many different uses.\n\nHorses and humans interact in a wide variety of sport competitions and non-competitive recreational pursuits, as well as in working activities such as police work, agriculture, entertainment, and therapy. Horses were historically used in warfare, from which a wide variety of riding and driving techniques developed, using many different styles of equipment","November 10, 2014","false","0.3"," 9 of 131 people (7%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","7","9","131","6","2"

You can build your own roller coasters, change the names of rides (and even PEOPLE bahaha), and try to meet goals wth deadlines. Plus, this is the deluxe version so there's even more rides and themes to play with.\n\nAlso, there's certain names you can give people to make them do stuff.

It's a really old game, but with the cost that it's currently at, it's well worth the price of admission. The main goal is to unlock all the maps by completing the set objectives by each individual map - obviously as time goes on, the maps get larger and larger and the potential for your park also grows.\n\nApart from that - it's up to you! There are freeform maps where there aren't any set objectives and you can literally go wild without needing to stop. I honestly started playing this game on the original original Xbox and sadly that particular game couldn't be transferred onto the 360, but, as usual, Steam came to my rescue and the experience is miles better and the game is just as engaging as it was when it originally came out. If you get the chance to give it a go, I certainly reccomend this based on the price and the sheer addiction that forces 23 hours out of your day to day life.\n\nAll good and nice, right? Well I have come across a pretty severe bug because for some reason after completing Trinity Islands last night, all my progress has been erased. Not my parks, but my progress; according to the game, I haven't completed one park, and yet according to my computer, I haven't lost a thing. I have no idea what the hell is going on, but I'm going to see if this is a permenant thing or if my computer is just being a ♥♥♥♥ because it's morning.\n\nIn either case - buy this game for the really low price or even if it goes on offer [which is doubtful but Steam offers more packages than a postal delivery service, so it could happen].","May 29, 2014","true","38.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you're looking for a fun and challenging campaign-based RCT, buy this one. If you want lots of mods and custom scenarios to toy with, buy 2. And last, if you want MORE mods, more realistic theme park recreations, water parks, zoo parks, and lots of sandbox coaster building, buy 3. I think all are good, but each has its strong points.\n\nBut anyways, this is the original RCT, with all the expansions and a bunch of fan-made tracks added on. To put it short, it's a good game. The only major problems with this version are its quirks when used with Windows 7 and 8. The game, from what I know, will only run in a square resolution unless you change the inner workings of the EXE. It can crash fairly often, for semi-random reasons. And my install sometimes glitches my desktop when I quit, forcing me to reboot.\n\nHowever, if you can look past some irritating glitches on newer OSes, then this is a must-have. For about the same price as a CD of the game, you get everything on it already on your hard drive, no CD insertion required. If you're a big RCT fan, then I'd say buy it.","July 17, 2014","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When I was younger I would spend hours just building a park, getting a lot of money, and doing much more. (Yes, I also drowned some people in the lakes, just like everyone else does.) If you are looking for a game to waste some time in during your free time, then pick this up. Even if you're not, still pick it up. There are a few bugs in the game though, these include a crash that can happen when saving. Another one is a crash that happens when you CTRL ALT DEL, or any other way to open task manager or get to the desktop. These are somewhat minor bugs but are still bugs none the less. Overall I git it a 9/10. There are a few bugs in the game but it is still fun.","August 8, 2014","true","14.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you're looking for a fun and challenging campaign-based RCT, buy this one. If you want lots of mods and custom scenarios to toy with, buy 2. And last, if you want MORE mods, more realistic theme park recreations, water parks, zoo parks, and lots of sandbox coaster building, buy 3. I think all are good, but each has its strong points.\n\nBut anyways, this is the original RCT, with all the expansions and a bunch of fan-made tracks added on. To put it short, it's a good game. The only major problems with this version are its quirks when used with Windows 7 and 8. The game, from what I know, will only run in a square resolution unless you change the inner workings of the EXE. It can crash fairly often, for semi-random reasons. And my install sometimes glitches my desktop when I quit, forcing me to reboot.\n\nHowever, if you can look past some irritating glitches on newer OSes, then this is a must-have. For about the same price as a CD of the game, you get everything on it already on your hard drive, no CD insertion required. If you're a big RCT fan, then I'd say buy it.","July 17, 2014","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is incredible fun and keeps you wanting to play for just one more "month". It is the right level of challenging and casual fun. I cannot grant it higher than 8/10 because you aren't always compelled to return to it and elements of the gameplay are frustrating: for instance you can't make an actually interesting roller coaster without it being too "extreme", "unexciting" or "nausiating".\n\nStill a great deal of fun, with no real flaws.\n\nFor the casual "indie" gamer I would definately recomend this game.","July 9, 2014","true","39.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I bought the game at the full price of $6 because I decided I couldn't wait until it went on sale, and honestly I regret it.\n\nImmediately upon launching it for the very first time, it caused my laptop's video driver to crash.

Aside from using existing tools to create a park you can also create your own designs for Rollercoasters and edit map landscape . This game is extremely fun sandbox experience that is only limited by your creativity .\n\nThere is much depth to actually creating a good Rollercoaster . You have to consider things like intencity,drop speed,velocity,ride duration and how many people it can handle . Screw it up and the cart will go flying into the air or ram into another one killing innocent people .\n\nI acutally prefer this version to RollerCoaster2 because it has harder and more creative campaign missions (otherwise it is basicly same game with different maps and rides) So the way you progress through the game is by accomplishing objectives on 1-2 maps and it will unlock another map . Sometimes you will have little space to work with and may even have to build entire park on water .\n\nThe overall control panel in this game is very streight forward and easy to learn . You can jump into game without prior knowledge . Beside beeing a good game overall it also allows much customization like colors for rides,roads and lots of dicoration objects .\n\nThe only real problem is the fact that it may or may not work . Every computer reacts differently . I can't alt-tab and enter it again and making save files screws up my resolution settings .\n\nIf you never played any games in the series I highly recommend it .  Worst case sceneraio you can always refund it if it is not compitable with modern system but you should give it a try .","November 28, 2015","true","12.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Just hearing the sounds of the rides and people transports me to kings island, cedar point, six flags, and etc. If all the game did was drag me out of my winter blues would be enough to buy it but the gameplay takes it even farther. Designing your own coaster, testing it, watching people line up for it, and reading their thought bubbles on it is an added thrill. Make your coaster too scary no-one will ride it, make it twist and turn too much and you will be paying for extra handymen to clean up the mess.

I would spend countless hours ♥♥♥♥ing around with the rides, not even worrying about the objective. I would create glorious death traps and make the park rating tank. A few years went by and I started to move towards games like Halo and Uncharted and such. I grew apart from RCT and eventually misplaced the disc somewhere. Still have no idea where the hell it is. Fast forward to last week. I noticed a friend of mine was playing this game on Steam. At first I thought, "Oh, it's probably a non-Steam game that he was just playing through Steam." Oh god damn was I wrong. I immediately bought this and RCT2, downloaded them, and started this one up. It's just as fun as I remember, maybe even more. This game is a classic and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of fun. It allows me to use my cynical trolling ways against the A.I. and watch them suffer.

If you're looking for a fun and challenging campaign-based RCT, buy this one. If you want lots of mods and custom scenarios to toy with, buy 2. And last, if you want MORE mods, more realistic theme park recreations, water parks, zoo parks, and lots of sandbox coaster building, buy 3. I think all are good, but each has its strong points.\n\nBut anyways, this is the original RCT, with all the expansions and a bunch of fan-made tracks added on. To put it short, it's a good game. The only major problems with this version are its quirks when used with Windows 7 and 8. The game, from what I know, will only run in a square resolution unless you change the inner workings of the EXE. It can crash fairly often, for semi-random reasons. And my install sometimes glitches my desktop when I quit, forcing me to reboot.\n\nHowever, if you can look past some irritating glitches on newer OSes, then this is a must-have. For about the same price as a CD of the game, you get everything on it already on your hard drive, no CD insertion required. If you're a big RCT fan, then I'd say buy it.","July 17, 2014","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In the game they have many different parks you can build at with many different rides many of which allow you to build custom tracks. Lots of color customation, once had a tiger stripes themed amusement park. This game was made in 2000 so graphics are obviously no longer state-of-the-art but the game is well done and has almost no faults or glitches. In-game interface a little confusing but you learn it quickly. This game in my mind was the best of the entire Roller Coaster Tycoon series.

Your only limits are your imagination...... and amount of land..... and money. Okay, yes, there are limits. But the opportunity that it gives is everyone's fantasy, be it large, or small, to make their own rollercoaster and run their own theme park. The game is a massive time sponge, you WILL end up spending more time making just one rollercoaster than you thought, and it really takes into consideration about momentum and intertia so that when the coaster goes up a hill to create more intensity and fun for the guests, you're not going to lose momentum and roll all the way back down and hit the train behind the first one, and potentially kill someone.\n\nGo ahead and buy the first RCT to learn the ropes of theme park management, but I'd recommend you buy the third one afterwards.

That's probably the biggest reason, and I'll admit that my review will likely be tinged with it.\n\nRollerCoaster Tycoon is an old game. It's older than one of my teenage younger sisters, which is actually not as old as I thought. (I was pretty sure I was only a year or two old when this came out. I guess I was five, at least when the deluxe version came out.) The graphics are dated, the gameplay is very simple, and money is apparently a million times more valuable because it's the late 90's. (I'm kidding. Sort of. I mean, you do start out with only $10k, and you still have enough to buy a few rides, so clearly something is off with the value.)\n\nI didn't actually grow up with this game, as far as I can remember. My parents were big on the Tycoon and Sims franchises, but I either wasn't allowed to play them or didn't care about them. But when I found the CD a few years ago, I decided to boot it up and give it a try. I was not disappointed.\n\nThe game is really easy to pick up. You get some money, you get a clear objective (usually a number of guests and a certain park rating), and you get to work. The game is all about managing both your finances and guest happiness. The game makes it very easy to figure out what you need to do via guest feedback, and it's up to you to actually do it.\n\nJust because the game is simple, though, that doesn't mean it's boring or easy. Some of the later objectives get quite challenging, especially the park with no room for new rides. But even after you complete the challenges, it's still tons of fun to go back and continue to build up your park. You can have some pretty awesome parks going after four or five in-game years. Just sit back and watch the awards and the cash come flowing in!\n\nOh, and if guests don't like you, you can drown them. No one else notices or helps, either, which is both amusing and disturbing. But it's a great way to boost park rating in small doses, and it's a sick sort of amusement.\n\nSo, even if this game has no relevance to your childhood or your inner child, this still can be a fun game to go back to time and time again. Just make sure you set aside three hours or so for it. You will sit down, open the game, look at the clock, and realize that hours have gone by without you realizing it. That's why my playtime is so low on here--I've only gone back to it once, and I still accumulated over two hours of playtime. You can bet that I'll be playing it once the semester is over, however.\n\nP.S. As I mentioned, I still have the CD, but I saw this on here for under three bucks, so I decided to buy it. I didn't have the deluxe edition, so I got a bit more content, and the devs got some more money. It was a win-win.","November 30, 2015","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a really old game, but with the cost that it's currently at, it's well worth the price of admission. The main goal is to unlock all the maps by completing the set objectives by each individual map - obviously as time goes on, the maps get larger and larger and the potential for your park also grows.\n\nApart from that - it's up to you! There are freeform maps where there aren't any set objectives and you can literally go wild without needing to stop. I honestly started playing this game on the original original Xbox and sadly that particular game couldn't be transferred onto the 360, but, as usual, Steam came to my rescue and the experience is miles better and the game is just as engaging as it was when it originally came out. If you get the chance to give it a go, I certainly reccomend this based on the price and the sheer addiction that forces 23 hours out of your day to day life.\n\nAll good and nice, right? Well I have come across a pretty severe bug because for some reason after completing Trinity Islands last night, all my progress has been erased. Not my parks, but my progress; according to the game, I haven't completed one park, and yet according to my computer, I haven't lost a thing.
