Especially shooters. For the price you're paying you're getting disc free Japanese Shoot Em Up fun! The developers took lots of care to fix numerous bugs that plagued the original Japanese version. The most notable one was the improvement of how the textures are displayed. There are much much less flickering textures in this version over what I played on the PS2. And also it has some nice options that allow you to rotate your screen and play it as if you are playing on an actual arcade monitor. I know I've only played 30 minutes of this game, but I've already played the PS2 version and know much about this game to let you know it's worth the purchase price. One Gameplay Hint - You need to constantly play this game if you want to be successful and beat the game. I guess if you play often enough, your credit limit increases. Play the game enough and you won't have to worry about running out of continues again. If 2 credits ticks you off, consider giving yourself extra lives and bombs at the beginning to make up for the 2 credits per game. Worth the purchase.

I would recommend changing the keysettings immediately. And to do this you must go to the actual games folder and choose the config tool. I got no idea why they didn't include it in the game. Also, changing the screen to fullscreen in the same tool is highly recommended. This is an incredibly hard and unforgiving game, just like the arcades used to be.

I remember I would spend some cash to play this, and boy, is it hard!\n\nWith the digital release, you can choose to play the regular arcade mode, all 7 levels! There's also Score Attack mode, in which you try to set the highest score in a level, Boss Attack, in which you fight all the bosses of each level.\n\nIf you find the game too hard, don't be afraid to turn down the difficulty. You can also set the maximum amount of lives as well as the amount of bombs you start with!\n\nAnother good thing about this is that the soundtrack is also included with the game!\n\nThe only downsides of the game are that there aren't any achievements and you can only play in one resolution.

The mechanics are simple, 3 shot types- Red spread, Blue beam and Green swishy beam, the quicker you kill an enemy the more bonus score. So if you hit a wave as it enters the screen you get X2, a second or two later X1.6 etc.\n\nThe 3D background is old skool but ok although it doesnt  add anything gameplay wise.  The bosses, so far, are OK but not Raidens best and the gimmick green beam is good but not as cool as R2s purple snakey beam.\n\nAlthough it isnt as pure as Raiden original or as deep, varied and totally the best vertical smup ever made as Raiden Fighters Jet its entertaining enough. If you enjoy a non bullet hell old skool shooter think about buying this, and grab it next sale for sure.  In the mean time get MAME and play RFJ till your eyes scream and your hair bleeds. Oh and dont bother if you dont have a controller, but since you like arcade shooters you do.... unless your weird, superhuman or like not getting past the first level of games.\n\nBig thanks to Hermski for gifting me this game!\n\n","July 10, 2015","true","3.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

You basically control a ship and are fighting against an unknown alien threat. It is a standard plot.\n\nGraphics: The graphics hold up well considering that this game originally came out in 2005. The leap from 2D to 3D graphics does the game well, allowing for dynamic camera angles for the background as well as giving the ships and energy beams much greater detail than before.\n\nSound: The soundtrack in this game is fantastic. As you play through each level, adrenaline pumping music blasts through the speakers with electronic sounds and bass combining to give you the feeling you are back in the loud arcades of the 90's.\n\nGameplay: Raiden III shines the brightest when it comes to gameplay. It is fast, addictive and challenging. This game will really test your skill, patience and above all, reflexes as you try to maneuver around each level to dodge incoming bullets and enemy ships. It is alot of fun.\n\nOverall, I love playing Raiden III. The game harks back to a time when games were simple to play, only requiring you to use a few buttons at a time. I think this works really for this type of game since it requires lightning fast reflexes for you to beat the game.\n\nAn arcade classic.\n\n8/10","June 4","true","2.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

They're well made and good score attack fun but they don't redefine the genre like say, Ikaruga did. Raiden III continues this tradition. Unfortunately, the PC conversion of this game is not particularly good, very strange indeed when you consider that it originally ran on PC-based arcade hardware. It's locked at 640x480 resolution with scalable windowed options available and while it still looks OK, it's dated resolution shows. It also does support controllers but not natively and you'll have to manually do all the bindings in the separate configuration utility. There's no online play or online leaderboards either. That said, this game will run on a potato and plays great with the keyboard so it's perfect for low powered laptops and the like.\n\nIt's an exact recreation of 2005's original arcade game, including local co-op and with some additional features that originally came in the PS2 version, such as Boss Rush and Score Attack. You also can save replays and some high-level play from what I presume the developers comes pre-loaded.\n\nThe core Raiden games are good but don't feature as advanced a scoring system as the Raiden Fighters series, nor do they have multiple ships you can select. You get one standard ship with bombs and a few different weapons you can pick up during play. It's not complicated but the simplicity is where the core Raiden games shine. They're good shmups that anyone can pick up and play and get good at with a minimal amount of practice. Even if you're a casual player, there's a lot to like here.\n\nPersonally, given that this is only one game and a weak conversion, I think it's too expensive at full price but on sale, it's a no brainer. If you're looking to spend $10, I'd recommend Raiden Legacy (which is not on Steam sadly but is on GOG and Green Man Gaming), which is a very well put together collection of several past Raiden titles. Raiden IV Overkill is also apparently a much better (though more expensive) PC version but I have not played it at time of writing.","December 3, 2015","true","0.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I hate windowed games.\n\nThrough trial and error, the controls are:\nArrow Keys = directional controls, duh.\nZ = Main fire weapon\nX = Bombs\nEnter = Menu, pause\n\nUnder options in game, there is a save/load feature.  I finished playing the first stage very clumsily with the keyboard and tried to access the save feature through the pause menu.  It exited me out of the game!  Checked the options again since Auto Save was on, loaded the last save, no dice...Game started over...  Ugh.  Anyone figure out the key for manual save during a game??

Cheap when on sale compared to the rare Xbox 360 disc based version.  Bad port to Steam.\n\nI do really enjoy the soundtrack though.

So beware that it may or may not work with your system.","December 14, 2014","false","2.3"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

It's pretty much like Raiden II but with upgraded scenery, which can confuse you a bit as your jet moves further into the level. I had to do a bit of keymap tweaking, but that was simple, just run the config tool before you start the game (it will give you this option on startup). The screen size doesnt really bother me, I just magnified it once. It's a pretty fun game and very nostalgic, fans of Raiden should try it out.

There's even a practice mode where none of the enmies shoot; perfect for if you just want to kick back, relax and blow stuff up without all of the stress of bullet dodging at the end of the day.\n\nJust be sure to launch "config" (before launching the game) so that you can map the keys to the controller and choose the full screen option (otherwise you'll be playing it in a window with no controller support)...\n\n...I know, that kind of sucks?
