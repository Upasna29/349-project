For the sake of being able to post I will recommend the game as the game itself is a good game, but this practice of keeping consumers in the dark needs to stop! So if you are a new customer who doesn't own Darksiders 2 just ignore the rest I am about to write for the game is excellent and Vigil Games deserves your money in order to make Darksiders 3. Now If you already own Darksiders 2 then save your money and redeem your free key through this web page. http://ds2dekeyredeem.nordicgames.at/\nI had no idea this was even a thing and I really wish I was informed of this, but sadly I found out about this just now after a friend got his free copy. Nordic Games not mentioning this for Steam users is shady as all Helheim and it is obvious they did this to score more sales out of us loyal fans by keeping us in the dark about this while also making themselves feel smug and charitable by having a web page at all. I mean just look at the damn web page!

It doesn't have new content whatsoever, but offers better experience. And yes, definitely better in every aspects than the original Darksiders 2. Graphically it's good, and when you max it the game's very good looking. I am playing with 840m toaster-like graphic card and have decent FPS so far with all maxed settings. Though, the game still suffers from random stuttering even when I'm using public beta, but so far so good, not that horrible. Crashes from ALT+TAB-ing also still present, but hopefully it will be fixed.\n\nThe game is made with controller in mind, so you'd be better off playing with controller. Dinput controller isn't supported, but you can x360ce it. Xinput is supported natively.\n\nThis version does NOT need any DLC purchased to get full experience, as everything is integrated. The only DLC being sold is OST, which is in 320 kbps, and it's the same as OST DLC from previous title.\n\nAs a whole, there are things that must be addressed notably performance issues, but as it stands it deserves thumbs up from me.\n\nHere's wishing Darksiders 3 coming for real.","November 14, 2015","true","15.7"," 160 of 187 people (86%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","86","160","187","12","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atrumruina/recommended/388410/","atrumruina","Atrum Ruina","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atrumruina/","172 products in account","Darksiders and its sequel remain some of my favorite games from the previous generation. The first game was clearly and deliberately derivative of some of the best titles in history, Zelda and God of War chief among them. The dungeon crawling and puzzles were top notch, as was the sense of progression and the combat, while simple, was visceral and satisfying in a way that Zelda's never was. As important, however, was the story which was filled with engaging characters and a lore that was much more interesting than something based on Biblical mythology (not an uncommon road to tread) had any right to be. War, Samael, Vulgrim, Ulthane and Uriel were all extremely memorable characters.\n\nAnd oh, that ending.\n\nDarksiders II was one of the first games in years I'd preordered. I was looking forward to the game largely because I honestly never thought it would come when I finished the first game. Somehow, in spite of all of that anticipation, I was not disappointed. The world that Darksiders II presents is incredible. It isn't vast or filled to the brim with random events like many open world games; in essence, it's not one; but it is absolutely beautiful in its creativity and heart. It's clear that the game was crafted with care and that the developers and artists weren't just making set pieces but building something beyond the ruined Earth we see in the first game -- a world apart from the one we know.\n\nThe game expands on many concepts from the original. The combat is less heavy than the original's but is sped up considerably, with Death feeling more akin to Dante than Kratos which is very fitting for his lithe appearance. The fixed equipment from the original is replaced by a randomized loot system -- one of the game's few missteps, as this results in a less satisfying feeling of progression or, when all  is said and done, completion.\n\nThe story remains engaging, introducing a whole slew of new characters with some familiar faces resurfacing throughout. The only negative is that the ending feels a bit lackluster as it doesn't really progress the story significantly from the original, though there are heavy implications for what's to come next.\n\nThat all leads me to the Deathinitive Edition. The launch of the game was marred somewhat by a crashing issue which was resolved within a day of release and a large swath of people complaining because their discount was less than others'. Removing those non-issues, the DE itself stands as a fantastic rendition and a worthy upgrade to the original. The implementation of the DLC weapons and armor make them feel like real, substantial items in the game world rather than throwaway trinkets which are useless within a few hours' gametime. I would have liked the Story DLC to somehow have been implemented directly into the campaign however I see how that would have been difficult.\n\nPerformance, after some beta patches and hotfixes, has been noticeably improved over the original and the game looks GORGEOUS by comparison. Initially, the picture may come off as a bit less saturated and in some areas that's simply the case (the opening of the game is the most heavily impacted by this so far, I think) but much of this is due to the much more realistic lighting. Overall, I think it adds depth and a slight touch of realism that really makes the game's world breathe. A simple improvement is that metallic objects now have a metallic sheen -- it's incredible how much this small change has impacted the visuals but in an odd way it adds weight and density to Death's armor and weapons.\n\nOverall, I can't recommend this version enough, especially to current owners who currently get an extremely steep discount. For new owners, this is still among the best games of last generation and this is simply the best version of the game available. I'm really excited to see what Nordic and Gunfire do with this series moving forward.","November 10, 2015","true","21.2"," 126 of 152 people (83%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","83","126","152","5","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/388410/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3342 products in account","THQ’s demise sent ripples through the industry, but few felt it as keenly as Vigil Games. They had just released Darksiders II, and things were looking up for the studio as they started work on Warhammer 40,000: Dark Millennium. And suddenly everything went pear shaped. A bidding war for the individual studios and their intellectual properties emerged as THQ began to fold. Zero bids were made for Vigil or its IP, much to everyone’s surprise. Crytek swooped in post-collapse and formed a new studio called Crytek USA, snapping up many ex-Vigil folks in the process.\n\nUnfortunately, Vigil’s luck didn’t hold as Crytek’s own financial woes were visited upon the new crew. In early 2014, founder David Adams and 20 of his core team members left and founded their own studio — a chance to take control of their destiny once again. Hooking up with the owners of the Darksiders IP, Nordic Games, the first objective of the newly-formed Gunfire Games was plainly visible — Remastering Darksiders II. Could this re-introduction pave a path to continue the fantastic storyline, or is Darksiders II Deathinitive Edition just another bump on a very rough road for this team?\n\nPrior to the events of the first game, Earth is desolate. One of the four horsemen, War, has been condemned by the council – his judgement soon to be passed. He was beckoned to the human realm, but there was no call; leading to the extinction of the human race, and destruction and demonic renovation of the realm. Death, War’s brother, believes him to be innocent, and willing to do anything to prove him as such, he seeks the Crowfather, keeper of many secrets, so he may find his brother’s redemption.Things go awry and Death is defeated; his former trinket bearing unreaped souls broken, embedded into his chest, and sent away to the realm of the Makers. He seeks the Tree of Life for answers, but the land is plagued by Corruption.\n\nDarksiders II may have a greater focus on story than the first, and its dialogue and writing are superb, but it’s practically nonexistent. The story lacks any sense of urgency, making it stale and unexciting. There’s not much to look forward to when progressing the story except visiting new locales and new dungeons. Even when the story picks up and begins to catch your interest, it’s predictable and you might be caught up in the numerous side quests. It’s too simplistic and follows the paradigms of Action-Adventure games a la Legend of Zelda (go from point A to point B to acquire item A to open door Z).\n\nWhat Darksiders II does accomplish is having a likeable protagonist with exceptional delivery. Voiced by Michael Wincott, Death is a cynical, witty, and overall charming character. He constantly engages in banter with the other characters, eliciting a few chuckles here and there and shining some light on an otherwise boring and dreary story. His motivations are unclear, however. While he does have a rationale for why he must put a stop to the big bad, it’s never stated why he fights for his brother’s innocence. Whether it’s for brotherly love or for his sense of justice, it’s left up to the interpretation of the player, harming the integrity of the story and its writers.\n\nIt’s also worth mentioning the change in scenery is quite vast in Darksiders II as compared to the first. While the first game took place in a post-apocalyptic city, the Makers’ realm explored in this entry is much more fantasy. It feels odd transitioning between two radically different settings, and while there may be some answers as to who’s who and what’s what from the first game, it would be better if it were left ambiguous and saved for a later entry. It changes up much of what the first Darksiders established and creates even more questions, such as why some characters are where they are now.\n\nDarksiders as a series has always attempted to mimic other franchises. From gameplay reminiscent of God of War, dungeon exploring akin to the Legend of Zelda, climbing and wall running similar to Prince of Persia, and a loot system nearly ripped from Diablo, DSII does much to accentuate itself from the imitated franchises. New to Darksiders II are its RPG mechanics. While the first game played like a normal Hack ‘n Slash where you merely traversed lands and were only rewarded with currency upon defeating enemies, the world has been opened up for greater exploration and you now gain EXP in order to level up.\n\nDeath is much more nimble and acrobatic than War, the tutorial will prove. He’s much faster, has a longer dodge distance, and his moves are more extravagant and his arsenal versatile. Given the loot system, Death has a larger variety of sub-weapons. From bucklers and arm blades with swift strikes, to hammers and axes with slow swings, you are given more options in how you may want to arm yourself. This offers some layer of adaptability for the player, allowing them to choose a specific playstyle. Depending on weight classification, they mostly have unique moves but come sub-varieties, they aren’t much different apart from charge attacks. This is lackluster, despite the initial concept being a welcome one.\n\nOnce you’ve acquired enough experience points, Death will level up. When done, not only will his base stats like ATK and DEF increase, but he will also receive a skill point. New to the game is the implementation of the skill tree, where these new points may be invested into so to acquire new skills and power them up. However, this tree is split into two categories: physical magic, focused on attacks and buffing your stats, and normal magic or spellcasting, dependent on your MP and scaling with a stat called Arcane.\n\nIt’s worth mentioning some of my problems with how Death handles. While combat is greatly diversified with the introduction of the loot and equipment system, after a few hours of play, it’s revealed just how shallow the combat is. Even after acquiring new moves, I still found myself using the same, few tricks throughout my playthrough. Enemies were impossible to stagger, the only ounce of difficulty coming because of that. Being a Hack ‘n Slash, a genre known for pulling off crazy combos, it’s unfortunate, as the action loses its momentum as a result.\n\nDeath also seems to have problems when scaling and running on walls. His movements feel sluggish and unresponsive to player input; taking about 0.5 sec before he’ll do what you commanded him, causing some headaches in certain sections of the game. While some rubble and walls may seem like they can be scaled, Death seems to be unable to. There are invisible walls, shrouded by debris of fallen ruin placed where you may not need to go and even some minor walls in accessible areas aren’t climbable without the grips indicating climbable sections. It’s annoying and inconvenient, especially grating considering that Death is capable of much greater acrobatic feats.\n\nPossibly the most memorable part of Darksiders II: Deathinitive Edition are its visuals and soundtrack. Come the Deathinitive edition of the game, textures have vastly been improved and new lighting has been implemented for much more seamless and beautiful environments than the original. While this update to visuals wasn’t necessary (as the game was already gorgeous), it lends to a fantastic representation of the merits of a more stylized artstyle, especially in a saturated market of more realistic games. The orchestrated score in the game is phenomenal. It lends an ‘epic’ feeling to the game, making it more immersive and more like an actual journey. It sets a tone for the story, and while the player experience may vary, Death’s fight for his brother’s redemption is undoubtedly felt through the music.\n\nDarksiders II is one of the more memorable Hack and Slash titles with breathtaking, mythical settings supported by interesting characters, fascinating lore, and snappy gameplay.","April 19","true","49.6"," 53 of 60 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","53","60","3","3"

Some quick comments.\n\n- The graphics are indeed much improved. Crisp, clean, and the cel-shaded inspired art style is lovely with the overhauled lighting.\n\n-The music, as in the original version of this game, is outstanding, and easily some of Jesper Kyd's best work. Equal parts gothic and celtic inspirations make the soundtrack well worth remembering.\n\n-The voice acting, and the characterization of Death in particular, is exceptional. My biggest issue with the original Darksiders was that War was basically a grimdark Space Marine. Death, on the other hand, is always handy with a bit of much needed snark, sarcasm, and even the occasional moment of sensitivity. This is the reaper as I like to envision him.\n\n- The gameplay is quick, satisfyingly punchy, and has a gentle learning curve with a high plateau. Playing with various specs and active abilities is quite enjoyable, and finding an upgrade for your equipment is always nice.\n\nOverall, I would wholeheartedly recommend the Deathinitive Edition for newcomers to the series. For anyone who already owns and has played the original release of the game, you will not find anything new here, but revisiting a fine game in revised form is very enjoyable.","November 13, 2015","true","0.8"," 55 of 73 people (75%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","75","55","73","6","0"

Unless you truly think it's worth to buy this after already having the original, then I would say wait until it's on sale (Like right now, it's only 2.99) Still, the game itself is gr8 and should deserve more recognition.  It makes me sad to see that the reviews are mixed, and that it might make people not buy the game in fear of the reviews.

Ill make it short and to the point.\n\nPros+\n- It does look better cleaner and more crisp then original\n- They intergrated the dlc so it feels like one continuous game.\n- Nordic Games is listening to community.(Will explain a little more in detail later.)\n- It feels fresh even though ive played it before.\n- They really all around polished the game took things out added small things to make its a overall better experience.\n\nCons-\n- It has some annoying bugs. BUT and its a big BUTT Nordic Games seems to be working on fixing the problems asap.\n- If you own it all youll prolly have to pay 6 dollars for the upgrade. Im putting that in cons just to be an ♥♥♥.\n- Its the original game so if you cant stand playing remasters of a game youll prolly not enjoy yourself.\n\nOk on a serious note id give this game a 8/10 Its a good game. It has bugs and it could have been bad really bad if Nordic Games didnt fix game breaking buggs and crashes next day. But they hot fixed the crashing on a broad scale. Yes you have to spend money on what you already own basically 6 dollars. WHO cares some people got it for free its 6 dollars I spend more money for 15 minutes of happiness(food) then this game that has actually kept me entertained for a couple hours now. Nordic Games seems to be working hard on fixing issues with the game. I mean 90% of companies dont give a ♥♥♥♥ about us pc community and get around to fixing issues eventually if ever. If you cannot stand to spend 6 dollars to support a game dont buy it its pretty simple. I mean xbox 1 and ps4 had to pay full price for their copy even if they owned all the dlc and stuff but thats ok. PC master race mentality, I used to take pride in our pc community but all we are doing is turning to be worse then the console ♥♥♥♥♥es. Yes we get shafted way to much but take out your anger on companies that dont give a ♥♥♥♥. Do I think this is worth the money YES to others no. So if you took the time to read this make youre own choice dont lets bias opinions sway you one way or another. But if you dont get the game death will come to your house with war and woop your ♥♥♥ so meh enjoy the beating if you dont get this game.....

The game used to look nice but the the textures always were an eyesore. Now however, with the updated graphics in this one, it really is looking awesome. Much better than I expected when I saw the patch notes.\n\nThe downside is that its a lot more demanding to run now. I am getting about 70 FPS with everything maxed on 1440p resolution. For most people this will not be an issue, but I thought it was worth mentioning since I recall the original running much better. I have a GTX980, 8GB ram and a 4790K Intel CPU. I am playing the game at less than Max shadows just and am getting about 90 FPS.\n\nOne of the major flags for this game is that its not a very good console port. The FOV is set to less than 60, and it has caused me plenty of migraines making it neigh unplayable. This alone would have made me give it a not recommended review, but recently I found that there are cheat engine tables made by the community that let you change the FOV to something more manageable, and It has made the game playable for me. So people who get motion sickness need to be aware that on default settings, this will make you sick. However using the cheat table is a workaround that does work.\n\nOnce you can get past these problems, Darksiders 2 is really an awesome game underneath. I love the story, the art design, and most of all the voice acting. The gameplay is very fast faced, and the maps are huge with little to no loading times. I am not quite sure if it is worth purchasing at full price, if you already have Deathsiders 2, but if you don't, then I would heartily recommend purchasing and playing this game.\n\nI see a lot of people saying that Nordic should have offered the game for free to everyone who had Darksiders 2, and not just an 80% off discount. Or that they should have better ways to check for DLC since a lot of people bought it individually and not in a pack. While I can agree with this sentiment, I still think its a bit harsh to blame Nordic for this. Their last publisher went bankrupt and they spent a lot of cash to buy back the rights for this game and got most of their team together. Calling this game a patch that should have been free is simply wrong. It makes a massive difference to the look of the game, and I for one am glad they did it even if I would have had to purchase this game again.\n\nEdit: Made an edit following the second patch that fixes the mouse sensitivity in aim mode.","November 13, 2015","true","24.3"," 26 of 34 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","26","34","2","0"

I bought the complete pack, hence I was upgraded to Deathfinitive. I pity those who were loyal from the beginning and bought each DLC seperately, it doesn't see fair, really.\n\nHowever, this game is epic, it's huge and beautiful, it's not just the deathfinitive of Darksiders, it's the definitive of so many other games in the same genre e.g. Prince of Persia, DMC, Zelda, etc...\n\nI think the game is really underrated, I've found the game to be accessible and challenging, I have had to checkout a walkthrough or two and haven't finished the game, but I certainly keep coming back and find that the game is quite relaxing, rather than frustrating.\n\nThe maps are big, the story is straightforward and the voice acting is superb. The gameplay is typical with some neat additions like grappling, summoning, clone thingies, etc..\n\nAll I have to say is if you a new to this game you won't,be dissapointed and I'm really sorry to those who were loyal from the beginning, sincerely.","January 3","true","15.1"," 20 of 26 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","20","26","0","0"

However I'd say if you're the type to want the best possible performance out of your games you may not get a great experience out of the "Deathinitive" edition of Darksiders II. The game still feels a little sluggish overall and I'd only recommend this game if you can overlook that. Given the recommended system specs for this game I think it should run a great deal smoother than it actually does.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\nI honestly wish I could recommend this game. They've fixed the crash to desktop bug that a great deal of reviews were negative for but one thing they've yet to fix is the game's overall performance. The fps drops and stutter in places are supremely annoying to the point where it's barely playable.\n\nThis review will be subject to change depending on if/when Nordic decide to fix the performance issues but currently I simply would not recommend this game.","November 8, 2015","false","1.7"," 90 of 152 people (59%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","59","90","152","9","0"

Darksiders II is a Borderlands of 3rd person action games, it incorporates full skill trees, leveling and loot systems while preserving fun combat and puzzle solving from the original. It still has some flaws/drawbacks, some of them are still there from the first part, which is really disappointing, but overall it's a pretty original and one-of-a-kind tittle currently on the market which makes it a pretty much must play for any 3rd person action fan.\n\nI'll list some of the most prominent positive/negative points along with a couple of neutral ones.\n\nPositive:\nFun combat system with variety of weapons and options to destroy your foes.\n2 Full skill trees, basically warrior and mage build with variety of skills to choose from.\nGood diablo-styled loot system with a ton of randomly generated items along with some Legendary items to obtain.\nPossessed Weapon system which lets you craft a weapon you desire by feeding it with other items.\nCool dungeon design with many puzzles to solve and secrets to find along your path.\nSemi-open world with a bunch of locations, huge and small.\nMany enemies, bosses and even some rare creatures to fight, much less "recolors" than in previous part, basically every part/map of the game features it's own unique enemies.\nA battle arena called The Crucible with 100 waves of enemies and a secret boss.\nNG+ where you can level up Death even further, try other build and find more powerful items.\nNeutral:\nSub-weapon variety could be better, it's better than in Darksiders but still kind of lackluster in my eyes, although some people might find it sufficient.\nMove list could be wider, but again some people might think it's more than enough.\nMany side quests, but they are a chore to do usually, although you get awesome rewards for doing most of them.\nStory is sub par, it just here to entertain you to some degree.\nGraphically and stylistically it's the same as predecessor, it looks cool, but I personally think that it doesn't fit "Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse" theme much. To each their own, I suppose.\nNegative:\nDifficulty level is pretty low, after 1st chapter you won't find much challenge and Death just snowballs out of control.\nNG+ attributes such as health/wrath steal makes game even easier.\nCollectibles. Tons of them. I usually like to find hidden stuff especially in this kind of games, but man, they overdid it this time. There are more then 250 collectible items in this game, some of them are obscurely hidden and trust me - even if you'll try your best to find them, in the end there will be a dozen that you've missed and good luck figuring out which one of them you actually missed... It could be "okay" if those were just filler collectibles like in Dead Island for instance, but you'll get awesome rewards and achievements. I am not saying collectibles are bad, I just think there're just way too many of them.\nPuzzles are dumbed down, Darksiders got me thinking really hard on some of it's puzzles, while in Darksiders II I don't even remember a really tough puzzle where I had to think more than a few seconds before solving it.\nAlthough there is a teleport option to move between locations, moving around dungeons, especially big ones could be a chore since Death runs kind of slow and ultimately you'll find yourself using "dodge" move over and over again just to speed up the process.\nOverall it's a good and somewhat original 3rd person action with decent replayability. Definitely a must play for the fans of this genre.\n\n8/10.\n\nDeathinitive Edition Review\nI don't think there was a necessity to make a remaster for this game since it's not that old and it ran 1080p@60FPS on PC anyway.\n\nJust recently did a NG+ run on a new difficulty level, I'll just state my observations here:\n\nTextures look much better now.\nLighting changed in many areas, causes some flickering and glitches sometimes.\nMenus/UI is more responsive now. Loads faster.\nAll previous DLC items are now unique drops from certain bosses and/or hidden chests, weapons are now scales with your level. Some of the DLC weapons changed to possessed weapons.\nDLC campaigns unlocks after a certain boss has been defeated.\nLess loot drops from chests.\nDeathinitive difficulty level is not much of a challenge for a NG+ character, harder for a NG character though.\nPoor optimization. Frame drops in certain locations for no apparent reasons.\nCrashes on damaging multi-hit abilities/moves. You can definitely complete the game but fighting in The Crucible could be a pain. As of 01.12.2015 it's still hasn't been fixed.\nA decent remaster, but needs some fixes before it could be really good. I thinks it's a shame that they pulled vanilla off of steam store before finalizing this release.","December 2, 2015","true","21.0"," 24 of 37 people (65%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","65","24","37","4","0"

And it is actually quite visually impressive compared to the regular version.

I got this game for $3 on ♥♥♥ anyways, so I ended up paying $15. Not bad,\n\nI absolutely LOVE Darksiders, so Deathinitive Edition was the perfect excuse to play them again; I had the first one on Steam too, so I'm playing it right now before I go into DS2DE. If you read reviews and comments everywhere, people seem to be having LOTS of problems with the game, so I wanted to try and see if that was true. At first the game ran absolutely broken, with insane stuttering and 15FPS even in 720p with no shadows, AA nor AO. Having a Skylake 2.5Ghz i7 and a GTX970M, that was absolutely impossible to believe. So, I downloaded the original DS2 (As I still have it on my library) and surprising enough, the game ran like ♥♥♥♥ as well. So after all the troubleshooting, I decided to roll back to the last MSI certified drivers for this PC (353.74) just because that was my last TS step... and now the game runs at solid 90FPS 90% of the time, 1080p, full shadows, AA and AO.\n\nSo, in the end, it was a driver problem! I don't know how many of you are having problems with this, but if you're one of them, please try using older drivers, as it seems that Nvidia's latest are ♥♥♥♥. Dunno about AMD users tho, but for me this did the trick.\n\nOh, and these games are amazing, please do yourself a favor and play them.

Bought the original and even with a couple problems thought it was a great game except for the really low rez textures, now they have fixed that with this version . The new lighting and better shadows make the game look much better.\n\nI am not having a huge problem with stuttering, the only times it happens for me is when I go into a new area or the game saves. Their are a couple of things that will reduce the stuttering  to almost completely gone.  One is setting maximum pre-rendered fames to 1 in the Nvidia control panel under Manage 3d Settings, another is to foece Vsync through Nvidia control panel under Mange 3d Settings and turn off vsync in game. I think the in game Vsync is addaptive Vsync.\n\nAlso the high anti aliasing setting is broken, so you will need to set it to medium, the devs have said this will be fixed in the next patch.\n\nSome people are upset about not getting it free even though they bought all the content that is in the franchise pack. Well Idid too but I got them really cheap.

Yes, its distribution was a bit... weird and I paid 6 bucks myself, desprite owning it already. Yeah, 6 bucks, buuhuu, what a loss...\n\nSeriously though, lets talk about the game:\nDarksiders 2 in general is a great game. If you enjoyed the first Darksiders, you will like this one too. I still prefer the first one, since the odd item system feels out of place and the story isnt as gripping. The gameplay is fun though and playing Wars more agile brother has a neat, very different feel to it. I was never any good at blocking, so the dodge-centered approach comes natural to me. The artstyle is beautiful, the environments are diverse for the most parts and the world and lore are very well made. I really like the whole Hell-Heaven-Apocalypse-stuff, because it takes all the cool myths of christianity without adding the boring parts (looking at you, new testament).\n\nSo in short:\n+ very satisfying combat\n+ gorgeous artstyle\n+ great world/lore\n+ You play as one of the four horsemen!!\n\n- story drags on sometimes\n- awkward, diablo-like item-system\n\nThe Deathinitive Edition:\nNow, what's different with the new version. First of all, the DLCs are fully included and woven into the main game, making them feel like natural parts of the game, which is the best a DLC can hope for. The visuals are enhanced too, but you wouldn't notice that unless you really look for it. The best thing might be the overhauled loot-distribution, that makes the obsolete item-system a bit less out of place. The menus are still awful though. Man, why doesn't anyone put any thought in menus any more...\n\nSo, all in all, if you havent played Darksiders before, play the first one, love it, come back and play the second game too. If you have played the first and have not played this one... seriously? what the hell is wrong with you? If you own Darksiders 2 already, you don't have to get the update. I think it was worth my 6 bucks, but i am a bit of a fanboy.","November 15, 2015","true","16.6"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","14","20","0","0"

Doesn't deviate much from the first Darksiders apart from adding loot drops and the added layer of character customization that such a system would bring. If you haven't yet played Darksiders II, this is a definite buy. Just an overall fun game that may not do anything new, but delivers a very enjoyable experience that very few can dislike. It's a very gamey game, and a good one at that.\n\nUnless you're really jonesing to play it one more time, it may not add enough for people who have already played through the regular Darksiders II. It's noticeably better looking and the folks at Nordic did a respectable job of modernizing its visuals, but beyond that it's still the same game. See for yourself if it's worth it.\n\nMany of the negative reviews surrounding the game are a result of the way its developer handled the way it gave loyalty bonuses to previous owners of DSII. I didn't have any issues buying this edition as I didn't own any of the DLC. Those who did own all content for the original game but bought it piecemeal rather than in the Bundle were upset they didn't get the game for free like those who did the latter. Could've been handled better, but in the end it's small fee for the fans, especially if you'd like to see a Darksiders III.\n\nThe game does carry over some of the bugs of the original, unfortunately, and doesn't appear to be well optimized to run on a broad range of machines, but the developer has been doing an admirable job of pushing out updates since its launch a couple of days ago to address the game's issues. I personally don't have any performance issues, but I've got a somewhat beefy system so I can't really comment too much on this.","November 9, 2015","true","8.7"," 21 of 35 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","21","35","0","0"

I highly doubt you'll be disappointed, especially when it's on sale.  If you already own it, there's nothing new here (save for an even higher difficulty setting) that warrants another purchase but it does look nicer than before.\n\nPros:\nFun hack n' slash\nGreat voice acting\nThe artwork\nEngrossing storyline\nThe Kingdom of the Dead (I would pay serious $$$ for another extended adventure there, and even more if it got brought to the Oculus or the Vive)\nPost-apocalyptic Earth\nDat soundtrack by Jesper KydCons\nGlitchy\nKB/Mouse controls not always clearly depicted in interface\nEnemies have predictable patterns\nLater stages of the game are shorter, giving it a rushed feeling\nA little heavy on the fetch quests\nWhat, you want more?  Okay then, but know that there's no possible way I can be objective about this game.  I've put over 150 hours into the original.  I loved it so much, I was happy to buy it again when Nordic released the Deathinitive edition.  I even bought the soundtrack.  On CD.  From Amazon.  Because that was the only place I could pay for it at the time.  Yeah, it was that bad.\n\nSee, I loved the art, the world and especially the STORY of the original Darksiders so when the sequel was announced, I was eager to get my hands on it and eager to see what would be done with Death.  Darksiders II brought everything I wanted and a whole lot more.  Where Darksiders I was pretty straightforward hack and slash, Darksiders II brings a richer, deeper world that invited exploration and a more meandering playthrough.  Where power was gained strictly through item collection in Darksiders, Darksiders II brought a bit of a role-playing element in with character levels and a reworked loot and ability system.  And where War was a straight-up Determinator[tvtropes.org], Death is a more complicated character, with a wry-sense of humor delivered with pitch-perfect gravelly voice acting.  For me, the art, the monumental soundtrack (so good I need to hit it twice in this review), the cinematic set pieces and the sweeping plot arc of the story all added up to a game that was much, much greater than the sum of its parts.  Little wonder I've spent more than a solid week's worth of time playing it.\n\nI'm sure I'm coming off as more than a bit of a fanboy here, and it's a fair cop.  I'm also sure that the Darksiders franchise isn't everyone's cup of tea and I won't begrudge anyone their preferences on that front.  But that said, and just for the record, if Nordic decides to get the band back together and make another sequel, I'm there.  Buying the Collector's edition.  Even if I don't know how they plan to top Death's story with Strife or Fury.  Don't care.  Hell, if I lived near the dev team I'd probably bring them coffee and pizza or other reasonably-priced alternatives in my free time.  You can practically hear me squeeing with glee at the very idea of it now.","April 13","true","9.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","5","5","2","0"

At times the game felt like it was just throwing more and more enemies at you to try and make it harder, but mastering dodging and fighting system it ended up feeling like it wasn't just being unfair but that i simply just weren't familiar enough with it at the time.\n- The game is very visually appealing and runs fairly well. getting about 70 to 90 fps, with maxed shadow quality and no antialiasing, on a 970 running a 1440p screen, which is reasonable compared to other games.\n- The only issue i have is that tabbing out can do one of three things, 1. Nothing. 2. Break sounds making only some sounds play and the rest of the time leave you in silence. 3. Crash the game. i'd recommend either playing the game in windowed, or downloading the "Windowed borderless gaming" app, since the game does not support borderless windowed on its own.\n- The game has a random loot drop system which i don't feel the game needs at all. It scaled weirdly and doesn't give you much freedom. For the most part it's just: sell your old junk at the vendor and then buy the item with the highest damage or highest defense. You get given special items sometimes when finding secrets or defeating bosses, but because of the nature of the leveling and scaling of the items, they almost immediately become useless or are already useless when you get them. There's a bit of health steal, and critical hit values you can take into account near the end, but it just feel like the game would have been better without the random loot and leveling.\n- Since the game has a leveling system it also has skill points. Which i don't understand, at all. It starts you off with 2 choices, giving you almost no points to do what you want, but when you get further into the game it you suddenly have too many skill points to use on skill you don't want, and can't really use anyways because of the energy system. I would much rather have seen some kind of cooldown, but even then it would feel like they are stepping away from what works to try to appeal to a broader audience.\n- As far as i can tell, all the secret achievements are just: "complete this, beat this, do this" and you should get them all from just playing the game, they're just hidden to not spoil the game i assume.\n\nBut sadly, despite my love of the game at the start it drops off near the end, even feeling like a chore at times.\n-Almost all puzzles are thrown out of the window, it has 2 puzzle areas in the last 2(and a half) worlds, where as the first 2 probably had about 10-20 each.\n-One of the puzzle mechanics it adds is really just super disorienting, but could still easily just be beaten with trial and error, it didn't feel great at all, it wasn't even obvious that i was progressing, i was just running back and forth being confused, only to suddenly be done.\n-It straight up has a third person shooter area. The world doesn't have any puzzles at all, it's just your running around with a gun shooting large hoardes of monsters with a really mechanicly broken gun. The area can be beaten with melee combat but it doesn't feel like that was taken into consideration or tested for at all. And even if you do use the gun, the enemies actively try to get behind you, making you have to take your eyes off of about 20 enemies to deal with one enemy punching you in the back, only to leave you surrounded. The controls for the aiming on controller are also terrible might i add, it's either moving wasy too slow or way too fast, there is no midpoint. It would probablt be a lot better with mouse and keyboard, but the entirety of the the rest of the game plays a lot better with controller, and there is no easy way to change from keyboard to controller without restarting the game.\n-Through the last 2,5 worlds with about 10 puzzles it has 5 bosses, where as one of them is repeated 3 times in the shooting segment. Neither of them really felt good to play. It didn't feel like i was learing attack patterns, and finding out when to attack, it felt like i was throwing my head against the wall again and again untill i won.\n- Random enemies would be boss level hard for no reason, with one of the summoning a massive rapidfire stunning firestorm which it could summon again as soon as the first one ended, leaving you running away from it, with no chance to attack it. This would happen in small areas with no real room for dodging, and it would even throw more than one of this enemy at you at a time.\n\nI wish i could give the game a "maybe" but i guess i'll let the 20-30 first hours speak and say that i recommend it.\n\nIf you really like these kinds of games or really loved the first one, then get this one, but i can do nothing but recommend you lower the difficulty near the end to make it less of a hassle.\nIf you haven't already played the first darksiders game, get that one instead and then consider getting this one.","April 9","true","85.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

It's a very fun ARPG, overall. Movement and combat are both fluid, the story is decent at worst, and maybe even good at best. Some specific points, in no particular order, follow:\n\n1. Platforming is easy. You cannot 'miss' jumps, because Death (whom you play) grabs onto handholds and bars automatically, as long as you jump in that general direction. The platforming elements are more of a simple 'puzzle' than an exercise in virtual agility. As somone who sucks at platformers, I loved this aspect.\n\n2. Puzzles are easy. Most of the time the solutions are obvious as long as you explore the surroundings. They're pretty inventive in certain ways, and each puzzle builds on elements used in the last one. As someone who sucks at puzzle games, I enjoyed them.\n\n3. My combos get interrupted when I'm hit. I can see enemies pulling back to strike, but I haven't discovered a method for blocking or interrupting them, no way to continue my combo without either getting hit or rolling away, and starting over. Perhaps there is a way I've not discovered yet, but this is a slight annoyance to me. Only a minor one though.\n\n4. Combat is very fluid and fun - comparisons to God of War come to mind (albeit without the long range of Kratos' chainblades, alas).\n\n5. The game runs smoothly, and loads quickly, with hardly any loading screens at all once you've loaded your savegame from the main menu.\n\n6. It's gorgeous!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/igyman/recommended/388410/","igyman","igyman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/igyman/","53 products in account","In the previous game you played as the Horseman War. This time around you play as Death, one of the remaining three riders of the Apocalypse and, parallel to the events of the first game, you will do your best to find a way to absolve War of his supposed crimes.\n\nDarksiders II offers similar gameplay as its predecessor at its core. However, this time around the designers and developers wanted to go bigger and a bit more complex. As a result, the game offers a much larger world, RPG-like character progression with skill trees and an RPG-like inventory system. Apart from Death's main mission, you will get a chance to solve a few sidequests as well and reap some additional rewards from them too.\n\nThe action is still as fun as it was in the first Darksiders and Death has some pretty nice moves himself. It's just a shame the spectacular gory finishers aren't as present in this game as they were in the first, but are tied to a specific weapon stat.\n\nEven though the composer is different, the music is still excellent, handled this time around by Jesper Kyd - a name people who played most of the Hitman games and the first two Assassin's Creed games might recognize.\n\nWhile Darksiders II is still a very good action adventure game, if I had to pick which of the two I enjoyed more, I would have to go with the first Darksiders. Most of the flaws that affect this choice aren't that big, but put together they result in a slightly worse impression for me.\n\nThis game does offer a larger world, but the switch from a ruined, post-apocalyptic Earth to four completely different worlds as the main setting also caused it to lose some of its charm. The bigger issue, in fact, is that looking at each of these four larger distinct worlds individually - their subsections are not as interesting, detailed and visually diverse as the various sections the first Darksiders offered in a single world. They also often feel as if they were made that big simply to justify the ability to ride your horse (you are a Horseman of the Apocalypse after all) and are rather empty as a result.\n\nSeveral sidequests are tied to (a tediously high number of) various collectibles and are not that interesting. On the other hand, for a game that tries to go down the RPG lane, it offers too few sidequests for such a large open world - this contributes to that feeling that the world is a bit empty. In general, I feel that trying to add more RPG elements and going with a bigger world at any cost didn't do Darksiders that many favors (as much as I love RPGs).\n\nThere are many other tiny nitpicks I could name, but I will skip them in favor of one big problem - bugs! The first Darksiders was quite polished (apart from the Steam achievement thing, which becomes a non-issue once you know about it). This game, however, has quite a few bugs. At random points after prolonged play the sound will stop working and will not go back to normal until you restart the game. Using the Steam overlay will cause the controls to stop responding at a random point and the game will act as if in a paused state, fixed only by going back to the main menu and reloading your save. The horseriding is a lot more clumsy and you may end up having to dismount to get unstuck. At rare occasions you may also end up stuck inside a wall, causing you to reload your save game.\nThese are just a few of the most annoying issues I encountered and I am really surprised they weren't addressed for the Deathinitive Edition.\n\nDespite the amount of text I spent talking about the flaws of this game, I still highly recommend it, just not as highly as the first Darksiders game. Still, if you can get past the bugs and some other potential flaws, you will have quite a bit of fun with Darksiders II.","May 14","true","60.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Story take you after the first Darksiders Where “War” is charged with his crimes by The Charred Council “Death” want to erase his brother’s crimes. This game is open world so there are side quests and the side quest and exploration are very rewarding giving you a good gear to beat the game. The puzzle in this game is better than the first Darksiders game, more complex puzzle that leave you thinking to get to the way needed. Fast travel is easier than the Darksiders 1. The collectibles are a LOT if you like you find collectibles in games this game is for you, what you collect have meaning to it not like other games. The game has very beautiful atmosphere and soundtracks they both work together making this game very amazing. put SweetFX will make the game more colorful. Combat is very fast you need a good eye to see what moves the enemies will make. Boss fight is the best thing I love in this game make you learn his move before you start attacking. The game took me 19 hours to finish it and I am rushing to finish the game, still I have a lot of side quest and additional story line in the main menu.","April 25","true","20.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

Performance is severely impacted but the core gameplay and action greatness is there.\nBy far one of the best games of the 2010's decade so far. I honestly see no point in fully reviewing Deathinitive as I will approach the original soon enough and the differences are so small that they don't deserve a second review. It's literally sharper textures and adding DLC.\n\nYes, you can carry your save game from the original, which is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome! Kuddos, Vigil and Nordic!\n\nIf you're wondering whether to grab this or the original from a key store, defo grab this if your PC isn't 2005 levels of weak, Deathinitive Edition of DS2 is one of the best Action RPG's made and surpasses the Dark Souls franchise, hardly will you feel ripped off by this unless you're a texture ♥♥♥♥♥ or not an ARPG fan (and even if you aren't, there are so many elements beyond the RPG formula that you may end loving the game anyway).","April 13","true","0.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Original. Version.\n\nIf you have both like me (I got Deathinitive Edition for free at some point before I found time to play the original), you probably want to play plain old Darksiders 2 and NOT this version. Why?\n\nFirst of all, the coding is BAD. The graphics are technically more detailed (though I felt the original has richer colours), but systems FAR better than mine still have serious issues with choppiness and screen tearing. If you have a super monster PC, it might run smooth, but for a game that's from 2012 you shouldn't need a monster of 2016.\n\nSecondly, the camera is insane. In Darksiders 2 it's reasonable - you can just move the camera like you'd expect. In Deathinitive Edition, you have to hold down a button while using the stick to move it. It does not move freely during combat and always snaps back to Death, making jumping very difficult, which you do a lot in this game.\n\nThirdly, a lot of oddities exist in the controls in general. For example, often you have to jump away from one object to another, but in this version it Auto-Leans away to begin with without pressing anything, so you often accidentally send yourself flying into oblivion instead of at the object you wish to go to.\n\nGreat game. You just probably want to stick to the original version and only run this one if you want the steam cards.\n\nEdit: I also just noticed you CAN'T buy the original version on steam now. That's horrifying. D: I'm so glad I had the original version to begin with, because Deathinitive Edition is -unplayable- for all the above reasons (seperately!) on my machine and while far from being a hardcore gaming rig I consider it a pretty powerful PC overall.","May 21","false","1.1"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

I encountered no frame drops, no crashing (except the start up thing for the first day), and no stuttering of any kind. Stay away from the negative reviews most of them are either sporting Pentium II's or butthurt kids who have everything in life served to them on a silver platter.\n\nThis is one of those times where I'm so damn happy that I disregarded the negative reviews for this game and went for it, I actually didn't have any of the DLC so I was happy to pay just 6 dollars for the remastered game and all of the DLC. One thing I was discouraged about was when I first bought Deathintive IT WAS CRASHING at the startup screen, every damn time, BUT it was actually PATCHED the VERY NEXT DAY. I got so excited to play darksiders 2 again. From all the negative reviews I read I was expecting a horrid looking, stuttering, ♥♥♥♥ port of a game, but in the first few minutes of the game riding up on despair to the icey mountain cave thing I watched the crows fly out at me through the snow in a wonderous 60fps world, and started drooling all over my controller. ( I always use an xbox controller with these type of games, and it also fixed the sensitivity bug) So yeah the game looked and ran amazing so far. I was holding my breath though cuz you know, all the negative stuff I read, it was going to crash soon or drop frames in an area full of tree's or something, but the further into the game I got more and more satisfied that i hadn't jumped on the "letshatenordic-cuztheygavemeadiscount train" I played this game non stop taking a couple breaks for sleep and whatnot, I had a great time. Hell I even waited until I finished the main story until I wrote this just to see if it did end up crashing from a game breaking bug or whatever reason. So now I'm left thinking that are these people tryna run this game on a system still using windows 98, sitting there not able to figure out for the life of them why the game they're playing isn't able to run on ultra at 60fps so they come to the conclusion that it must be the games fault (obviously) I mean my computers alright but its nothing special and I could play this start to finish without a single issue. Overall I would reccomend this to anyone, for sure, it was awesome back in the day and it's even more awesome now.

I AM PLAYING  ON MAX SETTINGS AND RESOLUTION WITH 60 FPS AND NO LAG OR STUTTERING.\n\nTo start off with, Darksiders 2 is quickly joining my list of favorite games of all time, which includes, Final Fantasy 7, Metroid Prime,and LOZ Link To The Past. Death is an awesome character and astonishingly badass with acrobatic moves, vicious attacks, and superb looking equipment. On top of all that, he gets to explore very creative and innovative worlds and dungeons that will lock you in and create one of the best atmosphere in all of gaming (In my Opinion) that will make an adult feel like a little kid again.\n\nThe gameplay is a blast (I played on apocalyptic difficulty). The enemy will force you to use all of your abilities which will require more than controller skills. Death's acrobatic dodge moves are very cool to watch and gets me psyched up every time I see them. His attacks are ferocious and exciting. There are tons of attack combos and moves to learn. Death will be equipping his scythe and a secondary weapon which can be a two handed hammer, fist weapon, Axe and more. The adversaries will use everything in their power to destroy Death but it will not be enough MWHAHAHA. The levels are filled with all kinds of obstacles. The puzzles can be a bit easy , but at the same time will make you think. Later in the game, it gets more exhilarating during boss fights. The bosses will make you think fast, quickly respond or they make you pay the price.\n\nThe environment and music makes this game even more fantastic. They scenes are beautiful and the wonderful music fits very well with the environment (I will be buying the soundtrack). The graphics remind me of much more mature World of Warcraft type style. Death will traverse all kinds of environments like water and fire styled dungeons. The dungeons are laid out in a Zelda type fashion, which suits my taste.\n\nThe story is pretty unique in its own way. You take the role of one of the four horseman trying to save his brother War. Without giving any spoilers away, I will just say this, Death may get side tracked with a much bigger problem.\n\nWith all that being said, this game is simply one of the best I have played. It has good mix from some of the best games ever made Prince of Persia, Zelda, God of War as well as staying unique in its own way.

How I wish I could love you.... Well, for anyone wondering if they should get this "Definitive" version of Darksiders 2, I'm afraid to tell you that you shouldn't. This game is a complete pile of buggy ♥♥♥♥. It has so much potential, but the bugs just kill off every part of that potential. The main bug I have issue with is not being able to climb around on vines correctly or easily. I got stuck about 15 minutes into the story on a vine climbing section. In that section, I would jump onto the vines, then Death would get stuck on them and jump right off to find out the meaning of his name. Another huge issue that I have is with the camera. This camera is just god awful for fighting. It never faces the right way, let alone targets the correct enemy. (Tested with and without Camera Auto Center) Then you have the oh so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ performance issues. These issues range from random pointless frame drops to complete freezing. Although, this could just be my PC, but I have a really beefy computer that never has any problems on any of the other 350+ games I own. To finalize this review up, I cannot recommend this in its current state. If the developers decide to fix the issues, then sure, throw some money at it, but as of right now, stay clear of this game.","November 6, 2015","false","0.3"," 15 of 27 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","15","27","0","0"

I'm disappointed it's actually more of a parkour Zelda, but that's nothing against the game. Hunting the chests is fun. The dungeons and puzzles are well designed so far. Scaling walls and mastering the climbing is rewarded.\nI'm wary about backtracking. I hate intended backtracking. The world design lead me straight to an interesting dungeon I had no business attempting. It turns out the boss in there is an optional bounty, intended for characters lv6-12. I was barely level 2. I barely knew I or enemies _had_ levels yet. Yup. It's by the first cool merchant in the open world, and entices you with a chest. Why? Just block it off with an NPC or the hooks that already made me skip several chests.\n\nCombat is fairly rewarding. Small groups of mooks are frequent and trivial, but that's expected. So far the boss fights have been neat and somewhat unique. As easy as it is to just mash light and heavy attack, encounters start to take some thought about dodge direction and how to utilize your active skills. So far most encounters are small and short. Maybe that will change. I'm not far.\n\nThis all said, it's fun and I probably will play it through. Secondary weapons seem to somewhat matter. Loot is cool. The demonic weapon upgrading is neat. The skill tree seems decent. I like you can respec, but it has a low-reasonable currency cost. Some old posts online imply you can actually have a 'build' by the end between the trees and gear. Not all solo ARPGs let you differentiate that much.\n\nGraphics\nI'm impressed. It looks and runs great. I like the art style a lot.\nThe first ice boss has a cool model and looked sharp. In game looks better than the video, more like the provided screenshots. I'm not experiencing the performance issues that generated most of the negative reviews. I assume they've been fixed. That said, I'm < 6hrs in as of this review.\n\nControls/Mechanics\nCombat is smooth.\nLock-on could have been a toggle instead of a hold, but it's fine.

I'm disappointed it's actually more of a parkour Zelda, but that's nothing against the game. Hunting the chests is fun. The dungeons and puzzles are well designed so far. Scaling walls and mastering the climbing is rewarded.\nI'm wary about backtracking. I hate intended backtracking. The world design lead me straight to an interesting dungeon I had no business attempting. It turns out the boss in there is an optional bounty, intended for characters lv6-12. I was barely level 2. I barely knew I or enemies _had_ levels yet. Yup. It's by the first cool merchant in the open world, and entices you with a chest. Why? Just block it off with an NPC or the hooks that already made me skip several chests.\n\nCombat is fairly rewarding. Small groups of mooks are frequent and trivial, but that's expected. So far the boss fights have been neat and somewhat unique. As easy as it is to just mash light and heavy attack, encounters start to take some thought about dodge direction and how to utilize your active skills. So far most encounters are small and short. Maybe that will change. I'm not far.\n\nThis all said, it's fun and I probably will play it through. Secondary weapons seem to somewhat matter. Loot is cool. The demonic weapon upgrading is neat. The skill tree seems decent. I like you can respec, but it has a low-reasonable currency cost. Some old posts online imply you can actually have a 'build' by the end between the trees and gear. Not all solo ARPGs let you differentiate that much.\n\nGraphics\nI'm impressed. It looks and runs great. I like the art style a lot.\nThe first ice boss has a cool model and looked sharp. In game looks better than the video, more like the provided screenshots. I'm not experiencing the performance issues that generated most of the negative reviews. I assume they've been fixed. That said, I'm < 6hrs in as of this review.\n\nControls/Mechanics\nCombat is smooth.\nLock-on could have been a toggle instead of a hold, but it's fine. I would have preferred trigger+button for assigned powers over bumber+button, but also fine.\nAs much as I love the look and idea of the horse, I wish they would have just given a sprint.

Get Your Death On!!\nOk im quoteing the old review at the bottom so i dont have to delete all that was said by all from my original review :) Im passing this to thumbs up now being Nordic is patching and fixing as much as they can with this one so its a safe bet to buy now. Most of my issues have been addressed and i only get a few skips here and there but hardly noticeable.Im sure they might even put out more patches maybe in time to improve performance.\n\nAs for the game like i said in my first DS2 Review and my first review for this one, this is a must play game !! This version is better being all the DLC and the Season Pass is here and integrated in the game for a seamless gaming experience. I dig the more RPG feel and scope in this one from DS1 . I think with the whole pricing issues, i think it just shows how many really love this game and series. I paid the 6 bucks and did not ask for a refund (nor will i)  even though i know Nordic is giving peeps keys if they show they have DS1,DS2 + Season Pass.\n\nSo now i will say hats off to Nordic for doing the right thing !! Now  hack and slash this one to the buy cart!!! BRING ON DARKSIDERS 3 + 4 :)  THE 4 HORSEMEN WILL RIDE AGAIN!!\n\n\nOriginally posted by Mr.Cypher:Buyer Beware For The Time Being  !!!\nOk i paid the 6 bucks for this so called upgrade (even thoe i own DS1 and DS2 and DS2 Season Pass and almost all the DLC for 2)  and now its stutters like crazy in some spots and fps drops like crazy no matter what setting i put it on. I will give them a benefit of the doubt a tad being im on Windows 10 Pro atm.So i know that can make games sometimes (but rarely) act funny.\n\nOk as for the game being i have the real version its a killer game and my first review was 100% positive and i think this game is a must have game, but in its current state or this version they need to fix it more.\n\nMy review will change if Nordic fixes the issues with the game\n\n** Just a note download the beta patch and it will clear up a few things but can still use some fixes and tweaks but it seems Nordic is trying to fix all the issues so A+ on that  **","November 7, 2015","true","3.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","35"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Argeon/recommended/388410/","Argeon","Argeon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Argeon/","190 products in account","About half-way done through the game, and so far, it's absolutely wonderful. At first I was skeptical about getting this game after hearing that the Deathinitive Edition absolutely cucked this game up, but at a 90% discount, hardly room for arguing, and I'm glad that I did, and here's why:\n\nWHAT'S GOOD ABOUT THIS GAME?    GAMEPLAY - Imagine Prince of Persia set in a relatively big world with exploration possible around every corner. Run on walls, solve little jump puzzles, fight tough mobs and sometimes groups of them, this plays almost exactly PoP. Familiar, yet with a personal twist.\nCONTROLS/CAMERA - When you're running on walls, the camera almost never ♥♥♥♥s you over, unlike PoP. Enough to stand on it's own, to be honest.\nSTORY - The story is neat. Although I did not play the first game, you're given plenty of context in the beginning of the game and don't feel completely lost in what's happening. It's essentially a revenge story and you wanting to stop the Corruption.\nBOSSES - Bosses - everywhere. All of them neatly designed and fun to find, fight, and beat. Unique and challenging, what more can you ask for?\nSECRETS - Holy ♥♥♥♥♥ secrets everywhere, secrets within secrets, SUPER secrets! Find gnoMad's stuff stashed everywhere is loads of fun!\nWHAT'S MEDIOCRE ABOUT THIS GAME?    VOICE ACTING/DIALOGUE - I found the dialogue and acting pretty cheesy. It fits the game, but I always roll my eyes when they start talking. Personal opinion though, so I won't count this against the game as a whole. Could be better, however.\nGRAPHICS - Graphics are a bit dated for a game this relatively modern. My frames were good at max, but the textures and jagged graphics are irritating, since the game without them would be gorgeous with the large open spaces and nature.\nDIFFICULTY - The hardest difficulty is pretty damn easy, and I'm usually not too good at these types of games when the difficulty is cranked up. What's up with that?\nWHAT'S BAD ABOUT THIS GAME?    UPGRADES - This should really be in the mediocre section, but for a game that wants to feel like an RPG, the skill tree is, for the most part, useless. I rarely use any of the upgrades (except for maybe 2), so they fell a little flat here.\nCOMBAT - Related to the upgrades, combat is largely the same. I constantly use M2 over M1 over my abilities. There is never really a use for any of the abilities inside combat.\nAll in all, you can see that the game is not as bad as people made it out initially. If you are a fan of Prince of Persia and the likes, you should definitely consider checking this game out. If not, then it's a DEATHINITIVE sale purchase. Enjoy getting lost in a magical world as the horseman of death.\n\n7.5/10","May 19","true","2.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/etpc1/recommended/388410/","etpc1","ETPC","http://steamcommunity.com/id/etpc1/","1341 products in account","let me preface this review by saying that i *really* did not like darksiders. i thought it was badly designed, the dungeons and bosses were medicore at best and infuriating at worst and the controls were a nightmare to navigate, especially when anything needed to be manually targeted. because of this, i avoided DS2 like the plague, thinking it would be more of the same.\n\nhowever, i was very pleasently surprised to find that darksiders 2 is far more tightly designed, open, and fun to play then it's predecessor. the RPG elements and loot systems are satisfying to engage with and tickles the part of the brain that likes to see the numbers go up. the dungeons are far better designed, with interesting puzzles and fun traversal sections that are clear, but just obfuscated enough to still be a puzzle. i never felt like the game was tricking me or like i was battling some badly implemented part of it like i was in DS1. even the voidwalker (see: portal gun) is far more interesting in DS2 then it was in DS1, where it felt gimmicky and tedious to use.\n\nhowever, there are still elements that are less then ideal in DS2. without spoiling story beats, there are sections where the game becomes akin to a third-person shooter with an over-the-shoulder camera, which feels clunky even when everything is working well. the controls and gameplay systems simply aren't setup for this kind of play style, and the parts where these gameplay elements surface are very much weak links in the strong chain that makes up most of the play time.\n\nthe story and art design can be very hit or miss for a lot of people, but i found the goofy mismash of Every Mythology Ever sprinkled with more then a little bit of comic book logic was pretty entertaining, and Death is a pretty entertaining character. Joe Mad's art may sometimes look like a self-replicating WoW character that succumbs to greeble, but i feel like it fits the big, dumb world of darksiders.\n\ni encountered a few crashing issues when alt-tabbing after the first world, which was strange, as well as a progression issue during the second DLC campaign in a side-dungeon, but nothing major. the touted graphical upgrade for the Deathinitive edition wasen't really noticable in a huge way, but it was very much welcome, though i wish the shadows were better, because they often fall prone to super bad striping in close-up character scenes. i played for 70 hours on a GTX 970 and a 3.4ghz i5 4670k with 8gb of ram at 1920x1200 and only had a few stutters when loading due to the game being installed on a mechnical external drive instead of my SSD\n\nin conclusion, i was super happy to play this game and was ashamed for avoiding it for so long. sadly, we might never get a DS3 because this was very much THQ's swan song, but Nordic Games (who now owns the rights to darksiders) says it might happen someday. next time, i'll keep my eye on it.","May 24","true","77.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/raptr-94ac5bcd/recommended/388410/","raptr-94ac5bcd","PandaFraHelvete","http://steamcommunity.com/id/raptr-94ac5bcd/","179 products in account","Darksiders 2 Deathinitive Edition is the continuation of the hidden gem Darksiders: Wrath of War, after THQ went bankrupt, Nordic Games bought the franchise and re-released the game with all DLC’s included and improved graphics, maybe necessary or not, the fact is that many, including myself, want this franchise to get a third game, for the sake of the story and lore. I originally had the normal version of Darksiders 2 so I got this new edition for free.\n\nStory\nOn this episode, we play as Death, War’s oldest brother, his mission is clear, to save his brother War of an unfair trial, blamed for the destruction of the Third Kingdom, because of this War has been imprisoned by the Charred Council. The storyline develops during the time Death’s brother is captive and whose soul is taken away as punishment. On this new adventure Death travels to many different worlds seeking the truth of what really happened on Earth and for this he meets new characters such as the Makers, who are old as creation itself, the crow father, keeper of secrets and many other demonic and angelic beings alike, some of them will stop you at any cost, some others will bargain to help you, whichever the case, Death’s path will be filled with powerful enemies, traps and many puzzles to solve, for in his journey he will have to face something more, Corruption has spread throughout the worlds hiding a more dangerous enemy well-known to the horseman, following the same formula as the original game, but this time with many more RPG elements and looting system, the search for the Well of Souls begins.\n\nGameplay\nThe game itself introduces a new system and mechanics, on the original game, the looting system did not exist, instead of that we collected artifacts and power ups that would help us gain more power. Now on DS2, a looting system has been created, a welcome addition if you ask me, as we struggle to get the perfect set of armor with many more capabilities and characteristics, we also have the addition of a whole new variety of weapons, scythes, hammers, axes, gauntlets and armblades, among others, which make the game much richer regarding content, we can also find possessed weapons, which can be upgraded by sacrificing other non-possessed weapons that will give them especial characteristics that will generate more damage, resistance or arcane abilities.\n\nThe worlds we travel through are bigger and filled with more puzzles that follow the same pattern as in the original DS, some of them are simply easier, and some others require especial tools to be solved with, which again will make you come and go from time to time to find unreachable chests or secrets that are far-off, all of this, enriched by the different worlds we will visit and enemies we will beat. Also, we count with a set of new skills and powers that will help us beat enemies easier and a level up system that will let us use much more powerful weapons and armor sets, always looking for a balance among them. Not great changes but still they are welcomed to get a better experience.\n\nGraphics\nWhen playing DS2 Deathinitive Edition I could not noticed the differences between the original version of 2012 and this new one, but as I got it for free, I thought I could give it a try expecting maybe the addition of the DLC’s in a different way (which I will address on another topic of this review) Nevertheless, the game still looks beautiful and follows the same comic-like patterns as the previous title, but this time it looks shinier and much more polished, and less rough around the edges, there are still some muddy textures here and there, but you forget about them instantly as you advanced on the storyline, considering the game has many different worlds, each of these worlds with diverse environments and vivid colors, from the more natural world of the Forge Lands to the gloomy and grim Kingdom of the Dead, the aesthetics of DS2 shows a variety in graphics, always highlighted by the details of every and unique world, beautiful art and design.\n\nMusic and Sound\nThe original Darksiders had a great soundtrack filled with more operatic and orchestral characteristics, here the music has changed, it was developed to what I believe a more atmospheric/ambient music, it really fits the game if we think about the world we visit, some of them require a different approach regarding the musical aesthetics, this makes travelling and dungeon/puzzle solving more appealing to the ear, it instantly hooks you to the mood of the mission, especially the Kingdom of the Dead, the music highlights the decadence of the kingdom and the gloomy atmosphere, the soundtrack has a lot of merit.\n\nAs for sound effects, they are equally good, you can feel the cracking of bones, the flesh being cut and scythes hacking and slashing the many enemies, demons still growl fearsome, angels still have that deep voice that make them feel righteous and fearless. As for the voice acting, I must say it is superb, on the occasion we have two famous actors doing voices, for Death we have Michael Wincott, who has done an outstanding job, it can’t be better, he fits the bill perfectly as for one the Makers, we have James Cosmo, broadly known for Game of Thrones and also the priest for one of the game’s trailers, just two actors to show how impressive the voice acting is here, they are believable and deliver powerful lines and flawless attitude for both characters. Just superb sounds and voices.\n\nThe Bad\nWhen I got this edition of the game and heard that all DLC’s would be part of it, I was expecting for them to be included as major side quests, for the normal version of DS2 had the DLC’s as extra content, but outside the main maps we visit, but I was disappointed when I saw the same content was added the same way as before, it would have been much better to have these extra missions as part of the main story, making it easier and more comfortable to travel at any time during main missions, that is not the case and to do these extra quests, you must leave the main game and look for this extra content, a great addition but flawed by not being added differently.\n\nAs for technical issues, the game suffers from crashes from time to time, in the middle of battles or just randomly, annoying at times, but it doesn’t happen that often, what affects the game more I would say is the bug where every time you go to your map and come back to the main mission, every single key stops working, the only solution we have is to restart the game or just go back to the menu option screen and be lucky not to have it anymore, sometimes this helps sometimes it doesn’t, an annoyance when you want to continue playing.\n\nAlso, there are sound issues, when playing some sound effects and some voices will stop working, or sometimes all of them at the same time, I noticed that this happens when there are many sound effects working at the same, this produces some other to start malfunctioning or don’t emit any sound at all, again, restarting the game will solve this problem for some time, not knowing of course it will happen again anytime soon. For a deathinitive edition this is not game breaking at all, but it weakens the definition they use for a game that has been re-released.\n\nConclusion\nAs stated on my DS review, the franchise has been compared to other similar games that dominate this genre and what not, but I insist that DS has the lore and world to make a greater franchise of its own, they have the tools, they have a rich world full of factions, characters to make of Darksiders 3 the game we have been waiting for since Nordic Games bought the series.","April 29","true","45.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

The combat will feel very basic, as most of it will be just smashing the attack, but as you get into the late game you will need to start thinking a little bit more, but nothing a few well timed dodge and pokes, then pressing the 'execute' key when you're prompt to win the battle.  There is a glaring issue with the game on PC as it will often crash at almost random times, generally after a specific input from the player.  I often found that firing my ranged weapon or closing a menu caused the game to freeze and required it to be forced to be closed. The game does auto save EXTREMELY frequently, enough that the crashes never caused me to have to replay more than 30 seconds of gameplay.","May 15","true","24.9"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I like the game a lot and if you like ARPG games you will too. The problem is that the Deathinitive Edition is unstable and buggy. The crashing is particularly accute during NG+ (new game plus is a mode where you get to play through the game a second time w/ all your gear and skills carried over from your first playthrough) due to a bug having to do w/ displaying critical hit damage (details here). The good news is that the auto-save feature of the game works well enough that when it crashes you don't lose a lot of progress, w/ one exception, the Cruciable. The Cruciable is a special quest where you fight wave after wave (up to 100 waves) of enemies. This can be difficult to complete due to the unstable nature of the game.\n\nI'm going to recommend buying this game but only if it's on sale for 75% or more because at those prices instability be damned it's a great buy. Just make sure you opt in to the beta so that you'll receive one game breaking fix and hopefully future updates that will address all the instability issues.\n\n[UPDATE] You can significantly reduce the probability of a crash by turning off the damage counter in the Options menu. But it will not stop all crashes, just the major cause.","December 17, 2015","true","498.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

But why so many puzzles? The premise is simply idiotic -- why would angels and demons devise puzzles anyway? Wooden stumps protruding of massive stone walls? Pressure plates -- in heaven? In Darksiders it was something you could live with, but this time it was wildly overplayed, and manages to make an otherwise fluent and pleasant gaming experience plainly obnoxious. A game about the Grim Reaper slaying things shouldn't feel like Portal or Talos Principle. Worst of all, it hates being alt-tabbed, so if you try looking for a guide or a youtube video when stuck (or simply because you don't want to waste hours of your life on that nonsense), you might lose a good bit of progress on account of it crashing.\n\nOverall, a potentially great title ruined by lame and misplaced puzzles.","April 24","false","132.5"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

And it makes me sad, to think that sequel of a good game, that i got hiped on after playing the first part of the story, wont be an experiance that i hoped for:[ at least not till these problems exist.

It includes all DLC content previously available and runs smooth on modern systems - even on my old (and hopefully soon to be replaced) AMD5750 graphics card, it runs just about the same as the original did, at a drastic increase in visual fidelity.\n\nOverall, I am very pleased.

Now I'll be honest in this review since I'm judging the GAME and not the business practices the devs have pulled here, although those should be addressed. Check the negative reviews if you want to understand why, but given time they will be irrelevant since this version officially replaces the base varsion of Darksiders II.\n\nI should also note my time spent is irrelevant because I have played and beaten both games multiple times back in my console days on the Xbox 360. Good? Good.\n\nPros: +An awesome story with an ever expanding universe full of well written and designed characters. It has humor, drama, suspense, horror, and even some well done sad moments.\n\n+A visually stunning world. While the texture quality may be hit or miss given the year it came out, the game has an absolutely gorgeous esthetic that fits right at home with some of the best stylized games such as Borderlands, and many of Blizzard's titles. The colors are breathtaking and the character designs are somthing out of a good comic book, like Todd McFarland's "Spawn" for instance.\n\n+A sweet soundtrack with excellent visual feedback all around for this game. Everything from the combat, to the voice acting, to the music ques oozes with ear warming sounds and makes the game feel even more satisfying to play. Audio is important to a title and this game passes with flying colors.\n\n+Fast paced, well done combat system with lots of combos and flashy moves to unlock, and tons of enemy variety with some seriously well done BOSS BATTLES that highlight just what a crazy universe this all takes place in.\n\n+Tons of content, especially with all the DLC now added into the game. You definently get your moneys worth with lots of varied locations, collectibles, quests, and a thoroughly long and satisfying main quest line. Don't let my P.C time fool you.\n\n+LOOOOOOOOOOT! If you are a fan of Diablo/Borderlands style loot drops with tons of weapons that game weird effects and make your guy look like a BAD-A$$ than you have come to the right game!\n\n+Interesting Zelda/Metroid style puzzle solving that isn't too complicated but makes you feel smart anyway for completing it. Tons of secrets to explore too so watch out for that chest marker on the map!\n\n+The Crucible. Normally I don't throw in things like this in a review as a bonus unless it's a seperate mode, but the WAVE BASED Crucible challenge is filled with great endgame content. It has awesome loot drops, excellent challenge, and some sweet extra boss battles outside of the main game.\n\n+ALL THE DLC!!!! I know I mentioned this when refering to the content for this game, but it begs mentioning again. One of the biggest issues with DSII used to be how expensive and how numerous all the DLC was for new players. It even involved things that SHOULD have been in the base purchase like some of the dungeons, and the Crucible.\n\nNo game is without it's flaws and Darksiders II is no exception.\n\nCon: -The port. Despite this being the "Deathinitive Edition" this game still suffers from poor optimisation, a bare bones options menu, and frequent framerate drops even when little is happening. I get it to work stable enough myself, but if you are expecting 1440p 144mghz gameplay with a framerate that never drops with your two 980Ti's then you will sadly be disappointed.\n\n-Sometimes very frustrating puzzles and confusing level design. This doesn't happen often, but I'll occasionally lost track of where I am going, what my objective is, and what I am even supposed to do for the puzzle. I used to stumble into areas I wasn't meant to and run around wondering what in the world my crow buddy is trying to tell me... speaking of which.\n\n-The crow is freaking useless. He goes all over the place, often in areas you just came from, and his pathfinding is the most confusing thing I have ever seen as quest markers go.\n\n-Occasionally cheap shot enemies.\n\n-Bad keyboard and mouse controls. I'm sure some people can get around this, but I SERIOUSLY reccommend a controller for this game.\n\n-Barely any graphical improvement. While the game's style more than makes up for it, the texture quality leaves a lot to be desired. Don't expect something like Witcher 3 from this. I can't stretch enough how good I think this game looks, but that opinion is entirely subjective and some people simly wont like the style and the texture quality wont help support that feeling.\n\n-While the controls are fine overall, sometimes the movement suffers from hectic combat and I cannot COUNT how many times Death has flipped RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE BIG GUY WITH A DRILL FOR AN ARM during his heavy attack and had half of his health nuked due to some dodgy... well, dodge mechanics.\n\n-Annoying and sometimes cryptic Quest markers. Quest markers are CRUCIAL in an RPG and the ones in this game desperately needed to relay information better. They often don't give you much information in their descriptions, and if it's designed for searching something it can be very frustrating due to the Zelda style level design. Sometimes they'll tell you to go somewhere and you'll be running around the quest marker hoping it'll move or give you a hint only for the objective to be under some underwater cave, in a secret room you have to find on your own. Combine this with Ash the Crow's crappy pathfinding and you will be left hunting the Darksiders Wiki for a lot of quests and puzzles.\n\n\nOverall, I love Darksiders II, and this franchise as a whole. Now with a third entry in the series announced I simply cannot wait for this franchise to continue to grow and expand this awesome universe. I give Darksiders II a 9/10. What holds it back is some annoying Questing, and subpar P.C performance. Many of the Base version's issues are solved with the DLC which boosts the score a point or two over the older version. It's worth every penny regardless and I am happy to reccommend this game even at full price. On a sale it's a complete steal.","November 7, 2015","true","16.2"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","12","23","0","2"

Love the customizable weapon/armor and skill tree to make the gameplay style more interesting. The game had many issues before, but Nordic Games has been resolving some of the known bugs and game performances. Most of the negative reviews here are people who people complaining how this should be a free upgrade for original DS2 and how buggy this game was at released. I was glad to spend $6 bucks for the upgrade (although it's limited time only for people who owns original DS2 & free for people who owns the DLCs too if you contact costumer support), but glad to support an HD treatment with a possiblity of the making Darksider 3.\n\nI deeply recommend this game because the developer's have been doing their best to please and keeping in touch with their costumer's issues, complaints and fixing all the known bugs/glitches.\n\n#RESPECT","November 10, 2015","true","20.4"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

Quite a few fetch quests but they fit will in the game and never felt like a chore.  Very nice array of boss monsters, each with their own tendancies.  Will take about 25-30 hours to complete the game.\n\nFighting mechanics are tight, or tight enough for me, but they need more controller options for the skills.  What I mean is that there are more skills available that the button mappings allow to use.  So, if you want to use a skill that is not mapped, you have to open a skill/item wheel and select it.  That takes away from the flow of the fight.\n\nWhile the developers taught rebalanced loot, I found that there was a scythe and gauntlet that I received about half-way through the game that I preferred and had better stats than any of the loot, even loot of a higher "level", that I found the rest of the way through the game.  There was a lot of throw-away loot.  Even possessed weapons didn't provide the stats necessary to take the place of my preferred weapons.\n\nOnly ran into a couple bugs - 1) An NPC got stuck in a wall.  Quit and came back in and he was free. 2) There was a cut scene where some of the dialogue and sound effects went missing.  Had to restart a few times before it straightened itself out.\n\nThe game also crashed one time, but only once and loaded right back up.\n\nAll in all, I really enjoy the Darksiders series, both I and II, and hope that the new owners of the franchise work towards a third game.\n","November 22, 2015","true","36.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The visual upgrades really do make the game look many times better than the original however it causes the game to have annoying levels of stuttering. I was dissapointed that they did not update some of the gameplay elements like:\n\n- I still hate that the camera is too close to the character, which is a problem when fighting groups of enemies\n- You can't use dodge in the middle of certain attack combos causing your character to get hit from pot shots while fighting groups\n- For a fighting game, I never got used to its "flow" of combat, its just weird and the timing feels off (except for the boss battles, these are fun in this game). It is frustrating that you can still get hit while dodging. The combat is generally not fun at all.\n\nThe reasons I am enjoying this game is because the platforming is fantastic, story and voice acting are top notch, the puzzles are challenging, and the environments and characters look amazing.\n\nI am recommending this game but I wont be surprised if you love and hate it at the same time like I do.","November 9, 2015","true","4.9"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","10","20","0","0"

Everything looks like it came right out of a comic.) The improved Graphics, textures, and lighting really help the game's comic book art style really stand out. (It's really great eye candy, and an example of a graphics update done right.)\n\nThe gameplay is unchanged from Darksiders 2, which is fine. Darksiders 2 is still a stand up when it comes to fantastic gameplay and level design.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vannex21/recommended/388410/","Vannex21","Vannex","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vannex21/","32 products in account","Hello guys, First I would like to start off by saying this is a very no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t review, so it may come off a bit blunt and left to some misunderstandings. I only played story mode and completed a lot of the sidequests and tried to get it fully completed, but you will read later why I didn't finish the game. I'm also writing this, because the other negative reviews are only downvoting for the sale, which is sad.\nMy first Impression\n\nBeautiful, The landscape and the rest of the enviroment was beautiful, it was very easy on the eyes and the deathinitive edition complimented it. The tutorial was very cut and dry about everything and even gave you a bird to help guide you wherever you needed to go and even in later parts of the game as well. The characters all had charm, like you could feel their emotions and believe them. They were very good at explaining their surroundings and potrayed a certain history of it that makes it feel it had depth. The button combo fights were very fun and you are able to summon spooky ghouls to help aid you and the weapons system is like Diablo 3...except less complex, but still interesting. This game looked promising at the start and I wanted to play it for a while.\n\nNow Here is the Cynical Review of it\n\nWhy does the world feel so empty? There is literally one area with nothing in it. It's so freaking huge, but there is nothing there. It only feels like I'm fighting 2 monster species in every area.  I swear there was only like 8 different monster species. Fighting the monsters at first are very satisfying, because you think, oh it's just the beginning, the fights aren't going to be too bad, but I better try to farm up and get better gear. Wrong. Dead wrong. Every monster you fight (Not including Bosses) feels exactly the same. A couple of autos and a super attack, that's it. Plus it makes the button combo fighting system feel very useless. Why do I need to use an AoE ability or a knockup? I could just easily press Square 3 times and kill them. It's not rewarding at all, AoE for example, You hardly every fight large groups of monsters in the game. There is no strategy or uniqeness.\n\nNext topic, Run speed or Area clears.\n\nI swear to god, I felt like I was in areas for half-hour to an hour, in some cases. All I would be doing is solving an easy puzzle, run back, fetch this, run around again, and so forth. I understand that the game environment is beautiful, If anything they did exceptionally well on,  it's how details that were put into like a statue or broken down stones, but for once, I wanted a Sprint system. Did I not mention how huge some of these dungeons are? I felt like I was running in Quicksand.\n\nQuests...\n\nStoryline aside, if you play this game, you will soon find out how redundant these quests get. There is even one of Main Quests that makes you do the same thing except different part of the story WTH? I feel like these tedious quests are just meant for you to run around and kill time. Paired with the uninsteresting monster fights it doesn't bode well at all.\nNow I think the point of these tedious quests and big areas was the puzzle solving. For the first few hours, it was sort of fun to do and made me feel like a champ, but they really limited the puzzles to where it just feels like another chore. If this was the first game you ever played, then this doesn't really partain to you, but if you played God Of War, The Legend of Zelda, Prince of Persia. You know that this is really just another copycat that only offers a half-written story.\n\nStoryline\nSo when you're first exposed to it after darksiders 1, It's interesting, because it's new and we like new things. Once you have acclimated to it, you start noticing things like why this, how, or this doesn't make sense. That's because there is only a partial bit of depth to get you where you're going. The plotline was Death needs to rescue his brother, but first he must fetch all this ♥♥♥♥ first, then he must solve these spooky puzzles, and after that you must defeat the ultimate evil.\n\nI recommend that if you played games like Zelda, God Of War, or Prince of Persia to stay the hell away from this game and just watch the 2 hours worth of cutscenes on youtube rather than 20 hours of tedious, redundant, and non-unique gameplay. You're not missing anything by doing so which is why I said earlier that it has little depth and still understand that you can just do so. I didn't finish the game after 75% completion and just watched the rest and still made sense.","November 30, 2015","false","11.0"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","11","23","0","0"

Is it actually fair to do such a thing to cripple a game in that way when especially when there was a fix, posted on the forums and then then an offical patch to fix the issue with the game.\n\nAlso there is the issue that Is beyond people's control at this point.  and that's the discount vs gettng the game for free if you owned all the existing content for DS2.  I can understand that it makes people mad, but then again, not a reason to give the game a bad review.\n\nSo with this out of the way... On with the review.\n\nWhat can I say about this updated an improved version of Darksiders 2.  Well one thing a lot of returning players will notice is the improved visual quality of the textures and the lighting.  and in a lot o cases, with the new lighting that has been added to the game it makes the game look complete different compared to the original.  Some might say that it is good, and some might say that it is bad.  to me, I am actually mixed about this,  seeing as how the new lighting can at times make it harder to pick out important parts of the terain that you need to move forward, such as ledges on walls etc.\n\nWhat you also get with this version of the game is all the previously released DLC and weapons but unlike the previous version they have been seamlessly intergrated in to the game.  No longer do you get a whole bunch of weapons and armor, but instead you get these weapons and armor as the game progresses.  Also the extra DLC missions are unlocked as you progress through the story.  Which if you ask me is a much better and more thought out idea.  seeing as how you can't do some of the DLC without having equipment from the main game.  this makes the DLC more enjoyable when you go in to it with the tools that you need.\n\nAll and all I would say that this version is an good update to the original which had it's share of issues, and I will admit they still do exist in this version.  But hopefully now that Nordic games is activly working on the IP and the game itself a lot of these issues can be addressed and the game will finally be turned in to the game that we've all wanted for so long.\n\nIn the end.  if you're new to the games, both Darksiders and Darksiders 2,  I'd pick them both up,   They both are great games and tell a great story with lots of action.  If you're returning to the series after putting Darksiders 2 down for awhile.  I don't think that you will be disappointed by the visual upgrades and changes made to the game.","November 6, 2015","true","17.6"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","10","21","0","0"

What can I say? This is a great series and Darksiders 2 needed some extra love.\n\nThe visuals look even more stunning compared to when I first played this game on the PS3. The Deathinitive Edition comes with all the DLC I had missed out on, better visuals, and a few tweaks here n' there to improve the mechanics of the game.\n\nThat said, there are a few issues with this game. Let's be honest, the game shouldn't be graphically demanding - so why does the game dip lower than 60 fps when I have a decent rig equipped with a GTX 980? I guess I'll cut the devs some slack hoping that they are continuing to optimize the game,\n\nThe DLC is hard to access. Entering the Tome, there's NOTHING. No DLC weapons, nor a crucible ticket. Maybe I have to progress further into the game, but it would've been great to be briefed on the new changes so that returning players can know how to get themselves accustomed.\n\nIs it worth playing again with this Deathinitive edition?

It runs flawlessly for me (GTX 980), which I'd expect given its age. Not sure how well it works on other hardware, so make sure to check other people's performance if you're concerned about your own setup being able to handle it.\n\nIt's a lot of fun, and looks as good as it's ever going to thanks to the polish it's received. Storyline might be confusing for some, but I'll try explain this as easily as I can while remaining conscious on this much Morphine: Nephilim are cross-dressers who like to get jiggy with dead bodies... Wait, no, wrong creeps, I was thinking of Aunt Robert - they were combinations of Angels and Demons. Because why not, right?  There were lots of them. They killed everything that moved.\n\nThe powers-that-be didn't like this and struck a deal with 4 such Neph: We'll give you supreme power if you f*** up anyone whose race starts with 'N' and ends with 'ephilim'. A few hours later, Death (who was known as Horace the Horrific at that point because of his Horrific taste in Halloween masks) cottoned on to what they meant, and he and his two Brothers, as well as his sister (called Fury, because... well, you know, 3000 years of PMS will do that to you, not to mention having 3 brothers who always leave the toilet seat up) decided to slaughter them all.\n\nStuff happened, more stuff happened after that, and then someone went and broke some Seals (the other Seals were so upset by this they all went Clubbing after the funeral)  which indicated the Apocalypse was meant to begin.\n\nExcept it wasn't, but that didn't stop War (known in some circles as 'Stoney Tony') from f***ing up big time and starting the Apocalypse accidentally himself. Oops. I told him to lay off the Pixie Dust, but would he listen? Would he f***.\n\nWith Humanity wiped out, Horace was all, "Goddammit Tony I can't take you anywhere AND PUT THAT BLUNT OUT FOR KANYE'S SAKE", so he then goes to try and reverse this catastrophic set of events, and prove Stoney's innocence.\n\nWell, that and so he could get all stabby-slicey with the local demon populace.\n\nAnyway, long story short, this game rocks, it looks good, it plays well now that it's fixed (devs fixed a catastrophic crash bug in 24 hours - hear that Rocksteady?) and the only complaints I know of right now are the fact that it doesn't run perfectly for everyone.

Only about an hour in but since I've beaten the game before on console and most of you reading this already know its a solid game with pretty solid mechanics then the only thing on trial here is the remake itself. Normally I just make dumb ♥♥♥ reviews but this game is littered with them so I'll be serious this go around. The game looks pretty good but I wouldnt say its light years beyond the original. There is some newer areas added in and enemies are slightly remodeled. Death is still a smart ♥♥♥ SOB. And the game is still fun. The game runs good but I wouldnt say butter smooth and yes, it does lag a bit every once in a while. Will I recommend it? Sure. Would I recommend it if you already own it and have beaten the original? No.  Not unless you got it for free or for dirt cheap like I did.

Patches have improved performance, which was garbage on release, however this still suffers from micro stuttering which requires a separate fix.\n\nUnfortunately, the game loses a lot of its color and flashy effects which were some of the things that made the original game special. Whether you get this version or the original is up to you, if you want sharper textures and realism, this is your version, however it also washes out the high contrast lighting and colors from the original. This video shows a comparison between the old pc release, and the ps4 version of this one, and the PS4 version doesn't have very many differences to this one - and it's easy to see what I'm talking about: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84LmGBqqPLs\n\nIt's up to you to decide which version you prefer, however I much prefer the look of the original version over this one.

However I refuse to factor the cost in my opinion of the game so if you can afford it...Read on...otherwise this review will serve you no purpose. All this being said, I want to support Nordic Gaming because I personally want another Darksiders game and really don't wish to see this project shut down.\n\nIn terms of the graphical updates such as the lighting and visuals, I'm impressed compared to what the older game was. Game looks sharp and crisp however by no means is it Division quality. But again thats a different game and based on what they had to work with this game looks really good. I also am enjoying the Deathinitive difficulty not being carried by possessed weapons throughout the entire game as they just ♥♥♥♥ out of chests in the older game. Either that or i'm just incredibly unlucky but I doubt that. Bosses actually feel like bosses and even certain trash mobs are incredibly difficult unless your reaction is on point.\n\nNow lets talk about all the bad reviews (which were all posted day 1) about all the bugs and crashes and nonsense. Doesn't exist at all, atleast for me. There was even an issue with the aiming (last week) where it was maxed out on sensitivity making it near impossible to aim. Also gone now. It appears to me that Nordic Gaming is hearing our crys and is patching things together in a quick manner and with that being said, I feel I could trust them bringing justice to a new Darksiders title. I hope they keep up the good work and I'm interested to see what more they can do down the road.","November 11, 2015","true","11.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

(also, 5/10 things are shiny. That's an added plus in my book.)\n- Adds a new difficulty, DEATHinitive. This is good for players like myself that plan on perfecting this game.\n- For people that already own Darksiders 2, it's currently 12 dollars (was 6 up until 12:00 11/12/15). It's not much compared to it's soon to be $30 price tag.\n- Despite its very rocky day one launch, Nordic seems very keen on listening to the Community and fixing any issues as soon as they can.\n-The DEATHinitive Edition includes all the DLC (minus the soundtrack) already installed. If you didn't have all the DLC in the original, this is very much a plus. It'll make your new playthrough far more enjoyable and fresh.\n-This version of Darksiders 2 adds Steam Cards. I don't think I need to explain why this is a good thing. (Gimme dat badge already...)\n\n\nCons (as of 4:43 pm 11/12/15) :\n\n- As stated previous, had a very rocky day one launch. This means a handful of issues.\n- As of 11/12/15, the DEATHinitive Edition isn't very optimized. Will change once game is properly optimized.\n- Some hit detection issues against destructible items (i.e. boxes, ceramic vases, etc.), especially when framerate is fairly low due to sketchy optimization.\n\n\nNow, I feel I should make this known, as it seems most of the community doesn't know. THQ, the original publisher of the Darksiders franchise, went out of business around 2013. That much a good 90% of us know, as well as the fact that the Darksiders franchise was created by Vigil Games, which also went out of business in 2013. Nordic Games bought the rights to most of the THQ IP's, including Darksiders. The new company that was put in charge of creating Darksiders 2: DEATHinitive Edition goes by the name of Gunfire Games, which as it turns out holds a rather large amount of Vigil Games employees. Essentially, it's the same people working on the upcoming Darksiders 3 that worked on the previous titles. The 6/12/30 dollar price tag is by no means a bad PR move, nor is it a robbery of the community. If it were some random company that had never even heard of the name "Darksiders", then it would, and I would fear for Darksiders 3.\n\nGive this game some time people, Nordic is working on fixing it.\n\nUpdate: I was incorrect. There are no new quests in the DEATHinitive Edition.","November 12, 2015","true","8.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Nordic Games, who purchased the IP from the now defunct THQ, may have chose this name ironically, making fun of the plethora of remasters that have graced this generation, or maybe they actually thought it was a good name making this more of a tragedy than a comedy. I’ll be honest, what you’ll get out of the Deathfinitive is largely dependent on whether or not you’ve played Darksiders 2 before. The remastering job done by Gunfire Games is commendable, however, they touched up a game that arguably didn’t need touching up. The great setting, over-the-top story, and intuitive combat are still present however, and if this is your first experience playing Darksiders 2 this is currently the best version to pick up.\n\nDarksiders 2 has a distinct visual aesthetic that is the result of the original developers, Vigil Games, hiring a comic book artist as the art director. This produced a larger-than-life dark fantasy theme that gives the characters, world, and combat a very unique look. Because of the stylized graphics Darksiders and Darksiders 2 have aged very well; if the art style had been more realistic and grounded this could be a different story, however, the remaster job here almost goes to waste as a result. I have to be honest, I had to do a direct comparison in order to see a difference between the two. While the lighting has certainly been enhanced and textures are sharper, the overall aesthetic of the game is still exactly the same, enhanced by the visual upgrade, but by no means creating a new experience. In short, the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 versions of this game still looks fantastic and getting the Deathfinitive Edition for just the graphical upgrade may not be the best idea.\n\nBut maybe you haven’t played Darksiders 2 and you are looking to give it shot? That’s great because, in my opinion, this one of the best original franchises to come out of last generation and Darksiders 2 is the better of the two games. The series is famous for its derivative nature, taking elements from other franchises then combining them and twisting them into something unique and often time successful. The combat is typical combo-driven hack and slash fare similar to God of War or Devil May Cry. You do upgrade your abilities through an RPG mechanic that has you putting points into either offensive or defensive abilities depending on your play style. There is also a loot system that feels half-baked and unnecessary; it really just becomes a game of making sure you have the best armor or weapons equipped rather than strategically picking the right item for the right situation and it’s probably the only real issue I have with the game. The previous game had you focusing more on upgrading existing equipment rather than constantly picking up new items that drop from fallen enemies and chests. The world is structured similarly to a Legend of Zelda game where you have a large hub world with smaller dungeon areas branching off from it. In order access new areas you must acquire new gear and it always feels like you are progressing. All in all the gameplay loop is satisfying and keeps you entertained for the 20 or so hours it takes to complete the game. Combine that with a fairly standard yet entertaining dark fantasy story, memorable and well voiced characters, and an appropriately epic soundtrack and you have the making of a terrifically entertaining experience that is well worth your time.\n\nIt is difficult to review a remaster especially one for a game that only came out 3 years ago. The work that went into remastering this game is commendable, but ultimately wasted when you directly compare it to the previous versions. And while it is nice to get a Darksiders game on the current gen consoles, the experience feels some what incomplete without the first game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jamil_nyc/recommended/388410/","jamil_nyc","AmazingFantasy15","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jamil_nyc/","90 products in account","Note: Review for original DS2 plus my take on Deathinitive at the end.\n\nDarksiders II will go down as one of my favorite games of all time.\n\nI really enjoyed DS1 and was eager to see what DS2 had in store, although I was a bit nervous at first about playing as Death instead of War. I got over it.\n\nFirst, DS2 compared to DS1:\nMuch larger world with more characters to interact with.\nTons of new weapons, armor and powers to mix and match to your play style. Feels almost like an MMO!\nUse your horse from the get-go.\nWhere War is heavy and powerful, Death is nimble and lithe.\nMinor notes: There's no double jump or underwater attacking.\nSecond, DS2 as its own game:\nPros:\nNice graphics, architecture and atmosphere.\nSoundtrack is pretty cool.\nVery fluid and intuitive gameplay. There are tons of combos or buy/learn and lots of weapons to try out. Whether your style is magic, heavy hitting or quick attacks, there are weapons and powers for everyone.\nIt's got a bit more parkour than the last one, which is fun. If you've played Prince of Persia (2008) it will seem really familiar.\nStory is lengthy, but a little convoluted at times. The DLC/bonus campaigns are a nice touch.\nBoss fights are good and I liked the puzzles.\nLots of sidequests.\nCons:\nSome missions become a little too "fetchy." I need to talk to person A. Person A won't talk to me until I get items X, Y and Z. I get X until I collect α, β and γ. You get the idea.\nSometimes I forget why I'm doing what I'm doing.\nSpoiler:  You never interact with War, although it is your mission to save him.\nTowards the end of the game, it got a little buggy: More on that later.\nGore/violence is not that much considering it's "M" rating. I was expecting more severed limbs and guts.\nDeathinitive Edition:\n\nI was in a weird position. I was actually about halfway done with the standard edition of the game when the Deathinitive came out, promising better game play and stuff. At first, word on the street was that you couldn't copy over your save file. So I said, it's probably better if I finish the original first. So here's what happened. I came across a crippling bug: I was unable to open a void walker portal towards the very end of the game. It was supposed to just open, but wasn't responding to me. I saw online that one other guy had this problem and in the end gave up on the game. I was afraid I'd have to do the same. I restarted the application, and it was stuck on the load screen. I was so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ because I couldn't finish this amazing game, due to a stupid bug. Eventually after the Kubler-Ross 5 stages of grief, I accepted it and realized this was probably the time to start playing the Deathinitive Edition. And that's when things got crazy.\n\nI downloaded Deathinitive and saw that it had a save slot already for the exact location that I was in in the Standard Edition when the bug hit. I loaded it and it worked! I was able to finish the game I started on the Standard Edition and am now current in New Game+ in the Deathinitive. Overall, the graphics so-called improved graphics in this edition are not all that impressive. In most cases I don't notice a visual difference. However, my PC goes into maximum overdrive like I'm playing Arkham Knight on the highest settings and becomes very loud. I don't think the graphics justify the extra heat.\n\nSo bottom line: This is a really great game and I hope everyone can enjoy the Darksiders franchise. I am really excited about the possibility of a DS3!","January 1","true","8.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It has a nice and entertaining stoty (A long one) which I enjoy in games. A lot of games nowadays just care about Multiplayer experience but this kind of games are worth it.\nI've found some issues in the game, minor but they're there.\n\n1- Still suffering of frame drops. I have 16GB RAM, AMD FX-6300 and NVIDIA 750Ti (2GB) and the game asks for 512MB so, that means the game isn't really optimized for high end graphic cards (A problem that a lot of old games have) but they're in some areas, like big places but, it is ok\n2-Its controls are designed for Xbox/PS so, using a keyboard will be a bit of a struggle. I'm used to it because I played Darksiders 1 in PC too but if you haven't, make sure you spend some time getting used to them\n3- Another problem with controls, while in the tutorial, you get some control pop-ups (Like press W/A/S/D to move) but, I noticed that there's a mistake (At least it happened to me). The mistake I found was "Press CAPS to jump off the ledge" but it is actually SHIFT+SPACE.\n\nThat's basically all the problems I've encountered. I know I have less than 1 hour gameplay but I finished Darksiders 2 before it became Deathinitive edition and I actually have both in my steam library. If you can, buy the Darksiders Franchise Pack 2015. I highly recommend that you play Darksiders 1 before playing Darksiders 2 as it is important to understand the story of the game itself. If you find any grammar mistakes in there I'm sorry, not a native english speaker lol.","November 18, 2015","true","9.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you delete the option files in two places it stops the crashes as it seems having shadows set to anything other than low will just crash the game.\n\nI've been playing for a few hours now and love the update. It just looks far and away much better than the first release. While some complained of the lack of color and the darker lighting, I like it quite a bit. Everything feels less washed out than it did. Plus the up-res in textures as well as the updates in some just really helps make this game look great. Along with of course the 1080p, which I got working though I know some did not.\n\nWeapons and the like do seem to be a bit more well rounded. I haven't come across the DLC weapons though I believe they are scattered throughout the game now instead of just getting them at the beginning.\n\nOverall I'm having a fun time playing through the game yet again as it's been awile. Hopefully I won't come across anymore bugs!\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n*First Review*\n\nI was incredibly excited to hear that I would be receiving this game for free! I love the Darksiders Franchise and they are my favorite games overall. Unfortunately however, I cannot even load a new game up before it just crashes. Consistently crashes as well no matter what. I do have an Xbox controller hooked up so I will see if unplugging it helps.\n\nI really want to play this game and give it an awesome review!\n\n*Edit - Unfortunately unplugging the controller does nothing. It crashes after I start a new game and the logo comes up. Right as the first tip comes up for dodge rolling, it crashes.*","November 5, 2015","true","29.9"," 29 of 60 people (48%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","48","29","60","7","8"

The combat system is so dynamic and included more rpg elements, you have two different trees of skills and different equipment for death, the story is sublime and never get repetitive.\n\nNow about this edition you probably read other reviews about complains of the free upgrade for the franchise pack users (blah..blahh) for me was free XD. The game really look renew and with a new face (new textures, effects and  a lot of more fun) i have not experienced any troubles in the performance, if you enjoy the first DS2 you must have this edition.

One of the nice features is that if you already played Darksiders your save data transfers over just by playing it. However NOT your achievements. So if you got every single achievement from Original Darksiders 2 well... too bad. If you haven't played Darksiders 2 now is a good time to do so.

I was neither an early adopter nor had spent a great deal of money on the game beforehand even for the core version, so the update's price doesn't really bother me from a personal stance, though I can understand both early adopters' laments and the issues Nordic is having to deal with considering the license transfer from THQ for the property.\n\nSo! Is it worth it?\n\nAs a DLC update, yes, though I have yet to see any of this DLC in the game (I've got closer to 10 hours in the game including time in the original DS2 as I was in the middle of my first playthrough when I saw the announcement for this.) As for everything else, the changes are either quite small or I simply haven't come across them in a major way yet. SOme models seem slightly tweaked, but nothing extreme, and overall anyone coming into this expecting a world of difference will be disappointed. DS2 is a great game, with solid controls, a beautiful world, and some of the absolute most amazing music I've ever heard, but it is by no means a groundbreaking title, serving as a mixed-bag of Prince of Persia, God of War, and Zelda and mixing the three into a tasty combination that works well but fails to do any one thing as well as its inspirations. The Deathinitive Edition is the same game but with more content, so don't expect it to change your mind if you weren't impressed by the regular version.","November 7, 2015","true","5.0"," 11 of 24 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","11","24","0","0"

They new they were getting to into a pretty picky fanbase, and they're trying their best.\n\nNow, onto the review:\n\nThe game is the same as Darksiders 2. If you were expecting Darksiders 3, I'm sorry, but this isn't it.\n\nThere has been some changes here and there, graphical changes, UI tweaks, texture rises, as in, the textures don't look like absolute ♥♥♥♥ now, general tweaks to enhance what THQ left us with. Now, are they bad, or good? Well, they're kinda both.\n\nOn my end, the V-sync is almost completely broken, as it was in the original. AA is also broken, as far as I can tell. I didn't pay too close of attention, though. I alt+tabbed once and the game crashed. Got me a little pissy, but I remembered this is an active thing, and fixes are coming/will come. So we're going to have wait and see.\n\nNordic Game hesitated on doing things with this because they know how we, the fan-base, can get if not done properly. I have been a loyal fan of the Darksiders series since day one. Loved War's story, and I love Death's story. I love the gameplay and art style of both, these games were a dream come true in my own opinion. The develops though, ehhh...\n\nDarksiders 2 was broken to begin with, even without this new Dethinitive edition. And Nordic Games are trying to remedy that. They're doing their best, and at the moment, they're doing an okay job at that.\n\nPeople need to learn to be a bit more patient, and wait for more fixes. You people gotta realize this came out in 2012, and they're just restarting updating it. It's gonna take some time before they get it into a stable condition, all along adding slight changes and tweaks to it.\n\nAll in all, do I recommend this? YES. While it's on sale. If you're reading this when it's not on sale, wait until they apply more fixes to it, then buy it. If they already have applies fixes, and it already is in stable condition, then I can without a doubt recommend this to you at full price.\n\nYou're doing a fine job, Nordic Games. Just keep it up, and everything will go smoothly.

I also enjoyed the DLC's of Darksiders 2. When I heard that there is a new HD Edition I knew I want to play it. So far so good there where no problems at first. My last savegame was in one of the DLC, "The Abyssal Forge". I had to kill the Boss and the last time I played, I was simply to lazy. So after i finished Deaths work I wanted to play the stroyline again, because i had a game + started. And here comes the kicker if I play the "Deathinitive Edition" I am not able to switch between the orginial game and the DLC's anymore. So basically my game is stuck now at the abyssal forge wich is pretty boring after you finished it. So i tried to load my game at the normal Darksiders 2 Edition, but once after you saved in Deathinitive you can't load your game anymore in the normal edition. I really hope that I'm the onlyone with this problem and i further hope, that this bug will be fixed soon.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WickedJeromy/recommended/388410/","WickedJeromy","Wicked Jeromy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WickedJeromy/","434 products in account","I received this version for free because I own the original version with all the DLC. This game is the same as Darksiders 2 with all the DLC except it has an HD make over and it also has some bug fixes and loot tweaks. I see a lot of reviews giving this game a bad rating simply because they didn't receive this version completely free which is just lame in my opinion. Depending on which version of Darksiders 2 you own you either got a free copy or a discount of up to 80% off.\n\nNow as far as the game goes it's a very fun game with some issues. My biggest issue is with the camera. The camera doesn't always go where it should be. This games uses dashes and rolling manuvers instead of a blocking system, so sometimes when you roll away from an enemy it takes a second for the camera to catch up (you can move the camera manually). The games HD make over looks and runs nice on my I5 laptop with my 6 gigs of ram and 1 gig dedicated video card.\n\nThe gameplay is borrowed from some very popular games.In this sequel you play as War's brother Death. Most of the fighting and combo mechanics are borrowed heavily from God of War. The movement and wall systems are borrowed from Assassin's Creed or Prince of Persia. As Death you can run along walls grab pillars jumping from rock to rock. the games dungeons and puzzles are clearly Zelda inspired. I see alot of people say this is a zelda clone. I feel it's more like God of War than Zelda. If you are looking for a Zelda like game I suggest Oceanhorn it's a full zelda tribute (as close as you can get to a Zelda game on PC).\n\nAll in all this a great game with Bosses, Gear, Skills, and Weapon upgrades. If you don't own Darksiders 2 and all the DLC this is the version to buy. This is a great game that failed to fix some minor problems with game play and camera issues, but doesn't take away from the game as a whole. Bottom line if you like God of War, Assassin's Creed, & Zelda this is a game for you.\n\n7.5 / 10","November 6, 2015","true","0.8"," 11 of 27 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","11","27","0","0"

The combat consists of three buttons, attack 1, attack 2, and dodge. Once you learn to unlock your camera and dodge roll behind an opponent as he's winding up an attack, the game may as well give you the end credits. That is of course after you learn the abysmal consol port controls, and you will have to learn them. The game treats you like a baby with it's graphical options, the most advanced option avalable is Vsync on/off. Suffers from crashing, severe hitching, low-poly dated graphics, combat so patheticly shallow super smash brothers rip offs have less ♥♥♥♥-takeing simplicity, aids and ebola.\n\nThe story isnt entertaining, none of the characters likable, the game's progression boils down to 9 tedious fetch quests, the platforming is out of place and mediocre at best even with a third party perspective, using any weapon that requires use of the lock on is unusable with mouse and keyboard, as it will change your mouse from looking around, to a mouse cursor on a static screen as you're still moving around being attacked, prompted to aim and shoot by clicking on them without even being able to turn.\n\nDO NOT buy this game. Do not buy any darksiders games. Even if you take away all the technical issues, give it visuals better than a university student's exam result and update proper PC controls, the experiance would still be as bland as eating your own snot.","November 7, 2015","false","0.3"," 6 of 17 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","6","17","0","1"

The higher resolution textures are noticiable and crisp, and the lighting is dramatically improved. The review bombing for it not being a free upgrade fro everyone is a bit frustrating, as it in no way reflects the game itself. C'mon, $6 for an improved version of the game is NOT bad. ie, there are enough changes and work into the game that the $6 is well worth it.

Aim Mode\nThe biggest problem I encountered was Aim Mode. In the first dungeon, the Cauldron, you have to throw shadow bombs at switches in order to progress, which means going into Aim Mode. For some reason the sensitivity in Aim Mode is exponentially higher then when normally moving the camera, so moving the mouse like you normally would has the camera doing 1080 turns. After looking online and messing with settings extensively, I settled with having the aim sensitivity around a quarter of the bar and switching my mouse's DPI to 400 and moving extremely carefully whenever I had to use Aim Mode. Hopefully there will be a fix for this.\n\n2. Controls/Key Bindings (My god this game needs a manual)\nSome of the games key placement are uncomfortable, like dodge being on alt.\nI personally started using my thumb on alt and got used to it, but others may find simply re-binding the keys to be easier. However, re-binding can be a hassle in itself. Due to the fact that you can not bind a key to another if an action is already bound to it, simply switching between two keys means binding the first to an unbound key, binding the second to the first, and then binding the first to the second. There's also the fact that there are multiple keys that are already bound against your knowledge, so finding an unbound key in the first place becomes more difficult.\n\n3. Actions/Executions\nThe game doesn't explain about several mechanics in the game, some of them literally being key to move on.\nInteracting with a person/object seems elementary, yes? But other then an icon popping up and telling me I could do an action, I wasn't told that "E" was interact. In fact I had to look online for this answer, and despite thinking I was an idiot for doing so, saw several forum posts of people asking this same question.\nSimilar to this is executions. Executions are animated instant kill strikes that restore all your gauges (health, wrath, reaper) and have increased chances to drop gear. This isn't a problem on console since the button you have to press appears over the enemy when you can execute it, but on PC you simply see a red circle and wonder "What the hell does that mean?", again not being told that the interact key solves the question.\n\n4. Frames\nThere have been other reviews stating the game stutters, tears, and drops frames. The only thing that I saw was frames skipping from turning on default sensitivity due to the speed. Putting on V-Sync and lowering the sensitivity for Aim Mode seemed to get rid of this.\n\nIt should also be noted that upon entering the tutorial dungeon, the Crowfather's palace, my display drivers crashed. Everything worked fine when I reloaded the game and I was able to continue onward.\n\nOverall I highly recommend you wait till patches come out and fix these and any other problems that may be prevalent in this game.\n\nP.S. On a side note, I personally love the Darksiders series and can't wait for further entries. Hopefully they'll be more PC friendly in the future.\n\nHere's a link to my pc specs if you were wondering: http://pcpartpicker.com/p/KggcXL","November 9, 2015","false","26.0"," 11 of 28 people (39%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","39","11","28","7","0"

It was perfectly stable and well optimised, the graphics quality wasn't anything to complain ablout, and it had something resembling a plot. This ""reworked"" version has increased the texture quality, at the expense of everything else that actually matters. Changing anything in the settings crashes the game, the camera sensitivity is way too high, even on the lowest setting, making guns useless, and the ""improved graphic rendering engine"" results in pathetic frame rates, especially with vsync.\n\nHonestly, if you want to play darksiders II, get the original.","November 7, 2015","false","8.0"," 6 of 18 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","6","18","0","0"

For only $6 i decided to try it, never beat the 2nd one and was interested in it on the Xbox One so PC would be even better!\n\nGame loaded fine first try, even transfered my saved data from the orginal pc release.  I played around a bit, game played super smooth and the cleaned up textures are noticable but not jaw dropping.  So then I went into the graphics settings (which are still bare bones) and noticed everything was maxed, even shadows.  I decided to lower the shadows one notch, as recommend by are friends on Steam, just to be safe.  The diffrence in quality is barely noticeable.  So far so good!\n\nGame plays at a solid 60 fps at 1440p with no problems at all. Not a single crash. Very happy with this, and can wait for the stupid shadow bug to be fixed. Definitely the best way to play this game, and if u haven't played this game before it's worth a look.  Zelda meets God of War, with a biblical story of Armaggedon and the four horsemen!  The art style is great, and the better textures and lighting make this the best way to play.\n\nDon't be put off by all the bad reviews, which are the main reason for this review, because this game is absolutely worth a purchase!

This version is now equal in stability and performance to the original release, and has slightly better graphics.\n\n**Original Review**\nWas a big fan of Darksiders and Darksiders 2.  I've played Darksiders all the way through maybe four or five times, and have played through Darksiders 2 three times prior to this remastered version.\n\nGame immediately crashes upon starting.  Have to reset settings and lower shadow quality.  Why I need to not max out shadow quality on this graphical remastering makes no sense and should never have been launched with this issue.  Started a new game and played through to the start of the cauldron.  The camera feels "shakier".  I had just started a new game on the original release a week ago, and re-launched it at the same starting area and it doesn't feel "shaky".\n\nI had a cutscene that I couldn't use space to skip dialogue in.  Was the first time I tried, so I thought maybe the button was changed.  I pushed a bunch of buttons on the keyboard and mouse to no avail.  When the cutscene finished, I spent the next ten minutes watching Death roll around and swinging as every queued up button press was executed post cutscene.  After ten minutes I gave up and restarted the game.\n\nNot happy with having to buy this for $6 because I don't own a combo pack.  Overall after an hour or so of play I don't really see this as being worth it for someone who already has Darksiders 2.  The graphical improvements are OK, but not worth spending money on.  The only reason I am giving this game a thumbs up is that people buying this may help with getting a Darksiders 3 created, and that's a worthy goal.","November 5, 2015","true","32.4"," 11 of 29 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","11","29","0","0"

They also implemented a nice feature to let you reset the game settings at launch if you need to just in case anyone runs into a similar problem where a game setting caused a problem for them.  Buy this game.  Seriously.  If you haven't played it, you probably ought to.  It's woefully underrated.\n\n\n\nSupposedly there are bugs.  I'm confident the devs will fix the issues that people are having  (e.g. with the shadow setting right now -- I haven't run into any problems yet with shadows on medium).   I think that, in general, this edition looks significantly better than the original release, although there's a moment early on in the game where I think the lighting may have given an ever so slightly more epic feel in the original release.\n\nThe important thing is that if this game looks like it might be your thing, it probably is and the first game is good too.  The controls, graphics, audio, gameplay and story on both games are really solid, with good-to-great voice acting.  If you like any of the Legacy of Kain games, I really can't recommend this and the first Darksiders enough.\n\nYes, it'd be nice if no one who owned the previous release had to pay for this upgrade, but it IS an upgrade that required developer and artist labor and the publisher needs to capitalize on this update in order to fund future development in the series since they bought the property from THQ and got none of any profit that THQ got from the original's sales.   Please understand that the publisher literally can't afford to just give it away for free and they are giving hefty discounts to people with the previous release.  I bet the people on the Xbox One and the PS4 aren't getting any such favors.\n\nThis game is great and it deserves a sequel (preferably w/ 4-player Co-op) and we're probably not going to see that sequel if the publisher can't get a bit of capital out of this release, so please ignore all the people whining about how they're not getting something for free.","November 6, 2015","true","51.6"," 10 of 27 people (37%) found this review helpful","37","10","27","0","0"

I didn't play the first very much because I didn't like it, and haden't tried 2 yet.\n\nI was initially surprised about all the negative reviews on here, since in the start I had no problems. The game is really good and fun. Then I came over more and more bugs and flaws, and I just can't recommend the game in it's current state.\n\nSome bugs/big downsides:\n- When changing video settings, you have to restart the whole game.\n\n- When changing mouse sensitivity, the game freezes on a white background and you have to close it.\n\n- Climbing on whines is often bugged in a way that you have to spam wasd in a dirrection to move because you won't move when holding the button down. It looks like the engine is treating it as many small whine-walls instead of one bigger one.\n\n- In 7 hours, I had 2 random crashes. And I often crashes if I alt + tab. I use 2 monitors, and just moving the mouse over to the other monitor and clicking on Chrome to select it, does not crash the game.\n\n- I can not progress the game any further because of a bug that is crashing the game everytime. When I follow the storyline and have to collect a certain key from a certain angel, if I let the cutscene play normally, the game crashed after a minute or two at the same spot, if I try to skip the scene, the game crashes right away. There's no way around this bug that I have found so far.\n\n- The sound settings volum doesn't adjust certain sounds and scenes. The recap in loading screen when you start the game from a save is quite loud, some random sound effect are loud, and some boss cut-scenes are loud. I don't want to change Windows volum, since I often do more things while gaming.\n\nSome general pros and cons:\n\nPros\n\n+ The fighting in the game is one of it's best features, lots of comboes, different attack styles, special weapon abilities and dodging. When fighting bosses you have to observe and learn how to fight the boss you're facing, or you'll die.\n\n+ Loot balance is good, different levels and rarities drop from all kinds of enemies and chests.\n\n+ Fast travel and a decently large world.\n\n+ Background music\n\n+ No loading screens besides when you fast travel and "teleport"\n\n+ Cool VFX\n\nCons\n\n- Bugs\n\n- The world is restricted, it's not open-world in the sence of WoW or Skyrim. There's also only characters that affect the main storyline, which doesn't help with the world building.\n\n- Side quests are (so far, 7 hours in) only collecting certain items along the main storyline, there's no additional stories or fights. Also a downside for world building.\n\n- A lot of people say they can't even run the game. For me it's not running too bad. (when it doesn't crash)\n\n- Some inconsistencies in what cutscenes you can skip, I can often only skip the scenes I want to watch, like those with story.\n\n\nI will update this review if bugs are fixed until I am able to finish the game. If the game is updated to stop it from crashing and I can actually proceed in the story, I will recommend it with a warning of the other problems.","November 9, 2015","false","12.1"," 2 of 11 people (18%) found this review helpful","18","2","11","0","0"

The Deathinitive Edition offers an additional difficulty level, improved visuals (especially lighting), and rebalanced loot and enemies.\n\nIf you've already played Darksiders II before, it's the same game you know and love but prettier. If you've never played Darksiders II, it's a wild ride and a very challenging experience. The combat is visceral and the controls tight and responsive. There are some minor camera issues but you'll learn to adjust to the controls (gamepad highly recommended).\n\nPlayers new to the series should start with and beat Darksiders I first, before moving onto this title, to get the full breadth of the detailed and winding story. The Darksiders franchise offers a lot to love, from the art and music direction to the weapon skills and enemies. Darksiders II picks up the torch and never slips up.\n\nThis is one game (franchise) I highly recommend. This remaster in particular is 100% faithful to the original and definitely a good bit harder and prettier.\n\n\nTechnical Issues\n1.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CTOBN/recommended/388410/","CTOBN","Can'tThinkofBetterName","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CTOBN/","177 products in account","OK So for starters I haven't beaten the game, original or Deathinitive. I got the franchise pack on sale earlier this year. I was pleasantly surprised today that the Deathinitive edition was coming to PC already, let alone that I got it free (yes I know that some people who got the steam version and the DLC for it did not get it free and that sucks, like, really sucks), but I noticed that the game has a lot of negative reviews on steam, mostly for framerate issues and crashes upon loading a save.\n\nFor starters, the crashing upon loading a save is due to issues with maxed out shadows. I don't know why this happens but you can easily turn it down a notch in the old Darksiders II and it should work (it did for me). If you don't have the original version and you max out shadows I'm certain there's a way to edit options.dopt to fix it. The shadow quality is still much higher than the blocky shadow textures in the original version regardless.\n\nAnother issue I came across was that the resolution was much higher than it was supposed to be. and since my resolution before was 3840x2160 it resulted in me only being able to see a quarter of the screen. I set the game to 1080p fullscreen before switching back and it worked fine after that. Not sure which of the 2 fixed it though.\n\nAs for framerate issues (note that I only tested in the City of the Dead, it's where my save file was when the Deathinitive edition released) I have a GTX 980 running the game at 3840x2160 windowed (forced borderless) with second highest shadow quality, no anti aliasing, and anistrophic filtering on. My framerate didn't drop below 50 during gameplay. That's not great for a game with limited graphics options but you can lower other things. This may just be my graphics card and it may be a serious plague to people with less powerful GPU's (even at 1920x1080) but I can't say for certain.\n\nAs far as improvements go it's mostly graphical (although I do like the graphical improvements quite a bit) but I feel like the aiming controls with a controller improved a lot. Before if I did light flicks to position my cursor precisely every 3rd flick would send the cursor flying, screwing up my aim. Fortunately that is no longer an issue. And I don't know if this is typical for remasters of PC games (on PC) but my save file did carry over to the deathinitive edition, which was a nice surprise for me. And of course the game is still very solid on it's own merits. Not the greatest PC port, or PC remaster but it's servicable and the game itself is great. If nothing else it's a better PC port than the one the first Darksiders got.","November 5, 2015","true","24.8"," 15 of 40 people (38%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","38","15","40","2","0"

I love the Darksiders series and even for 6$ this is a nice update. I want to support the devs because I want Darksiders 3 to happen.\n\nThe crash to desktop can be fixed. Just look into the discussion of the community hub.\n\nAs for the ♥♥♥♥♥torm because of the franchise pack vs. bought everything seperately: That is really ridiculous. All this drama because of 6$? 80% discount is very friendly for everyone.

But it just don't work for me, and from a lot of the reviews i've seen this seems to be the case.\n\nNordic Games, I hear you did this dethfinitive stuff to see if there is interest in the franchise.

Although it had some really nasty bugs during its initial release, the developers had fixed them (at least in public beta) and now it runs very well on my laptop.\nCurrent Issues: They are small and do npt pose serious problems to pro gamers.\na) On your way to the Drenchfort, there's a chance that you will fall infinitely and eventually die while you're riding the horse.\nb) The Makers' chest area (Aylia) seem to have a resolution issue, since its texture was not smooth but made of chunks of small squares.\nc) The game wouldn't stop running after you exit sometimes. It happens occasionally when you've played the game for several hours.\nLet's talk about the pros:\nBesides the apparent better texture and shaders, the gameplay system in this remastered edition  is well-balanced. Old players won't really appreciate the beauty of it until the later stage of the game. I personally had complained about not being able to access my DLC weapons instantly before. Now I actually think it is a well-considered idea to let players gain access to them "when the time is right". Trust me, it makes the gameplay so much smoother, because you get to use better weapons and armors when you really need them.\n\nComment: Changed my opinion from Not Recommend to Recommended. Still, looking forward to seeing the developers improve the game further.","November 7, 2015","true","71.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has an additional, harder difficulty, but the biggest change is a new coat of paint.  If visuals don't warrant the asking price for you, there's no need to upgrade, although this edition does come with all of the DLC.\n\nThat said, the game is very good.  Being an old vet, I went straight to the Deathinitive difficulty and found it genuinely challenging.  At times, I thought that certain enemies were unfairly tough, especially in optional dungeons, but the game is still fun and rewarding.  If you're coming from the original version, the mechanics are unchanged and you can still infinitely combo pop-ups to aerials to lock enemies and heal for free with the Black Demise weapon, use that info how you will.\n\nThe distribution of unique items is, I think, changed a bit, but I may be remembering wrong.  The Crow, Maker, Angel, and Shadow sets are now found in hidden chests or as rewards instead of distributed at the Serpent's Tome.  The sidequests are largely the same.\n\nSpeaking of, the sidequests are unchanged, and thus still absurdly tedious.  Chasing stonebites is a pain, as it always has been, while the rest are "go here, do that, come back".  Not worth it for completionist types, but they do provide tangible rewards for those that do.\n\nStill, the combat is clean, the world is interesting if not vast, and some of the later puzzles are legitimately clever.  Clearing dungeons requires more button skill than cleverness, while secret hunting requires a good amount of both.  The narrative, while not great, at least makes the player's short-term goals clear.  It's a fun game to pick up, and for me has been worth it for four runs so far across the two editions.","December 4, 2015","true","31.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I bought this on sale in a pack and hoped against hope that my luck with glitchy games would hold out to at least tolerable glitch levels. However, I can't get as much playtime as I would like to due to control issues:\n\n*sticky controls/slow response (especially SHIFT to focus)\n*after saving/opening menus, some keys randomly don't work or character does not respond at all to controls\n*sometimes controls just stop working entirely for no reason regardless of opening/closing menus.\n\nFor a while I was able to 'resolve' it most of the time by restarting my game. Cool cool no problem until it started taking me back to a random older save, usually 1 to 3 saves back. Very glad playing RPGs have taught me to save frequently so it's not that much of a hassle to catch up.\n\nMy laptop more than meets the required specs so I don't think it's my hardware. Steam games are pricey for me (even on sale bc currency exchange rate) and I'm pretty bummed out that I can't keep playing this super fun game :(\n\n","May 5","true","1.9"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

Death has a surprising large number of different moves, creating endless possibilities for combos, delivering an action battle experience comparable even to that of Devil May Cry.\n* More wall action. Death can run along or jump off from walls, an ability that makes walls much more than room dividers.\n* Level system, equipments and quest system.\n\nOn the other hand, Darksiders II is inferior to Zelda in the following ways:\n* Limited camera adjustment. In aiming mode you cannot aim more than about 45 degrees up or down from horizontal. When clinging to walls, sometimes the camera is in such an awkward position that you cannot see the next target that you should jump to, and it's almost not movable at all, leaving you wondering if you hit a dead end.\n* Focusing on one enemy does not stop others from attacking. Yes I know that Zelda: Ocarina of Time did this because player had little control over camera position, and in Darksiders II now we have that control. However here the camera is so close to Death that, at any time a forgotten enemy may jump out from behind the camera and give Death an unforeseen, unavoidable attack. It feels not fair.\n* Crashes, glitches and soft locks. There had been once when I got locked in a room, because one enemy failed to appear, and I was supposed to defeat that enemy to proceed. Just imagine how much time I wasted examining everything in the room.\n\nIn conclusion, I do see the developers paying tribute to Zelda games (heavily so). They did learn and copy the Zelda spirit perfectly, throwing in their own creativity here and there, but there are also unignorable problems that affect the player experience. Had improvements been made, this game could become perfect.\n\n+ Zelda elements\n+ Intense battles\n- Awkward camera\n- Glitches\n7 out of 10, good.","April 17","true","17.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sometimes the enemies are killing you from a bunch of blows and you can't react, on deathinitive difficulty you can say that you play Dark Souls, you need to be a bit careful in choosing your gear and build. The controls are a bit broken, they don't respond sometimes and this can be very difficult when you need to execute your enemies for example, pressing the E key multiple times don't help to much. The grafic on this version is very nice but it's still suffering from flickering and other glitches, the music is nice and the sound can be bugged sometimes. I still recommend this game if you can get it a little cheaper on a sale or something. I tested this game on Win 10 and is working very good, most of the crashes I had were from alt+tab.\n\nLE: In Deathinitive Edition you won't have the DLC items from the beginning of the game like in original version, you need to find them.","May 21","true","98.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

First, the genre, while the 1st game is more a standard hack n slash action game, this one is more like a simplified RPG game. It combined all the good things from legacy games such as: Soul Reaver, Devil May Cry, and... Portal.\n\nCompared to the 1st game, this one has longer story, great voice acting, better game mechanics, bigger and more varied maps, different gears to loot from chests, inventory management, and of course better graphics. The game design (maps, characters, puzzle, gears) shows how the developer really put their best effort into it. I'm looking forward to Darksiders III.\n\nCONCLUSION :\nRecommended on full price, a must-have on sale price.","April 26","true","95.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Death has a surprising large number of different moves, creating endless possibilities for combos, delivering an action battle experience comparable even to that of Devil May Cry.\n* More wall action. Death can run along or jump off from walls, an ability that makes walls much more than room dividers.\n* Level system, equipments and quest system.\n\nOn the other hand, Darksiders II is inferior to Zelda in the following ways:\n* Limited camera adjustment. In aiming mode you cannot aim more than about 45 degrees up or down from horizontal. When clinging to walls, sometimes the camera is in such an awkward position that you cannot see the next target that you should jump to, and it's almost not movable at all, leaving you wondering if you hit a dead end.\n* Focusing on one enemy does not stop others from attacking. Yes I know that Zelda: Ocarina of Time did this because player had little control over camera position, and in Darksiders II now we have that control. However here the camera is so close to Death that, at any time a forgotten enemy may jump out from behind the camera and give Death an unforeseen, unavoidable attack. It feels not fair.\n* Crashes, glitches and soft locks. There had been once when I got locked in a room, because one enemy failed to appear, and I was supposed to defeat that enemy to proceed. Just imagine how much time I wasted examining everything in the room.\n\nIn conclusion, I do see the developers paying tribute to Zelda games (heavily so). They did learn and copy the Zelda spirit perfectly, throwing in their own creativity here and there, but there are also unignorable problems that affect the player experience. Had improvements been made, this game could become perfect.\n\n+ Zelda elements\n+ Intense battles\n- Awkward camera\n- Glitches\n7 out of 10, good.","April 17","true","17.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was on sale for $3.00 when I bought it on a Steam sale. If you look at buying this game at all, I reccomend waiting until it goes on sale. While the game was fun and kept my attention, I am still rating this with a thumbs down because of the many down sides to the game. The game crashed on me several times throughout my playthrough, probably once every 2-3 hours worth of gameplay at various points in the game. While there are a few sidequests you can pick up pretty late into the game, the main storyline is quite linear. And while Darksiders 1 was a very pure game at heart with it's combat and puzzle solving, Darksiders 2 attempted to give more of an RPG feel to it's game. Unfortunately, I don't think it did much to add to the game at all. The leveling is nothing more than arbitrary, and  the random loot drops are needless and excessive in most cases.\n\nThe puzzle solving was fun for the first half of the game, however, at a certain point the game just felt like it kept dragging on and on. You meet a new NPC, and he needs you to go run an errand for him, and then after spending an hour going to collect a few things for the NPC, you go meet another NPC and it's just rinse and repeat, even 15-20 hours later.\n\nThe biggest negative for me was about 19 hours into the game, I ran into a very serious crash bug during a cutscene at Archon's citadel. Restarting the game didn't help, the crash occured in the same place. Skipping the cutscene didn't help, would crash immediately. Checked the forums, and the devs said that they found an issue and would patch it asap, however, that was a post from 3 years ago, and clearly the game was never patched to fix it. Many people reported that leveling up, or talking to a few different NPC's fixed the issue for them, but I had no such luck. So I am done with this game. This is even the new shiny Deathinitive edition, and it still had many crash issues. Disappointing.\n\nHowever, I got my money's worth from the game. All said, if you are looking for a cool puzzle solving game like Zelda with the combat of God of War, perhaps this is a game for you. But if you hate games that make you feel like "I've been here and done this a hundred times before", then pass this one on by.","April 22","false","20.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When clinging to walls, sometimes the camera is in such an awkward position that you cannot see the next target that you should jump to, and it's almost not movable at all, leaving you wondering if you hit a dead end.\n* Focusing on one enemy does not stop others from attacking. Yes I know that Zelda: Ocarina of Time did this because player had little control over camera position, and in Darksiders II now we have that control. However here the camera is so close to Death that, at any time a forgotten enemy may jump out from behind the camera and give Death an unforeseen, unavoidable attack. It feels not fair.\n* Crashes, glitches and soft locks. There had been once when I got locked in a room, because one enemy failed to appear, and I was supposed to defeat that enemy to proceed. Just imagine how much time I wasted examining everything in the room.\n\nIn conclusion, I do see the developers paying tribute to Zelda games (heavily so). They did learn and copy the Zelda spirit perfectly, throwing in their own creativity here and there, but there are also unignorable problems that affect the player experience. Had improvements been made, this game could become perfect.\n\n+ Zelda elements\n+ Intense battles\n- Awkward camera\n- Glitches\n7 out of 10, good.","April 17","true","17.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Fun hack 'n' slash combat, great storyline & voice acting but broken game.\n\nI haven't played other games from this series yet but I'm really enjoying this one. I bought this on sale in a pack and hoped against hope that my luck with glitchy games would hold out to at least tolerable glitch levels. However, I can't get as much playtime as I would like to due to control issues:\n\n*sticky controls/slow response (especially SHIFT to focus)\n*after saving/opening menus, some keys randomly don't work or character does not respond at all to controls\n*sometimes controls just stop working entirely for no reason regardless of opening/closing menus.\n\nFor a while I was able to 'resolve' it most of the time by restarting my game. Cool cool no problem until it started taking me back to a random older save, usually 1 to 3 saves back. Very glad playing RPGs have taught me to save frequently so it's not that much of a hassle to catch up.\n\nMy laptop more than meets the required specs so I don't think it's my hardware. Steam games are pricey for me (even on sale bc currency exchange rate) and I'm pretty bummed out that I can't keep playing this super fun game :(\n\n","May 5","true","1.9"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

It looks a little prettier, but the main game felt mostly the same; however, whatever changed was enough to carry me through the last 5 hours to actually beat the thing.\n\nHaving played all the way through, I have to say I would recommend it; the graphical improvements are nice, and the base game is pretty solid, too.

I know it is a different character (Death instead of War) but I think they changed a little too much, and not necessarily for the better. Graphicly it doesn't look any better than the first, yet my Alienware laptop running a 660M graphics card struggles on frame rate and it didn't on the first edition. It took a while to find an input arrangement I liked, this was not the case with the first one. But once I got used to the differences, I started getting into the game. The addition of controller support improved things, but as I had got used to keyboard and mouse with Darksiders I reverted back to them instead. As I write I have about 12 hours of play, and am really getting into the game. I don't understand how this game follows on from the first, (maybe I skipped some important cut scenes) but there is a good blend of puzzle and hack 'n' slash like the first. For the 5 pounds I paid for both games I highly recommend their purchase.","May 10","true","19.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I bought this version after backing up my original DSII data and was happy to see that it had fixed the one save data bug. The bad news is it added about ten others in the process. Book of the Dead Pages started falling through the floor, audio was desynced at points, and during the Samael boss fight, he simply didn't appear again after one of his teleporting attacks. I encountered these problems after playing through about 90% of the game. (Finished The Black Stone before things started bugging out).

Only wish it was a larger world and a lot more side-quests. Wish it were never ending really. With weekly new missions and stuff lol.

I bought it on sale for 3Euro , but now , after I played almost 50 hours , I would buy it even for 30. Really nice graphics , gameplay is just amazing , you can choose from many weapons , awesome quests ,the story is pretty much ok , BUT there are some major bugs with the saves , and some in game bugs . So be ready to search it out on the internet , and do not panic . But the overall game is amazing , definitely buy it if you like hack n slash games or you played Darksiders 1 .","June 5","true","47.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
