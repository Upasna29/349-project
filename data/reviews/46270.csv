Sadly, I don't trust his video-game taste that much, so I ignored that...Until yesterday, I saw this game at 0,99€ because of a sale. Only an euro?! Dude, I get that back in two days by idling! So, did I like the game in the end?\n\nSurprisingly, IT'S GOOD! Now, hear me on this one, the game is nowhere perfect. It has issues, and as usual, I will talk about the bad things of the game first, to take them out of the way.\n\nThe first, and worst issue of them all is the voice acting. HOLY MOTHER OF F#CK, THE VOICES ARE DREADFUL. They're not AS bad as games like Ride to Hell, but they're still terrible. I can understand it, since the game was made in Russia, though. Old Spanish games like Praetorians also had terrible English voice-acting...But it's still an issue in the end. The cutscenes also look really dull and outdated. Now, I know the game is old, from 2006, BUT FOR F#CK SAKE, THERE WERE GAMES LIKE HALF LIFE 2 IN 2004 ALREADY! Another problem I see with the game, is the IA. When you tell a ship to go somewhere, they try to go there in a straight line, instead of dodging anything that's on their way. I have already lost 2 ships, because they tried to go through a space-station. THEY LITERALLY DID THAT. JUST RAM INTO IT. WHAT THE F#CK, MAN?! Another pain in the ♥♥♥ is the resolution, I can't put the resolution I have on it, so it looks weird. It's not the first time I see something like this, though, games like Warcraft III already had that issue, because they where made for 4:3 screens, and now everything is widescreen. The last minor issue, is the music. Why is a minor issue? Well, it's really generic and dull...But you can get used to it. Or just mute it, and play something else on your computer.\n\nNow, that being said, what's left is a weird game that's unique, or at least it was on it's time. A hybrid between space-strategy games and RPG, with bits of Rogue-like gameplay. If you want a comparison, let me just say: This game is like mixing "Knights of the Old Republic" 's chat system, "Homeworld" 's gameplay, and "FTL" 's Rogue-like and RPG elements.\n\nYou start on some sort of "Space-Burger-King", were you can read news, trade, and go into new adventures. Whatever quest you accept, will send you into a new map, with the stuff you gotta do: Escort someone, send cargo, hunt someone who was a bounty on their heads, or just plain killing spree. The more you play, the more pilots you will get to join your team, and the more you advance, the more stuff you will be able to buy.\n\nThe game's graphics might be outdated, but for a GOD DAMN EURO, this game has quite a lot to bring. If you're a fan of Homeworld, or FTL, you might like the game. If you liked them both, then there's no reason NOT to buy the game. Just get ready to get your ears blown up by bad voice acting. Oh, and if you're interested, you can get the sequels quite cheap this week as well. I think the second game was 2€, and the third one 3€. Getting them all for 6€ is quite a deal, on my opinion.","October 7, 2014","true","4.5"," 59 of 65 people (91%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","91","59","65","8","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/recommended/46270/","kschang77","kschang77","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/","993 products in account","Star Wolves is a hard game to describe. It's probably best described as a space battle manager where you are managing this mercenary group, Star Wolves, in performing missions for the highest bidder (but you do get to choose). You don't control the crafts directly, but you give waypoints, and attack orders, missile launches and defenses, and so on. You can configure each fighter for different roles: missile defense (jamming), support, escort, attack, and so on. The mothership is also under your command and serves as repair and rearm station for all the fighters, and it is armed with multiple turrets (albeit, it can be overwhelmed). The idea is to defeat the enemy forces without suffering losses of your own by managing your resources: the pilots and the fighters, carefully. Each pilot has his or her own skill tree and can be unlocked with experience points, which opens up special abilities that can be tapped in battle, such as better accuracy, double defense for 30 seconds, and so on.  There is also a bit of trading and salvage as you can often salvage weapons and missiles off destroyed enemy ships, and sometimes, even steal whole fighters. Plot is somewhat on the lame side, and most dialogs are in text only, but graphics are good. All in all, it depends what sort of gamer are you. If you want hands-on fly-the-ship kind this is NOT for you. But if you like giving orders and see them carried out this is good for you.","July 14, 2013","true","45.7"," 32 of 32 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","32","32","0","0"

That said, I can definitely recomend Star Wolves (1).  It's a bit limiting in it's budgetary balance, and like many old school RPGs between battle maps, towns are little more than an interface screen.  The good aspects come from in game choices leading to different forking game paths.  Having more than 1 ways to solve a puzzle etc.\n\nFighters can be reconfigured or replaced at the space ports between missions, if the item you want is there for sale.  It might be old, but it is a fun game.  Especially for what they are asking.","September 29, 2014","true","29.2"," 21 of 21 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","21","21","0","0"

Sometimes you'll find yourself raging after a short skirmish with the Aliens, sometimes after defeating tons of enemy ships you'll manage to steal expensive equipment - weaponry, modules, rockets, even fighters - and your evil laughter may scare the living $**T out of your neighbours. Well at least this is my experience with Star Wolves.\n\nI really like how strategy and RPG are mixed in this game. It gives you opportunity to build your squadron to match your playstile. Star Wolves also has a decent story and some WTF moments. The graphics are not bad for a title released in 2004. Ships, weapons, stations are all well designed (coming from a sci-fi nerd) and if you're into this stuff, most of them have a description (kind of cool to read how this fighter and this gun were used in some battle not long ago). There are some bugs that may lead to unfortunate destruction of your ships (your pilots may perform excellent under fire, but when it comes to performing maneuvers near space stations...Oh dear)  - recommend to use the Save option frequently. The voice acting is awful. AWFUL. But the music and the other sound effects are OK.\n\nI enjoyed Star Wolves. It made me angry, it made me happy, it made me intrigued. Should you buy it? In my opinion, for 5 euros you get a really nice and addictive game.\n\nP.S. Watch out for those space stations!\n","November 1, 2014","true","3.9"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","13","13","0","0"

I never really enjoyed Homeworld but I really enjoyed Star Wolves.  The gameplay sort of reminds me of Mechcommander 2 as far as RTS combat goes, I like being able to pause and give orders to  my units.  Most of the lower level weapons are useless, and there is no point keeping lower tier fighters around in your mother ship, but these faults are minor.  The campaign is fairly long and the game is just plain fun, which is the way games are supposed to be.  I only paid $1.39 Canadian for this and it was an absolute steal, at regular price it's still a very good buy.  This was one of the best games I bought in 2014, and a pleasant surprise considering the price, highly recommend this game.","January 11, 2015","true","42.9"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

A good strategy space game. If you dont like strategy nor space, then maybe you should pass.\n\nSo far, I've had a really good time playing Space Wolves. There is a decent amount of ship customization, and basic character building elements change how your character plays. There is a decent variety of ships available, mixing things up. The missions arent boring and you stay engaged while playing. There are some tough choices to make occasionally, so you feel like your have a say in how the game plays out. You get to select the order you play your missions, like a real mercenary. The graphics are 2005-2007ish, which still looks decent, and it can have its beautiful moments, like when you explode the enemy capital ships.\n\nThose are all of the good things.\n\nThere are a few bad things, but they are not so bad as to overshadow the good things done here.\nFirstly, you cannot (to my knowledge) customize the controls in the game. This is an issue usually, but so many of the controls are on the mouse that it hardly makes a difference. I am sure there are ways to change the controls elsewhere, but users shouldnt have to do that.\n\nSecondly, there a few bugs that happen occasionally which are annoying. I've only encountered one, which crashes the game when you try moving ships in your inventory. It only happened twice, and now I save more frequently, so it doesnt make much of a difference.\n\nLastly, the english dubbing is laughable at best. The game was obviously not made by native english speakers. Alot of the common sayings in english are absent, and it makes things sound really awkward. Also, some of the voices in the game sound like they are supposed to be robotic/computerized, but no voice modulation was made, so they sound human, which is creepy. Each time I meet a new character, I laugh at their voice acting, that's how bad it is.\n\nAll things considered, it's important to remember this game is normally $5, and I obtained it for $1 on sale.\nWith a price like that, this was a huge deal. I very much like this game.\n","October 10, 2014","true","63.9"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

Probably best described as a diamond in the rough, this game's strengths are not immediately visible.\n\nThe initial impression might be rather unfavourable - the user interface and menus could use some work, only two resolutions are supported, controls take a bit to get used to, and the most annoying one: it's painfully evident the script-writer's English wasn't his forte (same for voice actors).\n\nStill, once past all that the game uses a good-looking graphical engine, the combat mechanics are solid, and the game universe is not only large but also quite elaborate - historical and current events are presented with lots of detail, the various factions each have their own distinct flavours, and the story offers interesting twists and turns, as well as a fair amount of choices that affect how future events unfold.\n\nAt £9.99 Star Wolves is a bit too pricey, but a good discount will make the game a worthwhile play for fans of the genre.","September 2, 2012","true","26.4"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

Graphics are decent and gamplay is smooth; only getting buggy when you try to load a save or cutscene while 4x-time is turned on. The campaign is long and the music soundtrack is quite good.

This game was developed by talented professionals from X-Bow Software, a small company which later evolved into Ino-Co Plus (games which they have created include such titles as Fantasy Wars,   Elven Legacy,  Majesty 2 and the  Warlock series). Despite being a relatively old game, Star Wolves possesses all the necessary qualities in order to leave a good impression on the player even today, 11 years after it first came out on the market.\n\nGameplay is the foundation of this strategic RPG. While both in-depth and intense, gameplay in Star Wolves could hardly be called original. Prior to the beginning of every assignment, the player is tasked to equip his team of mercenary pilots with ships, weapons and various systems which can be acquired on the market and are then installed on the ships. Later during the missions, the pilots operate these ships, and every piece of equipment and weaponry plays it's part in the players success. The Mothership also plays a crucial role and can also be upgraded with different weapons and systems. During in-game battles, the possible destruction of the Mothership equals mission failure, and the player thus has to protect his base ship at all costs. Every member of the team has a skill tree which develops as the player progresses in the game. There are four different branches in this skill tree all of which have different roles, both offensive and defensive. Each character in your team will have a small range of unique abilities which will also be highly important during the single player campaign, and the player must use them wisely. In-game battles are more or less predictable, and the player will often find himself reloading the game in order to prevent loss of his own fighter ships. Regardless, the way space combat is implemented in Star Wolves is interesting and full of fiery explosions, so fans of Homeworld  and other space strategies will find it to their liking. During the course of their adventures, players will encounter different factions ranging from pirate scum and private military companies of mega corporations to ancient alien races and menacing robots. All of these factions possess their own unique units, and every enemy should be dealt with by means of a unique approach and strategy. Interface within the game is simple and is very easy to get used to, although sometimes the camera can be annoying due to several levels of the spacial dimension which is present in the game. For this reason, the player must learn to raise and lower the trajectory of his Mothership during missions, but this can be easily achieved and poses no problems once gotten used to. In a short summary, gameplay in Star Wolves is based on simple roleplaying elements, and better ships with good weaponry manned by experienced pilots will dominate the space. Battles usually take form of a limited scale, although as the plotline progresses, there will be certain assignments with greater sized battles.\n\nIn Star Wolves, the graphics, despite the game's age, are still very neat and pleasent to observe. While being mostly identical throughout the entire campaign, the surrounding environment will still alter somewhat from mission to mission, mainly because the player will progress throughout the plotline by doing assignments in different star systems. In game, the different variety of ships and other structures all have their unique appearance and alot of flavor text. In short, the atmosphere is very consistent and by it's quality shows that is was done with skill and attention. On the downside, the cinematics are hilarious (in a good way), even though the creators of the game obviously didn't intend them to be like that. Still, it takes special skill to make cinematic graphics, so it's no big deal. Audio is of lesser quality, although it's not terrible. Background music in Star Wolves is repetitive, but by no means annoying. The sounds themselves (lasers, explosions, etc) are run of the mill, nothing special or dynamic, but again, as stated earlier in this review, Star Wolves is about gameplay, the sound is present, and that's good enough.\n\nAs an afterword, it can be concluded with confidence, that Star Wolves is a good RPG which players will enjoy. The game does in-fact require some time getting used to, but if the player is willing to spend this time, he won't be disappointed.\n\nPost Scriptum - Interesting fact: The future name of X-Bow Software was already present in Star Wolves, under the name of InoCo - one of the three mega corporations which struggle for space dominance. It seems that the team at X-Bow liked their own creation so much that they later decided to name their new company after it :)","November 1, 2015","true","64.3"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

You will earn experience on missions to level up your characters perks after choosen tech tree. There is in total 4 tech tree's to choose from with different type of perks. And this is cool as you will do this on all your fighter pilots as well. Want to be better gunner just put points there or better in flying avoiding missiles put some there as well.

It has it strengths, it has its weaknesses, depending on what someone expects it can be a very interesting game.\n\n+ RPG Part\nSkill/Perk system is not very complex but functional, various paths can be used for skilling the characters. The different paths lead to a slightly different gameplay approach. Could be more complex, but works nice and is motivating.\n\n+ Fighters and Equipment\nDuring the campaign you will slowly move up the tier-ladder with your fighters and their setup as you can buy new fighters and equipment for money after every mission. Also over time the things you can purchase get better to reflect the research taking part during the story. There is a variety in all tiers (light-, heavy-, special fighters and such) and you can choose between different gear (guns, missiles, systems) for your fighters.\nYou also get stuff for free during the missions and you can collect leftover items after every fight. This parts can be used or sold afterwards. All in all this part of the game works well, the progression over time feels "natural".\n\no Combat\nYou would expect the space battles to be more complex and strategic, but sadly there is not much to do for this part. You can use various approches, but all in all the most battles are to easy. The only problems occur with bad luck and some mass-fights where you are heavily outnumbered.\n\no Story\nThe story is only average, but at least you have different approaches in various missions. Some decisions have consequences (like different rewards, new characters joining, etc.) and there are two endings. All in all average.\n\n- Presentation and Controls\nWhile the look is average and OK for such a game the presentation is terrible. The controls are overloaded, but after a while you can get away with mouse and spacebar.\n\n- Bugs\nTechnical wise you can be lucky like me (no problems) or have the worst problems with alot of crashes. Seems its not tested with alot of configurations. The KI is not very good, alot of times ships get stuck or fly into each other. Another problem arises when some scripts do not trigger as you have to reload from last save then.\n\nSo, all in all I can recommend this game only for ppl who like tactical space games and when it is on sale. If you do every sidequest, scout most parts of all maps and take your time with the RPG- and loadout things you will have around 20 hours of fun, headbanging, crying, loling and various other things. Not bad for that price.","December 28, 2014","true","21.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Playing through on normal is challenging, but not impossible. The limited resources make you choose between equipment and skills, and time the use of your abilities - which are limited in the number of times they can be used each mission.\n\nWhile the game play isn't entirely story-driven, there is a story here, and it's interesting to be in the role of a supporting character/group rather than the movers and shakers. There are also moral choices you have to make during the course of the game. I don't think these have meaningful consequences other than the amount of money you have, but it does give an element of actual role-playing.\n\nHowever, there are a few issues with this game. First, it does tend to crash. Second, there is a bug that causes laser fire to remain rendered and prevents most hits to ships on either side of a conflict. This bug, while annoying, is easily corrected by restarting the game. Another problem is that ships will sometimes get stuck on objects and are unable to get loose. This is largely due to the fact that the ships have to move in a straight line to the target object or location rather than coming about. Also, the ships will run straight into anything that is in their path rather than swerving to avoid a collision - sometimes causing damage to the ship in question.\n\nWhile this game has some issues and drawbacks, it was really fun to play through, and I did very much enjoy the music to the game.","May 16, 2015","true","32.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Now that that's over with =>\n\nAny CONS that this game might have? As much as I like it the game is not perfect albeit far from it:\n- the AI and pathing are horrible(or close to horrible?) Not only will your enthusiastic pilots fly too close to a station but sometimes will fly right through it(uhhm, kboom anyone?)\n- Voice acting (two worlds anyone?), it would be funny if it weren't so bad\n- Might feel a little rough on the edges with the movement and camera.\n- Any difficulty level below Hard might make the game too easy.\n- Space battles are not that complex\n- A little bit linear.\n\nThe PROS of this game ? Well imo, I guess it feels like a RPG Homeworld game( Maybe it can be compared to Dawn of War 2 and WH 40K? )\n- Voice acting, (same actor different accents? ), it would be bad if it weren't so funny\n- It's different (or it was at least)\n- Quite addictive\n- It's fun\n- Offers multiple endings (only 2)\n- Decent amount of ship and character customisation.\n\n\nAll in all it might be a little overpriced considering what it offers but if you can get it on a sale it's a definite purchase for space RTS and RPG fans and a definite don't buy for people who don't like the genre.","November 30, 2015","true","32.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/playoftheyear/recommended/46270/","playoftheyear","playoftheyear","http://steamcommunity.com/id/playoftheyear/","142 products in account","I would recomend Star Wolves as a niche game, meaning if you like Turned/Real time strategy(you can pause and issue orders), like spacesship games, like RPG elements(skill tree), lack of resource gathering - OOPS sorry the main thing to grab is money, why, because in this game you and your comrades are merceneraries with a touch of good or bad - Good = money.\nThere is no telling what the developers were thinking when creating this game or could be rather mundane in its delivery. I am pretty sure though that the crisp (for their time) graphics go well with the insanely grindy,jammy, catchy metal music. Other music has that distinct cowboy on the fringe of his territory distinction, think The Good, the Bad and the Ugly in space.\nGraphics shine in the fact that - you have complete control of the camera and can zoom in on explosions, which are inspiring, or ships, nice designs, low detail until you begin loading newer guns on them. Think sportscar/spaceship. While there is plenty of ships to use this brings a question if the game is too drawn out. There is one opening cinema and that is all that I seen since. Nice voice overs for News Reports and Mission Explanations, not much diversity in your pilots though as sometimes they talk over the radio chatter in game during combat and such using same voices it seems, because the action is where it is at.\nMissions are contracts there to present objectives completed to meet new objectives maybe a couple surprises if you want to help patrols or other mercenaries out. It nets you more money and experience both used to upgrade ship parts and maneuver through the skills tree.\nMany equipment choices is a shining point of this game. With different slots for different ships with different capabilities had me interestingly taking my time devising a working inventory to proceed with. Noone likes losing a mission, it will happen, trying some new guns or healing unit can be the difference, also technnique plays a role in the field too. You will try again and again to beat a certain part, do not worry, it will come to you and easily at that, but you get what you put into it.\nPlaying this game...experiencing this game is something to behold. Space is a large desolate space with sometimes blinding gorgeous backdrops, science fiction was formed through imagination that begot imagination. There is plenty of that in here, and much to see. Those are the goods!\n\nEDIT - SPOILERS\nI dont know how star wolves gets me. I can be completely frustrated over mission defeats or even losing a ship. The game is random to a degree of doing the same thing could result in a win when before reload was a loss. But thats is why every move and ability used counts toward success.\nAfter beating the game at 40 hours, I sat back to reflect on the amazing graphics which get better the deeper you play, stylized effects and larger battles explode with newer colors 10x over than early game. But the antagonizing system will have even more disregard for your squad by forcing you to reload because of a miniscule errors which regularly is the game's miscalclations of movements. Thus it is a necessity to save often and in different slots. For instance, let autosave work when mission is complete, save after shopping/allocating points, choose next mission then save after every lull in combat/exploration or change of objective. My save file looked something like this: autosave, mid mish, new save, quicksave, then overwritng per mission. Major gripe is scavenging ship parts, tiny targetting. Missions range from easy to very difficult.\nI come to grips  with this being not a frustration but an infatuation. I never wanted my ships to get destroyed although I could of finished the mission anyways but chose to reload instead. I carefully crafted my own experience by making sure my Star Wolves were the very best in the galaxy and won't be subject to anything less.\nAt the time of my original review, I was complacent being acclimated to the steady learning curve. Then, 3rd tier ships arrived and my gameplay was evolved exponentially. This respect is utterly pure and almost a forgotten art in media nowadays.\nThe cast of characters become family not through conversing but by manipulating them to do whats got to be done for your mission and the sake of your choices that matter throughout the game. Does a doctor know you any better after he performs surgery upon you? Well, kind of because he/she has seen parts of you that nobody else has. Guidance is the virtue that strengthens the cooperation and this is customizable by the passive abilities afforded to the player which is shared by the whole team. Don't expect any love stories or childish affection these are the consumate proffessionals, the main protagonist whom you name at the start, rarely says a peep the entire game, but I guarantee that you know him the best by the end as he is what Star Wolves is all about, strong, silent, calculating LEADER.\nThere is too much to say. The music is a driving force as it gets more intense the further you play. The soundtrack is the real star of the show. Thats is the player too as it seems that each instrument is a teammate, when you get your last member he is the scientist/computer hacker, the techno parts of songs really makes more sense. The game is art. Edge of your cockpit ART!","March 16","true","40.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","0"

The visual appearance is that of about 5fps despite the fact that it's actually well over 100fps.  Inputs also act stuttery, so it's impossbile to control the game (difficult to even navigate the menus it's so bad), and visually it makes you ill very fast.  Best guess at this time is it simply can't deal with newer hardware.  It's not OS based, compatibility mode doesn't help.  Plenty of people report it runs fine under Win 7 systems, but a lot of people are seeing this issue recently which lends to the hardware conclusion.  If you have an older rig it may work fine.","January 3, 2015","false","0.3"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","0"

Freespace 2 or Freelancer still looks pretty nice even now.\n\nThis first game is mission based, so you choose mission and do it, and progress to next mission if available, but the next missions are more open world ala the afromentioned baldur gate. But the core gameplay is similar. You might want to check this one first because it's simpler, then check Star Wolves 3 if you want to try the gameplay in open world.\n\nJust don't play Star Wolves 2, dunno now, but back then when it originally came out it was so bad it literally broke my computer.","September 16, 2015","true","24.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
