This was my first game I ever owned back when I was a child, so I have a nostalgic bias. To the review; this game from the get-go is aesthetically 200% better. It looks like any indie FPS you can buy nowadays minus a tutorial and immediate plot. I put countless hours into this game as a child and never beat it. That was back before there was internet walkthroughs and developers who thought that you (the gamer) barely passed the second grade. I recommend this game to anyone who wants an relaxing, in-depth story told to them through puzzles, journal entries, and a non-hostile environment.\n\nGood things to say about this game:\n-Beautiful\n-Flashlight feature is helpful\n-Easy conversion from classic point-'n'-click to real-time first person.\n-Story remains intact if not more immerse\n-More brainpower and problem-solving required than any game on the modern market\n\nBad things to say about this game:\n-Suffers from massive framerate drops in real time first person. I drop from 60+ FPS to around 15-20 frequently; it's not a hardware issue either, it's a frame cap.\n-First person controls are different and take some getting use to (Letting off WASD brings up a cursor)\n-Not a casual adventure game; requires hours upon hours to reveal the entire story, get through each puzzle (if you're new to the game), and navigate each area.\n\nThis is a time-consuming masterpiece. Mozart is to the Classical genre of music, as Myst is to Adventure games. Very few games deserve such artistic praise, this ranks number 1 on my list.","February 5, 2014","true","3.0"," 349 of 367 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","349","367","0","10"

I, however, have just played it for the first time (RealMyst Masterpiece, not the original). It has a lot of good points, but I gotta tell ya, there were some major gameplay issues that had me tearing my hair out at times. I'm sure some of that comes from trying to optimize an old game for new systems, but I was hoping for better. Still, I really enjoyed it and I'm glad I played it.\n\nGOOD POINTS (as determined by a newbie to the series):\n- Like everyone else has said, it's visually beautiful and imaginative.\n- Soundtrack is lovely and very atmospheric.\n- It was nice to know through the in-game "Hints" menu (which, yes, I had to check, for reasons described below) that this was a non-hostile environment! No waiting for something evil to jump out at me from the shadows, even though there are a few ominous things to see/hear. But nothing explicit - still family-friendly, I would say.\n- The puzzles are truly creative, and that kept me interested. Every Age has a specific "theme" or "conceit" for how its puzzles work, but knowing the "theme" don't make 'em easy! As someone who grew up playing online Flash room escape games (and some point-and-click adventure games like The Neverhood), I was really impressed with the varied methods you had to use to solve them. Pro tip: don't try playing with the sound off. Ask me how I found that out. (Plus you'll miss the music and audio messages!)\n- The story (which is why I play games) was tantalizing and left me wanting more.\n- Having 2 options for navigation controls was handy.\n- The day/night cycles for each age were cool and added to the immersive aspect.\n- The flashlight was a HUGE help! I mean, you could probably get by without it,  but I found it indispensable. I hate not knowing if I'm missing something because I'm in a dark area!\n- The live acting wasn't half bad.\n- Unfortunately, after finishing it, there isn't really anything "to do" in the different Ages, but I liked that you're able to go back and explore more if you want.\n\nTHINGS I DISLIKED:\n- Oh. My. Gosh. The "clicking" mechanics absolutely drove me UP THE WALL! I usually had to click on a certain supposed-to-be-clickable area in 20 different places before it would work. And the "sweet spots," when I finally found them, were inconsistent.\n- The other "clicking" problem was that I frequently would stop being able to click on anything all of a sudden. I'd try to click a button that I'd pressed a hundred times and nothing would happen, and then I'd discover I couldn't click anything else either (though the game didn't freeze). I usually had to reload a save, which was frustrating, although on rare occasions the problem went away after I visited the game menu and waited a few minutes. Still, VERY exasperating. I was never able to tell, the first time I tried to click on a new object, if it was truly clickable or if I was having another glitch. I had to resort to the Hints frequently just because of that.\n- Sometimes I would get "stuck" navigationally: I wouldn't be able to leave/move away from a particular position or vantage point, though there was nothing obstructing me. Sometimes I could fix it by reloading, but sometimes I had to work my way back from an earlier save :/ I particularly had this problem while facing the battery in the Stoneship Age and while facing the ceiling above the elevator in the Mechanical Age.\n- The game did crash on me - once, I think.\n- There are certain times when you're supposed to be able to hear an audio message, but the music never muted or decreased its volume, so I could rarely hear what was said. I had to look up the transcripts online. Subtitles would've been a huge help.\n- I had an issue with the red/blue pages where I could collect them both in each Age, but could only give away the one that I had collected last. This meant that I didn't get to hear some of the audio messages from the brothers.\n- You kind of have to do the Selenitic Age first, though the game doesn't require you to (and I didn't). Certain puzzles in other Ages are extremely hard to beat without having been introduced to a particular puzzle from the Selenitic.\n- Having only five available save-game slots was annoying to someone who's used to infinite saves :D Also, some of the saves actually took me back a little ways before where the save-point actually was - I couldn't really save while a puzzle was in progress.\n\nIn short, it's a great game, and it's fun to get to experience the great-granddaddy of all the point-and-click games I grew up with. That said, you definitely need to approach it with the knowledge that it's still an old game, despite its remastering. It has plenty of major bugs, but it's still good. I liked it enough that if they remade Riven and etc. I'd probably play them.","October 4, 2014","true","9.9"," 133 of 140 people (95%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","95","133","140","6","3"

While the graphics and sounds are completely revamped to match modern-day standards, the gameplay stays true to its original and does not fail to deliver the nostalgic Myst-feeling.\n\nIt is, admittingly, a rather peculiar game, a slow paced and thoughtful puzzler in a surrealistic setting. Its puzzles can be overwhelming at times, especially for those unfamiliar with the genre, but they always have a logical (sometimes surprisingly straightforward) solution that makes you feel really smart if you solve them on your own. But even for those non-hardcore adventure gamers among you, the game offers a built in (optional) hint system that gives you little advices without spoiling too much.\n\nThere are only few negative points that should be mentioned; The controls and movement feel a bit wonky at times and you might occasionally get stuck on objects on the ground (nothing game-breaking though), however Cyan is working on a fix for that at the point of this review. The in-game cinematics still have the low resolution from previous renditions of Myst, which seems a bit out of place considering the otherwise beautiful graphics. And the missing inventory (you can only pick up and carry one item at a time) is a rather annoying remnant from the original Myst game, often requiring an unnecessary amount of backtracking.\n\nIn summary, realMyst: Masterpiece Edition is a game that wants you to immerse yourself, absorb the scenery and use your logical thinking. If you are a fan of the Myst series to begin with, this is almost a must-have, but any other adventure fan might take a look at this as well, to get a chance to enjoy a game that wrote history in a new and stunning visual design.","January 7, 2015","true","12.9"," 68 of 73 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","68","73","0","1"

The 3D work in the 'common' areas is really nice, but in other areas it feels very crude.  For example the ending of the maze, you can see the textures tiling as you go by.  Same on the fortress.  They also did not remake the videos, especially the 'bad' endings.\n\nA bit choppy on max settings with a very strong gaming machine.  Definitely not warranted for the quality being rendered, but it didn't really affect the gameplay.  Effects that seem to be from the engine (ie. water/lava) look really good.\n\nI played it through and only had a single crash while alt tabbing to check e-mail.\n\nThe 3D controls were pretty good, if a bit awkward at first.  Going up and down a spiral staircase in a certain realm was actually rather odd.  Moving around in 3D does, imho, make the game easier as things are much easier to find and figure out than in the traditional navigation.\n\nI also found a typo in one of the journals.  The journals are worth reading, as a kid playing the game I didn't really read for the story, just the clues and missed the whole plot and meaning of the red/blue books.\n\nThe 'final' realm is also a bit dependent on your audible skills.  I am a bit tone deaf, which made that realm a challenge.  *You definitely need sound to finish that portion of the game.*\n\nOverall, having had played the original Myst many years (decades?) ago, this was an enjoyable second play through.","February 5, 2014","true","5.6"," 65 of 73 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","65","73","0","0"

We got Myst so I could experience it the way he did but it crashed whenever we solved the clock tower puzzle to get to the Mechanical Age, so we got this. We have completed all but the Channelwood Age and I have to say, I'm really impressed with it. It's not the most well optimized game, but it runs fine most of the time. (Seriously, it looks good not amazing. I can run Shadow of Mordor on high and this lags. What?) I still can't it was done by 2 guys. The atmosphere is surreal and the music, oh my god, the music. The puzzles are really clever and most of them are difficult, but solveable. (I say most. I'm looking at you Spaceship Piano). The answers are usually in plain sight, you just have to explore and have the thinking capacity to connect two seemingly unrelated things. I also like how each age has a 'theme'. The flashlight was a godsend, as you may as well be blind during the night. You can't see ANYTHING at night time, so that helped a lot.

It was rough around the edges, the view distance was a little short, but it maintained Myst's atmosphere, and gave you the bonus of being fully present in the world.\n\nRealMyst Masterpiece is not that. This is a port to the Unity engine, along with all the baggage of modern graphical realism. Bloom, motion blur, specular textures, all the things that make games look "real", utterly fail in this edition. The architecture of Myst no longer has that surreal appeal in the original slideshow or Plasma engine versions, but rather a horrible out of place look. There are points in RealMyst Masterpiece where iconic structures look like the worst examples of bad-CGI-inserted-into-live-action-film you can imagine. Gone is the sense that this is a real place you can let your brain fill in the blanks for; instead Unity brings all the trappings of photorealism, and ruins the look entirely. The remaining prerendered videos (the red/blue/green books, Atrus) are the same as they were in RealMyst, and their encoding artifacts stick out even more under Unity's shiny patina.\n\nPick up the original RealMyst, it still works fine on modern OSes. Support Cyan by purchasing Myst, or Riven, or Uru, or donate to Myst Online, or throw your hat in for Obduction. But don't let them feel this slapdash engine port was a good idea.","June 4, 2015","false","4.4"," 80 of 103 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","80","103","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/twitcheaglehart/recommended/244430/","twitcheaglehart","Twitch","http://steamcommunity.com/id/twitcheaglehart/","112 products in account","Vanilla Myst had two major issues, and with this game one of them has been fixed.\nThe first issue is the nature of the puzzles themselves. Although they are deliciously challenging at times, there is quite a bit of 'find solution, write down solution, walk across map, apply solution'. This will never be fixed, but it certainly doesn't make the game anything less than spectacular.\n\nThe other issue, and by far the most severe issue, was how old the damn game was. Assuming you could even get it to start, you had to find a legacy version of Quicktime and were playing the game in 320x240 which some monitors don't even support anymore. A side effect of it's age was the graphics quality being garbage. Usually I can overlook graphics in a well-crafted game, but when a game relies so heavily on immersion and observation, and is prerendered with zero fluidity of movement, having visuals as poor as Myst's simply detracts from the overall experience.\n\nIt is for these two reasons that I had trouble getting people into the Myst series. Riven, which is quite possibly the greatest game of all time, relies on players having experienced Myst's universe and story. So you were left with two choices: Wrestle Myst into submission and persuade yourself to beat it, where the only redeeming factor at this point is it's imperfect puzzles, or play the also-ugly and also-buggy realMyst.\n\nWith the release of realMyst Masterpiece, I can finally say that Myst is fixed. While the graphics aren't quite perfect, and there are still a few cosmetic bugs, and the puzzles are the same puzzles as ever, I feel like this game actually deserves to be Riven's prequel.\n\nIn short, there is no longer any reason why you should not play through realMyst Masterpiece and then play Riven.","April 25, 2014","true","82.2"," 40 of 42 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","40","42","0","0"

Very nice touch.\n\nI never got into realMyst in order to see the additional content, so I'm glad that they made it worth exploring all over again in order to get to the new content.\n\nThe textures are also much, much better than in realMyst.

In other words, don't expect there to be a huge amount amount of gameplay here. If you buckle down, you can beat this game in one sitting. That's not to say that there's no challenge to it as there certainly can be at times.\n\nFor the most part, you're playing to find out about the unfolding story. This game used to be a point and click adventure. It seems to have upgraded to being a free roam First-Person which can ultimately betray any new comers to the game leading you to believe there's more to the puzzle than what there really is. You can now roam in unchecked corners and behind bookshelves which you could never do in the first place so if you're stumped on a puzzle, it's best not to start checking every nook and cranny. To be safe, they've added a feature so that you can use the point and click system which at times can be pretty difficult to use since there's multiple things to click on so you have to be pretty precise about what you want to inspect.\n\nThe puzzles themselves aren't terribly difficult although a couple of times I will admit I was so stumped I had to use the hint system and in those cases, I feel that you have to have had accidentally stumbled upon the answer rather than using your own intellect as there is no clue to how that could've been solved. Also there seems to be a number of objects you can interact with that add no value to the gameplay or story itself. I have to imagine these were added in simply for the novelty back then but today, they're unnecessary and merely serve to distract.\n\nThe story tries its best to layout a path for you to follow, but it doesn't seem to matter in the end which order you decide to do the levels in just so long as you bring back something important from each level. In the end, the story sort of leaves you hanging. It has a resolve, but leaves you with "come back for the sequel if you want the whole story." Not to mention a lot of the writing within the game details a lot more history to the Island, yet none of those elements are anywhere to be found or mentioned ever again and it's hard to imagine everything that's being described happening in such a small place since the levels themselves are fairly small with not a lot of scenery to back up the writings.\n\nThis game definitely has it's own charm though and I would recommend it. It's pretty unique and as long as you can get past the first couple puzzles, you'll probably have no problem finishing the game. Except the tram part. That part sucks.","September 11, 2015","true","17.4"," 37 of 41 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","37","41","2","3"

Myst Island has never looked so beautiful before, full of more lush vegetation and gorgeous water. The heights on Channelwood, the eerie blasted landscape of Selenitic, are beautifully rendered in the new engine. I've spent time just walking around admiring the improvements in some of my favorite video game locations of all time.\n\nThe puzzles all have an internal logic, focused on you understand what the environment is telling you. The key to solving the puzzles of Myst is to remember that everything on the island and Ages were created and reshaped by people, and the traces of their presence they leave behind gives insights to their past actions, their outlook on the world, and what they might yet do. What someone displays in their room is important, as is what they conceal and how they do so. The story is meant to be uncovered via exploration and careful reading, of putting together what it means that a symbol from one Age is repeated in a more sinister context elsewhere.

I must say I like the fact that 20 years after initial release of Myst, we can play it again as a new, fresh game (kind of). But can we call it a good, modern game, up to today's standards? Let's find out.\nNotably, realMyst from 2004 got rather low ratings, so let's also compare the Masterpiece Edition with its predecessor.\n\nWhen you look at the Myst Island, first impression is very good. Textures have been updated. Water looks great, which makes for amazing landscapes, not only on Myst. When you go into other Ages, however, they seem much less polished.\nProbably the worst thing are in-game videos, which are very low-res (they are just the old ones). Models are also dated, prepare to see lots of simple polyhedrons - probably that's why the game's description only mentiones updated textures. But, well, you'll also find low-res textures.\nAll that is to say - realMyst: ME is still an old, refreshed game, not a completely new one. It doesn't look bad, I enjoyed the views, but don't expect miracles. Also, lack of edge smoothing is disturbing.\n\nI dare to say, there are no new games like Myst. People spent a lot of time here, trying to figure out how stuff works. It could be fascinating in the 90s to explore the Ages for months (I wish I was playing back then). Nowadays people just want quick gameplays. Frustration could be a source of realMyst's low ratings.\nIn this edition, some puzzles got much easier. Hard to say if it's good - they say almost nobody completed the original Myst. So maybe now people will have a chance. (Wish I didn't look at spoilers so early playing Myst for the first time, duh!) For those who know the game well (spoiler alert):\nScheme showing how to turn fortress in Mechanical is now in the journal on Myst. Receivers in Selenitic are much easier to set now, and they only have to be set roughly.\n\nFinally, what stands between us and the Myst Ages: the interface. People were saying that realMyst's 3D environment made stuff just more annyoing. The solution came in this edition - we can now choose Free Roam mode, or classic point-and-click. I must say, clicking to walk in 3D is annoying for me, so I went free. Controls are not perfect, but I got used to them after a while.\n\nOverally, realMyst: Masterpiece Edition is not a miracle, but definitely worth playing. If you don't know Myst yet, this edition is great for finding out what's so special about the old bestseller. If you've already been there, this visit will certainly be great.\nAnd if such a game would be released now as a new title, without its predecessors... Nah, that couldn't happen. Nobody makes such games nowadays. Maybe that's why I love Myst so much.","January 2, 2015","true","7.4"," 32 of 35 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","32","35","3","3"

It's actually done suprisingly well and stays true to the original through-out, even including the original scenes that had used real actors. I did find the performance a little choppy in some sections but never to a point where the game was unplayable. The new graphics engine brings a new life to Myst, while my elitist self prefers the original, this looks absolutely amazing and they pretty much nailed the aesthetics of the original re-imagined in 3D.\n\nMyst is the first entry into the series and gave birth to one of the most incredible puzzle/adventure games of all time, it has some really clever puzzles that will tap into parts of your brain that are covered with cobwebs and will force you to think not 'outside the box' but 'without the box'. The plot is one extremely immersive trip that you have to uncover yourself and there are a few Myst novels that go into it with a lot more detail.\n\nMyst starts you off glaring at a book with a moving image of an island which sends you to the island, Myst, upon interaction with it and thats where this mind numbingly fascinating adventure begins. You soon discover that there are two books placed in a library and with exploration and interactions you discover that there are two people trapped inside them, one within each book. You'll need to collect pages of the two books to free them, which are scattered around the 'Ages' (different worlds within the game) and you'll need to solve a series of complicated, yet extremely logical puzzles to progress through these diverse and unique worlds in order to find the pages and uncover more of the plot.\n\nMyst features some amazingly designed puzzles, you'll need to write down notes, memorize figures, find clues and memorize sounds to solve them, the levels are abstract and beautiful, each completely different from the last and you'll be able to explore and solve puzzles in which ever order of world you please. This is trully an amazing adventure which has been brought back from obscurity by Cyan and would recommend anyone interested in puzzle games or interested in trying something different to invest in it.","February 13, 2015","true","17.2"," 34 of 41 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","34","41","0","0"

I was terrified that at any second I was going to be attacked by some unknown foe.\n\n2. I was absolutely enthralled with how good the game was.\n\nNow, I didn't beat the game until I was probably 9 or 10 because it was difficult at that age, but ever since then I've revisited it from time to time. I've played the original, Masterpiece Edition, and now realMyst: ME. I love that it now runs properly on Windows 8 and it fills my screen.

I wish they could have remastered the sound a bit better, as that alone was one of the best parts of Myst.\n\nAll in all, I'm happy I bought it, but then I've played every game in the series. If you weren't a huge fan of the original, then it's probably not for you, but if you somehow have never played Myst, this is a must-buy, as you can't call yourself a gamer if you've never played (and beaten it without guides!)

Noting this is the primary reason for my "review."\n\nOverall, this version seems to be faithful to the original, quite attractive, and definitely worth it for anyone who has "the itch" but doesn't have any version besides the original. There's an inexplicable lack of rebindable hotkeys and the anti-aliasing isn't the best, but for the most part the rough edges contribute to the "old school" feel.\n\nFair warning, though: there are also a few dumb glitches, particularly with the "free roam" mode. None are show-stoppers, and they seem to be the sort of thing you need a certain number of unique testers to catch. For example, an elevator in the tree age reset after loading a save wherein I was on the second level of platforms. I was able to safely fall through the hole where the elevator should have been, and the game "snapped" me onto the platform without incident.

It's the sort of game that just drops you into a strange new world without any explanation, and lets you figure out how its various mechanisms work on your own. This version is an enhanced version of the original realMyst, which itself was a 3D remake of the original Myst, allowing you to walk around like a standard first-person game instead of being locked into the usual 360 swivel-cam. The Masterpiece edition greatly improves the graphics, but at the expense of having pretty strange performance; despite my GTX 970 and overclocked i5, I barely managed 30 fps when the preset was set to Very High, but when setting the preset to Medium High (turning it to anything lower than that decreases the mouse speed, for some reason) and turning on all of the settings in the Advanced options it ran at around 70 to 100+ depending on the area. The ability to move freely increases immersion, but also makes the puzzles a bit more difficult in my opinion by making it less obvious what you can and can't interact with, which is further increased by the better graphics of this version, but I consider that to be more of a plus. realMyst might not be the version of the game that the original developer prefers, but it's the one I'd rather play.","February 2","true","7.6"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","16","18","0","3"

My first thoughts upon first walking onto the new Myst Island in full 3D motion was a single word - "Wow". Granted, the graphics here aren't perfect either, and there's a lot of improvement that needs to be done - but from the original point-and-click classic to this is a huge leap forward. Simply breathtaking work has been done on this!\n\nOn the game itself... Myst was considered the game that really cinched the idea of CD-ROM drives in computers. If it weren't for this classic game by Cyan (now Cyan Worlds), the concept of computer gaming might not have caught on as readily as it has. Myst sets the standard for point and click adventure puzzle games, and many of the puzzle adventure games we have today owe a great deal to it. It is a great puzzle game with tough challenges that will make you think in different ways, from spatial relations to simple addition, logical leaps to sound-based puzzles and even a maze or two. Despite its difficulty and brain-teasing nature, Myst greatly rewards exploration, not with pickups or special items, but with amazing graphical design and a relaxing atmosphere that makes the game ideal for playing as a way to unwind after a long, stressful day. I could literally watch the sun rise and set over Myst Island for hours, or listen to the frogsong in Channelwood for ages (pun not intended). The story is simple - a great wrong has happened in the family of a man named Atrus, and his two sons Sirrus and Achenar are the only sources you have on the issue. Atrus himself is AWOL, and the brothers refuse to speak to you unless you bring them pages for the books they are trapped in - and so begins the journey into a tale of intrigue, injustice, and a terrible secret...\n\nThat said, this game is not for everyone. Those that are not fans of Hunt-The-Pixel puzzles or puzzle games in general will not find much to like here. Those who prefer action are not going to find it here. Those who have no interest in taking the time to apreciate the beauty of little details are not going to enjoy this game. But for those of you who like a good mental challenge, enjoy taking your time, and love puzzle games, this is a must-have. Seriously, every puzzle or point-and-click fan out there OWES it to themselves to obtain either this copy of the game or another copy of realMYST. Just start it up, put on some headphones, and immerse yourself in the beauty of the game's worlds. Newcomers to the series will find a lot to enjoy here - and old friends will find it a wonderful welcome back.","June 19, 2015","true","4.5"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","0"

A lot of this will be similar to a review for realMyst's original release.\n\nThis is just as awkward to control as realMyst was, and having to move the mouse to slide a Marker Switch up and down or move the flow controls in Channelwood from side to side is not an easy experience if you are using free movement.\n\nThis game uses the same movie files from realMyst (the brothers' library videos are the same as the original release, other videos are newer and less-well-acted). Myst: Masterpiece Edition runs like garbage on modern systems--if it runs at all--but at least when you play that you believe that Atrus believes what he's saying and isn't just reciting old dialogue.\n\nHaving the original gameplay images for Myst pop up when you press Shift (while not using free movement) is a nice touch, though if you are running this on a modern resolution you'll barely be able to see the images in the center of your screen.\n\nThe sound is as great as it ever was, although just like with realMyst, this version of the game does not completely mute the music at appropriate times (as in the fore-chamber).The music itself is not changed from classic Myst and that's a huge point in this release's favor.\n\nI guess there's a flashlight now but having just finished the game I never used it. Not sure what the point of it is unless you're too lazy to turn the crank on the battery in Stoneship. I can't think of any other locations that are very dark and also have something worth seeing. I don't even know what button it is bound to. Probably F.\n\nAt the end of the day, this is still Myst, and one of the first games to tell a deep story purely by observations of one's environment (Gone Home also does this very well). Modern systems don't have many other ways to play other releases of Myst without jumping through compatibility hoops so having this on Steam is cool---BUT the original release is on iOS in untouched, fully compatible glory.\n\nIf you own realMyst, this game is 12 bucks instead of 18.

Developer Cyan has stated that they are still in testing and will update further whe they are ready for general public.  The game has classic point and click controls as well as wasd/mouse first person controls.  I personally used the classic controls and instead of shifting panes like it used to do many years ago, now you get a nice walking simulation to the next area of interest. This walk movement simulation can also be scaled faster or slower.  In classic Myst fashion the game is extremely hard with puzzles that stretch across the environments. You have to use memory, sounds, and quickness to complete many puzzles in this fantastic setting.  If you are looking for a new challenge or haven't visited the original myst since the 90's you will be in for a treat with some of the toughest puzzles in any adventure game.","June 28, 2014","true","12.6"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","1"

That being said the game includes a VERY good guide that can break down tasks for you without giving the answer away. It gives the option of giving you little hints, and you can request more all the way up to them giving you the flat out answer if you get tired of it. This allows for puzzle-solving on all levels and gives anyone a chance.\n\nI didn't want to flat out bash this game without mentioning the parts they did do well. However, the game mechanics can be very hindering and not smooth. So much to the point that if you are under a structure (such as a stairwell), and the game glitches you will find yourself stuck there and without frequent saving you are fuc*d. This happened to me and caused me a lot of stress. I only save when im done playing due to the fact that you cannot die in this game since it is solely puzzle-solving.

It helped shape the future of adventure games, and became the definitive PC game of the early to mid '90s, only being outsold by the Sims as late as 2002.  Myst is a timeless tale of a mysterious island filled with books that transport you to new and fantastic locales.  Ever played a game where you point and click through different scenes?  Myst probably inspired it.\n\nIt wasn't until the last few years or so before I realized just how much Myst really affected me as a gamer.  I believe that everyone's gamer identity is in part defined by the games you are first exposed to.  So it makes sense to me why I have such a love of atmosphere and immersion, because Myst had that in spades.  There's nothing quite like standing on the shores of the island, listening to the wind and the waves.\n\nThe game is primarily puzzle based, and that's where most people take issue with Myst.  The puzzles are often complicated and convuluted.  This remake edition solves some of it, but there's still a lot of head scratching.  Myst operates by its own set of rules that you have to figure out as you go along.  The game doesn't have a tutorial, or a compass, or anything telling you where to go or what to do (although this edition comes with a hint guide in case you're truly lost).  It is really a game about exploration and discovery.  And believe me, solving a puzzle on your own is a fantastic sensation.\n\nrealMyst: Masterpiece Edition may be a little pricey at nearly twenty bucks, but it all depends on your viewpoint.  For me, it was worth it.  For some just coming into the series, it might seem a little like price gouging.  But if you're interested, I highly recommend checking out this standout title from gaming's youth.  This new edition enhances the graphics and includes the free form movement from the original realMyst, making it (in my opinion) the definitive edition of Myst.  So whether you're just an old fan looking for a trip down nostalgia lane, or a new arrival, Myst welcomes you to an adventure of mystery.  Because, after all, perhaps the ending has not yet been written.\n\nEDIT: I neglected to mention in my original review that this version of the game is sometimes janky.  It's not optimized very well at times, which might just be due to the Unity engine itself, but I can't be sure.  In any case, it's something you should be aware of if you are thinking of buying it.  I never had slowdown so bad it made the game unplayable, but it did come close in the Selenitic age.  I still consider it the definitive modern edition of the game, but it is certainly not without its faults.","September 21, 2014","true","28.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This was basically the game that made me really like computer games.\n\nFast forward 20+ years and we have this, realMyst, completely rebuilt from the ground up using a modern engine and graphics.  For the first time, you are able to walk around the island and the Ages, able to take in every detal. The only things that were kept from the original Myst were the sound files and the original actor videos. I'm very happy to finally play Myst the way I believe it was meant to be. Not only has this pretty much been a nostalgia trip for me, it also brings Myst to the modern age where high graphics and the "first person" dominates so today's generation can appreciate the game.\n\nI really hope that a Riven version is being worked on, but I can imagine the difficulty in that due to the size of it compared to Myst.\n\nI highly recommend anyone get this, whether you traveled to Myst 20 years ago, or are looking to get into the series now, this is the perfect way to bring yourself into the world of Myst.","April 20, 2014","true","2.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It can be annoying that the player can only hold one page at a time though.\n\nRegarding performance, it actually does run better if you first set it to minimum settings and then to maximum or whatever it is you want to run.

The CD-ROM format was expected to fail by analysts. There was no reason for most consumers to even purchase a CD-ROM Drive. Nearly every computer game was still being published and sold on floppy discs. Consumers NEVER had any files large than a few megabytes to store. Video on computers weren't really a thing. Nobody had digital camers or camcorders. There were no vast amounts of photos to store. Heck, the average hard drive at the time was smaller than a CD-ROM's 700 MB. Usually half that size. There were virtualy no reasons at all why a consumer would ever need a CD reader in their computer, unless they wanted to play music over their PC speakers. And who would want to do that? Most experts expected the CD-ROM to die as a format.\n\nAnd then Myst was released.\n\nLooking back at the original game, it looks primitive. It's barely anything more than a bunch of pictures you click through and interact with to solve puzzles. There were a few videos and the audio was ever present, but that was it.\n\nHowever, at the time, this was amazing. There weren't many games that offered a beautiful first person view like this. Even though the game consisted entirely of pre-rendered pictures, the game really made you feel like you were there. The developers were forced to create wonderful ambient sounds and a deep enthralling theme and story to really suck you in. The game was met by critical reception and acclaim.\n\nAnd it saved the CD-ROM format. After Myst, EVERYONE was releasing their game on CD. It was a truly successful game, even netting it it's own parody game in the form of Pyst, developed by Parrotty Interactive, starring John Goodman.\n\nThe year was 1997.\n\nI was eight years old and my dad had purchase our first computer. I can still remember watching him play. He LOVED the game. I think he spent hours reading the in-game books, pouring over puzzles, and making notes in his little Myst notebook. I grew up playing the original Myst and all of it's remakes. However, it's been around 14 years since I last played the game.\n\nrealMyst: Masterpiece Edition is an excellent modern interpretation of the original realMyst that was an excellent then-modern interpretation of the original Myst. Unfortunately the original realMyst lags horribly on Windows 7 and the other Myst remakes crash a lot, so this is your only bet.\n\nIt's a beautiful game, with all of the original depth, originality, and puzzly goodness of the original Myst and realMyst. Except this games has Anisotropy! And grass!\n\nTruly, the graphics are stunningly beautiful, I can't say that enough. And the day/night cycle really makes the island feel more alive than it did before. Now, if they'd just patch in some weather effects.\n\nHowever, the optimization of the graphics and performance is a bit poor. My laptop is by no means a powerhorse, however I have no problem running Skyrim or GTA IV at medium graphics. realMyst ME doesn't do so well on my computer. Anything mid-range or higher causes my FPS to drop pretty quickly. However, the game is still beautiful and an improvement at the lower settings.\n\nThe story to this game is basic, as it is a product of it's time. There was only so much room on CD-ROMs! Speaking of which, the game is also a bit short. Your hour will vary depending on how clever you are or if you've played Myst before. I, surprisingly, remembered a lot more than I thought I would and I finished the game shortly under ten hours. But your mileage really may vary. It takes a while to really learn what to do when starting out. You have to read the in-game books and really get inside your head a bit to figure it out. Don't rush in and give up on each puzzle after a minute if the solution isn't apparent. Think about what you've seen or read and see where it might fit into the world or on each level.\n\nThis game is a classic and monstrously fun. If you enjoy it, make sure to look out for the Starry Expanse Project who are currently making realRiven, the sequel to Myst. Also, the original Riven is on Steam and doesn't seem to share the compatibility issues the other Myst titles do.\n\nReally, it's not a bad deal for the price, especially if you own the original realMyst, giving you the 33 % discount.

Sadly, the game simply won't run on a modern machine without constantly crashing, and I gave up hope of experiencing the game again. So I was all the more delighted when I found out about realMyst: Masterpiece Edition, which I picked up the day it was quietly released on Steam. I'm glad to say that this game has all the greatness of the original, with the added bonus of better graphics and the inclusion of the original game's artwork.\n\nFor the uninitiated, realMyst is the 3D recreation of the original Myst game, which was released all the way back in 1993. Once an adventure created through still images and small inset videos, the world is fully eplorable and features all the neat things one expects to see in modern 3D game worlds, thanks to the Unity game engine. Added ambient effects include a day/night cycle and weather on Myst and many of the Ages, motion blur, depth of field, and a toggleable flashlight. It's also possible to set the game to jump between all the camera angles from the original game, but transition in 3D between clicks. It's a little bit bumpy at times, but helps strike a good balance between the new graphics and the underlying game of the past.\n\nAll the familiar sound effects and music from the original game are here as well, only in higher fidelity.\n\nI have only minor complaints with realMyst: ME - mostly surrounding disparities between the control mechanics of certain puzzles, but none of which are really worth mentioning here. I also feel like some of the textures and 3D models could have been created at a higher resolution in places, but overall, things look pretty good.\n\nI definitely recommend realMyst: Masterpiece Edition. It's a mostly faithful remake of Myst, and a great way to see the game realized on modern hardware, for fans of the series and newcomers alike.","March 28, 2014","true","5.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

You will have to visit different worlds (or,better said, ages) on the behalf of two brothers, Sirrus and Achenar, who are trapped inside their own books and need your help to be released. To this end, you must collect magic pages that are scattered around the various ages.\nMyst is a pretty non-linear game: you can access every level from Myst in any order you choose (provided you found the way in) and can decide to return to areas you've already explored later. Myst's puzzles remain fair from the most part, with only some rare exceptions. One could argue that the game could have used an inventory system for the pages: you can carry only one page at a time and, should you find another one and pick it up, the previous one will be returned to its own location. The level's design was Myst's strongest suit at the time of its release and is still noticeable to this day. It's worth mentioning however that the tile is rather short, clocking about five or six hours.\nThis updated release introduces full 3D navigation for the whole game's world, updated graphics and a bonus (albeit short) age, Rime. The new controls are comfortable enough, although a little unresponsive during some transictions, and the new models give Myst much more life\n","June 1, 2014","true","4.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

These games have always been about discovery, exploring very well crafted and believable alien worlds, and figuring out how the environments, natural and man-made structures in these worlds work. Learning the backstory and lore of each world also adds a lot to the experience (in the games this is usually done by reading journals). For me, they are a great and relaxing experience of discovery, and I wish there were more games like this.\n\nSo far I've explored Channelwood, Stoneship age and Myst Island, and I believe this game is to date the best representation of the worlds of Myst 1. The game has greatly enhanced textures, lighting, shadows and water compared to the original Real Myst, and the fact that you can move freely and that the worlds are much more dynamic compared to the original Myst adds a lot to the experience. The worlds are now more believable than ever, with great attention to detail: the day/night cycles are amazing to watch, the sky, moon, clouds, lighting, water, dense vegetation, and several nice touches like different elements appearing at night... the flashlight is also a nice touch.\n\nThe main negative aspect of the game for me has already been pointed out by others, and that is the bad performance. The game indeed seems to be poorly optimized, and sometimes it stutters briefly. But it is not so bad as I have everything maxed out at 1920x1200 and in general it runs fairly well on my computer. I seem to get an average of 30fps, which is perfectly playable for this kind of game. I have an i7-2600k@4.4GHz and a GTX 560Ti (I don't know if the game is more cpu bound or gpu bound, and from what I've read others seem to be getting a worse experience).

A patch on February 27 corrected most of these errors, and the game behind them is the same MYST as always.\n\nNow that this game is far more likely to run on your system, the question left is whether or not you should buy this instead of the first RealMYST. I believe it is a matter of preference. RealMYST runs almost perfectly fluid and costs less than half the price of the masterpiece edition.  On the other hand, this modern update boasts new textures, lighting effects and post processing effects that can make the gameworld seem more alive. Despite these improvements, the masterpiece edition's textures are still noticeably bad by modern standards (particularly the leaves on trees). The game still appears to require more resources than one might think necessary to run smoothly.\n\nUltimately I think whether these improvements are worth the cost is a question best left to you. The game is playable now, and I will honor my original statement and recommend it.","February 12, 2014","true","1.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","2"

You feel immersed in the landscape and the different worlds more than ever, however they aren't really up to spec with modern day game graphics.  Still, if you are into the casual point and click mystery/puzzle games then Myst is pretty much the grand-daddy of them all.\n\nThe controls for the 3D Roaming are a bit awkward at first especially if you've played it before.  The good thing though is that there is a Point and Click option that mimics the original while still maintaining the updated graphics.  I would give it a solid 80/100.\n\nSound is great.  Music is great.  Brings back fond memories.\n\nBottom line: for $12.05 or less (Summer Sale) the game is a must buy if you're into these types of games or if you just want to revisit your childhood days of playing the original Myst series.","June 24, 2014","true","11.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The 3D rendering is quite sluggish and lacks smoothness at times, however the 3d side of it does still compliment a gamer who has a lets explore the island mentality. The added Rime Age is brilliant and compliments the game so much that you would swear it was always there and was meant to be. Also found the walkthrough added to be enjoyable, as it allowed me to understand the complexity of some of the puzzles which I failed to fully understand when I first played this as a child. Disappointed that no achievements were added and that no further easter eggs were created for this game, so in some respects it being labelled as a simple cashin is somewhat warranted. Thought the developers could have provided that little bit more for a cult generation of hardcore fans. With that placed aside this version of Myst is clearly the best yet to date.","February 26, 2014","true","15.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Myst is a puzzle game where you play as a character whom we don't know the name of, and we are given virtually no backstory.  But by going to different 'ages' through books and solving puzzles, more and more of the truth is revealed.  I won't give any major plot spoilers for those who want to really want to invest themselves in finding out the story, but for those who want just a bit of backstory, here you go:  The background of your own character is unknown and there is no way of finding out who you are immediately.  You stumble upon a note from a man named Atrus.  Atrus writes "linking books," which are books used to travel between different ages.  Atrus has a wife, Catherine, whom we don't meet, and two sons, Sirrus and Achenar.  Sirrus and Achenar are each trapped in linking books, and they want your help to get out, but there is a catch:  They each say that the other brother is not to be trusted.  They each say that Atrus met a terrible fate at the hands of the other brother.  It is up to the player to uncover the truth.   Overall, this game gets a 10/10 from me, it excells in every single aspect that puzzle games should have.  Everyone will love this game, even though it can be frustrating at times.

Myst is one of the most accessible classics in the point-and-click adventure genre, emphasizing with its sheer simplicity the joy of the exploration and puzzle-solving without ever coming off as overly contrived or campy.  The visuals are striking, the worlds are rich with lore and characterization, the central murder mystery is compelling and subtle, and the puzzles are never so abstruse as to be unsolvable (as Riven, Myst's sequel, sometimes errs).  For those familiar with the Myst games, realMyst: Masterpiece combines the HD graphic quality of Myst: Masterpiece edition with the full 3D world offered by realMyst (including Rime, the extra age, and day/night progression in all the ages), and does so quite successfully.  The game gives you the option whether to play in full 3D (which is pretty well-executed, though it can be glitchy in places), or according to the game's original advance-by-clicking controls, offering hard-core Myst fans an experience more true to the original game.  The visuals are updated across the board, and many nice touches have been included in this edition that enhance (in my opinion) the Myst experience.  In short, this is the new Gold Standard for Myst, and I highly recommend the game to everyone: gamers, non-gamers, and Myst fans alike.","May 7, 2014","true","6.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Going from what I've played so far (Selenitic Age and part of Channelwood Age) a large proportion of the puzzle solving simply seems to be the grunt work of walking around to get to levers and switches that need turning off/on with the actual working out of the puzzles taking less of the effort. So, having walked around a lot and been unavoidably beeped at by one puzzle over thirty times (urgh!) I don't really know that I want to go on.\n\nThe controls aren't anything to write home about either. For moving around you have the choice of either Classic Myst or Free Roam modes. Classic Myst just means moving around on rails and clicking to either move forward or turn, and it just felt clunky and restrictive and didn't always go where I wanted it to. As for Free Roam, well, as on the tin it's a lot more freeing and you can move around a lot more smoothly, but it's also a bit harder to interact with the environment and I'd often find myself trying to flick a switch from just a little too far away and having to readjust my distance and try again.\n\nNever mind that I've already had the game glitch on me once already switching between the two modes!\n\n...\n\nAnd now I have a great nostalgic urge to find a copy of Zork: Grand Inquisitor (which I would recommend playing instead) so I can wash the taste of this clunky game and it's clunky interface out of my brain, but that might just be the boredom and exasperation talking.\n\n\nEDIT: Well, I managed to finish it... and I guess I'm mostly ambivalent. It does probably have a nice feel in places, but I found the controls a bit lacking; the puzzles solving to be about 90% drudgery and about 10% thinking (some of them you can even solve almost by accident); some of the sound effects to be a little grating; and the hammed up poor quality FMV acting to be a bit underwhelming and jarring.\n\nAs a puzzle game (and I guess as a game in general) I'd probably fail it, and I don't know that it's worth the asking price, but maybe you can just enjoy wandering around the levels? If not there are plenty of free 'room escape' type games online or you could pick up a copy of 'Zork: Grand Inquisitor' or 'The Room' instead and get better value for money.","April 21, 2015","false","11.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I was looking at the settings and said "Wow, at least they seem to have an invert mouse option". And it gets even more crazy. The Invert option is only for traditional look (Wat?!) not for FPS controls. And when I put it, it automatically inverts both Y and X (Wtf?). It's two times impractical, I mean not only the FPS control is the one that should have invert, but just Invert Y not also X. Was the person who designed the controls drunk? It totally doesn't make sense. Even the options menu, minor, but the "X" at the left, intuitively I think it should be to escape from menu, not quit game. It's totally random and fail. Thank god it's just an adventure game, not needing crazy refleces and might try to play again, to see if I can finish Myst this time (I never liked the originals, never understood the dull world, random levers that you don't know what they do, and I do play traditional adventures.

It's got great HD textures and Camera mobility. You can use the classic Myst point and click option. Also, you can use the Free Roam mode, just like in realMyst. The game is pretty much the same as far as story mode goes, including adding Rime from realMyst. However, I was slighty disappointed when I had to do only 1 puzzle to unlock Rime and do 2 puzzles in that age. The real question is, "Should I buy it?". This is only a good purchase, if you're a big fan of the Myst series or you want to experience a more High Definition look to realMyst. Cyan, Inc. are making a new game called Obduction, which was a Kickstarter game that they sucessfully funded just a few months ago. I'm assuming that all the purchases from this game will be put towards that game. Overall, this game is not really worth the buy. If you want a more high playing performance and great graphics gameplay from realMyst, then I would suggest on buying it to help support Cyan, Inc and add it to your collection of Myst games.","February 14, 2014","false","15.9"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","0"

The traditional WSAD-style controls have also been altered so that left and right are pan controls rather than strafe options. This makes the game pretty much unplayable.\n\nI honestly cannot understand how such monumental design errors can make it out into the public's hands without someone somewhere in the process saying "hang on a minute here, this is now a totally different control scheme from just about every single first-person game on PC that's ever been released, maybe we should stick to the norm?".

Cyan paid no attention to the game's compatibility with Surface but judging from the sales of Surface Pro 2, they will have to pay attention in the future.  A waste of money for now (and it is terrible that STEAM does not give refunds), but hopefully Cyan will have another update.

Cyan did a fantastic job with this remake of the realmyst game from 2001 or so. If you love myst then you should fall in love with this version.\n\nSummary:\nIn Myst you play an unknown traveller that finds a book somewhere (you don't find this out until you read the Myst novel's.)  Once you open its cover, you are transported to Myst Island.  Once there, the player discovers the lore of the D'ni and how they created links to worlds that already existed in other dimensions through the use of "The Art."\n\nThe Art is a way of creating linking books to other worlds.  You, the player, are in one of those worlds.  Myst Island is a refuge for Atrus and his family.  Through reading the books in the Myst library, you discover everything about Atrus' sons and gain some insight into his travels in other worlds.\n\nin Myst, you must solve a way to get back to your world.  From reading certain notes spread thoughout the island and in other worlds, you discover a plot to imprison Atrus and leave him for dead by his wicked sons, Sirrus and Achenar.\n\nConclusion:\nFor its day, Myst was an amazing game and truly the first of its kind on CD-ROM.  Each indidual screen was created on a mac and each time the player clicked forward, they would move to the next pre-rendered screen.  Now, you can move all around freely.  realMyst ME is the definitive edition for the original Myst game.\n\nKeep an eye out for the starry expanse project too.  It's a small dev team remaking RIven in Unreal 4.  Riven is the sequel to Myst.  If you've never tried it, at least play the original Riven.  You will feel immersed in both games because there is just so much lore to be found in both.","February 5, 2014","true","15.5"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

I was hoping this could be the version of Myst that I would repeatedly come back to and replace the unstable original Masterpiece edition as my favorite, and while this is a good version of Myst. The original Masterpiece Edition still is and will continue to be my favorite version.","November 4, 2014","false","1.2"," 4 of 14 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","4","14","0","0"

Where to start. I'm going to approach this in chronological order of my\n\nthorough dissapointment with this title. My first wave of frustration eminated\n\nfrom the lack of an options menu right at the beginning. I like to set my\n\nresolution at least before starting a new game, so I had to watch the nice intro in\n\nan eye wrenching 1280x720, which was a little annoying but overall not a huge\n\ndeal. After spawning in the world a menu comes up and tells you that you have a\n\nchoice between free roam and and classic mode, awesome. Naturally, I pick free\n\nroam, because nostalgia's great and everything but classic mode really defeats the\n\npurpose of playing a real time version of Myst. Walking around in free roam was\n\nterribly confusing at first and didnt seem to make any sense, but what I figured\n\nout is that if you're standing still you have to hold down the right mouse button\n\nto look. But you can look freely without doing that while moving. This is a\n\nterribly unintuitive control mechanic that makes free roam into a kind of mental\n\ngymnastic constantly trying to remember to hold down the mouse button every\n\ntime you stop for half a second. It is the most pointlessy alien and baffling first\n\nperson mechanic I've ever played. It's like Cyan has been sealed away in a glass\n\ndome for the last 20 years and essentially invented their own control mechanic\n\nbased on what they knew from developing the orginal Myst and didnt bother at all\n\nto take an example from literally any other well designed first person game. It's\n\nalso worth noting that when holding down the right mouse button, not only is it\n\nuncomfortable to hold it down while moving the mouse, the sensitivity is\n\ninexplicably lower which adds a new variable of unnessecary awkwardness into\n\nthis madman's equation. In line with my frustration with the controls is the fact\n\nthat there seems to be mouse acceleration that cant be disabled. I personally view\n\nmouse acceleration with the same burning hostility that I would normally reserve\n\nfor someone who had just burned my house down and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ on my dog. And I\n\ncan't be the only one who feels this way so it would be nice to have a little\n\ncheckbox or something like all of the FPS's ever that have a mouse-acceleration\n\nfeature. You know, just a thought. Now, that that's out of the way let's talk about\n\nthe engine. I've never been overly impressed with the Unity engine, and personally\n\nwould not choose to develop in it myself, but I really want to believe it can be\n\nused more efficiently than this. The fan for my decent graphics card that can run\n\nCrysis 2 with no real problems was screaming at full speed after about 2 minutes.\n\nI don't know if Cyan develops their real time titles in house but theyve never\n\nseemed to reflect a firm grasp on how to develop assets for a games engine.\n\nTheyve always seemed to approach it with the same technique you would use for\n\nproduction rendering, in the 90's no less, going completely off the chain with\n\ntexel density and poly count for example, yet making no use of masking or\n\nlayering or anything of the sort that a modern node based shader editor can do to\n\nhide atrociously tiling textures. Foliage density is unneseccarily higher than a\n\ncrack head fresh out of rehab, and I noticed a couple instances of vertex normals\n\nbeing softened when they clearly didnt need to be which is just plain sloppy. I also\n\nhave a sneaking suspicion that they took some of the textures from the 2000\n\nversion of realmyst and hastily ran them through crazy bump. I love the original\n\nMyst. It is a masterpiece, but this just seems like a sloppy insult to the original,\n\nwhich is exactly what I thought of the original realMyst from 2000. I hate to say\n\nthis, because Myst is so close to my heart, but I cannot reccomend dropping 17\n\ndollars on this mess of a game. If you're going to remake a classic for a 20th\n\nanniversary, have the decency to do it right.","February 6, 2014","false","8.2"," 5 of 23 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","5","23","0","5"

It's a great concept- the player has to rely on visual and auditory observations to solve some large-scale puzzles, which are all completely logical and range in difficulty from easy to medium-hard (but I've played quite a lot of adventure games and am used to them; newcomers to adventure gaming may find the puzzles harder, but still doable). There is no pixel-hunting and no inventory system, which automatically dispenses with inventory item combination puzzles found in most adventure games.\n\nThe developers suggest playing the game as if the players were actually present in the Myst universe, for a fully immersive experience and to better appreciate the story. Therefore I recommend playing Myst when you have quite a bit of spare time and are mentally relaxed. This is not the sort of game you'd want to play to take a break from your hectic activities or in the midst of a busy time to relieve stress. I made that mistake and my general attitude was just to plough through all the puzzles. Nevertheless, even though I didn't pay much attention to the story (or the environmental story-related clues), I found it fairly intriguing.\n\nThe environments are simultaneously strange and beautiful, and have certain mystic feel to them (probably why the game is called Myst?). There are not a whole lot of things to interact with, which I think is very good, because that means there's very little noise in terms of puzzle-solving; most of the things the player can interact with are related to some puzzle or the other. The music and soundscapes are soothing and appropriate to the environments, especially in Rime age.\n\nNow for some technical issues- first of all, realMyst: Masterpiece Edition is a remastered edition (graphics/interface overhaul) of realMyst, which itself was a remastered edition of Myst. The masterpiece edition also has a free roam feature. In the previous versions, the player had to click on a place the go there and the field of view was quite limited, which may have been restrictive but was not necessarily a bad thing. However, mouse movement in free roam view is very clunky. There are no subtitles, which makes it hard to listen to the characters' monologues, and there are no options to adjust the music level. The graphics aren't -that- good and the game suffers from poor optimization.\n\nStill, I highly recommend it for adventure gaming or puzzle aficionados who don't mind the above-mentioned issues (plus RMME supports achievements and trading cards, and has additional puzzles to Myst or realMyst).","February 19, 2015","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I gave realMyst: Masterpiece Edition a spin to see the changes.\n\nThe greatest improvement made in this edition over the first realMyst is that the virtual boundaries were put back.  Whereas with the first realMyst, the 'openness' made it more likely to miss items you needed to pass for the Myst storyline, Masterpiece Edition replacing the boundaries puts the player back on the path of the story.\n\nThe graphics are an improvement.  While they aren't as dynamic as could be expected from games today, they are a credit to the realism of Myst Island.  Myst V: End of Ages is the only game that has a more realistic rendering of Myst Island.\n\nThe one item that made realMyst an absolute failure still plagues Masterpiece Edition: Performance lags.

I gave realMyst: Masterpiece Edition a spin to see the changes.\n\nThe greatest improvement made in this edition over the first realMyst is that the virtual boundaries were put back.  Whereas with the first realMyst, the 'openness' made it more likely to miss items you needed to pass for the Myst storyline, Masterpiece Edition replacing the boundaries puts the player back on the path of the story.\n\nThe graphics are an improvement.  While they aren't as dynamic as could be expected from games today, they are a credit to the realism of Myst Island.  Myst V: End of Ages is the only game that has a more realistic rendering of Myst Island.\n\nThe one item that made realMyst an absolute failure still plagues Masterpiece Edition: Performance lags.

It still lives up to today's standards, and the lore of this whole series is incredibly deep and rich. Especially nowadays, where games aren't meant to be difficult, MYST is a welcome challenge, as it will keep you thinking and struggling, and the struggle only makes solving the puzzles even more gratifying. Rarely will you find the solution to something simply written down, and if you're playing through it for the first time, you could spend months just exploring the beautiful worlds in MYST. The only thing I can say is keep a journal while playing, you'll want to write down what you're doing and planning on doing so you don't lose your train of thought, and sometimes simply writing down what you've done will spark a thought on what to do next you wouldn't have thought of otherwise. Plus, there are plenty of things you'll want to have recorded for later, such as number sequences and such. Believe me, this game is difficult, if I hadn't kept a journal while playing, I wouldn't have completed it, but that difficulty could hardly be called a con. If you like puzzle games, good story, or are simply tired of multiplayer and simple games, you should definitely give MYST a try. The updated graphics in this version are worth the extra money (plus there's some extra content that I won't spoil here), trust me.","November 6, 2015","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm happy there's a point-and-click mode (in addition to the free-walk mode), and that the point-and-click fully animates transitions.  I'm ecstatic that the world now has solar cycles, and that you get a flashlight, and that the puzzles are unchanged.\n\nI'm less excited that the graphics are not as eye-popping as the original graphics appeared to be 20 years ago.

It has three puzzles (a stove, an elevator, and some crystals).  It has places you can go to, things you can look at, and switches to flip that have nothing to do with any puzzle.

The graphics are fairly good, but still look dated and of course the live action parts are still in their original low resolution. The free roam control scheme is a little clunky but it lets you get around a lot faster than the classic point and click. You can use WASD and shift to sprint, but if you're standing still you have to right click and drag to look around. You'll have to do a lot of running back and forth so you'll appreciate it. The flashlight is great to have because it gets REALLY dark at night.\n\nThe clues for the puzzles are fairly out in the open but some of them take some really out of the box thinking. There is a really great help library, it starts off giving vague hints but you can dig deeper if you're really stumped until it eventually outright tells you what to do, so you'll never get stuck (unless you refuse to use it). It tries very hard to minimize spoilers. You will also have to obsessively screenshot every clue and keep a pad and paper nearby. Read all of the books, there's important stuff in them. One of the ages you'll have to rely on your auditory memory a lot so WARNING if you're tone deaf you will not have fun with this one.\n\nThe funny thing about the puzzles is they all seem pretty obvious in hindsight. There is never anything that's completely unfair or left to guessing or chance, though some of the logic is a little convoluted. Overall if you're good at these types of games or you're not ashamed to take a hint here and there this will be a fairly fast playthrough.

Now don't get me wrong, I enjoyed playing through it and would recomend picking up a copy, but there are some very irritating graphical annoyances which occur in certain worlds.\n\n\nThe videos within the books, alongside some of the sounds dont seem to havebeen updated so if you're  running the game on a larger display enjoy your pixelation. I guess it was too difficult to upscale a video that only took up 1/5th of a display that back then ran in a resolution of usually 800x600, so 1/5th of that upscaled... won't probably look very good and it shows unfortunately. While I realize that re-recording the scenes with Atrus and his sons would probably been difficult to have done, It might have really helped the game.\n\nPOSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW, READ AT YOUR OWN RISK OR IF YOU PLAYED THE ORIGINAL!\n\n\nThe main reason why I gave RM:ME a 7 instead of an 8 is probably the stoneship age. When comming back from the lighthouse if you look at where the waters edge meets the edge of the rock that the ship is on, there's some really funky squares missing or overriding other textures. For the most part though the new effects and heavy rain made up for it somewhat, making it harder to notice but still obviously there to anyone who looks to the left.\n\n\nOne gamebreaking bug I found in the mechanical age involved the elevator that also serves as the controls for rotating the entire tower, if you stand halfway between the door to the elevator and the top floor, and push the down button, (NOT THE MIDDLE ONE THAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO) the elevator will go ALL the way down, without the ability to bring it back up. If you walk to the controlls on top of the elevator, you will fall down on them. The controlls then become locked and if you attempt to use them the game will teleport you up to where you're supposed to be, without the elevator, so you keep falling back down upon it. Very irritating lost about 30 minutes of progression from having to reload a previous save. Easy to replicate this bug, I did it again just to make sure It wasn't a one time thing and you can definitely do this, even today as I'm writing this review.\n\n\nOther than these 2 bugs I found the majority of this remake to be pretty much on par with what I was expecting, They didn't remake the game from scratch as far as I can tell and was expecting. They just moved it to a newer system and adjusted some graphics and tweaked a few things. I enjoyed this version of myst but I didn't feel that it was that big of an improvement from the last remake in 2000. I would recomend getting this when It's on sale. As someone who owns the original ps1 copy of myst still, I feel this remake is more of a graphical retexture/update. Even if it's 20 dollars there's some pretty ugly seams in the stoneship age, along with the feeling that the channelwood age is a bit lacking now, it's hard to explain but when you go there it just doesn't really feel like someone lived there. Hard to explain, but if you grab a copy perhaps you'll feel different.\n\nI guess in summary, this remake was somewhat what I expected, although it disappointed me in a couple areas and ruined a bit of the immersion that the original myst worked on building up. Even with the problems I'd still say it was an interesting experience, and worth the 8 dollars I paid for it when it was on sale.","June 29, 2014","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Turns out, most of my best memories were from the sequeal, Riven and the third sequel.\n\nThe first Myst game is full of interesting ♥♥♥♥ing puzzles but a lot of them are so obscure that it takes quite a while just to find out what the puzzle even is. There are 4 hints in the hub area of the game that all lead to different "ages", which are different worlds. Each world takes about 20-30 minutes to complete if you are somewhat good at problem solving. I haven't played this game since I was about eight or nine and it took me about 3 hours to complete it and I squoze an extra hour out of it just trying to get Steam Achievements.\n\nThis game is a great adventure game, but it's short and it feels lacking, despite it being a classic. I am reccommending it solely because it's a great experience to have, but you should ONLY buy it if it's on sale. 18 dollars is RIDICULOUS for an 10+ year old game ("remade" or not) that barely lasts 4 hours.","May 11, 2015","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a great concept- the player has to rely on visual and auditory observations to solve some large-scale puzzles, which are all completely logical and range in difficulty from easy to medium-hard (but I've played quite a lot of adventure games and am used to them; newcomers to adventure gaming may find the puzzles harder, but still doable). There is no pixel-hunting and no inventory system, which automatically dispenses with inventory item combination puzzles found in most adventure games.\n\nThe developers suggest playing the game as if the players were actually present in the Myst universe, for a fully immersive experience and to better appreciate the story. Therefore I recommend playing Myst when you have quite a bit of spare time and are mentally relaxed. This is not the sort of game you'd want to play to take a break from your hectic activities or in the midst of a busy time to relieve stress. I made that mistake and my general attitude was just to plough through all the puzzles. Nevertheless, even though I didn't pay much attention to the story (or the environmental story-related clues), I found it fairly intriguing.\n\nThe environments are simultaneously strange and beautiful, and have certain mystic feel to them (probably why the game is called Myst?). There are not a whole lot of things to interact with, which I think is very good, because that means there's very little noise in terms of puzzle-solving; most of the things the player can interact with are related to some puzzle or the other. The music and soundscapes are soothing and appropriate to the environments, especially in Rime age.\n\nNow for some technical issues- first of all, realMyst: Masterpiece Edition is a remastered edition (graphics/interface overhaul) of realMyst, which itself was a remastered edition of Myst. The masterpiece edition also has a free roam feature. In the previous versions, the player had to click on a place the go there and the field of view was quite limited, which may have been restrictive but was not necessarily a bad thing. However, mouse movement in free roam view is very clunky. There are no subtitles, which makes it hard to listen to the characters' monologues, and there are no options to adjust the music level. The graphics aren't -that- good and the game suffers from poor optimization.\n\nStill, I highly recommend it for adventure gaming or puzzle aficionados who don't mind the above-mentioned issues (plus RMME supports achievements and trading cards, and has additional puzzles to Myst or realMyst).","February 19, 2015","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

These re-releases show that to me. But it can be nice to revisit the old island, check out how the spaceship is doing. See if that giant cog is still there, if that boiler still works.\n\nMoving around independently is nice, but adds little beyond seeing places previously rendered in still images from the occasional new angle. The updated graphics leave something to be desired. The game feels torn between being locked into its small levels from the 90s and expressing its beauty with the technology of today. In this way it begins to feel out of place, odd. For another example, the video of the brothers trapped in their books is painfully low-quality (understandably so!), and the "distortion" effect, reminiscent of VHS degradation or antenna tuning, shows its age.\n\nPart of what makes the appeal of the original Myst so unattainable is that I, we, are different people now. Not only was I extremely young and exploring a fantasy world for the first time, but in 20 years we've seen what games are capable of. We've explored amazing worlds with hidden stories and mysterious origins. Time and video gaming has moved on, and while Myst will be remembered for its landmark status at the time, it, like early 3D games, will be less playable going forward.\n\nI enjoyed the additional age after beating the game. It was a nice epilogue to the original. I liked that there was an internal help system for those who might need it. I felt it could have been implemented better, just like the controls, which I never fully got used to. But the additional feature is nice.\n\nI'm not sure if I recommend this generally. It's often really cheap, so there's little cost to getting it. If you want to relive a shadow, if a crisp, well-defined and anti-aliased shadow, of the original experience, get it. Don't expect magic, though.\n\nHmm. It appears I HAVE to either recommend or not. I imagined this without a thumbs-up or -down. But given the price and the frequency it's on sale, it's an okay buy.\n\n(I wrote a more personal and sprawling review of this game[enduringbeta.com] on my website.)","December 28, 2014","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It still lives up to today's standards, and the lore of this whole series is incredibly deep and rich. Especially nowadays, where games aren't meant to be difficult, MYST is a welcome challenge, as it will keep you thinking and struggling, and the struggle only makes solving the puzzles even more gratifying. Rarely will you find the solution to something simply written down, and if you're playing through it for the first time, you could spend months just exploring the beautiful worlds in MYST. The only thing I can say is keep a journal while playing, you'll want to write down what you're doing and planning on doing so you don't lose your train of thought, and sometimes simply writing down what you've done will spark a thought on what to do next you wouldn't have thought of otherwise. Plus, there are plenty of things you'll want to have recorded for later, such as number sequences and such. Believe me, this game is difficult, if I hadn't kept a journal while playing, I wouldn't have completed it, but that difficulty could hardly be called a con. If you like puzzle games, good story, or are simply tired of multiplayer and simple games, you should definitely give MYST a try.

It has a lot of interesting puzzles (some much more difficult than others), and doesn't explicitly tell you how to solve any of them (or even really give you hints unless you consult an ingame advice book). This is both a good thing and a bad thing, in my opinion. It allows the player to feel a sense of accomplishment when they make progress, but can occasionally cause the player to feel frustrated and lost - then again, I imagine that's the sense the developers wanted to portray at points in the game. Despite this being the remastered version of Myst, I still feel like parts of the game haven't really aged well. For example, many of the clicking mechanics feel off, some of the cutscenes are extremely low-quality, and the free-roam mode doesn't always control well (but is still much better than the point-and-click mode).

For a 20 year old game they've done a nice job of making it look good. This game just drops you onto Myst island with no hand holding advice about what to do. You need to explore and figure things out. I really liked the puzzles in this game. Theres no obscure ridiculous ones. They all felt intuitive and if you explore your surroundings enough you'll eventually figure out the solution. The game really does a great job of giving subtle hints and clues. ( Thats not to say i didn't need to google a hint every now and again).\n\nGood points:\n- Nice remastered graphics\n- The islands in the game make for a very memorable setting. They seem so unique and unusual that it fits the game perfectly\n- Brilliant puzzles that are intuitive enough that they dont frustrate.\n\nBad points:\n- The free roam controls felt a bit fiddly when walking about\n\nOverall this is a great game that im glad i finally got to play. If you havent ever played this game it's worth picking up this edition. Also worth mentioning if your completely stuck on a puzzle, try the Myst guide on Universal Hints System instead of just googling the answers. It'll give you useful hints without spoiling the answer as solving the puzzles yourself, even with a hint or two, is more enjoyable then just getting the direct solution.","August 20, 2015","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Most of the computer games I've played were board games, Solitaire, "push-the-block" puzzle games, and Space Cadet Pinball. It wasn't until recent years, where I found out about the world of early PC games, particularly LucasArts point n' click adventures, such as the Monkey Island series, but chose to stick with my N64 and PS2. As I continued gaming, I became more and more accustomed to the newer generations, but as gaming morphed into a soulless machine spewing out nothing but meatheads in power-armor teabagging endless n00bs, boring brown enviroments, gun and ragdoll physics, etc, I started exploring the realms the more cerebral games of yore just to keep my interest in the hobby alive. One of the games in particular that peaked my interest in the adventure genre is, Myst.\n\nMyst is a graphic adventure game from 1993. The game thrived on the PC back then and was remade and ported several times on many systems, including the Playstation, Sega Saturn, the Jaguar CD of all things, and Nintendo DS & 3DS (Both are regarded as the worst ports of the game) I did prior research in the game and checked out a bunch of reviews. Almost all of them kept yapping about how they loved this game as a kid, all this nostalgia-gushing, how the reviewers kept kissing the game's ♥♥♥. I kept thinking, "Is there ANY reviewer sees this game for what it is, other than from childhood significance?" I decided to give the game a shot on my PS3, via PSOne Classics. I played it and I hated it...at first\n\nIn the game, you take the role of the stranger. Some random stumble-♥♥♥♥ who happens upon a book that transports him/her to the island of Myst. The Stranger is left with no choice, but to explore the island. The island holds a library, a rocket, an observatory, a cabin, and a power room. All of which contain puzzles for the Stranger to solve. These puzzles reveal four different books that transport the Stranger to different worlds, called "Ages". Upon entering the library, the Stranger finds two standalone books, the red and blue book. Both contain a message shrouded in static as both books have missing pages. The pages have been scattered through the different Ages located on Myst Island. The Stranger is now tasked to piece together why he/she is there by putting together the books and deciphering the messages.\nThe main detractor of the game is the whole graphic adventure aspect. As soon as you start the game, it places you on a picture of the island, and a cursor. You start clicking around and realize your means of locomotion are through pointing and clicking, suffering screen-by-screen. I've been spoiled by 3D-games like Mario 64, Banjo-Kazooie, even first-person games like Perfect Dark. The screen-by-screen felt really strange and slow. It took time to get used to it and I eventually stopped noticing. As soon as I got used to it, I was in for a cerebral, and sometimes obtuse ride.\n\nThe game averts several gaming mechanics. There is no combat system, no enemies to fight, no risk of dying, no time limit, and no hands to hold. Myst Island is your oyster! Also, be prepared to take notes. Seriously, you're going to have to write a whole bunch of stuff down. Many of the puzzles involve memorizing numbers, symbols, safe combinations, some of them are visual puzzles, some are auditory (One involves deciphering sounds to distinguish between north, south, east, and west) This isn't a game that you play, but one that you experience. It's solely about piecing together the story of how you got there and how you're supposed to leave.\n\nMyst is quite a unique experience. I'd liken it to those "escape the Room" puzzles, but on a much bigger scale. The puzzles are challenging, if not a bit obtuse, the settings look nice, given the old graphics (I'd recommend the Masterpiece Edition, an HD remastering) and story seems interesting, (Though, I'll have to play the other 4 to get the whole story). If you're tired of teabagging n00bs and wish to experience a game that involves your grey matter, rather than an itchy trigger finger, then step up and see what you've been missing.","August 20, 2015","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was such a great looking game and created such a buzz that there was even an hour long program discussing the game and showing some of the gameplay and features. It was the first game I got when I bought my first computer in 1995. It has been 17 years since I last played the game.\nNow, here is realMYST. Much has changed from the original game. You can now play in free roam mode (classic mode still available for those who prefer, but if you are trying to get the achievements, you must play in free roam mode or you won't get many of them) which lets you look and move in 360 degrees. Graphically, it's not the revelation it was in 1993, but still looks solid. The music and sound effects are still the same with a few extra things thrown in. Still brings up the great nostalgic feeling I had back then.

It has a lot of interesting puzzles (some much more difficult than others), and doesn't explicitly tell you how to solve any of them (or even really give you hints unless you consult an ingame advice book). This is both a good thing and a bad thing, in my opinion. It allows the player to feel a sense of accomplishment when they make progress, but can occasionally cause the player to feel frustrated and lost - then again, I imagine that's the sense the developers wanted to portray at points in the game. Despite this being the remastered version of Myst, I still feel like parts of the game haven't really aged well. For example, many of the clicking mechanics feel off, some of the cutscenes are extremely low-quality, and the free-roam mode doesn't always control well (but is still much better than the point-and-click mode). Overall, there were some parts of the story that I didn't like, but the different worlds and puzzles made the game pretty interesting.","November 13, 2015","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My dad used to play it back when I was a kid and when I asked him to play, I got no where. Definately not a kid game; not because it is graphic, which it is not at all, but because of the percise logic that this game demands from you. However, I resorted to watching my dad play it hours on end. The mysterious storyline and the music is captivating. I've been looking for it all over since I'm a lot older and I own a Mac (it used to only be on PCs). I just beat the game, but if it wasn't for the hints, I'd still be banging my head on my desk. What I appreciated is that they put hints/clues that did not give you direct answers unless you really wanted them. They gave you clues or thoughts to help trigger solutions to problems you might be facing.\n\nYou start off this game by entering this Age called Myst and you just have to explore since you don't know how or why you got there. If you liked Amnesia, which starts the same way and also requires you to explore to find clues and requires reading, this is a great game. However, it is NOT as dark as Amnesia. It is more Sci-Fy then Horror and there are no monsters jumping out at you. But this game can be very eerie, simply because you are alone. There's no other physical beings around you, just their stories that have been left behind. It also requires you to figure out who and what to trust based on your judgment. There's 4 possible endings to the game.\n\nIf you like strategy or findings clues and putting one and two together, get this game. Some of the visuals changed from the original PC, but it was still satisfying for me. There's so much thought and logic put into the puzzles in this game, which can make it VERY challenging.\n\nWill forever recommend.","July 27, 2015","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Apart from "it's better than the 3DS version" -\n\nFirst of all, unless you've literally never played any version of this game before, the puzzles are not going to surprise you because THEY ARE STILL EXACTLY THE SAME. You can literally dig out your old notes from twenty years ago and use them to get through to the endgame.  This is probably my only real complaint with the re-releases of Myst, at least as far as the gameplay is concerned; would it have been so hard to add a random element to the puzzles?  Or maybe change a couple of them a little?  (Well, okay, there's a new Rime age and all, but even that one has been recycled from the original RealMyst.)\n\nSo I guess nostalgia rules in the realm of Myst... but the main appeal of this game has always been its appearance, and I'm happy to say that has improved.  This version updates the original RealMyst to bring it in line with what modern hardware can produce, and the full 3D movement makes navigating the islands much easier (Channelwood treetops, I'm loking at you).\n\nThe Steam version brings Myst up to date with Achievements, because that's what the kids are into these days (okay, I had fun trying to get them all too).\n\nIf you're into the quiet, cerebral and immersive type of game, why not go for the one that made itself a landmark and give this game a try?  If you're an old fan of the game, there won't be too much in the way of new content to bring you back, but you'll have already made up your mind on this game by now anyway!","July 26, 2015","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Most of the computer games I've played were board games, Solitaire, "push-the-block" puzzle games, and Space Cadet Pinball. It wasn't until recent years, where I found out about the world of early PC games, particularly LucasArts point n' click adventures, such as the Monkey Island series, but chose to stick with my N64 and PS2. As I continued gaming, I became more and more accustomed to the newer generations, but as gaming morphed into a soulless machine spewing out nothing but meatheads in power-armor teabagging endless n00bs, boring brown enviroments, gun and ragdoll physics, etc, I started exploring the realms the more cerebral games of yore just to keep my interest in the hobby alive. One of the games in particular that peaked my interest in the adventure genre is, Myst.\n\nMyst is a graphic adventure game from 1993. The game thrived on the PC back then and was remade and ported several times on many systems, including the Playstation, Sega Saturn, the Jaguar CD of all things, and Nintendo DS & 3DS (Both are regarded as the worst ports of the game) I did prior research in the game and checked out a bunch of reviews. Almost all of them kept yapping about how they loved this game as a kid, all this nostalgia-gushing, how the reviewers kept kissing the game's ♥♥♥. I kept thinking, "Is there ANY reviewer sees this game for what it is, other than from childhood significance?" I decided to give the game a shot on my PS3, via PSOne Classics. I played it and I hated it...at first\n\nIn the game, you take the role of the stranger. Some random stumble-♥♥♥♥ who happens upon a book that transports him/her to the island of Myst. The Stranger is left with no choice, but to explore the island. The island holds a library, a rocket, an observatory, a cabin, and a power room. All of which contain puzzles for the Stranger to solve. These puzzles reveal four different books that transport the Stranger to different worlds, called "Ages". Upon entering the library, the Stranger finds two standalone books, the red and blue book. Both contain a message shrouded in static as both books have missing pages. The pages have been scattered through the different Ages located on Myst Island. The Stranger is now tasked to piece together why he/she is there by putting together the books and deciphering the messages.\nThe main detractor of the game is the whole graphic adventure aspect. As soon as you start the game, it places you on a picture of the island, and a cursor. You start clicking around and realize your means of locomotion are through pointing and clicking, suffering screen-by-screen. I've been spoiled by 3D-games like Mario 64, Banjo-Kazooie, even first-person games like Perfect Dark. The screen-by-screen felt really strange and slow. It took time to get used to it and I eventually stopped noticing. As soon as I got used to it, I was in for a cerebral, and sometimes obtuse ride.\n\nThe game averts several gaming mechanics. There is no combat system, no enemies to fight, no risk of dying, no time limit, and no hands to hold. Myst Island is your oyster! Also, be prepared to take notes. Seriously, you're going to have to write a whole bunch of stuff down. Many of the puzzles involve memorizing numbers, symbols, safe combinations, some of them are visual puzzles, some are auditory (One involves deciphering sounds to distinguish between north, south, east, and west) This isn't a game that you play, but one that you experience. It's solely about piecing together the story of how you got there and how you're supposed to leave.\n\nMyst is quite a unique experience. I'd liken it to those "escape the Room" puzzles, but on a much bigger scale. The puzzles are challenging, if not a bit obtuse, the settings look nice, given the old graphics (I'd recommend the Masterpiece Edition, an HD remastering) and story seems interesting, (Though, I'll have to play the other 4 to get the whole story). If you're tired of teabagging n00bs and wish to experience a game that involves your grey matter, rather than an itchy trigger finger, then step up and see what you've been missing.","August 20, 2015","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For a 20 year old game they've done a nice job of making it look good. This game just drops you onto Myst island with no hand holding advice about what to do. You need to explore and figure things out. I really liked the puzzles in this game. Theres no obscure ridiculous ones. They all felt intuitive and if you explore your surroundings enough you'll eventually figure out the solution. The game really does a great job of giving subtle hints and clues. ( Thats not to say i didn't need to google a hint every now and again).\n\nGood points:\n- Nice remastered graphics\n- The islands in the game make for a very memorable setting. They seem so unique and unusual that it fits the game perfectly\n- Brilliant puzzles that are intuitive enough that they dont frustrate.\n\nBad points:\n- The free roam controls felt a bit fiddly when walking about\n\nOverall this is a great game that im glad i finally got to play. If you havent ever played this game it's worth picking up this edition. Also worth mentioning if your completely stuck on a puzzle, try the Myst guide on Universal Hints System instead of just googling the answers. It'll give you useful hints without spoiling the answer as solving the puzzles yourself, even with a hint or two, is more enjoyable then just getting the direct solution.","August 20, 2015","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Personally I found the free camera to be unwieldy and nauseating.\n\nrealMyst: Masterpiece Edition is an enjoyable game that really attempted to mimic the original in everything down to the puzzles. The puzzles were fairly difficult, and if you missed any clue, you were dead in the water. I found that the game didn't hand hold, and you couldn't really tell which object was interactable. The story was minimal, but the embedded videos were an interesting addition and the acting was portrayed in very different, but positive, way.\n\nGraphics-wise, the atmospheric effects were a nice touche as was the day/night cycle. However for a 2014 game, the 3D models were very dry and plain in some levels.\n\n9/10.","March 22","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

From the very first questions of "What is this place?" and "What do I even have to do?" until the very-very realMyst end.\n\nIt's a 1st-person point-n-click game with a lot of journals to read and a lot of puzzles to solve. There's no hand-holding whatsoever – and I loved it! (mostly …) None of the puzzles are impossible or unfair. All you need is your mind and a sense for discovery: there are enough in-game hints, and much can be solved with pure logic. However, even though most often you need to THINK, there are also times when you need to PLAY AROUND – and there's no telling of when to do what.\n\nMastering these riddles completely on your own in a time full of flashing arrows, quest markers, YouTube Let's Plays and online databases makes the experience feel so much more rewarding. They are ~2o year old puzzles, after all! You really do feel smart solving them without any walkthrough.\n\nUnfortunately I must admit that I did use a walkthrough – and let this be noted as a big dissatisfaction – namely after already having reached the end of the game! That's right: I solved the very last puzzle and didn't even realize it; I had to learn that from a walkthrough. As nice of a fanservice adding a new Age to the remake may have been, without a proper ending it felt very unfinished.\n\nAside from that, the now seamless spatial movement – the original used still images – is greatly appreciated.

That game was very challenging in those days but I eventually beat it. I always wanted to play Myst because Riven didn't make much sense because I never knew any backstory.\n\nI eventually borrowed a friend's copy of Myst in 2002 or so and played it and loved it. I researched into the series and found out there was a 3D remake of Myst called realMyst. I found a copy of it at Staples (lol) and played the crap out of it. Even though it was fun, you could tell there were issues with the controls and the game had many glitches.\n\nBut this right here? THIS is what Cyan should have made when the timing was right. I LOVE that you can play with the old point and click controls, because I was very fond of those controls in the past. I just finished this for the first time and did it pretty quick because I remembered all of the puzzle solutions, but it was still just as fun as I remembered.\n\nI highly recommend this to fans of adventure games with a good story and good puzzles. The "book" cutscenes haven't aged well, but I can see why they kept MOST of the original videos. Recasting wouldn't make much sense, but that's just a small complaint.\n\nHere's hoping Steam eventually gets Myst III and Myst IV.","May 7","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
