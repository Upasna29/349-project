There are no dialogs, quest givers or even much of a story at this point (something about destroying some corruption.)\n\nYour job is to explore with your party of five and kill camps full of evildoers. Along the way you'll find caves and buildings that when entered, will give you a quest that you complete within it.\n\nCharacter building and combat is defintely the focus. The leveling system has a ton of options, skills and spells. There are no set classes; any character can have any skill and wear any armor, but there are penalties such as heavier armor makes energy regen slower.\n\nThe comabt is real-time with no ability to pause. There is a "tactical" mode that is too slow for my tastes, and an arcade mode that is faster. I played in arcade mode with the combat speed set to 140%.\n\nThe loot at this point is limited to weapons and suits of armor, along with hp/energy potions and a resurrection item.\n\nI completed the game in about 7 hours. Again, this is the initial early access release in February, 2016. It will certainly get more content, but I felt it was worth the $10 price already if you like to explore and kill stuff. If you are looking for an engaging story and colorful character dialogs, this may not be for you (right now.)\n\n\n","February 16","true","8.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

I like the idea of the open world fighting, But the combat system is a little to slow even in the fast game mode. It seams like they dont attack when you click on them takes anywhere from 10 seconds to 15 after you chose witch guy to go fight what monster. Other than that its been pretty fun. Not worth the price they ask should be a $5-$10 game MAX. Good luck on develment ill be checking it out again soon","February 12","true","0.4"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","9","13","2","4"
