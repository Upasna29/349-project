It seems development has resumed and the game isn't abandoned after all. After a gap of nearly 7 months, a hefty update arrived out of the blue. I'd uninstalled the game, so didn't know about it until now - about 3 weeks later.\n\nThe fact I kept checking back on this game periodically, rather than just forgetting about it, can be taken as a compliment to the game. I said before that the game lookED promising (past tense) but now it lookS promising (present tense!) again. This is a good thing.\n\nI wish these Steam reviews weren't so binary - only Positive or Negative - because, ideally, I'd like to change my rating to Neutral / Pending / Let's See How It Goes From Here :)\n\n--original review--\n\nAs of today, it's been 5 months since the last update. FIVE MONTHS. This game looked promising to begin with, but remains at around 25% complete with little chance that it will ever be finished now. It really should be removed from sale. Needless to say, don't buy it.\n\nI'm not particularly aggrieved at having spent my money on this unfinished, dead game - it didn't cost very much, and it's understood that buying into an Early Access game carries the risk that the project will never reach completion. What DOES annoy me is the damage that abandoned projects like this do to the concept of Early Access games as a whole.\n\nAfter being burned by this one, I'm going to very wary of Early Access games from now on, and will likely only trust Early Access games from established devs with a solid track-record of delivering the goods. That's the real shame, because I'm sure there are hundreds of fledgling devs out there who really need Early Access support and fully intend to honour their commitments. It's horrible that unfinished and abandoned games like this one will have poisoned the well for them.","July 6, 2014","false","1.0"," 24 of 29 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","24","29","0","0"

Instead of shooting for over-the-top, big budget cinematics and new-fangled combat systems, Jigxor is instead creating a pixellated hodge-podge of classic, unmistakable characters and enemies in the sort of caves, castles and forests dungeon-delvers from across the ages have grown to know and love. Hell- even the way the characters and enemies move is remniscent of moving tiny figures across a pen-and-paper board game. Simply charming.\nYet, at the same time, the game was engaging. Not once did I feel as though there were any concepts beyond my understanding, or that everything was mired in computation and complexity. Not to mention the quick-paced combat allowed me to pick up the game whenever I wanted, whether I was interested in a full-scale exploration experience or a quick romp across some goblin faces.\nSometimes, you don't want to embark on a life-devouring journey through Skyrim, or read the pulse-pounding stories of Mass Effect. Sometimes, you just want to put on your robe and wizard hat, fill your pockets with loot and come out with a smile on your face.

(bug fixes and quality improvements are mandatory anyway so they don't count)\n\nI understand Valve takes no responsibilility here but sure makes a lot of money so they should do more about abandonware and scammers besides some ea disclaimer on the store page.","July 25, 2014","false","0.4"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

While there are still small subsets of gamers who play board games, it doesn't appeal to the masses as it once use to. Dungeon Dashers tries to break that mould with a PC turn-based dungeon crawler, while still giving you the feeling of a table top game which you'd play with friends. Characters move in a sort of jumping animation, just like you'd do if you were to move your character in any board game. The simple yet very effective tilesets help reinforce this feeling and gives this odd sense of depth, almost as if you're leaning over the board and playing.\n\nCombat is simple enough to understand and you're able to get up to speeds with things very quickly. Keeping all your characters alive is another question and the promise of a hardcore mode in the future will really spice things up. You have an array of skills and gear sets which modify each of your characters, allowing you to tailor the characters to your liking, while still making them all feel unique.\n\nThe game is in Early Access and as such it's missing quite a lot. The story is quite short as of this review, not all the skills and items have been added yet and simple things like purchasing consumables with all the gold you collect are not yet enabled. In saying that you'll still spend a couple of hours trying to get the best score in all the levels, and working out the optimal way to keep all your characters nice and healthy.\n\nWhile I highly recommend picking this game up just be aware of the Early Access, it's not a complete product. For $10 though you can't really go wrong, and you can keep checking back with the game and see all the awesome updates.","December 15, 2013","true","2.6"," 19 of 35 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","19","35","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sauven/recommended/252210/","sauven","Sauven","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sauven/","271 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nNOTE: This game is not finished, and not, currently, worth $10.\n\nThat being said, I'm giving my recommendation for the game. Why? Because it has great potential. The demo, while short, shows great promise, fun game play, entertaining, if stereotypical, characters, and a pleasant art style. As many know already the developer made a 'side project' called Crossy Road, a Frogger clone for IOS and Android. While it annoys me that he went and created a new game while leaving this one unfinished, I can also see that Crossy Road was simple, and took off beyond anyone's expectations. Hopefully its success will help fund Dungeon Dashers to completion.\nThe latest update says that they are rebuilding the game in Unity, and honestly I can see why this may be necessary, given the limits of the old engine. The only complaint I have with moving it to Unity is the developers suggestion that he might change the art style, which I believe would hinder the game overall, but we'll see.\nOverall my biggest complaint is lack of communication by the developer, The last update was in June of 2015, over half a year ago. Before that the last update was in September of 2014, which released the latest version of the game. It seems to me that the game is dangerously close to being abandonware. I really hope that the developer is working on finishing the game, because I really want to see it completed. This was the first, and only Early Access game that I've ever bought, in fact I bought it before it was on Steam. It breaks my heart that there hasn't been more updates on the development.\nAndy, if you read this, I don't have a huge problem with the game taking a long time, my problem is your failure to communicate with your costumers. Even if just to say that you're still working on it, you should provide some sort of update, rather than letting us assume that you've abandoned the game.\n\nSo again, the game shows a lot of potential, and looks like it could be a lot of fun. However, in its current state DO NOT BUY. Wait until the developer has provided more information on the future of Dungeon Dashers. I will gladly update this review if anything changes.","January 16","true","5.3"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

I fell in love right from the start. From the quirky movements to the familiar turn based goodness and the pure old school-esque music, this game is already a gem in my book. It's a dungeon crawler rpg, though not as quite serious as most, with a few good laughs and a fun party of characters who clearly dont always get along. The developer seems to want to bring back their childhood, yet makes the ever popular genre still feel fresh and I must say its a step in the right direction. Of course some things need to be adressed such as one level I was in, cant remember the name sorry, where the mage got stuck interacting with a fountain. This caused me to unfortuantely exit and restart the level, but it only happened once, and those kinds of things are to be expected.\n\nYes, the game is unfinished as of now, but I say if you had any doubts, you should change your mind and give it a chance. 5 out 5 for me (for its current state). One thing I will add though is that there were plenty of weapons, armor and skills I just did not unlock during my play through, I am not sure wether these will be added or if I just havn't played enough but thats something maybe someone can answer for me?","December 21, 2013","true","3.1"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

The game is simple enough that I could teach my five year old little girl the basics of attacking and using cover while taking my time between turns to explain concepts to her.  And the puzzles and some of the combat scenarios were engaging enough that I never felt bored.\n\nMy only complaint, and I have feeling this will be remedied as the developers keep working was that our adventure was just too short.  I would love to see more levels, more puzzles, and perhaps to assist the developers, an editor so that fan made content and levels could be constructed.

Though still in develpoment, they've provided a fun to play game, with an evident direction of more to come. The core party mechanic is good stuff, with each class having unique powers for navigating certain situations. While only one has to reach the exit to revive any fallen party members and advance, it creates a subtle level of stratagy in making sure (sometimes) that the "right" person survives.  As it's still in development, it's not complete (duh), but this is one of those games that has been fun to watch as it goes, and it's going nicely.

This game had an unbeatable stage early on that blocked out most of the game's content. This has been fixed but you currently have to go to the steam forums and follow the intructions for Sand Warrens to patch it.\n\nGAMEPLAY - The actual gameplay is superb. You control a squad of four adventurers and engage in incredibly fast paced grid-based combat. It is probably the quickest turn based combat of any game like this I have played. Very streamlined. Each character has a handful of abilities you use through a hot key bar. Moving around and attacking drains AP and your turn ends when you are out of AP. You can hold down a key to fast forward through enemy turns.\n\nThere is a lot of tactical decision making, using cover to advance up on ranged units, triggering traps to skewer enemies, blocking in enemies and protecting your glass cannons. Backstabbing. The action point system lets you make decisions like "should I make one more attack or should I walk back behind cover so these archers can't shoot me"\n\nIt is fairly easy on normal difficulty. I recommend playing on hard where your choices feel like they have more consequences.\n\nAESTHETICS- The presentation is very pleasing. The game really reminds me of table top rolepaying with minatures. Especially with the very cute shimmying back and forth walking animation each of your characters gets. Sort of like in a player picked up a mini and "walked" it to a different square. The music is your standard indie game chiptune stuff. It is alright.","December 20, 2014","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is easy to dismiss as something of an forgotten era - but I say that that era deserves games like this. It comes down to picking up on the dungeon crawling that has been pushed back as something from the very age of early days that should be forgotten and something to feel ashame by. Is it? No it is a true little gem with nice dungeons, some puzzles and tactic fighting. It is easy to play, it is a bit clicheé but it is fun, it is easy to get caught and it feels just right on so many levels :)\n\nNow, the true problem - the game ends all of a sudden. And you think that well soon the new levels and more fun will come from teh early access right? Nope - sorry. The updates are few and lonmg between. The state of support for this game is not certain so the game might be dead in the water for now so unless you want to spend some money on very little content - I would suggest that even though it is promising - stay away until support has been determined.","February 21, 2015","false","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

One update since which added a handful of levels. Then they made a mobile game that allegedly brought in big money and we never saw an update since.\n\nA month ago the Dev did post a topic in the forums (Just a topic, no news article though, so don't blame the players for not knowing) that he is going to gather a team of programmers to re-make the game in Unity. He always seemed like a nice person in the forums, so I'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt.\n\nBut since Steam made us so skeptical.
