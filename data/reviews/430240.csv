Every level has unique puzzles to solve and I'm always looking forward to what new tricks and techniques I'll need to use to solve the next level.\nI would say this game is extremely challenging, some levels require precise execution while others require intense thinking and planning. All this makes it feel extremely rewarding and satisfying when you complete a challenging level.\n\nWould recommend to anyone who liked portal for it's puzzle-platforming and enjoys a difficult game.","January 29","true","2.0"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

Portal required some of this skill too - which i'm not very good at, but it gave you a lot more leeway to fail.  This one requires precision jumping to the point where I'd spend most of my time navigating the puzzle after I had already solved it.  I'm not a fan of that.  There's also no personality or story which isn't a huge issue for me but it's something I appreciate nonetheless.  Overall I'd say 6/10","January 29","false","1.8"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","0"

It has a LOT of levels to go through each one with a different scenario. I'm already scratching my head by the 10th level or so - just got to the part where new mechanics are brought in to make the puzzles even more interesting/dynamic as you progress. Wish me luck haha\n\n","February 2","true","0.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Almost... but not quite. Between the main actions of extruding and retracting elements of the level, portal-esque cubes and balls that must be placed on switches, and more complex mechanics such as the electric wires (one of my favourite parts!), the later levels become increasingly challenging to solve and usually require a lot of experimentation. Duplexer definitely has a few rage moments where a finely-tuned solution is ruined by a stray button click (in fact, some levels seem to be built around this!), but finally solving a level after carefully examining everything and putting a plan into action is immensly satisfying.\n\nThe graphics are simple, without much more detail than what is required to solve the level. The player can "tag" individual game tiles with a cross-shaped mark much like marking squares in a game of minesweeper - this comes in handy in a bunch of different ways, such as planning out routes for moving objects, or marking the way in a maze. Although a little unpolished, I think that the minimal graphics help the game. Filling stages with anything extra would be pretty distracting in such a puzzle-heavy game. The music and sound effects probably won't blow you away, but they definitely add to the gameplay experience without being repetitive.\n\nOverall: if you're looking for a puzzle game with interesting mechanics and want to actually feel challenged (I'm looking at you, Portal 2!), then I'd recommend Duplexer. Don't let the simple style scare you away from a great game.\nDisclaimer: I do know a developer, but this didn't change how I reviewed the game. I loved it!\n\nTL;DR: Great mechanics with some very tricky puzzles, it'll keep you busy.","March 18","true","6.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The only reviewer who actually finished.  I still cannot recommend this game based on certain aspects.\n\nFirst, you will fail.\n\nThis is a running joke in this game as you are forced to fail at random times.  Not my style of hardcore joking?  This is built around speed racers, and as I know speed racers, you die a bazillion times before you master the level.  This is not my style of game play, but that's what the developers wanted to cater towards.\n\nLEVEL 44 and VARIOUS random levels:  Beware this game is not like others, no previous clues will help you understand that maps are never mentioned or that guessing (getting lucky) is a skill.  No, this is not.  It is tedious and forces a failure.\n\nIf this game was designed so you die, then memorize everything as you die, it's exhausting.  This game is not forgiving.  Jumping/glitching balls/ cubes etc, somethings will collide in unexpected ways.\n\nAfter finishing the 100 levels, jumping is not very well polished, even though you can learn to master it, if you die five billion times.  You will be forced to adapt to the jumping sensitivity that is presented. USE LIGHT PRESSURE.  When moving through certain mazes with jump pads, make sure to look down and stay centered on cubes as you tap lightly with a keyboard.  This game can be unforgiving later on, which is a speed runner mentality in design.\n\nIt's not all jumping, there are some good puzzles... and SOME of those puzzles are about 70%+ of the game.  Only a small portion is truly tedious... if you can get to it...\n\nAlso, the steam achievements do not work first try.  I'm missing some that should have completed.  Still is what it is.\nRated 6/10\n\nPrice point: $5 would be what it's worth in reality.","March 21","false","17.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

Unfortunately there's a lack of polish here that separates games like this from great 3d puzzle games like Portal or The Witness.  Without that charm and personality it just becomes a bit of a chore.  Will update this review after playing some more if things improve.","January 29","false","0.9"," 11 of 25 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","11","25","0","1"
