"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/104020/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Storm in a Teacup is a variation of the saying “a tempest in a teacup” which really means taking a small event and blowing it out of proportion. Since it means making something out of nothing, I’m really struggling with why you’d name your game that. Good news though, the title is really the only thing about this game that’s not awesome. And that’s worth making a bit of a fuss over.\n\nStorm in a Teacup’s controls are pretty straightforward. There are controls to move left and right and then a button to jump, though it’s really more of a take flight kind of motion. You have a charge meter that starts to deplete the second you tap the button and take off. Once the bar runs out you start falling back to the ground and the meter refills. You can double tap to boost higher, and building up speed before launching will definitely send you further.\n\nYou’ll use this jump to navigate obstacles and avoid pitfalls, collecting keys and triggering little contraptions to move your way through the various levels. So really, all the standard tropes you’d find in any platformer, except it puts a heavily reliance on its use of physics in the game world. As such, you could safely say the game took some of its inspiration from titles like Little Big Planet. Because both you and the objects you interact with are supposed to convey weight and momentum.\n\nThis is one of those cases where the game seems to have been changed in order to accommodate a witty title. Why is the character onscreen named “Storm” and why does he fly around in a teacup? Cause it fits the name of the game. Don’t get me wrong, it works gameplay wise, it’s just that it makes zero sense in the game world or reality.\n\nSpeaking of “game world” Storm in a Teacup continually dazzles with its style, looking like something a child would dream up. Mean dark clouds have sinister frowns, platforms are tied up by rope, and some enemies look like they’re made out of cardboard. It’s adorable and trippy all at the same time.\n\nBut don’t be fooled by the cute look of the world, this game gets hard with a capital H. Storm in a Teacup will look to test even the most veteran platform gamer’s skill and patience. Luckily the game is never unfair about it, and you’ll never find yourself in a place where you can’t see because of a bad camera or faulty level design. You can always see what you need to do, it’s just a matter of making it happen.\n\nWith the exception of the name, which is cute, but when taken at it’s meaning does a disservice to the game, I have nothing bad to say about Storm in a Teacup. It’s gorgeous, controls well and offers a good solid challenge. I’ve played a lot of games that I’d consider a tempest in a teapot, but Storm in a Teacup isn’t one of them.","January 8","true","7.9"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","14","14","2","0"

It's not close from being a solid platformer. The music is nice, I must say, but the game is deadly short and Storm is not that easy to control. All the nice mechanics are in the bonus levels. There are some cool parts in the game that are hommages to older games.\n\nIt's not worth 5$ at all in my humble opinion.","October 29, 2013","false","1.5"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","0"

Even the concept is funky as hell since framerate isn't steady, kind of a killer in a game where you sometimes need to "tap" your jumps to make it to the next platform before meter runs out.\n\nMaybe these things will be patched!

I played this with my 4 year old and my 8 year old and they loved it.  It can be tough at times, but most of this game is forgiving.  It's a typical platforming game with a cool floating/soaring gimmick attached to it.  It takes  a bit to get used to, but once you get the hang of it the game itself is pretty simple.  The graphics aren't anything to really brag about, but they fit the gameplay.  Overall, a great game to play with your kids.  If you are an adult, you might lose interest from its simplicity.

I don't recommend this game, and yet, I do. I did not particularly love my time with this game, but I have family members who would. Its charms were fairly lost on me, but I have no problem imagining that others would be completely absorbed.\n\nThe reason for my conflicting emotions is that this game does not have any specific failings. It is enormously adorable,  has a great visual style, pretty tight controls (including controller support), a charmingly cute soundtrack, and simple level design / gameplay.\n\nThe only real problem is that it is not captivating at all. It is spectacularly simple, and fairly repetitive. I could have kept playing without really forcing myself, but I also would have been just as happy to stop playing and turn on an old rerun of Top Gear.\n\nSo, I'm torn. Do I review a game for how I could see others taking its charms? Or, rather, do I review a game with my own personal opinion of it? I tend to lean more towards the personal aspect of reviews, so that's why I chose not to recommend it.\n\nIt's not that I think it's stupid. It is cute, it is easy to play, and it is incredibly cheap. If you have a young child in the house, they will probably love this game. In fact, I will be recommending this to my father, since he loves buying games for my nephews to play when they visit. I tend to like my sidescrollers with a bit more substance, however. Give me Cave Story+, Chasm, Guacamelee, or any 2D Castlevania any day of the week.\n\nTake this all with a grain of salt, of course. If the video in the game store looks interesting to you, give it a try. You have only $5 to lose, and you can barely buy a burrito for that much any more.","September 6, 2014","false","0.1"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","11","18","0","0"

It runs on a 2D physics engine meaning there's a lot of things bouncing and swinging off of each other; this gets especially interesting in the bonus levels that can turn sideways and upside down. Once you've completed each level, you can try to do it again finding a hidden object and without dying, to get extra rewards (well, achievements).\n\nThe downside is that there's only one song in the game, which may get repetitive after awhile. There's no story to speak of, and not a lot of replay value. Still, the game is well worth a shot.","March 25, 2014","true","6.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If you're looking to add some whimsy to your life, this is a great choice. If not, this probably won't be your cup of tea (haha). The gameplay is very simple - you're a dude who floats around in a magic teacup collecting sugar cubes and stickers and avoiding obstacles. Obstacles include lava, angry clouds, pits and various pointy things which cause instant death. What I think makes SIT special is that there is a meter that controls your ability to jump/float that rapidly depletes when you press jump but immediately starts to fill when you release it. This means that you can do a variety of midair maneuvers such as changing directions and jumping higher than you would expect. You can customize your little dude with stickers you collect (mostly just color choices, but boy, do I enjoy the different colors of magic teacup trails). There are a few different game modes. Story mode is 40 levels with no unifying theme per cluster of levels and no appreciable increase in difficulty. Some levels sprinkled in are randomly a little more difficult, but nothing frustratingly so. There is some variety as far as grassy level, boat level, underground level but like I said, there seems to be no rhyme or reason to level order. A few levels add wind obstacles or little shooting mini games and I guess this is called story mode because there are a few pictures at the very beginning and there is a quasi boss battle at the end. The 10 bonus levels add a cool new element - blocks that allow you to rotate the level. Survival mode consists of 5 levels of collecting sugar for two minutes while avoiding obstacles. You get an achievement for collecting 30 sugars in each, but I collected 50 in each in only a few tries. Challenge mode is 5 reworked levels that you have already played that have more obstacles thrown in to make them more of a challenge.\n\nTips & Tricks - So this is the first Steam game that I have unlocked all the achievements on. They are pretty straightforward except for 3. I got the no jump achievement on level 21. (It isn't possible on many of the levels because you cannot reach the goal without jumping unless there are wind boosts on that level). I got the no sugar achievement on level 12. (Again this is not possible on every level because the sugar cubes are often between you and the goal). Lastly, I was stumped at first as to how to get the achievement for perfecting the credits level because the credits did not roll after completing story mode or after completing the bonus levels, although there was a congratulations screen after each. To play the credit level, pick Cobra from the main menu and then click on credits. (Weird).\n\nBottom line - Whimsy! Fun, not overly challenging but decent challenge if you are going for all the achievements which requires perfects on the levels. A nice little diversion. If you're looking for something low stress and sugar-coated, I definitely recommend this. I picked this up during the summer sale for $0.74, so just keep an eye out during the upcoming fall and winter sales if you are interested.","August 30, 2013","true","7.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It possesses an almost childlike sense of wonder and glee that many games lack these days.\n\nThis game is just plain fun, if you can get past the laid back tone and the unique visual style.  It's not addictive, but it is relaxing and does possess a surprising amount of challenging.  Nevertheless, I never got stressed out playing this game.  In fact, it's actually a great stress reliever.

It's not bad, but I wouldn't recommend it. I went through all the levels in approximately 90 minutes. I finished a quarter of them with perfect score, but I don't really see any reason to return to the rest and try to improve. All the same with the bonus levels.\n\nThe game itself is pretty decent and the difficulty is quite okay. The physics sometimes behave a little erratically, and/or counterintuitively, but at least the behaviour is consistent, so once you get used to it, it's not a big deal.\n\nOverall, the game is not bad, but I suggest you go and play some Tobe's Vertical Adventure instead.","July 26, 2012","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Then this is basically not to be missed. Even if you have at best an impartial attitude towards oversized tea cups and the collection of sugar cubes, it's hard not to recommend this one. I imagine the experience of playing this for such a person to be something of a spirtual awakening. The soundtrack alone is worth the money, infact if anybody knows where I can get a CD copy of it to play in my car please post below. I should mention though in this review it's probably not suitable for youngsters due to the obvious adult themes and content.","August 6, 2015","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
