And, of course, she will find strange companions (a priest, a raider, she herself is an alchemist), mysterious items, apparitions, hidden places, and spooky monsters of all sorts as she searches.\nIt appears that the game takes place entirely within and on the grounds of the monastery which adds to the story by confining the action to the goal of discovering all of the secrets the place has to reveal.\n\nArtwork and graphics are very well done, especially the monsters to fight. And the monsters are visible, and sometimes appear with eerie sound effects.\nAnd the sound effects throughout genuinely add to the creepiness of the game.\n\nThe story's pacing is very well handled as just enough information, weapons, and supplies are made available as you go ---- but you must look everywhere very carefully to discover all the secrets.\nAlthough it is fairly linear in the overall layout, you must still stay alert so as to not bypass or overlook items or places that are important.\n\nIt's a little different, but no less fun or exciting and still keeps the 16-bit rpg flavor that I enjoy so much. Story is exceptional, and I would certainly recommend adding this one to any library. Great fun here.\n","August 13, 2015","true","2.6"," 21 of 21 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","21","21","3","0"

The characters are pretty interesting and have unique dialogues, but the story is pretty generic (blah blah evil cult etc). It was an interesting idea to have the entire game set in one building and its grounds.\n\nThe game isn't bad really but it could have used a bit more polish. There are a few typos in the dialogue. The battle system is functional but it was never really clear to me whether various elemental attacks actually had different effects or not so I always ended up just spamming the highest level skill I had rather than using them strategically. Additionally, it was kind of annoying that there was no way to see how much health an enemy has left, so it was hard to know whether to use a skill that used up a lot of SP or not, and you didn't know how far through a boss battle you were. Music was okay but the looping clips were very short so if you were really exploring an area it could get annoying pretty quickly.\n\nMany items that you can interact with are indicated by a little star, but some are not, so sometimes progression would halt for a bit because I didn't have an object that I didn't know I could pick up. Also in some areas it's hard to tell if the edge of the room is a transition to another area or just a wall.\n\nEnemies are visible on the map so they're avoidable if you don't want to fight them at that moment (though it's a little weird that all enemies use the same 3 or 4 sprites) and enemies don't respawn when they're killed, which makes exploration a little more bearable. You will be backtracking over areas as you acquire equipment that makes new areas accessible so this is definitely a good thing.","September 11, 2015","false","16.5"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","15","21","3","0"

Unfortunately, this monastery is home to a number of secrets. She'll have to team up with several other people who have come here for different reasons to try and find her husband.\n\nBlack Home is an around 6-7 hour RPG that also features multiple endings. I'm not quite sure how you trigger the different endings though as I only got one. The entire game takes place within the monastery though the areas look different enough that it doesn't start to feel too dull to always be in the same place. There's only one set of collectibles to find, chess pieces, and you'll have to do a lot of digging and searching to try and find them all.\n\nWhile Black Home might not be something to write home about in the end, it is an interesting game. Most of the game is fairly straightforward - I only got lost once while trying to find what I needed to progress. Some parts may make you think a bit, and as long as you don't mind that the AI of enemies trying to chase you can be a tad shaky at times, then check out Black Home.","August 27, 2015","true","8.6"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","9","12","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kurokunihime/recommended/370700/","kurokunihime","kurokunihime","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kurokunihime/","22 products in account","Black Home is a nice, medium-long, 16-bit turn-based RPG. It has a quite nice atmosphere. It is about a woman who tries to save her husband from a cursed monastery. On the way, you get some people to join in your search. Apparently there are several endings but I got one until now.\n\nI bought the game when it is on sale. If you love 16-bit Victorian gothic style RPG, it is nice game to play. Still, I suggest you to buy it on sale. Because, it is not a remarkable game that everyone needs to play. It has its good and bad sides. It is generally okay to follow the missions but sometimes you lost the clue and wander aimlessly to find what you need to do. Sometimes missions are not clear. Also, you need to complete and collect everything while you are on site. Because, the game set may change due to something you do and you may not have a second chance.\n\nOverall, I liked the game and do not regret I bought it. I love 16-bit RPG games because it is kind of nostalgic.","February 26","true","9.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

I bought this on sale and had low expectations, which were considerably exceeded. If you enjoyed Vagrant Hearts and (the first) Ashes of Immortality, you might like this one. You will spend a few hours roaming a castle, searching for items and using spells on visible enemies.  Some backtracking is required and some items are missable-I ended up replaying to get all the chesspieces.","February 24","true","28.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I actually found the puzzles and especially the ambience incredibly enjoyable.  I just can't recommend this game cause the ending SUCKED!  You go through this really deep and dark story only for the monster to escape, turn on it's captors, your husband to DIE which is THE ENTIRE REASON YOU CAME!  And for a new main villian to appear and kill one of your main characters and then the game just suddenly ends...  no end credits no nice ending scene...  it makes you feel just miserable.","March 18","false","7.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"
