"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/249680/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Every once and a while there comes a game so revolutionary, so full of ambition and creativity and with such flawless execution that they forever change the medium and shape it for years to come. They are the games that we remember decades after their release, and that continue to be cited as inspiration for new games long since we first revered at their brilliance. And then we have Marlow Briggs.\n\nMarlow Briggs and the Mask of Death is not a revolutionary game; it does little if anything unique borrowing heavily from games of yore without ever outdoing them in its own right. It's not the most polish, it's production values are noticeably low, and has some truly aggravating design decisions. But none of this matters because despite being formulaic and shallow Marlow Briggs is unquestionably a blast to play. If ever there was such a thing as a B-game this is it, and what ridiculous amounts of fun it is.\n\nAs the curtain rises we find Marlow Briggs, aka "the man with large hands", arriving to visit his archaeologist girlfriend on a digsite she has been working at lately. Unfortunately, as is usually the case, the operation is in fact being run by a maniacal psychopath possessing godlike magic powers and an army of mercenaries to back him up. Marlow doesn't like this, but before he can take three step towards the door he's sent on a one way trip to Xibalba and his girlfriend kidnapped. Cue flashing lightning and a talking mask and Marlow is reborn as the sacred warrior, hero of prophecy destined to save the sacred land that has been disturbed by the militias presence.\n\nIt should be noted that all of this plays out in the span of about 60 seconds, at which point you are tossed straight into the action. This isn't a game that takes itself seriously; not remotely. The plot is absolutely absurd and the dialog cheesy beyond compare, but Marlow succeeds because it knows it's silly and revels in being as self-aware and goofy as possible as it jumps from setpiece to setpiece with little regard to exposition or the mounting continuity errors. This is a game that wants you to laugh with it not at it, with excellent (for what it is) writing and spot on delivery that made it impossible for me not to enjoy myself, grinning the whole way through.\n\nWhen Marlow and the Mask aren't cracking jokes they're smashing in skulls. It's impossible to ignore so to put it bluntly: this is a God of War clone. Right down to the distinctive way you open chests- er, collect skulls, it plays identically to Sony Santa Monica's lovechild but that really isn't a bad thing. While it isn't as refined as that series, this is a comparable action game with some highly satisfying combat and impressive bossfights. It's nothing new, but it works well for the game and more than solid, with my only complaint being a large amount of overpowered enemies and occasionally getting locked into an animation.\n\nMixed together with the melee arena combat are a plethora of action movie moments such as shooting down helicopters with a mounted turret, and some light platforming and puzzle elements. The variety is great and helped alleviate much of the monotony that otherwise would have occurred from a strictly combat focus through the 6-7 hour campaign.\n\nWhile it won't win any graphics awards, this is actually a rather decent looking title. The environments in particular have a lot of detail put into them, and when the camera pans out for a vista it's a gorgeous site. For a budget title it's pretty impressive, but what I thought was most clever was how instead of using costly animation for the cutscenes, the majority are instead done as freeze frame 3D stills that the camera then slowly sifts through, using dynamic angles and purposely placed obstructions to allow for the scene without you actually seeing them do it. It's a neat idea and I have to applaud the developers for their ingenuity, even if it's a little jarring at times.\n\nI'm not sure how many more ways I can say it at this point; Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death is plain uncomplicated fun. In the same way a dumb summer blockbuster is enjoyable, Marlow doesn't need to be original or perfectly polished to be entertaining. It's a nonsensical adventure that I think almost anyone could enjoy if they can give it a chance, and quite frankly is some of the most fun I've had with any video game in a long time.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","January 30, 2014","true","5.9"," 272 of 300 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","272","300","0","6"

Making use of pretty much all of the popular clichés, the game is filled with mindless over-the-top action, tons of explosions and hilarious puns without ever taking itself seriously at any point.\n\nThe story proves this instantly: Your girlfriend translates ancient scripts for a rich company mogul somewhere in Central America. You visit her and she explains to you how her boss is up to no good because he wants to perform a ritual that would make him a powerful god and ruler of the world. So you try to take here with you back home, which her boss obviously doesn't like, so he gets you killed with an ancient scythe, not knowing that it is imbued with power that resurrects you and summons the Mask of Death, your new companion on your path to rescue your girlfriend and stop the bad boss.\n\nThe game is based on ZootFly's own proprietary, multi-platform engine called ZEN, which doesn't really provide any PC graphics options other than resolution, fullscreen and brightness. That's a shame because the game could've definitely used some AA, which would make the colorful and detailed enviroments look even better than they already do.\n\nWhile the level design as such is pretty linear, which tends to get boring after a while in a lot of games, ZootFly actually managed to add quite a lot of variety to it. Throughout the game you will encounter combat arenas, puzzles, deadly death traps, quick-reaction minigames, turret sequences and even some top-down shoot-em-up action. This sounds like a weird mix of gameplay elements but is incorporated extremely well into the game, so you never have the feeling that it is out of place.\n\nCombat and controls are exactly like what you would expect from a game like this. Throughout the story, you get access to 4 different and upgradable weapons, each of them with a variety of combos to deliver maximum damage. Additionally, by defeating the ancient gods of fire, earth, water and wind, you unlock their devastating ground attacks, which can help you out of tricky situations or simply cause widespread carnage when facing many of the varying enemies at once.\n\nThe puzzle elements in the game mostly consist of moving blocks on trigger platforms or flipping switches to open doors and while they never are overly challenging they actually provide a welcome change to the otherwise extremely fast-paced gameplay, so you can take a short break from all the action.\n\nUsually, with a low-budget title like this, the soundtrack and voice acting are two of the things where the developer tries to save money. Surprisingly enough, the soundtrack is actually pretty decent and, paired with the level design, builds up a really good atmosphere. While the dialogues are a bit cheesy at times, the voice acting itself is good and fits perfectly to the game characters, especially to Marlow and the Mask, who are constantly teasing each other verbally. That makes for some hilarious puns even in the weirdest situations. For example, while you are climbing a stone wall that is about to collapse and kill you, you are arguing with the Mask about who is whose sidekick in this game.\n\nWith around 8 hours of playtime for the story, the game provides an extremely decent bang for the buck and if you want to test your skills further, you can give the Challenge mode a shot where you replay the minigames from the story to achieve better scores and times to rank up in the online leaderboards.\n\nMarlow Briggs and the Mask of Death is cheesy. It's mindless. It's over-the-top action. But that is exactly what makes the game so enjoyable and so much fun and it's great to see some developers going bonkers with their games without trying to be serious, dramatic or mature. If something like this is right up your alley, make sure to check the game out!\n\nOh, did I mention that you can ride giant scorpions in the game?\nBecause you can!\nFRIGGIN' GIANT SCORPIONS!","November 9, 2013","true","7.7"," 69 of 76 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","69","76","0","3"

It is fantastic game in general, let alone the budget price. It has over the top action, which means plenty of explosions and crazy moments like Marlow hanging from a helicopter and he needs to dodge left or right. The game plays great, the graphics are amazing. The camera will zoom out for you to see beautiful vistas, foreboding caverns and giant industrial complexes. There is a scope and scale to this game. You can be so tiny in a grand complex and you feel it. The game really shines with its gameplay diversity. You won't just be hacking and slashing. There are fun turret sections, plenty of not too difficult platform traversal, climbing, swinging, running from boulders, pushing objects, sliding down areas, working turnstile levers and even playing a top down vertical scrolling shooter. These other elements bring a lot of diversity to break up the brawling.\n\nThe story is simple and so bad its good. You're Marlow, visiting his girlfriend in a remote jungle, so she can quit her job working for an evil madman bent on immortality. To show her he means business, he kills you right then and there to kick off the game. Marlow gets killed with a magical artifact and the mask of Death resurrects him. So now with crazy magical powers, Marlow must save his girlfriend. The mask will guide Marlow along the way. There is a lot of humor between Marlow and the mask. Its not a comedy game, but has dabs of humor here and there. Marlow Briggs knows how implausible the situation is and doesn't always take things seriously. The mask is there to aide and taunt Marlow when he dies. To show the game's humor, the antagonist is named Heng Low. He makes some great announcements throughout the game, such as, "all personnel, go grab a gun. There's a nice reward for killing Marlow Briggs. You can use that reward to pay for the weapon rental." Oh and "All employees are fired, please avoid flaming death traps and bottomless pits on your way out."\n\nThe core game play is simple. You can move, double jump, weak attack, strong attack, grapple, block, roll in any direction with the right analog stick, use magic by pressing two buttons and change weapons with the D-pad. Marlow will get four weapons throughout the game. Each weapon has a different speed, range and damage, but for the most part they are pretty much the same. When he attacks he'll swirl around, causing beautiful death. Its visually appealing. There are four spells to earn. A fiery meteor shower in a circle, earth spikes in a straight line, frost to freeze a radius of enemies and a storm. Every enemy gives you experience to upgrade your weapon and magic levels. It seems like every spell depletes all your mana. Luckily each dead enemy brings you health and mana. There is plenty of mana, health and experience around each level. You just need to hold a button to absorb it, so if an enemy is around, they can keep you from getting them. Enemies can be grappled and thrown, but more interesting, they can be converted, making them fight for you! Your block can reflect projectiles if you time it right and you have magical projectiles of your own.\n\nIt is all a nice system, made even more enjoyable by a wide cast of enemies. The standard soldiers don't use guns, just machetes since this is a hack and slash. Rocket launchers that need you to reflect. Riot troops that need to have their shields knocked away with specific attack combos. Bugs that can be easily squashed. There are plenty of mini bosses that show up in the game. First they get their own fight, but then they appear later as common enemies. When most of the mini bosses get weak, you can hop on and control them. Not like the conversion, but rode. You can ride a giant scorpion and control it to kill enemies. You can ride giants the same way. The visual is better than the actual fun. I could kill the enemies a lot quicker without being on top of slow lumbering giants.\n\nSpeaking of giants, then there are the game's big bosses. The bosses so big that you're as tall as a single eye. Each big boss has many parts and they're quite memorable. Its all simple pattern recognition though so its easy enough once you figure out the pattern. The only problem is that you don't do much damage. At the end there is even a quick time event or mash the grapple button.\n\nYou have NO control over the camera. It is always carefully placed and follows you well enough. I only had a problem with that once or twice in the whole game. The load times are hid. I didn't notice one at all unless I came back to a save. Dying has a really quick reload time to the point its just a quote, then you respawn from the last frequent checkpoint. Its so nice to be back in the action.\n\nTo keep things interesting, there are challenges in the game. Things like you're sliding down a hill and need to move left and right. The challenge is collecting all the experience orbs! Don't collect them all? You can restart or just keep playing. You can kill all the helicopters in the turret section or the town down shooter section. It adds an extra level of challenge to what would be an easy game on normal (medium) difficulty. Even though the game stays the same level of difficulty, the later areas just take longer. Bigger enemies take more damage. Puzzles take longer.\n\nOther elements in the game have players jumping between three mine carts to avoid obstacles. Floating with angels wings between platforms. Swimming through a swinging guillotine river. Climbing wall vines, killing worms. Inching with Marlow's back to the wall to avoid either falling or gears. Clinging to cliff sides. Dodging flaming wrecking balls. Turret shooting the pistons on a giant lava scooper as you ride around a cart. Getting chased by helicopters. Seeing giant scorpions get crushed by huge boulders completely unscripted. Escaping under a door by rolling just before spikes crushed the enemies in the room. Fighting enemies on a helipad as it flipped and flew through the air.  Seeing the giant facility Marlow is in was really mobile with treads.\n\nIt all feels like a high budget game in a lot of ways, but lacking in a few, especially the cut scenes. There aren't many animated cut scenes, but the majority of the scenes are fly around of scenes. Its like bullet time. You'll see a still frame circling around Marlow as he's hacked through a flame throwing soldier. As the camera swings around, it will reveal a helicopter. Then Marlow leaping from the copter, only to swing around and show Marlow slashing through an insect.  I'm happy that the cut scenes are the worst part of the game, especially since they're skipable. They spent the time in the animation, character models and gameplay.\n\nThe game is well worth the $5 price tag it currently has. I am shocked this game doesn't have a cult following or more popularity. Even with a 7 hour run time and not too much frills for any replay value, I think this could stand shoulder to shoulder with God of War. The diversity really kept me engaged. Nothing overstayed its welcome. 7 hours was the right time. Its best to leave players wanting more. Odd now Steam says that I only played 5 hours.

To top it off Marlow is a lovable hero unlike that moronic man-child Kratos, and to top it off he's the kind of diverse ethincy video character that AAA games sadly shy away from.\nIn addition, despite being a low budget game, the developers did an EXCELLENT job with some of the scenery and set pieces (check my online album of the game on Steam for some examples).\n\nThe game's plot is simple:\nLo Pan kidnaps Marlow's woman and leaves him for dead by having an ancient scythe weapon lodged onto Marlow's chest. Unbeknownst to Lo Pan, the scythe then resurrects Marlow with the help of an ancient Incan (or Mayan, I forget) King, shown in this game as being a disembodied skull voiced by Steve Blum.\n\nAs Marlow travels to save his love, he gains more weapons and abilities to waste Lo Pan's army and the nightmarish oversized insects and phantoms that get in his way.\n\nI'd recommend playing on Easy, because enemies tend to take a lot of hits before they die on Normal.","June 19, 2014","true","6.3"," 60 of 82 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","60","82","0","1"

I suppose you could compare this game to legends like God of War although it doesn't have the brutality associate with God of War so you won't be tearing your hair in frustration but instead can enjoy this game in peace.\n\nAlong the way witness the dynamic duo of Marlow and the titular Mask of Death as they trade banter while killing enemies, facing monstrous creatures and wielding terrible weapons.\n\nGraphics\nYou probably won't believe how beautiful this game is despite the fact that it merely clocks at 2gb something in terms of size, fauna has a beautiful sheen to it, enemies and environment has beautiful and varied art to them and you will visit many location each [barring the temples] has their own art style and colour.\n\nMusic\nIt's awesome, its  beaty track that fits well with the game and doesn't sound out of place, especially when you face some of the bosses. It's great.\n\nGameplay\nAnd here is where MBATMOD shines the most, you will wield many different [actually just four but they are all different in how they play.] weapons, traverse many different locale and best of all, fight tons of enemies all with satisfying combo.\n\nGranted I don't actually know why its more important to string longer combos since  I don't actually notice any increase in reward but damn I would say its not that hard to pull off 100-200 combos by late game as your skill greatly outclass that of the enemies.\n\nEnemies aren't dull dullard either, they will put up a stiff fight and unless you actually use those combos you will find yourself always running out of health and mana. Fun thing is killing enemies restore the meters albeit very very little. It's a fine system of risk of reward which is greatly enhanced by the fact that healing takes time and you can't just do that in the middle of a brawl with 10+ dudes so caution must be taken. One fun ability they give you in game is the ability to convert humanoid size enemies to your side by grabbing them and spamming the E button. Granted they do die quickly and are usually relegated to meatshield duty but I'll be damn if they didn't save my hide once when I got trapped in an arena with two hulking dudes and 2 never ending spawning enemies, which I proceed to convert naturally.\n\nDid i mention boss fights are aplenty? Yes they are, and they are awesome, you will fight mythical creature, twisted monster and the demons of the underworld itself! Of course cleverly they disguise the mini boss fight as a tutorial segment to deal with the enemy type later.\n\nSo about controls, its very good and responsive. So far none of my button has mispressed. Although one issue with the game is the camera can be a backstabbing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ occasionally, It might swing behind you, in front of you or even block your off-screen view. I guess there has to be a con no?\n\n+Awesome gameplay\n+Killer Graphic\n+Responsive combat and control\n+Great enemies\n+Actually smart AI\n\n+/-Occasional Copypasted levels\n+/-Repetitive levels before the next carrot stick appears\n\n-Terrible Camera\n-The camera, its awful\n\nConclusion\nSo MBATMoD, lets tick the checklist shall we? Great cheesy story, awesome gameplay and enemies and a game that actually understands the meaning of action adventure by shooting you across the world at breakneck speed. I'll give this little bugger a medal and for you I will presribe a  dose of this awesome game.\n\nPRICE THE GAME IS SUPER CHEAP DAMMIT! BUY IT ALREADY!

It's just mindless fun.\nDecent amount of different enemies.\nReally cheap during a Steam Sale.\nCons\nDuring the last third, the game just throws miniboss after miniboss at you, which gets tiring\nLevels are not that well designed. For example, there are losts of safe points where you can attack your enemies but they can't hit you, and sometimes if you're lucky freezing some of them close to a ledge will make them fall even if they aren't supposed to.\nVeredict\nProbably the best paid game you can get on Steam for a dollar or less (during a Sale). Might get a bit repetitive towards the end and you can pretty much beat every fight using just two or three different combos and dodging, but if you're just looking for a fun, cheap God of War-like that doesn't overstay it's welcome, buy this game.","October 28, 2014","true","12.9"," 29 of 34 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","29","34","0","0"

A few glitches but nothing to detract from the entertaining game-play.  The game stays fresh throughout thoughtfully mixing platforming, melee, magic summoning and mini games.   A comedic thread is established early and is maintained as the shirtless black male muscular protagonist frequently converses humorously with a witty spirit of another realm.   The neoteric presentation characterized by an application controlled camera could of been an abject failure but instead provides for some alluring game-play perspectives.

And, I have to admit, it's actually damn fun to play.\n\nMarlow plays like some sort of Devil May Cry or God Of War, but where these other games usually take a little break inbetween the action packed moments Marlow moves full speed ahead. There's hardly ever a dull moment in this game. You move from one crazy action packed scene to the next, with usually just a few seconds of breathing room before hacking away at the next group of enemies.\n\nThis game isn't extremely long, about 5-6 hours, which is more than enough. After finishing it you're probably done with it anyway. It's fun for a first playthrough, then you'll just delete if off your PC most likely. It doesn't have any replay value. Which might actually be the reason why it's just non-stop action.\n\nThe graphics look good, the voice acting is decent and the gameplay solid.\nMarlow Briggs is something you just have to play if you love action games. Especially considering the price these days.\n\n[Rating: 78/100]","November 21, 2013","true","5.9"," 31 of 40 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","31","40","0","0"

The corny acting, the even cornier lines, the dumbed down hack & slash mechanics, and the hilariously stupid plot all serve one thing: to let you have a great time.\n\nLong version:Steam is full of bad games. And while Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death is undoubtedly a bad game, what makes it stand out in the sea of Greenlight schlock is that it was designed to be a bad game: which suddenly elevates it into so-bad-it-is-actually-great status.\nLet me explain.\n\nWhen you play a bad game, you often get frustrated because of bad level design or game mechanics, or bad controls. Or even worse, the game is downright boring. With Marlow Briggs, you will hardly ever get bored: it is a platformer, a hack & slash, a rail shooter, and a shoot ‘em up– all packed into one explosive pack of joy. Sure, some of the platforming levels are repetitive and the camera tends to kill you more than the bosses, but there are so many minigames and shooter sections that you will never, ever get bored.\n\nThe game mechanics are simple as a brick: you have a jump button, normal and a power attack, and a few spells. They form dozens of combos, but they cannot hide the fact that Marlow Briggs is played by mashing two buttons as fast as you can. Combat is strangely satisfying though with good enemy design and one of the most balanced difficulty sliders I saw in a long time.\n\nThe cherry on top of this rather delicious action cake is the story. You cannot name a single 90s action movie cliché or one-liner that isn’t here in some form, and there are more explosions than in Michael Bay’s entire filmography. All completed with a voice acting hammier than a pig farm; it is hilariously terrible and you will probably find yourself unable to not laugh at it, just like how the developers intended.","October 9, 2015","true","16.4"," 31 of 40 people (78%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","78","31","40","6","3"

It is self-aware as can be, knowing it's a lot of nonsense. Marlow is armed with its crazy, ridiculous, and off-the-wall story: Marlow dies and is brought back to life to avenge his death, to save his girlfriend Eva, and stop a corrupt man from trying to rule the world. If that isn't enough - Marlow is constantly making a barrage of in-jokes aimed at video-games in general, action movies + games, and other things of that sort; and tons of non-stop action + explosions. And for most of this action/platforming game - what nonsense it is! Marlow is just tons of fun and will make you grin + smile, most of the time.\n\nMost of the time, constanly running at 60 frames per second on my PC (i7 950; GF GTX 560 Ti; 8 GB RAM; Win 7 64-bit) - Marlow runs extremely well. Very rarely did it even drop below 60! Not only that - but the art-direction + technical graphics are surprisingly actually good here, as well. Marlow's non-stop barrage of action feels fantastic in the controls department with an XBox 360 Controller, playing and feeling very similar to the Darksiders series - which is fantastic! Combat feels + looks smooth, fast, and always is on point! If you're into action-games like the Darksiders (which many feel is similar to God Of War series, which I don't have and haven't played b/c I am a PC gamer) - you'll probably feel right at home with Marlow.\n\nJust when you think you've had your fill of using a certain weapon or skill, expect more to suddenly come your way. Expect a suddeny upgrade to a skill or new game-mechanic introduced. And if this isn't enough - Marlow has mini-games of collecting objects in a race-like manner (which can be compared to on the Leaderboards); and even a mini-heliocopter game that feel like a throwback to Capcom's 1942 + Taito's Sky Shark. Marlow will constantly surprise the player with things like this, from in-jokes to game-references.\n\nIf this sounds up your alley, Marlow is sure to put a lot of cheesy smiles on the face of gamers. That is, until the last few levels come around, when the game decides to severely spike up in difficulty. Regardless, since most of your time spent for the 6-10 hours this campaign should last you (took me a bit longer than 10 hours b/c some areas were a bit frustrating to get though), Marlow is going to deliver a riotous, ridiculous, hilarious, and very fun action-packed roller-coaster ride of a game!\n\nFinal Grade = C+.","October 25, 2014","true","11.7"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","17","19","0","0"

You have everything you can expect from an action movie/game so you just need to sit back and relax while having to face many dangerous creatures and soldiers in order to save the one you love. Marlow never wanted to be a hero, he just want to end all this madness and get his girlfriend back.\n\nYou will have a small variety of weapons and magic tricks that you will learn or get as you progress the game. With simple combos reminding the God of Wars series (without the gory aspect or the budget) you can expect a couples of puzzles as well but they may not represent a challenge if you are a fan of such things. The goal in this game is nothing new or refreshing. Marlow Briggs never taking things too seriously and the plot is really obvious about this. From explosive red barrels that are very well placed to being made fun when you fail a single jump, everything feels like a lot of things you have seen before and there’s nothing wrong with that.\n\nThe game played great without no issues and the visuals are actually quite nice. The colors are bright and vibrant and there’s a decent balance between those levels around the forest and the industrial area. I finished the game in around 6 hours and I had a decent amount of fun. It was a game that made right from the start that did not wanted to being taken seriously and they achieved that goal without flinching. If you like to play more than one game at the time and you are playing something horror related or very story heavy, Marlow Briggs is just the right thing to play between such titles.\n\nSilliness is guaranteed as well mindless fun.\n","June 7, 2015","true","6.2"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","13","16","0","0"

And to be clear, the graphics are a little sloppy, the game-play is straight out of God of War, the "plot" is B-movie fluff, and there are no Steam trading cards for this title. On the other hand...\n\nMarlow Briggs is AMAZING! It completely embraces the cheesiness of its premise, and delivers absurdly over-the-top action on a scale unheard of in most video games. Through it all the protagonist delivers a ton of action movie one-liners and amusing meta-commentary on the number of puzzles involving spikes, swinging blades, and fire. Instead of long, boring cut-scenes, we get cool "freeze frame" moments, with the camera swooping and panning around the frozen tableau as Marlow Briggs defeats an army of giant bugs, or cuts a helicopter in half, or survives the explosion of a cruise-ship-sized mining vehicle. It's also nice to see a black guy as the protagonist, with no one else in the game making a big deal out of it.\n\nThere is nothing new or original in this package, so don't expect it to change the definition of gaming.

Reminded me of something Nick Cage might do.\n\nThis is an over the top character action game with all the tropes and mechanics you've come to expect. X and Y weak/strong attacks strung into combos. 4 different weapons types. Standard med speed/med damage/med range(sword type), fast/short range/med damage(dagger type), fast/long range/low damage(chain type) and Slow/low range/high damage(hammer type). As well as elemental magic attacks. Though these do more or less the same thing except the ice one. Powerful AOE attack.\n\nIts got block puzzles, its got platforming, ledge grabbing, timed based swings and jumps. It also has a really weird and out of place vertically scrolling shooter that happens more than once.\n\nThe banter between the main character and the mask that gives the character powers is actually funny at times and very self aware. It never really gets in the way or become annoying.\n\nIt's paced pretty well, at the end it drags a little (but only a little). Maybe it over stays its welcome by a small unit of measurement. If it were maybe 4-5 hours long it'd be perfect. 6 or more if you're a completionist seems just enough to make me mention the length might be an issue.\n\nIt's more inspired by God of War mechanically but the aesthetics are pretty much Uncharted with some industrial zones. Even down to the Health Orbs being red, magic orbs being blue and XP orbs being gold/yellowish. Not to mention the right analog "push in direction to roll that way dodge)\n\nDecent romp and palate cleanser, especially for $5.","January 23, 2015","true","5.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

It has everything you want in a game and MORE, much more: evil mercenaries, flame throwers, giant scorpions, sorcerers, helicopters, explosions (A LOT of explosions) and a blade on a chain. It is an 80s fantasy action movie incarnate, a cross between Golden Axe, God of War and Prince of Persia: Sands of Time, where the main hero is a combination of The Rock and Samuel L.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/geoluz/recommended/249680/","geoluz","GeoLuz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/geoluz/","180 products in account","Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death is the equivalent of a B-movie from the 1980s and 1990s. It is so bad it is good. It is clearly a low budget game that is not a breakthrough for the game industry or the game’s genre. However, this game provides plenty of fun from the beginning. The gameplay feels varied enough as you traverse different settings in the same country and the action never lets up.\n\nMarlow Briggs is a smokejumper who goes on vacation outside the U.S. to a Spanish speaking country. I initially thought it was Mexico, but it could have been Central or South America based on the jungles and the rich history of the indigenous people. He is with his girlfriend, an archeologist who is kidnapped by an Asian madman, Heng Long, with godlike magical powers who seems bent on taking over the world. This madman kills Marlow Briggs with a mythical weapon, but he is reborn by a Mayan mask proclaiming him to be the sacred warrior who must save the sacred land. Long is backed up by an army of mercenaries of varying levels of difficulty. Marlow goes to fight to save the land for the Mayan mask and to save his girlfriend. It becomes apparent that this plot is formulaic and unoriginal but this game can get away with it because of its X factor: entertainment value.\n\nOnce Marlow goes to work the plot takes a backseat and the real fun begins. Marlow begins with the same weapon used to kill him. It has short range, but it cuts good. The gameplay seems to borrow elements from the Tomb Raider series and God of War. The mercenaries may seem repetitive at times, but it does not detract from the fun that combat provides. The Mayan mask becomes Marlow’s sidekick, cracking cheesy jokes along the way. While the combat is mainly melee Marlow is introduced to magic spells that require full or near full levels of mana. There are red masks for health regeneration and blue masks for mana regeneration. The red and blue masks are generously placed in areas of intense combat. Therefore, it is easy to regenerate health and mana after the combat is over. There are also new weapons to use that slice better and have more range than the first weapon of the game. Sometimes Marlow sounds like an action hero from a cheesy action film when fighting saying things like “Aw yeah, class is in session.” His acrobatics are well animated, whether in combat or jumping from one section to another.\n\nThere are many bosses that Marlow Briggs must face. I think they are quite impressive and require you to figure out their moves so that you can best fight them without taking damage in return. The boss fights seem to ensure that you put as much importance in your defensive moves as you do in your offensive moves. It becomes important to damage your toughest foes without taking so much damage in return. The battles with the ordinary mercenaries are the ones that feel a little repetitive as you advance through the game. The animations of all the mercenaries are impressive and look realistic.\n\nThere are platforming aspects to this game, much like the Tomb Raider games. There are plenty of puzzles, some timed whereas others are not timed. Some puzzles require you to jump around a lot to reach the next destination. Other puzzles require you to move boxes to open doors or gain access to boxes that can lead to higher levels. The puzzles are really none too complicated to solve. There sceneries are not the best in terms of graphics, but they are respectable with enough detail to look realistic, especially for a low budget game. Eventually, Marlow will be able to glide (fly) from one platform to another since double jumps will not always be good enough. There is also a break in the melee action when Marlow is required to shoot stationary guns to shoot down choppers. There are also challenges that require you to shoot down aircraft in top-down style.\n\nThe one gripe I have about this game is the fixed camera angles. The camera angles are inflexible and awkward as they do not allow for much viewing freedom. This can lead to some frustrations such as jumping and falling to your death. Eventually, I got over the problem with these camera angles. It feels like an unrefined aspect of this game, but it is not so bad that it would ruin the game. The developers at ZootFly can sure use tips from Crystal Dynamics, the developers of Tomb Raider, on how to best apply camera angles in a game that features platform jumping and puzzle solving. Also, there are times when the camera obstructs your view when fighting two very large Juggernauts of Chabtan. One comes after me while I can’t see what the other one is doing.\n\nI think Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death deserved more popularity than it got. It is a solid action game with plenty of fun gameplay that never reaches boredom. I recommend this game to anyone. At a price of $4.99 you cannot go wrong with this game.\n\nMy Score: 7/10\n","April 8","true","42.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death provides one of the most cinematic and moving moments in the  entire history of video games that I won't dare spoil. Here's a hint, though: Marlow is forced to choose between his love of futbol and the security of the Patriots project. Which will he choose?\n\nCitizen Kane? More like Citizen Lame. Buy Marlow Briggs.","August 5, 2014","true","1.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","75","6","8","4","0"

As the description of the game says: "Fight the asian menace!", which obviously refers to the gigantic "Anime" monopoly the asians lavish in, whose market they're trying to push into the virgin and lush lands of South America, and use the vast riches found there to produce radioactive enriched anime tapes and manga books to attack the innocent citizens of America. Thus the main character has to stop their plans and make them fall back into their foxholes in Iwo Jima by showing them how a third nuke would've been.\n\nThe gameplay is an excellent example of how western companies should battle eastern developers with combat mechanics that not only rival, but are hundreds of times better than the so overrated eastern rpgs like Dark Souls. The players has to fight back deadly banzai charges performed by over-zeaoulous japanese samurai guerrillas and mutated beasts product of the secret nuclear experiments in Fukushima.","June 24, 2014","true","0.3"," 19 of 34 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","19","34","0","2"

This is a great hack and slash in the same style as God of War, but in an action movie motif that screams 'Big Trouble in Little China' homage. Much like the 80s film, the hero (who may be the sidekick depending on opinion) is thrust into saving his girlfriend from the villain, voiced by James Hong who is once again typecast as the asian man who's trying to use a girl for a crazy ritual.\n\nThere's four weapons and four magic spells you can use. All of which level up quite quickly in the somewhat basic upgrade menu. What's a game without a tacked on upgrade system, mirite? It's not bad, but it has no fancy skill trees or anything.\n\nThe writing isn't the best, but it is entertaining. Especially the dialogue between Marlow and the floating Mayan mask he talks to. The voices are good in the sense that they're over the top and fit the style that the game is going for.\n\nThe pacing is great. A nice mix of platforming, combat, puzzles, wall climbing, sliding, and on rail shooting. They're spread out to keep things interesing as you progress. The combat itself is also pretty good. It doesn't feel sloppy or cheap. Good PC hack and slash titles are few and far between and this is one that I'm glad I got to play.\n\nIt's totally worth a purchase and playthrough.","April 1, 2014","true","8.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I clicked on Marlow Briggs just for the heck of it, expecting to see tons of negative reviews...... but they were pretty much all positive, and said the game was like God of War, but for (during Summer Sale right now) 99 cents. I bought it immediately.\nIt's a fantastic game. It has amusing characters like Marlow and the Mexican god who guides him. There's Long, the villain, and  Marlow Brigg's assassin who teams up with him during his afterlife. The plot is average, but doesn't matter much in this type of game. You can tell production budget was somewhat low, but they still managed to get moments that are far more epic than $60 shooters. The graphics are fair and some of the views (such as of ancient temples and towns, plus the factory) are beautiful. It is like God of War in every way, and that is a good thing. You get new weapons as you go along, and you can upgrade these weapons. With new weapons comes new moves and more options during combat. You also get new mega-powers, such as summoning a hailstorm of lava or creating a blizzard that freeze enemies. Along with weapons and powers, you also get to fight new enemies with harder and harder difficulty. In addition, there are many different environments and fun mini games to play. Did I mention you can save whenever you want?\nThis game is 99 cents during sale, and it is worth every penny.

Now, bump it up to Hardcore and you're in for a challenge, except I'm now wondering if I had figured how to get the game to switch weapons sooner (Tab key doesn't work for me, I had to use the individual number keys), if it would've been easier. There is also a serviceable amount of platforming and puzzle-solving, though nothing any seasoned player will be stuck on for very long (with maybe an exception here or there).\n\nAnyway, the game is fast-paced, action-packed, and has lots of explosions and goofball banter between the main character and his floating Mayan mask spirit helper, and just about every action game cliche that's been invented in the past decade - bullet time, QTEs, slow-mo special moves, massive combo attacks, mini-game sequences - you name it, it's probably in here. Once you're past the factory settings near the beginning and into the Mayan jungles, it becomes one feast for the eyes after another (screenshots do not do it justice).\n\nThe game frequently goes on sale for around $1-$3, and if God of War clones or action games in general are your thing, I can easily recommend it for that. Even the current store price of $5 isn't a bad deal for it, but since I found it easy, I imagine that people who are more used to playing games of this genre than me might blow through it quickly, even on Hardcore.\n\nRating: 3.5/5","September 8, 2014","true","25.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game's pace is frantic and non-stop from beginning to end switching you between combat sequences, platforming, rail shooting, sliding sequences and even SHUMP sections with the only lull being the games three puzzles.\n\nThe game looks surprisingly good for its $15 price tag with some notable backdrops looking really impressive, combat animations that flow nicely and a solid framerate throughout its entirety. However animations in the few cutscenes that are actually fully animated look really janky and awkward which is probably why they opted to do panning/ stop motion type sequences for most of their cutscenes which are unique and work quite well.\n\nWhere the game really shines though is its dialogue and sense of humor which is as plentiful and quickly paced as everything else in this game.\n\nIf you enjoy character action games or humorous over the top action stories you will definitely want to check this out.","January 4, 2014","true","6.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Then again, at least it's not a puzzle platformer! Honestly though, Marlow Briggs isn't all that bad as long as you don't mind the linearity.\n\nI have to say I have absolutely no idea where Marlow Briggs comes from, whether it's a franchise of some sorts or simply a new IP. What I do know is that it features a badass-looking African-American main character full of buff and somewhat lacking in smarts. As it happens Mr. Briggs decided to drop in an visit his sweetheart at the dig site where she works, spend some quality holiday time together. As it also happens, his sweetheart works for an unscrupulous mafia boss hell-bent on becoming a god. What follows is a standard man rescues woman plot, though in this case it's filled with cheesy jokes and commentary from the characters as well as lots of over-the-top action and destruction. Think 90's action movies maybe - big unbelievable machines, lots of explosions, and an evil mastermind who just can't help commenting on the main character's progress (and his own failures).\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=197082945\n\nIn terms of game mechanics there isn't all that much here that hasn't been done before. Lots of running and jumping and avoiding various implements of death, a significant number of speed slaloming sections too. A few puzzles involving pressure-plates and levers too, though they're pretty easy to grasp and rather annoying to execute at times. A lot of those are also timer-based which only makes it more frustrating. Possibly to compensate for this there are a few turret sections and some top-down plane shmup sections too.\n\nCombat is based on combos composed of light and heavy attack mixes, though I have to give credit to the ingame combo tutor. In more detail there are 4 weapons that cover the usual variety - a standard balanced weapon, a set of daggers with high speed but low attack, a whip with massive range and rate of attack but even lower attack, and a massive scythe that probably should've been a sledgehammer given its slow but devastating attack. On top of that there are 4 types of magic - Fire, Earth, Water, and Wind - and a quickfire homing magic missile. Creep-wise there are several standard varieties - including but not limited to shield-bearers, heavies, giants, gunners, or huge scorpions - sadly those feel more like a chore past the few initial encounters. Every now and then a boss comes along (5 times, to be precise) and things get more entertaining.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=193176104\n\nVisually it's a decent offering, the models look plenty detailed and the environments are rich and vibrant. And I really mean this - initially there are massive excavation machines that resemble moving fortresses more than anything and later on lots of ruins and jungle and mountains. Maybe the textures don't hold up to AAA games upon closer inspection but overall there's nothing to complain about.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=226996285\n\nAnimation-wise there doesn't seem much to complain about, attacks look smooth and interrupts are more than an instant transition to a hit pose. Of particular note is the unusual style that some of the cutscenes are done it - stop-motion frames! It's kinda like what Batman: Arkham Asylum/City did - a series of snapshots of a 3D scene brimming with action an momentum. Hard to describe but pretty successful.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=192811453\n\nNow on the audio side things are not as pretty though. There are a TON of dialogues and voiced chatter, and it's not the worst it could be. The main character actually sounds pretty decent, as does the main villain. However, I personally had issues and very few voice-overs actually played. If it wasn't for the subtitles I'd have no idea someone was talking.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=231662424\n\nThe only other big gripe I had with this title was the camera. I found the camera mighty awkward most of the time and there is no way to actually adjust the camera manually! This ties in into finding hidden bonuses and collectibles I suppose but those are few and far between to actually warrant that. And it's not like the camera actually follows behind at all times, nope, the angle seems to be pre-defined in most zones/areas/corridors.\n\n\nInitially I wasn't sure I'd stick through to the end. I've seen TotalBiscuit's WTF Is.. on Marlow Briggs and got hooked. Then I fired it up and noticed the missing voice-overs. And this somewhat killed the mood for me. With the voice overs (and given their frequency) the game would've been pretty engaging, as it was it turned into a rather mundane experience. Nevertheless, Marlow Briggs is a decent enough action adventure - as long as you're not expecting too much. Darksiders or DmC this is not, after all.","February 25, 2014","true","12.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

Perhaps this game.  Admitedly its similarities with batman are only its slick combat, combo, weapons and powers system though without that the batman games are mostly just cool set pieces.  It picks up alot of tomb raider vibes in its well done platforming and puzzles etc.  What this game also has is a ♥♥♥♥ load of b-movie humour delivered by Steve Blum as the ancient aztec death mask who really does some of his finest work in this game.\n\nThis game also has a failry unique setting besides the ancient ruins in the shape of monsterous industrial machines, facilities that blanket the jungle regions, like the keystone pipeline with a penchant for outofthisworld steroids.  The games weapon and power progression is straightforward and matches the slick gameplay.  This is probably in the top 10 platformers/beat-em-ups i've ever played though admittedly my console days are long behind me.  Still this game actually works perfectly fine with mouse and keyboard, though i could see some preferring to use a controller.\n\nThe games humour and slick combat and platforming though are why people should play this game, and based on the nearly all positive steam reviews I'm not alone.  Also at around 6 hours or so its a nice diversion from other game types.  It was also just another amusement to peruse the achivements and notice an achievement for skipping all in game cutscenes in a single playthrough...oh game.

There are also limited puzzles,\nand a few turret sections.  The music, while respectable, was not used appropriately\nto emphasize action or atmosphere as you progress through the game.  There are\nleaderboards for those that enjoy them, and challenge areas that require a different\nstyle of combat both to change up the standard hack and slash feel, and to offer\na harder level of difficulty for those looking to increase their leaderboard rankings.\n\nThe graphics look good, and the story is decent,\nwith eclectic comedic aspects that come off as more corny than the game was trying for.\nThe game doesn't take itself too seriously, which is good, but it has clung to certain\nstereotypes such as "rescue the princess" that are overdone in many adventure games.\n\nThe level design is vast and impressive, but there is a certain suspension of\ndisbelief required in the physics.   Some may find no fault in a full on battle while\nflying through the air, but most would probably question how the characters aren't\nthrown to their deaths.  The platforming is where this game excels in content.\nThey are designed very well, and you will spend more time platforming through the world\nthan doing anything else. There is a major problem with the camera angle, however, making it\ndifficult to see distances when platforming, and seeing enemies due to the angle.  it\ntakes away from the immersion into the game, and requiring memorization of challenges\nrather than going with the flow of the adventure.  I go more in depth into this\nproblem in the video for those that would like a visual example.\n\nThe combat in the game falls short of what it could be;  the weapons all\nessentially do the same thing, with differences in range or speed.  As you progress\nthrough the game, the enemies require more button smashing to defeat rather than any\ntactics or response to their abilities.  There are spells in the game, but they all\ncost an excessive amount of mana, couldn't be used often, and have little effect or\ndamage to the enemy, taking away from the fluidity of the game.\n\nThe game has good graphics, but has a lot of issues.  The story doesn't propel\nyou forward, and doesn't encourage an emotional connection.  The battles lack fluidity\nand the camera view makes it more repetitive than immersive.  I never felt the game\nwas wasting my time, but I felt it was more boring than challenging.  You spend more\ntime platforming through the world than in combat.  If you expect more from games, then\ngood chance you will not enjoy this game, but if you are easily amused then this should\nbe good enough for you to enjoy.\n\nFor more details, see the linked video review, as this is a basic summary of\nwhat I cover in my video.\n\nThanks for your viewership and support for more videos check click here.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho","November 20, 2014","true","8.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Inspired (very, very heavily.  Like, "watch out for copyright lawsuits" heavily) by God of War 2, a game already known by all men with booming voices, beards, and indescribable road rage, this is the tale of Marlow Briggs.  See, Marlow isn't just your regular old barrel-chested he-man.  He fights fires.  Not to be confused with spraying water on burning buildings, no.  Before you have ever even picked up the controller, Marlow Briggs has had a history of going mano-e-mano with towering pillars of flame.  Fists only.  No items.  Final Destination.  By the time your dainty, effeminate hands have laid themselves down on the controller (play it with a controller, it's a console type of action game), he has had sexual intercourse with more women than you have ever seen, including your mother and all of your sisters over the age of 18, though the underage ones still jill off to him.  Over the course of the next few hours, you will direct his wrath at a menagerie of mercenaries and Aztec horrors all over a Central American jungle.  Even though I was already an adult male, this game put me through a second, much stronger puberty.  My testicles dangle like anvils with a sweater on them, my booming voice shatters windows and sends girly men screaming to the ground, and my muscles got so big that even wearing a muscle shirt still costs the GDP of a small African country.

Lip synching isn't the best, bust graphics are bright and fun, matching the over the top atmosphere. Explosions about, and everything just works. Some environments are repetitive, and there could be more enemy variety, but what does exist really does feel like a nice jungle/industrial vide well. Overall pretty if not exceptional graphics. One note, probably due to budget, not all cutscenees are fully rendered, but instead play out in comic book style action frames. They look good and convey the action well, but would have been so much more epic in real time.\n\n+/- Sound and voice work is mostly competent, if pretty flat. No stadouts here at all. Better maybe than what you'd expect for a $5 game, but nothing more. Explosions and combat sounds are good though. Again, nothing exceptional but fit the game well. Only thing would have made it better is if either Marlow, or the villian, Mr. Long, were better done to fully match the cheesy 80's vibe.\n\n+/- Story is pure 80's cheese and I mean that in the best way possible. Everything is exploding, you are kicking ♥♥♥ and throwing puns, your mask sidekick mocks you when you die, and the bad guy absurdly sets up why everything is basically a deathtrap. This isn't a good story. It's clinche and dumb as hell. But it's fun.\n\n+/- Combat, being the core of the game, is mostly well done. Learning to dodge and block, switching up between your varied attacks, and using combo's is the name of the game. We aren't talking Bayonetta or DMC level of complexity, but it works well. Movements are sometimes a bit sluggesh however, most noticably during some "challeges" where even on missed jump means instant death. Despite those "Challenge" sections, I found the game to be pretty responsive.\n\nIf you are looking for big, brash, stupid, 80's action movie style gameplay that is just fun. Look no further. For $5 bucks or less, you simply can't go wrong. Happily give it a 4/5 due to it just being stupidly fun and a steal when on sale.","January 10, 2015","true","6.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Take all the cheese of 80s action movies, add the bravado and humour of those as well and you can pretty much describe Marlow Briggs.\n\nIt's a nice game when you just want to beat something up. Sure it's a budget title, and it shows at times with some questionable camera positions in a couple of places, as well as enemies which show up a bit too often near the middle of the game.\n\nThe jungle landscapes do look rather nice, the stop motion action sequences do a really good job of capturing the over the top action of some of the 80s action movies, without having to actually animate it. The combat is satisfying with your standard light attack, heavy attack, block and dodge rolls. Some rather good platforming segments and other action segments break up the game from being just beating up enemies.\n\nIt doesn't do much wrong. It's not exceptional either, but as a budget title it's a quite enjoyable time. Just make sure you play with a gamepad.","October 6, 2014","true","5.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's refreshing to play a game that doesn't star yet another white guy with ambiguous motives. You play an every man trying to rescue his lady friend and defeat a flamboyant and merciless guy hellbent on destruction. I think one of my favorite aspects of this game is that, while the story could have been nothing due to the game mechanics being fun and tight feeling, it actually paints a really compelling picture. You can tell via the voice acting and writing that Marlow really cares about his significant other and vice versa. Other larger budget games often attempt to make you feel something when it comes to romantic interests/sub plots but this is one of the first that actually had me invested in their relationship.\n\nThe game mechanics are great. I really enjoy the fixed camera despite it being something that I haven't liked since Silent Hill 2 and it allows you to use your other thumbstick (I use a PS3 controller) to roll and evade making the combat even more refreshing. The difficulty also doesn't let up despite your character getting better weapons as you progress which keeps the game fresh and non-repetitive.\n\nI think the only negative mark I've found so far is that due to the fixed camera, there will be times where you make a move the game doesn't fully anticipate and the camera will float into space, causing you to restart from your last checkpoint. This has only happened twice and I can see how it could happen based on what actions I was trying to accomplish. Aside from that minor issue, the game is solid and it cost me less than a croissant.\n\nA+","June 25, 2014","true","4.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's refreshing to play a game that doesn't star yet another white guy with ambiguous motives. You play an every man trying to rescue his lady friend and defeat a flamboyant and merciless guy hellbent on destruction. I think one of my favorite aspects of this game is that, while the story could have been nothing due to the game mechanics being fun and tight feeling, it actually paints a really compelling picture. You can tell via the voice acting and writing that Marlow really cares about his significant other and vice versa. Other larger budget games often attempt to make you feel something when it comes to romantic interests/sub plots but this is one of the first that actually had me invested in their relationship.\n\nThe game mechanics are great. I really enjoy the fixed camera despite it being something that I haven't liked since Silent Hill 2 and it allows you to use your other thumbstick (I use a PS3 controller) to roll and evade making the combat even more refreshing. The difficulty also doesn't let up despite your character getting better weapons as you progress which keeps the game fresh and non-repetitive.\n\nI think the only negative mark I've found so far is that due to the fixed camera, there will be times where you make a move the game doesn't fully anticipate and the camera will float into space, causing you to restart from your last checkpoint. This has only happened twice and I can see how it could happen based on what actions I was trying to accomplish. Aside from that minor issue, the game is solid and it cost me less than a croissant.\n\nA+","June 25, 2014","true","4.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Less than a buck for a game that's pretty much a action comedy meets God of War. Some of the puzzles are annoying but not impossible. The cut scenes are unique "evolving" freeze frames which is a nice touch. Yes there are glitches, just a week ago I tried to jump up onto something I thought was a reachable ledge to maybe a hidden item. Instead, I jumped up and went into the mountain side and Marlow just kept up this long horizontal jump into the void. But who cares!

The Mask cracks jokes when Marlow is killing enemies and makes fun of him when he dies.\n\nI only had one problem, sometimes when trying to grab a rope or ladder you would miss.

Zootfly has managed to clone God of War into a game that is actually better than God of War, with a more interesting (albeit more racist) protagonist in a more creative setting and plot. The gameplay is fantastic, with a character action-based style of liner gameplay, and four very fun movesets based on the weapons you unlock, each with it's own set of satisfying combos. The environments convey an enormous sense of scale, and the camera tricks you into thinking things look much bigger than they are. The environments are very surprisingly gorgeous at times, and the graphics on the PC are surprisingly fantastic. The action is awesome and very over-the-top, with an increase in scale and buildup that rivals that of Platinum's action games, and the fighting levels are broken up by decently lengthy minigames throughout, including an on-rails shooter boss battle and a shoot-em-up helicopter section. Even the end credits are a minigame (which sure beats most credits sequences in terms of enjoyability!). The characters are just developed and fun enough to make a VERY STUPID, yet enjoyable and decently funny story, and the main villain, (also extremely racist) is a very satisfying enemy to face in the final boss battle. At 5 dollars, this is some of the best value you can get form a Steam game purchase, and it's a game that will offer you significant enjoyment no matter who you are. Trust me, this game stands out.

It has an extremely self-aware over-the-top action movie feel and doesn't take itself at all seriously; most of the "dramatic" action sequences are laugh out loud funny. Also does a great job with pacing, keeping you interested and action-packed throughout.","December 22, 2014","true","5.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For me, what stops this title from being really great, is the fact that the devs chose to use frozen frame, panning dioramas in place of cutscenes in many places. Bad call in my opinion - it COMPLETELY breaks any feeling of immersion, while also slowing down the action to snails pace, and it doesn't do a good job of keeping the story interesting.\n\nFun, Yes.

It's a stupid hack-and-slash with no depth that succeeds because it keeps the pace up and constantly changes what you're doing. It has a dumb-as-rocks story that involves Marlow Briggs, a Regular Guy (TM) getting killed by an Evil Genius (TM) and then being resurrected to take on said Evil Genius by Aku Aku from Crash Bandicoot.\n\nFrom there it's 6-8 hours of slashing and platforming and rail shooting. You don't do any one thing for too long so it doesn't get boring.\n\nThe only issue I have with the game is some of the late game boss fights, which fall into the trap of going like this: dodge to avoid boss's slow attack, dodge in and hit boss once or twice, dodge back out, repeat. This would be fine except that many of the bosses have really large health pools, so, while it's not hard to beat them because you can easily avoid their attacks, the battles do test your patience. This is just bad game design. If I've figured out the trick to beating the boss, let me beat the boss already! Don't make me do the trick 40 times, I already understand it!\n\nOther than that it's good if you want something with that dumb 80s action movie feel.\n\nPerformance note: this game has a couple of annoying, but not game-breaking, technical problems.\n\nFirst, my audio drivers crashed every single time I quit the game, resulting in that loud buzzing noise that you get when your drivers crash. I had to restart the computer to get the noise to stop. Not a huge deal since I beat this in 3 sittings, but it is annoying. I have a dedicated Asus Xonar soundcard and I haven't noticed anyone else complaining about this problem, so it might just be my setup. YMMV.\n\nSecond, this game respects the Windows display scaling when it shouldn't. What I mean is, I have my computer hooked up to a 43" TV and I sit about 7 feet away, so I have to set text and apps to 150% size in Windows display settings to make things readable. When I run Marlow Briggs with display scaling set to 150%, the game's menus and HUD increase as well and run off the side of the screen. So I had to toggle my Windows display scaling every time I booted the game up. I haven't noticed any other games that do this, so it makes me think that 505 Games just doesn't know what they're doing.","February 8","true","8.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

ASTOUNDINGLY LOW THAT IS OOOOOOOOHHHH (see? I can write unfunny jokes, too).\n\nAt first, its actually a fun game: action, 'splosions, dumb one-liners, what more could you want from a game like this? But oh boy does it get old fast. This game really has it all and then doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥ about any of it: not about its action, not about its characters (which IS important - don't tell me Arnie isn't a cool character in everything he's in), and least of all about its originality.\n\nWhat killed the game for me was not just the immense level of copypasting off of God of War - although it really is so immense that it's not even funny any more: every single game mechanic from fighting to dodging, blocking, running, climbing, chain swinging, block pushing, orb collecting etc. was aped - but the fact that none of it was copied competently. The puzzles are insultingly easy, the stylized cutscenes (that were taken from the first GoW) are painfully slow and boring, the story itself is horrendously dull even for a game like this and the combat just didn't cut it. At one point, I accidently turned off my monitor during a fight and I decided to just humor the game - attempt the combat with the screen off. Yup, killed them all, no ♥♥♥♥♥ given.\n\nThe moment you receive the Chains of Olympus weapon was the moment the developers found even more ♥♥♥♥♥ to not give and did not even try hiding any more how blatantly they copied God of War. Half an hour later I heard the most forced and lamest tentacle porn joke in the history of hentai, and I suppose at that point you can guess what I refused to give.\n\nI feel like an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ not recommending this game at this price but I just can't. Only buy this if you are willing to get no more than 30 minutes of fun from this game or you are really capable of ignoring absolutely all of your standards. The game gets cut a lot of slack for being silly (and dirt cheap), but I didn't find it was possible to oversee how few ♥♥♥♥♥ the developers gave about any of this. I was prepared (and hyped!) for a B-game à la God Hand, but there is just no soul in this. As if the developers went out of their way to not give a ♥♥♥♥.\n\nThe game is also a bit racist, but not to a level where I would consider it offensive.

He has also done a insane amount of other movies and voice-overs, including work in Diablo 3.\n\nThe game loads up and just starts right away. No menu, nothing, just begins with the opening sequence. But it is automatically set at my resolution and refresh rate with vsync on which blows my mind that this obscure game can do that and hardly any other game can. I ALWAYS have to check res and vsync first thing in any game I ever start up for the first time. So hats off to this game for that, golf clap.\n\nThis first thing you will immediately notice within the first ten seconds is that your guy has a serious medical condition: his veins in his arms bulge out so much that they exist completely on the outside of his arms. No doubt they were trying to make him look ripped and badass but no man I have ever seen has veins that bulge to a point of being external. Hopefully I come across a medical clinic soon in the game to have that fixed or pick up a health pack or something.\n\nBy far the best deal and fun-to-dollar ratio of any game I have ever bought on steam. It was only 99 cents and it is a very good AAA game that was overlooked when it was released. It is a rail action game, meaning you do not control the camera, it just moves with you as you go along in the game. It actually works fine too this way. It's the same rail action as a game like Narco Terror. The gameplay is solid and flows nicely, and is much akin to the God of War games. The graphics are great, the entire game looks very good. Very vibrant with awesome effects. The story is instantly forgettable. If I want a good story I will play a RPG or read a book. The last place I would ever look for a good story is a action game, and there are very few exceptions.\n\nIt is really amazing that I found this gem on sale for only a dollar. If you are an action game fan there is no reason you should not like this unless you are ignorant. Since most players on steam play garbage like DayZ, then you probably already are dumb beyond words. It really is a pretty fun and well done solid game. 8/10","July 2, 2014","true","2.7"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Even some of the canned wisecracks were sort of funny.\nAbout two thirds of the way in, however, the difficulty spikes and the fights become a real chore - you're constantly dodging out of the way and never get to use any of the neat combos the game has spent the past few hours teaching you. Some of the jumping sections are also pretty obnoxious, with checkpoints set way too far back. The camera is not manually controllable, and whilst it usually does a decent job of being in the right place can be annoying when you just want to look around and work out a puzzle or plan a jump. There is a manual save function which can mitigate some of the frustration if you notice and remember to use it.\n\nWhilst the game certainly has its good points - the art is pretty cool, and the fights are fun at first - I found it too frustrating and with too many cheap-feeling deaths to get a recommendation. If you have a slightly masochistic streak and don't mind trying the same jump over and over, maybe this would suit you.","May 11, 2014","false","11.1"," 21 of 41 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","21","41","0","0"

Enemies are varied as are locations. Boss battles are quite lame, but brief.\n\nThe game makes no premises about what it is and is filled with self-parody and stupidity all the way through it's "story". Cutscenes and characters are laughably plastic and the game even has an achievement for skipping all cutscenes, which I thoroughly recommend on "achieving". 5-6 hours of fun and enjoyable combat and great colourful levels, supplemented by dumb and hilarious commentary of a talking Mayan mask are definitely worth this game's asking price.\n\n"If only there was a conveniently-placed AA gun for me to deal with all these helicopters..."","July 14, 2014","true","9.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You have light and heavy attacks creating different combinations, blocks to reflect enemy projectiles, dodging, and magic.\n\n+4 different weapons and magic to fit your play style\n\n+ Throughout the game you will visit interesting locations each providing its own unique action set pieces. The game does a good job of varying up the gameplay to a certain degree to keep things interesting.\n\n+easy achievements\n\n+The game is short but I consider that pretty good for this game because it doesn't wear out its welcome, it does everything it sets out to do.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- The game itself is very competently made, however its biggest "flaw" is that it is very unoriginal. God of War came out before this game and does just about everything better in every category. This is the biggest clone of God of War I have ever seen, from the combat to the platforming to the moves. This in itself isn't bad as many games copy each other however this game brings absolutely nothing new to the table. I know you should judge a game on its own merits but its highly obvious the developers looked at God of War and re-skinned it.\n\n- The story is an afterthought and serves as an excuse for you to kill lots and lots of enemies. After the first 5 minutes of the game the entire story is laid out before you. It doesn't help that the dialogue is terrible.\n\n- Every character in the game is generic, its hard to care about anyone in the game\n\n- Outside of combat the platforming and controls can be a bit flaky at times.\n\nConclusion\n\nIf you are looking for a fun mindless action game, then look no further, given the price of the game this is probably one of the better values you will find. If you enjoyed God of War then you should check this game out as its the closest thing you're going to play on steam.\n","October 17, 2014","true","12.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It's a pretty standard formula of action adventure games akin to the likes of Darksiders, God of War, and Devil May Cry, and it might do everything that's been done before, but it does so very well and manages to stay fun throughout.\n\nThe gameplay is nicely balanced between combat sections, platforming, puzzles, and mini-games. You're never doing the same thing for too long, which keeps the experience fresh and entertaining. As you progress through the game, your weapon acquires different forms (scythe, twin daggers, whip, and hammer), which are useful in different situations and you can switch between them at any time. In addition you also learn some very powerful spells which are good at clearing out large crowds of enemies.\n\nOverall the difficulty I felt was balanced perfectly. There were no unexpected difficulty spikes and most of it was a smooth ride. In the last quarter of the game it gets a bit challenging, but it does so gradually and reasonably. Only one section involving a certain collapsing underground bridge felt a bit cheap since it gave me a lot of insta-deaths, but that section was pretty short.\n\nI really enjoyed most of the mini-games, such as the first-person shooting sections where you have to mount a turret and shoot down helicopters, or even flying one yourself, or sliding down the cliffs and dodging obstacles. No overcomplicated mechanics. Just simple and fun mini-games to give you a small break from fighting and platforming.\n\nThe plot is somewhat cheesy and lighthearted, but the main character is quite likeable, and his frequent dialogue exchanges with his sidekick, the Mask of Death, are all very funny. The length was also quite spot on for a game like this. Took me about 10 hours to beat it on Normal.\n\nMy only serious critique for this game would be the occasional crashes to desktop that I got (and it seems there are some other people who get them too). It wasn't too bad, since the game has very frequent checkpoints, so you don't lose a lot of progress, but it's still a bug.\n\nI'd say if you enjoy action adventure games and seek something to give you heaps of entertainment, then I'd highly recommend this game. I got it for merely £4 (~$6), which is its full price on Steam and enjoyed it way more than some games which I bought for a higher price.","August 23, 2015","true","9.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

You're constantly slashing your way through the same bad guys and being bombarded with explosions which is fun for about an hour but then just grates on you. The platforming is very basic and the camera doesn't do you any favours when you're trying to jump across gaps which gets frustrating.

But Marlow Briggs lacks both charm and quality to make it appealing. Few would argue that the pricing is reasonable. However, the game suffers from too many issues to make it a recommendable game. The game consists of platforming sections and "hack n slash" combat. The problem is not the variety in combos, weapons, enemies and level design. I'd go as far as saying the developers have done a decent job (for a low-budget game anyway) in those departments. The problem is simple: PLATFORMING SECTIONS. This is a game where you don't have control over the camera so it's EXTREMELY linear - as in, you can't deviate. One would think that there is little to go wrong but you'd be wrong. You will die hundreds of times not because of poor timing or misjudgement, but because the game is simply glitchy. Inputs are not handled with any care whatsoever - the game doesn't feel consistent or smooth to play at all. Everything has a delay, and sections involving grappling or swinging are very buggy - often you can't jump off the rope, for example. Although the game is light-hearted and makes jokes about its own design, there's nothing original whatsoever. It's not classy, intelligent or well-thought out by any means. The story and characters are generic, and the level of comedy is not enough to make you laugh out loud. The problem becomes apparent when you realise that the game is TRYING to be "epic" with all its fancy locations and scenery, yet the texture quality is bad with lots of pop-in. Whilst I highly value big-budget AAA titles, I also have an appreciation for the underdogs and smaller games which sacrifice production value for a single aspect - like comedic writing/characters or focus on one specific gameplay mechanic. Unfortunately, Marlow Briggs does not impress in any department. If you are bored and have nothing better to do and are desperate for a cheap giggle, Marlow Briggs can provide that. Just don't expect it to be anything memorable.","January 29, 2015","false","3.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The visual and locations in this game are nice and beautiful, giving a sense of archaeological adventure. Combat is challenging and satisfying with a lot of weapons, combos and magics.

Great voice acting throughout.  The writing is schlocky and fun, but really dumb.\n\nOverall, a nice throwback to 80's achlock action movies that ends up being not especially fun to see through to the end.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/scrubsauce/recommended/249680/","scrubsauce","Scrubsauce","http://steamcommunity.com/id/scrubsauce/","394 products in account","Wow, where to even begin with this game?\n\nThe voice cast is star-studded.  The hero, unsurprisingly named Marlow, is portrayed by Arif Kinchen (aka Pierce from Saints Row), you've also got James Hong (Mr. Ping from Kung Fu Panda), and Steve Blum (Tom from Toonami, and pretty much everything else in existence with a voice actor). The bantor and the comedy is there, even though the game "acts" like it takes itself seriously, more on that in a bit...\n\nI've never played a God of War game, but having seen some gameplay videos from that landmark franchise I can see where the parallels are drawn from.  I played most of my playthrough with a Steam Controller using the default gamepad template Steam offers for all titles and it felt very natural.  I couldn't comment on the keyboard/mouse input as I have yet to give it a chance, but I also played the intro with a 360 controller just fine, so if you have a gamepad laying around you should give it a shot on this title as it has console roots, both mechanic and development wise.\n\nSpeaking of development, where in xibalba did this game even come from?  I remember the tweet for the release going live on the official Steam accounts, but prior to that ZootFly was never on my radar.  Even looking into their catalog, Marlow Briggs seems like a diamond in the rough.  The game launched on PC and Xbox 360 as an Arcade title, but sports graphics that would be at home on most AAA console titles from the 360/PS3 era.  There is a decent variety of enemies, with new variations and additions being thrown at you right until the end.  The settings alternate between Mesoamerican ruins that leave you wondering "how the heck did they build something so ginormous?", and humongous industrial complexes/machines that leave you wondering "why the heck did they build something so ginormous?".  The weapons and powers follow an experience based upgrade system, but the game is plenty generous with xp pickups and you usually end up maxing out your new unlocks not too long after receiving them.\n\nThe plot, and even in some portions the animation and voice acting can be received in two different ways-\n1. So cheesey and jenky that it circles around to become awesome again.\n2. Purposefully made super duper cheesey and jenky, which means it was done with just as much heart, so also making it awesome.\n\nI mean, there are scenes where your goal is to "shoot down all the helicpoters" and the game proceeds to throw nearly a 100 choppers at you.  Who has that many choppers on standby?  Who is that 100th chopper that sees the first 99 explode in front of him that says "Ef it, yolo" and continues to come at you guns blazing?  Also there's a scene where you fly a generic prop plane like Xevious and it somehow has the payload capacity for a bunch of heat seeking rockets AND machine guns under the propeller. I know, I know: What. Even.\n\nEither way, I'm not quite sure Zootfly knows what they've got with this franchise but the cliffhangerish ending demands a sequel with just as much over the top action, explosions, and lulzy dialog.","November 26, 2015","true","6.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

But don't judge so quickly it might have a linear storyline yet you encounter and experience the wildest things from hanging upside down on a helicopter to fighter a huge fish God. All while you try to save the "Princess" with your mask companion, who will bring all mental encouragement you need.\nWarning though some people might not enjoy the dialog, which is filled with cheesy comments, but also with funny comments of the ancient mask, who will tell you all about the Aztec culture and just generally comment in a funny way on what happening.\nLike I said earlier gameplay is fairly simple and you unlock 4 different weapons and 4 different spells plus a ranged attack as you progress. You also have a lot of time the possibility to mash the "E" button or the "B" button, if playing on a controller, which I found to be superior to the keyboard controls, but none the less you can play with keyboard, you'll be at a slight disadvantage against later enemies though. To no surprise, enemy variety is not that high, up until the last third of the game, where you encounter most of the bosses and harder enemies.\n\nOverall a very cheap and cheesy, but very fun game, if you enjoy over the top stupid games.

Sure it copies a decent amount of its tricks from the God of War formula, but in all honestly, that's not really a bad template to borrow from.  Throw in a little bit of Indiana Jones, 70s blaxploitation film-making, B action movies, nonsensical comedy and you've got the vibe for this game down pat.  I actually enjoyed this game more than alot of big budget games from the same genre.\n\nBriggs isn't a perfect game, yet it does so much right that I couldn't stop playing until I completed the hardcore mode today, FINALLY.  In Marlow Briggs you are killed by an evil Chinese magnate who wants to rule the world with a frightening, sort of terraforming magical power.  He kills you and kidnaps your girlfriend, though thankfully Marlow is brought back by a wise-cracking mask that guides him through his journey to save the girl, the day and the world.  The entire premise is ridiculous.  Once you're having fun with the game, the plot hardly even matters.\n\nAt its core, Briggs is a hack n' slashers delight.  You arm yourself with several types of melee weapons, magic, long range attacks and acrobatic abilities.  As you fight and explore, you earn experience to upgrade your powers, making you a killing machine on a machine.  You'll explore crazy industrial complexes, temples, caves, jungles and much more.  While graphically, Marlow and the gang aren't the best game in town; he surely isn't the worst looking either.  Levels are solidly detailed with lots to peer at in the distance and the enviroments look good while alternately being a blast to travel.  There's hidden secrets to find and numerous achievements to unlock.  There is also a hardcore mode on hand that will test your skills for certain.  It's not as impossible as Deadlight, but it will put up a stiff challenge and make you sing for your supper.\n\nYou upgrade with new equipment at key points of the game while fighting legions of foes that include all sorts of armed guards, giant insects, mythical looking boss creatures, teleporting evil priests, giants, a wolf like Hellbeast and other assorted demons.  The boss fights are a blast, and require quicks hands, strategic use of attacks/abilities and old fashioned pattern memorization.  That's really all there is to it!  The campagin is a decent length with alot of areas to explore and frequent differences in scenery so that you'll rarely be bored and when you're not fighting like a champ there are all sorts of gameplay variations to keep things exciting.  You'll man gun turrets, fly choppers and fighter planes while shooting down everything in sight, use your nimble abilities to platform your way to victory, etc.  The controls were mostly tight and responsive, so it's easy to get yourself in the action and stay there.  While I expected minimal of this game, I got way more than I bargained for and put in 28.7 hrs to beat it twice and get most of the achievements (97%).   Hell, once weakening certain monsters like the club wielding giants and monster scorpions, you can even ride and use them to fight Golden Axe style!\n\nOn the downside, sometimes the controls do tend to get a little wacky and combo stringing won't feel entirely accurate, making for a cheap death or two.  The QT buttom presses to hammer down on certain bosses and deal decisive blows don't always register, which also got me slaughtered a couple of times as well.  While not with the frequency of a survival horror game, the camera has potential to get a little rickety and you'll end up taking a beating from some foes you can't even see.  All of the problems with the game were rather minor and I actually thought this game was HIGHLY addicting and entertaining to play.  To be honest...I like it more than some of the God of War sequels.  You can scream blasphemy all you want, but that's how I felt.  Another downside is that the slow-motion cut scenes could have been better executed and the voice acting isn't top-notch (although its rampant cheesiness is rather endearing as this game is straight out of one of those B movie action 4 packs).  Overall, anyone into the hack n' slash genre would do well to check this out for the cheap price.  I hope they make a sequel with co-op!  Good lord, that'd be a blast.\n\nNow for some quick pros and cons:\n\nPros\n\n-Solid graphics and sound\n-Excellent set of weapons, abilities and magic\n-90% of the time the fighting is fluid and fun\n-Superb enemy variety with tough fights and killer battles with monstrous bosses\n-Campy storyline and voice-acting adds to the appeal\n-Combos are easy to execute and satisfying\n- 90% of the time the controls are response and fun\n-Great gameplay variety with everything listed above and even a few puzzles\n\nCons\n\n-10% of the time the fighting can be a little clunky\n-10% of the time some button presses won't register, especially the QT sequences (fortunately they are few)\n-Platforming is a beotch when the controls stutter\n\nOverall:  8.2/10","October 17, 2015","true","28.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The platforming is okay, but there are a few times where it's difficult to tell where you're supposed to go. Likewise, I ran into a few sections where the camera moves while you're supposed to be moving and it threw off the jump, leading me to more than one unfortunate and frustrating death.\n\nThat being said, the game has pretty decent humor and it knows its place in the game pantheon.

The game doesn't take itself seriously and comes off as a nonstop action/adventure game. The game is defintely short, but can be picked up for very very cheap on sale (I got it for $3.76 on Amazon for example.) Despite the fact that the game is short, it is extremely enjoyable. Gameplay is very straightforward hack and slash combat with a splash of magic. Some puzzles, "challenges", and basic platforming breaks the pace between the combat. The story is forgettable and is reminicent of B action movies. It's one of those settings that is so bad that it's just so good. Between the senseless dialogue and childish jokes you'll find one or two genuinely humoruous lines.\n\nOverall it's a solid experience for a cheap price that shouldn't be missed if you are even a little bit intrested in simliar titles. At $14.99 it is way too expensive, but for under $10 you'll find a solid 6-7 hour game that is much better than "professional" reviews claim.","January 5, 2014","true","12.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

Of particular note is its inclusion of Steve Blum as the Mask Guardian and James Hong as the villain, combat that evokes happy memories of God of War, and a big-dumb-action-movie approach with many, many explosions (in the industrial environments, at any rate).

I think they wanted to make a franchise out of this, what with the character's name on the damn title. Too bad it's all mediocre.\n\nThe combat is of the button mashing variety. There are plenty of combos that take the form of a light and heavy attack, with combinations being strung together. The problem with that sort of combo system is that you can't expect me to remember all the 'XXXY, XXXX, XYXX, YXXY' combos. It winds up just being a button masher with a combo system that has too much to memorize for it's own good. You wind up memorizing three or so moves and just constantly mash those out.\n\nIt's boring as hell. Simplicity isn't bad, route memorization is. Metal Gear Rising had a similar set-up, but the memorization was kept to a minimum. The fun in combat lied in keeping your blue gauge up and getting those quick kills. The Arkham titles have an even simpler battle system, with the challenge being in continuing your chain of attack while thwarting enemies with properly placed counters. Marlow Briggs presents nothing unique or interesting in its combat. It's just randomly hitting buttons with the challenge lying in simply keeping your health gauge up. There's nothing rewarding in the combat itself.\n\nApart from the mediocre combat, the game has light platforming and puzzle elements. When you aren't busy fighting, you'll be traversing the level with fixed camera angles. The platforming is all pretty barebones and boils down to jumping across pits and pressing the action button when appropriate. Swinging from cliffs and walking across ledges would be a lot more exciting if there was any sort of challenge to it beyond pressing a button. The fact that the camera angles are fixed means that there's not even any challenge in finding how to proceed. It's all meant to look nice and tantamount to simply pressing right on the joystick while ocassionally hitting the B button to jump across the ocassional pit. Again, it's boring.\n\nOn the positive side of things, the game looks gorgeous for a budget title. I got it for 99 cents a few sales ago, and can't comprehend how such a cheap ♥♥♥ title can look so damn good. There's even some creativity in the way some of the cutscenes unfold.\n\nOtherwise, it's all mediocre and completely forgettable. For a budget title it passes the time and is...not completely offensive, but if that's its only real upside then it really has nothing going for it.\n\nRecommended if you are, plan to be, or ever will be Tyler Perry","January 6, 2015","false","10.9"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","3","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lutsy/recommended/249680/","lutsy","Vaylute ♥","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lutsy/","695 products in account","When I recommend a video game, I tend to measure whether it's worth my time from the sum amount of fun and intrigue it produces. A game can be very intriguing, but not necessarily fun, and I can enjoy it immensely --take puzzle games, for instance, or Phoenix Wright. Vice versa, you have games like Team Fortress 2, where there's not much intrigue in story or setting but a ton of carnal fun. Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death lacks any 'umph' in either of those two elements.\n\nSure, the game can be occasionally fun. The game play is very Devil May Cry styled, quick, fierce, and sharp. The magic you get in the game, though limited, is quite satisfying, and the landscapes are generally pretty. Too often though did I find myself bored when I was chugging through the fighting segments, or struggling through some of the game's numerous mini-games. That's almost a kiss of death for a game centered around combat and platforming.\n\nOn the flip side, the game is only sort of intriguing. MBMD is just brimming with explosions, and it's sprinkled with a B-movie style humor that's actually quite charming. Only thing is, it loses its charm fast. Flat characters and a bland, almost predictable story keep this game from being interesting for me, and the flat voice acting and bland animation from everyone else beside the main characters just feels stale.\n\nSo for the most part, I really don't recommend this game. It's far from bad, but there's so much else out there that is worth playing more, unless you're really hungry for another platformer.","December 24, 2014","false","12.4"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

This is a $5 game and a pretty solid example of getting what you pay for.\n\nThe gameplay is decent, pretty good actually, but the story is slow and the platforming sections often feature really frustrating and stupid pixel-perfect jumps. Graphics are... decent.\n\nThe combat is pretty solid though, with a variety of weapons and spells. Unfortunately you might have a hard time executing your combos when your framerate suddenly drops into the single digits for no identifiable reason. On top of that, the controls are pretty... weird. with dual mapping between mouse buttons and i, o and p, for one example. This leads to some confusion when QTEs reference one set of these controls when you're using the other. On top of that, the game refuses to accept any controller that isn't an XBox 360 controller, so if you have a logitech gamepad or something else, sorry, but you're screwed. Lern2Joy2Key.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this to someone who likes this kind of game, if not for the porting issues and DRM. The DRM is of the "♥♥♥♥ your progress the connection dropped so I'm kicking you back to main menu" variety. If you don't have a stable internet connection, I would strongly advise you stay far away from this game entirely.","October 18, 2014","false","1.0"," 3 of 16 people (19%) found this review helpful","19","3","16","0","0"

Sometimes you litterally don't even have a choice, so why in the world? Also, it runs like a horse with broken legs. By that, I mean that it crashes all the damn time, and it tears up so frequently, that it's not even funny. It barely ever runs over 30 fps, even with 800x600 resolution. There is a bunch of unnecessary padding and quicktime events that just serve to waste your time, since they are not challenging, fun or add to the game in any way.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bapabooiee/recommended/249680/","Bapabooiee","Bumpa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bapabooiee/","580 products in account","At first glance, and from popular opinion, this game will seem like an underrated, cheesily self-aware but still-enjoyable spectacle-fighter at a budget price. And it is largely those things, but it's still not far from being mediocre.\n\nWhat the game has going for it is its cheesy, self-aware humor, and it did a great job of delivering on it. I smiled and got some genuine joy out of that aspect quite a number of times. I also enjoyed the set-pieces and technical-efficiency of the game. But past those, it's pretty much your run-of-the-mill CAG/hack-n-slash.\n\nAfter the novelty wore-off for me (maybe 2 hours in), I started to get increasingly bored as I progressed because the combat just didn't deliver. It's your standard button-masher where victory comes relatively easily, and where "Hard" mode doesn't make the game more difficult, but more tedious (eg, less forgiving, so you have to be more liberal with dodging, damage-sponge enemies). Any time I got into an enemy encounter, and couldn't just run past them or quickly kill them by throwing them off a cliff, I would find myself falling asleep, doing the same attacks and dodges repeatedly until everything was dead.\n\nSome other aspects that detracted were:\n\nThe puzzles. They were all mind-numbingly easy, and executing them felt like a punishment.\nThe on-rails sections and quick-time events, because they took-away agency from me.\nThe story. I did mention that the game was pretty funny, and it is, but the story really is nothing special. And the "panorama"-style cutscenes -- which I took great indulgence in the first few times -- eventually got old and hampered the pace of the game. The audio-logs were also pretty pointless.\nOverall, Marlow Briggs is beautiful, funny, and a very competent budget-priced game. But for those who have high standards for games in this genre (think: Ninja Gaiden II), it just doesn't hold-up.","December 2, 2014","false","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a spectacle fighter with fairly decent gameplay, very good for the price point, I'd say.  Think God of War centered around Rambo's black cousin.\n\nA lot of the attacks don't really feel like they have a lot of weight to them, especially with the Whip, because the enemies don't really react like they were hit or get staggered in any way. The attacks certainly at least look pretty though, and some combos feel very satisfying. Generally the combat system is fairly fleshed out imo. There are a lot of combos and each of the four weapon types has their own combo system.\n\nMy biggest problems with the game are the camera and the fairly frequent crashes. Unless I missed something you have no control of the camera at all. It generally gets the job done but often picks some angles that wouldnt exactly have been my first choice, and sometimes gets kinda awkward. And the game definitely has some stability issues. I don't know if it just hates my machine, but I'd say I crash probably once per 20-30 mins. The games usually fun enough for me to relaunch it and keep going though. But I do strongly advise you to make frequent saves. The checkpoint system is generally alright but doesn't to add more buffers in case you crash (or fall into a pit in a platforming section).\n\nOther less major complaints would include a few turret sections that I didn't love but at least they weren't THAT long or overly frequent (think i've had 3 in a couple hours of gameplay), a few kinda annoying QTEs but again not that many or very long. I could have also lived without the audio-clips from Marlow's girlfriend but I think they can be skipped if they bug you enough.\n\nThe game does have some puzzle and platforming elements that you may or may not enjoy. Persnally I thought the platforming was just challenging enough to not be boring but it didn't get frustrating or overstay its welcome. If nothing else the companion makes a few funny remarks when/if you fail. The puzzles so far have generally been pretty simplistic and I could live without them but can also live with them.\n\nGenerally I'd say I've had a pretty good time with the game, and the positives have outweighed the few problems I've had with the game. The gameplay is pretty enjoyable and I personally rather like the humor with the banter from the companion, the villain, and the occasional 4th wall breaks. Got it on sale for like $1 and I definitely got my money's worth.. and then some.","December 15, 2014","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/refresz/recommended/249680/","refresz","ref","http://steamcommunity.com/id/refresz/","503 products in account","Decided to write a small opinion about the game since almost no-one from my friendlist have it in their library.\n\ntl;dr: I liked it. Really funny spectacle fighter/brawler game.\n\nMore:\nIt's a your-standard-generic-brawler game, like any DmC or Batman games this days, yet it offers a nice original story to it placed in Mayan ruins (or Aztecs, or Toltecs, or w/e ;)). There are small glitches here and there, the combat system is not as refined as in DmC, but it was a pleasure playing it.\n\nYou are a man who visits your Ancient South America (later referred to as ASA) linguist girlfriend and suddenly you are killed because reasons (not only monsters, but people as well don't like you in this game). However, the weapon you were killed with was possessed by some god of ASA and he recognizes you as The Spirit Warrior who will bring peace to this part of Earth. And so you get resurrected and have a scythe to get through hoardes of mercenaries, possessed mercenaries, ASA warriors and other monsters and gods from ASA believes.\n\nDuring your progress you get more weapons (in total: scythe, rouge-like weapon - my fav, whip with a blade and warhammer with one side bladed) as well as learn some magic by defeating gods (fire, earth, ice and wind). Spells are summoned by using mana.\n\nYou replenish you health by collecting red orbs/masks and mana by collecting blue ones. Your abilities can by upgraded by collecting enough of yellow ones. However the upgrades are simple: each weapon and spell has three levels, and with each level you get more dmg with it, unlock 2 new moves and your health or mana base value gets higher. It's much simpler than in e.g. Darksiders: there you needed to think what to put your exp into, but here, as the weapons and spells are added to your arsenal in balanced manner, almost always you'd get one thing upgraded before having the other one obtained. With that in mind, the fight system is extremely expanded and the actions you get through sometimes are the typical Hollywood star Bruce Willis level of awesomeness actions.\n\nThe biggest issue I had with the game was the mana system. When you are fully upgraded you get to fire exactly 2 spells. But the mana bar doesn't indicate you in any way if you have enough mana to cast the spell, so you mash the buttons once or twice trying to see if it can work. As stated previously, mana is obtainable in form of blue masks (placed directly on map) or blue orbs (flying out of defeated opponent). As fights are mostly in closed area arenas with god-knows-how-much-opponents going to jump at you in next wave (if there will be any, who knows), you try to limit the usage of blue masks nearby. After you die two or three times to some bigger tank monsters and even start using the masks because why the hell not, you find yourself in a place where you need a smallest amount of mana to use the spell one more time, but it doesn't regenerate in time, and isn't replenished with inflicted damage, so you spend time and time until you finish the monster, and voila, blue f-ing orbs which you don't need anymore. And before next fight it is certain that more than one blue mask will appear.\n\nAnother problem I had were some mini-missions/challenges where you would slide down and had to avoid rocks, pits etc. Alice: Nightmare Returns had some similar sequences, but in here the time between when you push the jump button and when it is registered by the character in game was many times too big for me and I've spent countless times on some of those agility jobs.\n\nAnd one smallest issue: the game needs some power to run smoothly. On my machine DmC was running 60fps on 1080p max settings while this one had to be changed to 720p and some of the graphic options needed to be disabled. I know that Unreal Engine which DmC was running on was tended professionally through years, and I have no idea what was Marlow Briggs build on, but I would expect a little more from the game fidelity.\n\nExcept of those two and a half points above the game was really nice: the story was addictive, the fight system, combos included, was sensationally developed and fluent, graphics caught your eyes and had some great sceneries and the music was always on spot. Also, your mask-god companion has a great sense of sarcastic humour and the voice acting for it is great, so you don't get bored.\n\nHaving in mind that it is actually a budget game (€5 without a sale) this is probably one of the best fun to price factor games you can get right now.\n\nI do recommend this totally underestimated game, give it some love, ref!","November 16, 2014","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While it is nothing more than a God of War clone, it also starts off more exciting than any God of War, well paced and exciting. The problem is in the fact that the game falls apart toward the end, falling into the typical pitfalls of the character action genre, where you spend more time fighting sponges that prolong the game than feeling like you're actually accomplishing something. The first half is where the game is exceptionally entertaining but beyond that, be prepared for monotany.\n\nThat said, for a cheap-♥♥♥ game like this, it sure has great value. Good graphics, sound, and gameplay. The story is weird and silly and the cutscenes seem to come out of nowhere sometimes, but that's part of the cheap-o charm. The game itself, as I said, is a God of War ripoff unabashedly. Which means it has the problems of God of War. Some weapons are completely useless, and the stupid enemies that go underground and burrow up elsewhere are here as well. When emulating or copy and pasting a game, at least leave the bad portions out.\n\nThis is a short, fun, and cheap game that will appeal to character action fans.

The parts that aren't God of War are clones of other games you probably know. However, I found it difficult to get bored because the game goes batshit crazy at a breakneck pace. It's laugh-out-loud exhilarating and heart-pounding hilarious.\n\nIt belongs to an elite class of games like Killer Is Dead and Monkey Island - while you're playing, the game seems to be having as much fun as you are.\n\nYou can tell that it was made on a shoestring budget - every unncessary corner has been cut, but no shortcuts were taken where it counts. Cutscenes are kept to frozen key frames, but those frames are gorgeous. The characters are simple, but fantastically acted. Combat's just God of War, but it's God of War done very right.\n\nIssues include some minor control issues during platforming and some awkward camera angles, but these are the rough edges of an uncut diamond. Even when I got frustrated with repeating one section over and over again, I couldn't stay mad for long before a beautiful view and a great kill animation had me cackling with delight.\n\n9.5/10","August 29, 2014","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Doesn't do anything to revolutionise or innovate the genre, but it's got solid gameplay and very nice graphics. Enemy types might get a bit stale into the last third of the game, but new powers and weapons are unlocked at regular intervals so combat doesn't get (really) repetitive. It's not that long (clocks in at about 5 hours), and hasn't got a lot of replay value, but it's probably the most polished and good-looking game on Steam for under a single Euro.\n\nAlso, some of the dialog in the game is genuinely funny, which is really, really rare in videogames these days. The story is straight B-movie material, and there's humour intended in how it takes itself seriously sometimes. Marlow just goes around killing ancient Aztec gods and cares just enough to have a quip ready when they take their last breath.","December 12, 2014","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/refresz/recommended/249680/","refresz","ref","http://steamcommunity.com/id/refresz/","503 products in account","Decided to write a small opinion about the game since almost no-one from my friendlist have it in their library.\n\ntl;dr: I liked it. Really funny spectacle fighter/brawler game.\n\nMore:\nIt's a your-standard-generic-brawler game, like any DmC or Batman games this days, yet it offers a nice original story to it placed in Mayan ruins (or Aztecs, or Toltecs, or w/e ;)). There are small glitches here and there, the combat system is not as refined as in DmC, but it was a pleasure playing it.\n\nYou are a man who visits your Ancient South America (later referred to as ASA) linguist girlfriend and suddenly you are killed because reasons (not only monsters, but people as well don't like you in this game). However, the weapon you were killed with was possessed by some god of ASA and he recognizes you as The Spirit Warrior who will bring peace to this part of Earth. And so you get resurrected and have a scythe to get through hoardes of mercenaries, possessed mercenaries, ASA warriors and other monsters and gods from ASA believes.\n\nDuring your progress you get more weapons (in total: scythe, rouge-like weapon - my fav, whip with a blade and warhammer with one side bladed) as well as learn some magic by defeating gods (fire, earth, ice and wind). Spells are summoned by using mana.\n\nYou replenish you health by collecting red orbs/masks and mana by collecting blue ones. Your abilities can by upgraded by collecting enough of yellow ones. However the upgrades are simple: each weapon and spell has three levels, and with each level you get more dmg with it, unlock 2 new moves and your health or mana base value gets higher. It's much simpler than in e.g. Darksiders: there you needed to think what to put your exp into, but here, as the weapons and spells are added to your arsenal in balanced manner, almost always you'd get one thing upgraded before having the other one obtained. With that in mind, the fight system is extremely expanded and the actions you get through sometimes are the typical Hollywood star Bruce Willis level of awesomeness actions.\n\nThe biggest issue I had with the game was the mana system. When you are fully upgraded you get to fire exactly 2 spells. But the mana bar doesn't indicate you in any way if you have enough mana to cast the spell, so you mash the buttons once or twice trying to see if it can work. As stated previously, mana is obtainable in form of blue masks (placed directly on map) or blue orbs (flying out of defeated opponent). As fights are mostly in closed area arenas with god-knows-how-much-opponents going to jump at you in next wave (if there will be any, who knows), you try to limit the usage of blue masks nearby. After you die two or three times to some bigger tank monsters and even start using the masks because why the hell not, you find yourself in a place where you need a smallest amount of mana to use the spell one more time, but it doesn't regenerate in time, and isn't replenished with inflicted damage, so you spend time and time until you finish the monster, and voila, blue f-ing orbs which you don't need anymore. And before next fight it is certain that more than one blue mask will appear.\n\nAnother problem I had were some mini-missions/challenges where you would slide down and had to avoid rocks, pits etc. Alice: Nightmare Returns had some similar sequences, but in here the time between when you push the jump button and when it is registered by the character in game was many times too big for me and I've spent countless times on some of those agility jobs.\n\nAnd one smallest issue: the game needs some power to run smoothly. On my machine DmC was running 60fps on 1080p max settings while this one had to be changed to 720p and some of the graphic options needed to be disabled. I know that Unreal Engine which DmC was running on was tended professionally through years, and I have no idea what was Marlow Briggs build on, but I would expect a little more from the game fidelity.\n\nExcept of those two and a half points above the game was really nice: the story was addictive, the fight system, combos included, was sensationally developed and fluent, graphics caught your eyes and had some great sceneries and the music was always on spot. Also, your mask-god companion has a great sense of sarcastic humour and the voice acting for it is great, so you don't get bored.\n\nHaving in mind that it is actually a budget game (€5 without a sale) this is probably one of the best fun to price factor games you can get right now.\n\nI do recommend this totally underestimated game, give it some love, ref!","November 16, 2014","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Doesn't do anything to revolutionise or innovate the genre, but it's got solid gameplay and very nice graphics. Enemy types might get a bit stale into the last third of the game, but new powers and weapons are unlocked at regular intervals so combat doesn't get (really) repetitive. It's not that long (clocks in at about 5 hours), and hasn't got a lot of replay value, but it's probably the most polished and good-looking game on Steam for under a single Euro.\n\nAlso, some of the dialog in the game is genuinely funny, which is really, really rare in videogames these days. The story is straight B-movie material, and there's humour intended in how it takes itself seriously sometimes. Marlow just goes around killing ancient Aztec gods and cares just enough to have a quip ready when they take their last breath.","December 12, 2014","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Easily the best quality to price ratio I've seen in years. You play as Marlow Briggs, a man who takes getting shot and being imbued with the power of ancient Mayan spirits all in stride. While they've traded Kratos' brooding for banter, the gameplay is identical to God of War: slash your way through bad guys, solve some minor puzzles, fight a boss.\n\nWhat's truly surprising is that the visuals are pretty close to the quality of a AAA series like GoW, the only time it's low budget becomes obvious is in the several cutscenes where they show a series of freeze-frames... it's a stylish presentation but it's pretty obvious they just didn't have the cash to do all the action. The levels you actually play through though are practically lavish in the details. It's a short game and it keeps you entertained throughout.

So, I entered with low expectations....\n\nThat said, what I found was actually kinda good.\n\n\nIt is the most random ♥♥♥ cliche mix of "Guy threatened your girl, you pushed back, he killed you, magic happened and now you can go get your revenge and save your lady".   And really, that's all the more you need, because god damn is it a lovely throwback of just mindlessly blowing s*** up and beating up dudes because, hell, because it looks cool.\n\nIt fills all the naughty cliches of some quick and silly turret sections, sometimes questionable checkpoints, and wonky difficulty curve at the end.   And yes, that difficulty spike is annoying---Going from playing whack-a-mole and one or two shotting everything, to 25 hits on basic mooks with fully upgraded gear being "standard".   But, if you can press on, it's still pretty fun and rewarding in it's own way to conqure the odds.\n\n\nFilled with witty humor, some 4th wall breaking, and a trash talking God that thinks he knows it all leads to some amusing banter back and forth along your journey.   For every bad thing it does, it fills a few more throwbacks to just good old fashion, no-nonsense beat 'em up for the sake of beating them up fun.\n\nIt's a 5-6 hour experience, and you know what, for $1...Or even $5, it's worth your time if you want a bit of a throwback brawler to mess around in and then but back in the closet.  You too might be surprised by it.\n\nAlso, damn, for an unheard of game, it is dang pretty at times.

The plot is simple but neat, and the villian is pretty wonderfully awful. I like the protagonist and enjoy playing him, and the combat is great fun and satisfying.\n\nBut I found the game mechanics and terrain a little weird - I would end up stuck because of weird jump puzzles that required expert timing and control to get past. I got the feeling those parts were not meant to be confusing, just badly thought out. It just became frustrating. The controls and camera angle changes reminded me of "Landstalker," and could be confusing during parts of the game that required careful control or even just pushing objects around.\n\nOverall it's a good game but I would prefer the challenge come from harder enemies or outright proper puzzles than just confusing terrain. I spent more time timing jumps than actually fighting, so it felt like more of a puzzle game than a hack and slash.\n\nI played a few hours but I don't think I'll ever finish it.

Marlow Briggs proves that this is not always the case.\nDespite the low budget, the game boasts an amazing presentation on par with most AAA-games.\nThe gameplay is also really fun, a lot like God of War in a good way. Not only is the combat and platforming really fun, with great controls and a great variety of weapons and combos, but there is also variety in gameplay-styles, so things don't get too repetitive.\nThe story itself is really simple: Save your girlfriend from her evil boss.\nHowever, the aforementioned presentation and the characters really make the experience very enjoyable.\nMarlow Briggs himself is a very badass and likeable character (not to mention, a rare black protagonist that isn't a stereotypical gangsta), and King Tep, the titular Mask of Death, is a hilarious companion, with praise going to Steve Blum's funny and over-the-top performance. The witty conservations between them really makes the characters memorable, not to forget the hilarious despicable villain.\nThe only negative thing that I can think of, is the fact that you can't change the graphical settings, so people with not-as-powerful computers/laptops are going to have problems running the game at a decent framerate, unlees you change the resolution.\nIn short, a very enjoyable fighter with a b-movie-feel, but in good way, since the game itself has fun with it.\nIf you like games like God of War, and enjoy movies like the ones Michael Bay makes, then Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death is an awesome game :D :D","October 2, 2014","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While it is nothing more than a God of War clone, it also starts off more exciting than any God of War, well paced and exciting. The problem is in the fact that the game falls apart toward the end, falling into the typical pitfalls of the character action genre, where you spend more time fighting sponges that prolong the game than feeling like you're actually accomplishing something. The first half is where the game is exceptionally entertaining but beyond that, be prepared for monotany.\n\nThat said, for a cheap-♥♥♥ game like this, it sure has great value. Good graphics, sound, and gameplay. The story is weird and silly and the cutscenes seem to come out of nowhere sometimes, but that's part of the cheap-o charm. The game itself, as I said, is a God of War ripoff unabashedly. Which means it has the problems of God of War. Some weapons are completely useless, and the stupid enemies that go underground and burrow up elsewhere are here as well. When emulating or copy and pasting a game, at least leave the bad portions out.\n\nThis is a short, fun, and cheap game that will appeal to character action fans.

Short campaign that pretty much just drops you in. The plot seems like it would fit in a 90s action movie. And that's great. The developers know it and took advantage of it. Marlow and the mask have back and forths through out the game that provides some additional comedic relief. There is also actual explanations for the flame jets and general hazards through out the game. Not something that is usually answered.\n\nThe game does kind of hold your hand where it makes it pretty much impossible to jump off an edge unless there's a platform across the chasm, which is annoying. There is also an issue for me where jumping off a rope on to another platform higher up just doesn't happen. I have to be positioned absolutely perfectly for it to let me jump off.

The interactions between Marlow and the Mask are pretty human-like and the mask isn't like some stuck-up boring character. The mask is chill as ♥♥♥♥, bro-tier and sometimes compliments or insults Marlow playfully.\n\nHere's a good example:\nMask: "Ek Chuah Ix. This is your name as the sacred warrior reborn!

Although he has new abilities, he's still human and reacts to things very human-like. Instead of being some edgy guy, he reacts to situations how normal people would react. For example here is one of his quotes: "Who designed this?!"\n\nSetting: Beautifully illuminated and just looks pretty in general.

The sale is over and the game's regular price is 5 bucks. Is it worth it's regular price? Absolutely.\n\nThis game is the closest that exclusive PC gamers who refuse to game on a console will ever get to playing God of War. As a huge God of War fan I can tell you that Marlow Briggs gets the job done as the combat system is near identical and feels just as good as God of War. I will say that the quick time events are much more forgiving in this game and they do not seem to be as well placed as they are in God of War. However the story is much more light hearted and humerous, so the game does not take itself seriously in the slightest which is good. If you get this game do yourself a favor and turn the music and sound effects down so you can hear the dialog durring gameplay. What I really like about this game is that it has added some variety to the God of War formula by having places where you need to shoot things down with big gun turrets and added rooms with moving obstacles to avoid while fighting enemies. Some of the game's cutscenes are a bit too dragged out with the whole Matrix like, slow camera panning scenes which only seem to slow things down, but every cutscene is 100% skippable if you feel the game is dragging which is a great feature. Also just like God of War, I felt the game was a little too easy on the normal difficulty so I recommend the hard difficulty to really heat things up and to make fights not feel so one sided.\n\nIn the end, wether you pay a buck or five bucks, you will have a good time.

I recently played X-blades (which is terrible) and was shocked to find how much of a disaster the controls were, playing Marlow briggs feels as tight as playing Dark Siders or Devil may cry ( but not DmC that one sucked a big butt).\n\nThe whole game from voice acting, art style and writing are all meant to convey a certain kind of "cheese" but there are genuine moments of deep content and criticism of the videogame narative.\nHave you ever played a game and wondered how workers in the factory actually got over these jumps and dodged the steam pipes and flame pillars? Well in Marlow Briggs the game explains that the workers in the ore refinery actually sabotaged the building by removing ladders, breaking platforms and turning the flames on. Making the level design actually have a place in the world, unlike a lot of games where only the protagonist could actually navigate them making them non functional or convoluted.\n\nSmall fourth wall breaking features and moments in the dialogue that poke fun at the narrative of videogames really help build a relationship with the main characters\n\nCheck out my lets play of Marlow Briggs at youtube.com /Deppresso","July 5, 2014","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Easily the best quality to price ratio I've seen in years. You play as Marlow Briggs, a man who takes getting shot and being imbued with the power of ancient Mayan spirits all in stride. While they've traded Kratos' brooding for banter, the gameplay is identical to God of War: slash your way through bad guys, solve some minor puzzles, fight a boss.\n\nWhat's truly surprising is that the visuals are pretty close to the quality of a AAA series like GoW, the only time it's low budget becomes obvious is in the several cutscenes where they show a series of freeze-frames... it's a stylish presentation but it's pretty obvious they just didn't have the cash to do all the action. The levels you actually play through though are practically lavish in the details. It's a short game and it keeps you entertained throughout.

And really, that's all the more you need, because god damn is it a lovely throwback of just mindlessly blowing s*** up and beating up dudes because, hell, because it looks cool.\n\nIt fills all the naughty cliches of some quick and silly turret sections, sometimes questionable checkpoints, and wonky difficulty curve at the end.   And yes, that difficulty spike is annoying---Going from playing whack-a-mole and one or two shotting everything, to 25 hits on basic mooks with fully upgraded gear being "standard".

I do not ever recall this game being advertised but it is a good game.\n\nThe main villian is trying to get immortality. He enlists the help of your girlfriend. When she decides to leave they kill you to make her finish her work. You are brought back to life to stop this guy from getting supernatural abilities. As far as the plot goes, that is about it.\n\nFor a pretty straight forword storyline, you travel to many locations and fight a good variety of creatures. The boss battles are interesting and cool looking.\n\nThe things that will annoy you  in this game are first off the talking mask that follows you. He is not very informative and seams to suffer from exceptional hindsite. Secondly at certain parts of the game (mostly when getting new upgrades or end of boss battles) the game does a stop motion revolving take of what is going on. As it turns the scenes change and then you go on into the next area. Way to often! Lastly THE INVISIBLE WALLS. there are times when you plan a jump only to hit an invisible wall killing you prompting that mask to make another snide remake about how that should not of happened.\n\nAll in all it is a good game with decent fighting mechanics.

Short campaign that pretty much just drops you in. The plot seems like it would fit in a 90s action movie. And that's great. The developers know it and took advantage of it. Marlow and the mask have back and forths through out the game that provides some additional comedic relief. There is also actual explanations for the flame jets and general hazards through out the game. Not something that is usually answered.\n\nThe game does kind of hold your hand where it makes it pretty much impossible to jump off an edge unless there's a platform across the chasm, which is annoying. There is also an issue for me where jumping off a rope on to another platform higher up just doesn't happen. I have to be positioned absolutely perfectly for it to let me jump off. Other than these the game was great. Similar in play style to God of War, Dante's Inferno and those types of games where you go for combos and stringing attacks together.\n\nAll in all.

It is start-to-finish fast-paced hack-n-slash third-person action and fun set-pieces, only slowing down due to the incompetence of the player, yet even then the game is always pushing you in the right direction. At one point I was stuck and the Mask (companion) gave hints within 1 minute of me running around, and another minute later told me to just push the cart into the pistons, which was all I had to do. The game is also very forgiving with a ridiculous frequency of checkpoints.\nI wasn't even caring about the collectibles and the game still lasted me about 6 hours, 6 hours of straight and varied action with just a touch of puzzle-solving, no filler whatsoever. Looking back the combat seemed a little repetitive, though I guess that was just me using the same combos over and over. People are right when they say it is similar to God of War, though GOW is not on PC....\n\nThe game has an incredibly low asking price on steam, let alone sale price. In terms of value for money, this game is definitely up there.

It's a spectacle fighter with fairly decent gameplay, very good for the price point, I'd say.  Think God of War centered around Rambo's black cousin.\n\nA lot of the attacks don't really feel like they have a lot of weight to them, especially with the Whip, because the enemies don't really react like they were hit or get staggered in any way. The attacks certainly at least look pretty though, and some combos feel very satisfying. Generally the combat system is fairly fleshed out imo. There are a lot of combos and each of the four weapon types has their own combo system.\n\nMy biggest problems with the game are the camera and the fairly frequent crashes. Unless I missed something you have no control of the camera at all. It generally gets the job done but often picks some angles that wouldnt exactly have been my first choice, and sometimes gets kinda awkward. And the game definitely has some stability issues. I don't know if it just hates my machine, but I'd say I crash probably once per 20-30 mins. The games usually fun enough for me to relaunch it and keep going though. But I do strongly advise you to make frequent saves. The checkpoint system is generally alright but doesn't to add more buffers in case you crash (or fall into a pit in a platforming section).\n\nOther less major complaints would include a few turret sections that I didn't love but at least they weren't THAT long or overly frequent (think i've had 3 in a couple hours of gameplay), a few kinda annoying QTEs but again not that many or very long. I could have also lived without the audio-clips from Marlow's girlfriend but I think they can be skipped if they bug you enough.\n\nThe game does have some puzzle and platforming elements that you may or may not enjoy. Persnally I thought the platforming was just challenging enough to not be boring but it didn't get frustrating or overstay its welcome. If nothing else the companion makes a few funny remarks when/if you fail. The puzzles so far have generally been pretty simplistic and I could live without them but can also live with them.\n\nGenerally I'd say I've had a pretty good time with the game, and the positives have outweighed the few problems I've had with the game. The gameplay is pretty enjoyable and I personally rather like the humor with the banter from the companion, the villain, and the occasional 4th wall breaks. Got it on sale for like $1 and I definitely got my money's worth.. and then some.","December 15, 2014","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a pretty good, bombastic, blacksploitation version of God of War for PC. If you've played God of War (or Dantes Inferno for that matter), you'll know the score here. Constantly dancing dealing death with bright weapon trails between simple platforming and puzzle sections.\n\nWhat's great about this game is the standard it sets. For such a small game, it really tries to stand out next to the AAA titles it mimics. The plot is a rather generic, tale of afterlife, revenge and rescuing a damsel in distress. The whole game uses voodoo and industrialism as it's theme, much like God of War uses greek mythology and the Underworld.\n\nThe graphics are pretty spectacular for such a short and budget developed game, with some excellent framed vistas which can be compared to the Uncharted series, the soundtrack can sometimes be repetitve and tiresome but the game is complimented by funny banter between Marlow and the titular Mask of Death, heckling Marlow's 'tough guy' one liners, in a sense, a buddy movie dynamic and not to far away from what the reboot of Shadow Warrior does. The game is full of Hollywood typical explosion visuals and solid sound effects.\n\nOccasionally, the game takes you by surprise and ejects you into a minigame of a race collecting orbs, sliding down pathways avoiding obstacles, or a magnificently over the top on rails shooting section shooting helicopters down from the back of a moving vehicle and finally a top down arcade shooter much like Capcom's 1942 series, which is a pleasant diversion,\n\nThe game took me eight hours to beat in total and if experienced to the hack and slash format, platforming and puzzles that GoW delivers, you'll find no problems getting through the game. Much like GoW acquired weapons and abilities can be upgraded, but the selection is very, very limited and it's incredibly easy to upgrade the weapons using collectable orbs.\n\nThe controls are pretty solid and translated for mouse and keyboard, much like Blades of Time, (another PC hack and slash game), my only issue is using magic abilities using the complicated layout of holding down left control and a numberic key 1-4, which can make fights difficult if you want to attempt to use a magic move to wear enemies down. The boss fights are nothing spectacular and are just more or less obstacles from one section or another or purely acquiring a new ability. There is also no opportunity of back tracking in this game whatsoever and for that matter, nothing to backtrack for.\n\nEven the credits are a bit of fun, you can tell the developers had a lot of fun making this title and it's totally worth a blast for a quick action/adventure/hack and slash title if you want to give it 6-8 hours. You might find yourself pleasantly surprised.","February 7, 2014","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game pokes fun at the genre stereotypes and the verbal "swordplay" between Marlow and the Mask of Death that accompanies you is often genuinely funny.\n\nThe game will take you about 8 hours to finish, which is long enough and ensures that the game doesn't become a chore to finish.

The sale is over and the game's regular price is 5 bucks. Is it worth it's regular price? Absolutely.\n\nThis game is the closest that exclusive PC gamers who refuse to game on a console will ever get to playing God of War. As a huge God of War fan I can tell you that Marlow Briggs gets the job done as the combat system is near identical and feels just as good as God of War. I will say that the quick time events are much more forgiving in this game and they do not seem to be as well placed as they are in God of War. However the story is much more light hearted and humerous, so the game does not take itself seriously in the slightest which is good. If you get this game do yourself a favor and turn the music and sound effects down so you can hear the dialog durring gameplay. What I really like about this game is that it has added some variety to the God of War formula by having places where you need to shoot things down with big gun turrets and added rooms with moving obstacles to avoid while fighting enemies. Some of the game's cutscenes are a bit too dragged out with the whole Matrix like, slow camera panning scenes which only seem to slow things down, but every cutscene is 100% skippable if you feel the game is dragging which is a great feature. Also just like God of War, I felt the game was a little too easy on the normal difficulty so I recommend the hard difficulty to really heat things up and to make fights not feel so one sided.\n\nIn the end, wether you pay a buck or five bucks, you will have a good time.

Well in Marlow Briggs the game explains that the workers in the ore refinery actually sabotaged the building by removing ladders, breaking platforms and turning the flames on. Making the level design actually have a place in the world, unlike a lot of games where only the protagonist could actually navigate them making them non functional or convoluted.\n\nSmall fourth wall breaking features and moments in the dialogue that poke fun at the narrative of videogames really help build a relationship with the main characters\n\nCheck out my lets play of Marlow Briggs at youtube.com /Deppresso","July 5, 2014","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/freker/recommended/249680/","freker","Freker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/freker/","934 products in account","This game is pretty kickass.\n\nDon't dismiss this as a paltry God of War clone. It's a pretty good, bombastic, blacksploitation version of God of War for PC. If you've played God of War (or Dantes Inferno for that matter), you'll know the score here. Constantly dancing dealing death with bright weapon trails between simple platforming and puzzle sections.\n\nWhat's great about this game is the standard it sets. For such a small game, it really tries to stand out next to the AAA titles it mimics. The plot is a rather generic, tale of afterlife, revenge and rescuing a damsel in distress. The whole game uses voodoo and industrialism as it's theme, much like God of War uses greek mythology and the Underworld.\n\nThe graphics are pretty spectacular for such a short and budget developed game, with some excellent framed vistas which can be compared to the Uncharted series, the soundtrack can sometimes be repetitve and tiresome but the game is complimented by funny banter between Marlow and the titular Mask of Death, heckling Marlow's 'tough guy' one liners, in a sense, a buddy movie dynamic and not to far away from what the reboot of Shadow Warrior does. The game is full of Hollywood typical explosion visuals and solid sound effects.\n\nOccasionally, the game takes you by surprise and ejects you into a minigame of a race collecting orbs, sliding down pathways avoiding obstacles, or a magnificently over the top on rails shooting section shooting helicopters down from the back of a moving vehicle and finally a top down arcade shooter much like Capcom's 1942 series, which is a pleasant diversion,\n\nThe game took me eight hours to beat in total and if experienced to the hack and slash format, platforming and puzzles that GoW delivers, you'll find no problems getting through the game. Much like GoW acquired weapons and abilities can be upgraded, but the selection is very, very limited and it's incredibly easy to upgrade the weapons using collectable orbs.\n\nThe controls are pretty solid and translated for mouse and keyboard, much like Blades of Time, (another PC hack and slash game), my only issue is using magic abilities using the complicated layout of holding down left control and a numberic key 1-4, which can make fights difficult if you want to attempt to use a magic move to wear enemies down. The boss fights are nothing spectacular and are just more or less obstacles from one section or another or purely acquiring a new ability. There is also no opportunity of back tracking in this game whatsoever and for that matter, nothing to backtrack for.\n\nEven the credits are a bit of fun, you can tell the developers had a lot of fun making this title and it's totally worth a blast for a quick action/adventure/hack and slash title if you want to give it 6-8 hours. You might find yourself pleasantly surprised.","February 7, 2014","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is start-to-finish fast-paced hack-n-slash third-person action and fun set-pieces, only slowing down due to the incompetence of the player, yet even then the game is always pushing you in the right direction. At one point I was stuck and the Mask (companion) gave hints within 1 minute of me running around, and another minute later told me to just push the cart into the pistons, which was all I had to do. The game is also very forgiving with a ridiculous frequency of checkpoints.\nI wasn't even caring about the collectibles and the game still lasted me about 6 hours, 6 hours of straight and varied action with just a touch of puzzle-solving, no filler whatsoever. Looking back the combat seemed a little repetitive, though I guess that was just me using the same combos over and over. People are right when they say it is similar to God of War, though GOW is not on PC....\n\nThe game has an incredibly low asking price on steam, let alone sale price. In terms of value for money, this game is definitely up there. It is easily the best purchase of the summer 2014 sale for me, and one of the best steam purchases ever.","June 27, 2014","true","20.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The only change here is the combat feels slower and clunkier, they have a black protaganist instead of a white one, and they changed the lore from greek to... african I guess? Im not really sure if the lore is made up or if its based on some tribal history.\n\nAnd that camera angel... The entire game is fixed camera. Which means it tells you where to go and what to look at and the platforming you'll be doing is harder because you cant judge distance.

The protagonist, Marlow Briggs, gets the same treatment: he manages to be a little bit of every black action hero all rolled into one, complete with an overly dramatic and painfully stereotypical 'brotha' persona who is just full of less-than-witty one-liners.\n\nThat being said, the game delivers on fun and exciting combat and the action is simply over the top.

I feel like I just conned Steam out of a really fun game that's worth at least 20 dollars, kind of like the yard sale down the street that is selling something that costs 250 dollars on ebay for 8 dollars because "it's just taking up too much space."

Secondly at certain parts of the game (mostly when getting new upgrades or end of boss battles) the game does a stop motion revolving take of what is going on. As it turns the scenes change and then you go on into the next area. Way to often! Lastly THE INVISIBLE WALLS. there are times when you plan a jump only to hit an invisible wall killing you prompting that mask to make another snide remake about how that should not of happened.\n\nAll in all it is a good game with decent fighting mechanics.

The plot is silly, which is what makes this enjoyable. Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death goes over the top from the first second and never looks back.\n\nThe port is so-and-so, and some might have a hard time adjusting to the controls, which at times are very clunky. The fighting system is sufficient, although some weapons and powers are fairly useless from the get go, while others become your bread and butter the second you unlock them.\n\nThis is a high action brawler with little room for breaks. Unfortunately, several enemies are downright boring to fight, and after a while become overly repetitive. The final boss is suitable for a game like this, but I personally found it to be a chore more than enjoyable.\n\nAll in all, if you want several hours worth of entertaining brawling and like B film plots and dialogue, this is well worth picking up.","February 13, 2015","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't know what they are smoking. Sure, given it's low price i can understand that many start the game with low expectations about it. But i found this game amazing, deserving well more than 5 bucks. As soon as you get to the main menu, you are greeted to one of the best epic main menu songs out there. Everytime i started the game, i couldn't help but listening to the music for at least 2 minutes. The rest of the music are ok, but this song makes up for all of them. Now speaking of the game, it's a ripoff of God of War, but a pretty good one. The story surely sucks, but there's plenty of funny dialog. The graphics are decent and the game is surprisingly well optimized for PC. Now speaking of the gameplay, it's mostly an Hack and Slash. There's a light and a heavy attack that you can combo, and a grab, block and jump buttons. There's 4 weapons and 5 magic powers that you collect, and they all play differently. You can also upgrade them. The combat is good, with a solid variety of enemy types and bosses, but blocking fells a bit off because you can't block in the middle of an attack, so you'll be evading most of the time. Besides combat, there are also sections of platforming (those could be better), puzzle solving, evading obstacles, 3D shooting and top down shooting. Together, it'll last about 6 hours, and if you are like me, you'll play right again on the hardcore difficulty, which isn't really that hard except for some encounters later in the game. For it's price, it has a good lenght. And you can also replay some challenges from the story in the menu with leaderboards, but for me only the first time was added. Probably a bug, but didn't care much about it. And there's also a minigame in the credits, which sucks but lets you skip the credits the faster you complete it. It was a nice addition to finish the game. In the end, the game isn't brilliant, but surprisingly good given it's price, and you should definitely get it if you're a fan of Hack and Slash games. And one sale, it's a steal.","October 12, 2015","true","20.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The plot is silly, which is what makes this enjoyable. Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death goes over the top from the first second and never looks back.\n\nThe port is so-and-so, and some might have a hard time adjusting to the controls, which at times are very clunky. The fighting system is sufficient, although some weapons and powers are fairly useless from the get go, while others become your bread and butter the second you unlock them.\n\nThis is a high action brawler with little room for breaks. Unfortunately, several enemies are downright boring to fight, and after a while become overly repetitive. The final boss is suitable for a game like this, but I personally found it to be a chore more than enjoyable.\n\nAll in all, if you want several hours worth of entertaining brawling and like B film plots and dialogue, this is well worth picking up.","February 13, 2015","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was just that I had to take out time for a third person story driven game. But once I started to play this game, I wanted to play through it completely, cause I found it fun! Where most of the games become a chore sometimes, this one was actually fun. Though if you are really a game critic you may not review this game very highly. Its understandable, I think this is one of those games, you would play once and be done with. Somehow the fun element in this game reminded me of console games back in the 90s, with revamped twist to it.\n\nMain points\n* Third person story driven hack n slash type\n* main empahsis is on the story, and you getting to beat up the enemies.\n* The game isn't all that difficult but still decently challenging.\n* Beating the enemies is repetitive, but you won't really get bored cause the game is mainly story driven, and a lot is happening all the time. Things really change with the scenery and all, so you don't get bored of the beat em up!\n* Also the game is short, at about 8 hours I completed it, and I liked it!\n\nVerdict-\nIf you are looking for a fun game, that you wanna pick up and play to relax or just chill perhaps, you will find what you are looking for. Also, this game isn't a time sink, you'll pretty much be able to unlock all the abilities and get almost all the achievements on steam in about 8 hours time!\n\nSo at the end you'll be all happy happy! :)","March 13","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It’s an over the top, in your face action and comedic hack and slash. I definitely enjoyed my playthrough of it.\n\nYou play as Marlow, trying to save your girlfriend, Eva, after she is taken hostage to decipher some ancient codices. I was quite surprised with the range of environments that you are taken through. They are nicely done too and feel full and rich.\n\nAn odd thing to point out, but I will. The game sets up the “camera” to be the Mask of Death following you around. Or at least that’s how I interpreted it. Reminded me of how Mario 64 implied the Lakitu Brothers were “filming you” during gameplay.\n\nSince we are on the camera, there is a love/hate relationship with it. The camera is FIXED and you cannot control it. This can, and is, used to hide secrets and extra experience points that are out of view until you explore a little. Generally, it’s good and doesn’t get in the way. But on occasion, especially during battle, it will not let you see where the enemy is. It also tended to lag behind if I started moving too fast. The multiple rope swinging segments are brought to mind where this happened. In the end, it wasn’t too much of a nuisance.\n\nMarlow Briggs is extremely linear. I don’t mind this at all in games, but I know this is a personal preference. There are invisible walls everywhere and you cannot explore much outside your destined path. I say can’t explore “much” because you can go in little crevices and off camera areas that give you experience. It definitely rewards you for doing what little exploring you can.\n\nControls feel relatively tight during combat and responsive during the many platforming segments. I would highly recommend a controller to play this game. It was released on the 360 and it shows. The mouse and keyboard controls are awkward and I immediately switched to a controller. The game switches seamlessly between the two, which is appreciated.\n\nMarlow can upgrade and acquire a few more weapons and magic powers throughout the playthough. You can switch quickly and easily between them for whatever situation you’re in. I tended to stick with the weapon that was on a chain for a majority of the game after I acquired it. It’s the only ranged weapon and felt the most safe using it. It was also easy to break out of a combo and dodge an enemy attack. The magic powers are visually cool, but consistently felt underpowered. They were expensive to use (Mana) and would usually not even kill the smaller enemies. I wish they were quite a bit more powerful or used less Mana.\n\nSaving is spectacular. Tons of auto-saves and you can save manually at any point. I always love to see this in games.\n\nGraphically the game is quite good! I found myself taking a lot of screenshots because of the really nice looking environments I was in. However, there are NO graphics options to play around with. You get to choose your resolution and if it’s full screen or not. That’s it…\n\nSound and music is good. I felt some of the epic songs got tired since they were used a lot during the cut scenes.\n\nLet’s get to the Pros and Cons\n\nPros\n+Awesome, over the top action. All the explosions you could ask for\n+Nice graphics\n+Great auto and manual save system\n+Controls feel good (use a controller to play!)\n+Fantastic variety of environments\n+Solid variety of enemies. (Possessed enemies are recycled)\n+Weapon combos are cool\n+Good game length. Not too short or long.\n+Rewarded for the small amount of exploring you can do\n+60fps throughout\n\nCons\n+No graphics options?! (Just resolution and full screen toggle)\n+Magic powers felt weak, cost too much Mana\n+Puzzles could be more challenging\n+Camera at times can be frustrating\n+Slightly repetitive\n\nWorth the $5 asking price and a “must buy” if it’s on some type of sale or in a bundle. I had a great time playing Marlow Briggs. The gripes I had are easily overlooked by the crazy action everywhere.\n\n8.5/10\n","December 21, 2015","true","9.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is not a bad game, there are many worse games out there.\n*Fix Camera angle in a 3D enviroment, which is very very very annoying.\n*A number of puzzles did not have the right physics and it led to solutions that are not apparent\n*This game is a god of war clone, but the different weapons have little differences except for the whip-blade.\n*The magics serve the same purpose, but consume too much manner and that renders them optional in gameplay. There is no fun in using magic attacks\n*I hate it when developers combine enemies that are spawn non-stop, WITH puzzle. It sucks big time, I can do something better than playing this game with my time.\n*A good game has you practice trial and error of any with a gameplay that is fun and engaging, this medicore gameplay have you killed because the control is not best designed for it. For instance, the whipblade's strong attack can easily miss the enemy you want to hit, there are four different fight styles but most moves in each style lead to loss of health, and the air attacks are useless to most enemies.\n*I don't care what happen that fictional dimsel in the plot.\n(A black protagonist get killed over a  white woman and then resurrected, just to die many times again through out the game for that same white woman -- this game is one to be hidden from the single sisters and single mom sister hehe)","January 26","false","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When those games first hit the market, videos games as an industry woul never be the same.  In a market that constantly demands innovation, development of new concepts and methods of interaction, it can be easy to forget how amazing certain tried and true formula can be.  I STILL love playing God of War...  and this game, is a shameless clone/update, call it what you will.  Graphically upated, and skinned in a different mythos, Kratos becomes Marlow.\n\nThis games isn't promising anything revolutionary.  It also refuses to take itself seriously.  The production value is solid, the voice acting well done.  The narrator that is Marlow's "spirit guide" i suppose, is constantly making wise cracks.  I found the game delightful.\n\nEvery time I wanted to put the controller down, it kept pulling me back in...  a familiar feeling.  It isn't perfect and it doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it brought back a play style and experience that I feel you don't find enough in modern gaming.  I think someone described it as being able to play a 90's action blockbuster....  fairly dead on.\n\nGet it on sale and you will not be dissapointed.  It's FUN.  Engaging and you will not have to think to hard.  Everyting in it takes place on an epic scale.  An abundance of great Mini-games too.\n\nI am not finished with the game at this point.  I did notice the absence of any MEGA boss fights (Kratos vs the hydra  or kraken) but perhaps those are to come.","February 18","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Kinchen) has lso voiced a certain saint in a different game XD\n\nBest way to summarize it:\nPierce get its own movie with Michael Bay in charge of the fight scenes and Crash bandicoot Mask "Aku Aku" as an hilarious sidekick!\n\nMy advice: Play it! Beyond the fact that this game price is incredebly low, and regardless of your take on the story, the dialogue and actions will keep you entertained for the ride :D","March 28","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

He awakens as the "sacred warrior", accompanied by an annoying talking mask, and must battle through hordes of mercenary mooks, jungles full of exploding bugs the size of dogs, scorpions the size of cars, and giant zombie warriors.\n\nLike its obvious antecedent God of War, it's a reasonably solid mix of platforming and button-mashing combat (long "combos" created through the light and heavy attack buttons, with four different weapons unlocked through the game), with occasional puzzles. As is often the case with this sort of design, it doesn't do any one thing particularly well -- the Arkham games ruined combat for everyone else, and it definitely gets repetitive here, and the platforming sequences are uninspiring make-work. There are also a number of strange mini-game sequences, e.g. manning a turret to shoot down helicopters and two instances of flying an aircraft in a particularly terrible Raiden-style top-down shooter.\n\nWhere it really shines, though, like God of War, is as blockbuster spectacle -- a "boss" that's an enormous screen-filling sea monster, platforming through a collapsing mine etc. The story isn't much to write home about it but it provides a reason to hurtle from one explosive crisis to the next. It's entirely linear.\n\nThe variety of environments and enemies is fairly good, though the game is relatively short (~6 hours). It's not stunningly polished; there are invisible walls everywhere, occasional issues with the controls etc.\n\nSome negative reviews here complain about checkpoint spacing, which I wuold agree with except that it appears to be possible to create your own checkpoint at any time with a quicksave from the menu.\n\nIt's good fun and available so cheaply that it's well worth giving a go.","April 9","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No game with this small a budget should look this good, no game with this small a team should PLAY this good, and no premise as absurd as this should work as well as it does. Yes, it's short, but it's also dirt cheap, and the four hours I spent on this game alone make it an incredibly worthwhile experience. It's funny, amazingly well paced, looks great and has some suprisingly good combat for being a God of War clone. It's a game I think everyone should play at least 20 minutes of, so they can see and bask in the glory of Marlow ♥♥♥♥ing Briggs.\n\nWhat i'm trying to say is that you should play this game because it's really damn good.","May 10","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
