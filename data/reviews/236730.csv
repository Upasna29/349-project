"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlamesSuperior/recommended/236730/","FlamesSuperior","UpInFlames","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlamesSuperior/","263 products in account","Anomaly 2 is the sequel to the innovative 2011 Anomaly: Warzone Earth. It’s a reverse tower defense game or tower offense in which you protect the attackers and destroy the towers. The premise of the game is simple – alien machines have invaded and Earth is in ruins. You are the only hope to reach the titular anomaly and destroy them. Regrettably, Anomaly 2 has more story exposition than its predecessor which wouldn’t be a bad thing if it wasn’t very poorly written and voice acted. You have all sorts of terrible cliches including hillbilly marines, an elderly German scientist and a younger female doctor all with equally horrible accents. At least you can skip all the cutscenes.\n\nAnomaly 2 is all about the gameplay and that’s where it shines. The player takes over the role of the Commander unit which is tasked to protect and guide the military unit convoy. You can choose your route on the fly and you can buy, sell and upgrade units at any time. The novelty in Anomaly 2 that provides a pretty big twist is that you can morph any of your units to suit the challenges of the current battlefield. For example, the armored vehicle with a long range gatling gun morphs into a robot with devastating short range flamethrowers. The morph mechanic does a great job at keeping you on your toes as different situations require different tactics.\n\nYour convoy can only consist of up to six vehicles and you only have five unit types (ten if you count the morph ability). The enemy towers are more varied than that. Apart from the low level towers, there are also big boss towers which deal great amounts of damage, predator towers which only appear as you’re already passing through, hacker towers that form a disruption field in which your units will attack your Commander unit and so on. As the Commander, you have four different abilities – repair units, launch a decoy, target a selected enemy and disable enemy tower. All of these enemy towers and the morph and Commander abilities come together to create a a very dynamic and at times extremely intense experience.\n\nThe campaign goes on for 14 missions across a slightly disappointing variety of environments. The first half of the game takes you across a frozen United States mid-west and New York City whereas the other half you’ll be fighting through the jungles of South America and Rio de Janeiro. Even though each mission is different enough, it all kind of boils down to snow levels and jungle levels. It also feels too short, the game only starts to really get going and then pretty soon after that it’s over.\n\nThe graphics are great, both the friendly and enemy unit designs looks really good, the weather effects and the explosions look awesome. The soundtrack doesn’t really stand out, but the sound effects really heighten the intensity of the carnage even further.\n\nAnomaly 2 successfully manages to carve out its own place in a rather saturated genre thanks to its new ideas and interesting tactical gameplay mechanics.\n\n7 OUT OF 10 (VERY GOOD)","November 30, 2013","true","9.5"," 26 of 30 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","26","30","0","0"

For example, a unit has 2 attack modes now and can be given the ability to switch between either mode at any time. Each mode has their own respective advantages and disadvantages and can be combined with the original Anomaly strategy of unit swapping, and throwing in special abilities such as smoke, repair or decoy.\n\nThe soundtrack is in my opinion, way better than the original.

Anomaly 2 is graphically a gorgeous game with a sleek interface and impressive environments, gameplay is challenging and hectic with good pacing and focus on tactics and micromanagement, not to mention a good amount of depth, while keeping it highly accessible. The campaign will likely net you a decent amount of time, there’s leaderboards for those that enjoy fighting over the number 1 spot, and the now all new versus multiplayer mode breathes more life into the title, while giving you the chance to take vengeance upon the machinery hating humans.\n\nIn the end, all I can fault it for is the annoying voice acting and lackluster story. Plus, this game would benefit a ton from a skirmish mode, which is sadly not a present feature and would be a great addition, especially were it to allow you to play as the machines versus AI. It is a fantastic game within it’s genre and you need not think long about picking this one up if these games are you cup of chaotic tea.\n\nFull review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAMCISoxbDM","November 27, 2013","true","10.4"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","15","17","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/236730/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","I will put recommended by I do so with extreme care. Anomaly is a fun tower defense game where you're on the offense while playing a bit of defense with what you got. Anomaly follows a story line where machines have taken over and humanity is struggling to survive.\n\nYou play as a commander which has the ability to move about the map as he wishes. As the commander in the field, you can quickly change tactics or use a special ability at a whim. Upon getting hurt or shot, the commander regenerates his health. The units are not as fortunate and do not have this ability. This is where the commander steps in. To heal units (or to use any special ability), the commander has to put down a regenerative power up and units have to pass over it within a certain amount of time to heal. After a few seconds, the healing pad will disappear therefore proper placement is almost everything in the game. To acquire more power up supply, the units have to destroy machines as they leave stock behind.\n\nOther commander abilities include distraction (where a distraction is put down and targeted by the machines), EMP (where the machines are unable to attack for a period of time - certainly useful for larger opponents) and aim. Vice versa, being the machines your abilities are regeneration, berserk mode, taunt and kamikaze. I haven't had the time to properly explore these modes as there isn't much of an online presence within this game. During peak hours there are a few players playing but for the most part you'll be playing the one player campaign. Planning your attack is a key feature in this game. As the commander, you are able to direct your units which way to go. You may further your progress towards the "safe zone" in the game or you may go other routes which may lead to a bonus. Alternatively, killing more robot units will give you more stock for your power ups. This gives the player more flexibility and options in how to approach the game. Although extremely simplistic, a great idea for a game to be over and above immersive.\n\nThey made the planning extremely easy to do (and easy to see the paths) and time stops when making your move. The units/vehicles themselves all each have differing abilities and 2 different forms. An assault hound for instance, can be a tank and be meant for long range battles where it's other (flame-throwing) form is meant to be in close quarters. This specific unit when in tank form fires a lot faster the more shots it takes. Other units can be used to immobilize enemies or provide shields to allies. Some units are meant for long range and deal quite a bit of damage but take a bit of time to fire again (and have smaller firing ranges). They too can switch to become close quarter fighters but each unit has it's time and place against certain opponents. Opponents can drastically change throughout the levels. You'll be fighting a nice small machine and start getting comfortable when this giant thing may come from no where. Some units fire all along a path and do consistent damage while some units need to be shot at a certain amount of times (and at a certain frequency) to evolve. There is this one shielded enemy that when fired upon quickly, will evolve into a very hard opponent.\n\nThere are ways to circumvent these situations such as using units that shoot less frequently but deal more damage to not help the evolution process. What bugs me the most about the game though is the commanders movements. Especially if you are using the keyboard, there is no fluidity in the movement/animation and it feels like you can only maneuver in 9 directions.\n\nThe visuals are quite appealing but at times seem that could have been a bit better. There are some scenery issues where instead of having a smoke animation, it will just be plain. When your units do miss a shot or fire a rocket into an enemy that has already been destroyed, that missile keeps it's course and does eventually explode when coming into contact with something (so a positive feature). The sounds are pretty good and the voice acting is suitable to what the plot presents. Nothing super outstanding in this department but the basics are met. The user interface within the game is easy to navigate.\n\nOverall, a decently good game that is worth a purchase on sale and only if you find this sort of genre interesting.\n\n\nRATING : 6.85/10\n\n\nGameplay	C+	Story / Campaign	B-	Visuals / User Interface	C+	Sounds / Music	B-	Replay-ability	C+	Overall 	C+\n\nScreenShots :\nWhat planning a route looks like.

Properly managing line-of-sight and unique unit abilities on the fly is of greater importance in this game.\n\nProbably one of the few mobile ports that I would consider a worthy PC game in its own right, both visually and in terms of gameplay. Oddly, it does not include controller support despite having fairly streamlined controls, but it plays perfectly fine with just a mouse (leyboard can optionally be used as well for triggering buffs).\n\nOverall a solid and highly polished arcade action RTS.","December 30, 2013","true","16.6"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","16","22","0","0"

Each unit actually feels useful, the transformations are genuinely good, the maps are challenging and reward twitch gameplay.\n\nThe not so good would be that the game can move faster than you can move your character around.

The shame is that it isn't as good as the original part of this series.\n\nNot from the technical standpoint, that's for sure, because Anomaly 2 is a beautiful game. It's attention to detail is really good, artistic design is great and graphical fidelity is more than enough. Even the music is good, and the voice acting is better than in the original. Only flaw on this side would be the UI, that despite being quite minimal, sometimes gets confusing. There are times when it's hard to see which health bar belongs to whom. Anyway, that's just a minor flaw.\n\nIts main problem is that it starts slow. Too slow. First levels are pretty dull. Specially if you played the previous game. It spends too much time being a tutorial. And it's a shame, because it's easy to get bored soon, too soon. Then everything gets better. Then its difficulty gets higher, new towers appear,  the game stops treating you like a newbie, and the fun begins. It's a shame it needs more than an hour to realize you are ready to roll. An hour in a game which lasts about 4 hours?  - I'm in mission 9, of 14 I think, and I've had 2.5 hours of actual gameplay, so I think 4 hours for the single player campaign is a pretty good guess. That's its mistake, and it's a big one. But once you pass trough that, things get really cool again, like in the first one.\n\nAs for the multiplayer... I won't say anything about it. I'm really not interested in it, and I didn't even tried it.\n\nDon't get me wrong, this is a good game, but it would have been better not spending so much time being a tutorial. Maybe it's just me, but I love those sequels that assume you have played the first one and/or you know what you are doing. Anyway, mechanics are not intricate or anything that justify so slow learning curve. Everything is pretty straightforward and easy to learn.\n\nDo I recommend it? Yes, but with a bit of caution. Bear in mind that it could disappoint during the first missions.","November 27, 2013","true","7.7"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","12","15","0","1"

Anomaly 2 goes a step further by giving your squad the ability to transform on the fly, expanding your options at any given time and also throws in a few more enemy towers.\n\nThe gameplay can be quite frantic as you manage your abilities in the heat of battle and scoop up additional abilities from destroyed towers, you can also pause the action to assign a new route for your troops or change the order your squad is currently in at anytime.\n\nOn a normal play through, I quickly found a squad set up that worked and while the transformations are useful at times (switching a front arc fire cannon to 360 degree missile fire for instance), I could largely switch to the preferred role and leave them be.\n\nAnomaly 2 doesn't really do anything the original didn't already do. In fact, I preferred the original over this game (both the story and gameplay balance). Anomaly 2 feels more like an expansion than a sequel in many ways and as such, I wouldn't recommend the game unless you've got and enjoyed the original Anomaly: Warzone Earth and fancy more of the same - but I'd stress the original Anomaly is indeed recommended!","January 29, 2014","false","7.4"," 31 of 51 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","31","51","0","1"

I only played the single-player campaign so that's what this review is based on. With that said, the story of the game definitely has a much broader feel compared to the previous ones as it takes place across three continents as humanity struggles against the machines for survival and a better tomorrow. It also has two endings which are determined by your decision in the final mission.\n\nThe gameplay, units and towers are pretty much the same as the previous games with one difference: each unit can transform which repurposes it for a completely different function, so the amount of different units is essentially expanded to 10, each of the five purchasable units can be switched to its counterpart by simply double-clicking it at will on the battlefield. Still, the game is fairly simple and has four difficulty modes that can be chosen before the beginning of each mission.\n\nAgain, I recommend this one over the others and perhaps the only reason to play the others is for what little storyline they have leading up to this one but it can still stand by itself because the opening cinematic can get the player up to speed on how Earth was thrown into a perpetual Winter. So I suppose it's safe to ignore the others and only play this one!","August 28, 2014","true","2.4"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

Anomaly 2 brings nothing new to the table, but what it does, it does well. For those of you that never played the first one; Anomaly is a reversed tower defense game. Meaning you create a path for your tanks and decide the order in which they drive to their destination. And, of course, you upgrade them as you see fit. You won't be building any towers. Your goal is to destroy the towers.\n\nThe player has direct control over a commander. This commander will throw decoys, tell your convoy to aim at a specific target, repair them or disable them by using an EMP. These items are limited, although killed enemies will frequently drop these as well. You have to use them strategically in order to survive, because the difficulty increases with every level you play.\n\nThe game has 12 missions. Each one should take approximately 30 minutes to complete. So in the end you'll probably end up with 7 hours of playtime, which is more than enough for a game this size.\nThe game uses a top-down perspective to keep things manageable from a strategic aspect. Anomaly 2 uses lots of colors for its enemy designs and environments, and it shows. The levels are either snowy or tropical and they both look brilliant in motion.\n\nI will gladly recommend both Anomaly games to those who like a little twist in their tower defense games.\n\n[Rating: 74/100]","May 21, 2013","true","8.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

This gameplay mechanic adds more reflexes than carefully thinking through observations of the map layouts.\n\nThe strategic elements are still there, but much easier than the 1st one. If you completed Anomaly: Warzone Earth on "Casual" then in Anomaly 2, you can just jump right in "Hardcore". Although there is a "Nightmare" difficulty, it's just Hardcore towers dealing more damage.\n\nMany sound assets are re-used from Anomaly: Korea. But the Original Soundtracks are really nice. They correctly capture the winter-appocalypse and heroic feeling, with rays of hope shining from the horizon. The OSTs are available for free on the dev's website, made my "Piotr Musial":\nhttp://www.11bitstudios.com/games/15/soundtracks\n\nMultiplayer is also fun. You can play as the Alien :)\n\nFriday, Feb 6 2014 Edit:\n#\nAfter delving deeper into the Multiplayer part, I have to say, it is really good. As you can imagine, Multiplayer pits 2 oponents against each other. One controls the Convoy (attacker) and one controls the Towers (Defender). The Convoy and its abilities mostly stay the same as singleplayer, but it's the Towers where it gets interesting. To balance out the odds, the developers added a few "twists" for the Towers.\n\nThe objective of the attacker is to destroy the defender's core structure - the Generator. Games are based on point-system. Whoever reaches the designated amount of point first is the winner, or you can win by leading the oponent by X amount of points. The attacker gains points for destroying towers and some will provide more points than the others. The defender gains points for damaging the attacker's convoy.\n\nThe Tower player will be provided with 7 available towers from the Singleplayer with the addition of the Harvesters. The Harvester is only available in Multiplayer and it harvests Abilities, Points and Carusaurum. You can have multiple Harvesters, but only one can harvest at a time.\n\nTowers' Abilities: Regen, Berserk, Taunt and Kamikaze. Additionally, similar to the Convoy's ability to morph their units, the Towers can emit Energy Waves when you double-click on them. Each tower comes with a unique type of Energy Wave that can turn the tides of the battle.\n\nMultiplayer also introduces Tech Upgrades. With each upgrade, the effect of the later one will get stronger, so planning is vital along with play styles. Amount of upgrades varies depending on the map's size.\n\nSo, what do you get out of the Multiplayer section of Anomaly 2? A whole lot, I have to say, that is if you have someone to play with. The flow of the battle always changes, there's no clear winner as the points can rack up rapidly if done right. The Tech Upgrades give both players a wide array of play styles, from Endurance, Ambush to Full-on War. All of which will create very exciting battles against friends, or foes.\n\nKeep in mind though, there are no hot keys for the Towers, so clicking a lot is expected.\n#\n\nIn the end, Anomaly 2 has proved to be "my" worthy successor to Anomaly: Warzone Earth. If you like Anomaly: Warzone Earth, then you'll probably like this game.","September 19, 2013","true","45.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

They provide a well\nimplemented leader-board, which gives a chance to see how one compares with\nother players.  The story as well as the voice acting pulls you into the\ngame, which is nice.\n\nOne nice feature to this game is being able to pick from multiple\nroutes in the levels, so you don't feel as though you are trapped.  The\nlevel of detail in available pathways gives you the option to build the\nway you want to-whether it be challenging yourself to a difficult route, or\ntrying to find the way of least resistance.\n\nEach unit you chose is affected differently by the enemy towers.\nYour units can morph into different units with different assets, which\nprovides more options.  There is a large variance in the difficulty levels,\nwhere you feel like you have to fight through the levels, and be aware of\nwhat you are facing; trying to rush through a level can result in massive\nloss of troops, and possibly death.  Overall, the combat is balanced, and\nrequires strategy in order to succeed, not just brute force.\n\nThe game is balanced and smooth, I never felt as though my time were\nwasted, it runs smoothly, and the story is done well.  The only fault I can\nfind is a lack of content with not enough missions.  I have no problem\nrecommending this game to those who enjoy replaying missions to get  better\nscores.\n\nThis is a summary of what I talk about in the video, I am a YT'er not a Blogger\nThanks for your viewership and support for more videos check click here.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho","October 25, 2014","true","8.9"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

I expected much from this game as I loved the 1st one, but the devs made the mistake of so many games by adding to much that the fun get's replaced by the frustration. Adding the morph and way the enemies spawn so close to you that no mission can be resolved from a first time (not talking about tutorial levels) you hace to load last checkpoint so many times until you know exactly where the enemy will spawn so you can plan what mechs you will need at what time. When a certain type may not fire at an enemy you need to sell it otherwise it transforms into deadly machine. When your commander is not close enough to a unit and says we half to dead then it's already to late to get there...

(I pretty much never get excited for Indie games)\n\nAnomaly follows up the story of Anomaly Warzone Earth. Earth's been invaded by aliens, you're going to lead a bunch of vehicles to blow up towers. If one has ever played custom maps of Tower Defence in Warcraft 3 or what me not, you'll find it pretty similar.\n\nExcept this time, you're on the attacking side.\n\nUnits can morph about, giving more depth in the strategy used to blow up the towers. For example, a unit has 2 attack modes now and can be given the ability to switch between either mode at any time. Each mode has their own respective advantages and disadvantages and can be combined with the original Anomaly strategy of unit swapping, and throwing in special abilities such as smoke, repair or decoy.\n\nThe soundtrack is in my opinion, way better than the original. But then again, Anomaly had a great soundtrack to begin with.\n\nFor its low indie game price, I'd recommend that strategy / tower defence lovers go for the game. It's fun, addictive and equally hair pulling at the same time in various situations.\n\nIF you haven't had enough of Anomaly, there's always Anomaly Korea, the original Warzone Earth and even the mobile campaign on Steam to purchase!","November 9, 2013","true","1.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Which is great idea, except that instead of getting to pick what troops you're going to send against the defenders each wave, you instead just watch a small convoy of vehicles that NEVER STOPS sloooowly crawling forward (presumably the initial alien attack destroyed the gear shift factories so all vehicles are stuck going 10 km/h) and occasionally drop buffs on them. Wait, no, that was the first game. This game copies an element that was in the console versions of the first game, where you run around (about three times faster than the vehicles!) as a commander and draw the towers' fire and stuff, just to really drive home the feeling of frustration and powerlessness. You know, just to make it absolutely clear that you aren't a badass warlord choosing which troops deserve the honor of attacking the pitiful defenders, cowering in their towers.","June 11, 2014","false","1.4"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

The core gameplay of guiding your units around maze-like streets, while using abilities to help defeat enemy towers, remains intact. There are new units, each of which can morph between two different forms at will. For example, the artillery unit can either fire straight ahead at long range, or 360 degrees at medium range. This adds more depth and makes it easier to adjust tactics mid-mission, to take advantage of the new enemy towers' weaknesses. The presentation of graphics, music, voice acting and story is all very good. The campaign took me around 6.5 hours, and although I'm disappointed there's no singleplayer skirmish mode, there is multiplayer to add replayability. The controls work great with mouse and I didn't notice any bugs.

It is not necessary to play these beforehand (as there's not that much "plot" going on in these games, let's be honest), but it is recommend (especially in the beginning, as there's a reference or two thrown in there...).\nAs a sequel, it has quite a lot of things in common with its predecessors: you command a convoy and can choose it's composition and path through the alien towers, which you destroy for objectives and currency, which you use to buy and upgrade units... And the commander, which you control directly, is able (and often has to) deploy abilities (buffs or debuffs) on the battlefield to help the convoy through crucial enemy chokepoints.\nThis is at least twice as fun as it sounds. :-)\nThis entry in the series has a few major changes though, like morphing (and different) units, different abilities and a more elaborated presentation of its plot. And in the end there's a plot twist with a crucial choice.\n\nOh, and as a note concerning difficulty: there's no quick save, but check points you may "drive through" as often as you deem necessary. I played through in casual mode, which was not too hard - but you had to react and adapt to the battle, so it was still fun.

The story is a little cliche but the voice acting is well done, the artwork in cutscenes(especially the intro video) is interesting and lastly the graphics are beautiful to look at although sometimes too much ♥♥♥♥ gets blown up and can lose track of where your commander is at lol.\n\nGameplay generally isn't too complex to intimidate casual players but its complex enough to satisfy the hardcore players(like me) and the real trick to winning is ALWAYS set your unit path beforehand to the fastest route possible with the least amount of enemies otherwise you will be pointlessly adjusting it as you go which is only necessary on certain levels.\n\n\nI haven't tried the multiplayer yet so my review is only about the single player though I highly recommend this especially if you get it on sale.","January 28, 2014","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The core gameplay of guiding your units around maze-like streets, while using abilities to help defeat enemy towers, remains intact. There are new units, each of which can morph between two different forms at will. For example, the artillery unit can either fire straight ahead at long range, or 360 degrees at medium range. This adds more depth and makes it easier to adjust tactics mid-mission, to take advantage of the new enemy towers' weaknesses. The presentation of graphics, music, voice acting and story is all very good. The campaign took me around 6.5 hours, and although I'm disappointed there's no singleplayer skirmish mode, there is multiplayer to add replayability. The controls work great with mouse and I didn't notice any bugs. I think this developer deserves to be rewarded for their efforts with a full price purchase.","May 19, 2013","true","14.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I had never played a game in the series and I had only gotten this one when it was in a bundle. I was thoroughly impressed. The concept is simple; it’s a tower defense game from the other perspective. You are not the towers, you are the assaulting force. Unlike most tower defense games, however, you are not a seemingly endless wave but rather an elite group of vehicles.\n\nEach map has you select your vehicles before moving out. You are given a set amount of money that you can spend on new vehicles, different vehicles, or upgrading your existing vehicles. You then map out your course through the level and get to shooting. You can also morph your vehicles to be better suited for the fight ahead. As you defeat enemies you pick up powerups that you can use to help your vehicles out in a difficult fight. Should you want to change up your team mid level you can do so. The gameplay seems balanced and rather unique.\n\nTo not give too much away, the story is essentially that aliens have taken over and you are a part of a resistance movement. The story seemed pretty alright to me but wasn’t a real focus. This game really shines in gameplay.\n\nPerhaps the only negative I can think of for this game is that there isn’t a ton of depth here. There are only about 5 or so enemy types and not a whole lot of vehicle types. Everything that is there seems pretty great so perhaps the developers didn’t want to overcomplicate the game and risk hurting what was working.\n\nOverall, this is a great twist on the tower defense genre and definitely worth a look.","February 10, 2015","true","14.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Too much time.\n-Certain item drops CHANCE seems fixed from enemy turrets, allowing each chapter to have its balance of power through item use.\n-Single player is pretty short, although chapter in the latter prove to be time taking (especially on hardest difficulty), you can usually speed up in-game. (Which most games usually does by teaching you all the relevant stuff in following chapters and leave you the next 3/4 parts of the chapter to your own with a specific condition or a sort)\n-Multiplayer introduce further stuff that reveal more different combination of strategic gameplay for players to compete on each other with, unfortunately the population is not that many to play with since the online queue takes ages.\n\nit could be a casual browser, it could even be a sort of custom map on some game engine, but Anomaly series prioritize its awesome graphic heavily to have its own, and when I say custom, I view this game as a mini-game genre. Overall, although many of its features are still limited in for different strategical elements, I'd still recommend it for people to play the thrill of quickpace planning with their friends together.","November 17, 2015","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The main goal is to get through the levels via the route you choose yourself. There's a fair amount of tactical depth: you can get up to 6 units in your squad, and upgrade each of them up to 3 times. You can transform them in the middle of battle to change their mode of attack to deal with different kinds of towers. Meanwhile you have to run around to repair your vehicles, control where they shoot and disable or distract enemy towers. The game is about 6 hours long.","November 3, 2015","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has a great way of making you feel OP and then instantly killing your so called OP set up. I love it. With out giving anything away I will say you will get frustrated with how much fun and stress this game will give you. Its not often I find a game that can make me so mad I storm off to cool down just to come right back an hour later to try again.  I love how it gets your full attention right from the start.\n\nThe biggest thing to get used to in this game is the low amount of units you think you have to choose from. I cannot tell you how many times I forget I can morf my units. This single twist has not only made the depth of play greater it has made your tactics a more thought out part of the game. No longer can you just pick the op final unit and just roll over everything. I tried and you can still die even on the normal diff setting. You will learn to use the morf so much that your scouting ahead looking for the location you will morf each unit based on the enemies you will face. Great job devs.","November 20, 2015","true","12.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've played some TD games in past, but this is really good game, pretty graphic and nice music, also the story is OK for this kind of game... even maybe more then ok. If you like tower defenses even a bit, just give it a try and you wouldn't regret..","November 21, 2015","true","11.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I did not play the previous games, so I dont know how new the different enemy units are, but they offer a nice variety of skills and require quite some distinct tactics to beat them. Game is not so easy, you will wipe several times in normal until you understand the various weaknesses of the units. Story is quite good, a bit short but offers a lot of variety. Therefore, highly recommended if you want to play an unusual Tower and Defense game!","March 27","true","12.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
