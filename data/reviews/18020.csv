It boasts solidly designed and enjoyable RPG elements, with a light and hilarious story.  This is a good pick-up for any casual RPG fans out there looking for some lighthearted fun.\n\nLike the first game, technically, this is a parody game— but to be honest it plays better than many modern “real” RPGs that are emerging from the indie realm.  It plays like an old-school, turnbased-combat RPG, complete with leveling-up elements and a mild form of gear upgrading.  The gameplay is definitely fun and the RPG elements will keep you addicted to the progression.  You will find yourself striving to reach that next milestone of development as you play through the hilarious campaign.\n\nOn the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness, Episode Two is a Penny Arcade game. The story is fun and funny; it doesn’t take itself too seriously.  It is very lighthearted and the game is packed with hilarious and immature humor.  The characters are likeable, and cartoonish.  The art style is charming and fits the atmosphere of the game perfectly.  It all comes together as a very comic-like production.\n\nThis is a good second chapter to the first game.  There is really nothing drastically different in this one compared to the first, but that’s not really a bad thing because the first was pretty good.  As they say: “if it ain’t broke…”\n\nI strongly recommend playing both Episode One and Episode Two in order and together, as they are more two parts to a whole than they are two separate games.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","November 28, 2013","true","6.3"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

'Cause the protagonist get bored of rakes and start hitting robots 'n crazy men with a hoe. Yup.\n\nSame charming characters, same great art style, same great and yet ridiculously funny story as the first episode.\n\nThere is only one thing that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off in the gameplay: the boring yet easy  brain mini-game . Impossible to skip because a main story mission, good only to waste time and make the game look 30 minutes much longer.\n\nFinal Score: 7,5/10\n\nExcept that, the whole game is really fun, I think I said that too many times. Get this one too if you want to play the whole series!\n..That now it's like the very first Final Fantasy style. Oh well, it's still nice to me.","January 23, 2014","true","8.1"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

However, the developer's work ethic was weak and it shows.  Besides abandoning the series unfinished, leaving it for a different developer that mixed things up a little too much, they abandoned fixing the bugs on the Mac verision and instead removed it from the store.  Now Mac users have paid money for nothing, because the game won't even start.","October 28, 2014","false","6.3"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

Once again, you (your character from the first episode can be imported) team up with 1920's-era Gabe & Tycho to stop an apocolyptic menace. Everything I said in my recommendation of the first game once again holds here, because this is pretty much the exact same game - literally, it uses the same engine, combat, mechanics, style, etc. The only things that have changed are the locations and enemies. So just take my previous review, replace "slaughtering hobos, clowns and mimes" with "slaughtering mental patients, pretentious rich folks and giant spiders", and there ya go. But that's not to say there's anything wrong with this - it works in an episodic format. So once again, if you are a fan of PA (their humor or characters) and adventure-RPGs, this is worth a look, despite the rough edges. I'm now looking forward to the recently announced Episode Three!","May 28, 2012","true","8.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Tedious pixel hunting quests, overly difficult QTE combat, and a boring story with little focus really kills the potential this game had. Although it continues off from the previous game (game mechanic and level-wise), you lose all your old skills for some reason. More frustration comes from a long fetch quest chain that rewards you with a jail cell. Combat is absurd with enemies getting mountains of health plus free "interrupt" heals, removing strategy from combat and requiring you to just pile everything onto one enemy at time. The last boss is a multi-part "gimme" fight, that ends in a lame adventure game last fight that requires no skill and cuts out your party.\n\nOverall this was really disappointing, boring and tedious. Just pick up the first one and pretend ep2 doesn't exist.","September 10, 2012","false","7.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

And as such, here's a review!\nStory- You return as your created character (if you wish) and in trying to rebuild your home after saving the world, Gabe and Tycho return (again destroying your house) and beg for your aid in their latest supernatural case. Again, you now travel around the city looking for a new place to live while saving the world from a tyranical (and fruit-horny robot god). Again, following the same gothic, lovecraftian style of comedy and horror, the story draws you into its world and its characters. But, as in the first game, it will only do so for a couple of hours before the credits roll. A-\nGraphics- The game is exactly the same as its predicessor. Nothing truly great but works well with what it's got. D+\nSound- The voice actor for the narrator still does a terrific job and still has that dry wit. Music is recycled from the first game, not a bad thing but nothing really new either. C-\nGameplay- Still needs a controller option and still suffers the same problems. The battles are similar but the mini games that powers up the special attacks are different, which is good. Not an improvement but switches things up a bit. C\nOverall- I kinda got lazy with this review but really, it is a continuation of the first game so I really can't say anything new about it. It's fun, and I like the fact that you can transfer your created character from the first game. Also, it does keep you intrested in it and makes you want to see what happens in the next episode.

If you enjoyed Ep 1, you'll enjoy Ep 2, although how you enjoy it is questionable. The game is about an hour longer than the first but there are still three major areas (don't believe the map). The Special moves are harder to pull off and require more practice as well. The difficulty curve is fine tuned as well to be a lot more steady as compared to the first which I really enjoyed. Once again, play this game without looking anything up first.\n\nThat said, the loading times are unforgivable (a minute if not more). The first game had barely any load times and this game (I believe) runs on the same engine and to make matters worse, you'll be going between areas A LOT. Plus, the game is still short. The final boss is a puzzle boss and anticlimatic at best, not at all like the boss from the last game.\n\nAlthough RPG lovers will enjoy this game more easily than the first game, it feels a little more disappointing. Still a fun game though.","April 9, 2012","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
