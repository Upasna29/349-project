Yes, it's ugly as sin. I could say "at least it's not pixel art" but that's just damning with faint praise. And the music is even worse.\n\nBut this captures the heart of Mystery Dungeon style games so well.\n\nFor those who don't know what that means, Mystery Dungeon is a brand of Japanese roguelikes dungeon crawlers (You may have seen the Shiren, Pokemon, or Etrian flavors). What makes them stand out is how simple they are compared to the western brand of roguelike. There are not six fiddly stats and 40 rings, scrolls, and wands to manage nor are there 40 fiddly tricks to have to cover like keeping a wand of fire to scribble galadriel at opportune moments. You do not have to memorize 40 pages of spoilers and have "blessed +2 gray dragon scale mail" tattooed on your forearm.\n\nIn exchange for all that, the genre focuses more on gamey style abilities. The wands and abilities you find control enemy pacing, placement, movement, etc. And when there is a horde of monsters bearing down on you with a monster that can paralyze you and another that can drain your levels, your brain will be tested just like the best of roguelikes.\n\nSo what MD offers is something more innately intuitive and accessible than the overwrought and overfiddly roguelikes you may be accustomed to, but one still quite difficult. If the western flavor is an enormous wargame run by steely-eyed grognards with fearsome neckbeards ready to debate tactics from the galactic wars of the far future to the Civil War, MD is closer to chess.\n\nVoyage to Farland is almost a straight reskin of the DS Shiren game. Every ability, every trick is there, with its own spin on balancing. If you can get past the atrocious art style, you will find an excellent homage to a roguelike flavor that just is not well-represented on PC. Complete with Shiren's love of secrets and inventory management, but with different enemy design, pacing, and balancing, it is a wonderful homage from a fellow who is clearly as moved by Shiren as I am.","June 14, 2015","true","3.9"," 21 of 30 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","21","30","0","0"

While the graphics are cute the game itself is extremely challenging. If you liked Shiren the Wanderer or any of the Torneko games then this game is for you!","June 4, 2015","true","2.7"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

It can be brutally hard even right at the start though.\n\nAs for the style of game it is, look to Pokemon Mystery Dungeon, Chocobo's Mysterious Adventure et al: basically Japanese console roguelikes.","June 2, 2015","true","0.8"," 12 of 25 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","12","25","0","0"

Fight your way through the cute hordes of ultimate destruction and defeat the witch.\n\nHas nice retro graphics, some different game types, and sounds/music.
