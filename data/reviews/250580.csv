Let's neglect the fact he outright cheated the original music composer out of pay, after he put personal pursuits on hold because he was told he'd get paid.  Let's neglect the fact that the game got taken down off steam, bought out by a new publisher, and brought back to steam.\n\nIts still an obsolete version of Ziggurat.  While there are differences, in just about every regard Ziggurat is a superior game and your money would be better spent on that.

I have no interest in reinvestigating the current situation, so take it with a grain of salt. The developer has released updates since this review was posted.\n\nThe game itself is not bad. I've found it decently enjoyable. Not a huge amount of replay value, but I got to the end once. The problem with Paranautical Activity is the developer.\n\nThe developers have continuously insulted and mocked people who bought their game. In addition, they have been less than honest. The game was marketed for over a year as having co-op incoming (and as of this review, the store page says the developers are still working on it), yet that feature was suddenly canceled. The developers insist they have been working hard on bugfixes and content updates, yet have not released anything, even missing a promised deadline by over two months (patch is yet to be released as of this review). Furthermore, the devs have been silent on the forums (when not aggresively insulting the people who bought their game) and insist you should visit their website, where they will keep people updated; visiting their webiste reveals no new news in two months, and the last message was just an apology for a delay (that has still not been resolved). And when fans have the nerve to say they aren't being treated fairly? The devs say people are "entitled." Do not buy this game, do not support this kind of rude immaturity from developers, do not support Early Access games that are deceptively marketed.","May 6, 2014","false","9.7"," 521 of 674 people (77%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","77","521","674","4","31"

I did *not* expect this game to be so addictive and absolutely satisfying. A long-overdue and well-executed fast-paced, circle-strafing, old school twitch shooter feel with a lot of elements very much like Binding of Isaac (a very good thing, and I mention the likeness only to its credit.) Different starting characters/builds with different stats and starting weapons to choose from, randomized/procedurally generated rooms and floors, health/armor/gold/bomb drops off enemies, shops on each floor, tons of unique personal upgrades to buy or earn at the end of each floor, etc. With even more content to come, and co-op multiplayer on the way (dear god yes!), I haven't been this pleased with and addicted to any indie title since FTL.\n\nMost importantly, the core controls and mechanics are an absolute joy. The pace and precision of the controls and the action feel absolutely spot-on. This is something many games destined for mediocrity have overlooked in lieu of trying to do everything else. When it comes down to it, the core mechanics, the precision and pacing of the controls of any shooter are at *least* half of what we either enjoy or can't stand about them. And more often than not, we barely even consciously realize that, if at all. Paranautical Activity absolutely nails it in terms of *exactly* how a shooter like this should feel, and it's a feel that is too rare these days. As a pure gaming experience, this one is a huge breath of fresh air.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aphexplague/recommended/250580/","aphexplague","Genji's sweet ass (Pesuto)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aphexplague/","393 products in account","I should probably have seen the Early Access reviews before purchasing it, but this is where you get a bit more savvy about positive reviews than negative ones.\n\nAnd frankly, this game isn't too bad. It's just not... fun and doesn't feel too interesting. Think Doom and Binding Of Isaac, but with a worse Health system, weapons that feel powerless at times, and surprisingly bad frame drops at times.\n\nParanautical Activity (Deluxe Atonement, for its re-release after the minor controversy), is a rogue-lite FPS game, that seems to take notes from Doom and Binding Of Isaac. Yet, it seems to do it in ways that work against the game. While it does use some of the things (fast paced shooting, randomized rooms and floors, varying stats on each character), it doesn't use it well.\n\nWeapons feel quite good to use, although some of them feel rather weak. The shotgun, from my point of view, felt like the biggest let-down of all the weapons, with the bow being powerful and one or two-hitting enemies, with no problem.\n\nPower-ups feel nice too but with next to no proper explination as to what they do, when you pick them up, leave you to guess what they do, for whatever situation you're about to plummet into, with said power-up.\n\nEnemies are... alright. Mostly tedious to deal with, since some range from simple "fire a bolt, wait for a while, rinse and repeat" to "'bullet hell'-like spam". Surprisingly, the most annoying enemy I faced was the floor sharks. Why? Tank-y characters can't dodge well, and with the floor sharks, I've ended up being juggled by them, shooting them with a shotgun that did abysmal damage, until I either died or completed the room that way.\n\nLevels are pretty much the same square box, with randomised preset props, and enemies are dumped in when you enter. Nothing to write home about, except for what could amount to some problem with moving under staircases. Ended up getting stuck there, which has broken the flow of gameplay, quite a lot. There also seems to be some odd dissonance with the enemies that spawn in some rooms? Sometimes you get enemies who spawn in there, who get stuck in parts of the level geometry and just kinda... sits there.\n\nThe characters have different spawn weapons, health and speed, meaning that you have some variety in what you can do and can't do. And by variety, it boils down to how far you can get with the fast characters. I mentioned above that the tank-y characters are slow, and even the extra health they have, just makes them a sitting duck until they die. Along with some of them getting weapons which would be ideal for fast characters, since they promote "attack-retreat" tactics, they work against the character, requiring them risk taking hits, which they most likely will, to pump in shots that don't feel like they do much. Compared to the bow or the sicle, the shotgun feels like the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pistol you throw out the window, as soon as you see anything remotely non-pistol like.\n\nThe bosses are... okay. They look interesting, but their design and looks are pretty much meaningless, since most of them just fire shots are you, non-stop until they spawn enemies or do some third thing that makes them slightly different from each other. And, honestly, they could be interesting if most of them didn't feel like the same boss. They just move around the area and shot, not really doing anything else, than the animation their set. Which sucks, cause the bosses I fought, looked really interesting.\n\nThe game itself, is it worth it, even after all that I complained about? For some people, if you've run out of rogue-lite games, akin to Ziggurat, it could be. If there's some more tweaks to the game, such as a revamped health system, characters and weapons being buffed, as well as some changes to make bosses less dependent on luck or power-ups, it can be a very fun game. Also the font is pretty damn ugly to look at, in the menu. And the menu looks really amateurish, which is kinda sad, considering a lot of indie games do a lot to make the menus look presentable.\n\nWas I satisfied with the product? No. I felt like I bought a game that could've benefitted from more time in Early Access, especially now that we have a new dev team who works on the game. Hopefully, some future patches can make them game more fun to play and less annoying to deal with.\n\nDo I recommend it? As you saw above, I don't. If you want to jump into the genre of rogue-like or rogue-lite or whatever the cool kids call it, look for a game like The Binding Of Isaac, Ziggurat, or look up some games within that genre on your own. If you really want it, prepare for a game that you may dislike or find too tedious to keep playing.","February 18, 2015","false","0.5"," 174 of 246 people (71%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","71","174","246","4","2"

But then again, I was born into the N64/PS era, and didnt get into gaming until the GC/PS2/Xbox era, by which time Doom, Quake, and UT had run its course. So i've never really been able to experiance the "twitch shooter", only the tryhard big-budget military horsecrap.\n\nUntil now.\n\nThis game has what most modern shooters don't: a sense of speed, INCREDIBLY tight controls, and... dare I say it... fun? This is the most fun I've had in a while, probably since i was a starry-eyed kid playing Sonic Adventure 2 Battle. Enough exposition, let's get into it.\n\nThis game doesnt seem to have a story, except what you can glean from the enviroment, the enimies, and the title of the game. Here's what I've discovered (speculated) so far... (i've only made it to level 5 at this point) you are onboard a nazi submarine filled with demons and demonic sea life. Why? Who knows... and who cares? Just stop thinking and shoot what moves.\n\nSpeaking of shooting, the gameplay. Its just sublime. Sublime, and insanely difficult. This game follows up on its promise to harken to rogue-like games (is that how you say it?), with randomly generated floors (specific rooms are premade, but increase in variety as you progress), a Spelunky-esque shop, and a powerup system that brings to mind The Binding of Isaac. The game features permadeath, dying will restart you at floor one. Do not pass go. Paranautical Activity has several different classes, each with its own primary gun, maximum health pool, firing rate (an attribute determined more by the gun than the character), and movement speed. From the shotgun toting Tank, to the Insanely quick but flimsy David Bowie (armed only with a crossbow), there is a playstyle for all kinds of people here. Regardless of your class, all of the primary weapons in the game have infinite ammo, which i personally enjoy, as this game is stressful enough without having to manage it.\n\nWhen you're not shooting in PA, you're going to be running and jumping for your life. All enemy attacks are either projectile attacks with travel time or rushing you down in melee. Mostly the projectiles. You are tasked with avoiding damage at all costs, which can become rather hectic in later stages of this game. Your character, regardless of class can jump a good hight, and changes directions midair on a dime.\n\nThe Graphics are kind of minimal, but I really dig the lighting system. All ingame models are voxel-based, with the enviroment textures looking similar to old-school Doom games. The Soundtrack is surprisingly good, and fits the game well, albeit being a bit repetitive.\n\nAll this, and the game is still in beta, and it can only go upwards from here. The devs are talking about adding in co-op (PRAISE THE LAWD) as well as finetuning the gameplay experiance.\n\nThis game does have a few bugs. Which is to be expected, as it is a beta, but bugs and minimalist graphics cannot hold back this pure, unadultered, virgin, twitch shooter experiance. Even in its current incomplete state, this game is an easy 8/10, and with solid netcode (fingers crossed), greater room variety early, and maybe a few more playable classes (one that starts with the M4!?!?) this could be propelled to a 9.5 to a 10, easily.\n\nTHAT BEING SAID. This game is not for everyone. It is difficult. Its inherent mouse acceleration can be very tough to get used to. If you dont like shooters but like Rogue-Likes you wont like this game. If you like shooters but hate Rogue-Likes, you probably wont like this game. In my honest opinion, this game is pointed at a very specific pocket of gamers, which quite honestly I see as a good thing. Too many game devs these days (mostly AAA ones) are spending way too much time trying to appease everyone (which is impossible) which simply results in a watered-down product, a shadow of what it could have been. YOU WILL NOT SEE THIS HERE. If you dig a challenge, love old-school movement-based shooters, AND like the randomless of Rogue-Likes... welcome home.","December 2, 2013","true","11.7"," 159 of 251 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","159","251","0","3"

I have Hundreds of hours between those three games (Doom 1 2 and BOI) and this is nothing like those. Not every FPS with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics is like Doom (BTW doom was not a Volumetric Pixle game it used sprites and was the graphical equivalant of Crysis for its time) and not every Rogue-lite is like Isaac (which is the KING of Rogue-lite).\n\nCombat feels slow and boring (strafe, shoot, rinse, repeat), I mean you have to keep moving but it does not feel fast paced, just lame. The optimization is poor at best. Someone explain to me why skyrim runs at 4k resolution no problem but this game bounces between 50 and 600fps constantly. Weapons are uninspired and EXTREMLY limited. Powerups require cash and you rarely have enough for anything decent unless you save and gimp yourself.\n\nIf you want a FPS rogue-lite that doesnt run like crap and play like an autistic version of the two games everyone seems to be equating this to, try Eldritch. Or if you want to truly play a game like Doom or Isaac, just get those games, they are both infinitely better.","February 16, 2015","false","2.1"," 113 of 182 people (62%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","62","113","182","8","6"

It is not polished, it has many bugs, it has really poor optimization. And the devs first mocked with people, then mocked with Gabe. then got kicked out, then sold the game to a different publisher in its unfinished state.\n\nYeah aim of the developers is not reached since they lack basic courtesy. Anyway, what was that aim? It was simply replicating BoI in FPS setting. Shops, bombs, most of the skills and upgrades were designed on this. This is not bad, since BoI is really fun, but this does not add anything original to the genre either. Every addition came from some other roguelike, e.g Ghost from Spelunky. It is good knowing that developers also like the games I like and many likes, but a collection of features from some well known very well executed games to build a buggy, unfinished mess is completely different thing.\n\nWhat is the original side of the game? To be fair it has two. First, its art style. User interface and menus are poorly designed, and game plays like the worst possible Unity example once can imagine, so expect stutters when passing through different menus. But in game voxel art is not that bad, and it feels unique. Also the soundtracks are not that bad, and distinct from other roguelike games. But being unique is not always a good thing, check some gameplay videos first, you may not like dubstep at the end.\n\nI am not a good FPS player, so I did not reach past floor 3, but it is not necessary to finish the game to see that this game is abandonware. Any obvious no brainer bug will be there until eternity while new publishers find publishing the new version with a gameplay video and a pdf file rather than some content wise and bug crushing patch.\n\nIf u LOVE FPS and also LOVE binding of isaac, u may enjoy this a little, if u also are good with ignoring its bugs. If your feeling towards one of those two is more mediocre, u are advised to go and play some other FPS-roguelike. I can also advice you some other FPS roguelikes, since I have tried many:\n\n- Ziggurat\n-Tower of Guns\n- Fancy Skulls","February 28, 2015","false","4.9"," 70 of 109 people (64%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","64","70","109","4","0"

Also the level design is bland. It's basically Binding of Isaacs boxes attached to each other where you clear a room to go to the next one until you find the floor exit. So no keycards and secrets.

After that discussion caused by Valve labeling the game as "Released" instead "Early-Access", the game got removed from steam and re-added 4 months after under "Digerati marketing" , a distribution company. But sadly since then (feb '15, and to be precise the last update it's dated Oct '14) the game hasn't been updated once.\n\nSo, before further talking let's go on with the recension.\n\nAppearance:\nGraphics: 2/5\nMenu appearance it's not one of the best. Also in-game huds are way too "simple" in their appearance despite their "Cubic 32-bit" style. A graphical enhancement would be really appreciated.\n\nSounds: 3/5\nNot so much to say about sounds, the music it's really nice but sorta repetitive during the whole floor, maybe add a boss and mini-boss music?\n\nGameplay:\nClasses: 4/5\nParanautical Activity grants the player a bunch of playable classes that can get unlocked by completing achievements and each one of them it's really different in their weapon and stats.\n\nMovements: 5/5\nThe character it's really easy to control thanks also to items pickup that grants you the ability to double-jump etc.. Watch out for snowy levels and falling platforms! ;)\n\nLongevity: 3/5\nNot so much to say here neither, the game it's really fun but after a while playing it becomes slightly repetitive.\n\nBugs: 2/5\nAs already said in the introduction the was supposed to be an Early-Access instead of a release, it has a lot of bugs and glitch like Monsters getting stuck under staircases, double doors, glitch with powerups etc... But despite that i won't give a lot of weight to this voice because the game it was and still is a beta.\n\nOVERALL: 3/5\n\nWould I recommend this game? Yes. Would I recommend it for 9€? No.\nIt's a really fun game but developers ditched it by not updating it anymore, It's a really nice mixture of Fps and Roguelike and definitely fun to play if you enjoy both genres. But still.. in its conditions it's not really worthed 9€ if you want to get it, i suggest you to wait until it'll be in sale.\n\n~Matt","June 23, 2015","false","14.3"," 59 of 97 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","59","97","0","0"

Slow updates plague many genres like this, and while I may have bought this game I do not reccomend this game for anyone who is fans of "roguelike-likes", as you may be highly dissapointed right now with the level of content (many alpha/beta roguelikes suffer from this) before finishing the game. There is little playability besides different weapons, which can (and should be) purchased from the shop on a playthough, and the enemies have little to no variation besides melee enemies, enemies with straight shot, and enemies with a slight homing shot.\nNeedless to say, the devs need to change the, "We're planning to add multiplayer co-op in the very near future, as well as a ton more content, and of course some bug fixes and polish.” to "We're on Valve time only we're not Valve."\n\nMore seriously, promising content that trickles out very slowly (last update was in October, after I purchased the game) when being in the early access is little more than getting a functional beta with less than beta content. The game has nothing that sets it apart from many other alpha/beta Roguelike-likes either, leaving it barren, not to mention the graphics are currently (hopefully) developer art, and will be just a bit more developed, but I'm not holding my breath.","December 22, 2013","false","9.4"," 25 of 42 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","25","42","0","0"

The developers advertised the game as having certain prominent features upcoming for several months after they had cancelled development, leading to people buying the game under false pretences. Of course, early access games are always a risk, and things can change, but to continue promising a feature long after they have given up on it is not something that should be accepted or encouraged, even for an Early Access game. That isn't part-and-parcel of what we should accept from early access, it's outright misleading, and an abuse of the Early Access system.","July 1, 2014","false","3.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Just as the developers have never really shown love and in the middle of this conflict between the players and the developers is a game that had unlimited potential. It's a sad sight to see it die over something as lame as the dev's folding on the co-op support. For me personally, no biggie, yeah it sucks but that just means devs need to step up and deliver something spectacular to their backers for their own short commings on their promises.\n\nI understand the trials and tribulations that a developer goes through to see their vision come to life, another reason why it is sad to see it die but this is still no reason the devs need to go on the offensive or even the defensive as the backlash should have been expected from the community. A more inteligent tact would have been to go back to the drawing board, like maybe consider scrapping their developed engine because of it's short commings and using an outside engine, as there are a lot of free ones to choose from. The point is that, there were alternatives to how this could've been handled, but instead of putting their energy into fixing it, their efforts went into some kind of 'fight the community' damage control and broke it so bad that it is now unfixable. Thus, the world is less one good game.\n\nIn all, the game wasn't half bad. It's a great idea but it needs a lot of polishing, the random generating algorithms need fixing and even though, technically that this game is still in early access (of which my review is based on) at this point, needing the polishing and fixes is not a good thing, as I have felt the heart leave this game a long time ago.\n\nI hate saying these words but "I cannot recommend".","July 23, 2014","false","1.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

I love first person shooters like Quake and Doom, and rougue likes such as Isaac a ton, so when I saw that this game was a mix of those with a cool art style, I eagerly purchased it. I regret not refunding it.\nThis game  isn't fun, and, my god, is it slow. Games like Doom or The Binding of Isaac are fast paced, with constant action mixed into the strategy of play they demand, but this game, is  not that. Every room is a chore to get through, as it takes a few seconds to get into the action, which boasts a combat system with a  wide variety limited choice of weaponry that gives little diversity in game play. The combat itself is clunky and isn't satisfying to attack. Killing enemies is satisfying, but only in the sense that you'll be thinking "thank god I finished this room, I can only hope that the next isn't the same thing", and are slightly relieved to be done. Speaking of next rooms, they might as well all be the same. I feel as if I am not exploring or getting through an adventure, as I am doing nothing but repeating the same mundane gameplay of the last challenge. This game can be summed up in one word:  boring.\n\nDo not buy this game. Do not support it's jerk of a developer who wants to kill the guy who put his game up for sale. Do not encourage games like this to be made again. Do not waste your time or money. Buy The Binding of Isaac. Buy Doom. Buy Ziggurat. Buy Tower of Guns. Buy Devil Daggers.

The lack of variety is evident ever since your first playthrough.\n\nMost of the weapons in the game feel rather powerless or too slow. Even when they're actually effective, like the demoman's grenade launcher, they still feel unsatisfying and awkward due to the lack of sound effects and impact.

The game is terribly punishing with your small health pool and terrible weapon selection. The controls and gameplay are designed so that the player has to run around and constantly kite enemies hoping their shots will land and hit the enemies. The controls and gameplay are clunky and all the rooms the player goes through seem so repetitive as they are all boxes with different props and obstacles thrown in.  There are items that you can purchase to upgrade but the game does nothing to tell you what does the item do. Most of the time you just purchase an item only to find out that it has negative effects! Also, the difficulty of the game seems odd, some enemies and bosses are really easy and on the other hand some are really difficult. I did about 10 runs, and they were all very similar just with different bosses and the 2nd level boss usually takes me down each time.

The game is ok, though it rarely gets any updates. The develpers also see it fit ban posts reporting some bugs in the game and in some cases constructive criticism. All in all the most annoying thing which the developers and the moderators of thier community hub have in the past, was give positive confirmation of multiplayer getting added, claimming for months that it would be in the "next update".  However this never happend because of a "Technical issue" even though they had been "working" on the game for almost a full six to eight months without a single update, bug fix, or patch. After which they claimed they never prommissed any such thing, instead of appologizing to thier customers. They have been one of the best examples of how a game development company should not be run. Ignoring feedback, false advertising, and, one of the worst things to do in my opinion, acting as if it isn't thier falt and not taking any blame about thier short-commings in thier developement.\n\n\nI Do not recommend this game to anyone, because nobody should support people like this and feed the ego of a delusional game developer.

I think I've cleared enough floors and played enough to really judge my experience.\n\nThis title aspires to be a throwback to the '90s with an emphasis on constantly moving, strafing around enemies and shooting from the hip. You go from room to room, kill all the enemies within and make it to the boss of the floor before taking the elevator down to the next. Repeat this many times over, with the rooms that you fight in seeming very much the same and the annoying music blaring at all times.\n\nThat is Paranautical Activity in a nutshell.\nA rougelike take on Doom/Quake this is not. In fact, with all the open seeming environments I was stuck in, it felt more like a grossly simplified voxel take on Unreal Tournament with much less mayhem and enjoyment. Needless to say, I don't quite like this game at the present. It may change for the better due to it being early access, but I think the core designs are already in place and the devs won't flip turn them upside down anytime in the future.\n\nAt the very least, I didn't pay full price (a whopping $10) for this. I might be a touch more upset in writing this if I did.\nBut it WAS the thing I was most looking forward to in the bundle, though...\n\nIn closing, I wish the devs the best in improving this...experience and will give future players some advice.\nDo not stop strafing, ever.

I can't abstain from admitting that the quality isn't great: it's dubstep, raw, crude, pumping and absolutely "videogame-like". The final product is an OST that is hardly playable outside of the game, but if you let it run on background as you play, if you can bare with it for a while without getting an headache, it becomes a fantastic soundtrack that only makes you more and more eager to keep playing this apparently mediocre videogame.\n\nParanautical Activity isn't for everyone, it's an hardcore game that will surely faze any casual gamer in matter of minutes: this game is unforgiving, it requires fast reflexes, great aim and ability to adapt to the new. The dozens of power-ups and the repetitive yet different level design can offer a new experience each and every new playthrough; on top of this, the player can choose up to six different characters, each with its own stats (such as health, speed, power, etc.).\n\nAs final note, the customisation in terms of graphic and sound options is minimal, however, it is possible to modify the FoV (Field of View) from 30 to 150.\nIf you need ratings:\n\nGraphic: 6/10\nSounds: 7/10\nGameplay: 8/10\nLongevity: 8/10\n\nOverall 7/10\n\nBuy this game if you're an hardcore FPS player who enjoys dungeon crawlers and/or arcade games.

I could mow down all mobs regardless of the distance with just the shotgun.\n\n3) The game still does not have multiplayer functionality.\nThe developer's blog did mention encountering problems on December of last year with creating the multiplayer function, but that was seven months ago.\n\n4) Despite randomized, the game has a very limited amount of mobs, rooms, bosses, and items.\nAs such, the game was not very engaging, as within twenty minutes, the player may have already encountered every single possible instance. Hence why I could not hold my attention onto the game for even 30 minutes.\n\nUntil the game performs a major update with multiplayer capability, and also have far more variety in its instances,\nI do not recommend purchasing this game.\n\nTL;DR:\nRanging from instance variety and mechanics, the game is too lacking in too many manners.\nUntil this game has a multiplayer function and an expanded library of instances, this game is not recommended.","July 17, 2014","false","0.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I can't say I totally disliked the game, but there are too many things that wouldn't allow me to raise my thumb for this game. Here's some:\n\n- The overall presentation and menus look very rushed and unpolished, even for an early access game.\n- The music, oh god, the music....\n- The total lack balance overall. Not only between classes, not only between enemies and you.\n- Dying feels often unfair and frustrating. I won't say how many thousands of times I've died in tons of other roguelikes, and yeah, there's a difference between dying by lack of skill and dying because the game is poorly balanced. The second option doesn't make a roguelike good, hard or anything, it makes it an unnecessary pain in the ♥♥♥ that any sane player should avoid.\n- No sense of progress at all. TBOI, Rogue legacy, etc.... they have a sense of achievement after each run. Doesn't happen in this game, and that's a no-go for me.\n\nSo, I hope you find this list useful, and I really hope the devs work really hard to make a great game, because there's potential.  I haven't been playing too much, so some things could be missing.\nAnyway, the game is on Humble Weekly sale for 1$, if you feel curious about it just go and get it, it won't hurt.","January 25, 2014","false","0.9"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Not the good "gah, I was so close" of other titles like Spelunky. But the "ugh, i died. Again." repetitve slog that makes playing this game seem like a chore, more than some recreational gaming\n\n\nWhen the enemies are not busy spamming endless projectiles at you, or just swarming you, their combat stratagy shows a decided lack of polish and sophistication...

It's essentially an 3D FPS Binding of Issac in gameplay sense.  Apparently they are in the works of adding a coop mode and achievements, so that will add some more fun to the game in the future. However, currently there is not much room for replayability other than beating the game mutliple times with different characters.  All characters are unlocked at the beginning, there are no item unlocks for doing certain things, no unlockable bosses, one final boss, and no story.

These rooms are filled with an increasingly difficult selection of enemies, along with a boss, a sub boss, a shop, and bonus rooms with various bonuses and challenges. Each floor is also a race against the clock to beat the the boss and progress before an unkillable phantom comes to hurry you along under threat of murder.\n\nThere are several playable characters, each with unique play styles. Some, such as Gorton, require precision but do crazy amounts of damage; and others, such as Dy-No-Mite, allow for a more loose play style at the cost of self-destructive splash damage. There is a selection of super weapons that range from a ninja sword that wrecks shop up close, a cannon that demolishes most things, and a gun that uses its ammunition to create more health, bombs, and armor.\n\nThere is a wide selection of items that can help you along (and more than a few that will make your going much tougher). Some can make you immune to explosions. Some can basically remove the cap on your rate of fire. Some can give you much more health at the cost of your speed. Some can make all floors dark. Some can do nothing other than change your character's injured sound to a selection of girlish "Ooches" and "Ouches."\n\nThe varied enemy design ranges from rocket-propelled turtles that fire missiles, glowing monkeys that jump back and forth between the floor and ceiling, and sharks that hunger for your feet. Bosses range from a pair of flying eyeballs that divide themselves when they die, a battleship with kamikaze planes circling it, and a nazi scientist that can resurrect the dead.\n\nThough the game doesn't officially release until around halloween, the final content patch just went live a few hours ago, so I feel comfortable finally officially recommending this game to anyone who enjoys the concepts behind it's design. If you like shooters, I recommend this game. If you like roguelikes, I definitely recommend this game. If you like games that marry the two concepts, then I can't imagine why you wouldn't love this game.","September 27, 2014","true","28.3"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/killsplode/recommended/250580/","killsplode","killsplode","http://steamcommunity.com/id/killsplode/","35 products in account","The enemys for this game are usually pretty easy and often involve just simply moving left or backwards to get away from most of their attacks but there are other enemys like the skull and the moth that you need to look out for and the skulls are pretty easy too but if you have low speed (and you often will) they can sneak up on you and deal massive damage. The moths are what you need to look out for because there shots home in on you and these shots WILL hit you and the WILL lower your health to zero eventually if you don't concentrate on dodging there shots these two enemys aren't that bad but they're the only really difficult enemys in this game.\n\nBosses are strange some bosses are easy and basically the only way to get hit by the easy ones is if you stop circle strafing around them.\n\nThe only bosses you need to look out for are the ones with homing shots because they fire a lot and if you aren’t glued to a wall and moving fast your dead for sure. The other hard bosses are the ones that melee you because those ones fly right at you and deal damage and if you aren't moving fast and jumping constantly your dead for sure. However if they aren't FLYING towards you and are just something like a skeleton or something they aren't a problem at all.\n\nSo bosses and enemys are alright just might need to change a few of their attacks to make the easy ones harder (recommended change) or the hard ones easier (not recommended change)  to stop making the easy boss fights feel like a circle strafing chore.\n\nNow lets look at the bad part. The items often horribly unbalanced and some items being flat out jokes that do almost nothing is AWFUL.\n\nThere is one item in this game called Doxxy that will put me off this game until it gets removed completely. The item changes the sound that you hear when you get hit. That’s. It. You went through an entire blue skull room boss fight where it was that moth with homing shots and you barely made it out alive? Well here’s this completely useless item! You saved up all your money to buy an item in the shop? Well this item is free! It's also useless and takes up 1 of 3 slots in the shop! You only get to items in the shop this time! Should have gotten lucky and had a random dice power up drop so you can reroll this item.\n\nThere are so many items that just plain suck. The one that flips gravity when you jump (makes the billion jump upgrades useless cuz you can't really jump anymore)\nDoxxy\nThe one that permanently lowers your speed for a couple of very temporary armor pieces (speed is essential if you aren't going fast then you WILL easily get your health gradually lowered to zero by moths and stuff. See above where I mention that speed is important to fight the bosses and enemys.).\nRage which is a damage up when you kill enemys! What could be wrong with that? Well, it's also a damage down. It is many damage downs. Every 10 seconds or so it lowers your damage by 0.083~ I think and when you kill enemys it increases damage by the same amount lowered so if you aren’t constantly instakilling enemys then you are losing damage. You can't insta kill with this item because its lowering your damage.\n\nNot to mention the item pickup tip for rage simply says "Damage up for killing enemys" and doesn't mention this damage down I'm glad I looked at the pdf file supplied that explains items. If I hadn't done that I would think this item was good!\n\nSame with Fool, an item of which simply says "doubles damage" on pickup and doesn't mention that enemys deal double damage too! I could imagine myself spending hours ingame with the fool item dying quickly and not realizing it was fool's fault. (Fool is a good item because of an item called kamikaze which turns those normally useless bombs your carrying into armor and deals damage to enemy that melee you. The downside to kamikaze is that it completely removes your health so if you don't have any bombs and you get hit you die. The whole idea behind kamikaze is that if you now spend health to shoot bombs but bombs require so many upgrades that you wouldn't be shooting them even if you didn't have kamikaze.\n\nI would often find myself getting kamikaze and running around with 40 bombs that I wont use because I have 40 health and it would take so long to get me to zero that the final boss is a cakewalk. I could even take fool to insta kill everyone and it would STILL take a long time to die. bombs are more plentiful then hearts as you can blow up explosive barrels get a 3 hp up at almost any time.\n\nThe other way of getting health is to take some health upgrades. The two I found were this one that doubles your health but lowers your speed. Because your speed is lower you are going to get hit easier and speed ups are so rare that this is never worth taking. The other just gives you two health and some armor which helps but both of these are nothing compared to kamikaze.\n\nI would say that kamikaze=win and if you don't get it you will have so many awful items thrown at your way that it's basically restart for kamikaze.\n\nI can name a lot more if I look at which item does in the little pdf file that says what every item does but that would be boring to see me explain why almost every item you find is bad.\n\nSo a few items are good and the majority are bad.\n\n\nThe point of item systems in roguelikes are that these items change gameplay and keep it interesting and a lot of these items have potential but are so imbalanced that they aren't worth taking and it turns the game into a restart early to get good items fest which is bad because this means that all your runs are the same because your taking the same items every time. This run is the same every time feeling is magnified by the low number of rooms the made for each floor. The number of rooms they made are so low that I found myself memorizing enemy spawn locations in only a few hours of playing.\n\nBecause of the sheer amount of bad items in this game the devs have a lot of stuff to fix. I heard that they are spending most of there time right now adding net co-op but I'd say if you wan't to fix this game then ditch the co-op idea for now and spend all your time on balancing these items and removing doxxy.\n\nI got this game on sale for 3 dollars and it's so bad because of the item system. I don't think this game is even worth 3 dollars as pressing the restart button over and over again isnt fun. If I wanted to press the same button over and over again I would just play cookie clicker.\n\nTL;DR \/\/\/\/\/\n\nPros\n+FOV slider goes from 30 to way to high\n+music is nice\n\nCons\n-enemys are easy except for one or 2\n-bosses are either easy or really hard and there's only 2 or 3 hard bosses.\n-The items are so bad that it encourages restarting\n-music is nice but it isn't tied to floors or rooms or anything it's litterally like they just took some youtube playlist and put it in the game. There is no boss fight music\n-I met the system requirements but expereinced harsh lag on lowest graphics because when you kill things the fall into a million cubes some times on later levels these squares become so plentiful that it becomes unbearable\n-game sounds are underwhelming. I looked at the credits and it had links to sites like freesounds which makes me feel like they just searched a shotgun sound . mp3 in google  and downloaded the first thing they saw\n-item pickup tips are helpful sometimes but other times don't mention a that an item has a secret bad effect. This encorages reading the pdf guide that comes with the game which means playing this game blind is a bad Idea\n-speed is essential for dodging and so many items lower this stat that most of the items become useless the game does have good movement but this good movement is gone if you take too many speed down items\n\nYes, the only good thing about this game is the fov slider and maybe one or two of the enemys.","October 25, 2015","false","8.0"," 13 of 25 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","13","25","0","0"

A wonderful game that takes some getting used to, but will definitely give you an adrenaline rush once you get the hang of it. 4.5/5.0.\n\nAs a side note, while this topic doesn't change my view on the game so far, it still needs to be addressed: The devs really need to get to work on this. Promising Co-op in "the next update" more than 6 months ago and still not releasing it yet isn't a good move if you want to keep your consumer base. Don't get me wrong, the game is still great; it is still an adrenaline rush to play, especially on the later levels, but the lack of love from the devs, from the promised bugfixes to the approaching vaporware status of Co-op, really hinders what this game could achieve.\n\nAll in all, if you're a fan of the twitch-action shooter, than PA is up your alley. If you're hestiant about buying the game though, I'd recommend waiting until the Co-op update is released before purchasing.","December 24, 2013","true","39.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

A wonderful game that takes some getting used to, but will definitely give you an adrenaline rush once you get the hang of it. 4.5/5.0.\n\nAs a side note, while this topic doesn't change my view on the game so far, it still needs to be addressed: The devs really need to get to work on this. Promising Co-op in "the next update" more than 6 months ago and still not releasing it yet isn't a good move if you want to keep your consumer base. Don't get me wrong, the game is still great; it is still an adrenaline rush to play, especially on the later levels, but the lack of love from the devs, from the promised bugfixes to the approaching vaporware status of Co-op, really hinders what this game could achieve.\n\nAll in all, if you're a fan of the twitch-action shooter, than PA is up your alley. If you're hestiant about buying the game though, I'd recommend waiting until the Co-op update is released before purchasing.","December 24, 2013","true","39.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

PA is extremely fast-paced, challenging, and sometimes terrifying. Like many other games of this type, you will find yourself fighting to clear rooms of enemies and eventually defeating the main boss. After the boss battle you will take an elevator to the next floor where the difficulty rises. From what I understand, you are on a Nazi ship with experimental creatures, and must fight your way to.. who knows where. The retro voxel graphics seem a bit overused these days, but it works fairly well. If you have had an urge to play this, I suggest picking it up to support development.

In essence, there's really no reason to brag about this game being procedurally generated, because all it really does is switch up the order in which you face the games small pool of monsters while throwing slightly different stats at you.\n\nPA also locks you into every room once you enter it, and won't let you out till you kill every monster inside.  This might have worked for Binding of Isaac since that game was essentially just an arena shooter pretending to be a roguelike, but here it just makes things more mindless. Unlike Doom and Quake where a large part of victory was not only reflexes but picking your battles, escaping at the right time, and thinking strategicly, PA instead reduces things to a guessing game by forcing you to blindly pick which room you enter and than not letting you leave if it turns out doing so might be the smarter strategy.\n\nThe controls feel a bit clunky also. I think you have to move for a bit before you accelerate, which feels like ♥♥♥♥ in a game where moving and turning fast could be the difference between life and death. The enemy designs are decent, but nothing special and are never put to much interesting use thanks to the arena based structure of the game.\n\nAestheticly it's of course as bleh as it looks. Same not-memorable chiptunes you've heard in a million retro indie games, same cuby graphics you've seen in a ton of Minecraft rip offs. I also have no idea why they thought it was a good idea to name their game a pun based on some dumb horror film people will have forgotten about in a few years.\n\nI think the point of all these action roguelikes is that people want a game that feels like a dungeon crawl but with enjoyable skill based combat and that feels new each time. The combat here may be be skill based, but it's rather bland and the games structure doesn't make it feel like a dungeon crawl at all, it also starts to feel repetitive even on the same playthrough. Doom and Quake did every aspect of this game better, and PA doesn't bring anything worthwhile to the table.","February 1, 2014","false","0.2"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","1"

It reads quite a bit like a short review: I finally got around to playing PA and I honestly don't recommend it. Even ignoring the asshattery from the guys who did it, it was much less than what I was hoping for. Objectively it's not all that great. There's a huge lack of sound effects from enemies and part of the fun is that pleasing "plonk" that you get when you hit /or kill something in an FPS. It's objectively not all that great of a roguelike either as one of the best things about roguelikes are generally the items and what you can do with them. There is also a sizeable shortage of floors which is again something that roguelikes generally excel at.\n\nI kind of sensed this too. Which is why I was very nervous about the work or lack thereof in the future after they said it was "finished". It really isn't by any decent project standards. Is sad too because I love the aesthetic.\n\nEdit: Played a bit of the atonement edition. Still crap. But I appreciate what they're trying to do and will hopefully improve it rather than merely republish it.","August 12, 2014","false","20.3"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

Even games that have little to anything to do with the traditions of the genre have introduced randomness as a mechanic in order to take advantage of the buzz the term now generations. However, as ubiquitous as roguelikes have become in the last few years on PC, there have been few to try it in an FPS, and fewer still that succeed when they try. Paranautical Activity was actually one of the first as it went through Early Access, but controversy stemming from the game’s original developer delayed its full release to just recently, when a new publisher bought the rights to the title. It’s a good thing too, because Paranautical Activity feels like Doom made in a different age, and certainly deserves recognition for setting the standard of what a procedurally generated shooter should be.\n\nWant to know more?

So this review is to reflect -current- gameplay and content.\n\nI have greatly enjoyed Paranautival Activity, and it has probably frustrated me about as much as Binding of Isaac has with regards to finding hard bosses, picking up bad items for my build, etc.\nIf you like games similar to Binding of Isaac or Tower of Guns, this one is a great middle ground. The weapons all have their own advantages (Personally, the sickle is the best weapon in the game hands down) and each item is useful in its own right and can add interesting or frustrating abilities. For example, one item gives you the same jumping mechanic as VVVVVV has, that is, switching gravity and standing on the ceiling instead of jumping. It's cool, but can be a huge pain sometimes.\n\nThe enemies are all interesting and difficult in their own right, and certain builds will find some enemies easier than others. I'd give the graphics, gameplay and amount of current content a good 8/10. I'm extremely excited about more stuff being released when the time comes, as I'm sure I'll come back to this game more.\nYou should give it a try, seriously!","September 17, 2014","true","10.9"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

With all those classes you would think that there would be some form of multiplayer, yet there isn't. Huge wish for it to be there.\n\nApart from that, the game plays great with the fast-paced shooting and the randomly generated levels make it just a bit more fun and give it a bit more replayability, however I don't see myself playing all that much up until the performance issue is sorted out or a multiplayer mode (One suggestion for that, have it so that you can play with random people, not just friends because I don't have any.) is made.","October 3, 2014","true","8.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I wanted to so badly.\n\nRoguelike?  FPS?  Cool voxel graphics and that 'simplistic but awesome' lighting system reminiscent of games like Quake?  Multiple classes to choose from?  It's just too good to be true, it seems... and sadly, that's the case.\n\nIt COULD have been good, could have easily been fixed and polished and balanced just a bit to create a fantastic experience, but in all the months and months I've had this game in its early access phase and even now after this 're-release', it's failed to address any of these issues.  In fact, all it seemingly HAS done is added a couple new enemies, achievements, and made shop prices even more impossibly high.  Great.\n\nThe main issue is that it's simply too difficult.  No, NOT "haha hardcore fun!" difficult like your Dark Souls or Binding of Isaacs out there, but cheap, excruciatingly painful and unforgivably frustratingly difficult.  From the beginning of the game most rooms are PACKED with unreasonable amounts of every variety of monster and there is little strategy beyond  moving around wildly and hoping dearly that you don't lose too much health (which is generally far too difficult to come by, besides) as you struggle to fight back.\n\nIf you're not lucky enough to be wildly powerful by the 3rd or 4th floors you're likely screwed, and by the 5th floor?  Forget about it.  I've never, ever been able to pass the 5th floor of this game in the tons of times I've attempted it, no matter how perfect my drops were, and this is coming from a guy who Platinum God'd the original Binding of Isaac and did all but the Lost achivements in the Rebirth version of that game.  I know FPS skills =/= overhead shooter skills, but I'd like to think my FPS ability is at least decent considering how many thousands of hours I've put into that genre over the last 15+ years and it proves I know how to weigh options, gauge danger, memorize enemy patterns and tackle various situations in action-roguelikes as a whole.. but no, I've never gotten past floor 5.  And I've only gotten TO it like three times ever, for that matter.\n\nThe problem is, by the time you get there, so many enemies are... well, they are very fast, charge you, and deal damage so fast that there is NOTHING you can do about it.  No matter how fast you kill, they're coming from all angles, many types, and with traps on top of that.  And if they get to you, one of these melee enemies, from the sharks near the beginning of the game to the skulls and imps later to the chainsaw boss that you're almost certainly screwed if you ever fight?  The damage is so rapid that it's going to be all over, no matter HOW much health you have.  The game sorely needs a 1-2 second invulnerability period between taking damage, especially with how low the health values are, how much damage you'll invariably take simply exploring the dungeons, and how few and far between health restoratives are.  But no, once you're in the jaws of one of these melee enemies it's ALL gone nearly instantly, even if you're a tank with 15+ health and 10+ shield which should be an incredibly beefy amount -- it'll all be gone in about 5 seconds and you most likely won't be able to kill them in time to escape it even with tons of damage boosting passives.\n\nAnd did I mention they (aside from the sharks) are FAST?  Like, so fast that you won't be able to outrun them without loads of speed passives.  And did I mention that these passives only drop from bosses and shops, most the boss passives are jokes and you won't be able to afford 90% of the good shop passives by the time you get that deep even if you clear out every single room in every level up till then?  And that you'll DOUBTLESSLY have to buy some of the lesser passives as you just barely scrounge up the money to do so if you even want a vague hope of REACHING that floor to begin with?  Yeah.\n\nSo there you have it.  An exercise in frustration in which you're going to be suffering through gauntlets of way too many enemies per room in such placements and combination that it's virtually impossible to avoid damage no matter how good you are, difficulty restoring the damage you took, and the knowledge that it's quickly going to become too overwhelming to even have any hope of moving forward no matter how good you are or how good the items you find are.  And no, it's not something you're going to learn and get better at despite the excrutiating difficulty like a GOOD action-roguelike; you're just going to suffer.

Maybe. (Note, this reflects an Early Acess game that will likely change over time, potentially negating this review. Dec 23, 2013).\nPA is best described as a rogue-lite FPS, where the gameplay mechanics are boiled down to the near most simple understandings of the FPS model. The goal is to reach lower floors, but I'm not sure if there is an end due to my constant dying. Nagivating each floor is much similar to the Binding of Issac and NES Zelda - Enter a rectangular room and clear the are of enemies before you can advance. The game controls near exactly like the original Painkiller and early entries in the Quake and Unreal Series - fast movement, circle strafing, and bunny hopping. The hook of PA is using your skill to stay alive with your limited health and advancing with a mix of your class weaponry, passive power-ups, and active power-ups.\n\nClasses include Crossbow user, Sickle thrower, Grenade Launcher, a Minigun user and a shotgun user (I forget the names of these classes, except Tank for the shotgun user). Each have their advantages and disadvantages in terms of weapon mechanics, secondary weapons (if any), damage output, range, and health. You can also get other weapons from gift shop if you are able to save up enough cash from them, which is often tough (Weapons seem to cost more than I have ever earned early in game, and when I do save up good funds, I'm usually on level 3-4 where I die). Enemies are varied, some which shoot a single a bullet or two every two seconds, some shooting a continuous hail of bullets, or even those that can nearly teleport to you for melee or enemies that can hop towards you and explode on proximity. What most shooting enemies have in common is that their projectiles aren't hit scan, so it takes timing, skill, and room knowledge to be sucessful. Each floor has a miniboss that usually provides a power-up, money, and sometimes health, weaponry, or items.\n\nThe art direction is much like 3D Dot Game Heroes with an interesting lighting selection - where there are very few lights but each projectile also emits projectiles. However, most players will simply say something like "DARK MINECRAFT VOXELS WITH GUNS". There is not much sound assets besides gun shots, door openings, item chimes, and the player's "Oof!" from being hit. Much of the sound is in the form of a nearly rave-like techno beats that reminds you of other "Futurisitcky" games like Wipeout, Extreme G, or Forsaken.\n\nI actaully personally enjoy the base mechanics and idea behind the game - it's actually very easy to get a grasp of circle bunny hopping and learning when is a good time to strafe or sometimes stand still. You can skip the majority or at least the remainder of the floor if you desire, provided that you are able to find the boss room quick enough. The game is both easy since I am decent at shooters and because circle strafing the whole room though the entirety of a fight is almost always sucessful, but hard due to limited health, and the unprediticable nature of roguelikes (random enemies, random power ups, random room types).\n\nMy main problem with this game is once you reach level 3 or 4, you often encounter enemy flying skulls which are often hard to dodge, can gang up on you and "combo air juggle" you against a wall, and what makes it worse is that they can get so close to you that are behind the point where your bullet will spawn, leaving you literally defenseless (unless maybe you have a melee weapon). This is compounded when you have a group of skulls that for me, seem impossible to deal with unless I'm in a room with a floor plan that will block them or at least slow them down a bit. And of course, like Rogue-lites/like (and Adult Swim games apparently) it needs to be punishingly hard, so despite me doing well up to this point, I die and have to start all over again. Since I'd like to clear my massive Steam backlog, "Ain't nobody got time fo' dat". But unlike other rogue-lites where it seems like patience, skill refinement and a bit of luck will help you beat the game, I hit this brick wall to completion once I meet these skulls and my enjoyment of this game is wiped away, much like my progress once I see that annoying Restart or Quit screen.\n\nParanautical Activity is very enjoyable, but a fairly shallow experience, which is multiplied by having to constantly restart. If you are into the resurgence of rouge-like style games as well as old schoold FPS games, there's a fun and simple game to be found here. But I fear the skulls will kill many player's enjoyment.","December 23, 2013","true","3.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The goal is to reach lower floors, but I'm not sure if there is an end due to my constant dying. Nagivating each floor is much similar to the Binding of Issac and NES Zelda - Enter a rectangular room and clear the are of enemies before you can advance. The game controls near exactly like the original Painkiller and early entries in the Quake and Unreal Series - fast movement, circle strafing, and bunny hopping. The hook of PA is using your skill to stay alive with your limited health and advancing with a mix of your class weaponry, passive power-ups, and active power-ups.\n\nClasses include Crossbow user, Sickle thrower, Grenade Launcher, a Minigun user and a shotgun user (I forget the names of these classes, except Tank for the shotgun user). Each have their advantages and disadvantages in terms of weapon mechanics, secondary weapons (if any), damage output, range, and health. You can also get other weapons from gift shop if you are able to save up enough cash from them, which is often tough (Weapons seem to cost more than I have ever earned early in game, and when I do save up good funds, I'm usually on level 3-4 where I die). Enemies are varied, some which shoot a single a bullet or two every two seconds, some shooting a continuous hail of bullets, or even those that can nearly teleport to you for melee or enemies that can hop towards you and explode on proximity. What most shooting enemies have in common is that their projectiles aren't hit scan, so it takes timing, skill, and room knowledge to be sucessful. Each floor has a miniboss that usually provides a power-up, money, and sometimes health, weaponry, or items.\n\nThe art direction is much like 3D Dot Game Heroes with an interesting lighting selection - where there are very few lights but each projectile also emits projectiles. However, most players will simply say something like "DARK MINECRAFT VOXELS WITH GUNS". There is not much sound assets besides gun shots, door openings, item chimes, and the player's "Oof!" from being hit. Much of the sound is in the form of a nearly rave-like techno beats that reminds you of other "Futurisitcky" games like Wipeout, Extreme G, or Forsaken.\n\nI actaully personally enjoy the base mechanics and idea behind the game - it's actually very easy to get a grasp of circle bunny hopping and learning when is a good time to strafe or sometimes stand still. You can skip the majority or at least the remainder of the floor if you desire, provided that you are able to find the boss room quick enough. The game is both easy since I am decent at shooters and because circle strafing the whole room though the entirety of a fight is almost always sucessful, but hard due to limited health, and the unprediticable nature of roguelikes (random enemies, random power ups, random room types).\n\nMy main problem with this game is once you reach level 3 or 4, you often encounter enemy flying skulls which are often hard to dodge, can gang up on you and "combo air juggle" you against a wall, and what makes it worse is that they can get so close to you that are behind the point where your bullet will spawn, leaving you literally defenseless (unless maybe you have a melee weapon). This is compounded when you have a group of skulls that for me, seem impossible to deal with unless I'm in a room with a floor plan that will block them or at least slow them down a bit. And of course, like Rogue-lites/like (and Adult Swim games apparently) it needs to be punishingly hard, so despite me doing well up to this point, I die and have to start all over again. Since I'd like to clear my massive Steam backlog, "Ain't nobody got time fo' dat". But unlike other rogue-lites where it seems like patience, skill refinement and a bit of luck will help you beat the game, I hit this brick wall to completion once I meet these skulls and my enjoyment of this game is wiped away, much like my progress once I see that annoying Restart or Quit screen.\n\nParanautical Activity is very enjoyable, but a fairly shallow experience, which is multiplied by having to constantly restart. If you are into the resurgence of rouge-like style games as well as old schoold FPS games, there's a fun and simple game to be found here. But I fear the skulls will kill many player's enjoyment.","December 23, 2013","true","3.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The deluxe atonement edition is definitely better, but the game still needs some tweaks, updates, and with some luck, even new items/weapons.

This is a FPS game where every room and every level indeed is randomly generated. We have some patterns like a boss room or a shop room every level although everything else is mostly random.\n\nIt's really hard to give a thumbs down to this game as it is technically a good game. This is just my personal opinion.\n\nPros:\n- it's quick\n- four distinct character classes - different starting weapons, hit points value, speed and so on\n- randomness - after every boss fight we get a random item that changes our stats\n- nice graphics, looks like Minecraft on steroids\n\nCons:\n- music is a dubstep mess - personally I don't like such kind of music although someone might find it amusing\n- this game is really hard. Maybe not Dark Souls level of hard but still hard\n- well character classes are distinct but only Tank starts with 9 hit points which relates to higher survival chance\n- I don't see a point in playing this game - this is only imo\n\nSo in conclusion - we have a technically decent game that lacks some kind of main motive. Or guts or spirit, whatever we may call it.\n\nIf you like randomly generated shooters then go for it, it's ok, it's hard as nails, it's quick as Quake 1 and so on.\n\nI personally cannot recommend this game as it lacks something vital.

MORE LIKE HYPBRID","http://steamcommunity.com/id/THE_BATPOOL/","136 products in account","SKIP TO THE BOTTOM FOR TL;DR/PROS AND CONS\n\nBefore we begin, I'd just lke to say that I'm fully aware of the drama surrounding this game, and I don't care. Drama doesn't affect the game at all. Now, you might say the fact that the developers lied about multiplayer is something worth noting, but I would say it's not. Don't buy games based on the imaginary multiplayer mode that's not even in the game, this is grade school logic. Alright, without further ado, lets jump into this one.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nSo if you buy a rougelike, you're buying it for the gameplay, and Paranautical Activity has a decent ammount of it. Sure, a lot of the rooms and enemies feel very samey, but it's got this addictive trait to it. You basically go room to room shooting various enemy's, whilst collecting items and weapons to bolster your arsenal and defeating bosses. However, this game has absolutely God awful balancing, as if it was barely playtested. At the end of the day, I had a ton of fun with this game, but all that fun will be gone in an instant because of some absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.\n\nTo start, there are certain classes that you cannot pick certain items up with. If you play as the Tank class, you CANNOT pick up ANY items that slow you down at all,  or you will be boned.  The enemies that just relentlessley follow you will be faster than you, and then you'll die, and there's no possible way to avoid this in certain rooms. In fact, for any class, any item that slows you down is a death trap. And some are comically underbalanced, "Nine Armor and you get a speed reduction" is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. So since you  can't pick up any items that make you go slower, you might think this means you should only pick up items that make you go faster, but you can't. I had one playthrough where I was going so fast, I litterally broke the game. Like legit, I was so fast time in game would stop, but this just means the froze. The game refused to get better FPS and stop freezing, until I died, which is some ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I don't understand how the devs would let this slip through, one of the first things you should do is to  test what happens when you get all the items in the game.\n\nAnother thing that's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, is what I think is the final boss, Dhalia. This might spoil some things for you if you're one of those people who want's to be blind to everything, but I don't care. She litterally spawns in two or three of other bosses every thirty seconds, effectively flooding the room with bosses. And after you kill her spawned in bosses, there are no drops  from them, meaning you can't undo any damage they did to you. And as if this wasn't bad enough, Dhalia has many more hit points than any boss before her ever has. I would beat the other bosses in about 30 seconds flat, but I barely chipped Dhalia's health in that time. You're probably thinking "Oh, look at this kid whine about how the game is too hard! Boo ♥♥♥♥in hoo!" but I'm not whining about how it's hard, I'm whining about how it's unfair. It's like the devs knew that the player would be OP as hell by this point, so they just said "♥♥♥♥ it, lets do all the bosses." so the difficulty goes from a 5 to an 11. It's rediculous.\n\n\n\nSTORY:\nI really have no clue on this one. You're on a boat, and there are demons and nazis for some reason??? I haven't beat the game yet, but nothing really follows the nautical theme. It's like the game wanted to be DOOM the rougelike, so it started doing that, then occasionally it remembers, "Oh ♥♥♥♥! I'm supposed to be nautical! Like sailors and such!" And then it'll throw in a sea themed boss.\n\nGRAPHICS:\nMeh. There's nothing to make them stand out, and it doesn't really feel artsy or like the game needed to be blocky. I mean I kind've like the style, but there are parts when the walls and floor will have high def looking textures that completely stand out from the blocky theme and it just kills it. I mean the models are all pretty good with the blocky style, but there's just not enough color to make everything pop, and even though it's cubes and such, it feels flat.\n\nSOUND:\nI don't know how to judge dubstep because I don't listen to it, but the sound isn't nautically themed that's for damn sure. I try to push it to the back of my mind, but there's maybe 5 soundtracks at max, so they just wind up being grating and annoying as hell.\n\n\nPROS:\n-Fun gameplay\n-Kind've like Doom\n-Decent boss variety\n-More or less unique\n\nCONS\n-Very unbalanced\n-Feels like no playtesting was done\n-Grating music\n-Almost no sense of game juice\n-Doom wannabe\n\n\n[D-]  -  If you really want this game, buy it on sale. About 5.00$ is a fair price, it's a good time waster, not much else.\n","June 4","false","29.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Paranautical is a rouge-like first person shooter, think Binding of Issac, mixed with Bioshock, which is a beautiful idea, and the 3D pixelated graphics give it a lot of charm, but that's about where charm ends, being a first person shooter, Paranautical Activity is very unforgiving, to put it in perspective I have beat The Binding of Issac multiple times, with multiple charcters, but with Paranautical Activity I'm lucky if I can make it passed the first floor. A lot of the trobule is you are constantly surrounded by enemies, which normally is'nt so bad, but like most FPS when you take damage there is usually a damage indicator, so you know which direction to turn and shoot, not with Paranautical Activity, so you figure that you'll use explosives to handle everything, well that's where another game breaking flaw shows it's ugly head, when you kill an enemy it burst into red pixels that skatter onto the floor and stay there for a few seconds, not bad right? Well every explosion also has a particle effect to the same degree, just orange pixels, so if you kill a group of enemies with an explosion you're in for a lot of particles, and unfourtately the game can't take all the pixels on screen, so it starts to lag real bad, and I know it's not my computer, because I can run games like Skyrim, and Dark Souls with no problems. So there is a lot of good in this game, it's got a great idea, all it needs to do is fix some bugs, but it seems like the developers don't want to fix anything, and until they do, or until they lower the price, I can't reccomend this game, however, if you can find the game for cheap, and you wanna kill a hour or two, pick it up.","September 12, 2014","false","0.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There is a great concept buried under piles of poor execution and broken promises. The developers also take out anger on the buyers by angrily typing about how our expectations are too high, and how they couldn't possibly finish in time for the deadlines they set for themselves. They also publicly stated that the game was being abandoned. Many promised features aren't going to be included, and they will be putting a 1.0 label on the game.\n\nThe game itself is repetitive, glitchy, unbalanced and unpolished.

Also most of the "Abilities" you can get have no explanation and don't seem to affect anything upon use.  There's not even a stat menu to see if any of the power ups have changed them.\n\nAnd did I mention how easy it is to die?  Most of the beginning weapons barely have any effect on the enemies sometimes and it's almost like you lose health way too fast in some encounters.  You can survive for a much longer time in the Binding of Isaac compared to this game.  Not only that, but everytime you die it doesn't even feel like you've accomplished anything.  I know the point of a Rogue-Like is that you only have one life to do everything, but this game takes that aspect way too seriously that it feels pointless to even try.\n\nAs for the storyline... well... WHAT STORYLINE?\n\nI don't know who I am, where I'm going, or what I'm even doing this for.  There's really no point in doing whatever "Mission" I'm trying to do if there's no real goal in mind.  I'd say to get this game if it had a great storyline despite the weird and often annoying gameply, but since it doesn't even have THAT then I don't recommend that anyone really get this.\n\nThe only redeeming feature are the graphics, and while I admire that, it takes a bit more than fancy creatures and pixel guns to make a game work.\n\n3/10 Would only play again since I paid for it","May 1, 2015","false","0.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's the same bomb-tossing boss-fighting projectile-dodging roguelite system that made BoI so much fun. Being in 3D, however, means that you've got one more axis with which to dodge projectiles, and that makes the game too easy. Most bosses and rooms can be cleared by bunny-hopping around your enemies in circles and firing.\n\nWere this a finished game, I would not recommend it.

The guns have a nice sound to them making them feel quite real\n~Replayability: I can see stacking up voer a hundred hours in this game before I grow bored of it and that's if the game doesn't get more content through updates. With the updates I forsee 300+ hours.\n~Graphics: Greatly stylised old-school look, taking in the old pixelated guns and making it the style to make this game quite beautiful and always pleasing to look it. The dark theme keeps everything intense in feel and makes sure your eyes focus on what is moving.\n\nAll in all: Despite my love for a great story and this game lacking an obvious one, I don't typically expect one out of shooters or most games I buy to lose a few minutes here and there. Adding that to the rest of the game simply being this addictive I can't say much more than it is a must try, the game is lots of fun and can even startle you at times and despite some of the enemies feeling a tiny bit cheap I associate that to my innability at aiming than the enemy itself being cheap.\n\nI do recommend!","February 6, 2014","true","8.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The music playing in the background is very fastpaced, as it is techno,  making the gameplay very fastpaced. This game plays as a run-and-gun, where you go into separate rooms and they will start to branch off from there. The doors lock until you kill all of the enemies, so you cannot flee.There are normal rooms, boss rooms, and gift shops, where you use the gold you earned from the enemies you killed. There are also a few classes to be chosen from, but since this is an alpha, there are not many. For an alpha, this is a great game (in my opinion).

A game that claims to mix the gameplay of Doom and Quake with the roguelike aspects of games like The Binding of Isaac? There's gotta be some major patchwork to be done in this game. And it's true, there DOES need to be additional content to be added. Right now, at the time of writing this (January 2014), this game is very much still a barebones basic game (and I'm not talking graphically).\n\nThe gameplay is very satisfying. The level design is random each and every time, so it's got one part of its description on the store page right. It IS like The Binding of Isaac in that way. The randomly generated levels and mix of enemies gives one a feeling of helplessness and unaware of what will come next. Bosses are fairly tough, and defeating one, depending on which character you play, is actually quite rewarding. For example, fighting a boss as Gilead is very different than fighting that same boss as The Tank.\n\nThe character stats, however, are not very balanced. At least all the characters have similar stats, and there's no real pros and cons to choosing one over the other. Out of the ten times I played, I chose Gilead 7 times and The Tank 3 times. Now, while this doesn't exactly seem like a good sample size, you can just look up the character stats online. All of them are fairly even and not balanced at all. I suspect this will get fixed in future patches and updates, and I do hope it does, because if these are actually the final character stats, I can't see myself playing this game much longer.\n\nBack to the gameplay, the FPS integration is absolutely wonderful. A slightly minimalist HUD, simple weapons, great gunplay. These are the cores of any FPS game in my opinion if you want a good mix of immersion and good gameplay. There's nothing really much to say on the guns and the FPS aspects themselves other than I AM very much reminded of Quake and Doom in the level design, specifically with the wide open spaces you often encounter in the many rooms you'll be running and gunning through.\n\nOverall, I give Paranautical Activity a 7.5/10. For an Early Access game, it's actually pretty well done. The level design, gameplay, and integration of two vastly different genres are definitely what I found to be unique about the game. However, as with most Early Access games, be wary: developers can just stop updating at any time they please.

If so, please recommend me one, because thus far no other game has pulled it off other than Paranautical Activity, that I know of.\n\nThis game is spectacular, in my eyes. It's not just because of the shiney voxels, The Binding of Isaac-inspired randomly-generated rooms, the way I gasp in joy as I receive a pile of gold from a slain enemy, the wobbles and wabbles of the dubstep soundtrack, or the fact that there's a David Bowie class -- no, I'm being serious.\n\nDespite being denied the previlage to be put on Steam because of the whole adultswim business, Parantautical Activity proudly pulls off what you would call a Binding of Isaac FPS, if you just add lots of shiney lights, weird but freakishly cool creatures, dubstep and voxel-based graphics.\n\nDefinitely try this game out, it's truly an experience, indeed.","February 1, 2014","true","2.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's the same bomb-tossing boss-fighting projectile-dodging roguelite system that made BoI so much fun. Being in 3D, however, means that you've got one more axis with which to dodge projectiles, and that makes the game too easy. Most bosses and rooms can be cleared by bunny-hopping around your enemies in circles and firing.\n\nWere this a finished game, I would not recommend it. It's fun for only a short while in its current state. Because I'm anticipating more content and more refined mechanics, I'll let it slide as a loose recommendation.","January 24, 2014","true","0.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The guns have a nice sound to them making them feel quite real\n~Replayability: I can see stacking up voer a hundred hours in this game before I grow bored of it and that's if the game doesn't get more content through updates. With the updates I forsee 300+ hours.\n~Graphics: Greatly stylised old-school look, taking in the old pixelated guns and making it the style to make this game quite beautiful and always pleasing to look it. The dark theme keeps everything intense in feel and makes sure your eyes focus on what is moving.\n\nAll in all: Despite my love for a great story and this game lacking an obvious one, I don't typically expect one out of shooters or most games I buy to lose a few minutes here and there. Adding that to the rest of the game simply being this addictive I can't say much more than it is a must try, the game is lots of fun and can even startle you at times and despite some of the enemies feeling a tiny bit cheap I associate that to my innability at aiming than the enemy itself being cheap.\n\nI do recommend!","February 6, 2014","true","8.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The music playing in the background is very fastpaced, as it is techno,  making the gameplay very fastpaced. This game plays as a run-and-gun, where you go into separate rooms and they will start to branch off from there. The doors lock until you kill all of the enemies, so you cannot flee.There are normal rooms, boss rooms, and gift shops, where you use the gold you earned from the enemies you killed. There are also a few classes to be chosen from, but since this is an alpha, there are not many. For an alpha, this is a great game (in my opinion).

For example;\n\nThe "Eye of Dubbbz" item. I got to stage 7 and picked this up. It made all of the rooms completely pitch-black (until the end of the game). I literally just quit. Why is that even in the game? That's a stupid idea for an item, especially when rooms become more cluttered with obstacles so you run into walls like the Kool-Aid man and die\n\n+ Skill-based gameplay which is fun\n+ Movement is spot-on\n+ Music is AMAZING (Produced by MACAskill)\n+ Weapons are fun for the most part and each have their different gimmick\n+ Punny names for weapons and items which is cool\n\n- Classes are basic and just have different health & armour, weapon, and speed.\n- Nazi levels seem out of place\n- Bad items that are there just to be bad and ruin your experience\n- Gameplay isn't addicting like other rougelikes\n- Exploding enemies can spawn in front of you as the enter the room\n\nParanautical Activity is mostly a game about movement, and I love how a lot of the items such as the Recoil Rifle allow for some top tier gameplay, To make the classes more unique I think each class should start with a specific movement item (Such as dash, double jump, small etc)\n\nThe aesthetic of this game is also confusing... it's like a nazi, pirate, demon shooter? What?\n\nTLDR: It's a fun game, but I recommend you get this game on the cheapest sale and give the rest of the money to MACAskill (the music producer), as they shafted him out of payment and basically took his music.\n\n\n","January 3","true","8.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This has to be the most toughest and yet addicting games I have ever played in a while.\n\nYou start out with a selection of people to play as and then off you go, no explaining, no story, just go out there, kick some @$$ and DON'T DIE. The monsters are weird as hell even as voxels, and the Bosses are a BIT.CH to kill, but once you kill them, gives you that really good feeling that you kicked that boss real good in the @$$... But it gets worst from there. More and more of those bloody bast*rds get more crazy, more strong and what not. When you die, you don't want to quit, you just want to keep playing to get to a higher level than last time you died. The use of RPG elements is actually workable as well. Gives you a bit of those other games with RPG Elements like Saints Row 4, Wolfenstien, Bulletstorm and so on.\n\nMusic is amazing, mostly the song that plays in the trailer. When I heard that, it made me scream "DIE DIE DIE YOU F***ING BLOODY BAST*RDS!!!" with a side of Dubstep with that.\n\nQuality of the game is like that of Minecraft meets Doom, it just sounds awesome even saying that... well when I think of it.\n\nSo overall, it's a blood bath orgy of fun.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PurpleXVI/recommended/250580/","PurpleXVI","PurpleXVI","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PurpleXVI/","535 products in account","This game fails on pretty much every level.\n\nFirstly, the concept: It's basically a bullet-hell game in-first person, giving you an incredibly poor idea of where you are in relation to all the projectiles that are incoming from every angle and making it distressingly common that you sidestrafe into an obstacle, get stuck and eat a face full of projectile salvo.\n\nSecondly, the graphical/UI design: Pretty much everything that isn't a projectile is the same colour of shadowy gray-ish mess, meaning that about the only way to spot enemies is their glowing eyes(when they have them), which are obscured by the helpful volleys of glowing projectiles all over the damn place.\n\nThirdly, it's a high-paced, dodging-heavy shooter... in a game where every single area is a cramped cube often further obstructed by stairs and similar. This one should speak for itself.\n\nAnd then there are just all the gameplay issues. For instance, on the third level I encounter a melee-attacking boss who moves so fast that even at constant sprint away from him, even bunny-hopping, he constantly catches up with me and hits me. There's literally no way to avoid damage, hitting him doesn't slow him down, Nothing does. Your only hope of beating him is that your damage output and soaking ability beats his, which is entirely down to what pickups you've been lucky enough to get.\n\nDid anyone ever playtest this? Or did they just slap a bunch of things together and go: "FAST-PACED MUSIC. PIXEL ARTSTYLE. IT'S A WINNER."?\n\nThe music's pretty nice, though, so there is that.\n\n(Also why would you saddle one of the playable options with a melee weapon when every single enemy is either charging towards you to make its own melee attacks or constantly vomiting bullets? It's impossible to use it without taking damage.)","March 26, 2015","false","0.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Having a speedy, arcade-style shooter in a day and age where slow and steady is the way to go is always a welcome sight. The controls are confusing at first, given that the only way to learn them is through the launcher's configuration menu, but once you've got them down the game leaves you to your own designs. The rooms themselves are simple, having stairs, pits, tunnels, exploding barrels, and/or lava, but the types of enemies and number of them are just right to give the player a balance of control and chaos, while staying fresh each time around. There's also a lineup of high-octane Drum and Bass songs to run while you play, although they're knd of grating, and sometimes you get a few seconds of silence while the tracks are switching.\n\nWhile the combat in Paranautical Activity is great, the loadouts you get are rather disappointing. You choose package that includes a primary weapon with infinite ammo, a secondary weapon with limited ammo, and a number of stats including health, speed, and damage, although the concept of loadouts like this isn't exactly a nice one. There are no RPG elements either, aside from the various buffs and weapons you find in the game proper, so permadeath sets you back at square one. This isn't a big problem, but it really limits the replay value once you hit the difficulty curve.\n\nAnd from here inlies the biggest problem with Paranautical Activity: it feels very lean. Almost unfinished. There isn't much in the way of sound design, and despite the gorgeous visual style, particle system, and lighting, the game suffers from a lot of emptiness, even for a roguelike. After about an hour and a number of deaths, you feel like you've seen everything this game has to offer. Games like Binding of Issac have a plot and a sense of humor to keep you hooked. Games like Rogue Legacy have broad RPG elements and randomized perks to keep you hooked. This game doesn't really have anything. Even unlockable weapons would be welcome.\n\nParanautical Activity is a good game with moments of real fun, and it scratches an itch that modern FPS games outright refuse to scratch. I want more out of this game, but it wears out on you about an hour in. If you and your wallet can justify an hour's worth of  gameplay that's fun and unique, then by all means pick up this game. It's an exercise in genre hybridization, but also in missed potential.","May 11, 2014","true","2.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

There's also a lineup of high-octane Drum and Bass songs to run while you play, although they're knd of grating, and sometimes you get a few seconds of silence while the tracks are switching.\n\nWhile the combat in Paranautical Activity is great, the loadouts you get are rather disappointing. You choose package that includes a primary weapon with infinite ammo, a secondary weapon with limited ammo, and a number of stats including health, speed, and damage, although the concept of loadouts like this isn't exactly a nice one. There are no RPG elements either, aside from the various buffs and weapons you find in the game proper, so permadeath sets you back at square one. This isn't a big problem, but it really limits the replay value once you hit the difficulty curve.\n\nAnd from here inlies the biggest problem with Paranautical Activity: it feels very lean. Almost unfinished. There isn't much in the way of sound design, and despite the gorgeous visual style, particle system, and lighting, the game suffers from a lot of emptiness, even for a roguelike. After about an hour and a number of deaths, you feel like you've seen everything this game has to offer. Games like Binding of Issac have a plot and a sense of humor to keep you hooked. Games like Rogue Legacy have broad RPG elements and randomized perks to keep you hooked. This game doesn't really have anything. Even unlockable weapons would be welcome.\n\nParanautical Activity is a good game with moments of real fun, and it scratches an itch that modern FPS games outright refuse to scratch. I want more out of this game, but it wears out on you about an hour in. If you and your wallet can justify an hour's worth of  gameplay that's fun and unique, then by all means pick up this game. It's an exercise in genre hybridization, but also in missed potential.","May 11, 2014","true","2.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I felt the game was clunky and the randomly generated map/rooms didn't seem to mix anything up. This game is a roguelike shooter, meaning that you enter a room, shoot everything that moves, collect coins and move to the next room. You use coins to buy new gear from shops, was it bombs, upgrades or weapons. I hate that the description of this game boasts with big names like Doom (this game lacks the atmosphere), Quake (you run fast, is it enough?), Binding of Isaac (because there are separate rooms, really?) and Spelunky (wait, what?). Paranautical Activity is similar to Serious Sam as you enter an area and kill everything in it, then repeat. It's roguelike in a way that if you die you start from the beginning. And as I started ranting I must warn everyone that these minecraftian graphics may cause headache because of the fast twitchlike movement. Did it for me.\n\nEdit: Nothing changed in the full release.

Mainly bought it for the advertised co-op, but the dev decided to cancel that. And the recent update forced a "Ghost" on the player, where it spawns if you take too long, forcing the player to speed run rather than plan ahead. If the Ghost get's altered to where it's optional or get's moved to some sort of Speed-run/Hardcore mode, I'll remove that complaint, but the advertised co-op canceled is a big slap on the face,\n\nI personally wouldn't recommend it out of principle, but in the interest of fairness, this is a nice fast paced action game with permadeath, though the Ghost is annoying.\n\nEdit 1: In a post on the forum, the dev claims he will be putting out patch that will make the Ghost only appear after you beat the game once, THEN it's forced on you with no other option than to delete your save(and cloud), to start over. It's not like there's some sort of progression system, but it's an annoying hurdle. Dev said that new players hate it, but 'veterans' love it, which I think is big assumption  thinking that only vets love it and noobs hate it. Whatever, this post will be updated when he updates and I'll add on details on his choice.\n\nOh, and by 'no progression system', I meant progression that carries over between games. There's plenty of power-ups that make you stronger or have more health, speed, etc.\n\nEdit 2: Firstly, I was wrong about the progression system. There's an 'unlocks' menu that shows a bunch of things you can do and it'll unlock various things like weapons, characters, powerups, items, new starting/findable items for specific characters, and game modes. I think it's a very nice system.\n\nFor the Ghost part: There are 3 game modes. Classic has no Ghost and you can't reach the 8th floor. Hardcore mode has both the 8th floor and the Ghost. And Infinite mode, which is basically Hardcore mode, but when you complete the 8th floor, you loop back to the first. Not sure of all the details for Infinite mode, but thats the basic gist of it.\n\nEdit 3: Your 'thumbs down' arouse me, keep them coming.","October 9, 2014","false","3.1"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

The bullet-hell is way too difficult to be fun for anyone less than a pro FPS player.\n\nAlso, I they might think they're being cool by not telling you what the items do, and experimenting to see what is what would normally be okay with me, but it is totally unfeasible when you can almost NEVER get enough money to buy items, making experimenting really slow and unrewarding.  That, on top of the fact that most items have nearly un-observable passive effects that make figuring them our nigh-on impossible.  Couple that with the "usable" items and "super weapons" being unable to use until you go to Google to figure out which key does what, because you're given NO INSTRUCTION OF ANY KIND EVER.\n\nI understand learning by experimentation, and games not taking you by the hand, but it has to be fun and worthwhile, like a Binding of Isaac or Dark Souls.  This game is simply not fun enough, rewarding enough, or well enough explained or made to be worth it.\n\nWe'll see what happens when it's finished, but unless you have twitch reflexes, and absolute precision I would avoid this game if I were you.","May 16, 2014","false","9.4"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","3","0","0"

All enemies either run at you or start shooting slow projectiles. Kill them all. Repeat.\n\nOne key difference is that the enemies are dead silent, rather dimly lit, and deal a lot of damage. When you walk into a new room, you can easily run backwards into a 12 foot high Satan and lose three hearts in an instant. You would think that this would make the game unplayable, but the number of different room layouts is so small that you will start remembering enemy spawn locations after a couple games.\n\nSince the game is rogue-like, it is really tempting to play round after round in order to see new items. However, few items really change how the game is played. You are going to be running backward holding down your left mouse button a lot.\n\nI only got as far as the floor where swastikas start appearing on walls and tiny fast moving raptors run at you (6th? 8th? I don't remember). That is when I realized I would have to memorize a whole new area of layouts, and that I had stopped having fun four hours ago.\n\nCould it appeal to some people? Maybe.

Is it a fun game? I'd say so. It's fast paced, action-packed and the graphics are surprisingly unique. However, there's just too much I personally don't enjoy for me to keep playing. I'm all for hard games, but in some parts, the difficulty spikes in unfair ways. I'm not even talking about the bosses, which, while cliche (flying skulls? really?), are fun and pleasantly challenging. I'm referring to enemies like the land sharks that are nearly impossible to hit and can grind your health away in seconds after noiselessly charging you in packs of 5 or 6. Another issue I had was the item system. Some items, when activated, seem to do absolutely nothing. I'm sure they were performing some function, but some feedback or even a short bio displayed when picking up the item would have been appreciated. Also why does the sword use ammo? That's nitpicking, I'll admit, but something just seems odd about that to me, especially since it appears to be just a standard medieval sword. While fun, Paranautical Activity doesn't really enough to keep me playing for more than half an hour or so.\n\nScore: 5/10","February 24, 2015","false","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The tank is slow so he can't avoid as well and thats whats meant to happen. You can't complain about getting screwed over for your choice.

Even though this is an alpha/beta build with a good number of glitches.  I had a good time with the 6 hours I played it.\n\nThe basic idea is that each level is sort of square built like Zelda on Nintendo (or more recently Binding of Isaac) where you get randomly generated levels, collect power ups, fight random bosses, and move to the next floor.  The twist is that it is a first person shooter with a lot of water based monsters/weapon/power up ideas.\n\nIn its current state it is fun, but flawed as the monster curve through the levels generally out paces your power ups.  Most games end not through skill but an unfair situaiton, but I imagine those will be worked out over time.\n\nAnyone who played it during this alpha/beta phase knows that if you have a grenade launcher/no speed upgrades and you fight the chainsaw boss... just restart because your dead anyways.\n\nThe power ups were fun and creative - at times I felt like I was playing a strange Quake Mod and other times it just funny.  The music is also energetic.\n\nA pretty cool game for the price - as of 1/14/2014 - I will revisit once the game has been fully updated and complete.","January 14, 2014","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's like they took a good control scheme and deliberatly made it worse. Your character controls awful, and while normally the retro atmosphere would be enough to do it for me this game feels... clunky, I guess?\n\nThe boss fights are terrific, but the lack of variety is the real killer for me. I guess the plan was to try and let the randomly generated content make for lots of replayability, but the game is to short to get any unique experiences. The roguelike mechanic just ends up feeling like a padding technique in the end. Nice idea, but poorly executed.\n\nThen there's the elephant in the room - The Public Relations.\n\nThese guys are terrible at PR. There have been allegations of censorship, insilts made to the gaming comunity, and several instances of trolls provoking negative responses. It's my personal belief that this is the reason this game was "finished" early - It's not a case of the goals of the developer being met, it's that they just want it to be done with.\n\nI would suggest picking up the games it was inspired from - you'll get a lot more gameplay, for substantially less cost.","May 31, 2014","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At first glance, you hear and see it as a horror shooter game, but when you see someone play it, or play it for yourself, you realize it is everything but that.\n\nParanautical Activity (you have no idea how hard that is to type) is a blocky, retro type fps shooter. This particular game is not meant to be played for hours at a time, in my opinion. Because you can die so quickly and easily, I havent played it for more than 15 minutes at a time.\n\nOf course, Paranautical Activity has a lot of work that must be done to stand up to games such as Doom, Shadow Warrior, etc. I do personally think this game can stand up to and potentially overthrow the games mentioned before in Retro shooters.\n\nNow, about the game.\n\nThis game has every element of a good shooter, but these elements need to be executed better. Don't get me wrong, I love this game. I play it whenever I'm bored, and it is a very good time waster (I say that in the best way possible). You are dropped down into a series of rooms by a red elevator. If you enter a room, the doors will shut and you can't leave until you kill all the enemies. Every once in a while, you'll come across a boss room. The boss's health will be displayed on the top of the screen and when you kill it, the doors open again as if you're in a normal room. Occasionally, you will stumble upon a shop. These shops are randomized with useful/useless items that you can pick up and use in battle rooms. If you buy an item, it disappears from the pedastle.\n\nOverall, I like the game. It's in early access, so the kinks and bugs I meantioned earlier will most likely be fixed. It's on sale a lot, and it's even worth the $10 it's usually priced at.\n\n9/10, buy it.","December 28, 2013","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When you destroy enemies and explosive barrel's you will see a lot of 'particle' like effects which look great.\n\nIn its current state I would give this game a 6/10, I have not read about the upcoming features but this could easily be a 7 or 8/10 game when it is completed.","December 11, 2013","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has a terrific soundtrack, retro/modern graphics combinedwith the rpg elements of choosing a character. The difficulty increases each time you move up a lvel in the elevator, which is good. Some of the enemies look like something out of doom, but then you have these random Jawas shooting fireballs at you and exploding dinosaurs. The bosses are even better, some so strange that you'll wonder where the inspiration for them came from. Another ineresting element to the game is the money system, in which you collect coins to buy various upgrades that can alter your speed, health and jumping abaility among other things. This game is great as it stands, but if you get it, somewhere along the lin co-op will be introduced, might be a long shot, but would only make it more fun.","April 23, 2014","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's like they took a good control scheme and deliberatly made it worse. Your character controls awful, and while normally the retro atmosphere would be enough to do it for me this game feels... clunky, I guess?\n\nThe boss fights are terrific, but the lack of variety is the real killer for me. I guess the plan was to try and let the randomly generated content make for lots of replayability, but the game is to short to get any unique experiences. The roguelike mechanic just ends up feeling like a padding technique in the end. Nice idea, but poorly executed.\n\nThen there's the elephant in the room - The Public Relations.\n\nThese guys are terrible at PR. There have been allegations of censorship, insilts made to the gaming comunity, and several instances of trolls provoking negative responses. It's my personal belief that this is the reason this game was "finished" early - It's not a case of the goals of the developer being met, it's that they just want it to be done with.\n\nI would suggest picking up the games it was inspired from - you'll get a lot more gameplay, for substantially less cost.","May 31, 2014","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At first glance, you hear and see it as a horror shooter game, but when you see someone play it, or play it for yourself, you realize it is everything but that.\n\nParanautical Activity (you have no idea how hard that is to type) is a blocky, retro type fps shooter. This particular game is not meant to be played for hours at a time, in my opinion. Because you can die so quickly and easily, I havent played it for more than 15 minutes at a time.\n\nOf course, Paranautical Activity has a lot of work that must be done to stand up to games such as Doom, Shadow Warrior, etc. I do personally think this game can stand up to and potentially overthrow the games mentioned before in Retro shooters.\n\nNow, about the game.\n\nThis game has every element of a good shooter, but these elements need to be executed better. Don't get me wrong, I love this game. I play it whenever I'm bored, and it is a very good time waster (I say that in the best way possible). You are dropped down into a series of rooms by a red elevator. If you enter a room, the doors will shut and you can't leave until you kill all the enemies. Every once in a while, you'll come across a boss room. The boss's health will be displayed on the top of the screen and when you kill it, the doors open again as if you're in a normal room. Occasionally, you will stumble upon a shop. These shops are randomized with useful/useless items that you can pick up and use in battle rooms. If you buy an item, it disappears from the pedastle.\n\nOverall, I like the game. It's in early access, so the kinks and bugs I meantioned earlier will most likely be fixed. It's on sale a lot, and it's even worth the $10 it's usually priced at.\n\n9/10, buy it.","December 28, 2013","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Is it a fun game? I'd say so. It's fast paced, action-packed and the graphics are surprisingly unique. However, there's just too much I personally don't enjoy for me to keep playing. I'm all for hard games, but in some parts, the difficulty spikes in unfair ways. I'm not even talking about the bosses, which, while cliche (flying skulls? really?), are fun and pleasantly challenging. I'm referring to enemies like the land sharks that are nearly impossible to hit and can grind your health away in seconds after noiselessly charging you in packs of 5 or 6. Another issue I had was the item system. Some items, when activated, seem to do absolutely nothing. I'm sure they were performing some function, but some feedback or even a short bio displayed when picking up the item would have been appreciated. Also why does the sword use ammo?

Trying to use any of the 4 main weapons to fight most of the enemies is a real challenge.\n- Classes are pretty useless. They all seem to be extremes with only 1 balanced class. Other classes include, guy with 1 hp, guy who moves slower than a rock, guy with ultra useless weapon.\n- Extremely repetitive locations. Every room is the same as the last and it's the same shade of blue most of the game.\n- Floaty controls, the movement just feels wrong. View bobbing is annoying too.\n- Colliding with oddly placed staircases and other pointless structures.\n\nOverall:\nI don't recommend this game. Each play session is so damn short it's ridiculous. No matter how many times i try and with any of the classes, I rarely make it to the 3rd floor. Often getting hit by things I can't even see or are unable to dodge with the slower classes. It lacks content, isn't very fun and gets very repetitive very quickly. Unless you like shooting the same enemies in the same rooms with the same 4 textures using awful weapons, stay away from this game. There are many better shooters out there. The roguelike elements aren't used in any interesting way here either. Just another excuse to stretch out a game's length when it otherwise lacks content and substance.","June 9, 2015","false","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not nearly as replayable as other roguelikes, maybe 20 hours at most. it's very repetetive, which is something I personally am okay with, but many people aren't. The power ups aren't interesting, the gameplay is pretty good, even if it's just strafing in a circle for every boss or room, dodging is annoying especially with homing shots. for homing shots, the only way to dodge it is cling against the wall so the bullet flies into the wall. There are some things in the game that make it very laggy, making me rush to kill the boss before it lags too hard ( talking about the snail boss ). it's not well optimized for sure. But it's fun to play in my opinion! Like, it's almost literally binding of Isaac in FPS form! If you are fine with all these cons, then this game should be plenty fun for you!","March 17","false","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A rogue-like FPS could have been really intuative, yet the controls feel clumsy and the difficulty feels to brash.\nIt tries to play on an "Items to make it easier" system like Binding of Issac yet going room to room is unpredictable and ends up biting you in the ♥♥♥. Sure Binding of Issac can screw you over if you explore but that's usually in later levels, Paranautical Activity does this on the first level!\nAs I said the controls feel clunky (At least it does on my 360 controller) and the game tries to be too fast paced for it's on good. Doom was great as a fast paced game, but yet Doom didn't have unpassable rooms because you didn't defeat all the monsters (not all the time at least from my memory.) There is a sprint button, yet it completely ♥♥♥♥s with your aim. Doom also had a sprint command but in Doom you can't look up or down and your weapon "auto-locks) on the enemies you aim at.\nOver all Paranautical Activity is taking too much influence from other games too the point where it is completely miss using what concepts it's taking. Difficulty in a game is fine when presented in increments, but I haven't even made it past the first level.","February 10","false","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is far less depth in terms of item synergy, item creativity, and strategy, but this is a fun game. The level design is good, the graphical style is simple and effective, and monsters all have distinctive designs and attack patterns. Most importantly though, firing weapons in this game just feels really damn good.\n\nIn conclusion: If you ever wanted to see The Binding of Isaac done as an FPS, this is the closest you can get as far as I know.","August 2, 2015","true","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Mixes ideas from Binding of Isaac with first person shooters that has a Quake/Doom feel to it. The replayability isnt too great at the moment (This review is being written while it is in early access.) Also The devs have mentioned they are working on multiplayer co-op and are also going to be adding a ton of new content. I have yet to beat this game but it sure does provide a challenge in the later levels. (Things crawling on the walls, projectiles everywhere, etc.) I would say this game is worth buying. It's really fun and quite a challenge and i'm sure once the Multiplayer co-op with all the new content is released it will be even better. I'd give it a 8/10 because there are some minor flaws such as it needs more content (Items to be exact, maybe more weapons aswell. Not to mention maybe some more room layouts.) but other than that it's a great game and I highly reccommend giving it a go.\n\nAfter Early Access edit: Well, the old developers went completely haywire and did some stupid stuff, but now there's a completely new owner and hopefully they take the game in the right direction. My old review still stands as it is still pretty fun to play.\n\n2nd edit: The new devs have done absolutley nothing. This game is just a mess.","December 3, 2013","false","26.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Trying to use any of the 4 main weapons to fight most of the enemies is a real challenge.\n- Classes are pretty useless. They all seem to be extremes with only 1 balanced class. Other classes include, guy with 1 hp, guy who moves slower than a rock, guy with ultra useless weapon.\n- Extremely repetitive locations. Every room is the same as the last and it's the same shade of blue most of the game.\n- Floaty controls, the movement just feels wrong. View bobbing is annoying too.\n- Colliding with oddly placed staircases and other pointless structures.\n\nOverall:\nI don't recommend this game. Each play session is so damn short it's ridiculous. No matter how many times i try and with any of the classes, I rarely make it to the 3rd floor. Often getting hit by things I can't even see or are unable to dodge with the slower classes. It lacks content, isn't very fun and gets very repetitive very quickly. Unless you like shooting the same enemies in the same rooms with the same 4 textures using awful weapons, stay away from this game. There are many better shooters out there. The roguelike elements aren't used in any interesting way here either. Just another excuse to stretch out a game's length when it otherwise lacks content and substance.","June 9, 2015","false","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I open it up again and it goes to the loading screen and freezes, I've tried many thing to fix this. So I don't know other peoples experiences with this game but in my opinion, if it freezes and can't open from me getting an achievement this game sucks. Thanks Paranautical Activity.\n\n\nEDIT: Although what I said here is true, I'd like you to ignore it. I was able to fix the problem with not opening. It still for some reason on macs it seems, freezes whenever you get an unlock in game or a steam achievement. I'm not sure how to fix it. I find that the game that you can actually play itself is really fun and interesting and amazing. But I keep crashing so until I either 100% it's gonna keep doing this. If you're not on a mac like me I recommend this. If you are on a mac. If you're able to fix this problem. Well better for you.","May 27, 2015","true","14.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
