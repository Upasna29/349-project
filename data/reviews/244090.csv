My maneuvers were weak and so was my aim. I shot down a few but was lost a little later behind enemy lines. Next up came my partner who seemed to fair better but unlucky for him he was terrible too. One by one what was once a total of four slowly became none after failed missions over and over till we were all lost behind enemy lines with no way of escape.  This is the sad story of our our lost soldiers of war.\n\nAce Patrol: Pacific Skies is a casual strategy hex-grid style game. You control four total pilots which you maneuver around the board trying to take out the enemies. When you start you have a very limited choice of movements. Over time you earn upgrades and better planes to help you out against tougher and tougher enemies. You are scored on each mission on how well you perform. The more you get hit or if you lose a pilot your points drop.\n\nThere is a total of eight areas with 4 missions to each one. You will fly around at Pearl Harbor, Midway, Okinawa, and a few other locations on the pacific. You can still fail a mission and move on to the next one. You'll just end up with a lower overall score.\n\nPacific Skies is not a bad game and you can get it for fairly cheap. It also comes from the great Sid Meier who has a fantastic game making record. So if you enjoy a little challenge, WWII history, or Sid Meier games I recommend you try this game out.\n\nBear Rating 8/10","November 25, 2013","true","1.7"," 63 of 79 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","63","79","2","6"

The premise is really interesting and I think the game mechanics are nicely executed. The planes each have a different feel, and the game does a good job of modeling "energy fighting" (e.g. trading altitude for speed and vice versa) and roll/turn rates (a P40 will roll left/right within a hex; a Zero doesn't roll so good but can sustain a turn to 120 degrees, etc.)\n\nBeyond that... it's a good thing this game is just $5 because it is woefully under-polished, especially for a Sid Meier title. The missions are very repetitive (180 are claimed, but they're really a variation on four or five missions with different enemy planes in them), the animations are clunky, and there are endless small boneheaded things that will annoy you.\n\nIt's very good for a tablet game, but I can't give it my full recommendation.","January 23, 2014","false","8.9"," 29 of 31 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","29","31","0","0"

Ported to PC. And yes, normally this would basically make me not even consider it.  But AP: PS is such a unique game, gameplay wise it's a great buy.  It's cheap to buy,  no fancy graphics or animations.  But the gameplay is quite complex and UNIQUE.  A strategy game that is even slightly unique hasnt been invented in like forever.

And the missions only last like 8-10 minutes each.\n\nIt takes turn based military to another level, each place has stats, each pilot has stats, and together they earn gear and movesets.  And by mid campaign you can pull off some SWEET tag teams with your planes.  Hiding in clouds, fly upside down over someone so they can't shoot you next turn.  The ways each move can play out once your in battle are insane.\n\nIf it sounds good, get it.  I would LOOOVE to see more of this made just for PC.

It's set during World War II; where players have the choice to play as the US Navy, US Army, Imperial Japanese Navy, and Imperial Japanese Army. It certainly has a familiar presentation for those who played the original, but it’s also more polished and enhanced. The mission set-up is different as players are given one mission instead of a choice between three. I also find the visuals to be more polished and likable, but that's probably because I love the old warbirds.\n\nPacific Skies offers that same great strategy, though these aircraft are capable of additional moves and tighter turns. This means facing an enemy ace can be a daunting task. It’s always important to keep the enemy aircraft out in front. If not, players can lose position and fail to shake the enemy off their tail - eventually being shot down. I’m reminded of this often as I’ve made the mistake of going in heavy for an attack on multiple occasions. This led to an enemy aircraft getting in prime position to shoot down my plane. This is why the strategy of Ace Patrol is so much fun for aviation enthusiasts and strategy fans. It’s a game of chess that takes place in the skies above. If players make one wrong move, it could very easily be check-mate for their aircraft.\n\nThere are multiple difficulty levels to choose from so it can be a very fun and causal experience for those who play on easy. The rest of us that like a challenge will enjoy the harder difficulties, even when things get impossible. It's exciting, and that means everything in a game like this.\n\nWith each mission there is one objective, and once players complete it they can fly back to base or shoot down the remaining aircraft to finish the mission. Obviously, shooting down the remaining aircraft is perfect for getting high scores on the many available leaderboards, but sometimes that might not be the best idea when players have damage on their aircraft. It's still fun to bait an enemy aircraft with one plane while coming from behind with another. There are also endless chases where players wait for the remaining enemy to make one wrong turn so they can finally shoot it down.\n\nPacific Skies is a wonderful enhancement on the original Ace Patrol, giving players even more strategic aerial greatness to enjoy. It's a fantastic strategy title with its simple controls and gameplay mixed with good objectives and tough difficulty levels. It really leads to some of the best strategy that can be found on the App Store. Plus, there is online multiplayer to keep players busy beyond the 180+ missions. Go fly over the Pacific, Ace Pilots!","January 15","true","71.3"," 25 of 32 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","25","32","0","0"

These are turn-based dogfighting/fighter mission games.  Think of them as a lite version of the Wings of War boardgame.  These days, IMHO Sid will put his name on anything, so it is good to read the reviews and watch the previews to see if it is something you like.\n\nFor me, it was.  I think I got this game for less than USD$3 and it is worth it for that price, as you will be challenged, you will go down in flames a few times (or more) and you will get 25-30 hours of turn-based gameplay out of it.\n\nIf this kind of game is interesting to you, or the strategy around dogfighting or ground attack missions interests you, then I think you will find it interesting.  If you think this is an action game, you will be immediately disappointed.  This is more like chess in the skies, and as such a novel and interesting twist on several genres.\n\n8.5/10","June 14, 2015","true","32.3"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

There really aren't that many historical air combat TBS games out there, so it is hard to compare it to anything else. It feels a bit like a smartphone-port, yet the controls work well so I cannot really say that this is a drawback in itself. The game IS casual, so do not expect it to have overly much complexity to it. The core of the game is assigning different maneuvers to your pilot(s), trying to put them in the best position to shoot down the enemy. As you progress, you unlock new maneuvers and gain new planes and improvements.\n\nPro:\n*Simple, engaging pick-up-and-play gameplay.\n*Both sides are balanced the same.\n*Has a certain charm to its style.\n\nCon:\n*Not that much depth to it.\n\nSummary:\nA fun little TBS game that will cater to your desire for a casual TBS experience, Ace Patrol: Pacific Skies is worth its pricetag so long as you do not expect anything with too much depth and complexity to it. 6/10 - Recommended.\n\nFor more recomendations and reviews: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/strandedkerbonaut#curation","October 1, 2014","true","11.6"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","12","13","0","0"

If you can look past the ugly mobile-phone-graphics it's a pretty deep game with plenty of strategy and tactics. Choose between several missions and complete the objectives using one or more (max 4) pilots. Make enough kills and your pilots will level up allowing them to use more/better maneuvers during battles. This can be critical later on in the game.\n\nYou'll also be able to unlock perks by completing secondary objectives. This, for example, allows crashed pilots to get right back into action after being captured by the enemy forces. And yes, better planes can also be unlocked.\n\nAce Patrol isn't a very long game and it's best played in short rounds, but like I said, it's good fun.\n\n[Rating: 70/100]","February 2, 2014","true","3.0"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

Yet, this game reminded me of Civ 4 so much. For the first 3 hours I have played the game non-stop. It was more like "Just one more mission and then I'm off". Well, that never happened.\n\nThe game is relatively easy to start, provided you do the training missions to understand what is going on. Quite a bit of reading to do to learn all the manoeuvres but its worth it. You are able to play the game at your own pace as it's turn based. But I would say that rushing you turn without thinking is not a good idea as sometimes it can result in a failed mission and a few captured pilots. There are two sides to play for: US and Japan. At the base your are able to hire new pilots and upgrade your planes. The pilots can learn new skills on level up. There are a lot of skills to choose from, so you must pick wisely. The planes can be custom painted which makes it so easy to recognize which pilot is flying it.\n\nI really enjoyed the soundtrack in the game. As any Sid Meier's series that I have played the music doesn't get in the way of your experience, because it's quietly sitting there in a background and making your gameplay much better. The voice acting is simple, yet very nice. I actually laughed a bit at Japanese ascent, but I think it's good. The graphics look like Civ4, so it looks quite old. It doesn't really matter for the game of this size thought. I think it's suites the game just fine. Nothing really stands out, everything looks pretty good.\n\nIn the end I can say that this game must be in your library, no matter if your a plane fan or not. Its just a fun game to play.

If you are low, you can't use a power dive (drop several levels of altitude) or "falling leaf" (drop several levels of altitude and face a specific direction), for example, or if you were in a left turn, you can't immediately switch to a sharp right turn (unless you learned "roll" manuevers). This is harder to explain than to see for yourself by watching the videos.\n\nYou control 2 or 4 planes and corresponding pilots. As pilots make "kills" they gain experience that can be translated to better power moves. So it's not good if you let one pilot do all the killing... Share the bounty.\n\nIn a bit of ahistorical equality, there are female pilots (fortunately, you can turn that off).\n\nTry not to let your pilots get shot down. They can be kept prisoner or end up in hospital for several missions. The planes themselves can also be damaged and repairs are not instantaneous.\n\nTypically you have about 6 missions per "year" and there's a big mission at the end. and 4 years in a campaign. You are scored based on how much damage you caused, did you complete your objective (such as taking out a ground target), vs. how much damage did you suffer.\n\nIf you like Ace Patrol, Pacific Skies is the same game with faster planes.","June 18, 2014","true","1.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

It's a fun strategy game that can be played either in short bursts on over a long period of time(1+ Hours). In many ways it improves upon the original Ace Patrol, such as more modern planes, new maneuvers, better plane customization, and more detailed maps. But in they totally ruined the feeling of choice the first Ace Patrol had, where you can choose what types of missions you wanted to do, where you did the mission types you liked and avoided the ones you didn't, except for when you were desperate for points to win that Defense/Offense and that mission type you didn't like had bonus points that period.\n\nIn both Ace Patrols a campaign consists of alternating between offense and defense, with each offense/defense having 5 battles. Each battle you got to pick between 1-3(1 being the final battle) different mission types. So the whole offense/defense you got to choose your favorites.\n\nIn Pacific Skies(this game), It's still a Campaign with 5 alternating Offenses/Defenses and 5 Battles each, but now you can pick your mission type. It just randomly picks one, which BLOWS.\n\nBeing able to pick my favorites, or picking my disliked types when I wanted variety was my favorite part. Since enemy Squadrons would rotate pilots between battles, so if the current battle had pilots you didn't like, you can choose a more defensive mission type. But that's gone in this game.\n\nAnd for some ungodly reason, they removed the full screen option. It was more convenience than anything else, but I see no good reason to remove it since Pacific Skies is basically a retexture of the first game.\n\nAnyway, as a final comment: Unless you hate the planes in the first game or love the planes in this game, just get the fist Ace Patrol, it's better. Though this game is still good too, I guess.","April 24, 2014","true","2.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dpxmsk/recommended/244090/","dpxmsk","DeadPoolX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dpxmsk/","1183 products in account","Sid Meier's Ace Patrol: Pacific Skies is the sequel to Sid Meier's Ace Patrol. This is not a carbon copy, however, and more was done than simply swapping models and textures.\n\nSo what's different? Primarily the setting, although quite a few game mechanics have been changed.\n\nAs the name suggests, the game takes place in the pacific theatre of war. The only nations involved are the Empire of Japan and the United States of America. Unfortunately, this reduces the overall choice the player has, since they basically get the option of choosing Army or Navy for either nation. At least each branch has their own planes, so you'll only see a F6F Hellcat when playing the US Navy or a P38 Lightning when playing the US Army.\n\nI have to admit, it's somewhat disappointing the only two options are the USA and Japan. Granted, that's to be expected given the location the game takes place in, but I enjoyed having four different nations to play in Ace Patrol. I can understand the decision to take this route, as the war in Europe would've looked even more like a rehash of Ace Patrol. Even so, the multi-national feel of the first game held more appeal for me.\n\nLike the first Ace Patrol, you have four pilots. They can earn promotions, gain abilities, get callsigns (which give them a unique trait, such as becoming immune to anti-aircraft fire), become injured or captured by the enemy. There's also two new options available: you can make all pilots male or have both male and female (like the first Ace Patrol), and you can allow pilots to die.\n\nUnlike the first Ace Patrol, abilities are no longer tied to the pilot himself. Instead, these abilities are installed on the aircraft. That means each new aircraft you get has no upgrades, even if the plane itself is better in numerous categories. Fortunately, you can switch back and forth between all planes, so if you liked an older plane more than the newest one, you can fly that.\n\nOne reason the ability to switch between planes is important because, unlike the first Ace Patrol, aircraft damage isn't repaired after every mission. Instead, damage persists until the campaign is over (admittedly, campaigns are only four missions each, so they don't take much time to complete) and then your plane is fully repaired.\n\nThe only exception is the "Grease Monkey" callsign, which lets that pilot repair their plane in small increments after each mission. Callsigns are presented after shooting down seven enemy planes; however, which four callsigns you have to choose from (for each pilot) is selected at random, so you might not see "Grease Monkey" appear or all four pilots could be offered it.\n\nAnother change is that you no longer get to select which mission you fly. In the first Ace Patrol, you could choose between three missions (sometimes only one was available, but in those missions the entire squadron flew), but in Pacific Skies, the mission is given to you. As each campaign consists of four missions, you could easily end up flying the same type of mission four times in a row.\n\nThe game's graphics are no better (but no worse) than Ace Patrol, except for one area: the pilots themselves. This may be a personal preference, but I preferred the way the pilots look in Ace Patrol. In Pacific Skies, they look like deformed bobble-head dolls. Even more confusing is when pilots gain rank, their emblems or pins don't change, they just gain extra pieces of flight gear. Gain a rank and you'll get goggles, for instance. Sometimes medals don't even show up, despite the fact you were told that pilot was awarded one as well.\n\nWould I recommend Pacific Skies? Only if you really liked Ace Patrol and you've got a strong interest in World War II, particularly the pacific theatre. I don't think Pacific Skies is as "fun" as the original Ace Patrol, but I've always had a stronger interest in World War I than World War II, so perhaps that's my own personal bias getting in the way.","January 12, 2014","true","18.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Normally that's okay but when the first Ace Patrol game had it and this one doesn't...\n-There's no graphics. No I'm serious, you load into the game after the main menu (which as graphics) and your presented with a choice of who to fight with. On this screen you see outlines of planes but no color or graphics. Next you get to chose a pilot from 4 different portraits which, some how, look uglier than the first game.\n\nAfter all that you get to pick your first mission... if you can find it. the plains are bright purple, the background textrures are black, you can't see any buttons to controll your planes and the game is just unplayable.\n\nReading the forums there have been many threads about this yet the game has never been updated. So avaoid at all costs, go play the original Sid Meier's Ace Patrol, it's much better.","March 25, 2014","false","2.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I am now enjoying this game now that i got it working.\nYou can play as japan army and navy , or usa army and navy. There is 3 save files. The graphics are ok but if you want the highest grade this game is not for that.\n\nThe game play is very easy to get used to. You click on the arrows to move the planes. Then the computer takes its turn. You can also set the game to be as hard or easy as you want.\n\nOne final though about this game. It allows you to customize the color of the wing tips and rudder. This can be very helpful to know which poilt is which on your side.  And you can upgarde the planes with add on mods you get after winning a battle. Sometimes the poilt will level up and you can train new skills to use.\n\nOverall rating inmo  7.5/10  if it succesfully works on your computer.\n\n[Important note: DO NOT buy if your using XP operating system it will NOT RUN.

These are turn-based dogfighting/fighter mission games. Think of them as a lite version of the Wings of War boardgame. These days, IMHO Sid will put his name on anything, so it is good to read the reviews and watch the previews to see if it is something you like.\n\nFor me, it was. I think I got this game for less than USD$3 and it is worth it for that price, as you will be challenged, you will go down in flames a few times (or more) and you will get 25-30 hours of turn-based gameplay out of it.\n\nIf this kind of game is interesting to you, or the strategy around dogfighting or ground attack missions interests you, then I think you will find it interesting. If you think this is an action game, you will be immediately disappointed. This is more like chess in the skies, and as such a novel and interesting twist on several genres.\n\n8.5/10","July 24, 2015","true","29.7"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","4","8","2","0"

It comes with most of the other features of the previous game (randomised pilots you can name that can earn RPG traits and manauvers through experince whilst fighting randomised missions between 1-4 AI pilots using hex combat in a turn based system) and it is especially worth it after playing Ace Patrol.\n\nPacific Skies takes place the era of warfare where planes have shifted over to faster engines and single wings. Thus the turn based combat is slightly deadlier and quicker than in the prequal game but the aim is still the same (get on their six cover your own). The art assets of course are very very different and much more varied. Both the two American and Japanese factions do dog fighting over land and sea and there are a few new twists added (Instead of Offensives it is now eight famous WW2 battles of the campaign with six missions each to do) like a mission to shoot down a pilot or towers to save one of your crashed pilots from a POW camp. Plane customisation has improved, you can now paint five different part of your squadrons plans with a varied amount of WW2 flight insignia.\n\nWhile like Ace Patrol there are a few minor once in a blue moon issues with the tiles (I had a mission where an enemy pilot just few into a tile and vanished from the game, assumed crashed) it played a straight up solid indie title like previous game. So in total and in my genuide opinion getting this and the older WW1 themed brother together during a sale will entertaining you for a solid 22 hours in total for a first run on each game.","December 1, 2013","true","12.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

But since Ace Patrol: Pacific Skies is basicly the same game with a different skin, this'll have to do. :-)\n\nThe game might be incredibly good for all I know. But because I belong to the vast majority of people being unable to play the game because of frequent crashes (eventhough I meet all the required specs) and since there is literally NO SUPPORT TO BE HAD from the developers/publishers who seem to be happy just taking unsuspecting people's money and trying to give workarounds instead of ACTUALLY FIXING WHAT'S WRONG WITH THEIR GAME (I mean, they tell people to unplug USB-devices, change the sound bitrate on their system, turn off MSAA and movies in the game, for crying out loud!) I would recommend people to get hold of two older games; either "Achtung Spitfire!" or "Over the Reich". Both of these games are vastly superior in graphical assets (though they are not in 3d), realism and playability. And since Ace Patrol shamelessly rips off these two old gems, I find it a really easy choice.\n\nThe only reason to buy Ace Patrol or Ace Patrol: Pacific Skies is if you get it, like me, in a bundle (but don't bother installing it) OR if you want to perpetuate a company getting away with selling a product that in most cases does not work as specified or does not work at all.

It is very basic in its design, set in the Pacific during WW2, you can choose to play as either the Japanese Imperial Navy or the US Navy.\n\nIn terms of challenge - On easy there is very little skill involve - simply get behind your opposition, not in front of them, and continue to shoot them until you've defeated them. As you increase the difficulty the challenge really does ramp up and you will need to plan what manueveres to upgrade your pilots with and understand how and when to use them, it becomes like a chess game.\n\nI was dissapointed by the use of famous naval battles to represent each chapter, the opening page of the chapter gives you a very basic run down of the battle, however the subsequent fights have no relationship to the so-called setting, they are literally just randomly generated engagements based off the same 4 engagement types - Combat Air Patrol, Search & Destroy, Recon or Escort. Really it either needed to be related or it could've just been called "Round 4" or something.\n\nI prefer the original version, at the end of the day there is a bit more variation in it than this one and you get to choose the engagements which means you can choose to challenge yourself or avoid doing that one engagement type that you've become bored of.\n\nOverall if you like turn-based tactical or even if you're just a fan of WW2 it could be and interesting way to waste a few hours.","August 9, 2015","true","6.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Each side takes turns performing various maneuvers with a handful of aircraft from both the American and Japanese Army/Navy. Most missions are simple, ranging from one on one ace combat, reconnaisance, bombing and zepplin attacks.\n\nPilots add another layer of strategy as they level up with successful kills. Each level allows the player to choose from three different sets of maneuvers for that specific pilot. Should the player keep damage levels above 50% in a scenario they will gain a part unlock to attach to a plane. This comes in the form of accuracy, damage, speed and maneuverability upgrades.\n\nAll in all, a wonderful game with high replayability. The only difference I have noticed between this and the first Ace Patrol is purely graphical, slightly faster plane speeds and higher damage ratios. Recommended at any price!","May 19, 2014","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Which would be fine, the game is pleasant enough and scratches that X-wing:miniatures itch somewhat.... Unfortunately and unlike the first game, this one crashes every two or three turns...

Sadly nearly no new features were added but solid gameplay over all.

I didn't know that or I wouldn't have bought it. The idea could be really cool built up to a pc release. However as a limited phone game it got highly repetitive and boring very quickly. Also the shoe horning in of female pilots in WWII is just silly. A lot better things could have been put into the game with that development time.\n\nWorst game to wear the Sid Meier label.","February 1","false","42.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
