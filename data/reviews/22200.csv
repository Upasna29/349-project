"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/22200/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2816 products in account","Zeno Clash is a beat'em up style fighting game with a dash of first person shooter added into the mix. This game uses Valve's Source engine and was released in April 2009. The xBox got it's version a year later in 2010, but for some reason, got a "Ultimate Edition" with content that cannot be accessed on the PC version.  You play as a young warrior named Ghat, and you are on the run from your family as you have accidentally killed your father in an explosion. You have a female companion by the name of Deadra who helps save Ghat along the way.\n\nThe gameplay is whilst looks like it is a very generic fighting game, it feels different. I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but the gameplay seemed a little off to begin with. The tutorial gives a very good introduction into the basics of fighting and dodging, as well as helps you along the way with controls and early combos.  You have the usual quick attacks, powerful attacks, dodges, and blocks as you would expect. Zeno Clash also adds in a little gun combat too, which again, almost feels a little bit off. There is no auto reload on the weapons, which is not always a bad thing, but most fps style games now days at least auto reload once you have emptied your round/clip.  You also cannot fire you run unless you are looking down the scope of it; meaning you will probably end up throwing your weapon around a lot like I did as I was just trying to shoot from the hip.\n\nEvery level is essentially a fight scene, you have a set amount of opponents which are introduced at the start of each stage, and the aim is to kill them, simples. Zeno Clash has a very good aiming system meaning you can rotate between various different enemies and have the camera automatically face the location they are in.\n\nThe majority of Zeno Clash's graphics are really top notch; something we should expect from a Source Engine game though. This game is six years old and still looks like a current generation game in my eyes. I played this on a 4K resolution and it looked absolutely stunning (for the most part). Where I ran into a weird graphic problem, was the tutorial. I am not sure whether it was a bug or glitch for me, but the resolution/texture quality/anti aliasing, was absurdly bad on all the tutorial scenes.  I really didn't know what was happening, I went from looking at a stunning 4k rendered world, to something which looks like a SNES has just produced. Like I said, this only happened for me on the tutorial levels, the rest of the game was absolutely fine.\n\nZeno Clash has a good story; one that has a lot of olive branches into a few smaller stories, but focuses on the main story for the majority of the time. The game ends well and will leave you wanting to find out more about the world of Zenozoik (I just love the name of this place!).\n\nThis game has three levels of difficulty; I played on normal and had a sufficiently challenging playthrough, there are no points which had me running against a brick wall for hours - I had to retry a couple of times. I can see the harder difficulty to be a real challenge though, since the handicap fights can get real hectic if you don't keep track on where all of your enemies are at ALL times - you will end up getting your head beat in from behind and you won't even realize.\n\nA full playthrough of Zeno Clash's story mode took me just about five hours; the rest of the time I spent in the challenge mode, which allows you to climb a tower and have your scores ranked every time you beat the final boss. In total I got about fourteen hours worth of gameplay out of it, so for £6,99, I am very happy with that outcome.\n\nOther than the strange graphical glitches I had on the tutorial modes; I did experience a few crashes. This came from when trying to use anything related to the Steam Overlay such as screenshots, or shift+tabbing to bring up your friends list whilst in game; this instantly crashed me to the desktop. The game also doesn't have a manual save function, so you are relying heavily on the auto save feature. Normally when I am playing a game which I have experienced crashes on, I try to save as often as I can, so when I found out I couldn't manually saved, it made me very cautious and was often on edge hoping for it not to crash, which somewhat spoiled the experience for me.  I also had a problem where the game would not count any of my achievements,  whether this is because of the issue with the Steam Overlay or not - I'm not sure.\n\nTo sum up; I will recommend Zeno Clash as a very good PC game; it's standing the test of time very well, has some very nice graphics, a compelling story line and decent gameplay. If you don't experience any crashes or bugs, then you will have yourself a welcome addition to your Steam library in this game. If you can't really overlook the issues; then this may be one of the only times I say to try the console version out since that sounds like it is virtually bug free. Thankfully Steam does have a demo up for this game, so you can try it out first before purchasing - which is something I would highly recommend you do.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Only recommended when on sale\n3) Recommended\n4) Highly recommended\n5) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ericjdouglas/recommended/22200/","ericjdouglas","koala fish mutant bird","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ericjdouglas/","561 products in account","xeno- prefix. from Ancient Greek ξένος (ksénos, “alien”) a. Having to do with foreigners, as in xenophilia, or more commonly, xenophobia. b. From a foreign place, as in xenolith.\n\nclash noun. onomatopoeic a. A skirmish, a hostile encounter. b. Opposition, contradiction, such as between differing or contending interests, views, purposes etc.\n\nIn my imagination, the development of Xeno-- sorry, Zeno Clash -- started when folks at Ace Team got together, got high, and got onto the subject of ancient mythologies (Roman, Greek, Norse, etc.) and how weird they all were. I mean, if you want crazy characters and crazier stories, you need look no further than some of the gods and goddesses traipsing around back in the day. Athena, birthed fully formed out of the sweaty forehead of Zeus; Pan, the goat-god of wanton sex; Artemis, goddess of the hunt, who for some reason was depicted in various interpretations as being literally covered with breasts; Medusa, she of the stylish snake perm and stony gaze, being some kind of metaphor for psychosexual wackiness (I'm pretty sure we can blame Freud for that); Jeff, the God of Biscuits; and even some nutter who told people to eat some bread and drink some wine and pretend it was his flesh and his blood... I mean, ew, dude. I'm sure we have enough problems without adding cannibalism to it. So anyway, the developers were shooting the breeze about Gods and Golden Fleece and rivers of blood and whatever until one guy, as I imagine it, stood up and went, "Yeah... but like, what if... Dude! What if there were, like, aliens, right? And they were weird, like totally, heh, but then, like, THEY also had myths and ♥♥♥♥! I mean... dude..."\n\nSo that's where this game comes from, more or less. There is a distinct dreamlike quality inherent in the stories of myth, fantastical and larger than life, and that is the feeling you get as you find your way through the land of Zenozoik. It feels deliciously alien and new, in the visuals and in the story (neither of which go out of their way to make a lot of sense, but it's still easy enough to follow). You'll see and hear a lot of weird stuff, and sooner or later, you just go with the flow because it's weirdly seductive. Even running on the old Source engine, and looking a bit dated now in 2015, the art and design and imagination of the dev team comes through in nearly every area so that you will truly think you are in fact running around on an impossibly, impossibly alien world. Luckily, they do at least have one thing in common with us here on Earth: they really like punching the stuffing out of each other.\n\nIf you've seen anything about Zeno Clash you already know the basics: it's a first-person brawler-shooter. Way more emphasis on the brawling than the shooting, thankfully. You, a fugitive on the run, have a modest set of fighting moves at your disposal, such as light and strong punches, blocks, dodges, counterattacks, grabs and throws. Unfortunately, so do your opponents for the most part, although they will also attack you at range if they get a chance. You get a small selection of weapons yourself, and they come in handy once in a while but the majority of your combat will be served in knuckle sandwiches. And they were never so tasty: combat feels fantastic in this game. It's fun, responsive and fast, with a good amount of variety (though there could be more), and it's super satisfying to land an uppercut on some chump and watch him go flying. I didn't really think I'd enjoy such a melee-focused FPS but after playing this I stand corrected, it's ridiculously fun. I even enjoyed the few bits where you are required to tote a rifle or another firearm, although I am glad those bits were few. They're not bad, really -- the rifle in particular sounds great, and it's amusing to plunk away at dudes with the double-fisted handguns -- but save for a couple spots you won't really get that much of a chance to use them because enemies will do their best to rush you if you're shooting at them, and none of the weapons are viable at close quarters.\n\nOne thing you will notice right off the bat is the voice acting, and it is... hmm. How to describe it. Well, your first impression will probably be "Oh my god this is bad." And you wouldn't really be wrong, especially with regards to the main character. He is, let's say, from the same acting school as Christopher Walken and William Shatner, only he flunked out hard. His lines are awkwardly paced, and weirdly inexpressive; he speaks in a stilted, matter-of-fact tone. All of that might turn you off -- which is why I'm mentioning it -- but honestly, his weirdness actually fits the game very well. There is often dialogue that sounds so insane on paper, but because of the way he delivers his lines, it instead sounds believable and ordinary, which makes the bizarre setting of the game even more bizarre. All in all, it works for me. It may not work for you.\n\nIt's not a very long game (ignore my obscenely long playtime), but it's a fully-formed, enjoyable, weird as all hell story that will have you doing at least one or two double-takes because you have probably never heard sentences like these in a game before. The fighting is hard and fast and so enjoyable, the world is filled with delicious weirdness for your eyes, and the trusty Source engine shines through even for a six year old game. I don't know about you, but it absolutely charmed the pants off me with how little Ace Team cared for making the "right" game, and made a fun, unique, and beautifully bizarre one instead.","June 19, 2015","true","90.8"," 45 of 50 people (90%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","90","45","50","6","14"

Fight your way to the truth of an unhinged world through mobsters, monsters, deranged beings and dark creatures.\nZenozoik is a wonderful, vivid world, but this is no paradise. Forget the tales about the 'good savage', for this land is full of secrets and violence. Find out the reason of the brutal hunting you suffer from your own brothers, the secret crimes Ghat has come to know. In this first journey in Zenozoik, there'll be some revelations, but also questions that'll make you wish everything hidden to be brought into the open.\nThe world ACE Team has created is really unique, and you'll always feel that there's much more to see... and to fight. Because Zeno Clash is above all, a brawling game, and it excels on it. The extraordinary plot backs an addictive and satisfying combat system, and luckyly the game includes modes beyond the main history which will sate your thirst for beating throwing you right into the action, in the increasingly harder stages of a tower which progressive destruction will delight you by its smart use of physics.\nZeno Clash is an indispensable, which will remind you why some games deserve to be considered art; exalted visuals, surprising lore and relentless fights await you.

See Conclusion\nINTRODUCTION:Zeno Clash is a first-person melee fighting game developed by ACE Team using Valve's famous Source Engine and released on Steam back in 2009.\n\nThe story begins with Ghat, the game's protagonist, waking up after being knocked out by an explosion which killed a creature known as Father-Mother who is the leader of a very powerful mafia like family in the small town of Halstedom. The protagonist Ghat is presumably one of Father-Mother's children who turned rogue and ran away from home and is now being pursued by his 'brothers and sisters' (enforcers of Father-Mother). Join him and his companion Deadra in a quest to discover the truth of about Ghat's past and trace back the series of events that led to the explosion.\n\nPROS:+ Excellent use of the Source Engine\n+ Good fisticuffs (melee) combat mechanic\n+ Surreal world and environment\n+ Complex but enjoyable story\n+ Interesting character, item and monster designs\n+ Item variety\n+ Good sound effects and voice acting\n+ The Devs were probably high during this game's production\n+ Challenging difficulties\n\nCONS:- Extremely short (4-5 hours game time in my last playthrough)\n- Almost no replay value (except for the tower challenge mode)\n- Difficult learning curve\n- Story is a bit difficult to follow\n- Short linear levels (In my opinion, linear games are fine as long as the levels are lengthy and enjoyable)\n- No character progression (no armors, level ups or item upgrades)\n\nCONCLUSION:GOOD GAME. Zeno Clash sports a very unique art style that places you in a very surreal world with a strange geography and is populated by strange creatures all brought to life by the developer's clever use of Valve's Source Engine. The combat mechanics is fun albeit a little frustrating at times and hard to learn however, the items does give variety to the player's fighting style. The game should provide you with at least 4-5 hours of game time with its campaign with an added 'Tower Challenge' if the player wants to test his skills.\n\nI RECOMMEND this game mostly for the experience but the short game time could be an issue, still though, Zeno Clash is a fun game to play. I can't honestly cannot recommend it at full price (even if it is only $10 or your regional equivalent), so getting it on a sale is probably a better idea.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

The world and story is of new mythology.  Fighting system is challenging, fun, annoying, and very immersive.  For the most part the game is moderate difficulty from beginning to end.  Some of the fights can be easily beaten once you find a weakness in the A.I. or level design.  The game favors freaks who love originality.  The short length was perfect for the story.

I have gained a number of concepts and ideas that will occupy my daydreams for the next month or so.

Set in one of the most creative worlds I have ever witnessed, this game stands out as a real gem to me.\n\n+Well-developed melee fighting where you can lash together combos, strike quickly or strongly, or pick a median attack. Blocking, dodging, countering, finishing. Many great moves to help you deal with the situation at hand.\n+Ranged weapons that work fairly well from dual-wielded pistols, rifles, crossbows, or 'grenade launchers'. All very imaginatively designed in a way that they're nothing like you'd imagine based upon how I just described them. Unfortunately they make some fights a little too easy, but without them those same fights would have been a bit too hard.\n+It's challenging, but not unfair. Many games today are either too easy, or designed unfairly to promote difficulty. Zeno clash is almost the perfect median between the two.\n+The voice acting for the characters is simply splended. Every voice actor was given strange roles to fit, very specific roles, and they all nailed them with excellence.\n+Great and memorable characters. From the moral-less Ghat, to the kind and caring Deadra, to the mysterious Father-Mother and all of his-her sons and daughters you face throughout the game. To the also-mysterious Golem, and even to the many unique Corwid you face throughout the game. Oxameter and Gabel being the most memorable.\n+The story is confusing to begin with, but as you progress and learn more about what's happening it is fantastic. Absolutely great. Unfortunately it ends in a bit of a cliff hanger but that's fine! We have a sequel available to us!\n+The world is simply stunning. The setting is so unique and refreshing, I just want to experience more and more of it. Give me more!\n+The music fits the game so well! Matching every moment almost perfectly! Well-arranged tracks as well.\n+A challenge mode to keep you entertained after you beat the main story, which is well needed since....\n-I finished the game in a little over 3 hours. And the challenge mode will keep you busy for about one extra hour, which is nice.\n\nI give this game a solid 9/10.

The story is strange, the characters are mysterious, and the player is left continuously wondering what will happen next.  Unfortunately, the story is also not interesting. The game just throws disparate scenario after scenario at you presented as a series of events that happened before the beginning of the game, and it leaves it largely up to you to connect these events.  The characters are not expanded upon, the enemies are only briefly expounded on, and the main characters motivations are left entirely unclear.  I believe this was a choice made deliberately to add mystery to the story, but for me it only left me wanting for a clear reason to continue to my goal.\nNone of this would be a problem if the game was fun.  I don't need a reason to complete the game if I enjoy playing it.  Zeno Clash is unique in that it tries to blend melee and ranged combat in an FPS in a way I've never seen before.  The melee portion includes blocking, counter attacks, dodging, grabs, and other staples of good melee combat.  The mechanics of the game is what brings it down in this respect.  It would take a long time to describe exactly how frustrating it is to control the combat, but I frequently ended up performing the wrong defensive move which would result in my taking damage.  Furthermore, the counterattacks don't work.  Almost every time I tried to counter an enemy they would block or dodge my counterattack.\nThe ranged combat has similar problems.  Guns are not meant to be used exclusively.  You are supposed to pick up a weapon and shoot an enemy as many times as you can until they get close to you.  This part feels good.  Watching an enemy running towards you, it feels great to score those two big hits that send them flying on their back then pelting them with more shots until they start towards you again.  When they start getting closer though is when the frustration begins.  When an enemy gets close, you are meant to lock on to put away your weapon and begin melee.  However, running away from an enemy breaks your lock, so if you are trying to get away, the gun comes back out.  If you are hit with the gun out, it drops to the ground with whatever ammo it had, where enemies can pick it up and use it against you.  In short, again, the mechanincs of this game make it very frustrating to do what you want to do, and to fight multiple enemies.\nIn conclusion, I wanted to like this game.  I like wierd games, I like difficult games, and I like story-driven games.  I HATE frustrating games, however, and this falls squarely into that last category.  The mechanincs of combat don't work, the story was not holding my interest, and I felt no reason to complete the game.  In addition, I found a Zeno Clash process running in the background of my PC even though I hadn't played the game in days and the game itself was not running, so my hours played are inflated.  I should note I did not finish this game.","June 28, 2014","false","9.1"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

Of course, the latter will probably result in disappointment. Don't let the buzzwords (quirky, awkward, weird, crazy) fool you. The game is (though I loath to use this term) "quirky," to be sure, the story and voice work have an awkward, disjointed feel, as does the game's art style. Trust me when I say this is all intentional on the part of the devs, and isn't just a pointless dive at becoming the strangest thing since Vangers.\n\nIf you have ever been told this game is "deep," it's because of the revelations of the sequel, Zeno Clash 2. Anyone suggesting you play the first part of a series because of how much THEY enjoyed the revelations of the second part is like someone watching Return of the King, going bananas over the charge of the Rohirim and suggesting you pick up the extended edition of Fellowship when you have no experience with LOTR whatsoever. You will not enjoy it. PLAY THIS GAME WITHOUT ANY EXPECTATIONS WHATSOEVER. Ignore the exaltations of your peers.\n\nAs for how "quirky" and "awkward" this game is, like I said, it's intentional. There's a suitable comparison in the 1984 movie Scanners. The protagonist is a man who has been mute his entire life, and suddenly regains the power of speech. It's not very well elaborated upon in the film, but his social skills and speech patterns are completely out of whack because of this: he has to develope these skills almost from the ground up. The people who inhabit the world of Zeno Clash have a similar problem, which is elaborated upon in the sequel; again, perhaps explaining why people think this game is so "deep."\n\nGameplay is fairly simple and quite challenging. First person hand-to-hand is a very peculiar form of gameplay, particularly when it's as complicated as it is in both Zeno Clash 1 and 2. Though there is a limited variety of enemies, they all have unique fighting styles which you will have to adapt to in order to succeed. Enemies will fake you out, surprise you with the reach of their attacks, suddenly overwhelm you with a flurry of blows; to this day, whenever I pick up Zeno Clash I'm regularly intimidated and surprised by the combat, in spite of having played through the game multiple times. It's no surprise that some players are frustrated by how unpredictable it is and even reject the game entirely, dismissing it as quirky nonsense.\n\nTrust me, just have patience and work on your timing. Pick some good battle music and play the tower challenges. You'll probably find it as enjoyable and satisfying as I do.","November 1, 2014","true","26.4"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","13","16","0","0"

Seems like simple fun arcade stuff right? Sort of is, but there are added features to the game (beside the campaign) that make it significant.\n\nThe storyline is a good one to say the least. There is a guy who trains you in the game and by the time he's done training you, he simply kills himself. This game is whacky, weird, and odd, but how it all comes together within the world is awesome. When people speak about creative games, this one definitely takes the cake with it's outrageous characters. Besides the game play, the characters alone will make you double take. They are given personalities with extreme oddity that simply makes it appealing. I fought a boss who jumped on top of a bunch of dinosaurs while trying to kill me for pete's sake. I really like the fighting engine and the added features of being able to pick up guns, crossbows, and other sort of crazy weaponry like blunt objects that send opponents flying. When you fight, it actually feels like you're making contact with the opponent. The feedback in the punches was done phenomenally.\n\nShould you buy it? On sale I would say unless you REALLY like these types of games.\n\nFor future Zeno Clash games I would recommend multiplayer, and maybe even dare to try to incorporate local co-op. To add to the fighting, perhaps add kicks or even allow for players to hold down the mouse button, then use the mouse to swing to determine the type of swing. Don't make it to the point where people start snapping their mouse cord, but something decently close enough.\n\n8.2/10\n\nget's an extra .2 for being a breakaway new type of genre.","July 21, 2014","true","4.9"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Too often it basically consists of flailing your arms with no force feedback until the enemy falls over (see Elder Scrolls).  Which is a a shame, because when these types of games do show up, they tend to be pretty awesome.\nAs you can guess, Zeno Clash has good melee combat.  It's fairly simple, but it feels good.  You can dodge and block, punch and throw to your heart's content.  My only real complaint about the combat is that at times it feels a little barebones, especially because the game doesn't force you into most advanced techniques.  I rarely dodged or blocked in my playthrough (although I have yet to do the tower challenges).\nThe melee segments are broken up by time with various other weapons, and a few boss battles.  I often found myself wishing I could go back to the melee combat (especially during the repetitive fights with heavy enemies), but even these segments were mildly enjoyable at worst and fun at best.\nThe game also has a pretty good story.  It's simple and short, but it's supported by a wonderfully strange world, and it's fairly engaging.  It ends poorly though, with barely any sense of conclusion.  The game ends up feeling like a prologue for the sequel.\n\nAll in all it's a very solid game.  Good melee combat, great world, fun variety of segments.

Extraordinarily impressive. An FPS focusing mostly on brawling and few weapon mechanics, the gameplay is not only innovative, but stunningly creative and chocked full of potential. The imagination used to create this game is off the charts: it's a cornucopia of color and design. ACE has left no stone unturned when  creating an entirely new world. Not only do they focus on the visuals of the planet but also the unique culture, technology, wildlife, language and the natives that inhabit this strange new land. When it comes to being engulfed in a whole new reality, I've seen few games do it as seamlessly as 'Zeno Clash'.\n\nWhile the gameplay is unvaried and by no means perfect, this reasonably short foray leaves you wanting MORE. For 'Zeno Clash', this is a good thing. This is one game that will have you chomping at the bit for a sequel.","January 14, 2012","true","4.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You can also do some advanced techniques like a super strong punch, a rushed elbow hit, and if you block then press your normal punch or strong punch button you can land a devastating quick kick. It's pretty simple. There are also weapons that have a small "magazine" (the best gun I found had 3 shots before I had to reload). You mostly walk in a straight line.  It is kind of dreamlike because even though it is linear many of the things from point A to B are cut out. For example in one part you are in the forest and then 5 minutes later (after a fight) you are in the coast. The gameplay is simple but fun.\n\nStory:\n\nWithout giving too much away: Ghat murders Father-Mother (the name implies everything). He is on the run and his girlfriend (Deadra) tags along cause I don’t know. You get many flashbacks that tell more of the story and you try to piece it together. He refuses to tell his girlfriend Father-Mother's secret (why he killed it). This game is kind of weird. See a couple of the screenshots and you will see what I mean. The world looks twisted and colorful as do the characters. People are weird and some talk in riddles. You definitely will be laughing at some points in the game.\n\nDefinitely get it.

Made in the Source Engine, Zeno Clash is nothing but oozing in creativity. From the zany monster design to the intriguing weapons, the game creates an original setting the likes of which are not often seen amongst games these days. Although I mentioned weapons earlier, the meat of the games combat comes from the brawling segments. Through the usage of a stamina bar and several combos and counters, Zeno Clash attempts to be a first person fist-fighting game. In this it succeeds, though it will take some time to get used to the combat. It draws certain parallels to Dark Souls almost: both games have heavy and light attacks, blocking, and parrying. The games does so many things right such as introducing all fights with cool illustrations of the foes and breaking up the gameplay with various weapons, boss fights and changes of locale, that it doesn't fall hard to forgive it for its biggest flaw, namely voice acting. It being an Indie game and all it's not hard to understand why the voice acting might be less than stellar, but its a minor point that shouldn't impede anyone's enjoyment of the game. Zeno Clash is, among other things a first person brawler done right with one of the best fantasy settings in modern games.","December 6, 2014","true","10.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Zeno Clash's dialogue, artstyle, characters and environments are all unique and work well together to tell a short, but interesting story. A lot of it doesnt make any sense in the beginning, but I think that just adds to the experience. Combat is a very strong aspect in Zeno Clash. It is a first person brawler with bits of shooting thrown in. The bulk of the combat will be punching and kicking the ♥♥♥♥ out of everybody. It can get to be challenging once more enemies get in it with you. Mastering the block and parry system can be difficult, but it will definitely be rewarding, since a sucessful bloack/parry combo can send an enemy flying across the screen. Theres nothing more satisfying than being able to do that. Also, you can kick the ♥♥♥♥ out of people while theyre on the ground.

The world is imaginatively designed and the music, while not particularly special is a nice mix of tribal music.\n\nIts a short and linear adventure at around 6 hours. Gameplay is a hit and miss. When the punches connect, they feel satisfying. However, it is frustrating when hit detection goes wonky. There is also a lock-on mechanic, while useful in theory, is a hassle when you need to get away from enemies. While there are also guns, they have too little ammo and load much too slowly to be effective in combat.\n\nThe story is simple, but the way its presented is confusing and the characters aren't very memorable. The female sidekick you have doesn't help much at all in combat and would have been much better if she can be used as a co-op partner.\n\nOverall Rating: 6.5 / 10\nNot worth to buy full price, but worth a look if on sale.

Combine those possibilities with the physics engine turns to be a LOT of fun!\n\nThe weapons are very easy to use. Most of them have unlimited ammo but need to be reloaded properly. If you want to put your weapon away for a melee fight, you just need to "lock on" to an enemy.\n\nThe levels are pretty small but it works for this title.

The gameplay, while could be improved, is admittedly quite nice, and has a nice ebb and flow to it. However, this does not mak up for it's other lacking mechanics.\n\nIn addition to all of this, for the amount it costs, it is a frustratingly short game, and lengthing it would also improve the value immensely.","November 28, 2014","false","3.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

During the beginning of the game, things won't be very clear except that the supposed brothers and sisters that are a part of this family accuse you of killing Father-Mother. More is revealed as you progress in the game and you eventually find out the truth. Personally, I won't go into further details about the story to avoid spoilers.\n\nThe gameplay is very unique in such a way that you don't often see this genre...This game plays in a first person perspective but your use of combat isn't through weapons (there is ranged weapons in the game, but you won't always be using them) instead, you use your fists to beat the ever living crap out of whoever stands in your way. You can lock on to your enemies and switch between which can be handy for quickly knowing when to defend or attack. At some areas of the game, your fists alone won't be reliable enough to hurt some enemies as some of them can vary from big enemies who charge at you and can knock you over resulting in some nasty damage or you have creatures that spit crap at you. So what do you do when it comes down to that? You use weapons! You can pick up some unique looking weapons that help from dual welded bone like pistols to a crossbow that fires skulls that explode upon impact with your enemies or you can have a bone sledgehammer that can deal massive damage to your enemies as you charge your swing.\n\nThe level design is incredibly trippy but that's likely what the developers were going for as the world of Zeno Clash is incredibly unreal and is full of plenty of strange yet pretty scenary.\n\nZeno Clash also has a unique tower mode which you unlock levels of as you progress through the main story. In the tower mode, you are inside a tower killing every enemy in the room to progress higher into the tower and you also also put against a time which shows how long you take. The timer isn't all too important as its just to put you against your friends to see who's faster at the level. As you progress, you'll meet all the different enemies you have met throughout the main game and in some rooms, you will have weapons that you can use or disarm from your enemies. But in the later levels there will also be room hazards that can be useful for killing your enemies in one fell swoop but be careful! As if you aren't, you can also be killed quickly.\n\nAll in all, Zeno Clash is a incredibly fun game where you beat the crap out of people and I recommend checking it out if you're looking to punch in some faces! Plus, if you buy it and own Garry's Mod, you'll get all the models from the game!","March 31","true","7.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The melee combat is innovative and challenging. The story is so different that you'll spend most of the game being confused and wanting to know more.\n\nThe story is one thing, but the scenery is astounding.

Another reviewer referred to it as "Stonepunk", and I feel that is an appropriate description.\n\nThe first part of the game was interesting with the blend of first person fighting and gunplay, but by the end of the game I was more than ready to be done with it. The story and characters are mediocre at best, and the game is quite short. The combat, which starts out relatively fun, degenerates into a repetitive slugfest with you constantly getting overwhelmed by more enemies than you can keep track of (including snipers) and it simply ends up being not fun by the end.\n\nOn top of that, the combat controls were glitchy and didn't always register, and there's some major issues with enemies being invincible during most animations and your character getting stuck in a corner and taking a ton of damage. The icing on the cake is the baffling control decision to have the block/dodge key also throw your weapon, which makes fights with certain types of enemies far more difficult/annoying than they should be since the only way to harm them is with a melee weapon, but they almost always block your attacks if you're in front of them. You basically have to sprint in a circle around them (and they still hit you half the time from angles you wouldn't expect, and do a ton of damage) when you should be able to dodge and counterattack (they can do it to you, why can't you return the favor?).\n\nOverall, when this game works, it's a satisfying first person brawler, but when it doesn't it is one of the most frustrating and annoying games I've played in awhile. While not a completely terrible game, it has enough issues and little enough content (you fight against the same dozen or so characters over and over again in the course of the game) that I can't really recommend it unless you got it for next to nothing in a bundle like I did.","May 9","false","3.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

When I started, almost from very beggining I was put in fight, after two or three fights I closed game. I was wondering, when I will play it again. Combat system in Zeno Clash isn't bad - it's fine but also very annoying. I can't count how many times I got attacked from behind, but that's not what was annoying, the thing that comes after - not sure if it's bug, or if it should work that way, but almost everytime my character was performing once again last action. If fighting, in this kind of game, doesn't bring much pleasure then what is point of playing? This is easy question - THE WORLD AND CHARACTERS LIVING IN IT. This is most interesting part of game. I love every place and character this game have. With every next hour I wanted to know more. I would really love to see Zeno Clash as adventure game. I know I would have much more fun exploring new places, talking around and such than fighting. Well, that's just my opinion. If you love exploring bizzare worlds - Zeno Clash is good for that. Still, there is plenty of fighting, which can be hit or miss in case of Zeno Clash.

I started off rather curious and open-minded and felt that I was initially rewarded by a quirky but fun game.  The storyline had me intrigued, and as I continued to suspend disbelief and ignore a handful of "game logic" moments and repetitive fighting, I had hope that things would get better soon.  I was terribly mistaken.  After about 4 hours of gameplay, it feels like the dev team ran out of ideas and money.  Characters you've already fought are thrown back at you time and time again, and the story completely falls apart.  The ending is without a doubt the worst ending I've ever encountered in a video game.  The game rewards you for believing in it's surreal world by kicking you straight in the nuts as you realize all of your confusion was entirely justified.\n\nUnless you love the beat em up style and are prepared to fight the same characters using the same moves over and over and over again, AND can ignore massive plot holes, bad voice acting, and an unbelievably stupid story do NOT buy this game.  Not even on sale.

You must fight your brothers and sisters on your journey to confront Father-Mother. The story unfolds through cutscenes and flashbacks and is really eccentric. The areas and transitions feel quite disconnected initially, but near the end it starts coming together, things get interesting and the ending is satisfying.\n\nThe combat isn't simple or intuitive and it'll take you a long time to learn advanced moves like dodging and countering attacks. Even the easiest difficulty will be frustrating if you don't master this system, so there is some skill involved.\n\nThe game looks great with nice art, but the soundtrack is mediocre. It's short, lasting only a few hours if you don't try for achievements or challenge modes.

There are more than 10 different fighting moves, without regard for any of the hand-held weapons, but with time you will find certain combinations to be most effective.\nDuring a one-on-one fight you can easily achieve a nice, powerful rhythm - however, when there are many enemies it can be difficult to single one out to focus your efforts.\nFor less gung-ho players this may result in the tiresome process of wearing multiple enemies down one jab at a time. Drop a grenade amongst foes to speed things up.\n\nFrom this you may infer that too much of one thing can become dull, so luckily this tedium is broken up by special enemies that require more than fisticuffs.\nFor example, heavy-set enemies can be overcome by using evasion or timed attacks to bring them to a state of vulnerability. Large, mentally-unstable enemies' weaknesses must be exploited to bring them down to your level so that you may cure their neurosis with, you guessed it, more punching.\nThis does something to alleviate the familiarity of the dodge-punch-block-kick reptition of fighting, though these types of enemies are, too, used repeatedly.\n\nSore knuckles and noses is not the only draw card for Zeno Clash, and if you aren't going to play for the combat then please play this game for the fantastic artistic design - for the music, visual art and script.\nI found the surreal landscapes and the outlandish flora and fauna to be both beautiful and unsettling. The ramshackle settlements and deformed, (often literally) animalistic citizens had me yearning to see what grotesqueries would arise next and I found this incredibly engaging for the duration of the game. The voices are many and varied, highly emotive and serve to easily differentiate the actors and how they feel towards the protagonist - as well as showing their individual strengths and weaknesses of character.\n\nIf you appreciate well-executed gameplay and beautiful art direction then I believe that you will enjoy Zeno Clash as much as I did.\nIf you have played it already then I urge you to buy it for a friend who has missed out.","December 29, 2012","true","10.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The game consists of several martial arts battle with one to several opponents.\n\nThe only real complaint I have with the game is that the controller support is terrible and I could not get it to work with my 360 controller well enough to use it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CrossSection/recommended/22200/","CrossSection","Cross-Section","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CrossSection/","394 products in account","TL;DR – The most this caveman brawler gives you in terms of plot and setting exposition is a moderately-short blurb on the game’s store page. Also, one of the enemy models closely resembles a *ToTaLLy MEtAl* version of the Swedish Chef from “The Muppet Show”. Recommend.\n\nOnto the review:\n\nIt’s actually to Zeno Clash’s benefit that it doesn’t really explain itself outside of the basic gameplay mechanics, which are simplistic but nevertheless require a bit of finesse if you’re playing on any of the higher difficulties. To elaborate, combat is your typical mouse-bound primary-light-attack, secondary-heavy-attack affair, utilizing the spacebar for blocking and evading. Uncoordinated lout that I am, this was interpreted as “spam the secondary/primary and run around like a chicken sans head”. This "style" of gameplay actually worked for me, thanks to the normal-level difficulty setting I was playing on, in addition to smartly-placed health items in each area.\n\nUnfortunately, this is also the likely cause of the game’s growing tediousness later on, as, outside of a few close calls and even some deaths, I was just smashing through opponents in area after area. To offset this, there is some variety in the stages; for example, a brawling sequence being followed by a shooting gallery level, or some other contrivance (like using a magic torch to light up pyres and moving statues alike). And the guns, oh the guns.\n\nIndeed, the weapons in Zeno Clash most succinctly sum up the game’s overall art aesthetic; the closest comparison in décor is that of “The Flintstones”, with its brightly-colored yet naturalistic designs. Hell, there’s even dinosaurs (or at least large reptiles resembling them) in a level or two. The guns themselves specifically piqued my interest, as the idea of a primeval-era slugthrower is just surreally fantastic. For example, the pistols, which basically appear to be carved shells with a bunch of nails and rocks stuffed into them, are just fun to look at and use in all of their pea-shootery goodness (which may also explain why I keep running into the same named characters again after I so thoroughly obliterate their asses).\n\nBesides the art design, this sense of backwards absurdity is ingrained in the plot and characters; outside of the aftermentioned blurb, the game leaves it up to the progression of the narrative itself to explain what the hell is going on, eking out small bits of info through dialogue and actions. It's a refreshing break from grandiose blocks of text that describe a game's lore in exacting detail, but I fear the world of Zeno Clash might still be too alien to experience without detailed explanation for some players. At the same time however, it's that same feeling of unknowingness that may spur other players (myself included) to push on and immerse themselves in the absolute weirdness that is this game.\n\nFinal words: Zeno Clash is so aesthetically "out there" that it may dissuade players from digging into it, but the fairly-conventional combat system, in addition to a relatable (if somewhat vague) storyline, signifies that this 5ish-hour-long brawler is still worth playing for a couple of bucks.","June 14, 2014","true","5.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/recommended/22200/","peterhollo","CorvusCorax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/","533 products in account","One of my first purchases here on Steam. I believe it was back in 2009 if I remember correctly and it did have a very nice discount on it so it was immediately in my basket.\n\nZeno Clash is an ambitious first person shooter game developed by ACE Team and released in 2009. The game uses the modified version of the Source Engine so it runs very well and while it is somewhat of an aged engine it still - in my opinion - looks good.\n\nInterestingly, rarely do you have the chance to use weapons with projectiles; emphasis is on melee combat and you do have the chance to use some clubs or other heavy weapons beside your fists. Combat is simple but very smooth - the game is very linear and as it is an independent game you can already guess it is quite short.\n\nStory-wise the game is rather silly - it puts you in the shoes of Ghat who is banished from his home after an attempt to kill Father-Mother. Yes, this creature is his father and mother as it seems the entire population of Ghat's settlement was raised by this hermaphroditic creature. Although banished, Ghat wishes to uncover the truth as to what really happened and what secret lies with the family.\n\nAnyways, combat is quite good and the game has a challenge option with levels of a tower to compete against a series of enemies. This is getting difficult gradually - a nice way to pass time once the story mode is finished.\n\nZeno Clash is somewhat mediocre, but I believe the result of an original idea. If it is on sale this is a highly recommended game.","June 28, 2014","true","11.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

PLAY IT! PLAY IT YOU ♥♥♥♥!". Now I concede: I really hate this game and never want to play it again.\n\nYes the design and aesthetics are quirky as all hell, as are the story and dialogue. I actually love that about Zeno Clash; it's like a weird off-cut of early 2000's forays into 3D alien architecture that takes cues from someone who spent too much time flipping through microbiology books.\n\nOn the surface the controls aren't difficult and combat seems manageable, if a little grating at times. I hate blocking mechanics even moreso when your dodge or evasion system is tied to it with movement. Using weapons is a pain in the ♥♥♥ because you can't dodge with a weapon and if you're not quite in range you start kicking insead of swinging your weapon. Also it won't let me use a controller which is god damn insane. The only thing I like about the combat is how visceral and meaty it can feel at times, when it isn't completely disorienting and aggravating.\n\nBut perhaps all these problems are solely on me, and my desire for a dodge roll button or a lock-on system with a smoother option to switch between targets is an admission of weakness? I really wanted to like Zeno Clash but god help me the combat is really awful and controls like ♥♥♥♥. Maybe the sequel magically fixes everything? I don't know and I don't care to find out.\n\nTry to get it on sale or in a bundle, but if you don't like it you shouldn't feel bad.","October 27, 2014","false","2.2"," 15 of 29 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","15","29","0","1"

It's both great and well... incredibly average, but it's satisfying from start to finish.\nThis is a short game, you can easily complete it in about 3 hours. It's a kinda sloppy melee first-person brawler.  Its combat system isn't bad, but it gets clunky at times, specially in group fights. However, punching enemies into a 5 meter flight makes you feel like a badass. And the ragdoll physics on the corpses are a nice touch as well.\nI haven't played Zeno Clash 2 yet, but I will soon enough, and I assume the combat system has been polished since 2009, although I've heard it focus too much on team fights, which is where the clumsiness comes in... But I digress.\n\nThe game shines in its world and characters, which are all really weird, but at the same time, charming. They present neat ideas that feel like they should have been much more explored and fleshed out, but everything seems experimental here, hence its length.\nFor example: "The Corwids are not slaves of reality, so they can be insane. Oxameter walks in a straight line without letting letting anything change his path... and that's what Oxameter does." There are other Corwids with interesting... "features", so I'd definitely recommend picking this up if you're interested in them alone.\n\nNow, another problem I have, in regards to the exploration of the world, is that, since the game goes from one arena to the others, you barely have any time to explore the areas and take the time to appreciate the world they've created. While you're in combat, you'll be busy to look around, and the scenes end as soon and you beat everyone up. This still leaves you with an idea of what it is, but too vague for my liking. Again, I hope Zeno Clash II solves this "issue".\n\nVoice acting is pretty bad, but it's bearable, and didn't ruin the overall experience for me. The cutscenes follow the same route, with some cheesy animations, but again, that wasn't my reason to be playing the game, so it didn't really make much of a difference.\n\nSo, for the conclusion. If you're interesting in world, creature and character design, this is definitely a must-buy. They've done a great job there, I thoroughly enjoyed it!  If you're coming for the combat system, or a grand scale story... well, you'll not find it here, not quite. Still, I'd encourage you to pick it up on a sale, since it's a very interesting game to play.\nWell, I'm off to play Zeno Clash II now, I'm definitely interested in what comes next.

The story was pretty mediocre, but they constantly pull you along with the promise of this huge secret right around every corner. So I was constantly driven to play to figure it out, thinking I was getting closer and closer. Near the end you can figure it out and it’s honestly quite a letdown. The world is interesting and unique, but none of the characters are fleshed out enough for you to really care for them. I have to imagine they had an amazing world in-mind, but were limited in how they could present it. Still there’s plenty of mystery and yearning to find out more.\n\nThe gameplay is fluid and has some fun melee components. It's unique in how the game almost plays out like an arena/fighter and FPS game. I had some issues with the controls, like accidently throwing my gun around into unobtainable places, but all in all the combat remained challenging (but not frustratingly so) and never dull.\n\nRegardless of the game's flaws, I can't deny how enthralled I was in the game within the short time it took me to beat it.

It had the potential to be something a LOT greater than it turned out to be.  Without disclosing any major spoilers, let me just say that once you get to the ending, you'll realize that the whole game takes place in some sort of endless time-loop, with Ghat (the protagonist) being the victim of a false accusation...\n\nYou'll also come to realize that the creature called Father-Mother is being "outed" (which is the game's sole redeeming aspect)...\n\nAnd if all that brawling was still not enough for you, there are post-game Tower levels (multi-level arenas) where you can duke it out to your heart's content.  Personally, after two playthroughs, I had had enough already...\n\nOverall, it's a "refreshingly-unique" kind of game, and a recommended play.  Check it out.\n\n---\nAdditional note:  For all you other "discerning" gents out there who prefer to see beautiful women in games dressed a little more "interestingly", there is a mod available for Daedra that accomplishes just that quite nicely.  Without giving the links, do a search for "Zeno Clash - Deadra Mod" (found  on Fileplanet dot com), then run it with the free Texmod app (dmcmods dot com).  Works well.

The character and terrain designs oscillate between beautifully surreal and head-scratchingly mismatched. Everything you see is a wonder to behold and, however improbable, feels as if it belongs there, feels alive. Following Ghat around as he tells his tale and very slowly reveals what he knows was thrilling. No matter how many times he refused to say more, I didn't feel like I was being stalled because it was clear how deeply the secret affected him. His character was fully formed and relatable. But the ending itself felt rushed and not quite as climactic as it seemed to think it was. The big reveal was satisfying, it was the lack of answers pertaining to the newer character that the conclusion centered around that made it somewhat hollow.  If said character was not introduced and the plot remained focused on the conflict between Ghat and Father-mother, I would have no complaints about the storyline. The combat, however, has some issues. Combat is the bulk of game and it never feels quite right. The sights and sounds seem right, when a blow connects there's good feedback, but I never could tell what was and was not going to hit me. The enemies will become invincible at times, during charge up attacks and after being knocked down, which doesn't go along with how the combat itself is presented. There's also not a whole lot to the combat which is a blessing at first, but causes it all to become repetitive later on. In the end, none of that is going to stop me from playing the sequel when the mood hits me, but I'm not exactly rushing into either.","June 11, 2014","true","18.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Maybe it was OK for 2009, maybe. I got this on a bundle and have been determined to beat it more than once. The problem is its boring. The story is not engaging, the voice acting is awful, and the combat is clunky. As far as I can tell this game was only rated so high because of its wacky visuals. Woo.\n\nThis is a point to point brawler. You walk some you fight some dudes. You walk some more you fight some more dudes. There are no alternate paths to explore and there will be invisible walls stopping you at every turn. Intermixed with the fighting and walking are "cut scenes". In these the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ voice actors force out their bizarre dialog in such a way you can tell they are confused by what they are saying.\n\nThe combat is crap. Step forward a little and punch. Either a 3 punch combo by holding left mouse or a strong attack on right mouse. There is also a dodge by pressing space bar and an arrow key while locked into melee. I never found a use for it though. Sure it gives you a chance to counter but it was hard to time right. It was much easier to take a step back, wait for the attack animation to end then walk back up and spam mouse one holds. This tactic works on every character until the end of the game. Trying to use strong attack pretty much always resulted in me getting hit before my attack would launch. Now don't let this make you think I had difficulty with this, I was owning every boring clunky fight. They added some additional fight mechanics towards the end of the game. I don't remember what they were though because I didn't use them.\n\nI eventually just gave up my quest to beat this ♥♥♥♥ game at the end. I beat the first round of guys easily taking minimal damage. The problem was the two guys on the roof shooting me with crossbows. All I could fight back with was a wildly inaccurate grenade launcher. I tried to lob a couple grenades up at them but the just picked me off easily with shot after shot of highly damaging, rapid fire, homing cross bow shot. I tried to dodge and lob another grenade. Only to watch the ♥♥♥♥ing cross bow bolt follow me and hit me.\n\nThis is where I gave up. This game isn't worth it, I don't care about the weird ♥♥♥ ending or in fact any part about the story what so ever. 4/10, it works, the visuals are cool enough to make you stop and look around for a few seconds, everything else sucks.","July 24, 2015","false","4.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The setting is a tribal culture, and the story revolves around the main character being accused of murder.  Weapons are sparse and primitive; the highlights are definitely on the "brawling", fighting hand to hand.  The moves and timing can be hard to learn at first, but beyond the learning curve engagements are very satisfying.  Levels are linear and boss fights are varied in execution.  The visuals and characters though MUST be experienced.  Its a short romp although there are some challenges to complete.

Making a beat-em-up in a first-person situation was about as clunky as you could imagine, but it came out much better than you'd think. Still, it felt unfair and needlessly frustrating at times. It has a very 80s feel with the design looking like it came out of The Labyrinth and Dark Crystal with the tone of Mad Max and Water World. Zeno Clash is beautifully rendered too with the scenery and chaacter models ooking like they could actually have been made out of clay. The combat, which is the core gameplay, was solid and satisfying despite it's short comings. Never thought I could use the mouse and it feel like I'm really punching somebody! The voice acting is very flat and the story is very shallow, but the story didn't need to be very deep and the awkward voice acting added to the surreal and abstract feel of the whole thing. The music fit the atmosphere and the mood perfectly, similar to Abe's Odysee. I felt like that's probably the sounds you would hear in that universe. Zeno Clash is an easy recommendation for anyone looking for a fresh first person experience with some unique challenge.","February 26, 2014","true","7.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The first person brawler combat is clunky, some fights are way too hard and crowded, the graphics are just ok and the voice acting is very bad at times. But I still recommend it simply because of the experience it is. The game is really short (finished it in one sitting) but it has one of those weird stories and takes place in such a strange land that you can't help but see it through. And at the end of the day, I had fun with it, which is all that really matters. Just don't get too aggravated when you die for the 6th time running around being chased by a pig-man and a rat-man while crazy people throw exploding skulls at you and you try to fight them off with guns made of fish bones.

It's weird and cool to use those same strategies from a different viewpoint. There are some gun weapons and some grenades, but this game is all about brawling, and usually multiple things at a time. The characters have that Henson feel with an almost claymation texture or quality. Still, don't mistake this for an adventure: it's a fighter, and if you aren't good at them or aren't into them, you're going to have a rough time. Thankfully each battle plays out as a "chapter," so you don't have to worry about losing progress, you can pick whatever chapter you want to play.","July 15, 2011","true","0.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The setting is a tribal culture, and the story revolves around the main character being accused of murder.  Weapons are sparse and primitive; the highlights are definitely on the "brawling", fighting hand to hand.  The moves and timing can be hard to learn at first, but beyond the learning curve engagements are very satisfying.  Levels are linear and boss fights are varied in execution.  The visuals and characters though MUST be experienced.  Its a short romp although there are some challenges to complete.

Bad hit detection in general, slow and repetitive combat, poor AI and pathfinding, you can run past your enemies walk off a "barricade" and then get stuck because you can't jump back to the previous section and so cannot kill the enemies to progress, you can hear the hitting sound without doing any damage, if somehow the AI manages to gang up on you you can die in almost no time, since you keep getting stunned and can't land hits before they do, counter-attacks often do not register and so on and so forth), makes it a very unenjoyable experience.

The player must use an arsenal of punches, kicks, and throws--along with the occasional club or primative firearm--in a robust combat system that requires proper positioning and timing in addition to good awareness of the surroundings, as the player is outmatched 3 to 1 in every fight if not worse, and the opponents are just as strong as them.  All this is set in a visually rich world that borrows from many ancient and tribal cultures, creating a unique immersive experience.\n\nApproximate Length:  5-6 hours.  Additional arena challenges add a few more hours.\n\nPROS\n(+) World & character design is creative and genre-defying\n(+) Accomodates a variety of combat playstyles\n(+) Difficulty is well-balanced and punishes mistakes appropriately\n\nCONS\n(-) Enemy AI is simplistic and can easily be exploited\n(-) Stages are often flat and open with minimal obstacles\n(-) Plot is disjointed and many things are left unexplained\n(-) Suffers from sporadic game lag even at low settings\n\nOVERALL:  Zeno Clash is a "weird" game, in setting, character design, story, and even in the base concept of a first-person brawler.  Weird games are a good thing; it shows that game designers are being creative and testing the limits of what a game is, or what it can be.  However, for all its creativiity Zeno Clash falls just short of a positive experience.  The combat system is enjoyable, but simplistic arenas and simplistic enemies that value quantity over quality quickly make it tedious, and the points it wins with its inventive setting are taken away by the fact that it ultimately does very little with it.","April 3","false","10.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/futome/recommended/22200/","futome","Claire✿","http://steamcommunity.com/id/futome/","322 products in account","Regardless of some of the games shortcomings, this game is highly enjoyable with a very pleasurable 1st-person brawler experience makes for some very solid gameplay that is refreshing to enjoy.\n\n\n\nI want to get right into things and talk about the combat first. The combat is fun and is surprisingly fluid. Probably one of my biggest issues with the combat system is the enemies invicible times. Enemies can always override your attacks but there's a lot of times when enemies will commit to a attack and are completely invincible. Making it so you take unncessary damage and it kind of ruins the flow of the game I found. Sometimes you can't even dodge their attack when executing a perfect dodge to counterattack. But overrall the combat is fair game.\n\nIn the combat you are either using your bare hands to beat the living snot out of your enemies in a awesome intense fashion, or you're picking their health off with a gun from afar.\n\nThe combat keeps it very simple with the controls but also makes for some intense fighting. It's really hard to explain how the combat controls work via text over doing a live commentary for example and talking about how they work in the game itself. But the game has a what I'd say fair learning curve with a stiff challenge you may not be prepared for in skill yet. But ultimately you'll learn how to conquer your foes even if it has you going back a chapter or two to do some training. Which really isn't that big of an issue since the fighting in this game is fun as heck. You'll give your old enemies the one-two-puncharoo and you'll pick up some knew combat techniques (skill specifically, the game locks some advanced combat early game. But all results in combat are based on your skill and use of the controls) and be trained enough to learn how to take out tougher enemies.\n\n\nI liked the soundtrack, it wasn't perfect. But it was nice and I can remember a few specific tracks that fit my fancy. They fit the fighting scenarios well and they really helped you get into fights, I give them credit for making soundtracks that pumped me up some in a lot of these battles and levels.\n\nThe art directive was really strange, I wouldn't say it was memorable or enjoyable persay. But it was interesting to look at and look forward to for their next environments and people. Though I had an issue with the level designs. In the sense of the backgrounds. Everything a little above level eye sight which would be the middle of the screen was sickingly blurry. It was like this in pretty much every level. I had to keep my eyes on the ground and the middle of the screen or I felt sick.\n\nThe voice acting was poor in it's own right, but that doesn't really matter. Same with the story, the story was kind of weird and didn't really make any sense besides your were just running away from your home because of your actions. But the story and voice acting and art and some of the blurry vision in the levels really pale in how good the action in this game was.\n\n\nI know I didn't do a good job at explaining the combat at all, i'd definitely suggest watching a video of it on youtube. But the action brawling in this game is really good fun. It was an experience I was happy to partake in and i'm glad I played this game.\n\n\nI got this game through trading for it, for it was in a bundle. I heard the game was good and I gave it a try and i'm now here to tell you that is indeed the case. I'd suggest getting it price cut of at least above 5 bucks. Anything below that is just criminal. Though this game is priced at $9.99 or your regional equilivalent and I'd say this game is worth the full price. It's good and I can't say i'd feel bad if I dropped ten bucks on this game. Because even after beating the game there's a challenge mode in-which you beat the crap out of people for numerous amounts of floors and that's jolly good fun too.\n\nSo anyways, Zeno Clash. If you don't mind a game that is highly action-oriented and with great combat and that's very fast-paced and alive. Get this game, it's really enjoyable.\n\n\n\nAnyways, thank you for reading my review. I hope you found it helpful for considering if you want to purchase this game or not, have a good one.","October 18, 2014","true","7.1"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

The storyline is also pitiful and doesn't follow through with itself very well. The game actually leaves you on such a huge cliffhanger at the end of the game which refuses to explain anything which just happened, forcing you to buy the sequel to the game to actually find out what the ♥♥♥♥ it is that you just played.\n\nIn short, don't bother buying this game unless you have some money to waste.","December 13, 2013","false","3.7"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

It's only a couple hours long and is therefore objectively a waste of money, but if you can get it for cheap or just play a friends copy then I'd recommend it simply for the really cool melee combat mechanics. There are weird guns and heavy melee weapons but that ♥♥♥♥ blows ♥♥♥ like the rest of the game and its nonsensical story, bad voice acting, ameteur animation, etc. The one true redeeming quality is the punching and it's worth trying out just to feel how great it is to uppercut chicken men six feet into the air.","February 15, 2014","false","4.9"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

In Zeno Clash you plays as Ghat. Hes on the run from his brothers and sisters after he kills Father Mother. The story is simple enough you would understand but overall the game feels lacking. The story in itself is quite good and the twist ending does keep things fresh. But now about the gameplay. The gameplay uses melee combat to youre advanted. You bassicly lock onto an enemy and then you beat him up. Of course there are guns you can use but those are worthless because enemys rush you so fast you wont have time to reload them. Overall Zeno Clash is a fresh spin to the FPS genre but i felt that it got boring after a while and the difficulty spikes are a great dissapointment .

Zeno Clash. Oh my god, Zeno Clash. I don't even know what to say more. This is the most bat ♥♥♥♥ insane game I have played.\n\nStory takes us to the past (future?) to the Zenozoic. Our hero, Gath, is dead. But he is not, and he killed some being called father-mother, and now half of the friggin world hates him, so he runs away, while having shroom infused dreams of his master which is also dead. And that my friends is not a spoiler. Thats 5 seconds of the game. I won't tell anything more about the story, because for starters its quite good, and besides it doesnt make any ♥♥♥♥ing sence. At all.\n\nGameplay is as basic as it gets. We are running around in beat em up style, throu the linear levels and kicks everything until it stops moving. Here and there we will encounter some kind of diversity (which boils down to doing exacly the same thing, but with weapon). Its a classic beat em up with fps POV. Thats the whole shmuck here! That being said, ZC is HAAAARD. First stages are quite easy, even on harder difficulties, but after about hour in, when all of our moves are unlocked to us (and to our enemies), it gets really insane. AI is really good, it tries to play on our disadvantages by ganging up on us, dodging, blocking, all that kind of stuff. Even weapons can't help us, when we have low health and we get surrounded. And don't even get me started on the whole "tower" thing (its basically a survival mode), when they really got carried away with difficulty spike.\n\nGraphics... dear lord. Okay, for starters they are really colorful and pleasant for the eyes. We rarelly see any colorless or featureless NPC's or areas. The textures are really well done, sharp and neat, even thou the game is quite old. But then comes the models itself, and the game breaks itself. I mean, jeez, dev team of ZC feed on shrooms and drinks it with liquid LSD or something. Design of most places, NPC's, backgrounds, everything is bizzare and for the most part, ugly as hell. Imagine a person with american football shape head, big ears and nose, and torso the size of half of his head. And thats the most "plain" look anyway.

Zeno Clash. Oh my god, Zeno Clash. I don't even know what to say more. This is the most bat ♥♥♥♥ insane game I have played.\n\nStory takes us to the past (future?) to the Zenozoic. Our hero, Gath, is dead. But he is not, and he killed some being called father-mother, and now half of the friggin world hates him, so he runs away, while having shroom infused dreams of his master which is also dead. And that my friends is not a spoiler. Thats 5 seconds of the game. I won't tell anything more about the story, because for starters its quite good, and besides it doesnt make any ♥♥♥♥ing sence. At all.\n\nGameplay is as basic as it gets. We are running around in beat em up style, throu the linear levels and kicks everything until it stops moving. Here and there we will encounter some kind of diversity (which boils down to doing exacly the same thing, but with weapon). Its a classic beat em up with fps POV. Thats the whole shmuck here! That being said, ZC is HAAAARD. First stages are quite easy, even on harder difficulties, but after about hour in, when all of our moves are unlocked to us (and to our enemies), it gets really insane. AI is really good, it tries to play on our disadvantages by ganging up on us, dodging, blocking, all that kind of stuff. Even weapons can't help us, when we have low health and we get surrounded. And don't even get me started on the whole "tower" thing (its basically a survival mode), when they really got carried away with difficulty spike.\n\nGraphics... dear lord. Okay, for starters they are really colorful and pleasant for the eyes. We rarelly see any colorless or featureless NPC's or areas. The textures are really well done, sharp and neat, even thou the game is quite old. But then comes the models itself, and the game breaks itself. I mean, jeez, dev team of ZC feed on shrooms and drinks it with liquid LSD or something. Design of most places, NPC's, backgrounds, everything is bizzare and for the most part, ugly as hell. Imagine a person with american football shape head, big ears and nose, and torso the size of half of his head. And thats the most "plain" look anyway. My god, we're they doing some heavy drugs while developing this. And the whole game is like that.\n\nMusic is nice. They are upbeat loops, invigorating us to kick some bizzare ♥♥♥. Here and there we can also hear some slow, almost depresing tunes, mostly in cases of "despair" of our hero. Music TBH is the most powerful aspect of the game whatsoever. Sounds are also nice. Punching sounds natural, groaning sounds natural, and the "vs" screen have this little "pow" sound which gives a vibe of an epic fight.\n\nThis game is quite honestly really well made.

This game by himself is bad, the history is not deep and without too much sense as almost all the important elements will be in the second part. The first person perspective for battle is OK, but tends to be bad, I had problem in many battles because sometimes the enemies had greater reach and sometimes they didn’t. Although you can carry weapons they are very poorly implemented, and even worse, you magically changes them from scene to scene and his main sin: TOO SHORT, I played 5 hours trying to explore each piece of the levels and the infinite deathmatch but the main campaign can be made in just 2 hours.  But, if you has the second part and want the full experience of the franchises is a good expansion for that game (2 hours of OC, that is an expansion).

This game isn't the answer to that. If it had multiplayer, I could fully understand the appeal, but it doesn't even have multiplayer, all it has is a madly hard-to-follow story and interesting visuals. That's all it's merits. Sure it's in a nice niche of quick-time events that you just have to know when to do so, and it might take a fair bit of skill to really get good at it, but you don't have time for that. The entire game feels no different from Call of Duty in the way that along the story, you move forward and OOPS YOU CAN'T GO ANY FARTHER BECAUSE MONSTERS, and then it's just fight after fight, a cutscene that makes zero sense, rinse and repeat, and then the game's over; the only real difference being that in Zeno Clash the guns aren't even guns and your companion does nothing to help you even though she's probably capable. She just stares at you during your short-lived fights and makes no effort to actually drive the thing.\n\nAll in all, the game is too lacking to get a "yes" from me.","December 13, 2013","false","0.4"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

I am not going to not recommend you give the game a go even though I have rated it with a non-recommendation because this is probably just due to my personal tastes and since everyone's taste does differ there is a good possibility you could walk away really loving this title.\n\nSet in a far away fantasy world the game makes use of the Source Engine from Valve to tell its tale and it looks pretty decent and runs easily on modern machines. The fantasy world created is quite eye-catching but that was not nearly enough to keep me invested in the game which I found to be dreadfully boring and far too hipster for its own good. Even the convoluted story involving your character and his accidental killing of a creature known as Father-Mother and his then flight from the town he once called home all the while being pursued by his brother and sisters who are hot on his heels with the intention to kill him didn't really resonate with me either. I didn't really enjoy the fighting mechanics and got more frustrated with the game as time moved on.\n\nDon't go by what I say as anything gospel since there are many out there who absolutely adore this little title and you may end up being one of them.

It doesn't prooperlysupport controllers without some config file tweaking and even then you need a mouse to load your save. The easy difficulty can get pretty hard and autosaves can put you in a tough spot (fortunately, there's two so you can go back a bit further).\n\nThe combat is interesting, although I found it hard to dodge because it's a two-action sequence (block and then move) instead of a chord or single button. For controller users, there's no auto-aim for ranged weapons, I couldn't get the sensitivity low enough for precise aiming, and the reticle is hard to see so shooting can be difficult.\n\nThere's other minor things that feel unpolished like delays after finishing a fight where nothing happens and the bad voice acting of the main character, but I still like Zeno Clash because it feels so different. Your companion's voice acting is great, many of the other characters are good, the mix of melee and ranged combat works well enough, the world is beautiful and strange, and the struggle of the protagonist (while not sold through the acting) is interesting and isn't the standards save-the-world cliche.\n\nI finished the game on easy with a controller, but used buddha mode (through the console) to get through some tough battles (like the infuriating Hunter).","August 9, 2014","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Visceral first-person melee mechanics make combat very unique and engaging. Nightmarish character design and creepy voicework contributes highly to the game's fascinatingly surreal ambience.\n\nCons: The small levels and strict linearity in progression are disappointing since the world's imaginative environments would be a blast to explore. Also, gamplay can feel repetitive at times since other than dialogue, there is little to break up the consecutive bouts of combat. Some elements of adventuring and exploration would add much to the experience. The game is a bit on the short side with the main story clocking in at about 4-5 hours.\n\nOverall, Zeno Clash is well worth playing and is an experience that is sure to stick with you.

The game does actually have a story, although I'm not even going to try to explain it.  The artstyle is unique as well, combining tribal looks with a bit of smashed together 20th century sculpture.

They're committed to making unique games that stand out for their originality and quality.\n\nZeno Clash is exactly that; the use of the Source engine makes for excellent graphics and  a quality feel, while it's unique art style, story line, and melee combat system really sets this game apart from your typical half-♥♥♥♥♥ console port.\n\nJohnCover gives you his recommendation.","July 25, 2011","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LaCr0/recommended/22200/","LaCr0","LaCr0","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LaCr0/","283 products in account","This is a First Person Brawler with a simple combat system, original and out of the ordinary art style. Featuring a 2-3 hour story mode and another hour of challenges.\n\nGraphics: The game uses the Source engine (Half Life 2) so it has limited but memorable scenes. The art style is astonishing and  aestheticly looks like a wierd dream.\nI really want to see the concept arts or a sketchbook from the creator. Technically the game looks okay. There are low res textures, jerky shadows and low poly stuff. But the caracter design, the weapons and the environment...man this game looks and feels really uniqe.\n\nSound: The music just like the graphics fullfills this wierd dreamy athmosphere. There are many memorable moments thank to the great combination of them. Voice acting is cheesy but funny. The dialogues are genuinely funny and serious at the same time. The sound effects are basic public domain stuff.\n\nGameplay: Gameplay wise well... it's simple. The main scenario is arena fight. You get to a locked area and you have to defeat all the enemies. Imagine these like nodes in a graph. These nodes are connected by edges that are basically linear paths. And overall the game is linear and the level design is linear too.\nThere is a turret section as well but still has the stong dreamy athmosphere so it's okay. You will encounter little enemies, normal enemies, normal enemies with weapons (melee, ranged), brutes and bosses.\nThe little enemies are crabs, chickens and those big rabbit thingys. I think most of them just spit you acid liquid. Normal enemies are basically fighting partners. These guys can pick up weapons as well. Enemy vaiety is nice here because there are different models and fighting styles. Brutes are big, tough enemies and you better kill 'em with melee weapons. They take multiple hits as well. Bosses are easy battles, just like old times: wasd 'em and shoot 'em.\nYou can shoot only in ADS otherwise you swing the weapon towards the enemy. You can throw the weapons as well. Mechanically these are the same as in other games but they feel strange and uniqe in a positive way.\nThe melee system is simple and easy to learn. There are basic combos and advanced combos. The game does a good job teaching you these things in the tutorial sessions. There is a challenge tower for pro players. It's basically a fight fest. You have to climb the tower and defeat all the enemies. Things could get hard here... :)\n\nReplayability: As I mentioned the Singleplayer story mode is linear and each replay will be the same. But if you liked the story and the wierd things in it, I'm sure you'll give it another go. However the Challenge Tower is pure gameplay and fun and absolutely replayable.\n\nOverall:  Pros:\nShort but entertaining Singleplayer mode\nVisceral combat\nSimple and fun melle system\nUniqe aesthetics\nInteresting art style\nDreamy music\nCons:\nShort Singleplayer mode\nLack of MP features\nMediocre sound effects\nNothing special in technical level\nLinear levels\n\nVerdict: A nice game from the indie developer, Ace Team. I had great fun with it.\nI recommend this game for those who like fighting games, wierd fiction, and for those who's time is short and want a short game.\n\n","April 13, 2015","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is whacky and entertaining too. Be warned that most the gameplay is brawling against opponents. There's some shooting segments and a part which plays almost like a tower defence kind of thing without towers, but in my opinion the brawling mechanics are good enough to justify the game being mostly just that - brawling.\nEven if you don't find it completely enjoyable, it's just too weird and unique of a game not to play through to see what it's like.","October 7, 2011","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are a few problems (the arenas are too closed - maube they should be bigger, with more space to maneuver -, the stamina is too short), but, in general, this is one of the very few 3d brawlers (like Die Hard Arcade and God Hand) that really capture that "impact feel" you get playing games 2d brawlers like Streets of Rage 2, Denjin Makai, Sengoku 3 and other classics. When you give a punch in this game, you can really feel it.

What Mirror's Edge did for running and jumping Zeno Clash does for punching people in the face.  Instead of the usual fixed camera and gimpy limbs, everything is properly weighted and moves naturally, so when you grab someone by the shoulders and give them a knee to the sternum, for once it truly feels right.  The bizarre and surreal style, setting and design of everything only makes it that much better.

Imaginative setting that somehow manages to give the impression that you've only just scratched the surface of the world of Zenozoik (and beyond) along with its eerily disturbing and eccentric characters result in a unique experience overall. That's not to say everything deserves praise though, especially in the mechanics department. First-person melee combat is awkward especially with its overreliance on somewhat stubborn focus mode that takes some time getting used to in order to avoid frustration. Not to mention how short the game is, probably as a result of obviously being ACE Team's first effort and consequence their choice to go for a surreal one-time experience.","March 11, 2013","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Visceral first-person melee mechanics make combat very unique and engaging. Nightmarish character design and creepy voicework contributes highly to the game's fascinatingly surreal ambience.\n\nCons: The small levels and strict linearity in progression are disappointing since the world's imaginative environments would be a blast to explore. Also, gamplay can feel repetitive at times since other than dialogue, there is little to break up the consecutive bouts of combat. Some elements of adventuring and exploration would add much to the experience. The game is a bit on the short side with the main story clocking in at about 4-5 hours.\n\nOverall, Zeno Clash is well worth playing and is an experience that is sure to stick with you.

The story and characters in this game are just as bizarre and fantastical as the setting.\nAlthough you can beat the campaign in about 4 hours, I would still highly recomend this game.

The story of this game is so damn trippy you will need to buy this game yourself to experiance its awesomely weirdness. The best part about Zeno Clash is its combat system. It is a beat em up but in first person. You can do a variety of punches ranging from jabs to HOLY ♥♥♥♥ YOU JUST MADE THAT GUY FLY ACROSS THE SCREEN. When you successfully pull off harder punches you get a sastifying crunch as you see your enemies face turn into jelly. There are also some guns in the game which are really awkward and are no where near as sastifying to use.

I picked up Zeno Clash 2 during the 2014 Steam Summer sale, so I figured I'd play through the original again. It really holds up well, considering its age (I may be biased with Source games though). The story is a nice taste in the wonderfully surreal land of Zenozoik. The full course arrives in the sequel.\n\nYou'll likely hear a complaint or two about the voice acting, but considering the indie development, it's pretty amazing. Plus, once you get immersed in the story, the strangeness of it becomes very appropriate.

The combat is fairly unique too, being a first person beat-em-up, and at times it can feel delayed and clunky, and with some of the weapons you're given, almost useless, but it is overall an interesting first step in a world and genre that has previously not existed. Although fairly linear, the world is still expansive, and although many enemies are recycled, you still feel a large variation in what you're fighting.

Various items are at your disposal, such as unlikely firearms, 'skullbombs' and health pickups.\n\nAn example of how fights play out: http://youtu.be/hFaRFfg5egs\n\nThe art style is absolutely crazy, the city of Halstedom being a prime example: A chaotic mishmash of various structures that all seem to be made out of different materials.

The story is a nice taste in the wonderfully surreal land of Zenozoik. The full course arrives in the sequel.\n\nYou'll likely hear a complaint or two about the voice acting, but considering the indie development, it's pretty amazing.

Having no expectations for the game or no prior knowledge about the game I was presently surprised by what this game had to offer. The story of this game is so damn trippy you will need to buy this game yourself to experiance its awesomely weirdness. The best part about Zeno Clash is its combat system. It is a beat em up but in first person. You can do a variety of punches ranging from jabs to HOLY ♥♥♥♥ YOU JUST MADE THAT GUY FLY ACROSS THE SCREEN. When you successfully pull off harder punches you get a sastifying crunch as you see your enemies face turn into jelly. There are also some guns in the game which are really awkward and are no where near as sastifying to use.

One of Zeno Clash' many prespectives is precisely to put this into practice. That game is one of a kind with its very peculiar visuals and themes, it's crazy mind-shattering story-line and its arsh and crude fight sequences. You'll at times and alternatively (or simultaneously in any kind of combinations!) feel confused, lost, amazed, overwhelmed, overjoyed, amused, loathed .. but no you've not been hit by a train and you're not dead & dreaming, you've just experienced ZENO CLASH!

Apart from the obvious "wtf" aspect of the art style (contestant for the best use of Source 2date imo) & the bizarre characters & story, this game has a hand 2 hand combat system that can put 3A titles to shame. While ranged and melee weapons are present the heart of the combat lies in good ol' fist fights, where you have to be thinking on your feet in order to survive. It is amazing how they've managed to make each part of the h2h combat system tacticaly valid, esp block/evade where usualy one option tends to overshadow the other. Hits also have some "weight" to them as opponents will react accordingly to each thumping blow.  Another + is the iclusion of a tower mode where you'll be focusing solely on the combat. Only drawback is the game's length: approx 5 hrs for the sp story. All in all one of the most unique games out there.

"Weird" is definitely the best adjective to describe it.  It's an odd game with odd characters in an odd world.  The game is made in the Source Engine, but the visuals are strikingly different from other games from the same engine, like Half Life 2 or Vampire: The Masquerade.  The game is a string of arcade-esque fights with guns and fists, all in first-person.  Zeno Clash is actually one of the only games to do fist fighting correctly in first person, and it does it well.  While Zeno Clash is very short, the story clocking only three to four hours, it does have a challange mode and varying difficulty levels.

I was always intrigued by how this game looked but never got the chance to get my hands on a copy ( until humble bundle :) ) . Ok so let's dwelve into the game. I finished the game on hard difficulty (which is pretty much normal difficulty) in about 3 hours and I can genuinely say I had fun. I wasn't the best of indie games in my oppinion but it was unique. I did find the weapons a bit overpowered though. The story was interesting , yet predictable (though i really liked the way it was narated , with memories and stuff) . The graphics are more than decent considering it's an almost 5 year old indie game . The sound track it's ok I guess but the voices of the characters are annoying sometimes (especially the girl that follows you).\n\nBut this game is about the gameplay which is really fun. I haven't played a good fighting game like this since God Hand. I am not a big fan of first person for most of the games , but here it was very enjoyable and it helped immerse the player into the game world. The game world is unique with all types of creatures and weird inhabitants .The combat is fast and you actually have to think your battles a little ahead but sometimes you can exploit ranged weapons(especially fighting "The Hunter").\n\nOverall a good game and I would recommend it , but I would wait for a sale if  I were you , since they are quite often (you might get zeno clash + zeno clash 2 for the price of one)\n","December 18, 2013","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The absurdistic world that you venture through never ceased to surprise me, and is at times strangely familiar. The music in Zenoclash is as weird as everything else in this game, and really seals the atmosphere. The voice acting sounds a bit shoddy though, although that might be intentional. I'm not really sure if it's a good or a bad thing, but I suppose it's another small contributor to the strangest, most bizare atmosphere you will ever encounter in a computergame. The game offers a unique experience to the player. The game may be a bit short, (you can probably finish the game in about 5 hours or so) but after finishing the storyline, you can also give the "tower challenges" a try. The tower challenges are basically a sort of gauntlet in which you fight against all the enemies which you have encountered during the storyline. I would give this game 78/100.","January 31, 2012","true","16.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The melee combat in this game is top notch for an fps game, the story line is weird and entertaining, the level design is gritty, dark, and imaginative and the only downside is linear gameplay. Im hoping the sequel will get rid of that dilemna.  7.7/10","January 16, 2012","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/caleblives/recommended/22200/","caleblives","Lead Shacks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/caleblives/","255 products in account","Zeno Clash is a fantastic first person fighter in a truly oddball setting. In Zeno Clash, you play as Ghat, one human in a tribe of varying races raised by the asexual creature "father mother". After attacking Father Mother, you and your surprisingly loyal "beetle antlers-in hair" girlfriend Deadra, have to fight to survive after Father Mother's children come after you.\nIt's a simple story, and Zeno Clash is a odd game in a strange, strange world populated by animal hybrid creatures, odd weapons made out of animal bones and beautiful scenery straight out of an acid trip.\nDespite all of that oddity though, the game itself is rather easy to get your head around. It's a first person fighter based around punches, kicks, combos, timing and defensive tactics over super moves or memorizing long combos. You will occasionally find weapons which you can use ranging from giant bone swords. to dual fish pistols. to even a really cool rifle made of bone and animal parts. You can use these pretty much for the entirety of a fight as they have infinite ammo (Unlike in Zeno Clash 2), but despite the occasional mandatory weapon section that betrays the game's source engine roots, Zeno Clash is still very much a first person brawler. The combat feels straight up visceral and impactful with just about every swing, block or throw you make. At times it feels a tad sluggish,\nThe combat is fun, but my favorite element of the (admittedly linear) game is exploring this absolutely crazy world. What's interesting about Zeno Clash's setting is that it doesn't seem to be just contrived of an acid trip, genuine world building has been done here and it shows. Areas range from market towns full of thieves to outlands full of sky high elephant-giraffe-anteater-things, to a few areas I would actually rather not spoil, but every one feels fleshed out and varied.\n\nDid I mention the game is gorgeous by the way, even now? Colors seem to fade, merge and pop in a way only water color paintings can. This game has some of the prettiest skyboxes I've ever seen, especially for a source game. Overall, the art design is rather excellent. Just about every character, weapon, and creature feels perfectly in line with game's oddball style.\n\nIt is the first game by an indie studio, so it's not without its rough spots. The voice actor for Deadra isn't all that great, small parts of the combat like recoveries feel a little sluggish, and the limitations of the source engine occasionally crop up, like rather small levels and loading screens halfway through areas. The fish pistols have this odd bug that still has yet to be fixed where the bottom row of bullet indicators is cut in half on the interface. The FOV is non-adjustable, although this is probably to add to immersion and because it changes mid-game actually mid combat. (This is a game where you can see your own feet, it is aiming for immersion.)\n\nOverall, Recommendation: If you even think you might like this, buy it. It's cheap at $10 and is well worth your time to at least play through the campaign once. If you are unsure, wishlist it and wait for a sale, as it usually drops down really, really low in price.\nIf you are wondering about cost to time spent ratio, the campaign is about 4+ hours long, but there's tons to go back and see. There's also a Challenge tower that I didn't bother too much with but you may find intriguing.","May 16, 2015","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Hilarious, surreal, tedious, deep, WTF.\nOver all I enjoyed this enjoyed playing it. The story was what drove me to slug through the combat which got a bit boring at times. Get it on sale. It doesn’t overstay its welcome and is just a nice short experience.","April 20, 2015","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
