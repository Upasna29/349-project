Unfortunately there isn't a lot more than that. There is one unfinished baseball area that looks very poor and that's all. The price is way too high for the content even for an early access game. I like the idea and I hope it will become a good game at some point in the future.","May 6","false","0.1"," 35 of 38 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","35","38","3","0"

The bowling game is not even similar to a real bowling experience as you bowl 3 rounds with 3 balls and no score is kept.  Just abysmal.\n\nThe baseball game is very inaccurate and for some reason they give you a bat in both hands rather than designating one.  Furthermore, actually attempting to make contact with the ball is a far greater challenge than attempting to find a positive in the only other experience available at such time with this game; the lackluster and worthless bowling experience.\n\nJust stay away from purchase as this is not even a complete demo at this point.  I wish there were some way to get a refund for such a steep price for a nearly worthless expenditure of your time and money.\n\n","May 6","false","0.1"," 26 of 32 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","26","32","3","2"

Feels like a quite unfinished demo. Bats (2?) dont work for the baseball game (?) well and bowling only sorta works.

However in it's current state it's not even close to being worth the entry price. Refunding...","May 8","false","0.1"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","1"
