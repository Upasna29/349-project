The story is somewhat reminiscent of Mario looking for the princess but the action is different.  There is far more intrigue to be found in the messages along the way than you ever experienced in Mario.  There is also a "Link-like" flavor for those that remember that classic.  Really when you think about it, this game is a conglomeration of a lot of the favorites from the past.\n\nIf you only play the game an hour or so, you can hardly even begin to experience the intense battles that ensue; as with almost any game, the first few levels are easy so that you can get accustomed to the game play (or maybe that is just to make you feel like "you can do this!").  Of course, if you are someone that doesn't like a challenge, you will be put off by having to back track when you come to a level unprepared.  This facet of the game reminds me a lot of Link...if you were not ready to go to a certain part (or land) of the game, no way were you getting in.  Had to go back and get what you needed!  Just thought about Boy and His Blob!  That's the way it is with this game.\n\nOf course, any serious gamer wants to experience hours and hours of entertainment, frustrating moments (trying to get through all the laser beams or going back to get bombs because you blew up too many needlessly), intrigue and bewilderment (exactly how do I get out of here???? moments).  Definitely a game worth your time.  Thumbs up!","December 6, 2015","true","15.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Each level has a pattern to it, discerning this is the key to sucess. Various upgrades for bob are available too which add to the enjoyment and really make it worth collecting everything on the levels instead of racing to the end.\nThe game also has a brilliant soundtrack to accompany it.","December 6, 2015","true","0.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Looking at it you may think it's a childs game by the cute graphics.. however it is far from it, the game gets to be tough as nails and will challenge even shmup vets.\n\nI've only played for a bit under an hour and am hooked. Here are a few pros and cons, I will update my thoughts as I play more.\n\nPros\n☆ In depth upgrade system, lots of options for customizing your play style\n☆ Hats! haha but seriously it is pretty cool the amount of chacter customization available.\n☆ Tight, responsive, simple controls\n☆ Pretty crazy shmup action\n\nCons\n☆ No native controller support that I've found. This is a great game for big picture mode (although it is easy to bind the actions with a steam controller)\n☆ Sometimes upgrade notifications, ect. will get in the way of seeing enemy projectiles.\n☆ Enemy projectiles aren't pronounced enough sometimes causing me to get hit.. however that could just be me.\n\nOther thoughts\n☆ The game starts out a bit too easy, I didn't even begin to feel a challenge until around level 8\n☆ The large crosshairs around all the npc's in the starting area is a bit annoying, would love it if they went away after you talked to them once.","December 6, 2015","true","0.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

I've played this a lot on Desura and I'm glad it's on Steam now!\n\nIt's a fun SHMUP game with a ton stuff to do and unlock. It's well worth that tiny price for the amount of content. I definitely recommend it if the video and screenshots look interesting to you!\n\nNow to get back to those achievements...","December 7, 2015","true","14.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/XRPMisterUltimate/recommended/391960/","XRPMisterUltimate","[XRP]MisterUltimate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/XRPMisterUltimate/","360 products in account","I played this game for hours on end when it was released on Desura, and I'm glad to finally see it here on Steam. To see what this game is all about, you can check out my Let's Play of it where I show a few early levels, the first mini-boss, and first boss.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=572980283\nThis is probably the most deceptively simple games I've played in a while. It looks so cute, and it has happy music, and you're a little orbit that shoots sugar berries, and everything is kittens and rainbows... until it decides to bring the pain!\n\nThe controls are simple. Move with WASD, and shoot with the arrow keys. Early on it's quite easy to out range most enemies, with most damage coming from rushing in. As you progress, enemies move in a more erratic pattern, requiring more timing and decisive movements to avoid taking too many hits. Even the most insane levels, where at first glance it seems every pixel contains death, have a pattern, and there are often multiple ways to go about clearing rooms.\n\nTo make life a little easier, there are multiple power-ups you can purchase with the coins and scrap you find through out the levels.  These increase your life, the range or speed of your shots, movement speed, etc. Some have down-sides attached, but unlike other power-ups, these can be unequipped.\n\nA quick tip: There are bombs scattered through out the game. These are normally for clearing the path to treasure chests or door, but can also be used to defeat enemies because each explosion send out debris in eight directions. By the time you actually need to clear some rocks, you'll have several available, and by the time the enemies start piling up, you'll have several dozen. So don't be shy about using a few to clear a difficult cluster of enemies.\n\nThere is a lot of fun to be had here. Lot's of crazy power-ups and other unlockables, a huge variety of enemies, great pixel graphics, and a kickin' 8-Bit soundtrack. Plus there are fun tongue in cheek characters all over Highworld, like Mega Dan, Floatus Wisedomus, and Phezz Fish. I will admit that casual gamers will most likely not enjoy Super Mega Bob. Alternatively, I definitely recommend this for anyone who enjoys retro-style games, shmups, challenging gameplay.","December 10, 2015","true","10.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/waryore/recommended/391960/","waryore","WarYore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/waryore/","2823 products in account","tl:dr  --  Get this if you like retro puzzle platformers, even though it's not a platformer.\n\nMechanically, Super Mega Bob is a Twin Stick Shooter.  You move with WASD and fire with the arrows.  But classifying games by mechanics alone, (as Extra Credits on YouTube likes to point out) is a poor choice of attributes to focus on.  Don't come to Super Mega Bob expecting anything like Geography Wars.  As the initials and choice of adjectives of the game name imply, SMB has more in common with retro puzzle platformers than most twin stick shooters.  And that is a very good thing.\n\nYes, as the difficulty increases, there are some very bullet-hell like levels.  But the art style - the colorful, fun, pixel-art sprites - the collecting coins and berries, the motivation of the lost love...  It's all very familiar and welcoming.  And it's all very NES.  It's great!\n\nThere are some RPG elements too, the collectables are not just for completionists (although a handy chart per level does help those completionists know what they've missed) - you can buy upgrades.  And you will need them.\n\nLike many retro platformers, there is a difficulty level here that requires work and patience to master.  Don't take the kid-friendly appearance to mean this is going to be easy.  It's not.\n\nIf you like retro games, if you like platformers, if you like a challenge -- get Super Mega Bob, you'll be glad you did!!!","December 18, 2015","true","2.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's quite different from most of the stuff thats out there. It's like a shmup but with multiple hub worlds. Sounds weird but if youre into shooting stuff, timing, upgrades, and shumps in general give this one a shot. Just give it some time.","March 18","true","5.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Having a mouse cursor which is moved by arrows really takes you out of the platforming experience and slows everything down!\n\n2.) It would have been better with diagonal firing, since the enemies can!  It has the feel of a dated platformer, NOT in a good way.\n\n3.) There are things that are are counter intuitive, such as the fractions of resources are inversed!  Basic math here, which makes the game not only look bad, but the player has to think backwards.\n\nIt is actually a bit tedious and boring with little challenge.  I find myself getting hit only out of laziness, since you can sit back at range most of the time.\n\nI am just not compelled to complete the game (160 levels), with so many other more enjoyable titles in my library and on Steam.\n","May 19","false","0.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Maybe as Super Mega Bob continues it begins to unravel into an epic tale of love and loss with excellent mechanics and level design. Maybe it's a clever twist on the genre that you only find out several hours in (like Spec Ops: The Line). But if somebody who's almost professionally obliged to give the game at least an hour or so of play can't face anymore after about forty minutes you're doing something wrong.\n\nThe opening cutscene is a sweet if generic tale of some idealised world torn apart by some kind of explosion. You (as Bob) with your new pair of hands set out to find your best friend and lover. There's a lot of story strewn throughout the levels which you can find but again it's mostly fairly generic and uninteresting.\n\nThe game play has you floating around a world either killing 'x' enemies or collecting 'x' coins before reaching the end of the level. Enemies mostly ignore your existence and are more like obstacles to avoid and with the added time slow avoiding their bullets is easy. Not only this but almost immediately I found that my range far exceeded any opponents so I could easily sit back without risk. The game is shaken up a bit with the bosses and mini-bosses and these present the main challenge in the game, despite this they don't really add much only needing to avoid more difficult bullet waves and taking more damage.\n\nThe game seems to have a fairly in-depth upgrade system which is almost completely unneeded. You can both craft and get upgrades as drops which are mostly fractional upgrades to your speed, attack and range. However these RPG like upgrades just don't match the platformer but not really style of the game. The sound design also swaps between being boring and outright annoying. Many of the sound effects are ear splitting and the music tinny and annoying such that I turned off the sound after only a few levels.\n\nThe real moment that made me quit out was when I reached a room where I needed a bomb to reach the end of the level. However I had no bombs on me nor were any present in the room. In order to clear it I'd need to back track to a previous level pick one up. This kind of backtracking was simply something I wasn't prepared to do and probably means that there is more of it further in the game.\n\nSuper Mega Bob feels like someone's first project, and maybe it is! But if that's the case this game belongs on sites like congregate for free not on steam even for the relatively low price of just over £3.\n","December 5, 2015","false","3.4"," 2 of 13 people (15%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","15","2","13","0","1"
