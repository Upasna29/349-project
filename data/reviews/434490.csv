Proper bubbling bile, frothing in the pit of my gut that demands I throw the pad as hard as I can into my monitor in a petulant temper tantrum. The stories I could tell, the deaths I could recount, the fury I could bottle – and all of it particularly difficult to pin on the game. That makes it my fault. This makes me angrier still.\n\nOtem is largely a twitch-based game that traps you in a number of circular arenas and then casually tries to kill you. It often succeeds. Your job, as a tribal sacrifice not all that keen on the sacrificial aspect of your career, is to run around the arena’s various floors collecting power spheres to then fire at the weak spots on a revolving totem that dominates the centre. Only, it’s not best pleased at your attempts to do so. You’re a blood tribute, and your only role is to die.\n\nFull Review // http://www.honestgamers.com/12963/pc/otems-defiance/review.html","April 29","true","6.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","1"

Got me cursing and retrying the same level tons of times, but also thrilled when I managed to dodge a volley of bullets at just 1 HP, double jump and hit that damn Ringod in its bullseye-thingy.\n\nExtra props for the great OST, the charming visuals and the cool comic-like cutscenes.","May 14","true","20.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chiguireliterario/recommended/434490/","chiguireliterario","Chigüire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chiguireliterario/","217 products in account","Otem's Defiance follows the formula of a good platformer: tight controls, lots of things happening at the same time, and the harrowing feeling that one of the things that happen will kill you eventually. This is all condensed in one circular set, where enemies throw you things and you throw things back.\n\nThe game starts easy but the variety of enemies quickly adds up and you start wondering how the heck are you going to evade the fireballs that are firing somewhere else. The final boss of the first tier gave me a lot of work, and it looks a lot like old school bosses and their exact patterns of movement.\n\nThis is also a game I see with a potential community of speedrunners.","May 2","true","1.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

And I actually got involved with the story background of the game, quite a lot more than expected (nostalgia bonus, the intro actually took me to OoT, and that's a major thing to be compared to). I've put a few hours into the game just to find out what happen with Otem and the village and the EFFING gods. Le gf and I play it, and we almost kill each other about each kill, each mistake XD 10/10 perfect couple therapy.\n\nAnd actually got in contact with the developers, fast to respond and faster to fix and update the game. Really cool people behind this tittle. Not at all what I was expecting, but so, so much more.","April 25","true","14.0"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","1"

It's a hardcore old-school inspired arcade style game. The art and music are absolutely stunning and it's extremely hard. Not frustrating hard but "One last try!"-hard, and man, it's so much FUN. The story is pretty engaging as well, some very interesting inflexions and symbolism on society and human behavior. Can't believe this came from such a small team of developers.\n\nDefinitely give it a chance, I give it a glowing 5 stars, see if you can beat the first boss.","April 25","true","2.1"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

It plays well and the idea of battling gods can be appealing. Also, the music and the story strips are of excelent quality. The game, however, gets repettitive pretty quickly. Mechanics take a long time to appear (like the double jump) and fighting the same battles over and over with no new skills, gets annoying very fast. It feels a little rushed and it makes it hard for you to keep interested in the game. The animation quality is also not to par with the incredible cutscenes, and the story feels like it overstay its welcome by being too long. All in all i think this is a pretty impresive first attempt by a small indie studio, and that deserves praise. Moreover, i strongly believe that, with some polish, this could be an awesome product.","May 17","true","1.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
