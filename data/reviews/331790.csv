"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Keldien/recommended/331790/","Keldien","Keldien <TWM>","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Keldien/","764 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nPlease note that this is an early access/beta review.\n\nReboot is already a marked improvement over the previous games of the series, while still retaining both the story and customization charm.\n\nThe story picks up with a new character, and you are shown the aftermath of Corruption's finale through a fresh perspective.  It is still useful to have played the previous games, but does not seem entirely necessary - at this point, there is no save import feature to reward those that have completed the saga up 'til now.\n\nThe combat is, visually and mechanically, improved over the previous games.  It is smoother, more detailed, and less prone to crazy RNG.  In the previous games, having a gunner in your party was very nearly a sure-win against most bosses, due to the insane critical rates allowed; thus far, I have yet to run into any equivalently overpowered build.\n\nThere are a myriad of classes, branching out from a base class - the Novice.  Each class is divided by Grade (general level of power) and specialization (Magic, Psychic, Physical).  Characters can advance along any path, picking and choosing classes to level as they go.  Characters have an overall level that dictates their general stats, and a class level that dictates their abilities gained, stats gained, and a few other bonuses.  Leveling lower grade classes, like the Fighter, unlocks higher end classes like the Knight.  Abilities gained from these classes remain with the character regardless of which class they are currently leveling - thusly you could be a psychic focused character that is listed as a Knight and is learning Knight skills.\n\nAll of the above give a great amount of customization to the party.\n\nThe audio in the game is also vastly improved from the previous Data Hacker games.  Combat music is far more fitting of the setting, and ambient music is much more pleasant than previous games.\n\nIt is an early access game, however, and is not without issues.\n\nCrashes are not common, but do happen and can rob you of quite a significant chunk of time if you are not a compulsive saver.  Getting stuck is also not uncommon - thankfully, this is easily remedied by recalling out of an area and re-entering it, but it still wastes a bit of time.\n\nThere is also a large disparity in difficulty between the zones available to you at the start of the game.  Going north from town into the forest will set you against creatures that give a moderate-to-good amount of experience and hit your characters in the range of 10% of their hit points while on-level; meanwhile, the other zones you have access to might have creatures that hit all of your characters for half of their hit points every turn.  Without knowing where not to go ahead of time, it can be a bit dicey.\n\nAll of that said, I highly recommend the game.  The pros far outweigh the cons, to me at least, and I feel that many of the issues are things that can and will be addressed, as the developer is very quick to respond to issues on the forum and take steps to adjust things as requested.","March 15, 2015","true","26.9"," 26 of 36 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","26","36","2","0"

The combat is straight forward and has an interesting class mechanic, allowing the characters to specialise into battle roles chosen by the player. The overall presentation is very slick. Visuals are great, music is memorable, and the voiceover of characters during battle is a great addition. Since this is an Early Access, there are still a few issues being ironed out, but otherwise the game is turning out really well and delivers lots of fun.","February 16, 2015","true","7.0"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","14","21","2","0"

Great game, nice sound track, a good continuation of the storyline where you can jump right into without having to play the previous 2 games (Though I highly recommend that you do play them) with a good cast of characters. It is class based and to unlock higher quality, and more specialised versions of that class all you need to do is level it up until it unlocks plus the option to use skills from any class that character has previously learnt. You have a smooth transition between areas, no feeling too weak when entering a new area after finishing a previous one plus if you think the encounter rate is too high then you can get an item from a merchant in the main city that can reduce the rate by 50% or even by 100%.\n\nAnother plus is that if you find an issue and let them know about it, they will actually do something about it and are quite quick to respond and if you think of something that you think is needed or could help improve the game then they will listen (Like with the encounter rate item I mentioned)\n\nI can't tell you enough how much I enjoy this game and the series as a whole it is great, 11/10 xD\n\n\nEarly Access Review:\n\n5 hours of play time so far and I have found it a great game to play, Has some issues but it is still in early access so these are being worked on (In my experiance I have only encountered one bug where I couldn't move after opening a chest in a dungeon). Continuation of a good storyline with improved visuals and sound track. Has been good for the short about of time I have played and with the updates is getting better all the time, well worth the price.","February 28, 2015","true","29.0"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","9","13","2","1"

I enjoyed playing it so I figured I would give it a decent review.\n\n\nWhile I do recommend the game, I will start with the games short comings first.\nCons:\n\nBuggy - Their are definitely bugs in the game. The game is not as polished as it could but, but thats not from a lack of trying (Read Pros later) This is probably the games biggest fault, and that unfortunately has scared alot of people away from the game.\n\nVague - The game does not hold your hand, you are dumped into a world, and your expected to figure things out on your own, their is very little in the ways of tutorials for alot of the game features.  And their are actually alot of features.\n\nUnderdeveloped - It seems their could be alot more added.\n\n\nPros:\n\nUnique: Between the three games in the Data Hacker series, a unique world, with a decent amount of story and logic put into its creation. While many parallels could be made between this and a couple other story ideas out there, their is enough in the story and plot of the entire series that sets this apart.\n\nImprovements: Writing, and Characters, have all noticbly improved since the first game. The character you get are decentlly interesting, fairly unique, and if you have played the other two games in the series, I do believe that things are heading in an upward direction.\n\nInvested Developer: The Developer has been fairly active on the Discussion Boards, and has dialogued back and forth with almost every comment.\n\nPotential: This game would really shine, if and when it gets just a little bit more polish.\n\n\nOverall Opinion:\n\nThe game was worth the Price of $5 Having gotten 30+ hours out of something that cost me less than eating at a Fast Food resturant. I'm pretty sure most $8 meals have not given me 30 hours of enjoyment. So at its regular price I think its a good deal.\n\nOverall what I would like to see in the future is simply More. More Polish, More Content, More Character Development, More Side Quests, More Character related side quests. (okay, their might not be a need for More classes, the game already has a done, but definitely more development to make them all unique.) I definitely look forward to more content, maybe a DLC, or even a Squel to continue to story.\n\n","December 28, 2015","true","32.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Might just be me but I did have to level grind a lot after the first part and have only encountered one bug with the skeleton man.\n\nThe game is a must have and worth the early access fee as it will give you the full game once it comes out.

However, although the title is Data Hacker, it doesn't mean that you'll be a hacker; this game only has a Data Hacking skill, which is used for battle and unique for each person. Despite all that, i would have to point out first that this game lags a lot (i even lag on the splash screen), making a battle which can be finished in less than 1 min to be finished in more than 2 mins (i even can multitask the battle with reading webtoons).\n\nStorySome people might notice that there are other Data Hacker titles made by the same developer. I myself haven't play the other series and i could say that you can mostly understand what's happening without playing the others (if those are connected, although i doubt it). The story itself is quite straightforward; a man who is looking for his lost sister just to find out that her sister is going for trouble. I have to admit that the story doesn't really captivate me that much which made me almost forgotten about the story after playing it for a few days.\n\nCharacter development in this game mostly only focused on the MC and only switched to another one (Damasc) once, and that's only near the end. However, the devs are trying to made that up by giving nonsensible cutscenes for some characters by using a certain item.\n\nMusicTo be honest, the music in this game is decent. The music plays well with the environment and it's not boring. However, because this game mostly focused on grinding, you'll mostly hear battle scenes, and i have to say that the character voices are annoying. They are very loud compared to the bgm and they keep on repeating the same thing over and over. I wish i could find the mute button, but after muting about 2 out of 3 music options just to find that it's useless, i'd rather to mute my computer sound when playing the game.\n\nGraphicsAlthough the graphics in this game is decent for a RPG Maker game, most of them are custom-made graphics, which is quite a feat. However, the battle graphics are not appealing enough for me. The UI itself is great and blend well with the title, and i like that.\n\nBattleThis game requires grinding. A lot. In my first 4 hours playing this game, i spent it just for grinding in the same area for levels because the next area is way too strong for me to beat. Well, i have to admit that it's my fault for not noticing where to go, because i ended up knowing that i should go to other places instead. However, this also proves that the game has a lack of information on the main quest, and the difficult side quest needs to be limited based on main quest progress.\n\nThe battle portion in this game is quite insane. Although i said that this game is mostly about grinding, don't expect that it'll be that simple. All opponents won't die by a simple attack; you'll need to use several skills which will consume either TP or MP based on the skills. Also, in an optional area (Desert Mall), the normal monsters are as strong as boss monsters.\n\nThe greatest part of this game is its class system. There are a lot of classes to pick up, and you're not bound to be just one type. Meaning, you can choose and level tons of classes based on your need while keeping each skills at your disposal. Some characters also have unique class, which makes it more interesting.\n\nThe other amazing thing in the class system is the "class advancement". After reaching a certain level of a class, you'll unlock other classes which has a more level cap and skills to learn.\n\nThere are 8 playable characters in this game. However, you can only keep 3 as active party member and every party member which joins you will start at level 1 which either means useless or more grinding depends on whether you want to use him/her/it or not. All characters have their own unique skills and weapons. However, because of the game mechanic which only let the active party member to earn exps, most of the characters end up being useless.\n\nThere are two types of encounters; random and the non-random one. There is an item to prevent random encounters, although it won't stop the non-random one. You can also flee in battles, although you'll mostly won't be able to escape the non-random one because after you flee, you'll just "touch" them again and initiate the battle (there is almost no invicibility frame after fleeing the battle).\n\nMapsThere are tons of dungeon in this game and they are designed very well. If not for the annoying battle system, i would enjoy them very much.\n\nHowever, the collision in this game is terrible. I myself have found a lot of collision bug, especially in O' Sola (last dungeon/world). In addition, i have to deal with annoying moving platforms which is hard to get out to in the first world (Organis).\n\nMinigamesThere are 2 minigames in this game. Card and Space Shooter clone. Although i am enjoying the card game a lot, i have to say that the space shooter one is trash. It lacks objective and you can accidentally close it like nothing happened.\n\nPros:\n- Extensive class system\n- 8 playable characters with their own weapon and unique skills (some has unique class).\n- Classes aren't forced to the characters (choose your own class!)\n- Tons of content\n- Card minigame\n- Crafting system\n\nCons:\n- Lags a lot (even at the splash screen)\n- Long and tedious battle\n- Grinding\n- Random encounter rate are way too high in the last few worlds\n- There's almost no invicibility frame after fleeing a battle\n- Tons of collision errors\n- Annoying voice sounds in battle\n\nConclusionAlthough this game has a lot of content and features, the time consuming battles, grinding, and lags made it loses its charm.\n\nShould you buy this game?No.\nThat is, unless you somehow can play this game without lag.\nEven if you can play this game without lag, you have to like grinding and time consuming battles a lot.","May 22","false","49.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I fought for a million times, got something from it like xp and some items. For the first time this was really exciting -- as I said, for the first time. This was like 5 minutes. I played 40 minutes overall, don't think I am gonna play any more about it. Back to the thread -- It went downstairs from exciting. Every second step, I dropped into a fight. This made it boring, and even annoying. But, I continued searching along because I saw the story exciting. For now, I don't even have any clue about what I have to do.

However after seeing my graphics glitch as i walk through objects, getting stuck in walls, jumping over a gap that is identical to the landmass i was standing on, and the game's seeming love of a grind, I have a hard time saying its enjoyable. Most of the time i spent in the game was grinding. Didn't feel like I went very far, and for quiet a bit of it there wasn't a good feeling of direction or need to go in a certain direction.\n\nThe class system is maybe a little too splintered because to an extent some classes could easily have shared abilities, especially when you can only have 3 characters fighting at a time. You also can't view a class ahead of time to see what exactly it does. Starting out i had no idea which class gained healing abilities. Its possibly my own ineptitude, but I had trouble finding out what the stats do. Strength probably has something to do with damage, but persona and fortune weren't spelled out very well.\n\nCurrency in the game is also a bare looking. After all my hours of grinding, I had less than 5000. I couldn't afford the land someone was selling in the town, buying armor for all of my characters would bankrupt me or possibly even be out of reach because the starting armor was just that much more expensive than what I'd made.\n\nLastly the story didn't really draw me in. The setting looks interesting, but the direction the game sent me was vague and I felt like i was being kicked into a dungeon instead out on an adventure. There was also a bit with a character with a time traveling booth that wasn't all that entertaining to me. I got the reference, but it just wasn't entertaining to me.","November 20, 2015","false","6.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","1"
