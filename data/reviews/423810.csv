The point of each one is to get as much treasure as possible. There are 4 characters now (at the start of Early Access) with a variety of colors to choose from. It's still in development but plays great and the visuals are fantastic!\n\nBasically how the game plays out is you play a minigame, but partway through it, you switch to another one. If you die in one minigame, you are out of that one but will still keep playing in the other ones. There will sometimes appear a really big treasure idol that's worth a ton so it's worth trying to get your hands on.\n\nYou can play Local, With Friends (this is how you can play with your buddies), and Online with other random people. The matches can be longer or quick but are usually around 5-10 minutes on average.\n\nOverall, a ton of fun and easy to get into! Also the devs are awesome and very quick to respond to questions about the game! I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great family friendly party game for all ages! 10/10","March 24","true","1.5"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","14","20","0","0"

Chaotic and whacky, definitely a party game. I would definitely recommend using a controller, though.","March 24","true","0.6"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","10","15","0","0"

Instead of playing each game through you have a set amount of game modes that you will randomly jump between (every 20-30 seconds or so). Progress is saved in each game mode so when you jump back to a previous one you will carry on from where you left off.\n\nAt first this mechanic was confusing and irritating, however I think it has potential to be fun. Either way I would be surprised if in future versions alternate game mdoes aren't available.\n\nSome of the issues include poor balancing in one game mode, limited game modes and limited diversity of game modes (all of them are about collecting coins).\n\nUsually these isues would not concern me in an early access however the Early Access FAQ says that it will only be in early access for “A few months max.” I expect we will see some balancing changes and maybe, at most twice as much content. The game, unfortunately, needs more work than this to reach its full potential.\n\nThat being said its still a reasonable game.\n","March 25","true","0.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Pick your character from two male or two female models but a wide assortment of colors allowing you to stand out from the rest as you struggle to be number one at the end. Collect as many coins, rubies and gems as you can without getting squished, burned, or blown up before time runs out to rain supreme above the competition.\n\nPros:\n\n-	A fun fast pace number of mini games that will keep you on your toes at all times\n-	A decent amount of variety that will keep every match uniquely different from one another no matter how many times you play.\n-	Beautiful cartoon graphics that get you in the mood to play and laugh with one another.\n-	Sounds and music that match the games and keep you coming back for more.\n\nCons:\n\n-	The keyboard controls are a bit hard to get used to and tend to be far less smooth then the controller counterpart, making for a bit of an unfair advantage to those with one.\n\nIn conclusion Marooners is a fun mini game all the family can enjoy as you pit friends and family against one another in a friendly and funny environment. 3.5  out of 5.\nAC-Gamer\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTyGAG_geVh5f3jjuS6cbS7lHmaoUnXzf\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P33PLIJHOVg&list=PLTyGAG_geVh5f3jjuS6cbS7lHmaoUnXzf&index=1\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUZDVa3h07g&list=PLTyGAG_geVh5f3jjuS6cbS7lHmaoUnXzf&index=2\n","March 27","true","0.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

A small instruction before each gamemode tells you all you need to know. After a short period of time the gamemode will switch, saving player positions and starting (or continuing) with another gamemode. About half a dozen different gamemodes per session will be played, picking up where you left off untill each mode is finished. The player with the most accumulated coins wins!\n\nOne gamemode will have you running on breaking ice while gusts of wind try push you into oblivion. Other times you will be dodging boulders while your friends throw bombs in your direction, or stealing a coin cannon from your friends.\n\nAll minigames are original games and have a fitting upbeat soundtrack.\n\nThere is already so much value in this Early Acces game, not to mention the realtime update countdown.\n\nThis game is definitely to be recommended!","April 12","true","1.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There isn't much to this game at the moment, as it's still in early access, so take that into consideration when reading this review.\n\nGameplayThis game is pretty much a bunch of party minigames mashed together to create a somewhat confusing and irritating the first few times you play through this. The mechanic of this game is rather unique for it's simplicity, but starting off with this it may seem a rather confusing jumble of minigames together. But after playing it a few times you start to understand what each minigame has to offer and what you actually have to do in order to win that minigame. The mechanic of this game works as follows, you are placed into a random minigame and off you go. You have about 25-30 seconds to try to get as many points on that minigame as you can until it goes to another minigame and you repeat the process. You will recycle through a few minigames, and be put back into the first minigame of where you where when you finished your first 30 seconds of the minigame. For the time being, the game lacks the amount of minigames that are avaialble but hopefully they will add more in future updates. The keyboard controls for local multiplayer aren't exactly the best, it was hard to play with another friend as it was rather cramped and hard to control. Needs the optition to change keyboard controls.\n\nPros+ Unique mechanic\n+ Local & Online Co-op\n+ Full controller support\n\nCons- Few minigames\n- No optition to change keyboard controls\n- At the moment no Achievements or Trading cards\n\nResult / Final thoughtsFor the time being, Marooners is a alright game, with a very unique and interesting mechanic. Although there isn't many minigames, the game does offer Local & Online multiplayer, along with full controller support. I feel like this game will be great in future updates, and when it eventually gets out of the Early Access stage.\n\nRating: 6.5/10 (EARLY ACCESS HANDICAP)\n\nFor more reviews on a wide range of games, go and follow ReviewExperts curator group here.","March 26","true","0.5"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"
