"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrito/recommended/420110/","cyrito","Cyrito_|D.VA|","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrito/","182 products in account","(Acutal Review BELOW)\nShowed my parent some gameplay.\n\nDad is proud of me. Mom is not letting me come closer to my little sisters and the cats anymore.\n\n10/10 - would make dad proud again.\n\nUPDATE: My dad increased my allowance after i patched the game.\n\n11/10 - would make mom love me again.\n\nEdit: Since most of you want an actual review, I'll give you one. I'm not a professional reviewer or anything, just a simple closet weeb :^)\n\nNekopara is a VN that sets apart other VN on steam, due to it's animation mostly. To me, Nekopara is a nukige because the plots are pretty decent, but the H-scene are what we are here for. So lets break it down part by part.\n\nCG/Graphic - This is what makes this game a bit different than other VNs. You don't see many VNs that animates the sprites during conversation, let you pet them and make their "coconuts" bounce. I also love the E-MOTES system in Nekopara. The backgrounds and the colours are really lively and heartwarming in a way. So it's a plus in my book.\n\nPlot - If you like the plot from Nekopara Vol. 1, you should be fine with this plot but it's a bit shorter. One thing I find lacking in Nekopara are the plot. I understand making a harem + ecchi plot can be difficult because there's a ALOT of VNs out there have the same genre with the same-kind plot. My kind of plot that is to my likings are the Clannad, Grisaia type of plot etc, where they have proper routes and different ending. I think Nekopara is the nukige kind of plot c: . Anyway, I'm pretty sure you guys bought it for the "plot" am I right??\n\nVoice/Music - I'm the type of person who will go on youtube and search "Anime OST that will make you cry" while reading his manga. Yes, I think OST/background songs plays an important role to VNs. This is because the purpose for OST is to make the VNs to be alive, make you want to be part of the story. And Nekopara OST are pretty good. Not gonna lie, I like some of the OST from this game. The voice actor are all great and lovely, if you play Imouto Paradise or any loli VNs, you should be okay with some of the high pitch voice (Some of my friends don't like high pitch loli voice lol)\n\nH-Scene - All scenes are fap-licious c: You got to thanks Neko Works for making this game and releasing the patch straight after the game launchs. Animated H-Scene are my kind of game, like Ultimate Boobs War. I know some of you will get the patch without paying, but if possible do continue to SUPPORT the content creator <3\n\nOverall -  I have no complains for this game. Just another VNs added to my collection. I enjoy the VNs especially the H-Scene :^)","February 19","true","38.4"," 2,025 of 2,294 people (88%) found this review helpful 2,233 people found this review funny","88","025","2","233","77"

Developed by NEKO WORKs  and published by Sekai Project. Please do note that the steam version is an all ages version the 18+ version can be bought on DLsite and if you bought the steam version the patch can be bought on Denpasoft. Links can be found below.\n\nThe storyAs for Nekopara vol.2 the 2 cat girls getting featured are Coconut and Azuki It is very lighthearted, well what I would say you will feel relaxed reading Nekopara for sure because that is what I felt, its fluffy  cute. I honestly was a little surprised in the direction of the story went. What I was expecting was the story to be something similar to Nekopara vol. 1 where almost everything seems perfect and jut a few obstacles here and there but vol. 2 is different there are topics of family being touched on and there are a few moments where it gave me a heart attack.\n\nAudio and Visual elementsVisual elements – CGs are detailed to go well with backgrounds and with the use of E-motes of sprites it makes them look very alive like as if real it is not like most of your static looking visual novels out there, breaking free from the static nature of many visual novels out there, and adding depth and motion to a scene to create a more dynamic emotional response from characters.\nhttps://youtu.be/JiyMsSHEzO8\n\nAudio elements – There is nothing really notable here for the soundtrack section but I loved the Ending song for it named [100nyan power de yumegokoti] what a cute song name.\n\nTo Sum UpWill I recommend this visual novel? Definitely yes, I really do not see a reason for missing this visual novel, it is lighthearted, cute and a great experience to read through it. If you do love cute cat girls doing cute things and adorable yet memorable characters do no give any of the Nekopara games a miss.\n\nDo not forget to press the P on the keyboard!

I surely took my time to read this, in fact, I used a bit over 15 hours to finish it where on Volume 1 I spent over 25 hours just for not finishing it on a single session.\n\nAs this novel is intended to be a eroge, I played it as patched version so I'm not sure how much shorter the "original Steam version" after all is. I would assume that the length of this novel is somewhere between 3-10 hours, depending on your reading style.\n\nThe artwork and usage of colours on this title are highly detailed and beautiful to see, the story continues its predecessor nicely and is emotional like on Volume 1.\nIt is really pleasant to read Nekopara thanks to almost continuously animated characters (E-Mote System) which bring the novel to a whole different level compared to the more usual "standstill picture" based visual novels.\nTranslation at least to English seems to be pretty fluent since I didn't notice even a single typo on text.\n\nI'm on pretty high spirits that we will see Volume 3 someday, hopefully for next year if the sales are going to go well. Which shouldn't be any major problem with this title, so I'm willing to wait whatever it takes to see the stories of last two catgirls of Minaduki family, Cinnamon & Maple - or whatever we might be seeing in the future? Only time will tell us.","February 21","true","21.1"," 84 of 93 people (90%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","90","84","93","10","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Honketh/recommended/420110/","Honketh","MightyHonk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Honketh/","227 products in account","If you're not familiar with context of the previous game, you will probably not be convinced that the opportunity to shag a Coconut is a good thing. However, you can jolly well believe it is.\n\nYou're probably coming here for a third time knowing pretty well what the goods are, but if by some accident you clicked on this store page and could not comprehend what is going on there, i am here to the rescue:\n\n1) Nekopara 2 is a sequel to award winning psychological thriller about a young man who eloped from his parents to open a bakery that costs at least several hundred grands by the look of it, and suddenly all of his antropomorphic cat pets with various chest size and his sister want his D, and no matter how much he resists, he has no option other than to give it. Apparently, in utopian society that's the pinnacle of existential crisis that you have to worry about.\n\n2) Nekopara is an eroge, which means that the gameplay consists of reading a story about fully voiced animated characters while music is playin and they're smiling and jiggling their breasts, to get emotionally attached to them, and then masturbate severely when the H scene hits. Yeah, that's about it.\n\n3) As ususal, steam version is half the price cut out with no sex, since volvo believes that community of steam will be traumatised for life after seeing a nipple, but developers offer uncesoring patch at their  website[denpasoft.com] for ten more bucks, so instead of buying on Steam it would make more sense to either buy full game from Dlsite or go full YARR on the patch, but i just woke up with hangover and what's done is done.\n\n4) Sayori needs more noodles to keep drawing, so buy this.\n\n5) It's a sequel, there was also fandisc "Nekopara vol 0" which has no h, so if youre looking to play full collection, you have to go in release order.\n\n6) Game comes with three languages: english and two kinds of eldrich runes of the time before mankind.\n\n7) They still offer achiviements for playing with them, encouraging you to think you know chinese.\n\n8) Chest bounciness slider goes from "heaviest matter in the universe" up to that scene in high school of the dead where girl accellerated her melons to 295 mph to dodge a bullet between them for no good reason.\n\n9) High production values with full voice acting, animation and upbeat fruity loops soundtrack.\n\n10) You can disable h-scene animations. Yeah, for some reason that's an option.\n\n11) Azuki apparently has a weak bladder, some people were probably excited to see this, i was not.\n\n12) After waxing your carrot you can go to Steam and write in  review  how your grandma deowned you after seeing you getting hard for a cartoon and sent you into exile on a boat with one round in old percussion revolver, but powder got wet and you couldn't even kill yourself, because that's really creative of you.\n\n13) You can diss h patch and play it for chill slice of live story, if you for some reason ashamed of sexual content.\n\n14) But for what purpose?\n\nSteam patch has this disclaimers, so i figure you'd like to know what you get with this new steam version patching thing:\n・Any screenshots taken during the 18+ scenes as well as the thumbnails for saves during the 18+ scenes will be blurred out or otherwise replaced with pictures of All Ages scenes.\n・The game will revert to the All Ages version when you stream.\n・When beginning a stream, the game will automatically return to the title screen.\n・While streaming, you cannot load save data from 18+ scenes.\n\nSo yeah, apparently a lot of people thought it would be a good idea to screenshot a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥s on Steam (not surprised tbh), so you have this. I don't know how it would work if someone decides to invite themselves into watching you while you already in a pickle of a hot man on  mutant-feline action, because i don't even have streaming enabled, but take note.\n\nOverall i give this game 100 horny pastry puffers out of 100 and encourage you to play this as soon as possible, but keep in mind that it's a work of fiction, so leave your little sisters and domestic animals alone.","February 20","true","0.8"," 71 of 81 people (88%) found this review helpful 42 people found this review funny","88","71","81","42","1"

He sets up on a small shop/apartment called La Soleli, sporting western-style flairs.\nWhile getting ready to unpack his boxes of cargo, he discovers two unfamiliar boxes in the open. He is then surprised to find out that Chocola (ショコラ) and Vanilla (バニラ), two of his family's nekos, followed him by stowing away in the boxes.\nAfter a lot of drama, Kashou decide to keep Chocola and Vanilla by his side and then later on makes the two of them, his maid employees at the shop and catpanions in the end.\nBut Chocola and Vanilla aren't the only catgirls in the Minaduki family. Chocola and Vanilla got four sisters, Azuki (アズキ) and Coconut (ココナツ) (which is the central characters in Vol.2) and Maple (メイプル) and Cinnamon (シナモン), you don't get to meet these four sister cats much in Vol.1, but you get to know them a lot better, in the Vol.0 fan prequel that was released last summer, but I can tell you, that these four sister catgirls still live home with Kashou's younger sister Shigure (時雨), which is the person, responsible for taking care of and educating and training the catgirls, so they can obtain their bells.\n\nCatgirls will need to obtain a bell (also known as Independent Action Permit) to become independent, meaning the catgirls can go to public places without their master/owner, it can be substituted in place of the catgirl's identification papers and also allows the catgirls to enter establishments and events even when pets aren't allowed.\nTo obtain a bell, they will need to learn to control their cat instincts and act like human beings to pass the hard examen.\n\nI think that should be the most important parts of the story in Vol.1 and plot in Nekopara in general, that you will need to know, to be able to continue with Vol.2.\n\n\nActual Vol.2 review:\nI was really surprised to find out how good Vol.2 turned out, it's actaully the best one yet, with that said that dosent make the other two episodes bad, Vol.2 is just the best of them all.\nIt just got everything, action, drama, happiness, emotional, romantic, cuteness, "incest" and you get so much closer to the other catgirls as well, so in my opinion, this is by far, one of the best VN's released on steam\nThe story is great and especially for an adult VN, they sometimes lack a little on the story part, but that's far from the case in Nekopara, it's a short but well written story.\n\nand for a great story, fit a great artstyle and the artstyle in Nekopara is incredible and is made by one of my favorite artists and the founder of Nekoworks: Sayori (さより), a really talented japanese lady, she is also known for "Muv-Luv Alternative Chronicles" and "Boku to Koi Suru Ponkotsu Akuma", she currently lives in Japan, but is born and raised in China (from what I know off)\n\nand like everything else, the audio and soundtracks are astounding as well and we got a couple of new once in Vol.2, I think that these are composed by Nao and Sakakibara Yui, there aren't much information about Nao, but Sakakibara Yui (榊原 ゆい), born October 13 1980, is a Japanese choreographer, dancer, singer, songwriter, and voice actress and those two did a great job on composing the soundtracks for Nekopara, you won't be able to get these soundtracks out of your head again, trust me, when I first read Nekopara, I was humming the soundtracks for atleast a week or two.\n\nThe two voice actors for Azuki and Coconut, did a great job on their voice acting as well, but that's no real surprise, the japanese always master their voice acting and it's usually always in a  really high quality, Mia Naruse (成瀬未亜) also known as Mio Nonose (野々瀬 ミオ) did the voice acting for Azuki and Tezuka Ryouko (手塚 りょうこ) did the voice acting for Coconut.\n\nI can totally recommend this novel, it might sound like i'm praising it a little too much in this review, but Nekopara means a lot to me, Nekopara Vol.1 actually introduced me to Visual Novels.\n\nand like it's prequel, Nekopara Vol.2 is released as both all-age and 18+, the steam version is of cause the all-age version and the 18+ version can be bought at Mangagamer and Denpasoft.\n\nthe all-age steam version is only half the price of the fully uncensored Denpasoft version, so you will need to pay another 10 bucks to get it uncensored, but its totally worth it, it adds a lot more story and the H scenes are great.\n\nSome extra bonuses:\n+Good Price\n+Steam Trading Cards/Badges/Emoticons/Backgrounds\n+Achievements\n+Petting Mode\n\nbtw, Chocola is still best catgirl <3 :DD","February 19","true","23.2"," 93 of 119 people (78%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","78","93","119","15","7"

Secks.\n- An actually decent plot that gets surprisingly emotional at times.\n- Heroines that change as the plot progresses.\n- An uncensored patch exists. And IT'S GLORIOUS.\n- Sayori drew this. And Sayori is amazing.\n- Good music.\n- Gorgeously animated.\n\nCons:\n- Sexy time costs extra\n- Sexy scenes lag if you have a crappy computer.\n- ♥♥♥♥ mosaics\n- You can't seduce Cinnimon until the next game comes out.\n\nOverall, I highy recommend this game for not only the cute anime catgirl booty, but also for its dynamic plotline, beautiful visuals, and its lovely pair of heroines.

Have you ever experienced having a girlfriend? Have you ever had any type of physical female contact in your life? If you answered yes, no and no, this is the perfect VN for you.\n\nFor the third installment in the Nekopara franchise, this novel really has you in a trance as you go through it. You're brought on an emotional joyride as you experience feelings like: love, sadness, empathy, friendship, joy, pain, and many more. This is a novel that certainly keeps on giving, and has tons of replayability.\n\nThe catgirls are still their same old selves, but the two new catpanions show a new side to there love for you. Finally you can enjoy pretending to feel the insides of Coconut and Azuki's nether regions. Or if you're more sentimental, pretending that you really are sleeping right next to them. Truly some heart melting and blissful moments.\n\nThe novel also adds a touch of feels, as you experience the breaking of bonds between the two new catpanions. I felt as if my two own unexistant and extremely attractive catgirl sisters had split ways. Thankfully, the two are able to mend their relationship, and rekindle their love in a loving and sweet embrace.\n\nIf anything will stop depression, it won't be this game. Simply because once you've finished reading the novel, you find yourself back where you started. Alone, cold, and with the realisation that you will never have a qt3.14 catgirl waifu. Suddenly, after enjoying the fun and beauty of this novel, you're driven that much closer to suicide. After relishing in the glory and funfilled lives of the Minaduki family, I found myself saddend by the fact that I would never experience such a thing in my everyday life. I would never get to enjoy the feeling of caressing a real catgirl's hair and tail, or hear them purr in response. I would never achieve the level of happiness I had felt when sleeping next to best cat Azuki.\n\nHonestly a well made and enjoyable novel. Quality story, quality adult scenes, quality voice acting, etc. The only issue I found was that, well, these assbangers made Azuki pee on me during sex. LIKE WHY DID YOU HAVE TO MAKE THE BEST GIRL A PISSER. HOW MANY PEOPLE DID YOU ACTUALLY THINK WERE GONNA GO: "OH HELL YEAH SHE'S A PISSER."? GOD DAMNIT IT RUINED THE MOMENT SO HARD. Soiled my 10/10 rating to a 9.5/10. At least I can skip over the pee scene, but ultimately I just lose out of more valuable seconds looking at Azuki.","March 4","true","5.2"," 42 of 53 people (79%) found this review helpful 41 people found this review funny","79","42","53","41","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Randomiser/recommended/420110/","Randomiser","Randomiser","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Randomiser/","55 products in account","Ever since I married Chocola and Vanilla, I've never been happier. I was excited for this amazing game because it lets me spend more quality time with them.\nWhat I didn't expect was for Coconut and Azuki to fall in love with me as well. I didn't think it was possible, but soon my heart began to beat the way it did when Chocola and Vanilla changed my life so long ago. However, I could never love Coconut and Azuki as much as my two wives. I am truly in love with them, and blessed to be married to such beautiful catgirls.\n\nMy only complaint is that Chocola and Vanilla have been downgraded to secondary characters. 9/10\n\nEDIT: I awoke in a dark room, sprawled against the cold concrete floor. There was a dull throbbing in the back of my head, and my mouth was filled with the taste of cotton. I could barely move my body. I started to shuffle around in confusion, until I heard footsteps slowly approaching my direction. A familiar, monotone voice addressed me.\n"It looks like you've been spending a lot of time with our older sisters lately."\n\nVanilla's figure slowly emerged from the darkness, leading Chocola right behind her. The footsteps continued until they were close enough that I could smell the dried blood on their bodies. Chocola towered over me, staring down at me with a frenzy in her eyes. I could feel her breathing heavily as she spoke.\n\n"You didn't abandon us, did you Master?! Master, that's not true, is it? Tell me it's a lie, Master!!! MASTER?!?!?"\n\nI tried to speak, but no words would came out. Instead, my throat could only tremble pathetically.\n\nVanilla just stared straight ahead with her arms behind her back, devoid of any emotion.\n"A promise is a promise, Master. You said it would be just the two of us, and no one else. Forever."\n\n"FOREVER!" Chocola shrieked. She suddenly struck her foot down with incredible force, leaving a crack in the ground beside my skull. She continued to twitch in place, with a huge, toothless grin plastered on her face.\n\nVanilla knelt down next to me, still avoiding my gaze. Her face was inches from my body, yet she looked at me like a distant object, like I wasn't even there. With one hand she caressed my body with her nails, while finally revealing what she had concealed behind her back: One long, sharp knife, absolutely corroded with rust.\n\n"It looks like we'll have to teach him the consequences of toying with catpanions' feelings."\nShe spoke with indifference. No sympathy, not even any cruelty. Just the cold matter-of-factness of something that had to be done.\n\nShe traced the blade across my neck in a slow, agonizing motion. The jagged metal dug in and scraped my skin as she dragged it across. Vanilla pressed harder, while Chocola's breathing grew more hysteric. Just as I could feel the skin about to break, Chocola shrieked.\n"B-But Master loved us!"\n\nVanilla stopped. She withdrew the knife, its tip still fresh with my blood, but held it close.\n"Of course..." She spoke directly into my ear. "Perhaps we could give you another chance, Master. All you have to do is warn the others not to cheat on their catgirls. And, of course, promise to never leave us again."\n\nI still couldn't speak to give my answer, but she finally looked into my eyes and seemed to understand. She nodded faintly, and stood up.\n\n"This time, we'll make sure it's a promise you won't break."\nShe produced a scroll of paper with symbols written on it that matched no language I had ever seen before. Holding the moist tip of the knife like a pen, she scribbled a circle with my own blood.\n"It is done."\n\nThe paper immediately burst into flames, and I felt my entire body shudder violently. Chocola clapped gleefully and jumped for joy, her usual demeanor returning to her. She quickly pulled me to my feet and hugged me, squeezing hard enough to break a few ribs.\n"This calls for a celebration, Master!"\n\nChocola reached behind herself to pull out a surprise. She raised an enormous axe above her shoulder like a baseball bat. I don't know how she was hiding that thing behind her back, but there it was, gleaming like it was the weapon of some RPG hero. Its size would have been comical if it weren't being swung directly into my head.\n\n"Goodnight, Master!~ ❤"\nMy vision went black.\n\n~☆~☆~☆~☆~☆~☆~☆~☆~☆~☆~\n\nI woke again in front of my laptop, with a new pain in the recess of my head, and the Nekopara Vol. 2 OP playing on the screen. Because of these changes, I would like to update my rating to a 10/10! I love Neko Works!","February 21","true","253.6"," 44 of 59 people (75%) found this review helpful 52 people found this review funny","75","44","59","52","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jamfrost/recommended/420110/","Jamfrost","Jamfrost Jamiro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jamfrost/","623 products in account","Nekopara is back and Shigure is as weird as ever. Prepare to journey into the second volume of this kinetic novel series and submerge yourself in catgirls. The series maintains its high quality visuals, light animations, chibi art, Japanese-only voice acting, and adds some new effects to the mix. The Steam version will last only about 4+ hours because they put in a huge effort for the h-content side of things. On to other things!\n\nStoryThe game continues Kashou’s story and revolves around the development of Azuki and Cononut as characters. Chocola and Vanilla are there in the beginning, but the game shifts its focus to the other two catgirls. I definitely enjoyed Kashou’s comedic role as the straight man with the jokes and misunderstandings. He’s not going through a rough patch like in Vol. 1, so he’s mostly adding to the comedy and relationships. A story isn’t very interesting without any conflicts, so you can expect our characters to face a couple obstacles along the way as they bake their way into happiness.\n\nH-contentThe developer made it easier to acquire the erotic content for this game without having to go the two copies route, one on Steam and one on a website. People can go to the website (use Google) that sells an auto-patcher for $9.99 featuring over 2 hours of additional content if you leave it on auto-play (best way to keep the keyboard clean) and listen to all the voice work. The additional scenes are quite substantial and go full hentai with the shortest one being around 30 minutes. They use a mixture of stills, light animation (which can be turned off), and lewd sounds. They also made Kashou have a superhuman amount of “frosting” to give. The scenes seemed a little too long, but that just means that they’ll entertain others for quite a bit of time if the body is willing.\n\nThere are some things to consider before purchasing the patch. The scenes cause a bit of a tonal change, probably due to the length of them as the sensual frolicking did last for quite a while. The game goes from cute to very, very sticky. The writing also shifts into porn territory with the lewd version of “come” and its conjugations being used frequently. At one point, I saw “baby bakery” with “man-batter” being used in a single sentence. There are also slurping sounds. If you want to maintain a lighter, perverted mood, then the patch might not be the best idea. Stick with the Steam version instead or be prepared to see them in a different light. For example, I have a hard time remembering the plot because the game ended soon after an hour long lovemaking scene. I’m pretty sure it was a happy ending. Oho! Lastly, the h-content has mosaic censorship in place and please make sure to stay moisturized with a clean towel nearby while playing this game.\n\nThe BugIn my playthrough, for the whole experience, there was a frequently occuring auto-play bug that stopped the game from progressing until I clicked or pressed enter. This interrupted my relaxed state as I did prefer sitting back while reading what was happening. It went something… *click* like this. It never went away. I still see it in my sleep. Be warned! There were also a couple of weird graphical glitches happening with mouths closing and opening a bit too fast while speaking. They contributed to my impression that the game wasn’t as polished since auto-play is how I roll, but maybe other people will not have the same issue.\n-\nNekopara Vol. 2 seems like a fine entry for the series. It double downs on the h-content if you want erotic shenanigans and has a proper story, unlike Vol. 0. As a reminder, this game isn’t a dating sim. There are no choices. It’s a kinetic novel.

What is this an alternate universe or something ?!\n\nNekopara Vol.2 is a kinetic novel and as you can see from the title, this is a sequel for as you can guess it, Nekopara Vol.1. Soo, is this a good kinetic novel ? Is the intended purpose of this kinetic novel is achieved ? Should i buy it ? Its kinda hard to answer all that questions with a simple yes and no, soo i will tell you all about it in this long wall of text.\n\nFirst thing first, the writing is kinda a mixed bag, the first, second, and third chapter is good if your expection for this kinetic novel is the same as the first one to get a giggle along with a cutenessgasm, you will not get a deep plot since that isn't the point of this kinetic novel. Its the charm of the first one and for the first 4 chapters, its the charm of it also. But it kinda fell apart after that, i don't know if it because of lazyness or lack of time, since the writing talent is there but unfortunately every new characters is only introduced and not explore further which is really sad since the introduction is good and solid. In this Vol.2 the introduction of the characters is like checking a check list before the novel get to other main part if you bought the adult version, the adult scene. The worse part is, the last 3 chapters is really short if you didn't count the adult scene. You can finished the chapter 7 in about 5 minutes, 5 minutes !! I can say i'm really dissapointed in it, since there's a lot more plot conflict and character development in Vol.1 than Vol.2 and it took 13 hours to finished Vol.1 compare to 6 hours in Vol.2. Vol.1 got me to care for the main characters, Chocola and Vanilla more than Vol.2 main characters, Coconut and Azuki. To get Chocola and Vanilla to be the protagonist catpanion took a couple conflict that get me to like them in the process, but in Vol.2 the main protagonist just have to be nice and horny a little, and there you go catpanion and the adult scene reward for the player.\n\nThe art and visual is one of the best in visual/kinetic novel game that i played. Since well, the characters is moving with the help of the E-mote system, just see the Vol.1 introduction trailer in Sekai Project channel if you want to see it in action. It makes the whole novel feel a lot more cuter and livelier than a normal kinetic novel which is really great. I wish all japanese visual novel use this system more than it currently is, but that's just my dream. The background of all scene is nicely drawn, i can't really complain about it that much. Again, if only more time being put in making the plot and character development, this could be a lot more fun experience.\n\nSoo, Is this a great kinetic novel ? No, it lack deep plot and good conflict that a great kinetic novel has. Is this a good kinetic novel and serve its purpose ? Yes if you put your reading experience to get a fun and cute experiences, but it could be a much much much better. At this stage, it just a kinetic novel to fill your cutegasm and enjoy the adult scene, if you played the adult version. Am i recommending this novel ? Yes, only if you already try the first one and enjoy it. But you still will feel disappointed when you finished it, not because this is bad but because this could be a better one.","March 5","true","6.7"," 20 of 27 people (74%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","74","20","27","3","0"

Protagonist (pervy) pastry chef Kashou has a chance to get closer to the other catgirls, particularly Coconut, the clumsy younger sister, and Azuki, the sarcastic older sister. There are fights, misunderstandings, and many, many tears, but ultimately love and affection will conquer all.\n\nIt's a sweet, heartwarming story, but it's also extremely predictable and follows the same basic pattern as Vol. 1. Most people probably don't play NEKOPARA for the plot, but if you're looking for something more than silly slice-of-life, then this isn't for you. I would have preferred a little more variation as I feel that the characters lose some of their individuality when their issues all essentially boil down to being head over heels for Master, but their personalities do shine through in their speech and interactions.\n\nThe production quality is as high as ever with gorgeous, vibrant artwork from Sayori-san. Every CG, SD, character sprite, and background is an absolute joy to look at although I unfortunately didn't notice any new backgrounds that we hadn't seen in Vol. 1.\n\nThe E-mote system is used to great effect to bring the character sprites to life, and the movements and facial expressions are perfectly matched with the speech. Vol. 2 also retains the "chest bounciness" slider from Vol. 1 and the "petting" mode from Vol. 0, which are both fun additions.\n\nVoice acting is wonderful as always, sound effects are used well, and the music is lovely, although it is mostly the same as in Vol. 1. There are also two super upbeat new opening and ending tracks!\n\nWhile the Steam version is supposedly all-ages, it does get quite lewd in places, and I was surprised by just how risque some of the content was. There is no nudity, but some of the conversations and sound effects go beyond being simply suggestive.\n\nIn conclusion, while this newest installment doesn't bring anything new to the table, it's a ton of fun to be back in the bright & bouncy world of NEKOPARA, making Vol. 2 a must-play for fans of the series. It's also a visually beautiful, high-quality visual novel with a great translation, so if you're new to the NEKOPARA phenomenon I highly recommend checking out Vol. 1 to see what you think.\n\nClick here to read the full review[merumeruchan.wordpress.com]\nFollow the Visual Novel Fans curator list","February 20","true","3.9"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","15","18","0","0"

So Nekopara is a animated VN that if you are on this page you already know about and at this moment in time is one of the top rated games on Steam. But what has changed from the first game and prequel? Well nothing much apart from the petting feature has returned and you can even pet the catgirl that you met in the first game now. The story now focuses on 2 of the different catgirls all though Chocola and Vanilla are still given their fair share of time.\n\nSo I am a sucker for stories that can be emotional and surprisingly for what is considered a "single player game so you play with yourself" game that is what is you get, these emotional scenes typically come about after the 18+ scenes when the protagonist is bonding? With the catgirl who he has just spent the past 25 minutes inside of.\n\nNow the 18+ scenes that is what most of you are really here for.\n\nStraight off the bat there has been an official 18+ patch that can be bought which is a nice change from the previous games. And the scenes themselves are.. good quality? I honestly don't play a lot of VNs hell I rarely even review games. I started referencing Nekopara in an ironic way but then it just sort of became something that stuck with me.\n\nSo should you buy Nekopara? Well if you don't mind appearing offline for the time you are planning on playing it and if you are prepared for any "what the ♥♥♥♥ are you playing" questions then yeah it is a pleasant little VN with an average but nice story with a few twists and turns which are predictable no doubt but still nice enough to not come across as too cliche, and the 18+ scenes are well put together as opposed to being crammed in without any warning.\n\nI can't wait for Volume 3 to be released so I can be a huge let down to my friends and family even more!\n","February 21","true","10.2"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","100","10","10","8","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SnowonHokkaido/recommended/420110/","SnowonHokkaido","¤ Queen of Doughnuts","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SnowonHokkaido/","183 products in account","Bought the first game as a joke and strangely grew to like the series. Don't misunderstand me - I'm a girl and I think the games are cute, although the sexual context is obviously given. I see it as a cute Visual Novel, but I've never actually played the 18+ content, so don't read on if you're just interested in that.\n\nHaving played Nekopara 0, 1 and 2, I can say that the latest game (2) is definitely not as tedious as the previous main game (1). Nekopara 0 is actually bonus content for game number 1 with an additional story line which I enjoyed even though it was rather short. While Nekopara 1 mainly focuses on Chocola and Vanilla, Nekopara 2 actively involves the other catgirls as well. I'm personally not such a big fan of the Chocola & Vanilla combination (I'm a girl after all), but I've come to identify with Coconut. Hence, I've been enjyoing the new approach and am really happy that I'm getting to see some more Coconut content (yay!).\n\nGenerally speaking, the story starts where Nekopara 1 ended, and the game has a strong focus on the relationships between the catgirls/and the main character (you). I think this is a very nice approach since it makes the characters more likeable. Additionally, the graphics have been updated and the characters appear even more real (Great!) while the interface hasn't really changed. It's still simple and available in at least 3 languages.\n\nPositive:\n\n+ Improved story line\n+ more character attributes (characters feel real)\n+ improved graphics/gestures/interaction\n+ OK translation\n+ NEW feature (as seen in Nekopara 0): pet your cats!\n\n- story line may seem rather long (5 hours play time is a lot for a Visual Novel without choices)\n- may not be suitable for girls due to sexual references\n\nAll in all, I consider myself an open person and would recommend this game for girls and guys interested in the series, and for the (lonely) player. But keep in mind that the steam version is censored and if you're expecting certain sexual content, you're wrong here.","March 2","true","9.8"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","9","11","2","1"

Hands down the most in depth game I have ever played. Decision making has never been this impactful before. Let's break this down:\n\nGraphics 10/10\nThe art style used in this game fits perfectly. Unbelieveably good physics! You can tell it took them a long time to design all the zones and unique characters.\n\nMusic 10/10\nI love music in a game and this is a great example why! Upbeat tunes to keep you light-hearted and hyped. Whoever orchestrated the OST for this game is a musical genius.\n\nStory 11/10\nEvery time I have to stop playing this game, I feel like I'm on a massive cliff hanger. ♥♥♥♥ is crazy. When Coconut saves that poor girl with here amazing cat speed you can't help tearing up. Explore a vast world with your cat companions and help Coconut get over her insecurity. So ♥♥♥♥ing good!

He sets up on a small shop/apartment called La Soleli, sporting western-style flairs.\nWhile getting ready to unpack his boxes of cargo, he discovers two unfamiliar boxes in the open. He is then surprised to find out that Chocola (ショコラ) and Vanilla (バニラ), two of his family's nekos, followed him by stowing away in the boxes.\nAfter a lot of drama, Kashou decide to keep Chocola and Vanilla by his side and then later on makes the two of them, his maid employees at the shop and catpanions in the end.\nBut Chocola and Vanilla aren't the only catgirls in the Minaduki family. Chocola and Vanilla got four sisters, Azuki (アズキ) and Coconut (ココナツ) (which is the central characters in Vol.2) and Maple (メイプル) and Cinnamon (シナモン), you don't get to meet these four sister cats much in Vol.1, but you get to know them a lot better, in the Vol.0 fan prequel that was released last summer, but I can tell you, that these four sister catgirls still live home with Kashou's younger sister Shigure (時雨), which is the person, responsible for taking care of and educating and training the catgirls, so they can obtain their bells.\n\nCatgirls will need to obtain a bell (also known as Independent Action Permit) to become independent, meaning the catgirls can go to public places without their master/owner, it can be substituted in place of the catgirl's identification papers and also allows the catgirls to enter establishments and events even when pets aren't allowed.\nTo obtain a bell, they will need to learn to control their cat instincts and act like human beings to pass the hard examen.\n\nI think that should be the most important parts of the story in Vol.1 and plot in Nekopara in general, that you will need to know, to be able to continue with Vol.2.\n\n\nActual review:\nThis is by far, one of the best and most loved VN series released on steam, it's so cute and I guarantee you, that you will immediately start smiling as soon as you launch Nekopara.\nThe story is great and especially for an adult VN, they sometimes lack a little on the story part, but that's far from the case in Nekopara, it's a short but well written story.\n\nand for a great story, fit a great artstyle and the artstyle in Nekopara is incredible and is made by one of my favorite artists and the founder of Nekoworks: Sayori (さより), a really talented japanese lady, she is also known for "Muv-Luv Alternative Chronicles" and "Boku to Koi Suru Ponkotsu Akuma", she currently lives in Japan, but is born and raised in China (from what I know off)\n\nand like everything else, the audio and soundtracks are astounding as well, it's composed by Nao and Haruka Shimotsuki, there aren't much information about Nao, but Haruka Shimotsuki (霜月はるか) is a Japanese singer and dōjin music composer known for her vocal themes in the Atelier Iris and Ar tonelico series, and those two did a great job on composing the soundtracks for Nekopara, you won't be able to get those soundtracks out of your head again, trust me, when I first read Nekopara, I was humming the soundtracks for atleast a week or two.\n\nThe two voice actors for Azuki and Coconut, did a great job on their voice acting as well, but that's no real surprise, the japanese always master their voice acting and it's usually always in a really high quality, Mia Naruse (成瀬未亜) also known as Mio Nonose (野々瀬 ミオ) did the voice acting for Azuki and Tezuka Ryouko (手塚 りょうこ) did the voice acting for Coconut.\n\nI can totally recommend this novel, it might sound like i'm praising it a little too much in this review, but Nekopara means a lot to me, Nekopara Vol.1 actually introduced me to Visual Novels.\nLike it's prequel, Nekopara Vol.2 is released as both all-age and 18+, the steam version is of cause the all-age version and the 18+ version can be bought at Mangagamer and Denpasoft.\n\nBut don't worry, you dont need to buy the game a second time, if it's like it's prequel, you will be able to patch the steam version to unlock the 18+ content, check out the guides under the Nekopara community page and I'm sure you will find a guide or some nice people who can help you patch the game.\n\nSome extra bonuses:\n+Good Price\n+Steam Trading Cards/Badges/Emoticons/Backgrounds\n+Achievements\n+Petting Mode","February 19","true","8.2"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","9","14","2","0"

Again!\n\nIf you have read the previous VNs, you know what to expect. If you haven't read the Nekopara series before, this is the third VN to date. Vol 1 starts you off and focuses on the main catgirls: Chocola and Vanilla, Vol 0 is a prequel, giving you some backstory on all the characters and Vol 2 mainly focuses on Azuki and Coconut, two of the other catgirls. Reading them in order is recommended but not exactly required.\n\nThis is a kinetic novel (no choices or branching paths) that continues the rather cute story of yourself (a pastery shop owner), your catgirls, your sister and her catgirls all running the shop and it's presented along with Sayori's beautiful artwork. This game also uses the E-Mote System, a Live2D-like system of character animation that really brings the characters to life. Petting Mode also returns from Vol 0 allowing you pet anyone that appears in an E-Mote animated scene. Gotta pet them all! The production values are as high as you can expect.\n\nAlso note that unlike Vol 1, Vol 2 has an official patch for turning the all-ages Steam version into the R18 version. The patch restores all the content that was cut from the all-ages version. It does apply censoring if you take screenshots or stream but while reading and not streaming it is completely intact. The patch is available on Denpasoft if you search around.\n\nThe game length will depend on your reading speed, how often you take breaks to pet your catgirls and whether or not you bought the patch with it's added content but it should definately last about 6 hours or more. Well worth the $10 or $20 it costs.","February 20","true","8.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

This game, like volume 1, contains 3 sex scenes, all of which need the R18 patch on the Steam version. They are slightly more spaced out, as Chocola and Vanilla get theirs at the beginning, while Coconut gets her's with Chocola on the second to last day and Azuki gets her's with Vanilla on the last day. The game is a lot more story driven (the reason I play these games) (no seriously), and there are a few moments that very nearly made me cry. All in all, the game has the appeal of both perverts and those who enjoy a heartwarming story to it. If you are even slightly interested, I suggest giving it a go.\n\nP.S. The button in the top right allows you to pet the girls (yes, including Shigure)\nP.P.S. The 'P' button is the "Jiggle Physics" button\n\nEDIT: There is a free R18 patch that a video is available for on YouTube. I've installed it. By comparing with my friend who has the R18 version I can say that it works and that it is legitimate. (#HaveAWank)\n\nEDIT Mk. 2: There is also a free R18 patch for Nekopara Vol. 1, which is also amazing and you should totally buy it as well.","February 20","true","14.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The genius writing, the clever use of symbolism, foreshadowing and depth, combined with lifelike characters, create one of the most unique and immersive experiences I have ever come across in my life, even rivaling classic novels and puts them to shame. It even crosses the line of some taboo topics such as racism and conspiracy theories, a marvel indeed. But it doesn't stop there, it comes with top-notch visual fidelity, even now for a 1-month old title and a soundtrack, that will make you forget Hans Zimmer, Michael McCann or Yuki Kajiura existed. A wonderful composition, which will make you ask the important questions in your life. I wrote this review listening to some of the tracks and I had to tear up so many times thinking about the fantastic ending this game had.\n\nThis is truly a masterpiece and it's a shame, that only so few people know of this timeless classic. A must-play for the thinking gamer. The savior of this rotten gaming industry. Play this game, buy this game. As a human being which calls itself a gamer, playing this title is your holy duty.","March 18","true","1.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","1"

It’s difficult to express just how huge and open this world is: verdant, rolling fields liberally dotted with swaying foliage of every shape and size fill the space between loosely connected, ramshackle townships where people struggle to scrape by. A full day/night cycle and dynamic weather pull it all together, cementing Nekopara vol. 2’s landscape as one of the most authentic-feeling open worlds I’ve ever seen. A handy minimap points you where you want to go, which might seem like a crutch, but honestly, without it, I’d have been hopelessly lost. That a world this size still feels so purposeful, and full of things to do is quite an achievement.\n\n10/10","February 20","true","6.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","3","5","3","0"

Nobody calls it that. Everyone calls it Neko Paradise, because its full of super cute catgirls in maid outfits. The cakes are pretty good too. Last night though, I happened to walk by the storefront after they closed, and I could see into the kitchen through the window behind the register. The owner was screwing one of his cats. ON ONE OF THE COUNTERS IN THE KITCHEN!!! I couldn't believe my eyes. Those are food preparation surfaces! I was absolutely disgusted by this clear disregard for food safety. Never again will I eat one of their cakes. I'll settle for the tea.","June 5","true","5.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","50","1","2","4","0"

Even more cat girls in seifuku? This game deserves a 10/10.\n\nIn all honesty though, a sequel to one of the best animated VNs of all time. The amount of work Sayori put into this is just amazing. Character details and animations are brilliantly done for a VN. They even incorporated the game window into the game, moving the game in windowed mode moves the characters in the game.\n\nA slightly short VN in comparison to others, story is well done but not the best, personally I believe the story could have been longer. There is only one path in the game, but it doesn't effect the game's entertainment at all. When Vol 3 is  released, I'm sure they'll incorporate possibly even more choices and an even larger story.\n\nI'll give this VN a 10/10 though, voice acting is superb, the VN's entertainment was top notch, and the animation is out of the world.

And Coconut suffers from lack of confidence and admires Kashou also calling him "Brother".\n\nIt's the usual like in the first one you get to read, pet and have intimate releationship with the girls(Patch required!).\n\nOverall very well produced and delivered.

The animation is better, it looks better, and the cast is still charming. If you're interested in VN's, this title has little to no user input but it's a fun story. My one complaint is the series is getting slightly formulaic. Without wishing to spoil, I hope Nekopara 3 adds a bit more to the story.\n\nNothing to really complain otherwise though. Its still a cute and fun experience.","February 20","true","4.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","2"

Mood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anitude/","940 products in account","Taking place after Vol. 1 and maybe being a bit shorter in length the bigger focus in this one now are on the flat-and-small Azuki and the well-endowed-and-tall Coconut with supporting appearances by Chocola & Vanilla. If one of them has happened to become your favorite catgirl then this is likely for you (lucky me Coconut & Vanilla were my favorites from the beginning). It shows a bit more of the original two and introduces & opens you more to the starring catgirls, possibly in multiple other ways.\n\nThe "petting" option returns from Vol. 0. Always a nifty feature I think. Unfortunately just like in Vol. 0 you may not "pet" lower than the stomach area, even if you think and can see the lower half of a body.\n\nThe 18+ patch itself (however you may acquire it) is a .exe patcher which itself is around 500MB. It opens you up to witness a few more possibilities in how catgirls can get intimate with their owners as you go about regularly within the VN. Sadly it's designed so that if you wish to take a basic Steam screenshot of the catgirls visibly pleasing their owner and, as a result, themselves then the screenshot and its thumbnail will be replaced with a mosaic instead.\nThere are technically only 3 of these highly desirable scenarios in the complete product with at least one catgirl getting a turn throughout the entirety of the VN (with the exclusion of Maple & Cinammon of course). The first one starts relatively early on showing you Chocola & Vanilla.\n\nYou've got your continued story of a dream here that many wish to be a reality and I currently anticipate the next addition, Vol. 3, with what many expect is to feature Cinammon and another favorite of mine, Maple next.","February 20","true","13.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

You have been warned.\nKashou's thoughts before Coconut's /scene/\n\nWhy is Coconut so perfect?\n\nIs it her cute and angelic face? Her ample bosom? Her long legs that just seem to go on forever? Her beautiful set of eyes? Her soft, lightbrown hair? The fact she looks stunning wearing that uniform? Her kind and tender heart? Her melodious voice? The way she puts aside her personal feelings for the sake of the people she loves?\n\nWhenever she appears, I just cannot stop my fantasies from growing wild. Can you even imagine it? Coconut being led to an empty bedroom and with you on the lead,you lightly pushed her back on the bed, pinning her in place. Gently, you unveiled your desires by leaning over and pressing your lips against hers. And for this, she answered by stretching out her tongue inside to dance with your kisses.\n\nAs she savoured the deepest recesses of your throat, your hand instinctively reached out and slowly made its way under her the fabric of her or rather the shirt I lent to her. In response to your touch, Coconut closed her eyes and anticipated where your ministrations will lead. With a small smile, your hand slipped through her *** and cupper her mounds, caressing it at your leisure. At first, your fingers only twiddled with her ******* but as it goes on, your primal needs took in and you began to torment the girl by clamping it tightly and watched as how she writhe both in pain and pleasure. The heat of her skin rose as the libido coursed through her veins. Her undiluted moans echo within the room.\n\nSeeing how she reacted has filled you with delight but your heart still aches for more. Placing kisses on her cheeks, you slowly made your way down to her neck. Your hand crawled down to the valley that hides between the chartered area. She gasped upon sensing your fingers, as if inviting you to ravish her further and you accepted that invitation with glee.\n\nYou descended down to your knees. And as if unwrapping a present, you moved her ******* aside and came upon the lovely flower that she gave for you alone. When you caught the captivating scent of her, you were unable to hold back any longer and you plunged right through the depths of her lovely garden. The essence of her love flowed freely upon your tongue, satiating your hunger with a flavour that is maddeningly sweet.\n\nWhat is it, gentlemen? What is it that makes Coconut so perfect?\n\n...Vanilla was right.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=628572893\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=628575581","February 20","true","6.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

Something had to be done. So instead of just 'interacting' with Vanilla and Chocola, they decided "♥♥♥♥ it" literally. Obviously these scenes aren't included in steams version because they dont allow indecency in their games, although they will allow incredible blood and gore. Weird huh?\n\nSo anyway, in this game, you get closer to Coconut and Azuki, 2 catgirls whom also work alongside the other cat girls in the cafe. During this time you see romance, heartbreak, and ... suspense.\n\nYeah 9/10 to be fair, because even with the 18+ scenes included everything is still pixelated.

I sit on my computer as I watch the most amazing gameplay sitting in front of my eyes realizing that people died in trenches in WW1 for me to sit at my computer and talk to non-existant cat girls through a computer screen showing me only pixels. The most amazing gameplay is clicking the mouse or hitting the space bar through out the entire game only to figure out that there is an auto play button. Now I can sit there like playing bayonetta 1 & 2 in a one handed mode position but this time it requires no hands. I would personally give this a 10/10 for the most beautiful story about a man who is attracted to his cats in general. It's also revealed in the ending that he is actually a man locked up in an aslyum assuming that he is in a world full of cat girls. This is the story about Cory baxter and how he had to move with his aunty in bel-air. 1000/10\n\nNote:\nNo but in reality this is actually really good and designed.I highly suggest playing this in your down time if you really like visual novels.

The point is, if you put down names, you can retell both Vol. 1 and 2 by LITERALLY the same words:  you have 2 girls, after a short time you begin to feel something for both of them, they begin to feel something for you, there is a bit of jealousy and drama, but eventually everything settles down, you have a bit of sex, both of the girls agrees that "Ménage à trois" cat family is not so bad, shazam, happy ending. For the most people this is not a "crime", but as for me, after ending of the first episode (out of 7), I already knew how Vol. 2 would go further on, and how this would end, simply because I've already seen all of it in Vol. 1!\nYou could've called it "remake", if not one simple thing. Now, I don't want to sound like a complete jerk, but the most of the audiovisual part is old, I mean, it's just from Vol. 1! Undoubtedly this doesn't mean it's bad at any point - everything from backgrounds to voice acting is absolutely gorgeous, but alredy used. It's like 2 stage plays in the same theatre, by the same script, with almost all of the same backgrounds, costumes and music but just different main actors, difference in one year and considering to be part 1 and part 2.\nAnd the thing that I am really afraid of - the next Vol is gonna be just the same, but once again just different girls.","February 19","false","6.6"," 117 of 367 people (32%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","32","117","367","35","17"

This time the focus is on the eldest and youngest of the older sisters; Azuki and Coconut.\n\nThe story is a lot better this time around and seems to give a lot more depth to the two girls than Vol 1 did with Chocola and Vanilla, that's all I really have to say about the SFW part of this.\n\nPlaying this with the +18 patch is really where the game comes to life, mainly because we finally get to see scenes where there are actual fat cat tats to jiggle around and really make use of that bounciness slider I assume every last one of you want to smash up to full like myself. The lewd parts are better this time around purely because there are actual cat tats bouncing around and being quite aesthetically pleasing, I also believe the quality of the CG's has gone up.\n\nOverall, this one is better than Vol 1 and Vol 0 combined.

If you like all of the above, then why are you even reading this review? You should be playing Nekopara!\n\nPros:\nVery nice art.\nUnique interaction and animations from characters sprites that you don't find in many other visual novels.\nSome of the scenes provide a semi 3D animation and look while still keeping to the traditional 2D feel which is really nice.\nPretty good OST. It's not super amazing but it's still likeable and good enough to listen to on repeat.\nLots of "plot."\nThe VA (voice acting) in this is absolutely stunning. The girls who VA'd this did a great job.\nEasy to decensor.\nNew petting feature and "P" key spammability.\nPlenty of other kinds of "Petting." (﻿ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\nProvides an alternative cure to depression.\n\nCons:\nA few graphical/text bugs that aren't gamebreaking and are barely noticeable, It's nothing to worry about though.\nThis one is around a chapter shorter than Vol.1 but it certainly didn't lack in its "backstory."\nHas an ending.\n\n\nNekopara Vol.3 HYPE!

It is also very well drawn. The intro and outro videos are also pretty great, with the music being very catchy!\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nFeature that I liked that wasn't in Vol 1 that is in Vol 2 (and 0): While this was in Vol 0, it hasn't been in the main series (Vol 0 being a fandisk) until now. This is the 'petting' feature. It allows you to pet your Nekos (and sister ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ) in a variety of places, including their head which makes them purr. This feature is used for some of the achievements - you need to pet them all.\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nIf you liked Vol 1, I would very much recommend this one.\n\n...What are you doing?

It seems like the manager of the shop is creating a harlem and so far has 4 cargril companions. Not sure this is good or bad, but not much of a fan on it. And it might be too predicable with Maple and Cinamon would follow along as well.\n\nGuess it is fan serivce stuff, not sure. Personally if there is going to be a Vol. 3, I rather have Maple and Cinamon fall for different guys then go for their master then become too predictable.\n\nI thnk I would recommend this, but still unsure of the direction of the series...","February 20","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Definately :)\nI loved Vol 1. It was the first VN I ever read, and it's still my favourite of all time. Vol 2 didn't dissapoint as its sequel, with the right blend of lovable characters and strong story (which isn't a given in VNs, to be frank - lets face it, most people don't read these for the story). Although I still prefer the first (by a very slim amount), Vol 2 still managed to keep me riveted until the end.\n\nPros :\nAdorable characters (with unexpected depth, lol)\nWell-considered and occasionally beautifully heart-wrenching story (in other words, not on par with the usual VN style of just an excuse to get the girls naked every five minutes)\nAddictive as hell (which, okay, sometimes can be a problem, but meh :D)\n\nCons :\nEr...\nUm...\nAsk me later.\nOr, y'know... don't :)\n\n100/10.

Nekopara Vol. 2 sort of requires its... 18+ Content.\nWell, let's just say, it's going to be around 2 hours if your playing just the Steam version unmodified.\nSo, if your willing to pay 5$ a hour for a short, but sweet visual novel, this is for you.\nIf you want 3+ Hours of additional scenes... You'll have to pay an extra 10$.\n\nHonestly, get the 18+ Version. It definently completes the experience, and is... well worth it. Trust me.\n\nAlso, NEKOPARA Vol. 2 does delve into some... odd elements.\nYour little sister seems to be... a bit too attached to you... Really, really attatched to you. At the start when she started suggesting things to the main character, I thought it was a joke... I'm not saying anything like that happens, your only going to be able to romance the cat girls. I'm just saying it was a bit odd that the little sister kept suggesting alot of lewd things. :I\nand people say Southern United States has an infamous reputation with incest...
