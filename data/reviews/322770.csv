(Given that I'm 49, that's saying something!) The first time I got into a straight up sword battle with a skeleton I grinned like a complete idiot. I dodged, he dodged. I'd block his blows, and he'd leap back to avoid mine. He'd land a wound and I'd yell out of frustration, and every time I landed a strike I found myself taunting this digital mesh with all I had. I wasn't twiddling controllers here, or mashing on the "X" button; I was fighting a skeleton with a virtual sword, and loving every second of it.\n\nThe game isn't perfect, of course. It's too easy to teleport partially into a wall, and there are pacing issues evident even early on, but frankly, that doesn't matter. After defeating a skeleton archer in a bow battle, I laughed, stood up from behind my cover, and said "If this was World of Warcraft people would never leave."\n\nIf you own a Vive, you owe it to yourself to buy this title.","April 7","true","2.3"," 133 of 147 people (90%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","90","133","147","20","2"

There's so many things I want to say about this game.  For one, I have been waiting 12 years to play this game.  I know, it's only been a twinkle in a developer’s eye for a few months or so, but that doesn't change anything.\n\nWhen I was playing Morrowind, I wanted it to be this game.  When I played Diablo 1, I wanted it to be this game.  Heck, when I read books...I wanted them to be this game.  This game is not Morrowind or Diablo.  It's not any of those things.  This game is clunky, sloppy, graphically challenged (no offense, I still love them) and downright fantastic.\n\nIt has a taste, and truly just a taste, of everything I want in a video game.  Realistic sword movements, fun battles, gimmicky enemies, a touch of plot, a sprinkle of character, a hint of leveling, a smidge of puzzles, a dash of environmental interaction and a pinch of looting/customization.  This is by all means, a shadow of a good RPG.  But it doesn't matter.  We've all played these good RPGs, but what we want is to be in one.  This is as close as you can get right now.\n\nMy only negative is that it's tricky to interact with the belt, as in, a giant pain (unless I was doing something wrong) and it's too short.\n\nRemember when you senselessly fought things with the Wii-mote?  Remember when you bought a Playstation move and for a few hours thought it was awesome until you realized that, meh, not that great?  Remember when you wanted to be playing this game?  Well, lucky for you, this is that game.\n\nBuy it, support it, and get on the Dev's nerves about making it better and better.  I love this game.\n\n10/10 would snipe clipping skeleton king again.","April 27","true","5.7"," 56 of 60 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","56","60","0","0"

I decided to take the plunge, as much for lack of other content as anything.\n\nThis has been the single best experience I've ever had in gaming - by a wide margin. Not just VR, everything.\n\nTips to super-enjoying this:\n\n1. Let yourself be immersed. Try and BE the character you're playing. I felt giddy with excitement and anticipation by the end of this game because I let myself believe I was there.\n2. Move around frequently in your play-space. Since you teleport a lot in this game you can lose a sense of immersion if you do it too often. So just make sure you shift around a lot. Be free.\n3. If you do 1. right, then make sure you fight your enemies like they're going to bludgeon you to death if they actually land a hit. It'll put the hairs up on the back of your neck.\n\nLegit criticisms:\n\n1. AI is pretty crap in this. Enemies aren't smart and just sit there staring at you even though you're only 2 meters away.\n2. AI fights incredibly slowly. This is probably just the designers deciding to ease people in - but more frantic fights would be amazing.\n3. AI doesn't really adapt to your fight style - I'm sure this will be fixed in other games given time. But basically, enemies should be a bit more clever about blocking and dodging blows that you repeatedly land.\n4. Textures could do with a bump in resolution, but honestly, it doesn't matter too much since you get lost in the moment.\n5. MOAR CONTENT! Left me desperate for more.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis is the single best entertainment experience I've ever had. This game is amazing. It's a cliche, but seriously: this game is a must-have.\n\nIf you don't have a Vive. Get a Vive. Get this game.

The Vive removes those layers of abstraction. Which button do I press to gaze at an enemy and block that fireball? Who cares! Just look at that archer and raise your shield. Is there an arrow flying at you? Physically dodge it or duck behind that stone column for cover. Need to restore your health? Pull the potion out of your inventory and drink it.\n\nThrough these natural actions, and augmented by the haptic feedback of the Vive motion controllers, we’re projecting a tangible sense of agency into the game world in a way that was previously impossible. And the world responds accordingly.\n\nDuring a particularly heated battle, I was fending off two flanking archers, a healer, and a spellcaster (make that healer a priority kill with your bow & arrow!) who were guarding the coveted Dragon Wand. I emerged sweaty and out of breath from hiding behind trees, popping out of cover, dodging arrows, and just getting wrapped up in the heat of the moment. When you start dual-wielding swords and fighting increasingly brawny boss monsters, Vanishing Realms can even turn into a legitimate workout if you get carried away.\n\nI can easily say without reservation that Vanishing Realms is a visceral, awe-inspiring VR experience steeped in intuitive, tactile gameplay. It has left me satisfied but selfishly craving more. That it was created by a single developer in 8 months is nothing short of extraordinary, and I believe this paves the way for a surge of successful, micro-sized development teams making breakout games for virtual reality."\n\nFull review with gameplay: http://uploadvr.com/vanishing-realms-rite-of-steel-early-access-review-roomscale-dungeon-crawling/","April 5","true","4.2"," 74 of 99 people (75%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","75","74","99","11","11"

My first session was about 90 minutes and the only thing that made me pause was I needed a drink.  I really didn't want to take off the Vive and get something.  So my next session I donned a camelback full of some flavored water and back in I went.  I played a couple more hours and had such a good time fighting off monsters, picking coins out of thin air, getting my magic wand and defeating chapter 1.\n\nYou don't level up, you don't pick your class, break everything, pick up everything you can and keep it.  The environments are varied and well done - dwarven caves you can mine for big loot, outdoors by the ocean, into tombs and trapped passageways.  Really really well done.\n\nMy only criticism right now is the lack of a clear save point, checkpoint or otherwise letting you know that you can stop here and still have your progress later.  I got reset a couple times, but still had a good time moving quickly through content I had seen before.\n\nP.S. got shot in the shoulder with a crossbow bolt... it stuck out of my shoulder for a minute.

Search dungeon rooms for loot like you're really there; lean over to look inside barrels or behind statues for hidden treasure. Then use your sword and shield to parry opponents' attacks and then wait to swing while they're off guard, or dart forward to jab a vulnerable spot and leap back before they can hit you. And when I say dart forward and leap back, I don't mean with buttons on a controller.\n\nI have a decent sized playing area, so that's reflected in this review.

It's a straightforward homage to classic dungeon-crawlers, except that you actually get to feel what it's like to crawl said dungeon. The enemies are intimidating, combat is satisfying, and the environments are great.\n\nThere are a lot of rough edges, to be fair. The bow is somehow simultaneously unsatisfying and OP. The inventory could use some work. Enemies don't have a ton of variety and the big bosses are "bullet sponges". But I don't care.

The game is short, but sweet.  If you are a completionist, then this game also has acheivments that increases the replay value.   Here's a small tip:  ditch the shield and dual wield swords.  If you look hard enough, you'll earn enough gold to purchase 2 bronze swords right from the beginning.  Then slash both swords from left to right.

Using the sword to parry strikes feels even more awesome.\n\nAs soon as you get used to the sword and shield, you are given a bow, and it is equally fun learning to use.

So yes I want it to be longer, and the inventory system needs work.  (I couldn't figure out how to drop something unless I put it in my inventory, so every time I would want my pick axe or torch I had to keep going through cheese and a bunch of apples I picked up to look at)\nHowever, the core of this game is really fun and I really like the art style, world design, and lore that has started to be developed.  I was sad when I finished this because I wanted more.\n\nIf people are complaining that they can just teleport almost inside, and the waggle the sword around then I feel like that is one them for now.  Hopefully the enemies will be pushed back in the future.  For now, you can just teleport in front of them and then trade blows, blocks, and dodges the way it was intended to be played.  At one point near the end when it gets kind of hectic, I accidentally grabbed my old sword instead of my shield.  I didn't have enough time to switch back so I was duel wielding swords for awhile, and that was a lot of fun trying to move around and strike twice every time I saw an opening.\n\nThe auto pause was a little annoying at first.

The motion controls fail every now and then, resulting in your sword just whiffing through an enemy, but the rest of the time when they do work it's loads of fun parrying attacks and deflecting arrows by doing more than just the waggling we've long associated "motion control sword fighting" with. It's not perfect - the bow and arrow, while functional, isn't really as fun to use as the ones in The Lab or Spellfighter because the arrow is automatically straighened instead of angling as you move your hand, and the inventory belt can be hard to use to grab a potion in the middle of a fight because it seems to rotate based on where you're positioned, but Vanishing Realms is still a lot of fun and one of my favorite VR games.","April 28","true","2.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

There hasn't been a single moment where I felt uncomfortable or disoriented in the time I have played.\n\nThe combat is a little slow paced but I suppose it is for the better after trying other games that had fast paced combat which can make you feel uncomfortable and outright dangerous if designed wrong especially when fights get so intense that you forget about your chaperone bounds.\n\nThe cable you are tethered to also hampers your movement so I can't move quickly comfortably because I am always worried about tripping over the wire or smacking into a wall despite the chaperone warning which is often neglected in really heated moments. So I find it good that this game took a slower paced approach.\n\nBut the combat was far from snail paced, It was quite entertaining dueling with archers and sword skeletons, trading steel and arrows, dodging and blocking, and taking cover.\n\nThe AI though not the smartest in the world somehow seemed to react to my actions, sword fighters sometimes try to pull a fient on you dodging your attacks and swiftly counterattacking for instance. If you try to cheese the game with a bow from a distance eventually your foes start to dodge them.\n\nThe foes seem to have a set distance at which they will engage you, the fights are a little slower paced which I don't mind since you have time to plan your next move and don't run out of space as easily.\n\nI found the level design to be nice and clever but far from flawless, there were some places where I felt a disconnect. For instance trying to telport from a ledge to an archer that has been harassing me but it would only allow me to teleport to this one specific little spot on the ground without any visual cues so I was sitting there for ages figuring out how to get there.\n\nI found the inventory system to be quite intuitive, though sometimes it sticks out like a sore thumb when interacting with objects beneath you.\n\nThe art style was beautiful despite the simple cartoony looking graphics. Looks pretty good in VR, I loved the god rays coming out of the windows early on in the game. The skyboxes can use some work though.\n\nThe puzzles I've encountered so far are nice, but very short and simple.\n\nIt is good that the developer added some measures against cheesing the game, like abusing your available space to access areas you should not be able to otherwise.\n\nAll in all, I would really recommend this game, it is worth a try even if you don't happen to like RPGs.","May 6","true","3.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The combat is simple enough to get a hang of but not without some strategy.

Dragon wand is your win button.\n\nI'm working with a 2m x 2m play space, and while the combat can get a bit claustrophobic, the teleport feature can be used to great effect.

You gave this game some love and it shows!\nIn simple terms; this game is fun!  It's a bit short, but I'm hoping for more content in the future.\nIt's the little things that stand out for me in this game. They make you feel as if you are actually holding a shield and a sword (or bow and arrow, etc). It really stands out when you compare it to some others like it; yes, you can just wave your sword around, but you can also actually use it!  On the last level, I was getting really good at going around their shields (or under or over) to kill in very few strokes.  The map accuracy for the bows and arrows were surprisingly accurate, allowing for hiding behind cover, aiming without looking (stretch the arms around the corner), dodging incoming arrows, and, for the slow, looking down at the arrows sticking out of you!  LOL, AND they move faithfully when you do, persisting long enough to be disconcerting!\nI have now been spoiled; games that don't allow me to clash my sword on my shield really suck!\nThe maps were also imaginative and fun, keeping you thinking and on your toes!\nI LOVED the inventory management in this one!  I had a bit of a problem with losing items in between saves, but nothing that mattered (which is probably why they disappeared).

Maybe I am spoiled by games like Dragon Age: Inquisition, where after 120 hours of gameplay, I am not even close to done playing? And I picked that up for $30. Here, I am paying $20 for two hours of entertainment, so it doesn't quite add up no matter how good it is.\n\nWith that aside, what you do get to experience in those 2 hours is quite good. It is definitely cool to fight the skeletons, especially when dual wielding two swords, even though the fights are a little slow and clunky with so-so collision detection. I can see this maybe becoming a little more worth the price if a few bonus or side quests are added, along with a separately selected arena with leader boards. In a game that already has a bow and arrow, swords, a shield, and a magic wand, the possibilities for mini-games are endless.\n\nAdd that extra content, and I would fully recommend this game as a worthwhile $20 investment, but as it is now, I feel a bit slighted, and would not have paid more than $8-$10. It is also interesting to note that since the game takes just over 2 hours to complete, it takes you just past the 2 hour game time limit for returns, and then ends - that seems like a little more than a coincidence to me, but it is mentioned in the description, so it's not like it's a shock when it ends and you are left upset that there isn't more. But that right there is the important part - I was left wanting more.\n\nI didn't give this game a thumbs down because it is a bad game, I gave it a thumbs down because it is currently rather over-priced. I hope that will change as development continues, and if it does, I will try to remember to update my review/recommendation.","May 26","false","2.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Playing this with the Vive versus looking at screenshots just does not do it justice. I was enjoying it so much I was unable to stop playing this until the game told me I was done, it's that good. It's definitely my favorite Vive game I've played so far.\n\nWhat I loved:\n- Great sense of immersion\n- Great style\n- Writing (on pieces of paper throughout the game) was pretty entertaining to think about the meanings of and well written\n- Little touches - things like drawing the bow string back and getting a haptic tension feeling in the controller\n\nThings that I think could improve or at least considered by the devs:\n- Combat\nI didn't dislike the swordplay and shield stuff, but I felt like I was flailing a bit more than I would have liked to or felt immersive. I couldn't quite learn what was working against the enemies other than sheer flailing. I could get a cut around the head on the base skeleton warrior guys, but it was hard to replicate it time after time. Sometime I would get blocked. Using the bow and arrow was awesome and, when I was in a bind, would usually be a reliable strategy. Still I would love to be able to feel like I was a master of the swordplay.\n\nI was also wondering what sort of assumptions were made in the way the skeleton characters block that would be advantageous or disadvantageous to either a left or right handed player. I'm not sure if it makes sense, but maybe have skeletons that are left or right handed so there's a chance to even that playing field a tad.\n\n- User interface\nIt would be great if there's an option to choose a left-handed inventory "belt" layout. As a lefty I was picking things up frequently with my left hand, but having to reach across my body to the end slot to put an item away. I'm a pretty skinny person, but sometimes reaching and looking would cause the "belt" UI to shift over to the right on me, making it a bit more tedious to put the item away than it already was. It would be great as a lefty to just be able to put things away without having to stare too much at the slot.\n\n- Multiple item "belt" user interface\nIf a slot on the belt contains more than one item, maybe experiment with implementing a mechanic where the user can twist the controller once they've activated a slot and then twisting would cycle backwards or forwards through the items in that slot. Another option might be to show the items in some sort of list that pops out once you've activated that slot and moving the controller up or down moves through the items (only a few around the current one are shown)\n\nAll of those things said, I have to say this is the highlight game for me thus far on the Vive.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Krios47/recommended/322770/","Krios47","Krios47","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Krios47/","109 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFirst off I just wanna start by saying that this is very impressive for a solo developer to have made this game. Also, this game has a lot of great things going for it and a lot of potential to be a fully fleshed out, exciting game. The environments and interactivity in the game really shine in VR.\n\nHowever, there are just a few issues with this title that detracted me from actually enjoying the game. The biggest problem I had was with the teleporting. There absolutely needs to be a cooldown on the teleport and either disengage entirely during close combat or have greater restrictions on the frequency of use as well as the distance you can travel. I blazed through a large portion of the game beating the first boss and teleported to the new area while only getting touched maybe twice. I personally would think some kind of magic wand/staff that is used specifically for teleporting would be a decent solution. That way you can't teleport out of the way from arrows instantly while using the bow and it would restrict your combat. If it also took a bit of time to travel distances (say by shooting out an orb) that would be even better.\n\nTwo other issues I had were with the inventory system. It works but there is room for improvement. For one, if you want to get an item out of your bag you need to cycle through repeatedly until you get the one you want. It would work much better if you could actually open up your bag kind of like The Gallery, look through and grab the item you want. The other thing is there should be a way to drop certain items. I made the mistake of retaking a used key after opening a door thinking it might unlock others. Afterwards I couldn't ever drop it and it had to take up a useless slot in my inventory.\n\nAlso, this may be a bit nitpicky and isn't necessary to implement but close quarters combat could use some improvement. The opponents have maybe 3 animations of melee attacks, all of which are of a single strike. It would be preferable for different enemies to have different animations and even string certain combos together plus have some unpredictability. I know this would take a lot of work and this is early access so I can't harp too much about the combat for what it is right now. But for this game to be a feature rich game it has some work to be done.\n\nFinally, it would be nice to have different difficulty settings. The game was way too easy and there were a few exploits that can be done. To name a couple: using a sword to stab skeletons in the face when they approach you (even with their shields raised), or using the bow and instantly teleporting out of danger and repeatedly fire off arrows.\n\nI will gladly come back to this game after some updates, as I said it has a lot of potential to be one of the best titles out on the vive. Exploring the landscapes and finding enough hidden treasures to eventually buy better equipment was a lot of fun. However, as it stands now I just can't recommend it while there are still a few problems that need to be addressed.","April 24","false","0.8"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","2"

Other developers would do well to study this game very closely.\n\nThe interactions with the world are so well implemented that this provides the deepest sense of presence that I've felt in a VR game. I was giddy and had a ridiculous grin on my face the first time I found a pickaxe and started wailing on ore deposits. Just holding a torch is a simple joy and illustrates what a massive difference a simple little thing like holding a light source in your hand and moving it around to move things in and out of shadow can have on immersion.\n\nThe visuals are cartoony but still impressive and a pleasure to look at. I'd love to see a more realistic rendering of this world in VR, but I am by no means complaining. The world is lovely.\n\nThe combat is great too. The mix of ranged and melee combat gives you a nice variety. There's nothing quite like standing up against multiple opponents with your sword and shield in hand, trying to deflect and counter their rain of blows.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fuzzfinger/recommended/322770/","fuzzfinger","Fuzzfinger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fuzzfinger/","117 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI have just started playing through Vanishing Realms for the second time, this time I am recording my adventure and thoughts as I go along https://youtu.be/hL1XfwmHstE\n\nIt is kind of true that the game is short, and I am still sort of confused as to how future content is going to be pushed through (ie as free updates or as new paid for episodes). However, since VR is new and has limited users its completely understandable why games such as this, which have a cost associated with them only last two to three hours. The developers have to price their games in a way that will bring them a return when sales will be lower than the general PC market. Got it.\n\nThat said, the couple of hourse of gameplay that are available with Vanishing Realms are a heck of a lot of fun. I often felt like I was playing the role Indiana Jones and the environments are absoluetly stunning in VR.\n\nHowever, it is the room scale that really pushes the bar high. Being able to stroll around your own little space, lighting torches, peering over edges and looking through windows provides a gaming experience that I have simply never come close to having before. That isn't to say it is the best gaming I have ever had, it isn't; but it is so radically different to everything I have done before that comparing Vanishing Realms to any stadard monitor driven game would be like comparing apples and oranges.\n\nSo, Vanishing Realms is short but awesomely entertaining.\n\nThe combat is also very done. I generally don't emjoy first person combat games. Call of Duty? No thanks, not for me. However, even though this is technically a first person RPG, I wouldn't have it any other way. If this is a taste of things to come, then I can safely say that the first person gaming was simply made for VR... it just started out a few years before the tech :) Having a skeleton stand right in front of you hammering his rusty blade in your face can be genuinely intimidating. However, being able to lift your own sword (not a mouse/keyboard but an actual physical object in your hand that is perfectly tracked) in order to parry those attacks and then being able to thrust it into it's head to deplete its health is incredibly satisfying.\n\nSadly, there is a slight negative because things turn a little bit less satisfying once you have equipped the bow and arrow. You see, the AI is not particularly good, and as long as you stay at a distance you can spam your arrows to kill the enemies and they won't even move towards you. They can strafe a little from time to time but as soon as I had the bow all the danger became almost completely inert and that was a real shame. In the end I just put the bow away and only used it when absolutely necessary, ie if enemies could not be reached via melee, but it seems like a silly thing to have to do to get the most enjoyment out of the game.\n\nThat said, I highly recommend Vanishing Realms to anybody who has a Vive. Feel free to watch my video (linked at the start of my review) for a general idea of what the game is about, but this won't even begin to give you a taster of the actual experience. The game is great, so I thank the developer for their efforts and I can't wait to see what will be coming next!\n\nFuzz","May 21","true","2.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fuzzfinger/recommended/322770/","fuzzfinger","Fuzzfinger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fuzzfinger/","117 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI have just started playing through Vanishing Realms for the second time, this time I am recording my adventure and thoughts as I go along https://youtu.be/hL1XfwmHstE\n\nIt is kind of true that the game is short, and I am still sort of confused as to how future content is going to be pushed through (ie as free updates or as new paid for episodes). However, since VR is new and has limited users its completely understandable why games such as this, which have a cost associated with them only last two to three hours. The developers have to price their games in a way that will bring them a return when sales will be lower than the general PC market. Got it.\n\nThat said, the couple of hourse of gameplay that are available with Vanishing Realms are a heck of a lot of fun. I often felt like I was playing the role Indiana Jones and the environments are absoluetly stunning in VR.\n\nHowever, it is the room scale that really pushes the bar high. Being able to stroll around your own little space, lighting torches, peering over edges and looking through windows provides a gaming experience that I have simply never come close to having before. That isn't to say it is the best gaming I have ever had, it isn't; but it is so radically different to everything I have done before that comparing Vanishing Realms to any stadard monitor driven game would be like comparing apples and oranges.\n\nSo, Vanishing Realms is short but awesomely entertaining.\n\nThe combat is also very done. I generally don't emjoy first person combat games. Call of Duty? No thanks, not for me. However, even though this is technically a first person RPG, I wouldn't have it any other way. If this is a taste of things to come, then I can safely say that the first person gaming was simply made for VR... it just started out a few years before the tech :) Having a skeleton stand right in front of you hammering his rusty blade in your face can be genuinely intimidating. However, being able to lift your own sword (not a mouse/keyboard but an actual physical object in your hand that is perfectly tracked) in order to parry those attacks and then being able to thrust it into it's head to deplete its health is incredibly satisfying.\n\nSadly, there is a slight negative because things turn a little bit less satisfying once you have equipped the bow and arrow. You see, the AI is not particularly good, and as long as you stay at a distance you can spam your arrows to kill the enemies and they won't even move towards you. They can strafe a little from time to time but as soon as I had the bow all the danger became almost completely inert and that was a real shame. In the end I just put the bow away and only used it when absolutely necessary, ie if enemies could not be reached via melee, but it seems like a silly thing to have to do to get the most enjoyment out of the game.\n\nThat said, I highly recommend Vanishing Realms to anybody who has a Vive. Feel free to watch my video (linked at the start of my review) for a general idea of what the game is about, but this won't even begin to give you a taster of the actual experience. The game is great, so I thank the developer for their efforts and I can't wait to see what will be coming next!\n\nFuzz","May 21","true","2.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Looking around for that damn archer, then peering round shelter to shoot back? Fighting skeletons and having to actually use swordplay to bypass their shield? This game is for you. Yes it's only a couple of hours long, yes it's what some consider expensive, BUT consider a movie visit. By the time you've gone there, paid for your seat and drinks/food, and sat for a couple of hours, this is no more expensive. The best bit is, YOU are playing the hero, not someone on a screen. Being in the thick of the action, or creeping round the rocks and trees to sudenly get hit by an arrow from an unseen assailant feels so much more real. Looking around you in VR means you can imagine you are really there.\n\nFor me the whole experience was bug free, no slowdowns, judders, or glitches in the scenery.

There is no abstraction of the gameplay. No click this or that. No button smashing. Just do what you want. Grab the sword, block the attacks.

Look under the table or bend over to look inside the chest and grab the coins and treasures.\n\nParrying and hitting with the sword is satisfying, although the incoming attacks of the enemies are very predictable after some time.

Other developers would do well to study this game very closely.\n\nThe interactions with the world are so well implemented that this provides the deepest sense of presence that I've felt in a VR game. I was giddy and had a ridiculous grin on my face the first time I found a pickaxe and started wailing on ore deposits. Just holding a torch is a simple joy and illustrates what a massive difference a simple little thing like holding a light source in your hand and moving it around to move things in and out of shadow can have on immersion.\n\nThe visuals are cartoony but still impressive and a pleasure to look at. I'd love to see a more realistic rendering of this world in VR, but I am by no means complaining. The world is lovely.\n\nThe combat is great too. The mix of ranged and melee combat gives you a nice variety. There's nothing quite like standing up against multiple opponents with your sword and shield in hand, trying to deflect and counter their rain of blows.

While the artistic style is simple it works, the skeleton warriors loom over  you, there is a great visceral feel from banging your sword off your shield before engaging in combat.  There are light puzzle elements also, which helps round out the dungeon crawler experience.\n\nSo to keep this simple, would you like to play a dungeon crawler from first person, where your fighting skill was tied to literally how you moved and attacked in the real world? Like collecting loot and solving puzzles that are not too hard?\n\nIf so then give Vanishing Realms a try.\n\n1 Caveat: This game thrives off of having a larger play space, you sense of freedom, ability to fight and avoid traps is directly relational to how much size you have mapped out in the real world, you'll want enough space to fully swing your arms in any direction and be able to take a step in any direction without coming up against a real life wall.","June 3","true","0.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

All I can say is wow. Best. Experience. On Vive. If you like games like Legend of Zelda, Skyrim, or any high fantasy type property, you simply must own this game. You actually get to fight with sword and shield! It is incredibly fun to actually FIGHT, rather than "press a button to swing your sword. Press another button to raise your shield. Yay." kind of abstract gameplay that has been the best any computer or console could do up until now. Carefully swinging your sword and maneuvering it through your enemy's armor to get a hit to the vulnerable vitals within never, ever gets old, and the satisfaction of actually being the victor in combat is greater here than any game I've ever played in my life.\n\nThe best complement I can pay it is that I would LOVE for the game to be as big as Skyrim, and take me hundreds of hours to beat.

It is a must-play. It is not even finished and it is already completely amazing, worth the price it is charging and definitely a go-to demo for the true power of VR as a medium for storytelling and compelling gameplay. Get off the fence, come down here and buy this."\n\nThis is no tech demo and you can't even get a slight idea of what its like from the pictures and teaser video... this is meat on the bone single-player mystery/puzzle/action RPG. Its duration is short at the moment compared to AAA titles, but it is early access and still well worth the price. This game has the perfect all-around mix of mechanics, story, artistic flare and mystery to bring you fully into another world. The words to describe the experience would be things like, stupendous, rewarding, enthralling, memorable, thought-provoking.\n\nI've played games like this before...and from an abstracted point of view, everything in Vanishing Realms has been done before, but you've NEVER done what you do in Vanishing Realms. If you played Spell Fighter-- that was a taste, but this is the whole bite. It has the hallmarks of a good RPG game but this time YOU do it for real. Every sword swing is your own. You can cast magic and its not some autotargeting system..if you don't point your wand correctly your spell will fly off and sputter doing nothing. When you pull the bowstring on your bow and let it go...you better aim true.\n\nYou'll find yourself crouching or sitting down after a battle, panting while you put virtual food to your face to gain health and mana.\nYou'll be dueling mortal combat with larger-than-life monsters, trading blows, parrying and ducking around your playspace to dodge.\nYou'll curse and swear and fight with all your strength as you realize monsters don't play fair, or wait in line to kill you.\nYou'll hide behind a virtual rock for cover as a wizard casts wicked magic your way.\nYou'll parry arrow shots inches from your body with expert timing using just your sword.\nYou'll search every nook and cranny for secrets, hidden loot, questionable keys and forgotten treasures.\n\nYou'll be completely blown away by this game.","April 30","true","5.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game takes VR to the next level. I've owned the Oculus Rift DK1 and DK2, and just got the Vive today. I was totally unprepared for how immersive this game would be.\n\nThere are different weapons to purchase, loot hidden all over the place, real physical combat including dodging, blocking, and landing blows. All of this is handled via the motion controllers, and it's implemented very well.\n\nThe environments are beautiful, the enemies have personality and artistic beauty, the sound is good.

Vanishing Realms is the reason I'm hyped for VR and the future of gaming. I bought the Vive and tried out games like Space Pirate Trainer and Audioshield and was very impressed. Then I bought Vanishing Realms and was completely blown away.\n\nIt really does remind me of my early days of dungeon crawling in Elder Scrolls: Arena. I take it back that far because I know this is the beginning of VR gaming and Arena introduced me to dungeon crawling / RPGs along with Betrayal at Krondor and the like.\n\nVanishing Realms is an awesome, colorful, immersive and totally amazing game and I really hope we continue to see more out of not only this game, but others like it that build on this style of VR play. I know Oculus Touch is coming, but being able to experience this game in room-scale VR on the Vive confirmed my choice of headset so much so that I canceled my Rift order.","April 29","true","3.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I wish there was a greater feeling of weight to swinging the sword. Obviously design choices were made, but I'd rather not see virtual objects ever 'go through' other virtual objects even if it means disassociating the held object with your actual hand. In Job Simulator for instance, if you hold a mug and put your hand through a table the mug is stopped by the table and your hand continues through. Not only should your sword be physically blocked by an enemy shield but there should be a momentum calculation as well. One of the primary differences of the Vive from the Wii is that the controllers are tracked 1:1, real momentum calculations are possible; otherwise the combat will just feel gimmicky.\n\nAnother criticism would be the dreadful inventory system which the developer has already said he is going address.\n\nThe environments look great and feel great in VR. There is so much here you won't find in any other VR game currently available. The developer has nailed a few core elements that make it fun and satisfying.\n\nIt's worth picking up.","April 19","true","3.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a basic action RPG, but the VIVE really adds never before experienced elements. I wish it were longer!\n\nSome issues I have are:\n\n- Not an intuitive way to cycle through inventory, unless I am missing something. I'd be great to see a visual list and choose exactly what I want\n- Combat feedback consistency. I share the comments of someone else. It was hard to know sometimes if I was engaging in combat effectively. Hits that would register once would then be blocked. Or blocks that worked once would fail.\n- It's easy to move around a lot during a battle, and its a little to easy to get out of the games tracking focus. Would be great if it could be a little more forgiving with room scale movement\n\nOther than that, I think this game sells the Vive better than anything out there currently. It is a gamer's game. It is fully baked. And it's pure joy being able to explore a new world. I want WoW or Elder Scrolls level of world and detail next!

That being said, this game is amazing. If you ever wanted to feel like you have been thrown into a Zelda game(literally), this is the game for you. Yes it is in early access and yes there are some minor issues like inventory management. But the came had way too many pros for such minor details to stop me. I played all of the Early Access content in one sitting, probably not a good idea, but I was addicted. It was one of the most immersive games in VR I have played so far. I didn't want to leave! Anyways here are some of the Pros and Cons I experienced, it may not be the same for everybody.\n\nPros++++++\n-Immersive gameplay\n- You get to hack and slash your enemies( or disintegrate them with fire!)\n- Different weapons to suit your gamestyle(Archer, Knight, and Mage all mixed into one person)\n- Fun exploration and beautiful artwork/surroundings\n- A little bit of puzzle solving but nothing difficult\n- You feel like you are actually wielding whatever weapon you choose!\n- Some fun trap elements\n- Addicting( I don't know if this is a pro or con)\n- Some fun mini-boss and boss battles\n\nCons- - - - - (take lightly, it is still early access)\n- Inventory system can be annoying. I wanted to navigate back to my torch but since I picked up practically everything I saw I had to spam my inventory until the correct item appeared.\n- You need an ample amount of space of at least 2m x 2m.( not a problem for me, but could be for those with small areas)\n- Not much else when it comes to cons.\n\nPersonal recommendation:  I wish some of the puzzles were a little more difficult to really add a challenge! (Again, still early access)\n\nWell all things aside I do recommend this game for those that love the dungeon crawling and puzzle solving games. Or in other words, if you liked Zelda, you will like this game. It is only a few hours of content, but this is a game I want to support.

Ignore the "early access" label -- you will get a complete (albeit short: 2 hours) game for the price.\n\nWhat makes this cartoony dungeon crawler special is the combat: Wield your controller as a sword! Parry attacks! Lunge! Chop! Once you get a shield you can parry and lunge at the same time! Use a bow and arrow (like in The Lab)! Switch between them! Yay!\n\nSome "early access" things do come up. They are not bugs that keep you from playing, but they are things that can improve: Combat is too easy once you understand it. The enemies, even the bosses, barely fight back, and definitely don't know how to move around intelligently. I think the teleporting motion is very good compared to other VR games, but it can definitely be tweaked to allow for a more satisfying (and creepy) sense of exploration and travel, and of course to make combat more exciting than it is right now. Finally, 2 hours is not enough! By the time I got enough gold to get the cool weapons, the game was over! It would be fun to have more puzzles that would require you to retrace your steps and get to know the world more intimately.\n\nBut these seem like nitpicks. All in all Vanishing Realms is a wonderful place from which to see the promising VR RPG future.\n\nIf only for labeling this "early access" Indimo Labs deserves a lot of credit. 90% of the "full" releases on SteamVR right now are buggy, incomplete, half-baked experiments. It's deceitful to sell them at any price.

You really feel like you're there.\nGraphics and lighting effects look great.\nGUI and inventory managment is relatively fluid.\nDifferent weapons and equipment keeps the game interesting as you progress.\nAuto pause when you are about to hit bounds is a life-saver. (You can also turn it off if it annoys you.)\nProbably the most immersed I've been in VR so far. A must-have in my opinion.\nNeutral:If you're not in atleast a 3m by 3m area you're going to be triggering bounds a lot. You can definetly play in a smaller area, but you're going to be teleporting a lot. Which might kill immersion for some people. Game is best enjoyed in a huge area (5m x 5m), where you can really immerse yourself. Walking around and fighting enemies like you mean it.\n2 hours just doesn't feel like enough once you finish it. That being said it is on par or better than most VR titles in the cost/playtime department.\nCons:Enemy AI is pretty dumb. Even in boss fights, you can just teleport right next to a boss and bash their face in. They won't be able to hit you. Unless you're in melee 3v1 you won't really be challenged.\nNot much story to speak of. Usually lore is dropped through in-game scrolls and books, but there isn't much of an attempt at a coherent storyline. Especially in the second half of the episode, where you pop from place to place, even doing a gladitorial arena, with little to no explanation.\nAdditional graphics options, and optional higher res textures would be welcome.","May 31","true","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Ignore the "early access" label -- you will get a complete (albeit short: 2 hours) game for the price.\n\nWhat makes this cartoony dungeon crawler special is the combat: Wield your controller as a sword! Parry attacks! Lunge! Chop! Once you get a shield you can parry and lunge at the same time! Use a bow and arrow (like in The Lab)! Switch between them! Yay!\n\nSome "early access" things do come up. They are not bugs that keep you from playing, but they are things that can improve: Combat is too easy once you understand it. The enemies, even the bosses, barely fight back, and definitely don't know how to move around intelligently. I think the teleporting motion is very good compared to other VR games, but it can definitely be tweaked to allow for a more satisfying (and creepy) sense of exploration and travel, and of course to make combat more exciting than it is right now. Finally, 2 hours is not enough! By the time I got enough gold to get the cool weapons, the game was over! It would be fun to have more puzzles that would require you to retrace your steps and get to know the world more intimately.\n\nBut these seem like nitpicks. All in all Vanishing Realms is a wonderful place from which to see the promising VR RPG future.\n\nIf only for labeling this "early access" Indimo Labs deserves a lot of credit. 90% of the "full" releases on SteamVR right now are buggy, incomplete, half-baked experiments. It's deceitful to sell them at any price. But Indimo knows that the fact that VR is new doesn't mean people shouldn't get a complete, working, tested game, and is willing to risk lower sales by using the truthful "early access" label.

I had a blast playing through it. Exploring was nice, and once you achieve some of the objectives it gives a nice and satisfying feeling.\n\nAlso make sure to respect and know your chaperone bounds, especially early on in the game when you're not used to the combat yet. Only stab when you're sure you have enough room :D. I didn't have any accidents, but there were a few close calls where I nearly punched a chaperone wall.\n\nI'd like to see some more refinement on the combat, though. It's great for a first iteration, but I feel that there's some room for improvement. Larger enemies are immersion breaking for me since you need to get close to them to whack them, but then you have non-existant collision and clipping. And their attacks also make no sense then. Also, in general, blocking works well, but attacking feels off. You don't need finesse for some enemies, just randomly flail around and you're guaranteed to get some hits in.\n\nOh and I love the AI sometimes. When using a bow and arrow, they eventually start dodging your arrows, and at one point they just put their guard up so it's hard to get an arrow in. A great way to deal with cheese. Speaking of archery, right now aiming is done purely with the bow hand.

It gave me the most "wow's" and "holy ♥♥♥♥" moments of anything so far, the only rival being Budget Cuts demo (and that's about 10 minutes long once you're good).  The fact that an experience this nice was released on launch day gives me very high hopes for the future.  The devs have a ways to go to turn this into a fully fledged game (the sort of thing you expect to pay 50 bucks for), but the pieces are here for something awesome.\n\nKnow this: it's short.  Probably about 2 hours of play time.  But it's worth it.  It's a complete proof of concept for a fantasy game where you are sword fighting, killing enemies, looting and exploring.

After I played the two available chapters in Vanishing Realms, it became my favorite VR experience so far. The scale of the first chapter is great and going around the cave and then the open world was great.\n\nWhat I really liked about Vanishing Realms was the combat and the way in which the inventory/UI is handled. The combat is crazy satisfying as you go against enemies looking for their attacks to block/parry but then you're also looking for their opennings that you can then strike. Every fight and every kill I got felt satisfying and deserved.\n\nAs for the UI and inventory system, it is really simple and gets the job done. The UI is mostly minamalistic in that when you are looking out normally, you see no UI blocking your view. Everything UI is down below at your waist. When of your stats change (health, mana, or gold) they do pop up into your view but slowly lower back down to your waist. This system is perfect. Then for the gear and weapons you have, there's two 'backpacks', on on the left and right. This allows you to put things like keys, torches, food, potions, etc... in the backpack of the hand you will likely use. Torches and keys I would use in the left, but food and potions which I would need fast in combat were placed in my right pack so that my dominant hand could easily and quickly get to them. Between to two packs are your weapons devided into categories of one-handed melee, ranged-bow, and ranged-wand, and also the shield spot. Getting into fights and having to alternate between the weapons and gear was really simple and I never struggled to fight the way I wanted to in any engagement.\n\nIf you own a Vive, you need to play this first-person, Zelda style game.\n\n5/5","May 23","true","1.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You get actually, physically fight monsters, the game is an absolute blast. The game isn’t without issue however.\n\nThe current implementation of teleportation is not as good as it could be. Adding an indication of where you are in your play space, similar to how The Lab handles it would be a great improvement. This wouldn’t change where you are and aren’t allowed to go; it just reduces the mental acrobats you need to go through in order to get where you want to go if you need to interact with an object. Not being able to drop objects is jarring. Yes, you need almost every item you are carrying, but sometimes I don’t want five apples on me when I’m looking for a torch or my pickaxe. The grip buttons aren’t used for anything currently, there’s your use. If the player drops a key object, maybe make the object flash, or give some other indication showing that they may need it. Overall the inventory could use some work, I don’t like having to cycle through my swords, just to get to the one I want.\n\nCombat is extremely entertaining, but as my friend discovered, you can win your fights by “Skyward Sword-ing” your way through them. Near the end of the game, he was just waggling his sword back and forth in the enemies’ hitbox, effectively stunlocking them and turning the fights into a joke. That said, if you fight how you would expect to handle a sword and shield, the combat feels awesome. The choice of giving the play a sword first instead of a shield feels odd. From what I’ve seen, the average player doesn’t try to parry until they are told they can, and that makes the first few fights very panicked. Possibly introducing the shield first, and having the players defend against arrows before being given a weapon would introduce the combat better. I’d love to be able to shield bash my enemies, maybe not doing much (if any) damage, but being able to stagger them would be nice. The magic staff, while useful for massive damage and an AOE attack, just doesn’t feel good to use, it shoots it’s fireball in a disappointingly short arc, and doesn’t have much sensation on use.\n\nThe AI isn’t the most advanced in the world but it does try to prevent you from performing the same combinations against it. After a few similar moves, the enemies will dodge your attacks or try to block them, and forces you to try a different attack angle or method. The giant skeleton enemies downward attack also seems like it might not be working as intended, where if the player is within range to be able to hit the giant, the monster’s attack never seems to connect, since the end of the flail lands so far behind the player. All of that said, Vanishing Realms is an absolute delight to play, the environments are varied enough that you know generally where you are in the world. Although the first map is actually quite small if you are racing through it and the second is just the same arena nine times.\n\nSince the game is in early access at the time of writing (April 9, 2016) I expect that the game will grow more over time, and the majority of its issues to get dealt with.","April 9","true","4.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

About 25 minutes into Gallery, I had to stop and request a refund....it feels bored to me walking around exploring looking at things solving puzzles are not my thing I guess. Maybe I don't like adventure games.  Then I play Vanishing Realms, holy ♥♥♥♥...this game put me in a beautiful place where I actually really feel I am walking in that world.  It reminds me of Zelda except that you're actually there and not looking at the 2d screen. The teleportation is perfect....it's easy and quick and intuitive.  I didn't like the one in Gallery's...I know there is an option to change it but i didn't bother.  Vanishing Realm's teleportation should be used as a default for EVERY VR game!! It is that good along with Budget's Cut.  I love the magic, text, words, voices of Vanishing Realm, they're engaging. When i picked up the sword, it brought a smile to my face...i am ACTUALLY holding a freaking sword!  I am now ready to beat someone up.  And when i picked up the shield....I feel more than ready for combat.  I begin to search and the first battle with the skeleton was mesmerizing...holy ♥♥♥♥, it's huge.  I feel overwelmed but safe because I have my sword and shield. This is no gimmick folks. Your skills in battle is based on your skills in real life lol.  It was intense and I was so into it that I even hit the wall.  I'm losing my mind. I have 15x15 space and it feels so good to get that bit of space.  I imagine people that have less space might feel frustrated because even I wish I have more space.  So those are the positives i have about the game.  I don't have negatives.\n\nI do wish they have a saving system though,  I don't how you save the game?  You can pause the game but there is no option to save and I don't know if i lose the progress or not.\n\nAnother thing i wish improvement is object collision.  I wish every objects in the world I hit with the sword make that collision sound.  It just feel satisfying to hit things with your sword.  If i drag the sword on the concrete, it should give me that feeling of how sword behaves in real life....with perhaps spark flying.  Anyway, these are just suggestions.  This game is bar-none, a top VR game I ever played so far on VIVE and I played many of them.","April 9","true","5.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

With vanishing realms we are given a very short taste of what a virtual first person RPG could be like. You will explore, collect loot, unlock doors and fight monsters and that's pretty much it. I completed all the content available in about 100 minutes and by the end of it I would say that yes I had a good time. If you are desperate to play something on your new VR headset you can do worse than this game but be warned this title has more in common with an amusement park ride than an epic RPG. Chances are if you had enough money to buy a VR headset then the 19.99 asking price isnt outside your realm of affordability just don't go in expecting allot of bang for your buck.","May 16","true","2.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Every game should work like this.\n\nThe bad:\n(I like to complain so this is much larger than the "Good" section, but shouldn't be considered to outweigh the good)\n*Gameplay isn't balanced. There isn't enough variety between the weapons - the two bows both do 5 damage, the medium sword and the hammer both do 6 damage, the hammer doesn't work any differently than the sword. Enemies have an aggro range of about 3 feet and you can skip entire battles by standing out of aggro range and blasting away with your ranged weapons. When you're actually in melee range, the enemies crowd you too much; one of those skeleton soldiers fills up your entire screen and makes you constantly want to back up.\n*Combat is too simple when you're fighting only one enemy but completely overwhelming and unmanageable when you're fighting 3 enemies, partially because the enemies are so bulky you can only watch one at a time\n*Not enough enemy attack animations. The skeleton soldier is the main enemy you encounter and only has two or three animations. After you get used to the timing of its main attack, you get a brief period of feeling badass and then combat starts to go stale.\n*There are no consequences for death. You respawn 10 feet away with your inventory intact and the enemies still wounded. This is probably because the gameplay isn't balanced.\n*Store assets - the same skeleton soldier also appears in Legend of Luca, which must mean it was bought from the Unity asset store or a third-party asset store. Not inherently bad, but gamers can grow sick of models if they start popping up in multiple games\n*Inventory system is buggy, clunky, and impossible to use in combat. Once a fight starts, the only way you can switch weapons is to teleport far away from the fight, which feels like cheating\n*Only 2 - 3 hours of gameplay depending on how much you rush and how much you get lost\n*Save system is minimalistic - it saves your inventory and your position but not your progress. Enemies and obstacles respawn if you quit the game and load up your save again\n*No way to return to the menu without quitting the game. C'mon, this isn't the NES era...\n*The developer isn't active on the forum, which is bad form for an EA game. If you don't have a dialog with your customers, you're defeating the entire point of EA","May 25","true","3.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

The last part of the game (spoiler alert) is just repeated arena fights, perhaps added to pad out the length of the game so people will be less likely to get refunds.\n- Dull movement, besides room scale you can only teleport, and because it does not show you where your playspace will be in your prospective destination (like The Lab does), it makes movement frustrating.\n- Poor AI, understandable for an early VR game, but the enemies keep backing away, which means I have to keep teleporting close to them because my play space is only 2.5x2.5 meters, but the game sometimes prevents you from teleporting directly next to an enemy.  All in all it feels like enemy movement is working against the melee mechanics.\n- Bow is not fun.  It aims wherever your primary hand is pointing it, secondary hand is just used to pull back the arrow, making it feel unrealistic.\n- Lack of story, there are just a few cryptic messages guiding you around.  The game has little atmosphere and almost no personality.\n- Bad UI, you have to look down to check yout health, mana, gold, and inventory.  This combined with the small sweet spot on the Vive's lenses, makes it difficult to focus on the text.  Maybe it is better for people without glasses, I don't know.\n\nI really wanted to like this game based on it's reviews, but I found the gameplay to not be very fun, and it was only challenging when it was frustrating, such as fights against groups of enemies when you can't tell who is hitting you from where.  I was surprised at how soulless the game felt, I never felt there was a good reason for anything I was doing, just dungeon crawling for the sake of it, which once you get past the glitter of "it's in VR!" becomes boring fast.\n\nI will be eager to check out this game again once it has more updates and re-review it then, but as of now, I wish I had not bought it.","May 29","false","1.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I tested this game sitting down in a office desk chair and had to use my upper body to move. This game thankfully allows movement using the controller, teleporting you from one spot on the floor to another. You will need to have the HTC Vive in Room scaling mode to play this game and it was a bit of a challenge to play sitting down, but I will assure all the talking points will cover the universal approach and in no way will my reliability of a chair affect the opinion. That said, let us get to the main question. Is this RPG the grand attraction suited to introduce the functionality of the HTC Vive or is it another newcomer that might have gone on stage prematurely?\n\nThe dungeon and graveyard look astounding with a style similar to one of the latter Zelda games. Little cracks cover the walls and the wood bearings show off wear and tare. Skeletons are detailed beautifully with shields riddled with arrows and bruised dents in their armour. It really stood out the entire time I was playing it and I found myself more than once stopping to enjoy the atmosphere. It works very well to establish the mood, even if the actual inhabitants look more cartoonish than frightening. The music was a side note, painfully masked by the louder ambient noises of box hits, enemy strikes and arrow flings. I tried finding a way to change the volume, but I might have missed it.\n\nThe tutorial is a welcome feature and covers the basics such as moving and picking up items. The rest of the features are rather self explanatory except for maybe the wand usage which as of now can be annoying when you attempt to put it away only to blast yourself with it. Items range from health potions, torches, a pick axe, food and puzzle items. Gold, jewels, mana stones, ore (from mining) and chalices add to the currency system used to buy weapons and potions. There are also ruby chalices hidden throughout the dungeon to collect for an achievement, but it also provides gold and mana. It is simple enough to pick up items and the only issues with it are being close enough to reach, but with the teleport movement style I have not had an issue reaching anything. UI consists of slots that appear around your waist and include categories for weapons, potions, wand, bow and items. The item slot is a bit annoying when trying to grab certain items (have to go through each item until you get the one you need) and you cannot drop items. There is a limit to how many items you can carry so unless you stockpiled on fruits before grabbing the pick axe, you should be fine.\n\nCombat is a typical hack and slash standoff against skeletons and ghosts. As long as the enemy can see you and are in range, they will attempt to hit you as a group (space must be available to accommodate multiple melee so bottlenecking into a short gap is usually recommended). Weapons and a shield are either bought or found and weapons range from swords, bows (use off hand to pull back arrow), hammer or a wand (uses mana and you point, hold trigger and release). Dual wielding is possible as well as parrying to deal with melee hits, but the shield is crucial against arrows and moving is the only way to avoid fireballs. It is very simplistic in nature with the majority just being massive flailing of the controller, but it is recommended to time attacks and use movement to gain a upper hand. It can get very tiring during the fights later on. Death is not to harsh on the player at least.\n\nThe look and feel of the game cannot overcome the barren amount of content though. Going through the first level can take about 30-45 minutes if you are going slow and the arena style matches can keep that stretched to about an hour and fifteen. There is a total of 11 ruby chalices to collect and 33 ore spots to harvest for achievements, but all of this can be done in one pass if you look half-effort. It can be hard for some to make it the whole way in one play through with the forty plus monsters you so thankfully their is checkpoint saving, but if someone wants to play, they either start where you left off or erase the entire save and start from the beginning. Outside of this, there were some random moments I experienced missing frames and was kicked out of the game to the Vive menu (it started were I left off when I entered the app again).\n\nDuring my second play through, the game starting feeling like an endurance test over anything else. The simple wonder of discovering what was behind the next corner really helped keep the magic alive during the first play through. I still enjoyed the scenery, but when I already knew what to expect it just felt boring. With only about an hour of gameplay and little replay value, it is hard to recommend when other products have so much more meat on their bones. I am eager to see what happens next, but for now it would be better to wait until a few more chapters at least justify the entry price.\n\nPros\n\n- Beautiful aesthetic\n- Fluid controls and combat feedback\n\nCons\n\n- Very little content\n- Frame issues\n- Couple of UI issues (item sorting/selection, miss fires with wand)","April 26","false","1.5"," 10 of 23 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","10","23","0","0"

You can give it a try. /Note\n\nAfter much debate i'm leaning toward a 'No'.\n\nThis game is a wonderfull experience. It truly embodies the incredible potential of vive VR. ACTUALLY hiding behind a tree to shoot an enemy with your bow is beyond cool, and so is wielding your sword at it.\n\nBut it is also extremelly ugly. Like last decade ugly. It's subjective but the 'cartoon' design is a complete failure for me. As much as i like wandering in a virtual word, I hate that it must look like it's been designed for a 9 year old.\nPlease keep in mind that the vive's total resolution is less than that of a WQHD screen which is becoming the standard for gaming. There is no reason for a 2016 game to be so ugly.\n\nAlso if you were to play it on a flat screen, you wouldn't even look twice at the game. It's a very ordinary dungeon crawler with nothing much to it (disclaimer : i'm not done with the game yet, i may still have a pleasant surprise).\n\nCombine all this with the price tag for 2h worth of gaming, and you get a clear 'No' from me.\n\nThe only real reason you want to buy it is to funnel money toward VR, and have people create ACTUAL games for the plateforms.

Standing face to face with a skeleton is shocking. Wandering around dark dungeons gives a distinct feeling, like you stepped inside a Zelda game. It's worth trying out because it's unique, literally can't get this anywhere else. However, there are many design decisions I don't like. The inventory system is barbaric, getting a particular item is always frustrating. The UI bounces up / down to always stay visible even if you don't want to look at it. Grabbing loot is followed by an annoying chime and stupid UI circles right in your face. The game tries really hard to remind you it's just a game, rather then just letting you be in the world. The final combat sequence is a series of enemies that must be defeated inside a short time limit. This is a bad decision, it encourages you to break the already flaky combat system, Actually  blocking swords and striking when you have an oportunity will cause you to fail since it's so time consuming.\n\nAnother developer will probably do this better relatively soon.","May 22","false","4.4"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

Also can't drop picked up items which can be annoying). Combat is actually quite good, you can't just wildly swing and expect to hit, it's better to dodge/block and then strike. Only downside at the moment is the length of the game, but that's what I expected in Early Access.

Its brilliant and its fun.\n\nThere are two core problems with this game though.\nIts early access, and it shows. The game length is about an hour with no reason to replay it other than to relive the experience.\nIt's advertised as an RPG, however when I hear 'RPG' i think choices. There are no choices in this game, other than 'Should i spend my money on this item.' and 'How do I attack this skeleton.'. A leveling system, some sort of upgrade system, or even a few forks in the dungeon could go a long way in Vanishing Realms.\nI'm recommending this game because its still great, and it has tons of potential, but if you have a limited amount of cash to spend on VR games, hold off on this one until its had more time to grow.","April 10","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Like add a slider somewhere that lets you determine how fast mobs respawn.  Teleporting around a level looking for stuff will get people motion sick if it's not broken up with some combat here and there.  What would be EVEN BETTER, would be something like a marathon mode where you fight mobs back to back without having to worry about plot.

The visuals are gorgeous once you're inside of the game, and the use of roomscale is excellent if you have the room to move from different pieces of cover.  I had so much fun during the archer battles and ranged combat.\n\nThe melee combat is a little less satisfying but still overall a great deal of fun.  Like others have said sometimes the enemies end up getting to close to you and it makes combat slightly awkward, granted once you learn how to teleport around the battlefield like a boss this becomes much less of an issue.  My only gripe with the melee combat.....why isn't there vibration on the wand when your sword makes contact with something?  That seems like it should be natural, and it would go a long ways towards immersion.\n\nThe game is a bit on the short side, but it will make for an excellent demo game, and has proven to me that sword fighting can absolutely work (at least in single player) games with the Vive.  I was always confident that I could parry or block an attack that was coming without worrying about clipping, or feeling like my sword simply floats through the enemies.\n\n8/10 for now.  With more chapters and sword vibrations this could easily become a 9 or even 10/10.\n\n(seriously drinking potions? So badass.)","April 26","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are more enemy types than what is shown in the screenshots & video, and you also have ranged combat options in addition to sword and board. Travel beyond your chaperone area is done via short range "blink" type teleportation that works fine. There are occasional elements that leverage room-scale quite well, at one point I actually got on my hands and knees to get past a certain hazard & grab some treasure. The combat is a bit sloppy, but it's satisfying. At this point the inventory system isn't great, but the dev has posted indication that he has an improvement pending in the next patch.\n\nI recommend putting on some soft, 1 to 5 pound wrist weights to improve the feeling you get when playing.","April 26","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Very much reminiscent of Zelda on N64.  The teleport to move mechanic works flawlessly.  Atmosphere and gameplay are fun and enjoyable. I want to see a dozen more chapters!\n\nOne thing that bothered me was that unlike many other room-scale games Vanishing Realms has no feature which keeps your point of view primarily away from your computer monitor or television. During my entire playthrough of chapter 2 (since it follows more of a single direction of movement - unlike chapter 1's more roaming exploration) I was facing directly toward my monitor and there was nothing I could do about that. For that reason i'd classify this game as more dangerous to near-by displays than other titles.

I know I have. And Vanishing Realm made my dreams come true.\n\nMade by an ex-Valve dev (yes, singular), Vanishing Realm puts players into, quite literally, the boots of a lone adventurer, armed only with his/her wits and thirst for adventure. The cartoony nature of the game may seem like a mood breaker for some, but trust me when I say all these will go away once you hold the sword in your hand for the first time, or when you that huge skeleton swung its flail right above your head as you franctically ducked instinctively.\n\nThe battle was fluid and engaging, requiring players to parry, dodge and attack with good timing and precision. However, once you get used to the mechanics, it can get a little too easy, even in boss fights. The variety of weapons is also quite limited at this time as the game is still in early access.\n\nHowever, the potential of this game is huge and it could very well revolutionise dungeon crawling adventure games as Ocarina of Time did at the time of its release.

It's basically Zelda-light in VR. It has so many elements that are really good, but not perfect, though the combination of them in one game is great.\n\nSwordplay feels fantastic, parrying with a sword is just as fun as you could imagine, and blocking with a shield only to then stab the skeleton in between the armor and the shield like in 300 is crazy fun.\n\nThe loot system where you actually destroy things and then grab the loot is great, the new inventory system (essentially a belt) works pretty well, and is decently unobtrusive.\n\nThe other weapons that I won't spoil are OK, but could be better. The puzzles work pretty well, though the traps, while cool looking, didn't really seem to work for me with teleporting.\n\nOverall, this is a game with a lot of very cool elements. It makes me more excited for VR's potential than probably any other game I've played. As I said before, nothing is quite perfect... but everything is pretty good. The only real criticism is, of course, the length of the game. My play-time is inflated because 2 people have played it. It is somewhere shy of 2 hours long. It is an early access game, and the dev apparently is planning on adding another chapter. There is no doubt that this is a very cool game, and I don't regret getting it, but it would not be my first purchase.","May 6","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Very much reminiscent of Zelda on N64.  The teleport to move mechanic works flawlessly.  Atmosphere and gameplay are fun and enjoyable. I want to see a dozen more chapters!\n\nOne thing that bothered me was that unlike many other room-scale games Vanishing Realms has no feature which keeps your point of view primarily away from your computer monitor or television. During my entire playthrough of chapter 2 (since it follows more of a single direction of movement - unlike chapter 1's more roaming exploration) I was facing directly toward my monitor and there was nothing I could do about that. For that reason i'd classify this game as more dangerous to near-by displays than other titles. I had smacked my controllers into walls as well my monitor (which I had thankfully covered with a thick cardboard box for safety) during melee combat several times.

The inventory system felt clunky and I hated not being able to drop items.  You might have to click through all your misc items 20 times to find that torch you stashed after you've put 19 pieces of food there.

For a game which is Early Access that's pretty good in my book.\n\nThe combat is really fun.\n- The Bow + Arrow combo is well balanced but could be much better if Van. R. adapts the system from Valve's The Lab instead of the one they are using.\n- Hammer and Sword are cool but they could feel a bit more "round". Maybe add a bit of vibrations when hitting the enemy or something like that.\n- Shield is S-class, arrows pierce through a bit and give a super cool feeling. Not sure if there's vibrations actually. Was too immersed to really check that. It's just god damn statisfying learning the quirks and hits of every big dude and blocking the ♥♥♥♥ out of his strikes.\n- Wand is OGMWTFBBQ.\n\nGeneral movement is pretty well done, although the auto pause is a bit too agressive when pointing your sword through objects but that's not so bad and can be turned off.\n\nSome minor quirks with how far monsters "back off" when playing on a 2.5x2.5m roomscale but that's still not a big deal, short teleport and that is an interesting dynamic this way.\n\n","April 19","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also can't drop picked up items which can be annoying). Combat is actually quite good, you can't just wildly swing and expect to hit, it's better to dodge/block and then strike. Only downside at the moment is the length of the game, but that's what I expected in Early Access.

Its brilliant and its fun.\n\nThere are two core problems with this game though.\nIts early access, and it shows. The game length is about an hour with no reason to replay it other than to relive the experience.\nIt's advertised as an RPG, however when I hear 'RPG' i think choices. There are no choices in this game, other than 'Should i spend my money on this item.' and 'How do I attack this skeleton.'. A leveling system, some sort of upgrade system, or even a few forks in the dungeon could go a long way in Vanishing Realms.\nI'm recommending this game because its still great, and it has tons of potential, but if you have a limited amount of cash to spend on VR games, hold off on this one until its had more time to grow.","April 10","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Very much reminiscent of Zelda on N64.  The teleport to move mechanic works flawlessly.  Atmosphere and gameplay are fun and enjoyable. I want to see a dozen more chapters!\n\nOne thing that bothered me was that unlike many other room-scale games Vanishing Realms has no feature which keeps your point of view primarily away from your computer monitor or television. During my entire playthrough of chapter 2 (since it follows more of a single direction of movement - unlike chapter 1's more roaming exploration) I was facing directly toward my monitor and there was nothing I could do about that. For that reason i'd classify this game as more dangerous to near-by displays than other titles. I had smacked my controllers into walls as well my monitor (which I had thankfully covered with a thick cardboard box for safety) during melee combat several times. I play in a 8ft by 10.5ft play area. Many of the other games I've played will utilize the location of the monitor/computer in the room and set the default facing direction as away from the monitor.\n\nThe game takes about 2 hours to finish. That said I wouldn't consider the game worth its current price with its currently limited amount of content. To justify the price I believe the final product (after early access ends) should have have at least two or three times as much gameplay as what we can currently enjoy in the first two chapters. I mean paying $10 per hour for first play-through content is a little rediculous.\n\nI also felt that some of the game's design elements were created to keep the early access beyond Steam's 2 hour refund period. For example time-consuming use of a mining-pick to obtain gold (which is neccessary to proceed), as well as the cryptic hints on how to proceed to the end of each chapter or how to pass through certain doorways.","May 8","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's basically Zelda-light in VR. It has so many elements that are really good, but not perfect, though the combination of them in one game is great.\n\nSwordplay feels fantastic, parrying with a sword is just as fun as you could imagine, and blocking with a shield only to then stab the skeleton in between the armor and the shield like in 300 is crazy fun.\n\nThe loot system where you actually destroy things and then grab the loot is great, the new inventory system (essentially a belt) works pretty well, and is decently unobtrusive.\n\nThe other weapons that I won't spoil are OK, but could be better. The puzzles work pretty well, though the traps, while cool looking, didn't really seem to work for me with teleporting.\n\nOverall, this is a game with a lot of very cool elements. It makes me more excited for VR's potential than probably any other game I've played. As I said before, nothing is quite perfect... but everything is pretty good. The only real criticism is, of course, the length of the game. My play-time is inflated because 2 people have played it. It is somewhere shy of 2 hours long. It is an early access game, and the dev apparently is planning on adding another chapter. There is no doubt that this is a very cool game, and I don't regret getting it, but it would not be my first purchase.","May 6","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I felt like a total boss facing 3 Skeles at once, blocking thrusting, parrying, and ducking the big skeletons morning star and counter attacking is a truly epic feeling. The enemy AI could use some tweaking, as they tend to stand around until you get close. I do like that after a couple arrows to the face they start ducking and blocking.  One improvement my be a knockback for the bosses. I found that if I got really close there attacks didnt land.

Hell, it'll be my first review anywhere.\n\nThere's not much I can say that hasn't been, but I'll try anyway since I think devs need to see that their efforts are worthwhile and makeing a huge difference.\n\nI remember playing Legend of Zelda on NES as a kid.  I loved it so much I asked to go to the hardware store, bought a plank of wood, and went at trying to create my own shield. Epic fail, since my artistic and handicraft skills are subpar - at best. But it was the first spark of a decades long, insatiable quest to transport myself to another world and do the things that weren't possible.\n\nIt's been a long time since then, but for the first time ever, I feel like I've come close. This game is the promising first step in that journey. For those of us who have gotten Vive or are contemplating getting it, it's going to be a rough ride until something with Skyrim/Zelda production value comes out. But if you've even the slightest inclination to really feel like you're the hero in the game, this is the closest you can get at this time.\n\nPRO's:\n- Everything you could extrapolate from my introductory statements. You *are* the hero in this game. It's f-in' great.\n- Excellent swordplay mechanics (some prefer Spell Fighter VR - which is great - but I think the dodge/block/parry mechanics are better here).\n- Engaging atmosphere despite the sourced assets (ie: the character models were bought from a store).\n- Solid music.\n- Intuitive puzzles.\n- Leaves you aching for more content.\n\nCONS:\n- An argument can be made that it is a short experience. However, none of us early adopters should go into *any* game thinking we're going to experience the next Skyrim/Dishonored/etc...\n- While I think the utility belt inventory system is very interesting, I have to hyperextend my head downwards to see it. It also moves around erratically when I'm kneeling down.\n- I'd love it if there was more depth to the magic system (currently it's item-based magic limited to one item at this time). Not hoping for a miracle here, but it would've been nice to play as a wizard rather than a sword fighter every time.\n- No Hard Mode. While enemy difficulty does increase slightly, they are far outpaced in damage after gaining the last sword. They also become easier in general by the time you have a second playthrough. Hard Mode needs to happen.\n- Trackpad locomotion for both movement and turning would be superior for those of us with 'vr legs'. I like teleporting sometimes, but in battle I'd rather just reorient myself with the trackpad. It feels like cheating to just teleport away.\n\nAnyway, I hope this inspires other devs to keep the ball rolling and iterate on RPG/Adventure games. And to the dev of this game in particular, please keep up the good work. There's not many who've gambled on anything resembling an RPG at this stage in the VR launch cycle, and you're currently leading the pack by a wide margin.

While some of the mechanics could use a little more refinement, the total experience is wonderful, and really gives you a good look at what large scale games for VR will eventually be like. There are some really nice level design moments, such as the room with the archer you can't reach right away, which feel really new in VR. Some suggestions:\n\n- Magnet on object pickup, especially on gold/coins\n- Limited, but recoverable, ammo for the bow. It's too exploitable right now.\n- All small objects should be interactable. Because so many of them are not, I got confused in the begining and didn't realize I could pick up the torches. Consistency of object interaction seems more important in VR than in regular games.\n- A bit more hand holding in the first rooms.\n- Current mechanics for grab/let go are a little confusing as they are slightly different than many games (most likely because you want the sword/etc to equipt without having to keep the trigger pressed) - but I often ended up dropping items by mistake, and eventually lost my pick axe this way.\n- More hidden goals, secrets, etc for replayability.\n\nOverall though this is one of my favorite games for early VR, and I can't wait for more.","May 29","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The bow right now is sort of overpowered due to infinite arrows, and enemies at a distance will most of the time just stand there while you shoot at them over and over until they die - even if there is a fairly obvious path to you, and even if it's a "boss". Perhaps making arrows a limited resource would help. E.g. you could loot some arrows from the arrow-filled skeletons you find, and the bowmen you kill. On the other hand that means there should be some other way to kill bowmen on unreachable ledges (orberhaps you will be forced to just dodge them).","May 16","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is full of the heroic feel of making your way through a dungeon, and solving the riddles feels really nice, they are pretty simple but just neat enough that you feel smart for figuring them out.\n\nThe game is extremely immersive, but I will warn there isn't that much content in terms of playtime to it. For $20 you are pretty much getting 2 hours of playtime total in one run. It is early access but no more chapters are being added free, and it seems like the early access page is perhaps a little vaguely worded to hide this, but it seems future chapters are going to be a separate game and early access is just for future polish.\n\nAll in all it really is a great experience from start to finish, just that period of time between start and finish is very short. It's good, but I would keep in mind the length of time for the 20 US dollar price tag.","May 16","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For a game which is Early Access that's pretty good in my book.\n\nThe combat is really fun.\n- The Bow + Arrow combo is well balanced but could be much better if Van. R. adapts the system from Valve's The Lab instead of the one they are using.\n- Hammer and Sword are cool but they could feel a bit more "round". Maybe add a bit of vibrations when hitting the enemy or something like that.\n- Shield is S-class, arrows pierce through a bit and give a super cool feeling. Not sure if there's vibrations actually. Was too immersed to really check that. It's just god damn statisfying learning the quirks and hits of every big dude and blocking the ♥♥♥♥ out of his strikes.\n- Wand is OGMWTFBBQ.\n\nGeneral movement is pretty well done, although the auto pause is a bit too agressive when pointing your sword through objects but that's not so bad and can be turned off.\n\nSome minor quirks with how far monsters "back off" when playing on a 2.5x2.5m roomscale but that's still not a big deal, short teleport and that is an interesting dynamic this way.\n\n","April 19","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The visuals are gorgeous once you're inside of the game, and the use of roomscale is excellent if you have the room to move from different pieces of cover.  I had so much fun during the archer battles and ranged combat.\n\nThe melee combat is a little less satisfying but still overall a great deal of fun.  Like others have said sometimes the enemies end up getting to close to you and it makes combat slightly awkward, granted once you learn how to teleport around the battlefield like a boss this becomes much less of an issue.  My only gripe with the melee combat.....why isn't there vibration on the wand when your sword makes contact with something?  That seems like it should be natural, and it would go a long ways towards immersion.\n\nThe game is a bit on the short side, but it will make for an excellent demo game, and has proven to me that sword fighting can absolutely work (at least in single player) games with the Vive.  I was always confident that I could parry or block an attack that was coming without worrying about clipping, or feeling like my sword simply floats through the enemies.\n\n8/10 for now.  With more chapters and sword vibrations this could easily become a 9 or even 10/10.\n\n(seriously drinking potions? So badass.)","April 26","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are more enemy types than what is shown in the screenshots & video, and you also have ranged combat options in addition to sword and board. Travel beyond your chaperone area is done via short range "blink" type teleportation that works fine. There are occasional elements that leverage room-scale quite well, at one point I actually got on my hands and knees to get past a certain hazard & grab some treasure. The combat is a bit sloppy, but it's satisfying. At this point the inventory system isn't great, but the dev has posted indication that he has an improvement pending in the next patch.\n\nI recommend putting on some soft, 1 to 5 pound wrist weights to improve the feeling you get when playing.","April 26","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Like add a slider somewhere that lets you determine how fast mobs respawn.  Teleporting around a level looking for stuff will get people motion sick if it's not broken up with some combat here and there.  What would be EVEN BETTER, would be something like a marathon mode where you fight mobs back to back without having to worry about plot.  Maybe have a linear progression so you're not constantly moving up and down platforms.  The platforms make for a better story-mode, but you can get VR sick if you're spending 3+ hours going up and down and up and down and up and down and up and down.","April 27","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is exactly how I want my VR games to be! I was skeptical at first but before long I was completely engrossed in this world.\n-Teleporting works great once you get used to it.

Very cool, immersive and well done. For some reason my entire experience felt slightly tiled by a few degrees. The only gripe I had was the enemy AI being quite poor. You could essentially just crouch very close to any enemy with your shield up then take your sword and get it under their shield, just swinging it around for insta-kill... Kind of a cheap exploit. I think VR AI has to be a lot better than traditional AI, especially for Melee combat.

What can I say? There is not enough to nit pick at to say the game is not worth buying for VR. It is a great VR RPG. It is rather short but what are we to expect for a newly full functioning VR system? Triple AAA? They take long to make and I am sure they are on the  horizon. Plus I am not sure games for VR are going to be better with 50, 100, 200 hours of gameplay unless they are multiplayer. You just can not be in VR for super long distances of time. Yes people I know you technically can but the way I see it most people do VR in spirts unless in MP. If you have VR and like RPGs then support this developer and encourage them to do more VR games especially devs that support room scale and motion controllers which boils down to actual VR Immersion.

Fighting opponents in old-school games could easily get boring, not so when there is a huge skeleton swinging various weaponry at you. Don't think, just buy it :)","June 6","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
