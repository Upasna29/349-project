Yes I did.\n\nLet me explain.\n\nAll games I play I start on the hardest possible settings. I dislike easy mode because bad habits and the real intent of the developers never shines through. (The devs need to make games easy for some people because they're either time-poor or effort-poor and well, their money and wishes are just as important right?)\n\nAnd this does that. In SE, easy mode doesn't teach you anything. It's a "Lego meet Asteroids" style and some even called it for a "Minecraft" clone as a result. Add building block. Add another block, and another ad infinitum until you have spaceship. For me, it got boring quickly. It's called "creative mode"- just... build.\n\nAnd then there's survivor mode - on hard. Whoa!! I struggled for the first few hours. With little in the way of documentation and no real clue as to what to do, it took me over an hour to work out how to build a single block from the remains of a craft crashed into an asteroid.\n\nFirst there's survival. Have I got enough uranium for power? Should I turn on the gravity generator? How can I save energy until I can salvage enough to.... live?\n\nI need to mine. I NEED fuel. I can mine using my included hand drill but it's... messy. Slow. Trite.\n\nSo to mine I need a mining ship. To build a mining ship I need components. To make components I need an assembler. To use the assembler I need steel. I need glass. I need energy.\n\nAnd all I have is a drill. I have a grinder. I have a welder. And in my scenario, I have a ship I can salvage.\n\nPiece by piece with a grinder, all the while careful of my energy limit, my inventory. I need a refinery. The refinery is needed if salvage doesn't give me everything I need so I'll need raw material to convert to ingots, including uranium ore which I convert to processed uranium to fuel the reactor so I can do ALL these things.\n\nDo you see where this is going?\n\nTo build my mining ship I need a mining drill. To build the drill I need motors, steel etc. Some of these can be salvaged. Some have to be made. Every component needs to located, transported, linked and welded. EVERY component. You need a plan. A rough sketch on what you intend to build helps alot. It gives you purpose because time is of the essence. if you're not watching and run out of fuel you're.... dead. No energy means no refining of uranium ore to refuel.\n\nIt's a grind. And a weld. Yep. Grind and weld. Hour after hour floating in your pressure suit. Maybe you can leave the grav gen on and walk around, expending more of that precious reactor fuel. Who knows. The decisions you make determine what you build and how fast it's going to take.\n\nThe flying is... space like. There's 3 dimensions. There's gravity. There's velocity. There's death. There's no attitude indicators, sky markers, "horizon" indicators, compasses or such.\n\nFly too far, lose your bearings and home.... disappears.\n\nThere are no fixed paths or objectives (apart from survive). It's a sandbox. And a multiplayer sandbox at that. Go public, lose it all or go "friends only" and do the hard yards with mates to build the biggest dang skyship ever made. There's missiles, guns, turrets, fire and light. Death. There's explosions, broken platforms, busted ships.\n\nOr there's serenity and wonder as you quietly go about your mining ship construction.\n\nThe game caters for everybody from MP gung-ho blast'em players to SP anal-retentives with spreadsheets, CAD and a master plan.\n\nAt alpha, a lot of the options are not as intuitive as I'd like. The UI is a bit invasive and some work could be done here. The universe is.... grey. I'm sure some awesome nebulae would fit in great here and add appeal to the wonder of space.\n\nThere are glitches,  it's alpha as I write, but I've experienced no crashes. It's going to be good thing this Space Engineers and the devs seem happy to include...whatever people damn well please.\n\n7 hours went by in a single session. I'm only half through building my mining ship. I have no objective but to succeed.\n\nMy epiphany? What is success in SE?\n\nIt's when I finish this ship, I'll mine, refine, transport and assemble another. It'll be bigger. It'll do more. The welding torch will blind my eyes as I drift in and out of the superstructure boundaries, my suit energy draining away.\n\nI'm fascinated.\n\nTHIS can only get better...\n\n9.5/10\ngg","May 4, 2014","true","152.2"," 3,079 of 3,310 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","079","3","3","96"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/auhrii/recommended/244850/","auhrii","Auhrii","http://steamcommunity.com/id/auhrii/","85 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nQuick disclaimer: I may or may not be somewhat biased due to the 812 853! hours that I may or may not have put into this game at the time of writing.\n\nOverall Verdict\nThough I hate myself for saying this, Space Engineers is practically Minecraft if it were set in space and had awesome damage modelling. Damage modelling so good, in fact, that it was the main selling point of the game when it first came out. Here's a quick list of pros and cons for quick reference:\n\nPros\nGreat damage modelling (armour blocks deform as they collide with other objects and/or are shot at by the inevitable gang of players and/or AI pirates who want to pillage your scrap metal)\nSandbox mechanics and (mostly) reasonable balancing\nAlready has Steam Workshop support with an active modding community\nWorlds can be fine-tuned to suit your play style using what I can only describe as a wall of tick-boxes\nIn-game programming (using a sandboxed C# implementation) that allows for automation without severely impacting gameplay balance\nAlready peer-to-peer and dedicated multiplayer support\nFrequent updates (every Thursday!)\nCons\nSUPER IMPORTANT: This game has dropped support for DX9 and Windows XP! If you have a system that only supports either of these, you can still play the last version to support them by choosing the WinXP/DX9 branch in the game properties.\nPretty performance heavy at the moment (though I can run on high settings with a mobile i7 and GTX 860M at around 50fps in most cases)\nMultiplayer is currently plagued with issues; rubber-banding is the most common, and dedicated servers suffer from game breaking bugs\nOverall, I highly recommend this game. That said, I am a recluse who never, ever plays multiplayer on any game under any circumstances unless it's on a private server.\n\nSurvival Mechanics\nFor those who are planning to buy this for the survival mode, I'll be completely honest: Space Engineers does it slightly differently, but it's not revolutionary. You have 3 main worries whilst in space: Energy, Oxygen (assuming you enabled Oxygen in the world settings) and Hydrogen. Energy and Oxygen deplete over time (the former depletes faster as you use tools, and the latter only depletes if you have your helmet closed), and you need to mine Ice to put in an electrolyser to replenish your O2 and H2 supplies. Hydrogen, as you could probably guess, is required for your jetpack to function, and depletes faster if you jetpack whilst in a natural gravity field (artificial fields have no effect).\n\nNow on to the environmental hazards - you can currently enable meteor showers with varying intensities, ranging from "Safe" (no showers, just worry about your ships being disintegrated if you get shot at or use rotors/pistons anywhere within a 1km radius) to "Armageddon" (where huge, flaming chunks of rock hurl themselves at everything you cherish every couple of minutes). Unfortunately, this feature didn't live up to potential and feels half-baked - meteor showers lock on to a random ship each wave, instead of being truly random (this would be excusable in higher settings, as they are unrealistic anyway), and the meteors aren't affected by planet atmospheres. Like everything, though, this is subject to change as the game is still Alpha, yadda, yadda, yadda.\n\nAs for hostile NPCs, I'll start first with cargo ships (which are currently disabled due to issues with planets - Keen says they'll bring them back Soon™): they currently choose a random position at least 10km from all players to spawn in, choose a heading that won't bring them within 5km of any player (from experience) and spawn in moving in that direction at a set speed. All of them (with the exception of the first pirate craft, the Argentavis) have no AI and will only stop if the player either attaches a ship and brakes or accesses the ship's control panel and enables the inertial dampeners. However, it should be noted that many of these ships (if not all of them) have automated turrets which *do* have AI and *will* fire on you if you approach within 800m, assuming you have weapons enabled in the world (these tick-boxes getting old yet?), and some vessels even contain hidden surprises that... well... "surprise" you if you happen to enable their dampeners.\nThen there are the actual NPC NPCs (I suck at explaining, shush), assuming you enabled them in world settings: "Sabiroids", which appear on alien-type planets, and "Cyberhounds", which appear on Earth-like worlds. I've already rambled on long enough, so I'll condense this. The Sabiroids are basically giant metal-eating space spiders that will tear your ships asunder should you happen to leave them unguarded on the ground, but will drop the components they eat should you kill them. Cyberhounds, as the name would suggest, are robotic hounds that charge at the nearest player without any kind of pathfinding (from my 5-minute first experience with them before I found them boring and disabled them), very slowly destroying blocks that happen to (very regularly) get in their way.\n\nEnd Token\nThanks for reading this very, very long-winded and probably rambling review, and I hope it proves useful - if not, feel free to suggest what I should add/change/remove in the comments, and I'll see to it at the next opportunity. Thanks again!","March 26","true","905.4"," 717 of 761 people (94%) found this review helpful 54 people found this review funny","94","717","761","54","18"

My partner in crime placed the blocks. I welded them in place and splashed some paint on it all once the basic shape of it was finished. It was not large, but it was clean, functional, and designed with sophistication.  It was ours, and we had built it out from the tiny little square of space we had started with, turned it into our own little command post lodged in the side of an otherwise unnoteworthy asteroid.\n\nThe ships came first, though. Without the ships, there were no resources to build with. First was the mining ship. We equipped it with four sets of drills and my partner took it out on missions to gather more resources. He was gone, and so I built our second ship: a fast little cruiser made only to get from one place to the next or to scout out potential mining sites. We called it the Toad. And so we settled into a routine: I would take the Toad out and find a nice planet ready for excavation and he would go plow into it with the mining ship. We unloaded the materials. We assembled them into parts. We put those parts into the blocks he had put down. We toiled. We slaved. We built and built and built.\n\nAnd when it all was done? When everything was in place? What did we do then? Did we recline in our player base? Did we look out over the catwalk railing and say, "Look what we have built from nothing. Admire our structure." Did we bask in the glory of a hard fifteen hours of work?\n\nNo. We planned. We created. We started on the true project, the beginning of our empire: the Mothership.\n\nIt was designed to be bigger than our entire station: two refineries of its own, three storage containers, twelve gigantic thrusters, enough room in the hangars to store both of our ships (and possibly more), several medical bays to respawn in—and one ridiculously enormous ship. We placed the first block above our station. And then another and another, until the massive frame of it started to block out the light. It was a monolith to our own accomplishments, a totem of sheer ingenious design and willpower. Not a block was out of place, not a single reactor was missing.\n\nAnd then we ran out of resources. The frame was all done, but the blocks couldn't be finished without more steel plates. We need iron—a lot of iron. So away my partner went! He climbed into the mining ship, steered it towards our latest excavation site and gunned the engines. He hit max speed. He piloted the ship around the end of the ghost-like frame of the Mothership. And then it happened—the unthinkable: he ran out of fuel.\n\nPop Quiz: An object in motion . . .\n\nStays in motion. And he clipped it. He clipped the mother ship. Grazed right off of it and, with no way to stop the mining ship from moving forward, had to bail out of the ship before it carried him away to oblivion. There was a panicked rush to mount a rescue of our mining ship by using the Toad to chase after it so we could supply the mining ship with the fuel its reactor needed to activate the reverse thrusters and stop the ship.\n\nWe gathered the fuel. We undocked the ship. We prepared to launch. Then, with the slow, heart-pounding realization of a horror film, a shadow passed over the Toad.  We looked up at the Mothership, our entire view eclipsed by its awesome mass. We dropped our tools and stared in gut-twisting horror.\n\nThe whole thing.\n\nTilting.\n\nSpinning.\n\nMoving.\n\nCrashing.\n\nThis is what happens when you let normal people pretend like they're Space Engineers.","January 12, 2015","true","21.8"," 458 of 475 people (96%) found this review helpful 442 people found this review funny","96","458","475","442","10"

I usually take a fat pinch of salt when I see new 'build your own' style game comes come onto Steam too. Not in this case. Space Engineers has quickly earned a spot in my all time favorite PC games for its dynamic and engaging construction system and it's got one of the coolest looking destruction systems I've ever seen in a game like this. The devs have been keeping up with weekly updates since its launch and they're very involved with the community. As a matter of fact, player made content will be appearing as randomly spawned ships in the upcoming exploration patch.\n\nThe construction system is very simple, even familiar for most people I'm sure. It's like Minecraft, in that you're building pretty much everything out of blocks, but that's where the similarities end. Ships are made by sticking a power plant, cockpit, a couple gyroscopes and thrusters (In every direction by the way! Space has no gravity or atmosphere so your ship needs forward thrusters to slow down, etc), maybe a few weapon systems. Then you have to hook up conveyor pipes to most of those things to power them with resources and components you get from mining asteroids. Ships can be as big or as small as you like, the only real limit is how much your PC can handle. Everything from little scout fighters, mining ships, frigates, fighter carriers and even humongous titan-sized battleships can be built. Yes, you could even build your own Death Star, but you might have to wait a little while for a working Superlaser. Or you could just mod your own Superlaser into the game, because Space Engineers has a modding API and a fully fledged Steam Workshop page that's already crammed with all sorts of player created content.\nThere's also an integrated blueprints system (And a corresponding hologram projector for constructing saved blueprints from scratch) so you can save ships and carry them over to other servers/maps, or if the first ship you had gets destroyed and you want a replacement, you can just ctrl-v it into the game after selecting it from the blueprints menu. Very very handy.\n\nShips and stations crumple, tear and otherwise deform when they take damage, whether you're hosing them down with lead, setting off explosions or just smashing into eachother for fun. You can see the damage your ship takes over time as holes, scratches, dents and warping are modelled into most blocks. Even portions of your ship can be sheared off and cause extra damage as they free float in space, getting knocked around and causing even more havoc as they get caught on your ship and tear it apart from the inside if you're not careful. The same rules apply to your enemy too though. It's very exciting and sometimes anxiety-inducing, the way combat works.\n\nThere are two gameplay modes currently, survival and creative. Survival mode lets you build everything from scratch and assemble it together using the various ingame tools you're provided with. Everything needs to be constructed piece by piece and you're limited by how many resources you have and what kind of tools you have available. You can mount bigger and better drills, welders and grinders onto your ships after you acquire enough supplies.\nCreative mode is exactly what it sounds like; you have free reign to do whatever you like in the galaxy and everything is constructed instantly the second you place it down.\n\nA pretty solid multiplayer mode with player-created factions and servers was patched in a while ago. It even supports mods. I haven't spent a lot of time online aside from on my own private server I play with one or two friends on but there's practically no change between offline and online gameplay aside from some occasional connectivity and performance issues.\nThe multiplayer still needs quite a bit of polishing, as does the overall performance of the game, but so far it's come together very very nicely and I expect I'll put another fifty hours or so into the game before it's released.\n\nIf you're into Star Wars, Battlestar Galactica, Warhammer 40k or any other scifi genre, buy this game. You'll thank me later.","December 16, 2014","true","208.3"," 233 of 247 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","233","247","0","0"

Many of these 350 hours were enjoyable, and if you'd asked me 6 months ago whether to buy this game, I 100% would have told you to go for it.\n\nThe conceptual design of the game is amazing.  The way the ships lock together through all the different engineering features is just plain awesome.  The dynamic nature and wide range of build options will unleash your creative child, and you'll find yourself spending many hours nutting out tricky designs to see what works best.\n\nThe community is even better.  The people I've met playing SE have usually been mature and fun to play with.  There's always a few exceptions .. but hey, we're gamers, right?  The mod community is extremely active and you can find a mod for just about anything.\n\nSo why won't I recommend this game?  Well ...\n\nIt's buggy.\n\nAnd by buggy I don't just mean buggy in an annoying way.  I mean buggy in a way that will progressively drive you crazy.\n\nWith early access, this is normally forgivable.  Early access itself comes with an implicit promise that the developer will eventually fix most (if not all) of the bugs and eventually release the game.  So paying cash for something in early access usually involves developing a thick skin for the bugs.  I knew this going in, and it didn't stop me.\n\nBut after 2 years in early access, a disappointing pattern has been emerging with this game.  I don't think that the person responsible for prioritising the work for SE actually plays the game.  If they did, they would likely be running things very differently.\n\nAt the moment SE is running a weekly release cycle.  Mid to late in the week, the developers push out an update containing features and often a few fixes.  The root problem seems to be that each update brings too many features, and not enough fixes.\n\nThe result is that over time, what initially started as a fairly simple physics sandbox game has evolved into a massively ambitious project full of unfinished features.  Almost every time a feature is released, it gets 90% done, then left on a shelf.  Sometimes the 10% isn't that important, and the feature is worthwhile.  More often the 10% is something rather critical (like ability to work in multiplayer) and the feature simply becomes a point of frustration, as you spend hours trying to make it work or basing designs off it, only to have it fail you in the worst possible ways.\n\nI have very limited experience in games development, but 15 years in the software industry have taught me that letting the bugs stack up is a really bad way to develop a product.  The longer a bug remains in software, the harder it is to fix.  The more you stack on an unstable codebase, the buggier it gets.  The SE forums are completely littered with bug reports, many of them very serious.  The developers know about the bugs, but instead of fixing them, they just add more features.\n\nI don't think this is going to end well for SE.  At the time of writing this review, I can no longer stand to play the game through the seemingly endless number of bugs that plague it.  It's starting to look like one of two things will happen:\n\n1. SE will stay in early access forever.  It will continue to sell copies.  The developers will keep adding features.  The bugs will keep stacking up, until some critical level is reached where people get so frustrated that the review standings and sales plummet.  Development then scales back (or stops) and the game is left in early access.\n\n2. SE will leave early access in a buggy state, not with the level of stability expected in a finished product.  This will in turn lead to lots of disappointed people, bad ratings, and probably a collapse in sales and support.\n\nI want Keen Software to prove me wrong in this.  I would LOVE for them to prove me wrong, and get SE out of early access into a stable state where it can be as awesome as it deserves to me.  But with every feature release, I lose a little more faith.  This seems to be a constant problem with the approach of funding games using early access - there is no commercial incentive to ever actually leave early access.\n\nSo it looks like SE for me will remain a broken dream.  To anyone that is considering buying this game, I recommend first taking a look at Empyrion - its build system isn't yet as sophisticated but even in its very early days I found it much more stable than SE.\n\nBut if you can't resist and you really want to buy the game, be careful with the following features.  They will give you little but frustration:\n\n- Pistons and Rotors (these mess up the centre of gravity in ships, and intermittently cause massive unexplained velocity/damage - especially in multiplayer)\n- Wheels (no effective brakes + other physics bugs)\n- Small ship conveyors (these don't bridge effectively with normal conveyors. The blocks that connect them are intemittently unreliable)\n- Landing gear (hitching and physics issues, especially in multiplayer), connectors are better\n- Batteries on complex power grids (when combined with reactors and solar panels, these need to be micro-managed.  It's improved recently, but will still drive you crazy)\n- Projectors (these will destabilise servers in multiplayer, giving big crash issues.  Big loss as there's no way to move ships to survival mode without them)\n- Large ships and complex worlds (the game server itself seems to run all ticks on a single thread, so any more than 1 CPU core is wasted.  This means there's no way it can scale as ships get bigger and worlds get more complex.  Everything just slows down)\n- Ships parked on unlevel planet surfaces in multiplayer (jerks around like crazy, can be very disappointing as it often destroys the ship)\n\n---------- 15th January 2016\n\nThere's been some interesting developments lately for the SE project.  Marek Rosa (the controller/owner of Keen Software and first dev on the SE project) has taken a renewed interest in the game and earlier this week, he did a live stream over twitch where he played it online.  The stream was very revealing as it showed how little exposure Marek has had to the current state of the game.  Over most of the stream, he was chatting with the other devs and pointing out issues with the game that he wanted to see fixed.  More information on this here - https://www.reddit.com/r/spaceengineers/comments/40jbfk/marek_rosa_says_this_is_♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t_to_space/\n\nIt's become pretty clear that many of the development problems in SE have originated from a gap in leadership.  Marek seems to have realised this and is taking serious steps to exert more control over the project.  Today he posted a lengthly article consisting of a very long list of issues with the game he wants to see addressed, with a strongly worded commitment to fix bugs and get the product out of an early access state - http://blog.marekrosa.org/2016/01/the-ksh-roadmap-for-2016-space_14.html\n\nI find this very encouraging.  Perhaps there is hope for SE yet.  Considering the current broken state of the game, I'm not yet ready to recommend it to others, but I do think this is one to watch.  If Keen can make significant progress towards fixing SE in 2016, it may just become a game worth buying.","December 8, 2015","false","360.9"," 1,101 of 1,337 people (82%) found this review helpful 53 people found this review funny","82","101","1","53","119"

This game is fantastic, and you'll hate every hour you spend on it.\n\n--- To Begin ---\n\nI have been a part of the Space Engineers community for quite a very long time. Although at first, the game was still being developed (as in... Before weapons, detonations, and the etc existed at all). By then, I enjoyed the game for a while however was never extremely hardcore into it. This all ended up changing around the past month and so however. With the introuction of new community groups, factions, and of course mods, (also of course the content being added every week) the game has never had a segment of any real 'boredom'.\n\n--- Graphics ---\n\nThe graphics on this game are done pretty well for many of the Sandbox Sims I have seen out and around. It is noted though, that to run this game on higher graphics settings you -will- require an at least decent PC to run this game sufficiently. There are of course a few glitches with the Early Access still above, such as a few lighting and shading bugs here and there, and the occasional block bug ot glitch. Overall though, the graphics and physics are all well and nice to look at (for the hours you will spend in the realms of space), of course.\n\n--- Gameplay ---\n\nThe gameplay is something that will vary depending on you yourself. If you enjoy building new (NOT FEATURED!)land, orbital, or space creations; enjoy exploring the infinite fields of asteroids, (NOW FEATURED!)planets, moons, and simply space; and would want to join the already growing and very friendly, creative and supportive community, then this is the game for you! The gameplay is fairly simple to a certain degree, the building being commonly referred to as 'minecraft in space'. This, however, changes drasticly past the simple placement of blocks, such as the production chains from mineral ore, to basic materials that can be processed into components that then are used to build and create each block in the game. This is a game where commonly you would want to play with a friend or even more (the more the better!).\n\n--- Community ---\n\nThe Space Engineers Community is one of (if not the) most active and creative communities I have grown to be a part of on Steam. The Workshop houses hundreds of thousands of player-made creations ranging from spaceships of combat, commerce, and civilian use, as well as stations of all types, ground vehicles and orbital ships, as well as now including land bases. There are also an array of hundreds of player factions, from pirates and mercccenaries of war, to civilian trading corporations and industrial commerce administrations. There is never a shortage of player-created factions, and it is always a great idea to find one that suits your interests best, and join in to meet other and new friends, and to share designs, tips, and your own universe experiences.\n\n--- Concluding ---\n\nOverall, Space Engineers is a wonderful game. Although there are of course bugs, errors, and situations that occur, this is  still in Early Access. The game itself is doing quite well so far, and I, alike many many others, are excited to see what will be released next. The release of planets today is a revolutionary new feature as well (Although it is a bit of a framerate kill on weaker PCs). Multiplayer still does have a bit of connection and server bugs, however it is functional and does work for the majority (though most problems I have experienced were from the server hosts themselves).\n\nAll in all, a great game, and I recommend it for any space, simulator, or sandbox fan.\n\nAlways remember, have fun!

Even though it's early access, this feels like a whole title. Even if the developers were to drop it completely (which they show zero signs of doing), it would still be worth $20. Some quick pro/cons:\nPRO:\n+Massive creative potential.\n+Good modding community.\n+Strong multiplayer.\n+Active and player-friendly developers.\n\nCON:\n-Difficult UI. I had to look up tutorials on YouTube to get a decent idea of how to do things (Thanks, Gas Bandit!).\n***This has since been fixed with a tutorial! Told you the developers were awesome.\n-Little guidance, expects you to tough out the rookie mistakes and learn\n***Again, see above edit. Developers are awesome.\n-Brutal PvP online. Do NOT go online without playing single player first and getting the hang of things.\n\nI love this game. It's tough on your computer, though. It runs on my laptop, but barely. Definitely stick with smaller ships and maps unless you have a monster gaming PC. With a little help regarding the UI, some optimization to improve performance, and just more of what the devs have been doing, by the time this hits 1.0 it will be one of the best games of it's kind.\n\nTL;DR- This game is good, doesn't feel like early access. Make sure to check the min/rec'd specs, as it's pretty demanding of your PC. Watch tutorials online (check out Gas Bandit on YouTube) to not be a noob floundering and dying for 3 hours straight.\n\nEDIT: My laptop has 4 GB of RAM, i3 M370 2.4 GHz (I think. Computer stuff isn't my thing). I stay on small world settings, very few asteroids, basically bottom end graphics. If you can run Skyrim, Civ 5, Kerbal Space Program, then you can run this.

A botched docking by my somewhat less-skilled colleague melted half the platforms off, and now we’re both trying to catch the bits that are left floating through space. A few minutes of work later we complete the job, just as a business shipment appears at the edge of our sector. A silent nod later, he’s in an interceptor and I’m in a cargo whale both chasing down the hapless vessel. I attach to the front end and slow it to a stop with my powerful thrusters, before both of us rush through and check for traps. I cut through a block, without realising that it was where the entire front end was attached. My colleague grumbles and curses as the dissected ship gently drifts apart.

Before symmetry mode was a thing, before survival mode, before thruster damage or multiplayer or many common mechanics were implemented.\n\nI've got nearly 430 hours into it now, and I'll definitely rack up a lot more. Here's why.\n\n-Infinite possibilities.\nDo you want to build a racetrack in space and dash around in gravity-tethered go-carts? You can do that. Demolition derby? Sure, that's feasible. Starfighter dogfights? Yup, you bet'cha. Capital ship slugfests? Seen 'em, they're pretty. Just build without restrictions, build whatever you can imagine? Ayup. Survival mode? Oh, oh hell yeah.\n\n-Multiplayer\nSometimes sketchy, but generally reliable as of the last few patches, Space Engineers multiplayer is genuinely fun. Not in the shoot 'em up bang bang pew pew sort of way, more of the mutual cooperation so you don't all suffocate and die horribly in space sort of way. It's a huge change of pace, and the recent updates have made it feasible to do more than merely survive. You can explore, you can wander the 'verse and see all the beauty and horror it has to offer.\n\n-Physics\nDem physics doe. Needs a little fine-tuning in places but it works out brilliantly otherwise, and allow for artificial gravity and zero-gravity to happily coexist. Crashes are spectacular, damage from kinetic torpedoes is impressive, and for the non-combat oriented, it's just plain fun to fiddle with the physics in this game. From making orbiting satellites to devising new and innovative ways to send things flying at ludicrous speeds.\n\n-Update speed\nKSH is awesome. They push out updates every Thursday, barring major holidays or a sudden and inexplicable bear assault on their offices. They work hard to keep the game up to snuff and it shows with just how far its come in relatively little time.\n\n-Steam Workshop Integration\nSeriously awesome. Want a mod? Grab it. Want to play with someone's ship? Snag the blueprint. Want a new skybox? Done. New world? Easy peasy. Workshop is an amazing tool and it allows you to very easily - and very rapidly - add new spins on the base game.\n\n-KSH is awesome\nSo good they deserve their own bullet point. These guys work hard, are creative, are pretty honest about where they're at and what's going on, and push out updates and fixes like clockwork. They're enthusiastic about their product, they're in touch with their playerbase, they listen to their playerbase, and they're willing to learn from their mistakes so that they can overcome future hurdles. They're working hard and the game is only getting better with each passing week.\n\nIf you're on the fence about this game, don't be. It's a good, solid title. It has its bugs, yes, it has its glitches and its problems, but they've spent several weeks weeding out the bulk of the problems and it plays pretty smoothly now. There's modding support, multiplayer, survival mode, creative mode, and they're rolling out exploration-oriented content - plus patches every Thursday. Not much beats that.\n\nIf you like  building games, buy it. If you like mining games, buy it. If you like exploring, buy it. Some folks say it's minecraft in space, and in a sense it is. It's virtual legos for sci-fi gamers and hopeful shipbuilders, and it's just flat-out fantastic for it. Strongly, strongly recommended.","December 29, 2014","true","713.6"," 95 of 101 people (94%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","94","95","101","6","1"

To some degree, you need to accept to adapt. If that doesn't work for you, then don't buy this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/midnightwolfie/recommended/244850/","midnightwolfie","MidnightWolfie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/midnightwolfie/","597 products in account","This Review is VERY outdated! This is the review of the game back in December of 2013!\nThank you all for reading!\n\n\nA bit about the game and developers.\nSpace Engineers is a sandbox game about engineering, construction and maintenance of space works. Imagine it as Minecraft in space, where you can fly what ever you build by your own hands. This game is still in a very early Alpha stage, therefore you must know that a lot of things might, and most likely will change. Space Engineers is being developed by Keen Software House, which are the same guys behind Vrage and Miner Wars.\n\nAbout Gameplay.\nAs said above, Space Engineers is something like Minecraft. Currently the game futures only Creative game mode, in which the player has unlimited resources. Player can just open his inventory, put the items into the toolbar and use how he / she wishes to use it. But there is a small twist. This game is not a voxel based game, therefore building something is much harder than most of the other games. You have to turn the object how you see fit. And putting other objects might be a bit hard, since the objects maybe won't be in a good angle.\n\nThere are many various items that you can use to build your small ship, big ship or a station. As it is probably obvious, You can fly small and big ship, but you can't fly a station. And you really wanted to make a huge carrier, didn't you? Well no problem! Just make a massive big ship. Make it so big that it can actually keep other big ships inside of it! Nothing and no one can stop you from doing that! Will it be slow? Of course it will, but you still did it! You can really build what ever type of a space ship or a space station that you wanted to. The game also has a lot of very nice parts that look nice inside of the stations, such as doors or inner walls, etc.\n\nEverything in this game is destructible. And by that, i mean everything that you have built, or your friend. Even if it's an accident, you can't stop it. If your ship is about to crash into a station, you can do your best to evade it but you will most likely fail, and destroy half of the station and the ship. And the amazing thing is that the developers actually put the effort into that! The destructed objects look amazing!\n\nI have to say, this game will have multiplayer in the future. The developers have already confirmed that a long time ago. And I can tell you, the multiplayer of this game is going to be amazing! Imagine four or five player building massive ships and stations. Gosh, I can't wait to do that! Even though the game is in very early alpha, and it really doesn't offer too much to do for now, exploring the current content of the game already showed me that this game has a lot of potential, and that it might actually have a very bright future!\n\nGraphic and Audio\nGraphically speaking the game looks very good, but it's nothing too special. The visual effects of explosions are very good, and destroyed items look amazing. The game's building "blocks" don't look the same. In fact, they are built in a way that they keep "continuing" each other all the time, therefore each part of your ship looks somewhat different. The game also futures coloring, therefore you can have a rainbow ship! Well, you can't really make that but you can try. Music on the other hand isn't anything too special. It's very fun at the beginning, but it gets rather repeatable after a while.\n\nPros, cons and final grade.\nPros:\n- Space sandbox building game.\n- Multiplayer in the future.\n- A lot of different "blocks" with which you can make many, many different ships.\n- Ability to mine through the asteroids and get minerals. We will see what will we be able to use them for in the near future.\n\nCons:\n- Jet pack is very hard to use.\n- Flying anything is very hard, and there is almost no way to stop your ship mid-air. It will keep on flying away.\n\nFinal Grade: 7.5/10\n\nExtra Info: As mentioned earlier, this game looks very promising. I can guarantee that as soon as this game releases multiplayer, it will be much better and much more fun. We just have to wait and see what will the developers do!\n\nAnd also, I wish everyone Happy holidays! Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to everyone!","December 21, 2013","true","18.6"," 227 of 288 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","227","288","0","13"

The game features endless maps which can be customised in many different ways in two different scenarios, creative and survival. Creative mode gives you unlimited numbers of blocks, infinite health and removes some gameplay aspects whereas in survival you have to mine to create your own materials, you can easily die and you have limited inventory space.\n\nWhile this game is great to play with friends it can be a bit boring to play by yourself unless you're very creative so bear that in mind when you purchase it. Also, please note I am capable of commenting on the realism of the game's physics as I study physics and mechanics.\n\n+The physics in motion are good and seem realistic to me\n+Graphics are okay, they aren't the best but they aren't the worst either\n+You have lots of info displayed about your character and your ship (if you are in one) such as mass, speed and fuel left\n+It's a lot of fun to fly around in smaller ships (better handling) and it's also fun when flying in larger ship to crash them in to each other\n+The building system is pretty simple and easy to use once you get the hang of it\n+The multiplayer is good and playing with friends is a blast, until that one friend we all have decides to crash his ship into yours after an hour of building it\n+Lots of hotkeys/controls including one which toggles the HUD, great for taking screenshots\n+Workshop intergration is good and there are a lot of very good mods available\n\n-Momentum doesn't seem right at all, when two objects collide (no matter what the size) a few blocks will break off and some will be crushed/deformed but that's it, the object that crashes into the stationary object will sometimes rebound off of it or they will both remain stationary. From what I know presuming the velocities of the two objects do not cancel (which they cannot in this situation) either one object or both of them should carry on moving, the sum of the two secondary velocities should be the same as there is no friction to take into consideration and the secondary velocities should be in the same ratios as their mass is. (I hope all of this makes sense).\n-With all the controls (I think most keys are used) it is very difficult to get in to and learn and it's also hard to understand some of the different mechanics such as mining\n-The default skybox isn't particularly high quality\n-You can't pause even when playing offline\n-Character animations aren't great and don't look realistic in my opinion\n-The price seems a bit too high for what you get\n\nWorth a mention:\n-The game has long loading times due to the size of the maps and how much stuff is in them\n-If you have a low end PC or Laptop it's unlikely you'll be able to run it, the game slows down a lot when a lot is going on\n\nVerdict:\n7\n\nThis is a good physics based builder despite it's issues that is best enjoyed with a few friends, I'd suggest waiting for this to get a sale before buying.\n\nEl K.","February 17, 2015","true","5.6"," 190 of 240 people (79%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","79","190","240","27","13"

While the Early Access has a lot of bugs, mostly affecting multiplayer, it is still a blast to play building and flying whatever type of ship you want. It has more than just simple building blocks (the default armor blocks) including things like reactors, solar panels, gatling guns, turrets, pistons, rotors, cargo containers, and more - all of which work and have their own functions. Carefully-designed slope blocks allow you to build ships and stations that only look somewhat "blocky", compared to the cubes-only approach of other building games.\n\nSpace Engineers supports mods like nearly no other game does, with the ability to add mods to a server, and have the clients automatically download the same mods from the Steam workshop. Because of this approach, everybody in a multiplayer game runs the same mods, all without an external modding program! So you see Earth in your skybox? So do the other players. Got custom weapons for your ship? So does everybody else. I expect this server-based mod approach to become more common to where it becomes the standard.\n\nFor Early Access, Keen has done an excellent job with updates and hotfixes that come out weekly (on Thursdays), meaning you can log in once a week and see something fresh, as well as see that progress is being made constantly. This shows me they are serious about the game and they aren't going to just shelf this game before release or before it's ready.\n\nWith the update for players to manually control ship turrets, as well as the player-faction features, this game is becoming more and more co-op supportive, where you can control a large ship with multiple players in different roles. Then you could use that ship against other players' crews in PvP, or fight AI once that is implemented (or when mods add AI ships to fight).\n\nSome of the more interesting things you can currently build include: gravity drives, remote-controlled torpedoes, orbital drones, retractable weapons, rotating antenna arrays, giant miners for strip-mining asteroids, detachable countermeasures (decoys), automatically-opening doors (sensors), and escape pods.\n\nOnce they fix the Early Access bugs and add enough features to release out of Early Access, I have a feeling this will be in many top 10 lists of best space games for a long time, if it isn't already.","October 14, 2014","true","207.1"," 86 of 93 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","86","93","0","2"

Looks at hours played... 1,570.2 Hours on record... Yeah, it's okay I guess.\n\nIn all honesty, there are few games that have kept my attention, despite having moments that make me want to flip my desk as well. I'm referring to weekly patches that add new parts, fix bugs, and also break things. It is not uncommon to have a week or so every now and then where I simply cannot play the game at all due to a crash, but usually a week later that crash is fixed and I can play as normal again.\n\nI have played this game for quite some time, so I have seen it progress a lot from the days when it first came out. This is also one of the few games where I both love and loathe the community. While normally not a part of my reviews, with such passionate fans of the game, the community is partially responsible for the direction the game has gone and that means the devs do listen. On the same token, sometimes you wish the devs would stop listening to the community and polish what they have already implemented. Yes, it is Early Access, but at some point you cannot use that as crutch considering it has been 2 years.\n\nOverall, I do recommend this game. While I do have to set it down on occassion, sometimes for a week or more at a time, it is one of those games that every Thursday I watch the patch video, read the notes, and sink a few hours in.","December 12, 2015","true","660.4"," 166 of 207 people (80%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","80","166","207","24","5"

I'm on a tiny, abandoned and crude space station on the side of an asteroid. I have only couple hand tools, no ship, no material for building. Space is vast, I gotta find uranium, fast. This is very scary flying so far off the base with only my jetpack. ..Oh noo some time down the line I lost the signal for the base! I guess meteor storms destroyed it's beacon.. I have no idea where the base is anymore. Forever, lost in space... ✞\n\nDay 2. I woke up in a clumsy landing pod, descending towards some unknown planet. I'm panicking and trying to figure out the controls, finally, I'm almost on the ground,steady now. Wait, what did this button do.. Oh no! Managed to flip the pod right in the last meters, it exploded.. ✞\n\nDay 3. I managed to land my pod, yeah! I don't need my helmet, I can breathe. First steps outside. Hey Idid't know this planet had life, look at those beautiful dogs, what a big pack! Wait, what the, oh for the love of AAAAHHHHHH.. ✞\n\nDay 4. Back to my asteroid station, life on a planet is too hard. Getting my first scouting ship done, with a tiny drill. I coudn't get my reactors working though. Finally, I figured out the uranium couldn't possibly move through the conveyor system to the reactor without any power. Duh! I ripped the side open and added some uranium directly to the reactor. While doing that I noticed that peeping sound I kept hearing, it was becoming more frequent, I don't think it's part of this song coming from the radio afterall. What is it.. AHHH I HAVE NO OXYGE... ✞\n\nDay 5. Note to self, tossing a piece of rock out of the cockpit while flying full speed will effectively break your ship in half and fling you out. I disorientedly watched my ship parts disappear in mere seconds to the vastness of the space.. Not this again. I figured out how to use the GPS system though and found back to my base, as it was conveniently set to be the zero point.\n\nDay 6. I mustered up enough courage to face those vile dogs and decided to try landing one more time. Once on the ground I immediately installed a turret on my landing pod. Ha Ha! Die you %#&* §¤#! Yeah! They aren't so tough after all. Now off to build a base, quickly! Ohhh hey what on earth happened to my jetpacks now, what do you mean NO FUEL?! I'm middle of flying full speeAAHHH... ✞\n\nDay 7. My planet base is coming off nicely, finding ore though is painful. I have no uranium and I don't have lot of energy left. I gotta move my solar panels higher, but I gotta save my last bits of jetpack fuel for dog emergencies. After a lot of work I built two pylons surrounded by scaffolding, and installed a rotor on top of them with solar panels. I have no idea how to program them to follow sun, though.. eventually, I figured out the day length and just gave the rotor a rotating speed divided by day length. Wow, it works!\n\nDay 8. I used last of my spare energy to power up a small car I built. I turned off everything on my base to keep power usage to minimum. The improved solar panels are still barely charging my batteries. I'm only keeping turrets online to protect the base. Ok off to find uranium! Wow this car speeds up really fast. Oops better avoid that tree, hey what the..! Great, now my car is flipped over in middle of nowhere, I gotta figure out how to turn it around, maybe if I built a piston on the side.. OH MY GOD WHERE DID ALL OF THESE DOGS COMEAHHHH.... ✞\n\nDay 9. I spent a lot of time today fiddling around with my tire controls, the car is now more stable. Gotta still drive it carefully though so it wont flip over, but it's good enough. Ha Ha hey ramming those pesky dogs with it deals with them in no time! Take that! I couldn't get a turret to work on my car, but this is maybe even more satisfactory.\n\nDay 10. I found uranium!! It was very deep in the ground, but I managed to dig a steep slope to it and get back up. Digging in the cramp tunnel is scary and disorienting, I often panick when I can't see the exit anymore and loose my sense of direction. Fair enough the dogs didn't figure out how to follow me down there, I guess they aren't as smart as I thought. Finally I got my refiner and assembler working steady with this uranium. And most importantly, fueling my jetpack is not a problem anymore. One spare tank of hydrogen lasts quite a bit, even in this environment. (I carry 5, just to be sure)\n\nDay 11. I started building a massive drilling ship after watching a distant proadcast from another planet. This guy was telling how he made one, it was very inspiring. He said the scraps of the old landing pod that I already disassembled would be plenty to get it going. He was right. Though I've used lot of the parts already for other things, his design is too big. I will make my own, a bit smaller. May take longer, but atleast I will learn better how to do it.\n\nDay 12. My green driller was coming off nicely (I named it Monster), but one of those damned dogs managed to appear from nowhere and hide where the turrets couldn't see it. Before I even realized it managed to chew through the pedestal where I was building my Monster! Karma is a b*tch though, the dog died right after the ship fell on it, ha ha.. Monster is now flipped sideways on the ground. Luckily it didn't break however, atta girl.\n\nDay 13. I finished building Monster, been working whole day to figure out how to flip her heavy frame back the right way. Those small atmospheric thrusters are really weak! 6 of them are not enough to lift Monster even a bit from the ground. ..Ohh great, now I managed to just get her flipped all the way upside down, sheesh. This model has hardly any thrusters downward, I will have to figure out a new approach..\n\nDay 14. I added several big thrusters on the back pointing up (or down, from this angle). Now if I just coordinate this right it might work. First, lifting the backside up from the ground, and add force to nose tilting, yeah it's working! Monster is now wabbling on it's front drills. Now, carefully adding power to the front thrusters to lift it juuust enough to keep it turning back on it's belly with those new thrusters.. Steady, come on big girl.. Wohooo I did it!!\n\nDay 15. I disassembled those extra thrusters from Monster fast, almost panicking. While I was trying to flip her back I managed to get quite far from the base. I was very afraid of those dogs appearing again and destroying my Monster. I had to add one more big thruster pointing down to get her howering easier. Fortunately I got her flying and now Monster is docked safely on the base. It was quite stable to control too, I am happy. Now I am ready to take over this planet! And some day.. Maybe reach that beautiful outer space again ♥\n\nMost. Addictive. Fascinating. Inspiring. Early Acces Game.

There's a lot to like, but also a lot of frustration, if you happen to take the game's name at all seriously. As it stands, it's not so much about "engineering" in space as about wartime industry...\n\nAs a sandbox platform, Space Engineers is enormously promising. The construction system is beautifully executed, with a great 'mechanical' feel to it. Harvesting ore, refning and building are great fun. The adjustable pace means you can spend little time grinding, lots of time building. Best of all, the problems of movement in zero-gravity are beautifully solved by an intuitive control system.\n\nUnfortunately, the emphasis in successive updates has gradually shifted almost entirely to PvP - more weapons, more targeting systems, more ways to blow up your friends' bases, and/or defend your own. Obviously, a lot of players are thrilled. But this new direction belies the name "Space Engineers." That name suggests an emphasis on building, and doesn't even hint at destruction or combat.\n\nMeanwhile, the 'adventure' backdrop remains bland and featureless, so there's no incentive to build and explore. Just as you're starting to enjoy the brilliant "space engineering" in this game, you run out of challenges. You really need just one good mining ship and one factory base. All the ore you need can be found just about anywhere. There are no NPCs or mobs. No interesting places to go. No need for shipping, no opportunity for trade, or discovery. No skill tree, or experience to earn. No requirement for food - just metal ore. Not even a need to pressurize your habitats - air isn't a concept, so air-locks just get in the way, and you quickly learn to not bother building them.\n\nTrue, you can go ahead and build fanciful structures in creative mode. But really, they're all going to be either a) space ships or b) space stations. And there's nothing in the environment to create any meaning in any finer distinctions. Larger ships? Why? There's nothing to transport, no place to take it. Scout ships? Why? There's nowhere to go that isn't exactly like where you are already. More elaborate space stations? Why? With no air, you don't really need a closed-in space at all -  a big open platform is far more practical.\n\nI keep hoping that the developers will turn their attention back to sandbox play. Add a few new world types - perhaps with some rare ores that would need searching out. With AI mobs that might randomly challenge your building or defensive ability (without being as wantonly destructive as human players). NPCs that would give you some reason to establish shipping routes, or to build specialized bases and ships. In short, an actual game to make this sandbox come alive.\n\nSo, bottom line, I'm giving Space Engineers a thumbs down at this point. PvP fans can ignore this: go ahead an enjoy blowing up each other's elaborate constructions. It's not my idea of fun, but it seems to amuse quite a few people. I'll keep hoping the developers eventually get back to adding more adventure-type elements, and give me a reason to revise this review.\n\nUPDATE: November 4, 2015\n\nA year has gone by, and Space Engineers is still in Early Access. And I'm still not going to put my thumb up, though it's closer to horizontal than before.\n\nSpace Engineers continues to be a beautifully-designed 'sandbox.' The controls are elegant, the visuals are sharp (especially in DX11 mode), and the construction system is fascinating. The new blocks, the oxygen system, all that stuff is great. But it only makes Space Engineers a great platform for a game, not a game as such.\n\nA 'game' consists of a set of rules and a set of objectives. Space Engineers still has no objectives other than those you set for yourself. Calling Space Engineers a great 'game' is like calling Photoshop a 'work of art,' because it gives you the tools to create an infinite number of works of art.\n\nIt's not just Space Engineers - I have the same complaint about a lot of 'sandbox' products. SimCity could use more-defined goals. But SimCity does create a sense of urgency by forcing players to balance a budget, right from the first moment. Minecraft forces players to find food, to defend against enemies, merely in order to survive. And it offers varied and surprising terrain to explore, both above and below ground. It's that sense of urgency, of discovery, that hooked me on Minecraft, and it's what I still find painfully lacking in Space Engineers.\n\nI'm definitely not saying you can't have a lot of fun with Space Engineers (as long as you don't mind making your own fun). I simply can't recommend Space Engineers as a game, to every unknown person who reads my review. The Steam thumb only has two positions.","October 9, 2014","false","66.4"," 1,165 of 1,643 people (71%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","71","165","1","11","287"

But they aren't right, either.\n\nThe game is in an alpha state, and there WILL be bugs, specially in multiplayer (but that's going to be fixed in about 3 months when new netcode is implemented).\n\nRight now the game is almost feature complete. There is way more things to explore than in other games. You could spend a thousand hours on the game yet you wouldn't explore it fully.\n\nWhat annoys the people and make them post negative reviews are the details. It's true that the game has undergone some reckless patches, without any clear goal (remember they patch the game once a week. That puts big pressure on the devs, needing to release features to keep the community happy), but the new roadmap for 2016 states that things will start to be tidier.\n\nNew models, new textures, new UI.  The game is not going to stay like this forever; it will eventually become and look like a finished game. So although the models aren't that pretty, the features are there, aren't they?\nEven though cargo containers might be ugly modeled, they are functional, and that's what counts.\n\nAbout the "reckless last patches". If you bothered to read, you'd know that the new game netcode is being developed RIGHT NOW, so don't expect big patches unless the netcode is released.\n\nLet me tell you some of the things you have right now at space engineers:\nPistons: Yeah, they are buggy right now IN MULTIPLAYER, but that'll get fixed. In single player they are functional.\n\nRotors: Hanger doors, Robotic arms, hidden turrets, moving platforms...\n\nConveyors: Item sorting, automated power / item transfer between ships...Combine with rotors for epic.\n\nPlanets: Fully moddable planets which add several engineering challenges, such as getting out of the atmosphere of a planet (yes, there is gravity and it's not that easy to get out of the planet, specially in survival), or surviving the long trips between planets.\n\nRemote control and Drones: You can send your ship out of the planet without even being aboard. Obviously, this is not easy to do, and requires engineering (and maybe, programming skills if you want more functionality)\n\nProgrammable Blocks: There is an extensive API out of which you can make automated ship station, item sorters, radars, status reports, cargo managers... Or just display the time in an LCD.\n\nHuge modding community: The developers are also focusing on adding modding support to many areas of the game, and right now there is a bunch of mods that ADD REAL FUNCTIONALITY to the game, plus cosmetic ones that look absolutely amazing.\n\nAwesome ship designs in the Workshop: You can get an idea of what kind of ships you can make taking a look at some designs made by other people. You can recreate ships from films and series, like star wars, or from games like FTL. The game offer great building mechanics that make it suitable for a wide range of styles.\nSo yeah, the game is not BUG FREE, nor FEATURE COMPLETE, but right now it can give you LOTS OF FUN for many hours, and many engineering possibilities with all the mechanisms / machines included currently in the game.\n\nThe only serious con I'd see right now is optimization. Seriously, if you want to play on planets with large ships, be sure to get a high-tier gaming rig. I have a 970 which seems enough for the game, and an i5 (this game is CPU intensive!!)\nThe game will eventually get more and more optimized for less powerful computers whatsoever.\n\nTLDR: Despite all the bugs and placeholder models in the game, it offers many features which are already in the game and WILL give you a lot of fun, specially if you play with friends -expect bugs if you play multiplayer -.\nDon't get scared because of negative reviews. The game right now is just developing new netcode and thus the weekly patches are not AWESOME and they introduce some bugs to the game.\n\n","January 30","true","124.5"," 187 of 244 people (77%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","77","187","244","13","14"

It's a shame that after over 1500 hours in game, I have to shelf my favorite game due to bugs. The devs seem totally clueless as to how to fix the game too as every patch makes it worse and less playable. I've built bases, ships of all sizes, mechs, wheeled vehicles, satellite arrays etc, etc but none of it ever gets used cuz there is nothing to really do in the game. The "pirates" are a joke and the cyber hounds was Keen's way of trolling us for all the harsh criticism, I guess. I really miss the days when I could actually do things with my creations. Now mp is broken af and sp is a glitchy mess. Some optimization is noticeable but after almost three years of development the game looks further from completion than ever. Kudos to the dude that made the Trump ship with the caption "make space engineers great again" lmao...\n\nEdit:\n\nI realized my comment above is not a review and more of a rant so here's a review from a veteran space engineer. Warning: I could write a book about this game lol.\n\nAlone on a desolate planet or out in space, the player assumes the role of some kind of demi God or android able to mine and refine raw materials to use in the building of evermore elaborate machines for the purpose of exploring the cosmos and surviving it's dangers.\nFeatures like terrain deformation, a robust building mechanic and a fun physics engine are the highlights of this gem. However, if you're hoping to get out there as a novice and conquer the universe, I'd better warn you: IT'S NOT EASY MAN. The learning curve is steep as can be since the tutorials are garbage and the UI is a nightmare. But after graduating from the school of hardknocks, a masters from YouTube university and some trial and error, things can be built.\nTime to get creative because it's up to you to figure out from where or how the fun is extracted from this title. It MUST be mentioned that the awesome player community by itself almost makes the game worth buying and is a huge source of fun. With that said, the workshop is your friend, just stay away from mp for now. Trust me.\nBuild a miner ship to dig up ore but it's more trouble than its worth since you can just spawn everything you need for free and there is no persistent story world to make you care about it so unless you're really into drilling for the fun of it...  Build a fleet but you're the only one around so...\nBuild a base but you're the only one around so...\nBuild a massive interplanetary communication satellite array to talk to yourself... (although cameras on satellites is a joy like no other)\nBuild wheeled vehicles that would never pass a road test on earth much less on rough alien terrain. To be fair though, I do have some wheeled vehicles that are quite usable and I even tow trailers loaded with stuff with very mixed results. But you're the only one around so...\nSpend hours building a murder ship only to get murdered by your own base defences during its  first test flight.\nBuild a mech that really works till the next update wrecks everything you thought you knew about gravity and turns your mech into another check in the fail column.\nThe most actual fun I've had here is being a pirate. I raid any bases or ships passing by in space and the in game pirate drones act like the police in my case and try to stop me. They in turn get rekt and looted (a gatling gun, a camera, some skill and you're a killing machine). I usually make it home in one piece but since survival mode isn't very good atm, looting is just for fun.\nThe universe is procedurally generated and rendered beautifully but the game is clearly geared toward building since there is no map, radar, story, npcs or end goals although there is stuff to find out there like ships, bases and hostile drones but they are far and few in between. Also, there is a very crude fps element to the game that is better left unspoken. It's an early access title after all.\nMy advice is wait til this game gains some weight and focuses on what's important or play it in creative mode, learn the ropes, build your heart out and blueprint everything. Some must have mods make the game a lot more enjoyable but any update can break their functionality so keep that in mind.\nGet familiar with some of the dev tools provided like space master, voxel hands and spectator mode and the game will open up to you. Otherwise,  save up for some of the more approachable space sim/ builder games out there.\nIf this review seemed too long or complicated then this game is definitely not for you.\nIt's heart breaking to see that the super complex options and block functions get blamed for the poor performance and dev difficulty but this is why Space Engineers is so great. I fear that future devs will seek to "improve" this concept by simplifying and that's sad indeed. In a perfect world, a full space sim would be a blend of SE and other, more story rich titles like Star Citizen. You gotta at least give Keen credit for trying to tackle this giant by developing a whole engine for it. But that's just my opinion. I state it to point out that the lack of "meat and potatoes" could be this title's undoing, not complexity. I can't imagine any casual gamer bearing through the grind for so little reward though.\nI usually play in survival with very few mods, cyber mutts off and space master on for fun and sometimes play creative mode to build freely. The possibilities are endless but the twisted, explosive will of clang always looms just a connector coupling away...\n\n7/10 Although I wouldn't recommend, I would be disappointed by dizzy devs again and again and again","May 16","false","554.8"," 156 of 201 people (78%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","78","156","201","18","18"

With multiplayer, survival mode, and the endless possibilities in your creations, this game has the potential to rival Minecraft as one of the best voxel sandbox building games.\n\nThe screenshots and videos are deceiving and make the game look much more static than it really is. For some reason, the creators focused more on the ability to crash ships than on how much control you have over creating things. You place every single block on your ship. You can build a ship or station in any shape you could possibly imagine. And then fly them around!\n\nAs I write this on April 6th, 2014, there are some important issues with the game that are worth pointing out to those who are considering the purchase.\n\nEdit: There are now dedicated servers. :)\n#1) There are no dedicated servers for multiplayer yet. This means that most MP servers are at least a little laggy, making certain actions in the game very difficult. Being a more tolerant alpha tester, this has not stopped me from having hours of fun in multiplayer working with other space engineers. If smooth co-op is a must for you, I would wait until dedicated servers are out to consider playing.\n\nEdit: There are now conveyors, connector blocks, merge blocks, vacuumming blocks and debris ejectors. :D\n#2) There are some important blocks and features yet to be implemented to make the game more complete. These include conveyors (due in the next 2-3 weeks), pipes, large ship mining drills, working large ship weapons, factions, and automated defenses. These features are all planned, however, and will allow some fantastic gameplay. Fully automated transferring of resources from your mining ships, natural anti-griefing mechanics with defenses that shoot down anyone not in your faction, and more exciting gameplay when capturing randomly spawned NPC ships.\n\nMy favorite things about this game so far are as follows:\n\nA) Jetpack. I can't tell you how many times I have died in Minecraft from building megastructures. That is not an issue in Space Engineers where jetpacks are part of the vanilla game and even have built-in balancing elements (your suit can run out of energy).\n\nB) Your creations move. I have always dreamed of building a car in Minecraft. Yes, there are mods to do anything, but when comparing the vanilla games, Space Engineers really delivers here. You can already built a huge (and I mean HUGE) ship to carry your refineries, assemblers, cargo, and even a fleet of smaller ships in your hand-built hangars.\n\nThis part of the game is just amazing. In my single-player map, I already have a very simple carrier that acts as a fully-equipped, portable space station complete with landing decks for my mining rig and prototype torpedo bomber. I get goose pimples thinking about how the game will play with dedicated servers, player factions, and screaming, "GET TO YOUR SHIPS" to my buddies as we scramble fighters to respond to a player attack.\n\nC) Extremely high player-impact. This is the main thing I enjoy in any game. In Minecraft, you build your own base, terraform the land, and change the world permanently. Others can come and admire your hard work and creativity. In Space Engineers, all this is true, but you could go as far to make a flying city and bring your creations with you anywhere you go. Make your ships as stylish or as ridiculous as you please, and it will change your experience and the experience of others.\n\nD) Promising update schedule. Every Thursday the devs come out with an update, many of which contain new items and loads of fixes. This will make the alpha testing phase that much more exciting for me and indicates that the game will mature nicely.\n\nConclusion: This game has already earned its keep for me. It has cool physics, encourages player creativity, has the potential for some of the best multiplayer action of any sandbox. It may just rival Minecraft in terms of enjoyment and long-lasting, good memories. I give the alpha version 8.7/10 Prawns, with a few more Prawn-Points depending on what the devs accomplish in the near future.

I bought the game right after multiplayer was released in January 2014. This was before survival was introduced. At the time I was very disheartened by a few bad early access titles that were just disappointing.\n\nI looked into the Miner Wars history of Keen Software House, and decided that - even though that was a kind of flop - this game was worth a look into. Maybe a bit of fun with friends. My dream was always to play a game that let you walk around on small planetoids, building your own stuff. After playing games like Cargo Commander I kinda got into the genre. I played a lot of creative at first with my friends and we built huge ships and had fun gunfights.\nAfter a while, when they got bored and survival got introduced, I found a very nice multiplayer RP server with different factions set up and had the time of my life as a Drone Engineer.\n\nMy opinion of the development and further notes to the multiplayer:\nLet me mention a few things about the development of the game (which after all is very important if you read this).\nI don't know if it was from the point on that I bought the game or shortly after that, but the devs (KSH) promised not to promise any features or announce set dates for certain features and introduced weekly updates. Yeah, that's right, one update to the game every single week. That is features, bugfixes and in addition to that hotfixes for big bugs between updates. For me, this shows dedication. This is the game that let me put trust into early access games again. Simply for that fact I adore it. I have never been as hyped about any game as this, and I played a lot of games. The devs react to feedback very fast, and the community really makes a difference.\n\nAlmost all of the features the game has were suggested at some point by us. Planets, scenarios (with set objectives) and multiplayer improvements are already in the works at the time of this post (you can read that up at Marek Rosas Dev Blog[blog.marekrosa.org] ). At this point I have to mention that multiplayer is playable, but you might want to avoid certain things like landing gears, pistons and rotors on ships for now (perfectly fine on stations) as the netcode can't quite handle the synchronization between clients.\n\nMy opinion of the game / features / options:\nThe game has a very thought through, realistic (Newtonic) look at the Space Survival genre, which I would put this into.\nOne of the things that often get overlooked is the amount of options available. Not only does this game have all the necessary sliders (seperate audio volumes, FOV, maximized borderless window option, ... ), you can completely customize almost every feature ingame. A few of those options are mods (which there are thousands of, from blocks over skyboxes, character models, animations, ship blueprints to custom asteroids and scripts) with full workshop support, but also things like the amount of inventory space, production speed, world size (which by the way is currently able to generate worlds that take about 150 realtime years from the center to traverse at standard speed - which if you don't want can be modified, yay - with randomized asteroids and soon planets).\n\nYou can customize view distance, which makes this playable on pretty old machines, even without the beta optimizations that are about to come in still. (Remember, this is in alpha stage)\nAlso tons of other options that en- or disable all kinds of ingame features, should you want / not want them.\n\nCreative mode:\n- If you play creative you can build whatever you want (from cubes of death to star destroyers, your favourite space station or a small fighter) instantly without needing any resources\n- There is a mirror mode that allows you to build quickly and efficiently with symmetry\n- You can copy paste small parts of a creation (onto other parts if you want) which allows you quick builds with forms and structures you like, which helps a lot if you don't think you are creative enough for a whole big ship\n- You are able to spawn in any ingame object, be it resources, weapons or even whole asteroids\n- Talking about asteroids, there is also a voxel tool which lets you deform asteroids to any shape you want (it also lets you replace materials)\n- There is a blueprint system in place, which lets you transfer projections of the ships you built in creative to survival, which makes rebuilding the thing only a matter of resources and time\n\nSurvival mode:\n- This game is a sandbox game, meaning there is no set objective (yet) to "finishing" the game\n- "Exploration" mode offers almost infinite world generation (as mentioned in the features section) with random encounters which range from small ships, to cruisers or large battleships to stations (most of them created by the community)\n- Survival has a lot of facettes to it that require planning (energy generation, oxygen, storage and production facilities) that may initally seem very complex, but the community is always there to help\n- It is possible to use programming blocks to display things via LCD panels, control stations or ship behaviour (really, almost anything you can imagine, if you get into it, someone for example made an autopilot ship and a customizable interface for pilots that let you see every room status and interact with all the different subsystems, just imagine, you get an enemy player alert in your ship, which then leads to depressurization of rooms, so that your enemies can't breathe there or get sucked out into space)\n- You can create gravity weapons (like a huge space shotgun that shoots out projectiles), gravity drives with artificial mass blocks, which, if correctly done, can get even the biggest and bulkiest ships to maximum speed in a matter of a few seconds\n- But even relatively simple things like building your own mining ship or fighter are highly enjoyable and feel rewarding\n\nFinal thoughts / prospects:\nFor me personally it is enough to gather resources, take over enemy weaponized cargo ships that are floating by and creating awesome stations and battleships, aswell as designing them. But man, this game already offers so much more than that. I have never seen a more polished early access game. From RP mining to dogfights in space or replicating your favourite scene from Star Wars, this game has it all!\n\nCommunity links:The reddit with very important tips in the sidebar, like controls\nThe wiki[www.spaceengineerswiki.com]\nThe official forums[forums.keenswh.com]","April 26, 2015","true","580.6"," 111 of 136 people (82%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","82","111","136","8","8"

You fly them around, you crash them, you marvel at the effects. You experiment with crashing different ships into different other ships at different speeds and angles. You accidentally turn on the gatling turret and wonder wtf happened the first time it shoots your cockpit off your ship. Now you need a new ship.\n\nSo you start to learn how to build your own ships (your first ones will be crap - don't lose heart!) After your first real success, you wonder what the limits are (note: you will run out of ram before the game runs out of program).\n\nThen you find the workshop (this is a good time to have a quick browse) and you realise you've been thinking small.

And multiplayer reminds you that building stuff is fun and all, but when some f***er is trying to blow your stuff up, you tend not to build to super-cool stuff until you've built defenses.

If you can build it, you can rebuild it to be better. The only limit to this game is your imagination (and your PC). Right now it is in Alpha and there are a few kinks that the devs are still working on. Some are major, to be fair. However, they are adament about fixing problems and they clearly have a game plan that they are working with. I'll be honest, I've been frustrated at times with the lack of optimisation at the current build, which does affect playability, as it very clearly says that it will in the Early Access banner above. This doesn't mean that it's a game to be passed up though, to say the very least. The game is in development, and the devs show no signs of slowing down or halting progress on their game.\n\nThe developer involvement in the community is top notch, absolutely excellent. As many other reviewers have stated, Keen Software House is definitely setting the bar for how Early Access games on Steam should be done. Just the other day I posted a bug on their forums, and one of the devs by the name of "Phand" got back to me in 10 minutes. He had me send him my world that I experienced the bug in and forwarded the situation along the appropriate channels. Even if it isn't fixed in this next update, I'm not going to be here complaining because I know it will be as soon as they figure it out.\n\nBut, the devs not only communicate well with the community, they also expand on ideas and are working to make the game better than anyone could have imagined it being six months ago when I first got the game. It has absolutely evolved past what it was at that point and is well worth the asking price. I have bought several copies of this game for friends and have met many excellent builders in the game.\n\nThe UI is a little invasive at times, especially when building something from the inside. But, there are mods for that and I have little doubt that it's not something that the developer has on the to-do list. Speaking of which, if you want something that isn't in the game, you can almost always find a mod for it. The modding community is very talented and there are many coding experts that have developed tools for the game that are available to you for free.\n\nAnd, if you yourself are a coder, check out the programmable block! There is literally a block in the game that you can use C# to program scripts into to execute actions for you on your ship/ station. Not your thing? Or don't know how? Not to worry! You can use scripts from the workshop to make your creation come to life before your very eyes!\n\nWhile the game is no doubt a lot to take in and can be daunting at first glance, the workshop also has examples of ships you can build, and YouTube is littered with in-depth tutorials to get you up to speed. Not to mention the countless guides from the community that explain everything to you in text, if you prefer that to a video.\n\nAll in all, it's a dream come true for someone like myself who spent a lot of time as a kid building Lego space ships. I can't wait for the game to progress further, and it's a very safe bet that it will be the best game of its kind.","March 25, 2015","true","483.1"," 57 of 62 people (92%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","92","57","62","5","0"

At All. This is a game for people who like space, spaceships, engineering, building things and who enjoy problem solving and improving something you have build.\n\nPro's:\n\n-good dev's, passionate community, good updates.\n\n-Very nice graphics, effects need some work but they'll get there.\n\n-the basic game has allot of well thought out, community advised content and possibilities, and then you can easily add the mods in workshop to make the amount of building blocks more or less infinite.\n\nExample: basic game has rotors, pistons, armor blocks, some machines etc, giving you 100's of things to build, the mods add: variations on all that, addapted building blocks, complete overhaul of the "look" of all buildingblocks, completly new angles and shapes to work with, completly new in game mechanics like food and water, looks for your character, new weapons, improved blocks, etc etc.\n\n-Insanely devoted modding community, and they are well heared by the devs.\n\n-very good looking surroundings\n\n-endless spaceships, spacecannon, weapon, base, station, etc etc possibilities\n\n-very fun space battles with your friends\n\n-incredible efficient creative mode that allows multi-spectrum building\n\n-Single player or with friends is AWEsome fun, aswell as creative mode friends, wich is about building stuff to kill eachother :D Creative mod singleplayer is very relaxing and fun if you like builing fast.\n\n-as much game modes possible as you can devise.\n\n-VERY VERY DEPENDABLE UPDATE PROCES (very trustworthy devs) I can not stress this enough.\n\n\nCons:\n\n- very limited survivor aspect atm, building an actual ship is some serious work in survivor mode, taking hours : mining ore, refining ore, processing into components, and assembling them components into the blocks you need. Its fun if you like that sort of thing!\n\n-Again in survivor, but in the game in general: NO enemy, the only real threat in single player is  asteroids and they are not really that fun.\n\n-Only enemy or threat in the game is in multiplayer and this system has been well worked out but is not yet finished imo.\n\n-Very very very grief prone game. One of the things cripling this game is griefers going on servers, crashing ships into other ships people have worked ours on, or just spawning in giant ships to lag up the server and then leave.\n\n-Multiplayer if not with your friends or group is very limited. Take a while to build up stuff and then the server resets, dissapears or someone griefs  your base into the dust, people dont tend to come back after that.\n\n- NO npc's , no quests or happenings (only thing atm is some "ghostship" spaceships you can go chase)\n\n-not much to do in this game outside of building stuff and then using said stuff to build more stuff, for now.\n\n-Bugs, updates, patches, new bugs, alpha!\n\n\nAs long as you like building atleast as much as you like firing space weapons, this is a good game for you, if the dev's stay on track and i'm sure they will, this game has a golden future! If your not into the consequences of an early acces game dont buy it yet but come back in about a year, it will get very good i'm sure.","November 20, 2014","true","681.5"," 56 of 61 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","56","61","0","2"

It is a game of both critical thinking or great fun should you not desire to think critically about your designs, note that it is and will still be fun when you use critical thinking because that is what engineering is about. I have flown hundreds upon hundreds of kilometers and have fought many many fights both on the ground, in a small ship, and in really big ships and I have mined entire asteroids yet I still have not seen the end of creativity and possibility with this game for it is truly limitless from my experience. If you are a person who loves building things and gets a kick from blowing stuff up, then this game is for you, and I promise that you will never regret buying and playing this game, to prove it, I will put one of my experiences below.\n\nOne of the greatest experiences I've ever had while playing this game was in a multiplayer server, people were flying everywhere and fighting, some of them raming, and I had just crashed on an asteroid and had to wait for my friend to pick me up, but he did not know where I was so I had to create a beacon, which I did by taking apart an old station I found inside the asteroid, which sent out a signal saying S.O.S, this not only solved my problem of my friend not being able to find me, but it also created the problem of a bunch of playings humting me down. I was forced to retreat into the asteroid as the barrages of rockets and gunfire came down but I was just setting myself up for a trap, the entire area was closed off and the ships were able to come in, so I grabbed my drill and burrowed into the wall. As the guy was flying towards me, another person came flying in as well and so they started shooting eachothers' ships effectively destroying eachother, once they were done in their little dog fight, I managed to sneak up behind hiw to where I pulled out my assault rifle and shot the cockpit untill it exploded and killed the last guy. My friend had just gotten to the area I was at, so we scaveneged all the parts we could from the wreckage and flew off several kilometers away where we started setting up our main base living happily until a much later point where someone had their faction and came in with like 5 different large ships and totally annihilated it, and so, a new journey of revenge began but with no end. We built a whole field of "magnetic" mines around our new base and waited for someone to come, and they did.","October 16, 2015","true","434.1"," 66 of 77 people (86%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","86","66","77","23","0"

This game has everything and there is always new things to learn.\n\nWhen I first bought this game, a few days back, I was hyped to finally play this game, since I had watched several                             gameplay videos, everyone of them made me more and more interested in playing this game. But when I first launched the game, I was really disappointed, but not in the game - in myself for being so bad at the game. I didn't understand anything, how to mine and how to craft? As usual I skipped the tutorial, and after finding out there was tutorials of the game in the first place, I watched them and slowly started to learn the basics of this game. The game became really fun and I've now played 6 hours in a few days - and there will be more, alot more.\n\nThis game do really have everything, you can build fast spaceships, or if you prefer, build space stations into master pieces. There is a creative mode and a survival mode, like in minecraft, the creative mode you have unlimited resources and you can just fly around and build whatever you want. The survival mode though, is really difficult, atleast to a noob like me, and I recommend you to learn the basics before playing the survival mode, otherwise you might get angry or bored. The survival mode, however is about survive (suprise, huh?) and you have to mine to get the iron before you can craft blocks to build with. Depending which difficulty you play on, there will be meteor attacks, which problably will destroy your station(s) and ship(s).\n\nLike this isn't enough, the game do have an awesome multiplayer mode, were you can just open your offline world to either LAN and/or steam friends and/or to public. The multiplayer mode has great settings, were you can control what the players can do and cannot do. The abilty to mod this game is great, as far as I can tell, there is alot of mods and it's easy to make them and to install them, at the Space Engineers workshop (here at steam) you can download all the mods and worlds others have made, which makes the game even better.\n\nAnyhow, this game becomes funnier the more you learn and the more you play, as you get better - the game becomes funnier. If you do not own this game, but love games involving building and surviving, you should definatly buy this game.","February 19, 2015","true","6.1"," 69 of 84 people (82%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","82","69","84","16","0"

Remember what it was like early in development?  It's come a long way, hasn't it?  Well, Space Engineers is like Minecraft in Space, and it is set for a similarly drastic transformation. Almost every update brings something remarkable and new.\n\nAs of Summer 2014, they still call it an 'alpha', however the game has reached a state where it no longer feels like an unfinished 'work in progress' but more of an already complete and playable game that is still getting constant improvements and additional content from the developers. (Rather like Minecraft this last year or two.)\n\nThe physics are really awesome, crashing two large ships into eachother is sufficiently harrowing to anyone onboard. And I like how all the ship systems work...especially now that they've added the 'conveyor' systems which allow you to connect things like refineries and assemblers (Refineries turn chunks of ore into raw materials, and assemblers craft materials into the components you build with) together, along with cargo holds, so that items are just moved around automatically.  They also added blocks that 'collect' items into the conveyor system, and blocks that 'eject' items from the ship's conveyor system, allowing you to transfer cargo between ships. (Such as having a mining ship dump its ore into a refinery ship that automatically begins processing it, and assembling components from the materials.)\n\nEDIT: Almost right after I wrote this recommendation, an update added the ability for ships to physically 'dock' via a connector on the conveyor system, connecting the two ships' conveyor and electrical subsystems, and allowing control of all ship systems from either vessel. (Also works with ship/station connections)\n\nI also like the progressive construction system. When you go to place a block, it requires one unit of the most basic component; usually something like steel plate, and that creates an empty framework of the block, so you can continue laying out a basic skeleton of what you're building. Then when you go back over it with your welder to actually 'build' the block, it requires the additional components.  Things like motors, steel tubes, 'construction components', computers, etc.\n\nSurvival mode is already full of surprises, considering the fact that there's no AI or anything yet. Recently, I had this incident where I was out mining an asteroid...  I left my ship, my 'mobile base', floating above the light-side of the asteroid, and I ended up mining a deposit on the dark-side...  I get back to the ship and try to open the door...nothing.  That's when I notice none of the thrusters are on; there's no power... I quickly jet over to the other side, and the whole thing's been ripped open like a tin of sardines.  Must've been struck by a couple of micrometeorites...  Reactor was gone, refinery too... Luckily my cargohold was still intact, so I had what I needed to quickly assemble a new reactor.  I had to work fast to get power back on just to recharge my suit before I lost life support... Then the next task was going to be restoring minimal maneuvering to get the thing away from the light-side of the asteroid before there was another meteor shower...  I managed, somehow. Lesson learned; you can bet I never parked in the sun again!\n\nI still haven't played this multiplayer, it would definitely be useful to have people to help build sometimes. Any really large ships or stations are not one-person jobs.","June 24, 2014","true","127.3"," 47 of 51 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","47","51","0","1"

That is open to speculation). In other words, cut them some slack.\n\nThis game is EXTREMELY GPU and RAM intensive, i do not suggest running it with less than 8gbs, (16 recommended). Also bear in mind that some planets will refuse to load on low end GPUs and that others will run badly. For example you will run Mars at 30 odd fps on a GTX 750ti, 50-60 on a 980. Earth and the alien planet will run at 50-60 fps on a GTX 980ti (basically a titan x with less vram). I also hear that AMD cards and CPUs run worse than their Intel and Nvidia counterparts, though this is inconsitant.\n\nAs such i STRONGLY suggest you stay away from planets if you have a weaker GPU, i can manage 40fps on intel integrated graphics in space.\n\nMultiplayer is currently broken, though new netcode is on the way and indications are that it is nearly complete. Stay away from dedicated servers until it drops, private games with 2-6 people run perfectly fine for the most part, though i do not recommend using pistons and rotors, they will invoke to wrath of Clang (the patron god of Space engineers and utter ruin).\n\nThat just about covers it for the warning, i will add more as i either remember things or otherwise find out more.\n\n---------------------\n\nNow, for the actual review.\n\nSpace engineers is a semi realistic sci-fact voxel based building and exploration game (emphasis on the building part).\nIn this game you will build, mine and fight pirates (single player) and other players (multiplayer) in the hope of creating massive battleships to oppress the peasants, and defend what you own.\n\nYou can build basically any ship from movies, other games and TV series, or something original (but mostly you will end up building flying bricks due to your lack of aesthetic skill), the only limits are your imagination, and your computer.\n\nMining for resources is actually very fun in this game due to deformable terrain.\n\nThe fighting part could use a little work, but it does the job fine for the moment.\n\nThe exploration element is similar (if not somewhat superior) to that found in Elite: Dangerous, difference being the main reasons are to find a nice looking place for a base, look for resources, or if you have both, look for the community made ships that are placed extremely infrequently across the galaxy. Rather than just to have your name on a planet, though you can do that too if you really want.\n\nThe UI is, to be honest a little daunting at first, but it does the job.\n\nThe graphics are some of the best in the genre, and the models and effects are currantly being improved.\n\nThe music is decent (love the title screen song), but after a while you get a little tired of it.\n\nThe modding community is absolutely fantastic, on par if not better than the Skyrim one.\n\nInfact the community in general is superb for the most part. Probably the best i have found yet.\n\nThe game is updated every week on thursday, and hotfixes released as soon as they are finished.\n\nYoutubers for this game in general are great, i suggest VideoSage, XP gamers and W4stedspace.\n\nThat about covers it for the review.\n\nTL;DR To me this game is fantastic and has the potential to be even better, and it looks like the devs are going to deliver.\n\n8.5/10\n\nEdit: Before putting a dislike in, make a comment so I know what you disagree on and how i can help fix it.","May 21","true","126.8"," 63 of 77 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","63","77","3","18"

The ones that sucks you in and you notice its 5 am the next day.\n\nI can easilly place this next to Factorio or IC2 from Minecraft. But in space, with physics, and deformable voxel geometry thats not just cubes. Build huge ships, and wage war on multiplayer servers (of which allow it).\n\nI've spent countless of hours building stations and ships, and hosting a dedicated multiplayer server. The fact that you have to build the tools, and automation to build bigger, dig better, and generally make everything less of a chore is a very odd progression element: Of which I oddly enjoy.\n\nNow with the inclusion on random generation and infinite distances, I've enjoyed it even more. You now actually have to try to look around and find your way back to get resources, because not everything spawns on a single Asteroid.\n\nMy only gripe is the fact that the energy mechanic doesnt seem to be enough consitute this as a survivor game, yet its annoying enough to accidentally forget about it until you die and your corpse is floating about with alot of stuff: Meanwhile this isnt much of an issue after you start building ships to handle most of the heavy lifting. Why not also go further that you have to process something to make oxygen or filter CO2, etc and etc. Mods ofcourse can probably do this as well.\n\nThere are still plenty of things I havent experimented with (such as pistons or programmable blocks), but it looks like there is a lot of things you can try to create. I've seen huge projects from a mining beast that carves out a huge round cavern within an asteroid (leaving only a shell and a tiny entrence making a great asteroid for a base), to smaller utility ships that can be converted to fighters, welders or miners.\n\nI can easily recommend this game to anyone who loves building (engineering), creatively experimenting with creation of various tools / weapons (in the form of ships). Just be prepared to spend lots of hours, especially if your are into creating automation.","January 18, 2015","true","204.8"," 43 of 47 people (91%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","91","43","47","6","0"

But, what a sandbox!!! While it may seem very similar to Minecraft in essence, Space Engineers holds its own thanks to a few unique aspects:\n* SPACE! Building your own spaceship or station then go fight or race with friends is truly a thrill! Especially when creative mode offers a well-thought interface (although there would still be a few improvments to make, like a larger number of toolbars).\n* Physics! Well, it's a very similar point. Still, beyond the basics of space navigation, the included mechanics such as rotors, pistons and sensors allow wanabee inventors to (re)create astucious machineries to give some automated glory to your creations!\n* MODS! This game has been designed from the get-go to be easily modifiable, and the recent addition of ships/stations blueprints really amps the game! Between reconstruction of famous spaceships, tricky mechanics or slick self-made models, you really can spend hours just trying everything -or designing the next most popular ship on the Workshop!\n\nSo, is this game a true gem, without flaws? Unfortunately, no.\n1. This game is a resource-hog! It is very CPU demanding and can put down even quad-core if you get a bit heavy on blocks and interactions (it fully crashed my computer once when I fought with friends between half a dozen ships).\nWhile it's partially explained by the richness of interactions and creativity, everything cannot be overlooked.\nIf your computer is more than 2 years old, unless it was high-end at the time you won't enjoy it fully.\n2. Survival is basically boring for now. Only difference with creative is occasional meteor showers, keeping an eye on your internal battery, and SPENDING TWO HOURS JUST TO BUILD A SMALL SHIP ! 'Cause you'll have to drill, build a refinery, drill rare minerals, refine them, order component manufacturing and assemble them, and EVERY STEP IS RIDICULOUSLY SLOW! So unless you start in "scenarii" it's just an uninteresting waste of time...

(If you are patient/cautious, wait until it goes on sale.).\n\nSpace engineers is a block based building game, often described as minecraft in space, but with more realistic looks and physics. (Disclaimer: I have never played Minecraft because it is not in space.)\n\nIt has a creative mode, where you can comfortably just build spaceships (or bases, or vehicles) and a survival mode, where you need to mine and refine ore from asteroids or planets before you can expand beyond your starter-ship. In survival, you also need to generate energy and (unless you turn that option off) oxygen. Either way you get to build your own ship from hull to windows, doors, thrusters, gyros, antennas, refineries, cargo containers, fuel tanks, air vents, conveyors, batteries, missile launchers, landing gears (or wheels), cameras, sensors, timers, script blocks and more. Then you can fly your spaceship in an asteroid field, land on planets, set up bases, mine ores, fight pirates... Space Engineers is a sandbox game, so beyond not dying you have to set your own goals.\n\nOf course you can save the ships you have built as blueprints and upload them to the workshop or download ships built by other players. There are some fantastic creations on the workshop. Actually, if you are interested in this game at all, I recommend you just take a quick look around the workshop to see what can currently be done in Space Engineers.\n\nSpace engineers is early access and still in alpha. The developers update the game every single thursday. That update will fix some things, add some things and, inevitably in this stage, break some things. Be sure to report bugs - that is what early access is for. The devs do a hotfix every friday, so that you can enjoy the game better over the weekend.\n\nWhile the devs listen to the community - they added planets by popular demand - they have been too silent in the past. They are making an effort to improve, though.\n\nBeing alpha, the game is hardly optimzed yet, even though the devs work on that week by week, too. Older rigs may struggle with it. Performance in Singleplayer can be improved with the right settings and good judgement. Multiplayer however is currently being completely redone and perfomance varies from week to week.","April 8","true","789.6"," 47 of 57 people (82%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","82","47","57","9","3"

The Building part is super fun. The Resource gathering is interesting because you build your own ships for the Job.\nOn the other hand, the lack of content besides building and gathering can make this game pretty boring pretty fast.\nInterested in building cool spaceships or a moon base?

But, as other early access titles, there's always a shadow looming over any potentially great title: the direction its developer will take, and how they will react to an unexpected success. I loved this game back when it was... simpler. Not in its mechanics, mind you, but in its SCOPE. It was a game in which you had to hone your space engineering skills (hence the name) to make better designs, and when you managed to build a well-designed, perfectly working ship... it was glorious. I remember how proud I was of the first semi-automated mining ship I built, the smile on my face brought me back 20 years, when I was a kid playing lego and building something I liked.\n\nThen Keen Software House was hit by a wave of... success. They tried their best with their weekly update, and for some time I thought they were going in the right direction, with them adding programmable blocks and more engineering solutions to the already rich plate. Then they started trying to please everyone. Adding things most players didn't even want, failing to fix GAME BREAKING bugs, ignoring the pathetic state the multiplayer is in (completely unplayable as of now, has been like this for months).\n\nThen the dreaded PLANETS. I won't lie, I was looking forward to them. But the engine showed the game itself wasn't ready for them, and they even changed the damn system requirements after adding that feature. Fact is, even with a mid to high-end gaming pc you won't be able to reach playable frame rates. I'm using a good machine myself, and my fps (10 to 20) on planet surfaces makes the game completely unplayable. And the bugs and unneeded features just keep coming.\n\nWe have exploding CYBERDOGS now, yey, and we can mod our medical room to suit our playing stile, imagine what kind of funny stuff we could do in multiplayer - oh wait... the multiplayer is currently broken. Keen is losing sight of their own creation, trying to subtly invite us to polish the game for them via MODS... their vision of this game's future is clouded by their own inadequacy.\n\nI would NOT recommend this game to anyone right now, and I fear this might not change in the future, since the company behind it is quickly losing any credibility as a serious developer. If you're really interested in this title... well, my suggestion would be to wait. Wait and see if they can (and want to) come up with solutions to this game's long standing bugs (mining not working properly, terrible sim speed, unacceptable optimization, unplayable multiplayer) and make the right steps in order to keep the title alive. If so, I'd gladly change my review at a later date. But right now... avoid this game. It will make you think "this could have been GREAT, when and how did it go so wrong?".","January 7","false","853.1"," 317 of 503 people (63%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","63","317","503","22","47"

What is it? Imagine Minecraft having kids with space with difficulty surpassing all other games you have ever played and great modding potential. Maybe I'm overexaggerating because the game isn't that hard when you disable some stuff but trying to capture a cargo ship with automated turrets with your little fighter is hard and the space doesn't forgive. If you get shot and die it's not minecraft your stuff is gone for good and you'll not find it unless it's stationary or marked, or going really slow for some reason. You have to menage your resources well and pick your fights if you plan on fighting. There are also pirates that sometimes spawn and you have to attack their base or they'll keep sending drones and some alien NPCs like big spiders and cyberhounds. The game is updated every week and it's amazing that developers DO care. You can create a lot of different stuff in Space Engineers and you can even code in game. Space Engineers is all about usability of your creations but it doesn't stop you from building 1:1 Death Star with empty interior, it's just not as fun in my eyes as making something more... technical.\n\nControls might be confusing at first but you can remap 95% of stuff and it's great. The game has a lot of tutorials but I've never played them since I bought the game years prior to tutorials and simply watched update videos to learn the game.\nYou can play either Survival, Creative or some workshop scenarios. All modes are great. I love spawning planets in Creative with different seeds, they're so sexy, mrrr. Survival is really, really great and it has been greatly improved since I first bought into the game and made more accessible and faster for single player. Multiplayer is loads of fun and I recommend you bring friends if you plan on playing Survival because it's the best thing to do in the game. Graphics vary but there are some really cool solutions in here and it's not Minecraft level of graphics, this isn't square world - only the blocks are square 100%, destruction of ships is really great and blocks do not destroy instantly like said MC - destruction looks very real and ramming mothership with other mothership into a side is fu**ing omhack fapfapfap.\n\nI really enjoy the soundtrack. Both battle music and the slower pace tunes are good.\nThe game truly has a lot to offer and you can build a lot of different vehicles or even make a small ship into a guided rocket or a turret. The game is still a little bit buggy but recent updates are all about bugfixes and optimization.\nOn the topic of optimization it's not really that great but it's hard to tell why. It's just not always good but even in world with 25 planets I'm k but when I eg. land on a planet or spawn a really big fu**ing ship then it might not be as good. And I have a very good PC soo yea it's sad. The game is loads of fun alone or with friends, creative or survival, map making or building sh*t, fighting with motherships or raiding an NPC vessel with fighters. I recommend you support the devs, the game is really worth it even though it's not perfect. Remember, you can only play planets if your video card supports DX11. Otherwise the game is playable in DX9.\n\nThe Dark Souls sandbox in space with great modding support I've always wanted\n96/100.\n\n+ for:\nCustomizability\nLots of options to create advanced mechanisms\nMultiplayer, SP, Creative, Sandbox, Scenario mode (community made maps/vanilla maps/map making)\nSoundtrack\nPlanets are stunning to look at\nThe game is fair but hard if you want it to be\nGreat modding support\nWeekly updates that do indeed add stuff and fix stuff (progress of the game)\nPhysics (destruction and all the other stuff that makes the game more difficult to build vehicles capable of flying above planet's surface etc. it's all so cooool)\nYou can make everything out of this game\nVery tactical with where you set up your base to defend it more easily and to avoid meteor storms, battling cargo ships, managing resources and trying to stay alive and with oxygen etc. (unless you turn these features off)\n\n- for:\nOptimization (big -)\nSome major Scenario features I'd love to see there are still missing\nMultiplayer code isn't as great as it could've been\nThey deleted ladders years ago and they're out of the game since then... guys give up with your gravity elevators and stairs we just want fricking ladders.\nCrashes (sometimes)\nNo water on planets (only ice)\nThis isn't a great FPS regardless of having Assault Rifles (lackluster shooting with your astronaut/space engineer altough still being worked on and it keeps getting better)\n\nThe money you invest now is the money you'll get back in fun time pretty quickly and even more money over time since with each update game becomes more expensive and it's getting better and better so it's definetely worth to buy it because it's 99/100 material and 100/100 if they CAN and WILL MANAGE to make the optimization great.\n\n","March 8","true","197.9"," 39 of 47 people (83%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","83","39","47","4","1"

On one hand there are things about this game that are amazing, which I get excited about, on the other hand I find there are just so many problems and bugs which are holding the game back.\n\nI'll start with the negatives. This game is very poorly optimised. I know this game has a lot to render, but the framerate on planets is less than satisfactory even with a reasonably strong PC running on low settings. Planets offer the most interesting gameplay currently, so it's a shame to have to deal with this issue. (I do understand this is an early access game, and optimisation usually comes later in the development cycle, I'm merely commenting on the current state of the game). I usually play on a private server with a small group of friends. During our time playing we have encountered a variety of bugs and frustrations. One of the worst was after a few days building a station on a planet, it decided to flip, damaging or destroying much of our work. This was immensely frustrating, especially as we were also dealing with occasional crashes to both client and server. We also had issues with turrets targeting dogs and just shooting our station instead, causing damage. Not to mention the dogs themselves, which seem to spawn randomly and appear with not much warning. They seem very simple and could do with work. I also find the UI to be a but clunky, but that may be more down to personal preference.\n\nThat aside, this game has a lot of very nice features. The planets are huge and impressive to see, even though they haven't been in the game too long. The physics in the game is good and the technical side to building ships and stations has plenty of depth, whilst still leaving room for creativity. The resource gathering system is cool too, starting with basic hand drills, up to large mining ships, there is really no limit to how far you can go with this game, as long as you have the time.\n\nIn summary, this game has plenty of impressive core features but is plagued by frustrating bugs, features and poor optimisation which are currently holding it back. I am highly confident this game will be an amazing experience at some point in the future, but a little patience may be required.\n\nPros:\n-Planets\n-Good physics\n-Good ship/station building mechanics\n-Mining\n\nCons:\n-Bugs, some severe\n-Crashes\n-Dogs are a bit simple\n-Poor optimisation\n\nFinal verdict:\n4.9/10\nMaybe pick it up on sale to give it a test, otherwise stay patient maybe until it comes out of early access.\n\n~edited to fix a few spelling errors","March 11","false","51.0"," 221 of 351 people (63%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","63","221","351","12","46"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/244850/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSpace Engineers is a sandbox game about construction, engineering, and maintenance of objects in space. This includes small ships, large ships, space stations, and platforms. It features a simple crafting system, jetpacks, survival and creative modes, as well as multiplayer! Space Engineers is developed by Keen Software House,  the same team behind Miner Wars.\n\nThe game revolves around the player collecting resources from the asteroids and rocks floating out in space. To reach them you can utilize either a ship you've built (or started with) or your trusty jetpack. Once you've reached a location, you can then scout out materials and begin mining them. Once you have sufficient resources, you can then craft things such as a cockpit, thrusters, a gyroscope, a gravity generator, and reactors...all of which are required for building a ship. Multiplayer can be quite challenging, as it will have you coordinating with other players to build large stations and ships for moving and storing items as you establish a base of operations and then go out and find new sources of ore and materials.\n\nEverything in this game is destructible. And I mean EVERYTHING. What you've built, what your friend has built....even your friend! If your ship is about to crash into a station, you can do your best to evade but you will most likely fail, and destroy half of the station AND the ship. And the thing is that the developers actually put the effort into that! The destructed objects look very realistic and look like they had some thought put into hnow they would look if destroyed a certain way (Rammed by a ship for example)! Fly a ship into another ship and check it out. Broken objects, pieces of metal, and more will all be floating away through space after a stellar impact.\n\nSpace Engineers is currently still in Alpha, and is available on Steam via the Early Access program. While it is still very early in its life, Space Engineers is very playable, and a blast to play with a few friends. Get a few together, grab a four-pack of the game, and you will definitely get share of fun from this game.\n\nRecommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","November 1, 2014","true","23.4"," 50 of 67 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","50","67","0","0"

I remember when Workshop integration was added, within days there were tens of THOUSANDS of worlds on the workshop. And when official modding was introduced, the community (and myself) went absolutely CRAZY! Modding opened up whole new worlds (sometimes literally) for this game. Also, I find myself enjoying the multiplayer a LOT more (screw you rammers, though) simply because of the numerous fixes and improvements they've made to it. Even now, this is one of the few games I would've payed the usual 50-60$ for, but it's a steal at only 20$. And the devs! Keen Software House have to some of the most dedicated game developers I've ever seen, releasing content-filled updates EVERY THURSDAY since launch, never missing one. I heard recently that this game is also going to be in retail stores and for download on the Xbox One. Now, if you can get your game on that big of a platform, you're doing something right.\nI really can't wait to see where the future takes this game and KSH.\nSo, overall, 12/10","December 4, 2014","true","626.2"," 29 of 32 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","29","32","0","0"

How do you go against that?\n\nWell, here's how I do it.\n\nSpace Engineers is a fantastic game if you're prepared to play a local, single player game. It works quite well, with only a reasonably small amount of bugs for an Alpha game.\n\nSpace Engineers is a terrible game if you'd like to play a dedicated server, multiplayer game. It barely works, with a large array of game breaking bugs for an Alpha game. Furthermore, some deliberate design decisions by Keen will ensure that sooner or later, entire ships, cargo and inventory are lost, and done so on a regular basis.\n\nOverall, I'd really like to like this game - and if playing forever by myself was an option, I reckon I'd love it. However, until the cheap and fatally flawed multiplayer code can be fixed (or completely dumped and replaced with something that works) and until some key design decisions can be reversed that stop penalising players for the frequent disconnections induced by said multiplayer code, this is a game whose multiplayer capabilities are best expressed in abstract terms only.","March 20","false","532.4"," 231 of 373 people (62%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","62","231","373","19","56"

I'm a huge Minecraft fan and always wanted something that looked a bit better and gave me even more freedom. I found that with Space Engineers. The building system is great and the mod support is epic! There are so many things that can be build within the game and using added mods. I regularly play with 100+ mods added to the game.\n\nNow, with the added planetary support, it has just become my favorite game. I never really get tired of playing this game. It's an awesome builder with a dev team that really enjoys what they are doing with the game.\n\nThe only downside to the game is it's graphics compatibility issues. It seems that every other update breaks lighting or voxel viewing. That can pose an issue when float through space and you smash into invisible asteroids or when you are deep in a mine on a planet and your helmet lights only half work.

Although it's not yet fully released, it already features a great deal of content.\nIf this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.\n\nNote: I played this game when I was on vacation with no internet so playtime and achievements were not registered for some reason. It was a nice vacation, though.\nWhat is happening in the game:People would tell you that it's basically Minecraft in space and they wouldn't be wrong. You can build ships and bases, fly around and mine. What to do in the game is basically your choice, as in all sandbox games.\n\nPros:    There are both survival and creative mode. As you can assume, creative mode is for creating, without any real danger you would need to deal with. Survival mode, on the other hand, need a bit more skill when playing, as you have to be careful not to die or lose the energy, there are meteor showers ...\nOf of the best things in the game is Workshop integration. With 120k+ user-created items submitted, it is obvious that the game is fun enough for that many gamers to post their own creations. There is everything: ships, characters, asteroids ... you name it.\nA pretty good tutorial introduces you nicely to many features in the game, even the basic movement ones, if you've never played any games before.\nSome reviews say that this game is abandoned by the developer, however, there are regular updates coming out about twice a month.\nEven though I'm pretty sure it's not very realistic, it still gives the impression of being like that. Space battles and stuff like that is of course not transferred from the real life, but other content might very well be.\nA part I'm very thrilled about is in-game programming. You use C# language to write scripts.\nFor a game in Early Access there is a ton of content and things to do. Reminded me of Prison Architect. Impressive.\nCons:    The price is pretty high for an Early Access game. You should at least put the price a bit lower for the testers! It is true, however, that this game has been bundled twice already (at the time of writing this review).\nBuilding stuff takes a long time, ruining it takes seconds. There is Workshop for the lazy people, though.\nDespite having relatively low system requirements, this game runs slower than it should. I believe they're going to fix that before they get out of Early Access.\nNo Linux and MacOS support. I am not familiar with what engine they're using for this game, but most modern ones support other platforms than Windows.\nThe final verdict:If you are one of the people who love sandbox games (not everybody do), you should consider getting this game. Even though it's in EA, it has tons of content, Workshop support for a few more tons of content and more features will be coming with future updates. The game is fun, not that buggy and it includes both creative and survival mode.\nI've played Space Engineers a lot already, some people even spent hundreds of hours on it, in case you're worried about how many hours this games can offer.\nFor people who like sandboxes, this is certainly a recommended game.\n\nFurther reading:    Store page\nFeatures[www.spaceengineersgame.com]\nSpace Engineers Wiki[www.spaceengineerswiki.com]\nGameplay on Youtube\nGreetings,\nBirdCute\n\nNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes.

It is in Early Access game with quite a bit of content and more is being added on constantly.\n\nWhat is in the game?\nThis is an open sandbox game with lots to explore, it is not your typical sandbox game, it is a unique sandbox-space game. There is lots to do, you can build spaceships, explore outerspace, build space stations, have ship fights with friends in your almost fully destrutible enviroment.\n\n\nIs this game worth the money? Personally I think it is worth it, there is so much to do in this game, there is two game modes, Survival and Creative. Pretty self explanatory but Survival is where you are trying to gather your supplies and trying to survive and create your spacestation, but in creative you get to create your own spaceship or spacestation or whatever you want to make with all the tools at your fingertips.\nYes the game is a bit expensive 25$ at the moment, it did go up recently from 20$ if you dont want to spend that much then just wait for a sale when it will be much cheaper.\nThe game is fun but even more fun with some friends to mess around with.\n\nPros Huge Workshop, there are over 150 thousand workshop submissions from Spacestations, Spaceships, and all kinds of machines.\nRegular updates to the games, some great devolopers working on this game they update 1-2 times a month.\nGreat game there is so much to do, you can have huge space battles with friends, build an army of spaceships, have races in fast spaceships, build a deathstar.\nThere is a great high detailed tutorial that helps you figure out this game which can be pretty complicated at first.\n\nCons\nAgain this game is a bit expensive, 25$ is quite expensive for some people but it does go on sale and when it does you should get yourself a copy and maybe one for a friend.\nThe controls for flying ships are a bit hard but once you get used to them it becomes more enjoyable.\nIt does take a while to build stuff and can be challenging and frustrating when a friend or someone or even yourself destroys your creation in a matter of seconds\n\nMy final thoughts and opinion of Space EngineersThis game is still in Early Access and is one of the better sandbox games i have seen and played so far. There is 100s of hours of gameplay to offer and maybe even thousands. There is plenty of mods to try out and play. There isnt very many gamebreaking bugs (or none that i have found or heard of) but the developers are always updating and patching bugs. This is a great game for early access and i am excited to see what is to come later, i highly recommend this game to fans of sandbox games, and fans of building games.","September 16, 2015","true","3.5"," 44 of 60 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","44","60","3","1"

It was the foundations from which I wanted to become a game developer and 3D artist. And I have seen it grow since it's inception.\nThere are very good reasons why this game is as highly rated and prized for it's gameplay and development, and also as much reasons why it is still following the early access model.\nAs I am writing this, it has been a few months since I had a long session of building and interacting with the community. The long hours I made in this game and the great people I met on the workshop and forums are the reasons I am still coming back. This game is a timesink, but the reasons why you play differ per player. I am of the creative sorts and love sharing my creations on the workshop. Others may jump into a survival server and love the interaction and building together with friends or anyone at all.\nThe game has a solid foundation, with a lot of potential, yet a lack of polish. That is now written of as 'early access' yet it also seems that the focus of SE lies on the core mechanics, and allowing their players and dedicated modders to expand on the assets, code and additional features one would find in competitor games.\n\nI myself have never indulged myself in the survival and multiplayer scene in the way SE presents it to their players. I prefer working in self made scenarios and creating the sandbox environment as a filming studio. Making machinimas or just a show and tell.\n\nI have had a blast with this game, yet sometimes you need a break to rewind your creative gears. I have had a break of a few months before, and when my time is plenty again, I will definitely get back building!\n\nPros\nUnique physics and deformation engine\nContinues updates and community feedback\nUnlimited value if you are into sandbox games and space. (2000 hrs and counting)\nMultiplayer\nModding support.\nMany other things.\n\nCons\nTerrible User interface\nLack of Polish in models, characters, variety and depth of existing game elements\nA lot of work arounds and limitations in gameplay. In the form of artificial maximum speeds and stopping physics calculations at certain speeds.\nMultiplayer is not reliable (Netcode is not done on the moment of writing this)\nMany other things aswell halas.\n\nFinal Verdict\nIt is a platfrom perfect to continue your creativity and physics nonsense you expect from other sandbox games.

Designing your own stuff is easy there, weapons do not require ammo to fire, blocks are buildable fast.\n\nYou can use mirroring to build faster, modify the level to your liking by deforming asteroids or placing objects, copy and paste parts on each other, use all kinds of mechanical parts, or a programming block to create whatever you imagine. But the biggest fun is to actually design in creative, save it as a blueprint, and rebuild it in survival conditions, or use your own spaceship design in a custom match.\n\nCreative gives you all the abilities to get to know the game engine. Not everything you can play in singleplayer will make a lot of sense in multiplayer, and you can create abonimations like life sized ships, use thousands of mods to make them beautiful and even host it for a few players to look around.\n\nSurvival\nSurvival is the basic new trend in sandbox games, once you learn how to survive, you also learn how resources are limited, and how the players are balanced in a MP setting. Surviving in space needs energy and oxygen atm. - you need to mine asteroids, refine the materials, build new materials, and each component you would build in creative with a click needs a lot more work.\n\nSince you can die, or stuff which explodes might be lost, your energy might run out, or your oxygen, survival gives it's own long term struggles, but does not really hinder you to establish yourself, and concentrate on tasks at hand.\n\nTherefore the refining and assembling is not as complicated as in games dedicated to this, but still complicated enough that a question which you never asked yourself suddenly pops up, and makes you realize, your current design philosophy with all its glory has also its weaknesses.\n\nThere is little more to say, it's only a step, if you cannot entertain yourself, you might want more... so more to come...\n\nScenarios\nAtm. introduced, scenarios and modding are a big focus of Keen. Designing your own level, like it's a game within a game, and playing it with friends, or publishing it and become famous on workshop are their own achievement. However, be warned, this part of the game is still under construction.\n\nThe Space MMO dream?\nWith the coming introduction of planets, the introduction a new rewritten netcode, and the developers going public with sourcecode (so you can help fix bugs or have it easier to create mods on github), and also the efforts in AI "research" from the publisher, it seems clear, that sandbox worlds are a dream of the dev team, aswell as the player base.\n\nCurrently however, you should not expect a full online game experience.\n\nCurrent state critique\nI have little critique. It is the first C# app, I do not dismiss, simply because it's written in a virtual machine language, something I do not want game engines written in personally; I can see a lot of struggles ahead for the devs, but they seem keen (pun intended) on facing those obstacles. I can only say, if they keep up their energy, and dedication, this game will slowly evolve into an absolute classic. That said, it runs well, but of course also eats resources, if you give it more. Like basicly every physics game; graphics and effects are decent, as is FPS.\n\nThis being said, it's of course directx only, so windows/xbox based, with still a rudimentary hackish netcode, and no sandbox servers, database stuff etc, and especially not for linux, to make it really able to create medium sized communities for your own "little spacegame". There are servers which try to make larger games than 4-6 players possible, but actually, it is not something you want to play now. However, since there is much to do until that is all ready, and still core features to come, I would hop on now, than later; it is more than worth it's money in fun, and offers you especially if you have a geeky heart or a fable for lego or lego technic, a lot, especially if you like to invest time "behind the game".\n\nIt is also great for kids, since the game does not focus on violence, much less than minecraft anyway, while it also does not completely "conceal its possibility".\n\nHave I said, that you can smash ships you built with copy paste to see them explode? This should be all the arguments you need. If you quickly want to do something in a virtual world, this is one of the most ideal games for it. You might even just build a conference center for youtube videos or create machinimas with it - if you are the creative player, who wants to design, this game is already in a very finished state. For everyone who waits for the online experience, I can understand if it stays on the whishlist. But definitely, it deserves a spot there.","June 22, 2015","true","564.0"," 32 of 40 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","32","40","0","0"

At KSH this is the result of a full week of work. Oh and also they add bug-fixes to the changelog, but that doesn't mean that those bugs are fixed, just that it says so in the changelog.

Lets keep this linear and within the bounds of reason.

Early on, there was great progress, along with many new features that needed refining.\n\nIn very early 2014 I downloaded a cracked version of SE to test it out. 400 hours later I bought the game to help support and add my constructive criticisms to improve the game. Rotors, Pistons, and so much more was added!\n\nThrough many of the requests by players, we got many additions and other grand features, like warp drive, batteries, sensors, and much more.\n\nNETCODE --- Players asked for better multiplayer netcoding, we got BLOCK COLOURS... This adding of "Flash and flare" as I call it, has done nothing but satiate the players who can't see past their own noses. This "flash and flare" has been a constant method of Keen to satiate EVERY request for multiplayer netcoding along with "Soon".\n\nWell.. We are now nearly 2 years down the line, the game is BEYOND playable in terms of multiplayer. Simulation speeds will drop to .3 - .2 with few physics operations.\n\nPLANETS --- No doubt a big deal. They are very impressive! Well, until you realize that you CAN NOT play on them. Search youtube for "Planetary Holes". Since then, we got exploding Cyborg Dogs... Really? More flash and flare to distract the simple-minded players from the ABYSMAL quality of multiplayer.\n\n1 year ago I had a relatively stable world with 2 large 800 meter asteroids that I generated for my dedicated server and the community that played. The forums run by Keen were flooded with players and groups and communities with lavish ideas and doing everything they could to encourage improvements for this game.\n\nSince then, Keen has done nothing but ALIENATE the valuable playerbase they first had. Read the replies for each weekly update, dating as far back as possible. The vast majority of the players have left, along with countless multiplayer communities. The comments have degenerated into useless "Thanks!" replies along with the "Negative Constructive Criticism" from the few valuable players who still cling to the hope that Keen will eventually fix this game.\n\nThe final interaction I will have with Keen and their products after this review is posted, is to wipe it from my personal computer as well as my dedicated server once and for all.\n\nFor a game with such grand potential, Keen has squandered it, and lost their most valuable resource - THE LOYAL PLAYERS WHO STUCK THROUGH THE FIRST YEAR OF MAJOR ISSUES. Now you are held up by fanboys parading "THANKS!" on each weekly update instead of the QUALITY that you first demonstrated.

It's worth buying at a later date, however, when major bugs in MP and SP will be resolved. The constant instability of the game due to new bugs introduced every week is going to turn you off from playing it. That's why this review is negative. Space Engineers needs to have more stable updates, and bugs must be at least not evident the moment we start the game. Early access can exscuse most of them, but some don't need even testing to be seen, and those are not exscusable.\n\nI am confident that in the upcoming months major bugs will eventually be resolved, and thus I recommend SE at a later date or at discounted price.","April 18","false","775.6"," 71 of 111 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","71","111","3","4"

It already has numerous features like a conveyer system and different shaped blocks (like wedges) which minecraft can't do without mods.\n\nAt this time, there are no bad guys to fight/ challeges to complete in solo mode. Like minecraft, the "survival" part of the game ends pretty quickly. In minecraft, you build a farm and a house with a bed. In Space Engineers, you build a little station and get some uranium/solar panels. Survival is trivial. After that, the game becomes about gathering resources and building bigger and better ships.\n\nLike minecraft, multiplayer is where the possibilities really open up. There are tons of active multiplayer servers. This game even has a server browser! Also there's already an active modding community. I expect to see a lot of great mods in the future.\n\nThe game is still early in development but there's plenty of entertainment to be had for the price.

Seriously, You build a station? Expect it to fly off into the distance while you desperatly chase it becasue it spazzed when you docked a ship in it. Did you build a ship?

Until recently, Space Engineers was a game I would play heavily for a month or so, and then put down for an indefinite amount of time until I got the itch to build a sci-fi wet dream all over again. About two months ago, I heard that there was some talk about putting planets into the game, and I decided to ease myself back into the mechanics before the launch of the new update, which proved to be counter-intuitive as the update changed everything I knew about the game.\n\nThe Review\n\nAs the mechanics of the game itself have heavily changed since the introduction of planets, this section will cover my thoughts post-update. Planetary gravity has revolutionized everything about the way this game is played from the ground up. When I first loaded up my new world, I found myself amidst the derelict husk of a spaceship in the middle of the night somewhere on the face on an earthlike planet, out of broadcasting range of my friends. We initially spent the first two hours discovering we were out of range of the strongest beacons, and that we couldn’t seem to build a ship strong enough to escape the planets gravity, much less keep them upright during the building process. Eventually we discovered that it all came down to mass, center of gravity, and the angle at which we tried to escape the atmosphere.\n\nThis is what draws me to launching this game every night, the sudden tangibility of the  world  solar system post-update. You can easily lose a ship you spent hours assembling due to a misplaced thruster, crashing into a planet leaving nothing but a crater behind. The map spaces are so large that you can lose your base, your friends, and all sense of direction. The core difference between gameplay as it exist now compared to a year ago, is that you frequently have to build something to address a crisis, and not just because you want to.\n\nDespite all of the positives this game brings to the table, it does struggle with some graphical and physics based glitches. While most of these boil down to minor annoyances in the grand scheme of the game, there have been moments when these issues have rendered my game unplayable.\n\nIt would be a travesty to discuss what makes this game great without touching on the fantastic modding community attached to it. The people who love this game have created everything from small physics fixes to gigantic rail canons capable of punching a whole through practically anything. You would be missing out if you didn't browse through the Steamworkshop for this title.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nThis game provides a form of sci-fi fantasy fulfillment rooted in compelling physics, and a fantastic community. While this is not a game for the easily frustrated, as it suffers from a variety of technical and graphical glitches, I have found that almost any question I have is answered shortly by a quick browse through the forums, and the developer has frequently implemented changes derived from player feedback (i.e. the planets update). If you are willing to invest the time to learn the games physics and nuanced mechanics, the payoff is worth it.\n\nGood fit for: Sci-fi fans, Simulator junkies, Creative types. Bad fit for: Fast-paced gamers, Glitch haters.","November 25, 2015","true","109.8"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","22","26","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NamelessOblivion/recommended/244850/","NamelessOblivion","Nameless Oblivion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NamelessOblivion/","275 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis review is of the Early Access (pre-release) version of the game, current as of 10/13/2014, and pertains almost exclusively to the Survival mode of the game.\n\nEarly access it may be, but Space Engineers is worth a look if you enjoy builders (eg. Minecraft-style) games. I've spent much of the past weekend mining, refining, assembling, and then building the components of various ships and devices, to much enjoyment. Flight is Newtonian, jetpacks are standard, and the freedom of flight on top of the construction mechanics is enjoyable.\n\nHowever, like most builder games, Space Engineers has a large element of resource collection and extraction. In this case, it's also part of the charm - there's nothing like building your first tunnel-boring machine and using it to core right through an enormous asteroid - but expect to spend some time mining if you're not simply playing creative mode. That means some relatively mundane mining - whether it's small scale mining by hand, or large scale resource extraction. It also means finding ores, but the game provides tools for this (ore detectors, lights, and conveyor/connector systems) to permit a player to facilitate this as much as possible mechanically without actually removing it.\n\nWhen creating a survival mode world, give some consideration to your intended style of play. For instance, the game offers the opportunity to let welding (construction), grinding (deconstruction), refining (ores into ingots), assembly (ingots into components), and general inventory size be faster, more efficient, or simply larger. These changes can alter a survival mode game into something much more like the creative mode, or allow a single player to have the ability to move the ores and components of ten men when multiplayer is not available. None of this will stop a single player from playing as they wish, but it will have an impact on the level of tedium a player may have to ignore or overcome to enjoy the game.\n\nFull disclosure: I'm currently playing a "all settings realistic" Lone Survivor start, where I've gotten my first mining barge up and running despite starting with nothing more than a hand drill and the basic machines needed to process ores and materials. There's a sense of satisfaction attached to starting with "nothing" and bootstrapping yourself into an effective spot.\n\nAs it's early access, the only "threat" the game proivides is in the form of wandering mostly-passive cargo vessels (turrets ahoy) to attack, scrap, or plunder (optional and default to off), or metor swarms hammering your landing pads and ships. Metors can be avoided easily by building some basic armor for your stations, or building them in the shadow of the rocks, but on the highest settings you'll be hard pressed to avoid the constant barrage of rock from above.\n\nI'd recommend this - but keep in mind it's a lot like Minecraft. Sandbox and passive play is the order of the day, not frenetic action. (Though, the game certainly seems to support it, with gatling guns and rocket pods along with its assault rifles and jetpacks.) It's a much more spartan and simple affair than its learning curve will initially indicate, but there's plenty of sand from which to build your castle-in-the-sky.","October 13, 2014","true","589.4"," 27 of 35 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","27","35","0","0"

To my delight the development team has been really hard at work with releasing updates which more often than not contain noticeably good tweaks to content and optimization. Updates are seen at a regular interval of about twice a month and if there's one thing I learned from fooling myself into getting Starforge and watching the progress of Starbound it's that steady updates are king and there's nothing more irritating that developers who spend more time talking about how great the game will be when it's finished than they do working on the game. As with any early access game there's still a lot of work to be done; the most recent update was as a fantastic jump on optimization which allows for collisions to be made without losing literally all of your frames for a few seconds but the Survival mode which was also implemented with it is still at a lackluster state where it's only really worth checking out if you want to demo what will soon come around.

This game had tons of potential only to fall short due to bugs that never get fixed or never stay fixed (pistons for one).\n\nThey seem more interested in adding more features vs fixing all the deep issues this game has. It's nearly impossible to have a stable server with a player count over 8 to 10 people if they are all active mining/whatever.\n\nIn my opinion they should get the game as stable as they can then add features after that, but logging in and having bookmarks/ships/whatever up and disappear for no good reason makes it hard to play multiplayer.\n\nTo even think about hosting a half way stable server you have to run third party tools like server extender even then you have to jump through a lot of hoops. I couldn't tell you why keen didn't hired the person who made Server Extender, the server end would be a bit better if they did.\n\nI usually get a itch for the game every so often and will play for a bit until I cant deal with the bugs anymore and quit for a while hoping they fix it at some point only to keep being repeatedly disappointed.\n\nIf you catch it under $10 on sale and want to gambling it will turn into something better go for it. With keens past history I hope they just dont release the xbox version and bail out on us. We shall see.\n\nWith all the negative comments I have posted above I will say when the game works with out crashing or pistions killing you and your entire family its unlike any other game thats out.\n\nMy expectations of a great space engineers game would be to have at least 30 people doing whatever they want with in reason and no lag/slow down on the server.\n\nBut go look for yourself if you have it pull up a server list see how many servers have 15 or more people in them, not many.","April 8","false","705.3"," 48 of 73 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","48","73","0","2"

Because of the amount of complexity, you can also create your own 'game modes', if you put your mind to do it - moreso than unmodded Minecraft. The physics are 'real' - you'll have to worry about gravity, structural integrity, damage, and momentum. Flying your first ship is a thrilling experience; being crushed or slingshotted by a stray piece of dismantled ship or space trash is, as well.

The game offers two modes - Survival and Creative - both allow you to build your own space ships and space stations, one of which actually requiring you to mine, refine, and assemble materials into parts before welding them into your ship.\n\nThe game is a little slow and meaningless if you play it by yourself but if you can find some friends to share a base with, and create factions to fight each other, the game is very entertaining due to the number of possibilities. The limited number of game functions at the moment is offset by the Workshop, which seamlessly (YES, NO ISSUES!) integrates hundreds of new blocks and backgrounds into the game without a hickup, only requiring a slightly longer load time. If you can manage to find people you like (or hate) to play the game with you, you will have a blast. However, single player doesn't offer too many fun possibilities, as building a ship doesn't really accomplish anything without having something to use it for - you will be alone in space in the most literal sense.\n\nWhile it lacks some more advanced mechanics calculations and possibilities for real engineers, it does offer those with a knack for programming and configuring controls the opportunity to customize features and design complex mechanisms to accomplish various tasks ranging from opening a door to operating a complex automated train line. It is a load of fun when you design things you can show off to other players (and attack them with), but be prepared to not be very useful at the beginning - some things aren't too intuitive, and PvP can be brutal.","December 19, 2014","true","100.2"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","0"

They added them!\n\nThe community is awesome as well, however, like any community there is the bad part of it. Try creating a public creative server, it won't work too well, it'll just have spammers. At least until mod api supports more. Aside from the creative servers, you can find a community you love being around, just takes time to find one.\n\nMissing content to the game? Look to the modding community, there is tons and tons of content created for the game.\n\nPros:\n- Infinite worlds, just explore or create a huge empire.\n- PLANETS!!! They are beautiful in every way, they're just gigantic, I mean like... MASSIVE. Oh, and... The best part, The ENTIRE planet can be destroyed, sure that takes up a lot of resources, but its possible. You could make a hole from 1 side to another.\n- Building mechanics are awesome, many decoration mods to make ships feel like they're actually a space ship.\n- Enjoyable if you play with your friends, teamwork can make things a lot faster.\n- The game sort of has a goal now, starting on a planet, and moving up into space, and jump drives being end game. The alien planet is far away, and is dangerous and very exciting to be on, and be eaten alive!\n- Planets do not support DX9, why is this a Pro? Because DX9 is like extremely old and outdated.\n\nCons:\n- The game is getting better at optimization, still laggy, but getting better. Consider the scale of the game, and what it has now.\n- Some patches released can break the game a bit, but generally they're getting better, after all, it still is Alpha.\n- The game pushes limits, so don't expect it to run on your 2005 dell computer, it's not going to. The game requires nice hardware, but at the same time, the game is pushing the limits by adding  content that has never been done before.","December 18, 2014","true","145.4"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","17","19","3","0"

Space Engineers has a lot of promise. First however, it needs a lot of fixing. Server side I am aware of a nominally fixed memory leak caused by voxel updates (we think, hard to be sure). Not ACTUALLY fixed, despite patch notes: our server admin has tested this thoroughly.\n\nClient side... I don't know where to begin. Sometimes my oxygen won't replenish, or my energy, when sitting in a pod with both supplied. Sometimes objects literally destroy themselves while I build them. Just now I lost almost two hours of solid work because things I build don't always default to BELONGING TO ME.\n\nMy advice is pretty simple. Wait until the devs iron out most of these things before giving them money for the project. Currently it is frustratingly prone to glitchy behavior, and while the game is playable you will see tons of things go wrong.\n\nTl;dr, Dark Souls 3 is more rewarding and less frustrating than this.

You should start building a ship, or a miner, etc, off the start as you need some sort of transportation instead of the rescue ship.\nYou need to be very patient with the crashes you get all the time and how laggy the game can be, also gotta be patient with your progress and how complicated things can be, I recommend watching a tutorial on the game, anyways.\nI would rate this game overall an 7/10 due to its many crashes and lag spikes, once this has a few patches I'm going to edit this review.","August 12, 2014","true","22.5"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","21"

Sadly, it's overall EXTREMELY buggy, unbalanced and it does not perform in multiplayer, not even with a state-of-the-art-super-server (180-500$/month) and it seems that this game will never finish.\nIn Singleplayer there isn't really anything to do besides building stuff, but everything you build bugs/corrupts. It's really terrible. Some bugs are as old as the first public release... That alone should say something about this company.\n\nThey have fantastic ideas. But their ideas are too big to materialise and they have this habbit of adding more 'ideas' before even prototyping/finishing the previous ones.\n\nRestrictions & LimitationsOriginally posted by Silver:In sandbox games you want to build, be creative and be free.\nBut the freedom is limited by the server performance which is killed really easy w/o rules that limit your freedom.Yes servers MUST apply serious restrictions to all players (like deleting all ships with more than x blocks). And yet you can still crash any server you want without hacking/cheating. But you can't even make a medium-sized-battleship without crashing or at the very least lagging out even the most expensive and modern servers.\nAnother example: there is a hidden block limit for each ship, exceeding it will cause a crash. Official reply from Keen stated (literal copy-paste): "We will try to take a look at it. But it will not probably be fixed.".\n\nSingleplayer is a lot more stable and performs better but it's still pretty bad.\n\nPlanetsThe new planets release only made things worse. EVERYTHING I touch bugs.  You literally die from jumping on a flat surface or touching a players corpse.\nOne hour of playing, over 10 serious (as in corruption, server crashes, ships blowing up, etc) bugs and at least 2 exploits. 2 years in alpha + years of development + 8 figures in budget and still a big mess. They still release patches and updates that are totally flawed instead of waiting until they get it right. After playing some more hours the amount of bugs becomes extremely annoying.\n\nServer Performance, no matter what you do...At capped FPS, at max server simspeed, with the server using less than (literally) 1/10th of it's resources the game still becomes a slideshow with more players. The whole optimization is totally absent after years and years of development.\nServers are unable to perform no matter the hardware you put in it. And in singleplayer you can make it perform to a certain degree using mods. But those break roughly every week and I noticed that my machine is still rendering lights and blocks that it can't possible see. Even after the planets update...\n\nBut there is so much more...There are so many more problems (like the weekly updates that introduce more bugs than fixes and that break the mods you need to get around existing bugs...) and pages filled with bug-listings. But it's too much to all sum up in a review.\n\nProject management & communicationI seriously frown upon how they manage their project in Keen. It's all done extremely unprofessionally, even for an Indie team. Also the questions asked during streams seem pre-made, too politically correct and the important questions are ignored (and most likely not fixed/implemented).\n\nExample: We suffer for so long from a rapidly increasing world filesize on servers. They can grow very fast and makes connecting to the server insanely slow (which can grow in just 1 day to the point where it gets nuts) with no build-in way to decrease it.\nHowever, at 15 january 2016 Marek in the live-stream about the "roadmap Q&A" hears about this for the very first time... Now I know why they never solved that issue before and why he plans on creating persistent servers without fixing this first (among others)... Their management appeared to be unaware of such very important issues even though it has been reported many times over the last 2 years... But yet they are the ones creating the 'todo-list' and the priorities for 2016...\n\nThe people who see nothing and blame 'my pc' for itIt works for me! I have (almost) no bugs! Game is fine, must be those other people!Our server runs just fine. I don't see the 'big' problem.Maybe try having more than 2 people on the server, use more complex blocks and more complex designs. And pray that people who are like that, never join your server. Or people who know the bugs&exploits and who can crash your server anytime they feel like it through legal means. Don't use programmable blocks, don't use rotors, don't drill, etc. Sure at some point you can make it work... Just limit yourself enough in a sandbox game and tell everyone that this game works just fine. And if not, tell everyone it's an alpha game that excuses all the design&management failures that this game company made.\nJust look at the memory leaks alone... It's enormous. But hey, if you don't see any bugs, if you don't see the epic failures from their management and if you are not worried that this game is unlikely to ever reach the finish line, then this game is for you!\nIt's your PC!... I have no words for this level of 'stupidity'... Maybe my RAM has a hole in it... Me and other admins literally see the memory leaks on the servers. But it must be my client PC that somehow leaks memory because my CPU is bad right? And what about all the bugs? Also caused by my 'bad CPU'?\nAnd when I look at the server I sometimes see that the CPU runs at like 1-40% capacity and 30GB free RAM left and a good ping and free disk space and etc. But still we got a slideshow caused server-side? Maybe... just maybe.... it's the game? Just at least consider it?\n\nBut it's alpha.. How can you downvote anything in alpha?(quote is not mine)You post a review on the state of the game. Not the state you think the game will be in. I think it's fair people are made aware of the limitations of the current game. Especially those wanting to play MP.","December 27, 2015","false","203.5"," 154 of 266 people (58%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","58","154","266","12","32"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/realeternal/recommended/244850/","realeternal","ELi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/realeternal/","220 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nShort "review": Wait a year and see if this game is (still) in active developement. In it's current state it's more of a tech demo with a lot of performance issues. But it can be a great game in the future for sandbox and survival game lovers.\n\nGood things\n+ Looks good.\n+ Fun to design and build ships, station and cars.\n+ Cool with Star Systems, especially in Survival mode.\n+ Got battle mechanics for those interested (can be turned off).\n+ Pretty good damage and physics modeling - stations, ground and vehicles can break in a neat way.\n+ It's like Minecraft with mods with better graphics but a more shallow tech tree (you can get the coolest stuff in a matter of hours in survival).\n+ Lots of potential, can be a really great game.\n+ Strong modding community, you can find a lot of good mods in the Steam Workshop.\n+ Lot's of options on how to play the game. For example, do you want to start on the moon? Or in the outer space with only a crappy ship?\n\nThe not so good things\n- Crashes, freezing your computer. According to the devs they have problem with AMD beta GPU drivers, AND Nvidia drivers. So what should we use? An old Matrox GPU? Anyways, sometimes you can play for 2h without a complete freeze, sometimes you can play 20 minutes, sometimes you get away with "only" restarting the game. But be prepared to reboot your computer. I have tried different drivers and settings, and the game crash (most often also freezing the computer) sooner or later. So saving and fully restarting the game every 45 minutes is a work around.\n- Performance - This game is pretty taxing on your computer and the game has a sluggish feeling to it (even with 120 FPS).\nAnd when fun stuff are happening (like destruction of ships/ground) it will get pretty nasty on the frame rate and general flow/speed (often called simulation speed in this game). So if you want to build a massive space station or planet base, be prepared for a single digit FPS and/or playing in slow motion.\n- Save game corruption. You start up a new game in Survival, you decide to start on "Earth" in a Star System with Mars, the Moon and a Alien planet. After let's say 12h when you want to explore the star system you notice that the other planets are gone. You verify this with a save game editor. The moon is gone, Mars is gone, it's only "Earth" left. So save games can be corrupted (happened to me at least twice now). You can manually edit new planets in, but that's not the same and they will probably dissapear too.\n- Progression: If you want the game for a strong Survival experience like in Minecraft (with mods), forget it - you wont find it here. There is no real progression other than mining, no tech tree, nothing to discover since all resources can be found everywhere (besides platinum that can't be found on "Earth"). This means that there is practically no reason to explore or play this like an adventure, you have everything you need where you start (or at least in 1-2h of play time).\n- Developement cycle. At this rate I wonder if the game ever will be finished. There are weekly updates that bring new cool stuff. I would prefer if they focused on performance and stability before adding all the "fun" stuff. I know it's fun to add graphical updates and stuff like that. And bug fixing is a boring job. But sooner or later you (the devs) have to do the boring stuff too.\n\n\nSo, yeah. This game is in early access, developed by a small studio in a slow pace. It got huge potential and besides save game corruption and all the crashes I had fun with it. You should probably wait for your own sake, or get it now on a sale and play it when (or if) it ever get completed. Thumbs down for now but I will be back and hopefully be able to recommend this game.","April 26","false","78.7"," 33 of 50 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","33","50","0","3"

It was not without hesitation that I bought this game, and that was even at a 50% sale. Well, after the three first days I had amassed an impressive ~30 hours of playtime simply because I couldn't stop playing!\n\nIt should be said that I have not put much time at all into the Survival mode, I've almost exclusively been playing Creative mode. If you even consider buying this game I advise you to check Youtube for gameplay videos - there are lots of channels that give you a good perspective on what this game is, and what you can do within it.\n\nWell, on to some pros and cons!\n\nPros:\n+ Vanilla game offers wonderfull possibilities when it comes to construct your ships and bases.\n+ The modding community is outstanding and expands vastly on the vanilla game.\n+ The Dev-team seems to update the game in regular intervals. (They even released a major one on X-mas day!)\n+ In my opinion fairly cheap for what you get.\n+ Out of ideas for what to build? Youtube is full of incredible channels that feature user created content from Space Engineers that continue to inspire for a long time.\n+ The ability to save your designs and "paste" them into new world. This is togglable when you create a new world.\n+ Easy to get started with and a world of more complex constructs awaits you if you dive deeper into the game.\n\nCons:\n- The maximum travel speed ingame might feel pretty slow if you are playing on a large world with long distances to cover.\n- Game is still in a pretty early development stage, so bugs and glitches are bound to be around for a while.\n- Public multiplayer can seem infested by griefers unless you are playing with people you know or trust.\n- Easy to spend way too many hours playing, forgetting other stuff like sleeping or eating...\n\nTo conclude this review, I would like to say that I most heartily recommend this game to anyone who wants to let loose their creative side when building awesome stuff in space.\n\nJust my few cents!\n/Trobbel","December 27, 2014","true","761.2"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","88","14","16","5","0"

When my friends are off doing their thing in games I don't have, I'm usually in this. I'm only just scratching the surface of potential, too. Creative if insanely fun, and Survival is harshly challenging. If you want more challenge in either mode, the recent addition of Meteor storms has seriously kicked things up a notch. If you feel the need you can change your world settings from Survival to Creative, you can change the frequency of Meteor showers, and adjust the realism of Survival if you're having a hard time with the masochistic default survival settings.\n\nNot a true Sandbox game yet, but I imagine that is a possibility in the future. The plyable objects and terrain is also fun, you can drill into things, blow it apart with rockets, or stockpile warheads and set it all on fire!\n\nI left out that I found the Music rather fitting and epic, but to summarize the rest: Buy this game if you like building things and space ships. It's still in-dev so there's definitely more to come!\n\n-Addendum 10/10/2014 GET THIS WHILE IT'S ON SALE!

Also, I noticed a ton of childish reviews that really have not been helpful at all, I hope to fix this.\n\nA decent building sim, but if you are looking for anything other than a simple building sim with literally nothing else to do other than mining for ore, and building structures/ships then don't buy this. Once you build all your ships and structures, there is really nothing to use these creations for. The game gets extremely tedious and the optimization is not absolutely great. The game requires a pretty powerful pc in order to get satisfactory gameplay online. I personally have not played single player, so I do not know how that is. I realize this is still early access but in comparison to some other early access titles, this one is virtually unplayable if you are anything like me, and don't own a great graphics card or powerful processor. I can run any of the games in my library no problem at medium - high settings, but not this game.\n\nAs you can see, I have put many hours into this game so it IS fun, but that is based solely on the idea that you think there just HAS to be more to the game, or more is coming and once you reach the point I have, of realizing what the game truly consists of, you are left thinking how pointless it is to play. The updates are frequent, usually every Thursday but in the year I have owned it, not too much has been changed in terms of giving us some actual substance. There is literally nothing to do other than mine, and craft. You can try to have big epic space battles with your friends, but unfortunately combat scenarios are very laggy and not only that, if you are playing in survival, you don't really want to destroy your creations so quickly. I would personally love to be able to USE my creations for something other than mining or capturing an empty stray ship for more ore. All in all, this game has potential, but in it's current state, unless you want a simple building sim with not much else to focus on, this one is NOT for you. If you want a true online experience I suggest waiting till they add more content.\n\n\nCONS:\n\n-  The optimization is not GREAT. The game requires a pretty powerful rig to get the most out of the experience.\n\n- Lack of things to do. All there is to do, is build and mine for ore/collect resources. Gets very tedious and repetitive, extremely quickly.\n\n- No player progression whatsoever. (This is more of a personal con as I feel this would improve the overall game, but to each his/her own.)\n\n- Should be $10 considering it's current unfinished state.\n\nPROS:\n\n- Great concept\n\n- Beautiful atmosphere\n\n- An abundance of things to craft with and create.\n\n- Multiplayer (Would be cooler, if there was some sort of common goal, or struggle. Something to create strife, as there is nothing to really do.)\n\n- Extremely frequent updates, and devs who seem to care.\n\nAll in all, it's a game with lots of potential but it is very tedious and boring in it's current state. I would suggest waiting, unless you want something to literally just build ships that you can't really use for anything other than taking screenshots and showing them off.","August 11, 2014","false","127.8"," 212 of 376 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","212","376","2","25"

It was off to a rocky start but then the devs started pumping iron and breathed life into the empty void. It started to pick up traction shortly after but that was nothing compaired to the shipments of updates that started flying by. I'm really impressed by how clear the devs vision of what they want the game to be is, its astronomical. Communication has always been a focus of the devs when constructing the backbone of the game: its community. Shortly after I started playing this game the community exploded due to all the direct comms between the community and the devs. I still can't beleive how un-survivable the ordeal started out as only to become the most airtight experience I've had on steam. They've really refined the game into a masterpeice and merged the collective ideas of the community with the pressurized determination of the most productive, effective, and efficient development team I've ever discovered in my adventures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are you looking for?

Possibly discovering other planets\n-Space pirates\n\nPros:\n-Fun and addicting survival mode\n-Even if you're more interested in survival mode, creative is still useful for making prototypes and blueprints\n-Multiplayer is extremely easy to set up\n-Game gets prepetually updated with new features and bug fixes\n-Active workshop community creating new blocks, vehicles, scripts etc.\n-Lots of potential playtime\n-Good tutorials\n-Blocks are NOT locked to a universal grid\n\nCons:\n-Game can be confusing at first. Reccomend checking out some "Getting Started" guides before jumping in\n-Building good vehicles is hard and an improperly built vehicle can be the loss of alot of resources. If you're new, test them in creative first\n-The games physics don't always play nice. Especially in multiplayer. This is a problem the devs are actively working on though.\n-Can be demanding for weaker machines. Once again, the devs are doing their best to get rid of this.\n-Rather buggy\n-Gets stale without friends. Make sure you have a friend to play with before buying. The multiplayer is a major focus\n\nOverall. Space Engineers is a really addicting game for those who are willing to put the time needed into it. It takes a few hours of building before you get your first viable vehicle but once you get past that initial difficulty curve, things will go alot smoother and you'll be pushing out amazing creations in no time. And even if you don't like designing vehicles and bases there's an entire workshop full of blueprints which you can import to the game.\n\nThis game get an 8/10 for bringing a rather unique twist to the survival building genre and keeping it very fun for a very long time despite being full of glitches.","April 11","true","176.5"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","13","15","0","0"

And the planets, while awe-inspiring, are only that way ‘til you ‘land’ on them.\n\nMy deaths have been many and glitchy...and since this game doesn't keep items on either death or relog, they can be detrimental if you were trying to build something and had items in hand.  Oh, let me say that last bit again, just to be clear: on relog, if you have items in hand, they are GONE.  So I hope you put your stuff away, 'cause what you had is poof!  But I digress...let's actually look at my experiences!\n\nMy last deaths are as follows:\n- Walked into a tunnel, touched a pebble.  Fell through the earth to my doom.\n- Walked up to an AI ship that crashed into the surface, jittering wildly...got touched by it, almost died from the contact (okay, not technically a death, but close).\n- Used a jetpack to fly up to a mountain top, couldn’t slow down, crashed.\n- Same, but tried landing on smooth surface.\n- Walked across the ice.  That’s it.  Was walking across the ice.  The flattest, most benign surface you could imagine.  Tripped on NOTHING and died.\n- Reloaded server, couldn’t move on spawn...slowly suffocate to death.  REPEATEDLY.\n\nThis is not to account for the multiple times I ended up somehow falling into the center of the planet from touching a pebble...those don’t count as deaths because I’d have to teleport up to a fellow player (I count one because I didn’t have the ability to TP for that one...used backspace).  Just about any physics object can easily become a glitchy mess...I saw breakdancing vehicles, floating body bags and playing kickball with a ship...before suffocating inside where the ship ACTUALLY was.  Oh, and don't try actually digging down into the earth...you know, where everything is, because trying to point DOWN and hitting the rock with your actual drill is near impossible!  And this is supposedly the EASIEST way to mine right now.  This is all very recent, and after a week of ‘fixes’ for planets.\n\nAnd about those planets...I foresee further issues once it’s realized that the planets have indestructible trees, no fluids (water is ice atm), no caves, and a surface devoid of life.  Each one of these things getting eventually added (as I’m sure the populace will demand them) will each in turn break the game yet again.\n\nPLAY EARLY ACCESS AT YOUR OWN RISK.\n\nIf and when this game leaves Early Access, I will retry it to see if it is playable, but I assure you...I will NOT be touching this game until that label is removed.\n","November 28, 2015","false","56.7"," 46 of 77 people (60%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","60","46","77","17","10"

I hope someday I can change this review to positive but honestly its been\nyears now and perhaps there have been a few optimizations but it is /still/ a bloody\nmess.\n\nLet me start by saying I recently re-downloaded this game, after giving up on it because\nrather than optimize the game KSH just decided to raise the minimum system requirements\nand I did not meet them. Prior to this I was eagerly awaiting the upcoming optimization,\nplanets, and new multiplayer back end update. All while suffering through the terribly low\nfps and sim speed.\n\nI was really enjoying myself on one of the preset earth-like worlds untill it got so slow that\nit became a pain to even play(can we say memory leaks boys and girls? :D)\n\nI've now uninstalled it and given up on it a second time.\n\nI have heard KSH and their legion of fans preach "Premature optimization is the root of\nall evil." as an excuse for KSH to not optimize their code untill beta. Well let me just\nremind them that the /full/ quote is actually:\n\nWe should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time; premature optimization\nis the root of all evil\n\n~Donald Knuth\n\nThis was born in a time when we still were working with asm. Small efficiencies here literally\nmeant techniques that would have obfusticated the code base or making various,\nper-cpu-model optimizations for a fractional speed boost. This does not mean make stupid\nand wasteful choices while coding. This does not mean ignore plainly obvious bottlenecks in\ncode (I am certain there must be a few with how bloody slow this game runs). This does not\nmean raise the minimum system requirements instead of optimizing the game.\n\nIt means write code intelligently, which is really not that hard to do if you are capable of\nwriting even basic programs (think basic utilities or really simple GUI without an IDE backing\nyou), but don't go nuts on refactoring or writing semi-obfusticated code just to reduce\nprocessing a small amount. It means attach a profiler, determine where the real hogs are,\nand address them instead.\n\nI acknowledge that beta is a time of bug fixing and optimization. But that is precisely the\ntime for optimization of the little things, which is exactly what Knuth was referencing.\nFixing the bugs and optimizing the systems is something that should be done the /entire/\ntime.\n\nAs I said, I have nothing but a few minor issues with the actual game itself (cyberdogs are\none of these issues for being so out of place and immersion breaking), but the VRage\nengine is a trashy mess currently and ruins the game for me and several others I know.\nI /really/ hope that I can actually run this game some day!\n\nThanks to whomever reads this, and best of luck to the devs :)","May 22","false","234.1"," 29 of 46 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","29","46","0","5"

With nearly 200 hours, I can say I fell into this game with a Minecraft level addiction. It's been sitting in my library unplayed for a while because the game seemed to lack any real goal, or formal challenge. This changed when they implemented planets.\n\nMy first and only real run at SE lasted pretty much the bulk of my playtime. Not having any real reason to play the game up until that point. But this go-round I instituted my own goal; I would crash on a planet in a starting ship, I'd get off planet and build an orbital base, from the base I'd build a ship that'd allow me to travel to another planet.\n\nNot a complicated goal, but it kept my interest in the game up. I had just gotten the step where I build my own ship, a mobile base it you may. By that time I had left my orbital base to explore. I had a half-build mothership, a mining ship, and a ship for landing planet-side.\n\nI decided to leave my base behind and explore since I now had functioning thrusters, and even better, a warp drive. However, as I moved around my mothership, I noticed some really strange things happening with my docked ships when I moved my mothership. While staying docked they'd still manage to shift in my hangar hull.\n\nWell that was kinda annoying. After nearly every jump and every ship repositioning (even after lowering my gyro power to 2%, as I thought that might be doing it) I had to go back to my hanger and re-dock my ships.\n\nAnyway, after hours and hours of work, I've given up on the game. Last night I left my ship saved right after a jump heading towards the moon. When I logged back in, I was dead, and my ship was hurling through space at about 42 m/s with no explanation. It was stopped when I saved last night. Sorta, I noticed more and more after I'd jump somewhere that my ship would 'drift' even after inertia dampening it back down to no thrust, it'd accelerate back up to 0.01 m/s.\n\nAfter having to respawn twice and do some quick jetpack work, I was able to get my ship stopped. My mining ship is gone, my lander is destroyed and my hangar has a huge hole in it. No explanation. Hours of work destroyed by a bug.\n\nLike any early access game, wait till it's released.\n\nUPDATE: 06/02/2016 Gave it a try again, spent a considerable amount of time building until eventually I had two unwarranted ice explosions. Containers full of ice in two ships spontaneously exploded. This game is still not ready for prime-time. I'd recommend steering clear of it.\n\nI'd suggest not buying it at all. I doubt it will ever be fixed.\n\nI doubt I'll be trying it again. I was also greatly looking forward to Medieval Engineers, I can say with all certainty that I will be passing on it completely. From the mostly negative reviews it's currently getting, I guess it's not a huge surprise.","January 3","false","229.2"," 36 of 59 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","36","59","0","2"

Now, replace the pixelated visual style with crisp graphics that rival Bioware titles. Good, now replace the medieval fantasy setting with the depths of space. Then, add the physical properties associated with space, and a building mechanic that not only lets you build architecture, but also space craft ranging in size from small fighters to gargantuan carrier vessels. Add blocks of various shapes and components for complicated mechanisms such as motors and gravity generators. Let's also throw in a destruction engine that lets every block deform with stress and damage in the most realistic manner conceivable.

The first hour I spend not understanding what to do at all! As the super tech guy I am ( I thought ) .. This was no prob to play. .. untill I actually started it.\nBack on the tutorials to get the basic, then on youtube to watch some tips and tricks, and now ... now the game is just awsome.\n\nI'm trying out new ways to build ships, trying my best to make copies of ships like X-Wing, Serenity and more.\nBuilding a space station, and just make it bigger .. more complex way to utilize the station .. just to see where it takes me .. I love every aspect of it.\n\nIt does have bugs .. all games do .. This is an Early Alpha .. remember this.\nThe bugs that are in Creative mode is  more as small hickups .. the funny glitch when you mine something, and suddenly you see through the whole asteriode for a second, then return to the mining again .. can be weird, fun and annoying .. all at once :D\nIn survival mode I've had one bigger issue .. and it was that my miningship sometimes just broke during flight .. or lost a container or reactor .. once I lost 5 thrusters ... but ... even as annoying this is, I recommend NOT using the autosave .. but rather save at your own so you can get back and redo if you crash or loose something due to a glitch.\n\nI have only a few hours in multiplayer, so I will not comment much regarding this. The little I've played have been flawless. I would believe that some of the survival mode glitches might appear in MP survival aswell..\n\nPros:\nTotal freedom in what you want to build, where to go, what to do.\nGrahpics are pretty good. Lots and lots better than minecraft.. ( I know .. stop comparing it lol )\nLots and lots of mods to play around with.\nYou can have a singleplayer survival or creative mode save, and turn it into a LAN/MP world if wanted.\nDevs are doing weekly updates, from new items/armor and more, to bugfixes and optmizing.\n\nCons:\nYou get thrown into space, not much help there. ( unless you watch tutorials and youtube )\nGlitches and bugs, but this is a part for ALL games...\nUnless you KNOW what an item does, there's no helpscreen about the item. ( example: you have rotor, but unless you know what to do, you won't get it to work right... )\n\nBut!!! All in all. .. I'm very happy I got this game gifted to me. So far I have enjoyed my 50 hours into the game, an I know I will enjoy atleast the next 100 hours.

Space engineers is a sandbox style game in which you are placed in space and can build to your hearts content.  It shares the same genre as minecraft being a sandbox but is not Minecraft.  Think of it this way, Battlefield is a first person shooter but is in no way the same as Counter Strike.  Sure, each has similarities in that you are in first person mode with a firearm, but beyond that, the mechanics are very different.\nSpace Engineers takes on this same style.  It seperates itself apart from the rest in that it is in space, is not completely block based, and has a modern/futuristic feel to it that takes some getting used to.  Building is easy in this game, there are many different types of items but the foundation is always a block, slope, inverted corner, triangle, or a landing gear for a ship.  You can make stations, ships, capital ships (larger ships essentially), opening and closing doors, hidden turrets behind a set of lights, etc.  The possibilites are endless and the weekly updates make it even better.\nUranium is your life force and your refinery and assembler are your tools.  Without these three things nothing happens and you end up respawning inside a yellow ship with these basic things and nothing else.  Turning things off like a gravity generator and the engines may be necessary at first just to preserve what little uranium you do have.  Do not fret however, almost all materials needed are not difficult to find...for the most part.  Some places you might find entire sections of uranium while other areas may contain traces of the ore but also have spots of other ore like gold, magnesium, silicon, nickel, iron, and silver.  Each has their uses of course.\nBugs are apparent in some instances of the game.  It is an alpha so it will have issues but as said before, weekly updates are releasing new content and fixing old content that may not work properly.  Dedicated servers are an option or you can just run it from your local machine as you see fit.  The dedicated server that I run is locked down to my group only and consumes very little resources.  In fact, my machine is running a mumble server, a minecraft server, and Space Engineers and the machine is an old AMD Atlhlon x3 x64 system with 4 GB of RAM on windows 7.  So anyone can run a server!\nPerformance wise, the game engine has a bit of optimization needed.  Sometimes it lags other times it is fine.  I run a very clean system that is top notch performance with dual SSDs in RAID 0 and 16 GB of RAM with dual video cards and a high end processor and still experience issues from time to time.  Nothing serious, but still, they are there.\nOverall, the atmosphere of the game is great.  The sound effects, music, graphics, everything is great.  The controls are a bit wonky at first but you get used to them.  You can just remap controls if you really get irritated though, so keep that in mind as an option.  Creative mode and Survival are a blast although the latter is my favorite.  Playing with friends is fun and hunting down those armed mining ships and military ships is a blast.  Physics play a role, so that means mass is also important and how many thrusters you have overall will make a difference.  Everything from reactors to guns and stations to capital ships are present in this game.  Nothing here is poorly executed aside from the menu system which can take some getting used to.  At this point on the timeline, I would say this is a good buy for those looking to play something unfinished but worth their time.","June 24, 2014","true","121.3"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

(This was all I could come up with back in Nov 2013, only a month after game release)\n\nNow its nearly May 2016 and I have got over 5200hours playing this game, I still think its awesome.\n\nIn the last 2 years or so this game has come a long way from what I remember it was like not long after release. We now have planets to visit and build on as well as a world that is 1Billion K's across to explore. Although, much of it is empty space with asteroids throughout, each and every world can be customised to suit your gaming wishes. There is 100,000's of mods available on the workshop that you can use to make your game experience how you would like it. If you enjoy Star Trek for example, there is many Star Trek themed mods that you could have in your world so you could build the Enterprise or maybe a Klingon Bird of Prey. There is over 200 planets that have been created by the modding community that you could populate your world with.\n\nThe choices of gamemodes suit many different players, Single Player Creative mode where you can build whatever you wish without the need for resources. This is a great mode for designing and building ships or stations for blueprint creation for use in other worlds and also learning about all the functions of the many choices of in-game blocks. Single Player Survival, with this gamemode you can challenge yoursef to find the resources you need to build your hopes and dreams. There are several scenarios to choose from, each with differing setups to start a game, for example the Easy Start Scenarios give you a station on a planet with 3 basic ships to get you started in the game. in the setup for each game you can customise the setup to make it however challenging you want. From inventory size, crafting speeds to settings like pirate drones and even cyberhounds and alien spiders which will attack you or start chewing through blocks on your base to get to you.\n\nThen there is multiplayer, you can host your single player game on your own machine to invite friends to join in, or there is many dedicated servers to choose from. I have been running a dedicated server myself for over 2 years now (spaceengineers.com.au). Now, I will be honest and say the multiplayer Netcode is still a WIP and at times, issues in game will frustrate you to no end. Don't let this put a dampner on how you feel about the game, the developers have stuck to their weekly update schedule and slowly but surely everything is getting better. As with all Alpha development games, some patches can end up breaking the game for some, but be patient as the team will surely have the issues patched up soon.\n\nOverall, I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys building, using and showing off their creations. There is a plethora of player creations on the workshop, including blueprints that other players have created that you can build in game. You are only limited in this game by your own imagination. Search for Space Engineers on youtube too, if this review hasn't been enough to convince you, i'm sure some of the fantastic videos of player creations, machinima and the like would be enough to push you over the edge and make you want to buy it.\n\nHope to see you in game one day, and if you found this review helpful please give it a thumbs up.","November 21, 2013","true","256.5"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","2"

I bought space engineers a long LONG time ago but never had the ability to play it due to potato PC's. A little later I got a new HP Envy, still was a potoato to run this game. So still was never able to play it. Ever since planets came out made me feel left out because of my PC. I still never touched the game though. After a recent update I decided to give it a try and see what I can get out of it, well since they added the option to turn off shadows really helped! I ran the game on the lowest settings possible, lowered the resolution to the minimum that looked best, not enough to mishape things, still even with the screen. and well I was able to play away!\n\nI managed to get a fast smooth framerate with a Intel HD 4600 GPU!! I would build cool things after I did the tutorial, and would build from little rovers to space stations! I would ask my sister who was very addicted to minecraft: "Can you do this in minecraft?!" maybe with all the redstone stuff but would be very bulky.\n\nI don't know why people complain about running this game on beast PC's on low settings and would only get around 10 to 5 fps. I managed to get this game running nice and smooth on a potato! (this is all including planets)\n\nNow people do say that this game is minecraft in space. Well that is accurate. Building is similar to minecraft, but more complex. Minecraft is everything blocks. Blocky world too. Space engineers has blocks to smooth out your creations to make them NOT so blocky. The planets are more planet-ish also!\n\nThis game has a high learning curve too. Which I'm sure people don't like, but I do! I like to learn how to play complex games like this. Feels really fun and challenging at the same time! After you build some pretty rad things in this game. You'll never complain about your house being griefed on minecraft agiain! :)\n\nThe only thing I don't like about this game is that there is not too much to do here. Besides building ships and bases and well stuff like that. Thats why I set my own objectives to reach a certain planet or moon.\n\nI also hear that multiplayer is really buggy. Well I can't say anything about that because I'm more of a anti-social person, so I NEVER play multiplayer. (Unless with a friend)\n\nI also never seemed to encounter much bugs with this game also. (In singleplayer of course) The only bug I have encountered is the gamma or contrast messing up when the game auto saves. (The screen would be really bright or really dark)\n\nNow all I have to say is if you buy this game after reading my review. Keep your expectations low. This is just my expirience with this game and I can't guarentee anything to anyone else.\n\nThanks for reading this rambling review! It may not prove usefull but It will get my word out!\nThanks again! :)","April 14","true","93.2"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","0"

Just buy it already! Multiplayer is fun, building is a dream with control interfaces that most games wish they had.\n\nThe sheer number of items, blocks and designs you can create is staggering! It also has a very nice XYZ mirroring features, copy and paste - real-time of ships and objects. Offensive weapons! Such detailed and rich environment and object / ship damage.\n\nBuild big, build small, build a station to house them all! Gravity, Mass, Velocity, etc all apply here and it makes for some great physics fun! With gravity generators, you can make any direction and adjustable field sizing for direct gravity on objects and players. Lighting / shaders are top notch, and the effects you can experience are background / image potential for sure.\n\nIt is well worth the money for this, and if you ever want to build together - just shoot me a message!\n\n*This game has only gotten 10x better since my review back in Febuary - customization and amount of addons and changes is too numerous to begin to tell you - the videos on the Store page don't do justice - they are mostly old. Just look up the weekly dev blog that in-depth explains the newest features and keys to get a better feel at current state. The MP is solid and full on space battles are just about seamless.\n\nWonderful are the latest changes to make ships and stations interchangable with docking ports, and now conveyor systems for item transfers, passenger seating, color scheme on everything is RGB / Hue / Sat customized, Turrets both interior and exterior, artificial mass blocks and gravity generator modifications. I could go on and on, or you could just check out their weekly videos since release. The real-time damage system is SOOO great, and detailed.\n\nThere is something for everyone - whether you are into pitting two dogfighters at each other and record it, hundred people in your own spaceport RP system, or simply want to solo design an epic space station in the side of an asteroid you blew a chunk out of.\n\nIF YOU ARE ON THE FENCE AT ALL ABOUT THIS GAME, BUY IT!

This game doesn't come without its early game problems though, which i have serveral ideas.\n\n1. You can't build road vehicles (disregard, it has been pointed out to me that artificial mass gives gravity to road vehicles)\nThough you have wheels and suspension, you can't really build a small vehicles because they end up floating away, not that you need small road vehicles considering the concept of the game, but the wheels should be pulled down by gravity like the player is, otherwise, like i said before, it'll float away, i'm not sure why wheels exist in this game as of now, but adding gravity affect to wheels, and steering assemblies wouldn't hurt, it would really be as much usefull as much as it would be novelty, unless you have a REALLY large ship, which is what i'm working on, there will be a core of the ship because you'll need a vehicle to get to and from really fast.\n\n2. Server lag.\nI feel that the multiplayer servers and the way everything is handled when sharing maps could be done more efficiently, so much lag and is very network intensive, i work with networking and computers and the way everything network in this game is being handled, is not doing so very efficiently, i'd have people join my maps, complain about the extreme lag, and leave, like clockwork.\n\n3. Some of the cubes are limited.\nFor example, on large ships you can only place large cubes, and for small ships, you can only place small cubes.  When you are configuring your toolbar, there is a category for large cubes, and a category for small cubes, they aren't really large or small, the size of your cube is completely dependent on the type of ship you're building, so the "small cube" "large cube" categories are somewhat confusing, i think it could have been thought out a little better.  Another note on the cubes are the passage way cubes, i forget exactly what they're called, but there are only strait peices, no T or L or + peices, so you kind of have to figure a sollution to make that cube work.\n\nThere are a few little things that bug me, but not enough to state them here, and yes, i am aware it is still an early access game, the 3 ones that i posted above were problems to me that i felt needed to be pointed out, overall, the game is super awesome and i would recommend this game 3 times over plus another time, definitely the best $20 i've ever spent thus far.  Another thing i'd like to note is that it's also not as processor intensive i though it would be, as of now (12-11-2014), i have a pentium G630 on an asus p8h77-v and 3.5gigs of ram (32 bit OS) and a geforce 9800gt.  The graphics card does become quite the convection oven though during gameplay it goes up to around 210 - 220 farhenheit, and that fan gets LOUD, if i didn't have the cooling i did, it would probably already be dead, it's minorly concerning, i have a second 9800gt that i might put into an sli but with only a 430psu, it would concern me.","December 11, 2014","true","304.7"," 21 of 33 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","21","33","0","7"

THE best early access game i have ever bought. The developers listen to feedback from players e.g. Solar Panels and then later on Rechargable battery packs. It's easiest to describe this game as "Minecraft in space" but that doesnt cover it. Minecraft is about setting up a sustainable base and then eventually defeating the Ender-Dragon or in creative mode seeing what you can build using cubes of various materials. Space Engineers is about seeing what you can create using nothing but the resources dug and refined from nearby asteroids, making them into various parts for assembly and then constructing anything from makeshift cars to fighter ships all the way up to an Eldar Craftworld (although that will lag a LOT its Early access.. c'mon what would you expect?) The only limit in Space Engineers is your imagination. With an active community that uploads items onto the workshop on a daily basis you can never run out of inspiration or other ships to test your latest deadly weapon or attack vessle against. Apart from the occasional lag issues when your world starts to fill up with failed experiments/enormous ships/enormous space station/ thousands of your corpses cause you failed to recharge your suit in time, this genuinely feels like a finished product. Except it isn't. With updates coming every week on a Thursday with simple things like Bug fixes or (more often than not) completely new content this is an enjoyable, constantly in motion game for all the family... Well maybe not, I wouldn't invite little Cousin Jimmy into your world for him to then fly around blowing your beautiful constructs up because he figured out how to make warheads and "The boom noise is too funny!" Damnit Jimmy... Anyway at £14.99 its difficult to say no to this game.

Those that need structure and plot to guide you through a game this game wont be for you,  it is truely open free-form gameplay.  anyone who loves sandbox play however will get lots of enjoyment out of this im betting.\n\nThere are limitations on this game like any alpha stage early access game.  Im going to try and cover some of the pros and cons of this game in its current state.\n\nThe Cons:: Audio issues,  multiplayer sync issues but still very playable,  a lack of direction or set goals can be frustrating to some,  no obvious "enemy"  to work against/attack/defend against, not optimized graphically yet,  game breaking bugs do exist but none that cant be worked around ussually.  You can expect a distinct lack of "polish" being an alpha so just make sure you look at it in the view that this game is /not/ finished so keep that in mind when a frustrating issue pops up.\n\nThe Pros:: Price! (14.99),  FREQUENT updates (every thursday it recieves content updates with new fixes,  blocks,  game mechanics), very active community modding support via workshop,  multiplayer host shares mods with anyone joining so people without your mods can still come and go easily.  Survival and Creative modes are distinct and each offer their own entertainment values offering freebuilding or resource gathering and piracy of npc ships, support for pvp via factions and ownership privileges that allows you to form a team of other players to fight with/against, intuitive controls,  nearly limitless building options! If you can dream it you can build it in this game..  from a giant carrier to little mining pods,  stations to sprawling solar farms.\n\nThe pros outweight the cons i promise,  this game is very highly recomended to anyone who loves sandbox building,  or playing with legos lol.","September 6, 2014","true","618.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","1"

The game doesn't come together in the way that it should. Animations are clunky, optimization and perfmormance are pretty bad, glitches are very common, and the game structure itself isn't anywhere near user-friendly.\n\nThis game cannot be defended by claiming that it's early access. The devs have had plenty of time to polish the weaker aspects of the game, yet seem to lack the insight or skill to address and solve these issues. Instead, their ambition as game developers pushes them to mash in more half-functioning or barely relevant content, which often overcomplicates the game and adds numerous bugs.\n\nKeen Software House has bit off more than they can chew, and it shows when they try to conquer something like planets and AI. The "monsters" are of absolute amateur quality, the planet rendering is atrocious, and everything comes off as awkward. The world design is horrific, in my opinion. The aesthetics of the planets are very out of place, not to mention the overbearing lack of purpose. The game suffers from what many open world games like this do, and that is the extreme lack of feeling like there's anything the player actually -has- to do.\n\nTL;DR The game feels empty. It's nice for the first few hours, but the dark underbelly of Space Engineers reveals that it is simply a hollow, awkwardly assembled shell of an amazing idea.

The game seems to be a much less bug-ridden experience if you play solo and perhaps in a creative mode, but networked and survival gameplay is very much unpolished.\n\nI've owned this game for years now and i've played it at multiple stages during it's development, which makes me feel like i have a decent grasp on it's issues with it's rate of development and bugfixing, which motivated me to write this review.\n\nI had a lot of fun with this game. I've played it for near 100 hours. After KSP it's probably the best space sandbox game.\nBut despite all of it's potential i can't really recommend the game, especially as a person who likes multiplayer and playing with friends.\n\nI've always thought that this game was great, but after having it for years i'm not seeing much improvement in terms of bugfixing and networking optimization.\nIf you want to buy this game, even despite all the bugs, in hopes that the developers will fix it.. I'm saying, don't do it. There is no guarantee that they'll fix anything, since they haven't really fixed any of the core networking issues since i first played the game. Everything is still jumpy, permanently desyncing, crahsing, etc.\n\nThe game is ridden with bugs that can break your server unless you clean it up occasionally.\nIt's also full of bugs that have you or your buddies constantly restarting the game.\nMost of the game's issues are networking-related, for example clients not receiving the same information, even at <100 ping, which spirals out of control for some reason, ending at a point where clients may not see interactions of some objects at all, or they see everything 10km away from where it really is. These are really common occurences.\nThe conveyor system is full of bugs as well, sometimes pulling items in and out of inventories where items shouldn't even be allowed to flow due to the system not being in a loop, just a one way linear set of sorters, cargo boxes and assemblers.\n\nEven though the maximum speed in the game is limited to a grueling 100m/s, supposedly in order to prevent the physics from breaking, it still constantly breaks, while making travel to other planets a journey that takes HOURS unless you mine for just as long of a time for resources to make and use a jumpdrive.\n\nStarting scenarios are kind of a mess as well, there is no option to just start in a star system with asteroids and limited resources, essentially allowing you to play a survival mode where you can't spawn in new ships. There are some scenarios but they may not include some other generated features of the game. So you either modify server settings on the fly, or tweak your world with the editor in order to have a non-creative, survival experience with all the generated feautres (planets/moons/asteroids) of the game.\nIf you are completely new to the game you may miss out on these features entirely if you just start one of the scenarios that seem good.\n\nI have the most stable computer i've ever had, reaching 10 weeks of uptimes regularily while playing games and using various heavy applicatios.\nI don't think any game has ever crashed my system consistently since i've built my rig 2-3 years ago, yet space engineers manages to do it 2 times in an hour.\n\nSo, in closing... People who have played DayZ can understand a situation like this, where the game can be SO FUN yet so RIDDLED with bugs even after years of development, which is what makes this game really hard to recommend, because i DO want to play games with friends.\nThe DayZ developers worked with a proprietary engine that is very much known to be bug-ridden.\nI'm not sure what the excuse of Keen Software House is, as they've been working this engine engine from the ground up, starting with their previous games.\nNow they're also working on a game called medieval engineers...?\nWhy?","May 20","false","92.0"," 25 of 41 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","25","41","0","2"

As it stands now, especially with the latest patch that introduces drones and pirate bases, I can't recommend the game enough for anyone interested in 1) space 2) designing spaceships/bases with intricate details 3) survival. I've been gaming for decades and can't think of another game that made me feel so proud of my creations. The first time I designed a capable mining ship, with conveyors, spotlights, connectors, etc., and the damn thing actually WORKED as intended, well, I just had to pop open a cold one and pat myself on the back :) I've moved on to designing a capital ship now and relish the design challenges involved, such as maximizing Internal space while keeping weight manageable and finding a good protection/speed balance. So many challenges... It really gives you the feeling of being an actual engineer without the pesky 4-years-in-university part.\n\nIn addition to the basic game, many of the mods available through the workshop are true works of art, and easily double the number of blocks available. The introduction of AI enemies is still in its infancy but already promises to become something special, especially given KSH's investment in developing AI. The only thing I really miss at this point is the fact that my Oculus DK2 is not fully supported (can be played with VorpX but it kinda sucks).\n\nYes, there are some bugs (notably sometimes a slowdown in framerates when you mine)but, overall, I can say that I'm happy I paid full price for this game.

As of this writing, that was 1 1/2 years ago.  The game is so bugged now that I cannot even stomach launching it any more.  Let me explain..\n\nI have a deep love for the concept and great hope that KSH can pull this game together.  When I first purchased it, I played solo survival for a month and had a blast.  I then moved on to survival multiplayer PvP and had some of the most thrilling fulfilling gameplay of any game ever.  I made a dozen new friends, had factions and teams.. what a truly wonderful time.\n\nBut as time progressed, the Thursday patches became less of a anticipated feature gift and more of plea not to kill the game with crushing bugs.  After 6 months of almost completely killing the multiplayer community, the remaing few of us left in abject sorrow.  We could no longer play the game we loved so much.\n\n2015 came and went with dozens upon dozens of new features.  Great for the solo creative crowd, and kudos to KSH for keeping such a brisk pace.  But as 2015 closes, multiplayer is still unplayable.  The few server owners cry on the KSH forum for help just keeping their servers from crashing after 30 minutes.  A whole year and zero progress on MP.\n\nI will absolutely return to this game if KSH ever gets MP working.  Until then, it is in the "what could have been" category.\n\nAnd I will absolutely never ever purchase another Early Access game.  Developers have no incentive to ever finish the game, release it, and be accountable for its performance.","December 27, 2015","false","028.5"," 26 of 44 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","26","44","0","1"

For example: servers often crash, assets dissapear( jump drives delete ships after use), sim speed is slow because servers have to render more than is needed.  The game development appears to pander to users who play creative mode rather than multiplayer(eg planets instead of netcode).  I wouldn't recommend this game >edit<  to players who often play MP until it moves out of alpha stage or unless you're a die hard SE fan(like me).

You build ships, machines and space stations of of cubes and partial cubes (read: triangles); add doors and thrusters and cockpits and guns and all the other requirements of space travel, and then release your creation into the infinite void to go play astronaut (or cargo pilot, pirate, fighter pilot, deep-space miner... whatever tickles your fancy)\n\nNow, this is not exactly a casual game. Yes, you can just plonk in a few blocks and fly that construction until you crash into something; but the scope of SE is so much larger -- it really does focus on engineering. It's built around designing and problem-solving your way to success, be that completing a pre-made/Workshop mission, creating the greatest boarding ship you can imagine, or just amassing the material from mining an entire planet so you can refine it all for later use. There is a factions system, so you can have glorious space battles; and NPC enemies give plenty of possibilities if you'd rather blow things up than build them.\n\nFortunately, the game has workshop integration and the workshop is already filled with incredible builds; so you don't have to start from scratch every time. The game also features a creative mode where you can build without worrying about resources.\n\nIn summary then, this game is a game for creative people. It's a game for those who want to roleplay being an eastronaut (or space pirate, fleet commander, cargo hauler etc.), it's a game for people who like to blow things up, and it's a game for people who want to watch the spark of an idea turn into an armarda of heavily-armed spacefaring vessels. It's a game where you are able to get out what youput in, and a bit more - and because of that, I heartily reccomend it.","February 22, 2014","true","87.3"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","8","10","2","1"

Space Engineers hasn't changed. Still broken; pistons, wheels, power 'grid' still broken, etc. Hand mining after Empryion's much better system is incredibly bad in SE. Very very short interaction distance means lots of grief/frustration and due to still broken 'moveable bits' like wheels & pistons, trying to make a working mining truck is hopeless. NPC/PvE is -so- much better in Empryion! SE's idea of PvE on starting 'Earth' are jihadist exploding 'dogs' that would make Isis seem like a sweet old grandmother. Pointlessly OPed. Still have to "engineer -around- the game" not -with- the game. Some simple things that Empryion got right and SE devs seem too depressed to even consider; EGS uses Hovercraft instead of wheeled starter vehicles (hovers work great in EGS), Empryion has elevator blocks to get up & down (and they work when un-powered!) SE just has ramps. EGS starting survival is very nicely balanced with well done Hunger/Health/Oxygen systems, and NPCs -add- to immersion & are useful to boot.\nBottom line: I can easily recommend Empryion at full price but can't bring myself to recommend SE even at this weekends sale price of $7.49.\n\n--Original review--\nTo be fair there is a lot to like about Space Engineers.  But the 'engineering' part leaves an awful lot to be desired.\nThe game in general is 'box' based, similar to Minecraft, though natural parts aren't restricted to cubism & landscapes on moons & planets is very nice.  My main dislike is the lack of things like hinges, winches, cables, etc.  Basically the only moving blocks are a piston and a rotor.  Pistons have basically been broken since I bought the game in Feburary.\nOh, almost forgot wheels.  arrr, maybe I should have.  Wheels, well they'll just drive you nuts.  Especially in a gravity field like a world.  Their behaviour isn't even close to what you'd expect & never has been.  Which leaves me repeatedly trying to 'engineer' around the game, not -with- the game, and that's not only silly, but non-rewarding as well.  So I've learned to not use pistons or wheels, and only very carefully (and not on ships, only bases) to use rotors.\nThey're not cruising with the game, they've added many significant & large features since Feb, like oxygen, hydrogen and new thrusters for H, also Planets, some with cool alien spiders, and just today Cyberhounds to attack you on Earth (which, "you won't be able to turn off for a few days" a forced "Test this!" I'm not happy about).\nIt's their game & they decide what & when to implement; I get that.  It's Alpha, so not everything works & things will change.  Got it.  Reason for my thumbs down is I'm free to desire a real engineering challenge, which I don't get with the game as it is.  Yes, I've had some fun, but hours played on my profile don't reflect at the keyboard time.  You need to mine then refine ores to then make components, then put those together to make blocks.  Refining takes quite a while and at least half my 'played' hours were simply me leaving game running all night, refining.\nNow -design- challenges?  Sure.  There are enough different blocks to make some astonishing ships.  And they fly in space!  Just bear in mind that you can't make a simple hoist that will hook a cable to a crate and move it.  Yes, you can make a rigid arm, use a landing gear to magnetically lock onto a block and then move that, but any pistons you use are likely to explode on next game load if left under pressure.\nThere are many many mods for the game, someone even made a hinge that folks swear by.  But I only play vanilla, and that's what I'm reviewing.\n\nI really do hope that one day the game will have solid working movable bits like gears and jacks and cable hoists cause I really need an elevator to get 400m down to the valley floor from my hillside retreat.  As soon as they do (if I'm still around) I'll happily change to a thumbs up.","December 31, 2015","false","626.4"," 18 of 29 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","18","29","0","0"

Planets have an average diameter of 120 km.)\n* Build a fort and protect it against invading AI like pirates or sabiroids.\n* Enjoy the vistas of these different worlds\n* Settle down on your favorite space rock.\n* Make a weapon using gravity generators and artificial mass blocks.\n* Play multiplayer with your friends so you can build, explore, raid and fight pirates together.\n* Go on servers and enjoy the different game setups available.\n* Torment your friends with the gravity weapon you made.\n* Lose your friends...\n* And find them again using a well built communication relay. (Once you've built that as well)\n* Just kidding I still haven't found them, I just like to fly around in my intergalactic space ship (I designed it myself. Let me show some of the different lengths of wire I used.)\n* Write a review to praise it's ingenuity. (Just like I did right now, yay)\n\nThis isn't for the faint-of-hearted when it comes to sandbox games though, but the final payoff with any project is always awe-inspiring.\n\nAlso with the addition of planets as well as other goodies like a thriving modding community, you can customize your game according to your taste.\n\nThis game isn't a virtual world, it's a virtual universe!\n\nHonestly, buy this game, get your friends to buy it too.

Planets are an unfinished, glitchy feature with lots of half-baked ideas shoved into them. Ship to ship combat is... There, but there's no real point to it. There's no auto-repair systems and the structure of your ship is tinfoil, so unless you're fighting in creative (You know, being a child smashing his toys together) you'll spend maybe a minute trying to shred an enemy and the next two hours patching holes in your hull and replacing damaged equipment. True, there is survival, and early game survival is fun, but sooner or later one of two things will happen.\n\nIf you're playing with the enemies disabled, you will struggle to find power and oxygen. Resource managment is gonna be difficult. A minor mistake in piloting a mining ship will cost you dearly. It's actually pretty tense and you'll have to think about how to survive... But then you'll tip. You'll build a bigger base, then a bigger ship, and you'll feel accomplished. Then you'll upscale again. Then again. Then again. Resources are no longer an issue, so it now becomes a case study in how much of a pain in the ♥♥♥ welding every single hull plate of a capital ship can be.\n\nIf you're brave enough to play with enemies on, you will die. The resources required to make even small arms ammunition are scarce. Very scarce. Every time I've ever played I built building-sized mining vessels before I had bullets for my rifle. That might actually be an interesting choice if the enemies appeared when you met some abitrary condition, but they don't. If you're in space, a big Argevantis cruiser is gonna show up and raze everything you spent hours building because there's no way you can adequately defend yourself against it. If you're on planets, have fun, because space spiders and cyberhounds are going to rip you a new ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as soon as you land.\n\n"But I'll join a cooperative ser-" No you won't. In a game as horifically glitchy as this, you won't play with more than 2 or 3 friends at a time. Physics has always been SEs biggest failing, and though they've made major strides there's still a very long way to go. Even if you could find one, there's no asset protection outside of a big gun. If you didn't play for 3 weeks with no sleep and build a deathstar, someone is going to come along and take everything from you.\n\nWhile I'm thinking of Physics, Spacecraft design is all art and no science. If you've played KSP, Robocraft, Gmod, or any similar games, you know the challenge of balacing your CoM and CoT. You know that long ships have high rotational inertia, but thrusters mounted further from your center of mass generate more torque. There's a million different engineering tradeoffs you can explore. Space engineers has... None of this. Rotation is handled exclusively by gyros, so even if you try to build manuvering thrusters they will do nothing. The physics engine simply cannot comprehend that applying thrust on unbalanced vectors will impart a rotation. The only engineering challenge you face is "But how much of this crap can I cram onto a ship?" That and how much of your ship to dedicate to solid blocks of metal to absorb incoming fire.\n\nAbove all else, the Dev team seem to has no idea what to do. They go with the fist draft of an idea and almost never look back. Sometimes they get an idea right, like with Hydrogen thrusters. Thrusters that need fuel instead of power were a long requested feature, and people were happy when they were released. I was too, because I figured I could use them to make smaller and lighter ships - surely a fuel tank and a few thrusters is lighter than a big heavy nuclear reactor. Well, we were happy until we found out even sparing use of thrusters drained their fuel reserves in mere seconds. They had much better thrust, but at mindbendingly low effeciency. So low, in fact, that Keen immediately patched them to something more reasonable. They're still stupidly ineffecient - a Mercury/Redstone rocket from the 50s has preformance far superior to anything ingame - but at least you could fly for a minute or two instead of 15 seconds. Cyberhounds are the exact opposite end of the spectrum. Nobody wanted self-destructing bomb dogs that bring death and ruination upon any planetary base, but we got them.\n\nI could rant like this all day, so here's one final point. It's just not a very pretty game. Starmade might be basic but its graphics are far more polished. It does a very, very good job with what it has. Space Engineers has a DX11 powered rendering engine with 1999 level texturing and modeling work. Hell, Shores of Hazeron and Homeworld 1 more visually pleasing than this.\n\nDon't buy this game. Not now, anyway. It has a very, very long way to go and you're only gonna burn yourself out on an incomplete product. Maybe in six months they'll have addressed all these issues.","January 5","false","327.9"," 22 of 37 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","22","37","0","0"

Only exception is beta versions. Its kind of like flushing your loved ones down the toilet. Yes, I was talking about money. Well, i blame steam sales. Actually, never buy early access games, unless steam sales, and pricing under 10 bucks.\n\nAfter barely five hours......\nLike most people here, I really like what i see. Even though some may find it tideous, the game makes you WANT to build and explore. And with the co-op with friends or anyone, it makes up for a rather exciting game. If this game also get a broader and more intriguing npc factions, wildlife with both grass eaters and predators, heck maybe even fishes....it could become a great game indeed. It certainly have potential. Forget then about all those silly zombie survival games that also never vill be finished....\n\nThere seems to be huge graphichs issues with this game. At 1920 x 1080, with a Radeon HD 7870, I have to put everything to low, to have liveable framerates. Says a lot about this game, considering its not exactely high fiedlity in graphics. As a comparison, Battlefield 4 plays with everything on high at 2560 x 1440 or something like that. Also there seem to be a bug with saving game? Game only saved when i use "Save as". Like most early access games, I wouldnt exactely bet on them to finish it. But atleast I hope they iron out excisting bugs.\n\nI recomend this game if you dont mind to flush you loved ones down the toilet. Or if its on steam sales for max 10 bucks. Else, like always, dont waste money.","December 28, 2015","false","5.7"," 23 of 39 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","23","39","2","0"

They are literally adding modding tools so modders can actually finish their game (after Keen made so much money out of it and modders didn't).\n\nThe last few updates have been virtually worthless unfortunately.\n\nAfter Keen broke Survival MP again during the Christmas holidays, which was fixed an entire week later rather than doing a rollback on the spot, they added suicide dogs no one asked for, only to now break Survival MP again, with, again, something that could have been tested by three guys logging into a test server for 5 minutes. So now we gotta wait, again, potentially an entire week, until we can play Survival MP.\n\nSadly a great idea in the hands of very limited minded people.\n\nI do not recommend this game at this stage, they are launching updates every week but useless ones, not real bug fixes or optimization.

Ok so now that we have that out of they way, Space Engineers is a great game if you want to create ships with guns and blow stuff up. In its current state the multiplayer is playable but sometimes abit buggy, but that is to be expected from an alpha state. The game offers two modes, Creative and Survival. In creative mode you can build what ever you want with no need to collect resources, this is good if you just want to build some wonderfull ships. The Survival mode is just what its name suggests, unlike Creative mode you have to actually mine resources to build parts in this mode. In my personal opinion Survival mode is best played with friends as playing it alone can become boring very fast, but with friends it is very enjoyable and fun. The game is updated every Thursday which is nice as it is something to look forward to.\nIn final review I would give this game in its current state a 8.9/10, it would have been a 10 if not for some multiplayer problems, but as I said the game is updated regually so prehaps these issues will be fixed soon.\nI hope this review was helpfull.","July 23, 2014","true","495.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

Early Access is understandable, and things are going to break and become buggy.  Everyone that's buying EA games should know this, and it's written as disclaimers in a lot of games prior to even playing it.\n\nThe Developers of this game have always operated under the idea that people want content, and more content they shall have.  I don't believe this is actually to please their fanbase, but it's more of an in house quota that they're trying to meet as a business.\n\nI am not recommending this game to anyone that's currently thinking about purchasing this game.  I am also recommending that anyone who has played this game for a relatively long time that has written a review, or is thinking about writting a review to give your true honest opinion for whether or not you recommend this game given the track record of the company.\n\nI will say the cliche thing that you read time and time again, "I really want to recommend this game and give it a positive review, but with it's current state I feel I cannot."  However, the current state that is being referenced is not just this weeks most recent Forced Update (the game needs PATCHES, not updates) but more so how this game has been pumped with more content than it can currently handle given the underlying bugs from previous content pushes.\n\nI will change my review at a later date if the KeenSWH developers start polishing up the current state of the game, and by polish I mean, don't add new content, don't change animations, don't give us new sounds.  Putting lipstick on a pig, still makes it a pig, and the people that understand that will not stick around and endorse your game to their friends and especially not on an Anonymous Review board.\n\nTL:DR - Don't buy it.  Don't let the 91% positive feedback rating persuade you into thinking that the developers listen to their fanbase.","April 1","false","062.9"," 29 of 51 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","29","51","0","0"

The fact that the devs behind this godawful nightmare 1) started development on a new game (Medieval Engineers) before this one could even run properly; and 2) were totally on board with the paid mods fiasco that Valve tried to make standard, is a firm display of ethical integrity on par with the worst mainstream game publishers such as EA.\n\nIf this game is ever fixed, it'll totally be worth a purchase.

Updates are frequent and follow a content-bug fix-polish cycle.  New content seems to be prioritised based on what is most missing from the game after listening to player feedback.  The developers clearly have their own vision of the game they are making, but they listen to the audience they have attracted when deciding how best to go about integrating the many necessary elements.\n\nEarly Access games have something of a bad reputation, but the team behind Space Engineers have behaved with integrity thus far and I definitely feel I have gotten my money's worth of fun already.\n\nThe game is still clearly not a finished, bug-free, polished product.  However, barring financial considerations, I have no reason to doubt that it will be in time.\n\nI want that to happen, so I recommend this game so more people may buy it and the makers are less likely to run out of money and more likely to get a decent reward for behaving admirably.\n\nWhat is the game like itself?  Sort of advanced giant virtual lego in space I suppose.","February 20, 2015","true","329.9"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

My computer has 16 gigs of RAM, and on loading the world I get low memory warnings from Windows. On two occasions it totally crashed my system, a monster rig with 8 cores at 4.0 ghz, 16 gigs of RAM, and a GeForce 980. This is a system that can run any modern game maxed out with no problems, and this killed it.\n\nFurthermore, planets only work with DirectX 11, which is still buggy and has horrible lighting problems. They still have not fixed Windows 10 support, either. DirectX 9 mode does not work on Windows 10, and results in a stuck process that you cannot kill without restarting the entire system.\n\nHow is Keen responding to these problems? By IP banning anyone who complains from their forums, without even so much as a  warning. This is their way of silencing dissent.\n\nEverything this developer has ever promised has fallen short; Miner Wars 2081 and Miner Wars Arena were abandoned, and now they've totally failed at the most-anticipated feature in Space Engineers. Don't buy this game if you expect to be impressed or treated right as a customer. This developer is a notorious scammer: they take your money and give you empty promises, then never finish any game they make or properly implement promised features.

The game does a great job at making you feel small. Flying around space and mining off asteroids gives you a good perspective to how big the universe really is. This game does support the Steam workshop and mods are frequently being uploaded to the workshop to provide the game with new or improved content to suit your playstyle or needs. With that being said, I feel it'd be best to start with the negatives...\n\nAs I've mentioned before, this game is still in early access and is expected to have bugs and crashed here and there. From what i've experienced so far, here are some things you should take note of:\n\n- Don't try to load a world with more that 15 mods enabled, your game will most likely freeze or crash to desktop. (However, this may just be my system)\n\n- This game does require a beefy PC when it comes to running planets. I was only able to get a max framerate of 40 on a planet without foilage and on the lowest possible graphical settings. For those who do have a decent system shouldn't have any issues however.\n\n- Whilst playing on a relatives server, i've noticed anything that a client does, would also appear for the server host. E.g - I take my helmet off, it'll come up with the same message for the host. Or if I had ran out of materials for an upgrade, it'll not only tell myself, but it would also tell the host.\n\n- When connecting to lets say, a friends server with mods enabled, sometimes the mod will not install correctly and will not work. I'm having this issue currently on a relatives server and are still trying to solve it.\n\n- Changing your graphics setting from lowest to highest or vice versa can cause your game to crash.\n\n- The camera is a bit dodgy at times, especially when it comes to crouching or mining in small spaces.\n\n(There are many more that I could go into detail about, but those are the most obvious)\n\nSeeing there will be problems with any game that's in early access, don't feel it should stop you from buying it. The game is updated every now and again and the devs are trying their hardest to fix the problems. That being said, this game will keep you occupied for hours and in my opinion, is definately worth a try.","April 18","true","73.5"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","10","15","2","3"

This implies, that the concept of faction based, persistent, multiplayer game with lots of players (30+) will never be realised, which makes the game a pointless, unfinished sandbox.

The idea of a spaceship minecraft-like game with an awesome physics engine was really apealling and when I first go it I wasn't dissapointed. But this game has many issues I think you should know about before buying it. When I first bought the game it was fairly buggy but not bad for an alpha title and it's weekly releases left me confident it would only improve from there. I was wrong. The developers were so focused on adding more and more content to the game it quickly became unstable. On planets as far as I can tell maintaining a solid 30 fps is difficult and 60fps is flatout impossible. The game also encounters huge performance issues when you attempt to build larger ships so you can kiss any hopes of massive battleships goodbye. The multiplayer leaves alot to be desired with simulation speeds tanking to .60 or below. But the worst part is, despite all these issues the developers continue to release weekly updates adding more flash to the game with seemingly no intent on fixing it's performance.\n\nNow if you stay inside these limitations it is a very fun game if you enjoy building spaceships and I will still come back and play it every onceand a while. If you can learn to live with framerate issues and bugs you'll probably enjoy it too but in it's current state I just can't recommend it.","April 7","false","251.3"," 26 of 46 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","26","46","0","1"

Another Sandbox game. It's pretty much what anyone wants it to be. You can build ships as you deside to do so, make space-stations, mine minerals, make weapons, annihilate other players, you name it.\n\nIn creative, you can pretty much build whatever you want, and test your creations with infinite materials. In survival, you start with almost nothing, and you have to get everything working with your own hands. You can either do this alone, or with friends, but really guys, games like these can get boring really fast if you don't get friends to play with.\n\nThings are added constantly, and the Devs actually hear what the players say, and add things that we all suggest. Of all the "Early Access" games on Steam, I would say this is the most active one. To be fair, it's not an Alpha anymore, more like a Beta.\n\nThe game runs smoothly unless you do crazy stuff like crashing multiple large ships into each other, or a big fight between 15 or more players, each one with their own ship. Lag does happen at times in multiplayer, but anyone can make host their own server, so it's mainly the host fault. There are some griefing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s already in the game, these things happen, that's why the Devs will add some sort of "Faction" thingy, so groups of friends can go together, with their own big-♥♥♥ ship, and stuff like that. Like I said, playing alone is kinda boring, specially because you will be alone if some dumbass wants to destroy and take your stuff. Even though, it doesn't always happen, and you can set your parties to be private, or just for your friends. Also, in most servers (and in most parties, and events), people just set two teams, build their own ships, and have fun killing each other. I've been in 3 of those battles, and I can tell you, it's fun as ♥♥♥♥. Specially when you're the captain in the biggest ship of the team, trying to command your team to victory, while giving orders using Skype. Yeah, there's no communications ingame yet. That sucks.\n\nThe game is quite fun already, but still, if you want to enjoy it to the fullest, get some friends to play. If not, you should wait for a sale or price drop in a Steam-event. But be aware: The base price of the game will only rise for now on.","March 30, 2014","true","69.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/alaskafish/recommended/244850/","alaskafish","Oriental Ramen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/alaskafish/","73 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAlaskafish Reviews:\n\nHey guys, it's alaskafish, and let me give you my personal profesional gamer view of Space Engineers. You may notice I have vey little hours and I may not be trust worthy. Well... steam doesn't count when you go "offline"but still play. And I've done that for about 100 hours...\n\nBasically, it's a game about building with blocks. Like many of those creative block building games (*cough cough* minecraft *cough cough*), there seems to be a flood of new block based building games... And not to my supprise, many sucked major balls. But I will say, some did well, like this game.\n\nIf you don't know, the game is a block building game that takes in the vast fields zero gravity fields of space. It's a game of six degrees of freedom, move in anyway. Build giant spacestations with your own very gravity field, or make giant space frigits... maybe a fighter or two. It's really up to you. Experience state of the art destrction simulations... and golly, I'll say it again, it's fantasitc the destruction offered to you in this game.\n\nSo, out of the generalls, into the important stuff:\n\nI remember first be very "iffy" about this game. I was recently enjoying the much similar but much more earlier realeased "StarMade" which is the exact same concept. As we know from experience, games that come after popular games tend to be worse than the first.... However, once they showed the first of the destruction systems... I knew something may happen with this game. And I think that's what makes it good. If this game didn't have the incredably in depth destruction system, it would just be "better-graphic" starmade... but for $15. To be honest, the actual core content shipped in the game as I write this would be next to nothing as what you could do in StarMade. If it didn't have the destruction it would have just been a starmade clone...\n\nThe gameplay is also good. It's not as in depth as StarMade, but still requires some knowledge. As of know they're not that many things to do. There's creative, in which you have every block, tool, ect you'd like to use, but also special tools like symmetry or copy/paste. And there's survival, which I personally find fun, since it's pretty in depth, and time consuming. It's a challenge... But like I stated above, the lack of content and game play changers besides the physical damage system is it's falling point, as it's not really anything new.\n\nThe graphics are good... they're much nicer than most block based games... especialy with this destruction system. It's no Crysis 3, but it's much nicer to look at all the bump-mapped textures, and so on. The lighting in the game is nice, and so are the shadows... and over all, nice to look at.\n\nMultiplayer is also quite fun. But the game caters to small three to five friends who made their own server for them selves. The max amount of players at one given time can only be 16, and the maps can be very small that many, especially for survival. Server hosting is easy, as the game hosts through steam and requires no port-forwarding or what not.\n\nI'll say for sure, this game is riddled with bugs. Many may not agree with me, but I'll say there's some annoying bugs... not game breaking, but annoying. Multiplayer especially, you and you're friends will be lagged out of a server, or just get periodic lag spikes that may last up to a minute. Or sometimes you'll be teleported so far that it's impossible to fly back unless you die. And if you're playing survival that may be annoying, but in creative, you can't die so killing your self is impossible to respawn.\n\nThe game also runs for sh*t on many computers. The game is purly ran on CPU and not GPU, and that can cause lots of frame rate issues since most gaming computers focus primarily on GPU and not CPU. Also, with the lack of pretty much any graphical settings, it can hinder your game experience when the lowest graphic setting to be ran is "Normal" which includes VSYNC! Texture filtering hinders the game since you load all HD textures of the asteroids even if you are five thousand meters away. They do give you an option to choose which graphics card you'd like to use if you so happen to have more than two, but it won't let you use both... which sucks even more.\nWhen I played, my problem was the asteroids. They load the texture from so far way, including bump-mapping and all that even when you're not facing it. Playing on small maps (Four asteroids) can give medium to high end gaming PC's an FPS from 20-40. But I want to restate.... 20 is adverage. And personally, this game would probably have these graphical changing things, but as of now... no.\n\nScores:\nSo, to be honest, I like the game, but I think it's something to be played with friends... not by your self. Sure you could play singleplayer... but the experience is with a group of your three closest friends. The content lacks in the game and could be upped, and I firmly believe it will, but the one thing going for it is the amazing physics engine... I truly mean amazing. Ramming someone couldn't be any more realistic for a blocky game! The game isn't well opptimized and not many guides on how to get more FPS while playing it. The bugs hinder your game and can cause problems. Here's what I think this game should get according to me:\n\nGraphics - 7/10 - It's no Crysis 3, but it's pretty good...\nGameplay - 5/10 - It's nothing new... there's plenty of space building games that no one has heard of that has many more features, gameplay mechanisms, ect, that blow this game out of the seas.... as of now.\nKeystone Feature - Destruction - 8.5/10 - Just wounderful.\nOptimization - 4/10 - Needs more options... that's all\nBugs and overall finishing - 6/10 - Soem bugs, but not that many.\n\nOverall - (6.5 or 7)/10 (as of current build).\nAfter a few more updates in the right directions, probably a 7.5 or 8/10\n\n\nThe game isn't anything new, but is probably the best space building game there right now.\nWould I buy it though?\nI'd only get it if you and a few friends will. And make sure you have a decent rig... or else the fun may not be there for you when you end up getting a solid 21 fps when trying to mine. The content in the game may cause you to regret buying it. I surely did as soon as I bought it. I ran around, get low fps and was about to call it quits until a friend bought it. Then I actually enjoyed it a heap.\nI'd buy it later. However, the game is getting more expensive. If you plan on playing this game later,.... get it now. But remember it may get worse of better...\n\n/Alaskafish Reviews.","March 26, 2014","true","275.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Very competitive. It could be as notorious as that game "Rust", only most people are rather friendly. Who needs NPCs when you're defending your base against "trollish" pirates and idiot noobs? To be completely honest, I prefer that gameplay versus predictable computer-generated attacks. Expecially the pirates, you have to out-strategize them. Again, if you get a group of friends, it's a hell of a lot of fun.\n\nThere are NO dedicated servers yet. The developers did mention that this will change in the future, but all you should care about is now. If you prefer this kind of gameplay, sorry, users must host their own games as of now.\n\nThese developers have Thursday updates. They have been consistent, and the game is playable as of when I first purchased the game. I belive it is only going to go uphill form here. Reading reveiws from other alpha-type games, the fact that the updates are every thurday versus every month means that the developers have a vested interest in the development of the game.\n\nI am taking later courses in mechanical engineering to suppliment my understanding of naval archetecture, plant management, and other vital maintenance operations aboard giant merchant vessels. I am very impressed with the building tools this game offers, and the relative engineering principles this game offers. Besides your intuition and empirical designs, people have actually ran experiments and have scientific data. For example, do you want three large thrusters or a gravity driver? Do the math and consider your resourses and challenges.\n\nOh. Don't be "basic".\n\nLook up Relativity (by M. C. Escher). Notice the stairs. You have gravity generators.\n\nBasic people use piston elevators. "Bad" people creatively use gravity generators on their stations and large ships. Just saying.\n\nOn that note, if Mr. Escher's painting makes you vomit, beware of the total inertial freedom you have in your control.\n\n----------------\n\nTLDR Report:\n\nGood enough for the price? Yes.\n\nPRO:\n-Definition of "free body"\n-Awesome coustomization\n-Awesome physics engine/voxel/damage simulation\n-Awesome mechanics (creatively using rotors, artifical mass, and other components)\n-Awesome creativity (Everything is a little blocky, but the limit is your imagination.)\n-If you are like me, and say "screw gravity", there is no up or down.\n-The developers care, and it's only good things from here.\n\nCON:\n-No dedicated servers\n-No direct aestetic ortaments (Furnature onboard, things to make your "Engineering room" look proper besides a reactor, etc.)\n-No "Factions" (across all servers or server specific.)\n-Turrets are semi-functional (Killing pirates must be personal instead of automatic, unless they volunteer to be shot)\n-No dedicated servers.","April 20, 2014","true","283.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Very competitive. It could be as notorious as that game "Rust", only most people are rather friendly. Who needs NPCs when you're defending your base against "trollish" pirates and idiot noobs? To be completely honest, I prefer that gameplay versus predictable computer-generated attacks. Expecially the pirates, you have to out-strategize them. Again, if you get a group of friends, it's a hell of a lot of fun.\n\nThere are NO dedicated servers yet. The developers did mention that this will change in the future, but all you should care about is now. If you prefer this kind of gameplay, sorry, users must host their own games as of now.\n\nThese developers have Thursday updates. They have been consistent, and the game is playable as of when I first purchased the game. I belive it is only going to go uphill form here. Reading reveiws from other alpha-type games, the fact that the updates are every thurday versus every month means that the developers have a vested interest in the development of the game.\n\nI am taking later courses in mechanical engineering to suppliment my understanding of naval archetecture, plant management, and other vital maintenance operations aboard giant merchant vessels. I am very impressed with the building tools this game offers, and the relative engineering principles this game offers. Besides your intuition and empirical designs, people have actually ran experiments and have scientific data. For example, do you want three large thrusters or a gravity driver? Do the math and consider your resourses and challenges.\n\nOh. Don't be "basic".\n\nLook up Relativity (by M. C. Escher). Notice the stairs. You have gravity generators.\n\nBasic people use piston elevators. "Bad" people creatively use gravity generators on their stations and large ships. Just saying.\n\nOn that note, if Mr. Escher's painting makes you vomit, beware of the total inertial freedom you have in your control.\n\n----------------\n\nTLDR Report:\n\nGood enough for the price? Yes.\n\nPRO:\n-Definition of "free body"\n-Awesome coustomization\n-Awesome physics engine/voxel/damage simulation\n-Awesome mechanics (creatively using rotors, artifical mass, and other components)\n-Awesome creativity (Everything is a little blocky, but the limit is your imagination.)\n-If you are like me, and say "screw gravity", there is no up or down.\n-The developers care, and it's only good things from here.\n\nCON:\n-No dedicated servers\n-No direct aestetic ortaments (Furnature onboard, things to make your "Engineering room" look proper besides a reactor, etc.)\n-No "Factions" (across all servers or server specific.)\n-Turrets are semi-functional (Killing pirates must be personal instead of automatic, unless they volunteer to be shot)\n-No dedicated servers.","April 20, 2014","true","283.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Also dont ferget, every update they make, the next day will be a bug fix for any problems from that mistake. The devs work hard and have rising above the rest.\n\nThis game is a great spaceship/space station building game with tons of machanics that revolve around the laws of motion. There are dozen function blocks, such as; Pistons, motors, lights, drills, grinders, welders, gravity genarators!!!, and a great conveyor system.\n\nWhat you build is limited to your imagination.

It requires some patience due to its Early Access business model. It has a great deal of potential at being a nemesis to Minecraft for space exploration with better graphics, but will seemingly require a great deal of work to reach that status. You have multiple scenarios at your disposal, but in each, it is basically the same at the moment; you need to find Uranium as fast as you can while at the same time save your given energy in the games various styles of survival beginnings.\n\nThere is a multiplayer mode that is not yet in the condition it should be but it is getting there slowly but surely. Things take time, of course. Dedicated servers seem to be a step for the developers in the near future so players can build huge things with their friends...and destroy them.\n\nA decently high computer is required. Mine is sort of lower mid range at the moment and there are some graphical bugs due to that and presently multiplayer seems to me impossible to play. Like I said though, if you are a player who enjoys going out and gathering resource to build a huge space station or some ships to your exact liking with not-so-many-yet building parts yet then this is a game for you. I can't wait until it has AI to fight off however, and a faster way of moving the high amount of resources you mine from asteroids into processing and storage. It has weapons and blocks designed for item transport but it isn't finished yet due to, again, the Early Access model. It's still an Alpha build and for that, is damn good already.\n\nIn the end, a game with a great deal of potential.

I spent hours upon hours in Creative mode, just building ships. When mod/Workshop support came into play, it changed building. New weapons, blocks and even little things like a lamp.\n\nAnd yes, Survival is fun too. Better with a group of friends! In my honest opinion, it is kinda boring when you solo Survival mode.\n\nNow with the Exploration stuff, it's like a fresh way to play. You could get lost and never know what you're going to find.\n\nYou could:- Find a new asteroid to make home. Or maybe you get lucky and find a station built already!\n- Find a new ship, or even ships that players sent in for Exploration. Claim it, if you want. Scrap it, destroy it.\n\nJust becareful, some are booby trapped... D: Maybe.\n\nAudio:Awesome background music. Very chillax for floating in space~\n\nSound effects are great too, a few could use some improvements. But not a problem!\n\nOther Stuff:There's many algorithms working, especially on collision or explosions. So if you lag up, it's just stuff computing/calculating. Keep that in mind!\n\nWeekly updates are very welcomed! They're also very quick to fix bugs introduced from that update.\n\nI think that's all I wanted to cover. Hmm.

Unless you build something that doesn't move (no pistons or rotors), or only ever play single player, your creation will break immediately or at some point down the road.\n\nCreative is great fun since every time something breaks you don't need to worry about resources having been lost due to bugs and desynchronizations, you just build a new one.

It's less about following objectives as most games are these days and more about using your personal creativity to create your own fun. Like Garry's Mod but in a much cleaners, styled fashion, give users a much more streamlined building system and the tools to do whatever their heart desires. The workshop is rich with mods and other user content, and it's easy to share your creations with others, and just as easy to download and use the creations others make. Weekly updates from the developers means there are constant improvements and fixes coming to the game at a steady pace as well.\n\nHowever, in my experience when ever I have been on to play the game (Most common times players in the AEST Timezone and similar would be on) The amount of players on servers is limited at best. On rare occasions a 10-15 slot server will be full, but other than that the lack of players can mean a limited interaction with others making playing on servers providing the same experience if not less in terms of player interaction plus issues you might experience with your connection to said server. To resolve this I would highly recommend talking you friend into buying this game or even buying it for them if you wish to play multiplayer, at least until the community grows.\n\nAll in all there are probably plenty of games with a bigger player base and more content then Space Engineers, but the ability to sculpt the game to your needs is really unique feature to have in a game and no other game pulls this off better then this. There is plenty of room for new content and improvements but as it is now this is one of the best games on Steam right now and worth every cent.

It's fun, you can really push your creativity to meet the challenges of the environment the game puts you in.  However after an update to how character positioning works in multiplayer the multiplayer part of this game has become unplayable for the host.\n\nThis game is in Early Access, and I don't rate it down because of the bugs themselves, you expect them in beta releases, that's the point of Beta releases.  Instead I rate this down because how the Beta is run.\n\nFirst, Friday is a terrible day to release updates.  I'm a developer and there is a reason we release updates on a Tuesday morning. It gives us time to react if something goes wrong.  And when something goes wrong in SE there seems to be no reaction to it. Minor bugs can be fixed for the next release, but if the update breaks the game, retract it, fix it and try again next week.\n\nBut my main issue with this Early Access is that it feels like it's been used as an Alpha test. There's a big difference, by the time software goes into Beta release all obvious bugs should have been dealt with.  Beta is to increase the chance of catching obscure bugs and bugs only found by someone using your software in a way you didn't predict. With the positioning update the host's game felt like he was playing in treacle. It was so bad you wonder if the developers even played it before releasing it.\n\nI know I'm on the outside, but I'd ask the developers to review their weekly development process. And please fix the multiplayer.  An average host sim speed of about 0.5-0.6 is not acceptable, it's unplayable.","May 29","false","129.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

At this stage of game I'm very disappointed, and I will not recommended this game !!! I'm playing only MP.\n\nWhen I guy this game I love it. Game have some bugs, but works perfect, no CTD (or only few), runs smooth, FPS without problem on weak old machine. a lot of serwers, Good perfomance on serwers, driling works very good. It was something amazing to create a ships and play with this ships on MP. Becouse it is ALPHA so i say, few bugs oki, they will fix it. We have a "patch" every Thursday, and I like it, at the beginning. Now I don't play any more. I stop playing when planets arrive in to game.\n\nNow we have a game which is poor optimized, with more bugs. Each of Thursday patch fix one bug, but create 2 new bugs. :(\nUntil planets arrive in to game I was playing on DX9 even when i was able to set dx 11. Planets force you to use DX11!!\nDX11 looks awfully compared to DX9. I hate play on DX11.\nDX11 is poorly optimized!!

Even if they fix it after 2-3 weeks or more devs make that this bug return.\n- MP is almost dead ( at the beginning there was a lots of server with better performance).\n- Planets look not so good with poor performance.\n- Thursday patches are "crap" make more bugs then they fix them.\n- Drilling, welding will kill good machine, on MP kill serwer.\n- NPC with ion engines respown on plantes :] - nice boom !!!\n- New simspeed on MP\n- MP ENGINE is it a joke\n- Rotors, pistons, landing gears, merge blocks, and some other bloks don't work properly on MP.\n- Some bloks can "kill" serwer :]\n\n+ Still creating of ships is great !!!!!!\n\nMy recommendation in DON'T BUY THIS GAME. wait until devs fix this game.

However sand continues to leak out the corners and cracks. Game content needed to make the game world compelling is still not really there, new blocks and planets aren't a replacement for AI to fight, or NPCs to trade with.\n\nThis game has so much potential for modding, however the ModAPI remains very incomplete. You can get access to the source code to add things, but Keen Software refuse to assign a programmer to sift through the code people give them that would improve the game/modding. You can ask for things to be added, but months later nothing will have happened.\n\nSo Keen won't add the content the game needs, and you can't mod it in yourself.\nGame runs slower than it did 18 months ago, and needs better hardware/OS as well.\nPlayers have taken to giving a persona to the game Physics bugs, Clang the god of random explosions or crashing into things.\n","May 20","false","697.9"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","1"

Space Engineers updates weekly, sometimes even more frequently, and constantly changes, adjusts, and updates factors that may alter gameplay.\n\nI'm an aspiring aerospace engineer. I've set my sights on attending the ever prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where some say aerospace engineering was founded. Naturally, I immediately devoted some attention to Space Engineers for this reason. Using voxels, modules, and some ingenuity, you can create incredible entities. One may pay homage to great movie and show starships, or develop real-life historic vehicles largely responsible for mankind's presence in space..... or you can do whatever you want, create whatever you want, and play however you want.\n\nLet's get down to brass tacks and discuss what currently works and what could use improvement:\n\nWhat works:An innovative ship and space station creation system with robust options in function and form through voxels and parts.\nSome realistic grounding with physics, especially with inertia and momentum.\nTwo varied game modes (enduring survival and imaginative creative) with adjustable environments and settings.\nA mod-friendly execution.\nWhat could use improvement:Multiplayer. Long time veterans knew this would be first on the list. Network optimization is poor and gameplay frustrating.\nPerformance in general. This is a pressing issue to Keen Software House's Marek Rosa and should likely be addressed within the year. Let's hope!\nStatic animations most certainly testament to the game's early access nature. (Most evident with astronaut movement.)\nPainting. Painting is the stuff of nightmares. Be prepared to fight the poor paint-application system.\nWhat doesn't work:Building two separate station / habitats and connecting them together with voxels. (Some things are just too difficult to cut-and-paste.) This is an exercise in patience.\nUltimately, Space Engineers is a fascinating game. If you have any desire to design, create, and fly your own spacecraft, then this is a wonderful experience. Share your creations with your friends, enjoy the vast network of mods available to you, and start your own space empire!","January 27","true","445.1"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

The second issue...the bootlickers who cry "it's Alpha".\nWell, Alpha means full steam ahead for development. This is NOT the case with SE. If anything, the original team packed up long ago and the game is floundering. I would almost classify the game as abandonware. There are huge issues with the game (mostly multiplayer) which have existed for months. If they can't address these, how can they claim the game is in Alpha and moving forward? It's ridiculous.\n\nSomehow, they have reached the point where they cannot seem to move it forward without breaking things severely. Patches are something to be afraid of.\n\nThe game has incredible potential, it's just struggling to find someone to take it there.\nWe spend HOURS and DAYS trying to make things work.

I left dissappointed."\n\nBefore you get your panties all bunched up, this is an EARLY ACCESS REVIEW, as stated above. This is not a final review, it's merely a disclosure for people who would buy the game AS IS, NOW. The fact that it's so difficult for people to grasp is quite saddening.\n\n\nThis game is grand. Grand is scale and looks. It has great mechanics and fantastic multiplayer potential.\n\n\nHowever it falls well short of any sort of longevity. The Survival mode itself revolves around plugging yourself into an outlet and charging up energy. In the "Survival" mode there's basically one thing you need to do. Mine.\nSo pick up a drill, make a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ship and go dig a hole. That's it. Progression? There is none. Blueprints, unlockable schematics, anything? Nope. Earthworm Engineers more like it.\nBuild a space station out of the same four blocks you'll use for everything else and..do NOTHING with it. Can't even decorate it with ..well..anything.\n\nIt's beautiful, it has potential to be an expansive, amazing, hardcore survival / exploration game..yet the devs have recently shot down any sort of interest in including anything that would enhance a multiplayer survival mode. Expansive world to explore, but guess what..there's nothing in it! The developers decided against adding any form of AI. So no enemies, no rebel ships trying to shoot you down. NOTHING. That is what this game really amounts to. Shiny, shiny nothingness.\n\nSure, you can mess with physics, do some fun stuff like that. Go into creative and build a massive ship. That's awesome! But what's the point? In "Survival" building..well..anything nets you..well..nothing. There's nothing opposing you, nothing. Mining nodes are not varied, random ghost ships float around and do nothing, and there are no planets or structures to go to.\n\n\nIn my honest opinion they should hand this game over to the modding community and let some people with actual ambition and scope get on the project. The modders of Minecraft came up with a more indepth and exciting "Space" mod. I had to worry about oxygen, food, light, a home, my suit, finding blueprints, expanding my station, avoiding monsters.\n\nJust beneath the surface is something great, it's awfully sad to see the developers squandering it. But it's their game and my money, and I'll be taking it elsewhere in the future.\nThe bottom line is that if you wan't progression and longevity of your playtime, this is not the game for you. And for me, progression and development are key. So it's not for me, and I don't have to defend that.\n\n"General Statement. These are my thoughts on the game. Any opposing or likeminded feelings are welcome to be directed and discussed at me, however, don't be an idiot about it."","October 5, 2014","false","20.3"," 224 of 432 people (52%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","52","224","432","4","37"

The rest is solid and fun.\n\nI am looking forward to what the future brings for space engineers!","April 7, 2014","true","114.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I've spent more time than I like to admit on this game due to the fact that it allows for a challenging, but rewarding experience. As a space engineer, you are unable to perform too many tasks on your own, as your inventory is severely limited and welding/grinding/mining speeds are too slow for massive builds.

Then you do it again for fun. Then you build a big ship and crash it into everything. Then you build a giant space station for no reason but other to look cool. Then you play survival and die instantly because you forgot to refill your energy even though Glados is yelling at you to refill it.\n\nDon't mention the multiplayer aspect, it's pretty much all I said times 10. And awesome dogfights and other fun gamemodes that you can make up yourself!

This game is a excellent game where you can build any type of space ship you want. Great game to play together to survive the meteor showers and for building up your own economical base.\nThe game has good graphics, doesn`t glitch, and has frequent updating. In updates they add very good items such as sensors and newer cockpits and other building materials. I find the idea amazing of producing artificial gravity in a environment containing microgravity, the idea is great. They made the physics of this game realistic (such as the moment of Inertia, and that there is no friction in space). In the loading screen there is something to read (quotes from Astronomers like Galileo Galilei, Isaac Newton, and many others) instead of just having a screen with a picture and a sign saying: Loading...\n\nMAIN COMMENT: Good game, good physics, good ideas, great building materials (being expanded every month), and plenty of settings to create a environment which you would want.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TGND/recommended/244850/","TGND","TGND","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TGND/","128 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nLet me first say that regardless of my small playtime in this game, I've still been keeping tabs on the development and workings of it.\n\nQuite honestly, this game is the model by which all other early access indie games should abide by.\n\nMost early access games will put out a game and do a billion bug fixes in their update and/or attempt to release some new content that just leads to loads more bugs to fix, and they all rely on the excuse "Oh, but it's early access." These guys are not the same. Although things do have their bugs (as does all code), the developers of this game always tend to pump out new things that add another nice element to the game in addition to fixing the bugs that may have existed from older builds.\n\nWhat's even better about it is that bugs are far less common in this game than in other early access games! It's great to see quality work in such a small span of time (every 7 days or so). This shows me that there are still some indie devs out there that don't take complete advantage of the "Well, it's an alpha" excuse, which is such a rarity amongst the top indie game devs (no offense to them, I'm only speaking my honest opinion). Due to this, I can confidently say that even though this game is amongst the top selling steam games, I truly think it deserves more attention and credit that it already has. Why? I've just explained it all to you, but allow me to list it:\n\n1.) Consistent weekly updates\n2.) Clean work-even though their updates are weekly, they're not sloppy or just tossed in to satisfy the consumer\n3.) When bugs do arise, they fix them in a timely manner\n4.) This game has immense potential to be an amazing sandbox experience, and is already pretty awesome as is\n\nNow everyone who reads this might say "Oh, stop kissing the devs asses so much!" To that, all I have to say is, "Why?" This game deserves every bit of praise I gave it. People may try to bring up this bug and that bug, but in the end, this is an early access game done right. No ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, no "It's alpha, so it's okay if there's loads of bugs, many of which may break the game", no waiting horribly long for updates, nothing but quality work. If the devs of this game can do this, I don't see why other indie devs cannot, especially when this game isn't even recieving as much attention as some others.\n\nThose working on this game put in truly hard work, no matter who you compare them to. If that's not worth the 20 bucks, then I don't know what is. A sincere "thank you" to the devs for keeping my hopes in quality indie game devloping alive.\n\n*Disclaimer*\nDon't get me wrong, there are some other good indie developers out there, just not many, and this is just the team that got my attention.","July 12, 2014","true","19.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The perfect combination of Minecraft Creativity combined with fun with physics we find in games like Garry's mod. Although many early access games have been an amazing waste of time and money, this game offers the player an original and addicting experience. Creative is a lot of fun, but from the survival gamemode I still expect great things (Although not being at all boring). All of you who have not bough this game yet; BUY! BUY! BUUUUUUUY!\n\nEdited: 25-6-2015\nThe survival has more than developped into a well run machine. The addition of mods make the experience a lot more fun as well. Besides the fun with physics we are getting more and more options to operate the ship systems. Sensors allow you to automate systems within an area for example.

I really enjoy perfecting the ideas for my ships, and this game is perfect for that.\n\nMy main problem with it is that building is redundant.\nHowever, this is likely just my tendency to get bored easily. The game actually has ways to make building faster, such as symmetry and a function to place a large amount of blocks at once.\n\nIt will take a little while to get used to the controls and game mechanics, but it isn't really a notable issue, and you can get used to the controls within an hour of playing.\n\nThis game also has the potential for an amazing ship-to-ship combat simulator, if you can get enough people in your game.\n\nYou also need a fairly good computer to play this game smoothly, especially if you plan on building larger structures.\n\nOverall. I recommend this game to anyone who wants to build ships and structures in space, and people who have fun ideas and like to build them.\n\nFeel free to contact me if you want more information as to how I rate this game, or if you have any questions.","April 30, 2014","true","77.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

These guys are not the same. Although things do have their bugs (as does all code), the developers of this game always tend to pump out new things that add another nice element to the game in addition to fixing the bugs that may have existed from older builds.\n\nWhat's even better about it is that bugs are far less common in this game than in other early access games! It's great to see quality work in such a small span of time (every 7 days or so). This shows me that there are still some indie devs out there that don't take complete advantage of the "Well, it's an alpha" excuse, which is such a rarity amongst the top indie game devs (no offense to them, I'm only speaking my honest opinion). Due to this, I can confidently say that even though this game is amongst the top selling steam games, I truly think it deserves more attention and credit that it already has. Why? I've just explained it all to you, but allow me to list it:\n\n1.) Consistent weekly updates\n2.) Clean work-even though their updates are weekly, they're not sloppy or just tossed in to satisfy the consumer\n3.) When bugs do arise, they fix them in a timely manner\n4.) This game has immense potential to be an amazing sandbox experience, and is already pretty awesome as is\n\nNow everyone who reads this might say "Oh, stop kissing the devs asses so much!" To that, all I have to say is, "Why?" This game deserves every bit of praise I gave it. People may try to bring up this bug and that bug, but in the end, this is an early access game done right. No ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, no "It's alpha, so it's okay if there's loads of bugs, many of which may break the game", no waiting horribly long for updates, nothing but quality work. If the devs of this game can do this, I don't see why other indie devs cannot, especially when this game isn't even recieving as much attention as some others.\n\nThose working on this game put in truly hard work, no matter who you compare them to. If that's not worth the 20 bucks, then I don't know what is. A sincere "thank you" to the devs for keeping my hopes in quality indie game devloping alive.\n\n*Disclaimer*\nDon't get me wrong, there are some other good indie developers out there, just not many, and this is just the team that got my attention.","July 12, 2014","true","19.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The perfect combination of Minecraft Creativity combined with fun with physics we find in games like Garry's mod. Although many early access games have been an amazing waste of time and money, this game offers the player an original and addicting experience. Creative is a lot of fun, but from the survival gamemode I still expect great things (Although not being at all boring). All of you who have not bough this game yet; BUY! BUY! BUUUUUUUY!\n\nEdited: 25-6-2015\nThe survival has more than developped into a well run machine. The addition of mods make the experience a lot more fun as well. Besides the fun with physics we are getting more and more options to operate the ship systems. Sensors allow you to automate systems within an area for example. Ingame scripts can be run through Programable blocks.\n\nAll and all, this game is worth much more than they ask for it. But they won't, because they aren't EA.

I love the survival mode but Creative is a great way to stretch your imagination and make something epic or a world to play survival in. The ability to switch game settings and options for saved worlds makes saved games very replayable and customizable. 8.5/10 The only thing missing from this game is some PVP modes not just PVP servers and is missing mobs.

I really enjoy perfecting the ideas for my ships, and this game is perfect for that.\n\nMy main problem with it is that building is redundant.\nHowever, this is likely just my tendency to get bored easily. The game actually has ways to make building faster, such as symmetry and a function to place a large amount of blocks at once.\n\nIt will take a little while to get used to the controls and game mechanics, but it isn't really a notable issue, and you can get used to the controls within an hour of playing.\n\nThis game also has the potential for an amazing ship-to-ship combat simulator, if you can get enough people in your game.\n\nYou also need a fairly good computer to play this game smoothly, especially if you plan on building larger structures.\n\nOverall. I recommend this game to anyone who wants to build ships and structures in space, and people who have fun ideas and like to build them.\n\nFeel free to contact me if you want more information as to how I rate this game, or if you have any questions.","April 30, 2014","true","77.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Although what you may see at first may be like, Wtf, this is Minecraft, but it is not.  Go jump right in survival mode and try to figure things out, or you could go on Youtube and watch a Let's Play. Either is fine. The gameplay is a little slow at first, but then it goes to be one of the most immersive games you will ever play. The survival constantly gives you things to do and gives you more objectives to do solo or with your friends.  For an example you need to go build a mining ship to get uranium ore for your reactor.  Or then, you need to collect resources to build a refinery so you can convert the uranium or into ingots.\nAlthough if you dont like slower-paced build-it games then go back to CoD.  Like I said, the gameplay is slow at first but you wont even care when you have so many things and oppertunites to take and do.\n\nI highly reccomend this game, but only to some people, because not one game can please everyone.","August 9, 2014","true","28.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

But once you know how to play the game, its fun to survive. And of course you can also ♥♥♥♥ the whole galaxy up with some crazy killer ship you build in creative mode. This game also have some random things sometimes like meteors shooting down places (you can turn those off if you dont like randomly loosing something on your ship/station or dying) Theres also other ships that will just fly in randomly like private sails and commercial satelites (of course you can turn them off) that has sentry guns that will shoot you if you get too close, and lets not forget you get to choose if you want a small, large or extreme amount of asteroids. Multiplayer is also REALLY fun both with friends and random people, survival is hard in the beginning, but becomes fun after you get more experienced while creative is fun from the beginning, but i would recommend watching the tutorial because it has some really usefull stuff.

Then take your ship and go land on an alien planet, and do your best to stay alive against those "space spiders"!\n\n\nMultiplayerMultiplayer was added along the way to this game, as the community desired it the most.\nThis resulted in KSH getting it added as soon as possible, which while it works, it does glitch out, but have no fear.\nThe multiplayer is being re-worked completely and we can already see the effects from this. (EG: Space Master Mode)\n\nPlanetsAlot of users have been complaining about the performance with planets, and I guess it was slightly expected that they would have a decent performance hit.\nSadly, this performance hit can make the game unplayable for most users (Altho, I don't have any issue with running them.)\nWhat does sadden me, is that people started to give negative reviews to the game because of this, claiming "they broke the game completely", but this is so incorrect.\n\nYou can always just launch a world without planets (There is literately nothing preventing you from doing this),  and continue playing like you did before. And then just wait until the game receives more optimization.\n\nConclusionFor me, this game is one of the best space building/survival type game i've played so far.\nSeeing the progress this game has made when it first went onto Early Access to where we are now, is quite impressive.\nThe developers are focused and never fail to deliver new content every week\n\nIf anyone would ask me to recommend this game, I'd give a big thumbs up and say yes.","December 3, 2015","true","452.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

While the study of space is carried out mainly by astronomers with telescopes, the physical exploration of space is conducted both by unmanned robotic probes and human spaceflight.\n\nWhile the observation of objects in space, known as astronomy, predates reliable recorded history, it was the development of large and relatively efficient rockets during the early 20th century that allowed physical space exploration to become a reality. Common rationales for exploring space include advancing scientific research, uniting different nations, ensuring the future survival of humanity and developing military and strategic advantages against other countries.\n\nSpace exploration has often been used as a proxy competition for geopolitical rivalries such as the Cold War. The early era of space exploration was driven by a "Space Race" between the Soviet Union and the United States, the launch of the first man-made object to orbit the Earth, the USSR's Sputnik 1, on 4 October 1957, and the first Moon landing by the American Apollo 11 craft on 20 July 1969 are often taken as landmarks for this initial period. The Soviet space program achieved many of the first milestones, including the first living being in orbit in 1957, the first human spaceflight (Yuri Gagarin aboard Vostok 1) in 1961, the first spacewalk (by Aleksei Leonov) on 18 March 1965, the first automatic landing on another celestial body in 1966, and the launch of the first space station (Salyut 1) in 1971.\n\nAfter the first 20 years of exploration, focus shifted from one-off flights to renewable hardware, such as the Space Shuttle program, and from competition to cooperation as with the International Space Station (ISS).\n\nWith the substantial completion of the ISS[1] following STS-133 in March 2011, plans for space exploration by the USA remain in flux. Constellation, a Bush Administration program for a return to the Moon by 2020[2] was judged inadequately funded and unrealistic by an expert review panel reporting in 2009.[3] The Obama Administration proposed a revision of Constellation in 2010 to focus on the development of the capability for crewed missions beyond low earth orbit (LEO), envisioning extending the operation of the ISS beyond 2020, transferring the development of launch vehicles for human crews from NASA to the private sector, and developing technology to enable missions to beyond LEO, such as Earth/Moon L1, the Moon, Earth/Sun L2, near-earth asteroids, and Phobos or Mars orbit.[4] As of March 2011, the US Senate and House of Representatives are still working towards a compromise NASA funding bill, which will probably terminate Constellation and fund development of a heavy lift launch vehicle (HLLV).[5]\n\nIn the 2000s, the People's Republic of China initiated a successful manned spaceflight program, while the European Union, Japan, and India have also planned future manned space missions. China, Russia, Japan, and India have advocated manned missions to the Moon during the 21st century, while the European Union has advocated manned missions to both the Moon and Mars during the 21st century.\n\nFrom the 1990s onwards, private interests began promoting space tourism and then private space exploration of the Moon (see Google Lunar X Prize).","December 4, 2014","true","360.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

If you like sandbox-y classics like Minecraft, you will love Space Engineers. Dev's work hard to update the game as often as every week.

Plenty of servers to mess around on and the convienent option to play on 'soft server/LAN' mode (you basically make your world public or friend-visible) rather than having to host your own server. Great if you don't plan on trying to build a big community and just want to mess around with a couple of friends.\n\nA real nice recent addition was Blueprints. Basically, it enables you to save your precious builds and not have to care about your stuff getting blown to hell. Before, you have to make an offline private 'hangar/shipdock' world to build your designs and save them and import them to other worlds. Now you can just make something, save it to blueprints and take them with you to other maps, worlds and servers.\n\nA small irritation, not even what I would consider a Con: The world generation options are a bit limited. I would like to see the ability to have a TRUE randomly generated world like Minecraft where every so many 100 kilometers or so, new asteroid fields spawn. However, currently, when you make a map, you select an option for a small (around 3), medium (6) or large (10+) asteroids centralized in the middle of the map. Everything outside of that is just dead space. Now granted, if you run your own server, you can spawn asteroids at locations all you want. But it would still be nice to have the randomly generated world truely.. well, generate stuff other than empty space. Small asteroid clusters and other intersteller phenemena. I think by doing so it will make the game more fun and give way to more of an exploration feeling. Plus, in Survival mode, you really cant afford to leave the asteroid fields and not have access to raw materials.","October 6, 2014","true","208.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

But I recommend it to ONLY people who like over complicated and relentlessly hard/sometimes annoying gameplay style, where physics in this game is very realistic, and all of your stats are based on a strict real life scenario, an engineer.\n\nStory Line/campaign: Does not exist (yet)\nGameplay/replayability/learning curve: 2/10\nGame mechanics/GUI: 6/10\nAI: 10/10\nGraphics/art/models/animation: 9/10\nFunctionality/performance: 6/10\nContent provided: 10/10\n\nSurvival: 1.5/5\nCreative: 4/5\n\nNow why are these scores looking generous yet I'm not recommending the game? So let's start off with saying what is right with the game.\n\nPlanets. 'Nuff said. Planets are huge and blow away 99% of the audience's expectations, INCLUDING mine. Planets are big, Space is big, you can jump your ship across a freaking galaxy, and when you get up to Space, OH... is it rewarding. Resources come at you generously, and you don't have to worry about gravity, and it is so... realistic. Launching a rocket up into space is both hard, and rewarding. The content levels are extreme, and visually + sounds... it's amazing. The full combinations of things you can build/make is great, and the developers of this game are excellent. The detail into imagination of creation is tons better than Minecraft, and you can program your ship to GIVE COMMANDS or MAKE IT AN AI!!!! Though it is lonely... so you should make AI to fend off against other AI.\n\nBut...\n\nAs much as it pains me to admit, the game Space Engineers will never be enjoyable to play. The game is fun at times, but it has a limit of fun because of how the game is played and made. Now don't get me wrong, planets is extremely perfect and the devs could NOT have made it any better. The expectations are over the top. But what is wrong with the game?\n\nSurvival, the controls, and everything about the game via core mechanics and controls is HORRIBLE. You have to keep an ever watch on physics, building blocks take forever to build with limited inventory space, and running back and forth from destination to destination getting this and that component at quantities of 10-100 of EACH component, trying to remember what any object requires, topped with your oxygen AND energy AND jetpack hydrogen ticking down is the most ridiculous thing I have encountered on this entire planet! The game is not even worth playing, when things you build, die and disappear so freaking frequently, that you'll also rage quit once every play through and probably not play the game for another while.\n\nLag is a big concern. Objects colliding is a big deal, and the attempt at generating thousands of trees is a cumbersome experience. Ship parts gets destroyed and disappear at hilarious times when not supposed to, multiplayer servers take time to respond to commands, and few other bugs/glitches to take away from enjoyment, but slightly. Still immersive in the long run, but the core mechanics of this game is extremely stupid, tacked on with bugs makes you sit there pondering at the game.\n\n...replayability and learning curve is JUST NO. Why would I want to replay my game when the game keeps crashing, my ships keep crashing, I keep dying easily, and blocks are TOO DANG HARD to construct?!?!?! How are you supposed to learn any of this? Because of horrible learning curves, 85-90% of my friends don't wanna play survival, ever.\n\nFinally the GUI. What... the... hell is up with the build command complexity. You start with blocks in your quickslots you probably don't use, figuring out how to equip weapons is all tiresome, stiffly implemented, and hard to figure out. The control panel??? A mess. So many clusterfeck options that your brain goes numb, and the defaults of wheels is so WTFU, that building a vehicle on land takes AGES to figure out and get working correctly.\n\nGoing back to core gameplay mechanics, sure the game is supposed to be slow. I get that, but if you have actual flaws to deal with, it is like a clog in your brain. SURE... you can store items into your containers and build welders on your ships and stuff and start weldin' but your welders if they even TOUCH objects at times, they just explode along with your resources and then that butt hurt flows through you like a disease of TROLLING... then you'll probably sit back and ponder at the screen for 5-30 minutes wondering, "what am I doing with my life?"\n\nThe 300 hours I spent into this game is mostly me building up whatever I want (which is the cool part about the game), exploring planets, coding AI, and going back into the game to see new updates released every Thursday.\n\nThis is why I do not recommend the game. I'm sorry. I really am... as I like this game, but I want to like it more...\n\nPS: I know it is in alpha still, but the potential in this game still exists... yet the devs ignore gameplay value over "perty graphics" and eye candy.","January 4","false","352.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It has a moderate learning curve which quickly ramps up depending on how sophisticated you want to go. Like the name says, this game is about engineering solutions to problems and many of those problems are ones you want to create. Want high explosives? Find and mine the minerals. Want to pirate ships? Find ways to attack them or neutralize them (and beware of booby traps), or set up a sever and invite your mates along to help out (copies of SE required). Want to program in C#? No? Well you don't have to but the option is there if you want to create sophisitcaed control and read out systems. Or you can just go in to creative mode and smash stuff into each other in the fully destructive environment.\nDevelopers regularly (and I mean weekly) release bug fixes and occasionally new content and the modding community is active with some very nice mods out there including things like Star Wars which allow for a multiplayer wing attack.\nIf you like a sophisitcated sandbox with the capacity to make overly sophisicated machinery that can catastrophically fail, this is for you.\nNote, while this game is "technically" early access and some catastrphic failures can be bugs it is remarkably robust and very playable.","April 10","true","290.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

With constant updates, great modding community and active servers all around it doesn't just dump you in the world and let you fend for youself. Playing the game does, however, plant you in the middle of nowhere and you have to figure stuff out. That is great. Multiplayer suvival is fun, with multiple ways of making your ways around the universe. Creative, of which I've only played SP, is awesome. The amount of things you can build and design, even without mods, is amazing. It does fit into the same catergory as Rust, that being the "I'm an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with a bigger gun than you" but it takes longer and is harder to achieve getting some serious fire power and every fight leaves you with something to do, like repairing damaged hulls or reloading rocket launchers. 9/10","March 22, 2015","true","67.2"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

You combine the wonder of space with (somewhat) futuristic technology with man and you get this. Floating around in a 3d environment with no gravity is mesmerizing, as well as getting caught in the orbit of your own gravity field. Everything is destructible, and for a sandbox game as detailed as it is..it's surprisingly non linear feeling and particles even fly off things that are destroyed. Actual physical non blocky particles that have their own physics. Just amazing. You start off in a tiny spaceship. Your goal is to find an astroid, mine. Do whatever. Build a base, establish a gravity field in it. Get a constant flow of fuel for your gravity (Uranium I believe) Hijack rouge or abandoned ships that are faraway and often difficult to reach and get control of, as they're turned off and are drifting through space. While this is difficult, it can really pay off in terms of materials, fuel, and having a huge spaceship to either use or add onto and make it into your own kind of spaceship. Their is an uncountable variety of things you can do/build in this game, as well as very fun space combat. Space combat is very expensive and can often destroy what took you nearly an hour to build. Ramming ships into others is often looked down upon (atleast in friendly servers) but it is very fun to send your own ship flying through another and making a big hole. Everything feels free and non linear. I raite this game 9.6 out of 10. You can do amazing things especially if you've got a few hours or more to sink into this game with a friend or two.","March 7, 2015","true","10.0"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","7","11","3","1"

While the wonderful screenshots and description of this game are very convincing; the game runs like utter garbage. The developers have built their own engine for this game, but as others have mentioned as well: The game somehow feels like a Unity game. It is well stated that the game is in fact not based off Unity, but the poor performance optimizations tend to shed some similarity between them.\n\nBecause this is early access, this sort of problem at the moment; is fully excusable. If the game goes out of early access, then this will be a big problem for many gamers. As other reviewers (even positive ones have mentioned); the game's potential is great and the concepts that it lays out are very unique from other open-world sandbox titles. But if the developers don't start focusing on major performance optimizations, then I expect this game will fall short for a long crowd. My FPS in the game with a GTX 680 4GB card never goes any higher than 28 FPS, and often dips to 3 FPS with all the graphics on low.\n\nOverall, unless you have a GTX titan with 12 GB of RAM and a Core I7 with 4.0 GHz, you will probably not be able to enjoy this game (the low settings make it look really ugly.)","December 27, 2015","false","5.5"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","1"

I really love it. It clicked into everything I've wanted from a sandbox. It's a great time consumer, it's a game I've always wanted to be made. Bought it ages ago for a relatively huge amnount of money, but I didn't regret it.\nUntil since about half a year things went worse. The once smooth performance went drastically low, the game itself is plagued with bizarre glitches after every update. None of those things seem to be addressed - adding more irrelevant content took all the shiny spotlight.\n\nI don't have the best computer but it used to run satisfyingly good; now it's a 800x600 nightmare in about 30 fps... if I don't build too much. Maybe if there was some sort of a warning that I'll have to buy a 3x times more powerful PC after a certain number of patches I wouldn't be ranting.\n\nAnd even if I had a real gaming rig, Space Engineers would still be unplayable. Multiplayer is a distant memory; there's no real way of enjoyably playing with someone. Single player is not much better.\nEverything just explodes, lags, disconnects and crashes. Rotors and landing gears generate more explosive force than actual warheads in the game. Nothing works like it's supposed to. Mining anything is a suicide either literally or performance-wise. Wheeled vehicles can't go a hundred yards without making tons of collision noises, eventually falling apart and exploding or plummeting into the void under the planet surface. Explosions? Explosions! Mr. Torgue must have approved.\n\nNot to mention that actual content is dusty and lacking (What about ladders? hatches? hinges? treads? everything in the workshop?), and must be expanded through gazillion mods that put a strain on the dying performance - or just don't load.\n\nThe devs weekly address those issues through their own vision of needed content: the likes of self-detonating dogs (as if eveyrthing wasn't exploding anyway), different colored "new" tool variants no one cares about or "modding support" to things that have been already modded ages ago. What's the point of forcing weekly updates and showing off unneeded things if people want a functionable game ?\n\nSorry KEEN but unless you start making the actual game playable after all these terrible months, I'll have to tell people: don't waste your money on it like I did. And I was a real maniac, I really loved the thing. I know you're just a bunch of indie devs and you always had my sympathy for making this experience possible. I would still be building tons of stuff for the sake of enjoying it... if this game worked.\n\nStart listening to your players, they're the ones funding this ordeal.

They regularly break basic functions of the game with "patches" and render it effectively impossible to play multiplayer for long periods of time. They almost never communicate anything of substance to the community and generally seem unaware of the damage they do to their brand (and the aggravation they cause) by releasing untested, ridiculous, unwanted "content," refusing to acknowledge almost all of the bugs and problems in the game, failing to do what they say with respect to the direction of the game (claiming for example that creation of new content would stop and bugfixing would become a priority), and seeming overall to be disorganized and incompetent with little desire to fix and finish their so-called "alpha" game (where it's been for two entire years). The game could be great were it not for Keen.

If you love free roam space games this is definately a great game for you. But the game os very clunky and by the time someone learns to play the game, it could be annoying and awkward. Overall the game needs more work and I understand the game is in early access but I'm just stating the current position of the game, which needs work. Things that would help improve the game would be better optimization and make the inventory and UI less awkward. If your computer isnt very good at running these type of games it definately wont be a fun experience.\n","November 22, 2015","false","1.5"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","3"

This game was poorly designed, making you believe it is just your hardware, but I am trying to play it with 8 gigs of ram and a gtx 660 ti. The game loads very slow into a world while freezing and making windows not respond, the graphics look horrible and still act like it requires a 980 just to play this crap. Just my opinion, if you don't like it move along. Only buy this game if you want to play in DX 9 mode without planets. The whole game should have just been done using DX 9 since DX 11 still looks like ♥♥♥♥ and demands more performance than should be required just to enable planet build mode. The devs of this game must not give a ♥♥♥♥ about fixing performance issues, you can clearly tell that this should not be a very demanding game.

These are being fixed, but can be very annoying. Serious FPS issues even with good computers.\n\nBuild massive battleships, build drone warships and amazing workshops to make fighters, warheads, nuclear drones or recon ships. Use comm links to increase your visuals or drone range. This game allows you to make tons of cool bases and starships on asteroids, moons or planets.\n\nCrazy amount of playability, giving you 100s of hours of fun with friends or by yourself, building small or big bases that will house your power, ammo, minerals, building materials and everything you need to succeed in the cold darkness of space or the warm embrace of a planet.\n\nYou can build mining ships with huge cargo bays to harvest minerals like iron, platinum, gold, nickle and several more to make different tools, building materials and other neat stuff. You will then need a welding ship to help create large buildings or mass produce fighters or more welders/miners. Oh, and your going to need a building or main ship to refine all that ore, store it and process it into useable materials.\n\nThe game is buggy, as it requires large amounts of data and takes a toll on your machine, causing crashes and game loss. The game can also cause FPS issues. It has some serious game breaking glitches on occasion and can be very frustrating. Things like rubberbanding, glitching, random mess ups like your ship not stopping and other things are common, save often and keep backups of all your saves.\n\nFrequent updates and a very active developer makes this game promising, hopefully having some major bug fixes and performance upgrades in the future.\n\nI enjoy playing this with my two friends, having built a massive starship and several fighters, a mining ship, a welder, drones and a large warship with a fighter dock, gatling and missle turrets.\n\nRecently, we have built a massive earth base along with a planetary long range ship with a coil cannon and fighters to bomb pirate bases.\n\nYou can explore the massive planets for minerals, ice and fuel.

This is the world that waits for you in Space Engineers, a voxel-based sandbox game similar to Minecraft but with enough twists to mark its own territory in the genre.\n\nIn Space Engineers, you must temper the harsh realities of space with a limited set of tools:  A space suit that lasts only a few minutes before requiring a recharge, a set of construction tools (Welder, Grinder, and Drill), and perhaps a space station or ship to keep you alive with scant Uranium fuel.  To last more than a couple of hours, you must find more fuel, via mining ore, which must be put through a refinery before it can be used.  Without Uranium, you can't make more, so making a mistake will cost you your life - and if your ship runs out of fuel - may cost you your progress.  Beyond basic survival, the stars are the limit.  You have your choice of producing the parts for and constructing small ships, large ships, or space stations.  The latter two cost an incredible amount of resources but are strangely satisfying to slave away welding together 2.5 metre blocks of steel for hours on end.  Time invested mining can be minimized with construction of a mining ship and a base to properly refine your ore.\n\nThough scarcely an Alpha version, Space Engineers is an incredibly fun and rewarding experience, but as such you must be willing to put up with occasional glitches and clunky multiplayer.","April 30, 2014","true","170.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I would slap them upside the head for saying that cuz dis gaem is AWESOME!!\nfirst you're in space\nsecond you can build a ship\nthird you can blow ♥♥♥♥ up\nthis game is so ingenuitive and amazing because of all the things you can do. If you're a Star Wars nerd like me, imagine any ship from Star Wars (the millienium falcon, the jedi starfighter, the y-wing, the x-wing) and relize that you can build all of them. If you like Star Trek, relize that you could build a replica of the Enterprise. Or, if you're that guy who wants to know what it's like to live in space, then survival is for you. Now, if you're the guy who doesn't know how to learn the controls by his or herself, then you can go to the very helpful Space Engineers website that has their own tutorial videos.(Trust me, you'll need them)\nIf you're the guy who likes to build stuff and then blow the ♥♥♥♥ out of it, then this is your game.\n\nAll in all, this game is really fun, just don't expect it to be fun every moment you're playing, because it does require time and effort to make something worth while. But don't ever give up on something, because it's totally worth it in the end.","October 7, 2014","true","282.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This alpha phase game currently packs more features that most full games I have. It is truely unique and gives me a lot of hope. The developers are AMAZING and there are already a lot of youtube channels with how to guides on how to play. IT IS NOT YET FULLY FUNCTIONAL, but it is really close. The weapons on small ships and the automatic rifle and drills work. The best part, they just added multiplayer up to 16 people. it's still rough, but holy crap is it awesome. The graphics are really good and the building is really easy once you get into it. The only limit is your imagination. The physics of this game are as real as they can get without you needing to be an expert on space physics to play. There are a lot of things in this game to tickle your fancy. If I cannot convince you, look up Bradphusion on youtube and watch one or two of his videos. this game will keep me busy for years to come. Look out minecraft.\n\nREVIEW UPDATE 3/18/14\nIt happened. KSH added the survival update. It is still a little raw and the implimetation of survival somehow messed up creative for some of my friends, but this game is getting better and better. I already play this way more than any of my other games. My recommendation is to get this game while it's still only $14.99. The devs have announced that they are going back to weekly updates. This game is just amazing.\n\nREVIEW UPDATE 5/9/14\nIt's been some time since I've updated this review.\nThe game is still going in a good direction. I am happy with every update as it nears completion.\n\nCons: It can still be laggy on multiplayer, but they are optamizing it with every update\nThe worlds are not yet unlimited, but there is enough to keep you busy for a really long time.\nSadly the public multiplayer does have greifers, but every game has griefers.\n\nREVIEW UPDATE 12/11/2014\nBeen a while since I have updated this review.\nBut my recommendation stands. This game has only gotten better since the last review update.\nThat being said, with almost 300 hours into this game, its flaws have started to show themselves to me.\n\nPros:\n\n*You can build anything. The only limit is your imagination. 10/10 for freedom\n\n*Amazing mod support. There are mods to turn this game into anything you want. If you just want to build in creative for hours at a time, there are mods to enhance that. Want to have large scale fleet battles with your friends? Mods for weapons and combat blocks are also available. 10/10 for the mod community.\n\n*Amazing community. To many people, the fanbase of a game is enough to make or break a game. I am one of those people. No one should ever be afraid to voice a complaint, suggestion or question on a game forum. But so many communities have immature bullies that would rather make you feel bad for having a individual thought than welcome you and help you. This game has an outstanding community with groups for just about any aspect of the game. I used to be in charge of one of the first groups (MEC Enterprises) before life got in the way. There are groups for combat, piracy, building, survival, and even salvaging. Anyone can fit in in this game, and if you don't find something for you, make a group and post it to the hub. People would love to join you. 10/10 for the community.\n\n*Developers. The dev team is fantastic. I have never seen a better team. They actually listen to the community. We the players have as much of a voice in the creation of this game as they do. If a mod is popular enough, they add it to the vanilla version of the game. They have teamed up with a 3D printing company and when you build a ship, they can make a real life model and send it to you. They update every week. They have quality merchandise on their website and in general, they are just great. 10/10 for Developers. Keep up the great work guys.\n\n*Game Play. The game play is great. For zero gravity, the controls are very easy to grasp. switching from ZeroG to a gravity influenced area is without error. Gun play is pretty bad, but it's not a major part or the game and thus not a high priority. Ship weapons and fighter combat on the other hand are amazing yet challenging. Combat in ZeroG is a whole new beast and it doesn't help the fact that you don't know what you are about to get into a dogfight with because they built it. It's both exciting and a new challenge. Building is amazing. If you thought minecraft had building down to a T, this game will blow you away. There are just so many features to building paired with being able to rotate yourself to get a better angle. One of their updates added a projector block, so you can build a ship in creative and then save it as a blueprint, and then you can transfer it over to a survival world where the projector sets up a hologram for you to follow when building the ship. Gameplay 9.7/10 (They had to lose some points for the gunplay).\n\nCons:\n\n*AI. This is a frequent issue from the community. There is no danger in this game. In minecraft, you have mobs. The worst you get in this game is drifting ships with guns and meteor showers. The lack of danger is my biggest issue. The only reason I want to play survival is because I want to see if I can survive. For a uncharted asteroid belt in outer space, there are surprisingly few threats to challenge you. The only thing that I felt challenged was my patience. The best you can do right now is try to find a PvP server or set something up with friends. That being said, the devs may be planning something so we will wait and see. There is also a way to script basic AI, so I imagine there is something to be found in the steam workshop for download.\n\n*Limitations. While the world can be set to unlimited, there is no procedural generation. You spawn in an asteroid cluster and the asteroids you see are the only ones around you. You can keep going but you will find nothing. There is nothing to explore. **This being said, there was a blog post from the head of the development team earlier this week saying that they will not only add procedural asteroid generation, but they also plan to add direlect ships and stations for you to explore. They will be using designs from the community for the most part.\n\n*Survival. I have no issue with creative, but for me, survival got boring after about 3-4 hours and I went back to dumping a couple hundred hours into creative.\n\nOverall I do not recommend buying this game solely for survival mode, but I recommend it for creative and the community, and to be a part of the creation of the best voxel game I have ever seen.\n\nTL;DR Buy this game.","January 27, 2014","true","283.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
