Labcoat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LtLabcoat/","1680 products in account","Alright, here's my comprehensive guide on how to beat this game:\n\nStep 1: Select the "How to play" button.\n\nStep 1a: This is the first trap, as you actually have to toggle Windowed Mode first. It won't actually change to windowed mode until you restart, but it'll make the game actually play. Otherwise, selecting the "How to play" button will freeze the game.\n\nStep 1b: also, have both your keyboard and mouse prepared, as the menus use different conrols.\n\nStep 2: Beat the "How to play" level. This requires a bit of guesswork, as this level does not actually tell you the controls.\n\nStep 3: Start the game. Remember, your goal is to collect the coins.\n\nStep 4: Die a pathethic death, because the controls are janky as all hell.\n\nStep 5: Uninstall the game.\n\nCONGRADULATIONS, you have now gotten the good ending: quitting the game before you waste any more time trying to play it properly.","June 1, 2015","false","0.1"," 33 of 38 people (87%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","87","33","38","16","0"

I, for one, even experienced brief flashes of enjoyment from conquering particularly difficult levels. I could have forgiven the brutal level design. I could have forgiven Game Gear graphics. I could have forgiven minor glitchiness. I could have forgiven public domain music from Grandma's mahjong tablet apps. But I can't forgive clearing 12 tough as nails levels only to die on the first boss and be sent all the way back to Stage 1-1. This might be the single most artificially difficult and insulting thing a developer has ever done to make money on Steam and run. I would not recommend this game if it were free.","September 24, 2015","false","6.3"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","14","16","0","2"

(space to jump, space again to shoot grappling hook, arrows for movement) then it opens a portal, again figure out how to go through it, because the game doesn't say.\n\noh and i forgot to mention, it went full screen again as soon as you play, so windowed mode only means for the menu i guess?\n\nso i go to play the first level. fairly basic platforming style level. i died abut 6 times on level 1. hidden surprise traps, and the sprite for your character and the sprites for the traps are actually larger than the pixels of those things. so you have to have quite a buffer away from the dangers or you'll instantly die, restart level. after restarting level 1 6 times, i got through it. level 2. i died...i don't know how many times, until I gave up.\n\nit's not that the levels are designed in such a way as to be entirely unfair, except sometimes it's clearly made to be particularly difficult, but the controls are so wonky. and combine that with the buffer zone i mentioned, makes it more difficult than it needs to be.\n\nthe artwork is mediocre. not horrible, i've seen worse. same can be said for the music. meh.\n\nabout the only thing I had fun with was getting a good circular spin going with the grappling hook. you can really get going fast!\n\nif I were to rate all the games i've played (I have over 550 and played around 25% of them to some degree), this one is...at least better than GearCrank Arena. But I don't think ive played one worse than this otherwise.\n\nEDIT: I played some more and realized that you can go up and down on the grappling hook, so glad i didn't learn that in the non-tutorial. ♥♥♥♥ you level 4. I ended up giving up and realizing my time was worth more than this game on level 6. Saw other reviews say that if you die on the first boss you go all the way back to 1-1, so again, ♥♥♥♥ the devs on that. stupid ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.","September 25, 2015","false","4.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I could talk about what the game is lacking. I could talk about how the design is a cookie cutter of any number of games. Instead I will talk about a lazy developer, and an even more putrid publisher. The game itself was specifically designed to be as little work as possible so that a publishing company can generate as much profit as they can.\n\nThis game looks and plays like it was a first game by a developer ever. The price of $10 American is a joke at best. I for one will be flagging this game on steam to have it removed due to fraudulent practices involving steam cards. Which is a down right lie for the exe does not even have the support libraries with it to even have steam cards.\n\nDont buy this game.","June 2, 2015","false","0.1"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","0"

I felt like I was skating around on ice when I was controling the guy.

And I'd like to be fair on my thoughts about the game.\n\nThe problem for me is I don't possess the naturally ability to play platformers. I lack the required dexterity, patience and sometimes interest to keep at it.\nThe game itself is fairly simple - walk, jump and a double jump activates a ninja 'hook' which you MUST use to pass obstacles, traps and obtain coins.\nI think I scored this game in a bundle, as I don't think I would have willingly purchased it - not because it's bad, because I suck at platformers.\n\nSo the positives for me are cards and achievements (but I can't seem to get past the first level!), so the achievements are largely pointless - maybe one of my kids can have a go on my behalf :)\n\nLook, if you like platformers buy it on special - otherwise stay away.\n\n7/10 (if you ignore my sucking at platforming)","September 8, 2015","true","2.1"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"
