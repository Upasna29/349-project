Trees in tidy rows along the boulevards, everyone driving at a perfectly reasonable pace, not a single building run down or in disarray. "This'll be just the place to live out my autumn years in peace."\n\nAnd so he did. For a time.\n\nJust as he was finally getting in with the local bridge club, something... changed. It was small at first; a can of soda unexpectedly expelled from a vending machine, or a set of bollards popping up in the middle of the road at entirely the wrong time of day. "Never mind that; I'm sure the good folks on town council will sort that out lickety split."\n\nIt was then that he realized his car (a practical sedan) wasn't where he'd remembered parking it. "Hm, must have been back the other way. Silly of me." As he turned around, making a note to himself to read up on the effects of aging on memory, he spotted his car. It was higher up in the air than he tended to park it, and presently in the process of crashing through a third floor office suite. Glass and mortar rained down on the ground below, followed shortly by the sickening crunch of his car slamming face-first into the pavement.\n\nAnd then it exploded.\n\nAnd then all hell broke loose.","January 25","true","2.7"," 58 of 69 people (84%) found this review helpful 88 people found this review funny","84","58","69","88","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/389220/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2818 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nMaximum Override is an early access casual action game, being developed by Alientrap, who have brought us such games as Capsized in the past. The game was released in January 2016 on the early access platform. Since then the game has not had any update, the last being January 30th.\n\nThe game’s concept is really good.  You are in a top down view, and you select objects to take control of, this can be cars, monster trucks, fire hydrants, vending machines, and many many more.  When playing through the regular mode of the game, you have tasks to kill a certain amount of targets in an allotted amount of time. The actual objective is not difficult, where the game falls down is the controls. On the main menu screen, there is a big box that says “Controller is recommended” with a picture of the Xbox controller, so you’d instantly think the game was 100% compatible with that hardware. Wrong. The control just does not work, I initially thought it was my hardware being the issue, so I plugged in another control, and the same thing. I looked past this since it is early access and started playing with keyboard/mouse; but still I had problems. There is a huge amount of input lag on anything you do throughout gameplay making it unplayable sometimes.  One of Maximum Override’s redeeming features is the physics engine; driving through walls and buildings is so satisfying that it just collapses the way you’d expect it to. Granted this makes the frame rate absolutely tank into the single figures, so some optimization is clearly needed.\n\nMaximum Override’s visual look is simple yet appealing. It does have the blocky look to it that a lot of games are starting to produce nowadays, but this style is very pleasing. It reminds me a lot of a Lego style, rather than the drab Minecraft style.  Sound effects are nothing special, just your run of the mill generic sounds; maybe a little work to be done on that subject.\n\nThis game is challenging, but not through the game’s challenges itself, purely down to the controller issues – that is the thing that holds you back with progression most of the time. You spend so much time trying to get your car going in the right direction rather than actually traveling to your next target. I mean, it took me just over two hours to complete the first three stages.  Normally for an early access title, two hours’ worth of content is quite good, but if it had not been for the controller problems there would of only been about an hours’ worth on show in Maximum Override. There is a sort of sandbox mode for you to just mess around in and break stuff, but we need much more than that to make this develop into a game worthy of a place in our libraries.\n\nI covered the majority of the technical problems above, but they are really game hindrances that need to be addressed asap. The controls issue being of upmost importance. Next up should clearly be adding more content; there just isn’t enough for people to sink their teeth into right now. The concept of the game is really good like I said; and I would love to see more of the same. I really hope this game hasn’t been abandoned, and given the lack of any updates in almost three months, that likelihood is becoming more and more of a possibility. I am going to give this game a thumbs up for now and revisit the game in a few weeks’ time when there will hopefully be a new patch.\n\nTom's Early Access Score Card\n1) Stay away, abandoned project\n2) Not recommended, generally bad game\n3) Purchase with caution\n4) Potentially good game\n5) Worthy of purchase even in current state\n6) Highly recommended\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

Except in this game, you get to play as the machines taking over the world. The gameplay is fun, and very satisfying. The visuals are nice. They are somewhat akin to that of Katamari Damacy. As of right now, there are only 3 modes, all of which have different goals (Did not get to play the Sandbox Mode when I tried the game, but it's basically like the other modes, just with no goal). In arcade mode, you try to destroy as much as possible, to score as high as possible within 3 minutes. In Gman elimination mode, you must destroy a certain number of MIB (Men In Black) before the time runs out. Overall, the game was fun, and should get better with more refining whilst in early access. The only gripe I have with the game, is that the controls feel a little strange, mainly when operating the camera when you aren't in a vehicle, and are searching for one to control on the map. Overall though, i would recommend this game :)\n\nIf you're interested, i made a video on the game, which i've put below.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGQBtQ-57vQ","January 25","true","0.6"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","0"

If you're a kid this will probably appeal big time to you (minus the gore/blood that comes from hurting people). It's not a bad game and a slightly demanding price but as I said, if breaking things appeals to you, this may be for you. Remember though, this game is still in early access as currently there are three maps! I would highly recommend doing your homework before purchasing. As of now, the game only has two playable levels.\n\nI can't help but to think of the game Demolition Inc. The biggest difference is that you are not limited in your moves and this is not a puzzle game. Literally almost anything can be destroyed. So far running over cars with a tank or trying to make certain objects explode are slightly awkward but for the most part it works. The gameplay of this game is decent at best for the moment. The controls are a little stiff as well as the camera controls. This is sheer destruction or objectively driven. In destruction mode, you simply destroy as much as you can to acquire as many points as you can. This may be the preferred mode for most players. In objective mode, the player must kill certain citizens (gmen). You also have a time limit to complete this objective. The last game mode is Zen where you can simply break anything you want without any timers or objectives. Some of the destruction is a bit awkward as well. There will be buildings that look like they should collapse with 3 walls gone, but they don't. This may be an aspect that needs some work.\n\nThe unique aspect of this game is that there are certain objects the player is able to take control of. Some of these objects include cars, special cars, a giant rolling globe, a monster truck, vending machines, a crane with a destruction ball (although the cord goes through some buildings), fire hydrants, helicopters, military helicopters with the ability to fire an unlimited amount of missiles, a tank, a mech and a UFO. The mech and the UFO are sort of "hidden" under a dome. To unlock these special objects, the player is required to destroy the locking mechanisms that surround the dome. These locking mechanisms are fairly easy to break but it takes away from the time you have left! Helicopters are quite difficult to fly (as in it's awkward keeping them in the air and pointing to where you want to point/go). The car controls are decent, nothing over the top. There isn't a hand break feature or horn and acceleration tops out quickly. The player may shoot with the tank but the blast radius isn't significant.\n\nThe visuals are at best decent and sort of resemble a mind craft graphic except it's smoother. There are some nice demolition effects but sometimes it can be questionable (a building standing on one leg). The sounds are decent and are at best average. Wouldn't be a bad idea to add some diversity here.\n\nOverall, I appreciate the dev putting in special vehicles such as the mech and UFO. I would like to see development in this area in regards to including more obscene and crazy controllable objects. Also, don't be afraid to play with the scenery too. Add some boulders out on the mountains, trees that can fall, maybe even the ability to control the weather? There is a lot that can be added to a lot more depth in the game. I would say highly consider adding new game modes. Changing the rules of the game can increase interest! Destroy only this, break these buildings down but not these ones, destroy as many "X" as you can, defend so and so from the military. You can even throw in a sumo mode and maybe even develop the multiplayer aspect of the game (break more than the opponent)? Definitely keep adding maps as well! Also, please add an option for the gore! More maps are definitely needed and try to diversify the landscape (maybe even make that break-able... land slide maybe)? Also, keep adding objects be it vehicles or stuff you see walking along the street. The more you add here, the more bang for our buck we'll get.\n\n\nEARLY ACCESS RATING : 6.35/10\n\n\nScreenShots :\nThere is...\n\na\n\nstory\n\nto\n\nthis","April 3","true","1.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","5","6","2","0"

Yes, I know this recommends a minimum of above integrated, but most games do and I can still play them fine. I'm just giving everyone a heads up that they're still very early alpha and optimization has not been a priority yet. It's crashed my card 3 times.\nLike I said though, my card is below recommended, so you can't really blame them.\n\nAs for the game... I think it's a $6 game. It's fun to pick it up and level cities, but you get bored easily, and as the game is at this stage of Early Access, there's almost no content. You have two non-randomized cities, three modes each. So right now, $5-$6 is the right price. If, and only if, they add more content will it be worth more than that, but $6 is pushing its current value.","January 29","true","1.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I always like games where you can destroy stuff, and this one is exactly my perfect vision of such a game.  Buildings break and pieces bend beautifully. When I want to destroy a city or something, my main goal is to destroy ALL of it, and to my knowledge this is the only game that lets you destroy EVERY BIT of everything. Love it! And some designs for destruction, such as the vending machine, are very unique and creative. I have only one complaint: the people look too cute. Every time I kill someone I feel kinda bad for doing it, which is not a feeling I commonly get with playing other games. Anyway, it's a wonderful thing!

I received a copy for free, but still didn't see the value in the game after putting so much time in.\n\nFull Video Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnZZcyHnk0w\n\nEDIT/UPDATE:\n\nThe developer found my review and wrote me. He seemed to be upset that I gave an honest review. He thinks that for $6.99, there is plenty of content. I provide free reviews for developers, that are HONEST, and apparently the developer doesn't like my opinion. For that reason, I thought I'd share this as well as expand my review to state why I am not recommending it.\n\nGameplay: This is fun, but only gave me about 30 mins of enjoyment. Any other time spent in game was to have a better stance on reviewing the game. After 30 mins or so, the gameplay is extremely repetitive. There are two game modes, smash as much as you can or take out the "G-Men." While interesting as side minigames, there is nothing else to hold your attention. I completed all 3 achievements for the game in under 30 minutes and there are only 2 levels, so there isn't much calling me back to it.\n\nPerformance/Graphics: While the game has decent graphics and an interesting style for an indie game at this price point, the game runs choppy as all hell. I have a very high-end PC and this game had frame-rate stutter VERY often (seen in my video review as well).\n\nAudio: The one, maybe two audio tracks loop continuosly, and while they are okay at best, they are a bit annoying after playing for awhile as its the same track over and over.\n\nOverall: For $6, you are not getting much content. There are PLENTY of games on steam for less than $10 that provide more, and plenty of indie games at that. For these reasons, I do not recommend the game in the current state.","February 7","false","10.1"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","9","17","0","0"

I noticed this the most with the Mech.  You'll be looking at some G-man behind you, and accelerate, only for the camera will be lynched to face forward of your selected vehicle.\n*Helicopters are nigh impossible and has a learning curve worse than any Battlefield copter to pilot, almost seeming like a waste of time.\n*Sometimes buildings fall over.  Sometimes you have anti-gravity bricks where a top half refuses to fall despite all support being demolished.\n*The boundry for you to lose possession of vehicles/other things is bizzare.  If you go too high, your vehicle of choice just ejects you without warning.\n*The Monster Truck and Motorcycle aren't very stable.  They feel awkward to control, and that's because you use the same stick to roll and pitch as well as steer.\n*The Gravity Gun can fire off your selected projectile way too fast if you hold the fire button for too long.  You really gotta tap the button or your just going to slam (and jam) your projectile.","February 12","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
