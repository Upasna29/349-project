I have been playing this game for about a month now on one of its official servers and have been severely let down.  Don't get me wrong, it is a fun game, but when you put in tons of hours developing your base and taking down other nations, only to be targeted by the developers/server people because you took out a nation of one of their friends.\n\nI am usually a quiet player who won't chat much while building for hours on end.  Our nation started with about 3 members and now has about 8, with only 3 of us who play on a daily basis.  The others log on occasionally every few days or so.  The main nation on the server was named Endless Souls who was the server powerhouse.  It was obvious from the global chat that the developer and server admins were very friendly with the members of Endless Souls.  We spent many hours building up our defenses so our nation could not be overrun.\n\nThe only way for a nation to be lost is to have your nation beacon taken out.  In order to prevent this, you build around it to either straight up protect it or to disguise it into the surrounding terrain to make it difficult it find.\n\nNot long after our nations defenses were built up, we got attacked for about 3 days straight by the Endless Souls.  They were never able to get through our defenses.  With our nation beacon built into the terrain, the few ships that were able to get past our initial defenses were unsure of where to go to take out our nation beacon.  The day after their last massive attempted invasion, I witnessed the games official server admin, "siroro", tell members of the Endless Souls nation where our nation beacon was located.  He did this in global chat.\n\nDuring that attempted massive invasion, I witnessed one member of the Endless Souls jump into our area with a ship made to look like a ♥♥♥♥♥.  That member then proceeding to state in global chat, something to the extent, "i just rammed Aracdia in the a**."\n\nTrash talk has been present in this game since the very first day I played it.  I have witnessed many players trash talk on the global chat on a daily basis.  Never once did I see anyone be punished for it, until we started to become the server's powerhouse nation.  This is when I started to become more vocal in the global chats, questioning why some people were being punished for things that other players had been doing since the first day I started playing.  The problem was, that those people who were still trash talking and not being punished for it were friends of the developer and server admins.  I remind you that this was all taking place on one of the games official servers.\n\nAnother feature in this game, is the ability to leave signs.  From the very first day, I have seen profanity laced signs on various maps throughout the server.  I, again, never heard one peep from anyone about these signs until members of our nation started leaving them.  One thing I should mention is that at the time, the developer and server admin publically stated that profanity was OK to use in global chat.  Again, certain members of our nation began to be punished for using profanity when we became the server's powerhouse nation, overtaking the nations of the developers and server admins friends.\n\nWhen we were finally able to topple the Endless Souls nation and become the main nation on one of the games' official servers, the admin on the games official community server made a former member of the Endless Souls, a chat moderator.  Since Sslazz (sp?) has become moderator, he has threatened and even actually muted members of our nation for no reason at all.  I will admit, I was muted earlier today by Sslazz for trying to get an answer as to why the leader our nation was banned from the game (I will address this later).  At no point in time did I harrass or use profanity towards any of the admins.  All I was doing was asking questions, some of which were not being answered and others were being answered with so called violations that never existed before for their buddies.\n\nThe reason that being muted is important, is that you are unable to communicate with other players who you may be working with.  Sometimes while trying to take out another nation, you will work with other players who are not members of your nation.  The only way to do this is through global chat.\n\nNow for the part about our leader being banned.  To start I will go back a few days when we took out a certain someone's nation.  I won't deny it, our leader was always present in the global chat.  Yes, I felt that he took it too far on occasions, but I have seen other players (favorites of the developer/server admins) go just as far, and even further without being punished.  That was one reason stated as to why he got banned.\n\nThe second reason, was that he created a ship that resembled a ♥♥♥♥♥.  Yes, he did do this, but the idea was present in this game since I first saw one used when the Endless Souls attacked us.  Nothing was said then, when they used it.  When I presented that counter claim to the server admin, he then changed his story to "well he brought it to spawn".  I asked him where it stated you couldn't bring certain ships to spawn and he said it was on one of the signs.  I proceeded to go to spawn after he said this and could not find a sign stating that.  After I brought this to his attention, he then said that he told him in a whisper chat (message can only be seen by receiving party).  So certain players have certain rules while others do not?  I have seen other ♥♥♥♥♥ shaped ships at spawn before and nothings happened.\n\nI believe the third reason the server admin gave for the ban was the signs he was leaving after we toppled a nation.  I have seen profanity used in global chat before, to which the server admin/developer said was fine.  I have also seen signs with profanity used before by other players (buddies of the admin/developers), and nothing has happened to them.\n\nThe reason that banning people hurts your nation, especially in a nation of a few people, is that your nations defenses are the copper missile pods.  The copper missle pods are run by dispersion generators which produce a waste (waste that can in turn be used for fuel in mass generators).  The collection tanks for the dispersion generators can only be a max of 512 spaces.  Once they fill up (it takes a while to clean the waste out), the dispersion generator stops working and the missile pods also stop working.  This makes your nation defenseless and open for the taking.\n\nI honestly don't know if this ban is the developer/admin's idea of how to take down our nation.  We have spent hundreds of hours building up our nation, only for the developer/advmin to make us vulnerable because we toppled his buddies nations.\n\nLastly, after our leader got banned today, the developer, the official server admin, and the chat moderator were all laughing about the ban in global chat.  If you want to put tons of time into the game only for your nation to be taken down by the developer and his official server admin, buy it.  If not, please look elsewhere for a game.","November 12, 2014","false","296.5"," 139 of 197 people (71%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","71","139","197","8","20"

My opinion here is based from what I have experienced both as a player and seen as a server admin.\n\nIf you enjoy building things the beauty of SN is that you can make anything you want and pilot it versus something that is stationary on land. The Demo is quite giving if you feel the price is too steep for Early Access so if nothing else you can give it a try for free.\n\nNew content and mechanics are always being added, revised or even removed based on what the community has shared with the developer. If you want to complain but never post or email your input you can't expect to see any change. So that is something to consider at this stage in its development.\n\nThe developer MrBenjammin is very active in the community and has even been seen hunting the Magmasite Queen and logging on when people ask him to come check something they built out. When I was new to SN he would visit my claimed sector and check out the latest builds and just have casual conversation about building and game mechanics or what he was hoping to do next. It was pretty cool to learn straight from him and why I put the steam guide together to share the knowledge. I've always thought it was pretty fantastic to see a developer in his own game checking out what others have accomplished. I can honestly say he loves seeing what the community comes up with.","June 22, 2015","true","653.1"," 28 of 33 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","28","33","2","0"

You mine stuff (sometimes with laser weapons) and use them to build your ships.\n\nYou can set up a nation for your friends, keep a capitol where only your nation members can go. You can wage a ship war with other nations.\n\n\nI really like the whole "build ship fly around be a pirate" aspect.\n\nIts not without its problems though. Getting your first start in the game can be a bit troublesome if you dont read the hints. The game has a built in wiki to mitigate some of that though. The game can be a bit buggy sometimes, but its an early alpha so that is to be expected.\n\n\nI'd say this game is definitely worth it.

You must build a ship and set out into the world and...Do whatever you want to do...\n\nBecome a trader, mining with sophisticated vessels with lasers and trading your materials to the NPC traders or other players and their nations. Form your own nation, building a home system with missle defences and hangers to keep all your ships safe. Become a pirate and raid and scrap other peoples ship for loot and cash. Lots of possibilities.\n\nGreat fun even though its still in Alpha, many of the main features you would look for are present. The open PvP system adds alot of tension, the design for ship components means you will ideally have to cooperate and form a crew to be formidable which is cool. The biomes are unique and huge and the movement for ships is very smooth and clean unlike what I expected.","October 20, 2014","true","41.7"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","18","24","0","1"

This block builder lets you sail the sky in self designed craft of your choosing. The developer is involved with the community and has taken suggestions and critisium alike.  It is a PVP spacific game, so expect to be attacked once outside of the initial spawn zone.  That being said, there are good and bad people on all the community servers.  Some will lie to your face and knock out the brick you are standing on just to watch you die. Others will bend over backward to help you build a ship or put up a nation.   If you want to know more on the game read the message boards.  They give good insight.  It takes a bit to learn the ropes, but once you do, starting your own nation is relatively simple.  Defending it is a bit more difficult.      Biggest thing in this game is planning.  Plan on the worst and hope for the best.  No one can take anything that is in your personal inventory, so keep it stocked!. You may loose a ship or two.  You may loose a base. (i've lost the first base and at least 4 ships.)  but as long as you learn you can continue to grow and move on and build better.    A fun game.. and great for that kid inside who love building stuff.","November 23, 2014","true","991.1"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","16","23","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gm027/recommended/310760/","gm027","Goldium","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gm027/","48 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nLots of fun in this game.\n\nTo sum it up, it's as if I got my love for airships from Guns of Icarus Online, merged with the creative powers of Minecraft. The game is insanely open-world (lots of systems depending on the server), and there's always something to do. From taking your starter ship and building it up to a massive warship, to fighting off against the Magmasite Queen, you'll be hard-pressed to find yourself bored of this game.\n\nThe freedom you have in this game is only limited to your imagination for the most part (and what resources you have on hand). The only downside you'll see from this game is the lack of server availabilty (last I checked there's only 3 community servers, and rarely a private server or two hanging around), the small playerbase (which is unfortunate), and the maximum limit of your shipbuilding. Sky Nations lets you build your ships in a 32x32x32 space, which, while it is still plentiful to have (and believe me, I built a ship 32 blocks long), you might find yourself still shorthanded if you like to build big ships (like replicas of the Enterprise or a Star Destroyer). Of course though, the latter is my own opinion, based off the near 85 hours I put into this game.\n\nIf you want to build ships or structures of your own design, build up an HQ for your clan (or "Nation" as they are called), or have a hearty crew to fly around with, firing off your arsenal of cannons and turrets either at players or a massive beast, this is definitely the game for you.\n\nPersonal Note: I bought this game out of my love for two seperate games, being combined into one. Odds are if you love Guns of Icarus Online, or Minecraft, you would love having this game in your Steam library. The community is so very friendly, while small, still friendly. The developer himself even hops on the servers occasionally to check out other people's creations and play alongside other players. I played this game with some friends before, and we had a blast flying ships, building our own ships, and even fighting off a Magmasite Queen in one of them. If you want to see this game with a bigger playerbase, buy the game and be apart of it for starters. The servers are fairly decent if you are worried of lagging much, and you can pretty well customize how you look, what you're flying, and how your Nation's capital looks. I fully recommend this game if you want to fly your own personalized airship, and explore the open-world of flying mountains, islands, glaciers, and other lands with ancient secrets waiting to be uncovered.","August 9, 2015","true","213.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

I'm proud to say that I am a part of its community that it is steering the game in its current direction.\n\nSky Nations, like many voxel games, it most likely a success because of its huge degree of freedom. It is the canvas on which a pilot's creativity comes to life. Do want to build a small sleek ship? Or do you want to be like me, and design a ship that is literally a moving house?\n\nOf course, you don't need to be a creative genius to have fun in the game. The game has always been advertised with a piracy aspect, and its something that is immensely thrilling. The ability to board a ship, dispose of its occupants, and fly away with your new prize is incredibly satisfying.\n\nThe lead developer, Mr Benjammin, has recently implemented a Capitols system. No longer do you need to worry about logging off and having your ship stolen. Just park it in your capitol and it'll be there when you come back. Then you can resume your pirate adventures in your shiny ship.\n\nBut what fun is flying in a ship by yourself? Join a nation (or make your own) and fly the skies as an unstoppable pirate fleet! Friendship and teamwork are a huge part of what keeps this game interesting for me, and the frequent updates ensure that the game stays fresh.\n\nSo, in conclusion:\n\n+Wide degree of freedom\n+Loads of fun with friends and enemies alike\n+Arrr, pirates!\n+A small but loyal community that continues to grow\n+One of the most friendly and responsive developers I've ever met\n+Great moderator team\n+It's not finished yet\n-It's not finished yet\n-Needs more cats\n\nGGG for life!","February 24, 2015","true","232.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","1"

Create a ship made of iron, build up a nation from nothing, maybe recruit a friend.\n\nWith the vast amount of voxel games that have popped up in the last year or two, this one feels the most distinct to me. Unfortunately, it also feels like the most unappreciated one as well. Yes, it does need some polishing regarding aesthetics and bugs, but that isn't really important at this stage, considering it's early access. Also, I should mention, while other Early access games are rated positive for their potential (which much of the time goes unfulfilled) I'm rating this one for what it is  now,  that being a fantastic game.\n\nMost of the negative reviews for this game are regarding the game population. On all servers combined, there aren't many players, true. But seriously, that's the worst excuse I've heard not to buy this game. First of all, if you actually stuck with the game, hey, you know what? You'd increase the playerbase! These people are actually creating their own problem with the game. Second, to enjoy this game, you don't really need to have many people on. Trust me, even if there is a low playerbase, you will run into other people. And they'll likely be pirates, so try to keep your shotgun handy at all times.\n\nLastly, the Dev is awesome. He adds new content fairly often, chats with people in-game, and listens to community suggestions. Really friendly and chill dude. So basically, buy this game if you like building, pirating, shotguns, lasers, (did I mention that there are lasers?) and giant floating machine spheres left by the ancients. Yup.\n\nOh, and there's exploding jellyfish.","March 1, 2015","true","208.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Sometimes, I'll log on, ignore all the things that need to be done to my nation, and I'll just go out and explore. Sky Nations is an ever-changing world, both in-game and update-wise, so there's always something new to see.\n\nThat being said, the biggest draw to the game for me is the constant progression. It's a small game, so it's not difficult to start out, but there's a very long way to go before you can really become a powerful force on a server. Despite that, almost every single time I play, i feel like I'm achieving something new. Even the smallest thing, like building a public bathroom in my capital, will satisfy me. In this way, Sky Nations keeps on pulling me back in.\n\nThere are flaws. Plenty of them. It feels like I discover a new bug every 2 weeks. But the dev is always there to help smooth things through, and if not him, one of the myriad of compassionate admins.\nA very important thing to remember is that Sky Nations is not only in early-access, but is also being made by one guy. It's obviously not going to be very polished. But despite that, I still prefer playing Sky Nations to a lot of other games in my (admittedly not extensive) library. That's because what Sky Nations has right now is already better than half the games on steam right now.\n\nVoxel games and first person games are absolutely not my forte. I'm sure that's the case for many of the people considering buying this game. But I see absolutely no reason for someone on the fence about buying this to not get it. It's got great community, a great dev, very good gameplay, it's even better with friends, and it's got flying cats.\n\n","March 14, 2015","true","197.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

I would deffinetly say to you, "Only buy it if you are looking for a fun, layed back kinda game." This is only because of the nature of the game. The game costs alot of money but is a heck of fun to play. You create your ship, You battle other players and you upgrade said ship. This can all be done with a matter of machines, Blocks and tools.\n\nThe blocks in the game are standard. Things like stone, wood and dirt. But the way you can use these are much bigger than your conventional sandbox game (I'm lookin' at you Minecraft) You can build your base ontop of a giant pill shaped island. You can mine out Molton Rock to power your Mass Generators (More on that in a bit.) You can use copper to create repeaters to gun down other ships. Iron to make cannons to take out larger ships. This list goes on and this is only the start.\n\nWhen you get into the machinery such as the Mass Generator or the Energy Storage Unit you get into the advanced Burntout Cores. These cores can be gotten either by buying them from the Merchant Cat (More on him later) or taken from the machine planet. The machine planet is a giant planet made of indistructium, an indistrucatble alloy, with different floors and holes in the side for entering. Burntout cores are the basis for all major machinery such as the Mass Generator which makes your ship create more energy per second which can help you with more thrusters and thus more speed.\n\nThe tools aren't very unique with a mix of Guns of Icarus and Minecraft. You have a mallet for breaking things. Then you have tools such as a hammer, a wrench and a fire extinguisher for fixing items. Then you have an electric prod as a melee weapon. Then you have to build a shotgun as a major line of defense. I still find these items unique in a way because they bring their own style to the game.\n\nFinally, everything else. The islands are unique having their own ways of showing. Such as a molten rock planet that you can gain your items for your mass generator. A giant pill shaped island that can be used too create a large base. Normal islands that contain trees on the top and sand on the bottom. The list is endless. But there is one thing in the middle of all of this that everyone loves and often dispise. The Merchant Cat. This cat flys around the different sectors of the world selling goods of all kinds. He is the bane of everyones existance because he gives a warning of getting off his ship within on eminute and can take you off with him to the next sector. But everyone loves him because... Ya know... He's a freeking cat. He sells all kinds of goods. You just need to catch him on a good time. He even buys goods for copper coins so you can buy his goods.\n\nOverall this game is brilliant but if you are looking for a serious game and not a fun layed back one stay away from this. I don't want you soiling it... Goodday players and have a good one.","August 2, 2014","true","15.0"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

The game manages to take the cube look of Minecraft (and other voxel games) yet create an experience unlike any other. My initial impressions of the game would that it would be like a mod for Minecraft, a mining game with airships tacked on. Oh how wrong I was.\n\nIt has a fantastic way of balancing the time spent flying and mining, and a visible effort has been put into making the airships run smoothly. Whilst there is plenty of room to add more tools and block types, the current set works amazingly and I can see it forming a solid foundation for expansion. For anyone reading this who doesn't have the game, I can't stress enough how much it isn't like Minecraft. Visually, yes but in terms of gameplay very different.\n\nThe only criticisms I could make would involve cleaning up the engine a bit. This game doesn't run as well as similar games on the same hardware and since my last play I was unable to change the render distance.\n\nI would recommend purchasing the Alpha, as I can see this game becoming so much more awesome than it already is. Definitely worth the money and a play."\n\n\nNow this was a review of the game a year ago, when it was in a far more unstable, unbalanced, unoptimized state.\nKudos to you MrBenjamin, you've made a damn fine game and it was an honour talking to you when it was first released. It's fantastic seeing this game flying high (hehe...airships) and getting the praise it deserves.\n\nA fantastic game to play with friends, there's nothing like exploring a floating land and building an airship to your custom design.\n\n10/10 I would reccommend","September 19, 2014","true","4.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Airships, bases, housing, etc...\n\nHowever. the game's community Ruins a lot of that. Initial spawn areas are littered with incomplete ships left by people who don't bother to read the hints/tutorials. If you're good enough to get a ship going though, don't fly too close, 'cause griefers and trolls will literally steal your ship out from under you by breaking the block you're standing on and letting you fall to your doom while they try to make off with your ship. Luckily you don't lose inventory on death, so that's a little bit of frustration mitigation.\nNations (guilds, essentially) eem to be led by folks who are so leery of potential trolls and griefers being brought in, that most team up requests go ignored. I asked the same person 3 times, and got no response, while they explained to another person who'd asked once they they weren't 'allowed' to let just anyone in.\n\nGameplay is simple enough, being indeed similar to minecraft, despite the "this is not a minecraft clone" arguments.

A full review will be published once Sky Nations has released. Also note that I have over 15 hours on the game and I played it when it wasn't on Steam; when it had its own launcher.\n\nConstruct Airships and wage war in a sandbox world populated by floating islands, sprawling skies and adventure. Ride on ships and build them while your motley drive you forward, toward exploration. Persistent player servers and much more await! Sky Nations is available on Steam and is being developed and published by Damaged, which as far as I know, is a one-man developing team.\n\nI am going to start off by talking about the graphics because they are part of the reason why the game works so well. Yes; it's another voxel game. But that doesn't stop it from being creative on what it aims to be. There are new textures and new blocks such as laser blocks, engines, and a lot more. The textures feel fresh and not just thrown in there to be there. This allows players to have a sort of relaxed feeling as they are riding on their self-made space ships, looking at the "scenery".\n\nAn awesome part to the game is how easily players can get going on their space ship. It also provides for a fun experience with easily being able to get minerals, add defense to your ship, and join other factions. There are plenty of parts to craft for your ship, allowing for some neat customization options.\n\nI do have a few gripes with the game at its current state. One, I dislike the system of being able to steal from other people's ships. The reason I dislike this is because, as I was a new player once, newbies will play the game for a few hours, get a nice ship, probably not be invited into a nice faction, and then log off. The next day their ship will be looted and then they would have to start from square one; which I have to say is very frustrating. Although it does add a little survival aspect to it, it's definitely disappointing. Another gripe I have is with the server connection. When you want to have ship battles with other people and/or fight them 1v1 the battle will be all over the place because of the connection lag, which drops the intensity of the game to almost laughable. Lastly, this game is not very original. You can easily get some mods for Minecraft that either have the same amount of content or more than, which is disappointing.\n\nAlthough it is overall a great game, bringing some new textures and a neat voxel space system to the table, it lacks on a few key features.\n\n6.5/10\n","July 17, 2014","true","1.4"," 13 of 30 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","13","30","0","1"

I have been playing this game for about a month now on one of its official servers and have been severely let down.  Don't get me wrong, it is a fun game, but when you put in tons of hours developing your base and taking down other nations, only to be targeted by the developers/server people because you took out a nation of one of their friends.\n\nI am usually a quiet player who won't chat much while building for hours on end.  Our nation started with about 3 members and now has about 8, with only 3 of us who play on a daily basis.  The others log on occasionally every few days or so.  The main nation on the server was named Endless Souls who was the server powerhouse.  It was obvious from the global chat that the developer and server admins were very friendly with the members of Endless Souls.  We spent many hours building up our defenses so our nation could not be overrun.\n\nThe only way for a nation to be lost is to have your nation beacon taken out.  In order to prevent this, you build around it to either straight up protect it or to disguise it into the surrounding terrain to make it difficult it find.\n\nNot long after our nations defenses were built up, we got attacked for about 3 days straight by the Endless Souls.  They were never able to get through our defenses.  With our nation beacon built into the terrain, the few ships that were able to get past our initial defenses were unsure of where to go to take out our nation beacon.  The day after their last massive attempted invasion, I witnessed the games official server admin, "siroro", tell members of the Endless Souls nation where our nation beacon was located.  He did this in global chat.\n\nDuring that attempted massive invasion, I witnessed one member of the Endless Souls jump into our area with a ship made to look like a ♥♥♥♥♥.  That member then proceeding to state in global chat, something to the extent, "i just rammed Aracdia in the a**."\n\nTrash talk has been present in this game since the very first day I played it.  I have witnessed many players trash talk on the global chat on a daily basis.  Never once did I see anyone be punished for it, until we started to become the server's powerhouse nation.  This is when I started to become more vocal in the global chats, questioning why some people were being punished for things that other players had been doing since the first day I started playing.  The problem was, that those people who were still trash talking and not being punished for it were friends of the developer and server admins.  I remind you that this was all taking place on one of the games official servers.\n\nAnother feature in this game, is the ability to leave signs.  From the very first day, I have seen profanity laced signs on various maps throughout the server.  I, again, never heard one peep from anyone about these signs until members of our nation started leaving them.  One thing I should mention is that at the time, the developer and server admin publically stated that profanity was OK to use in global chat.  Again, certain members of our nation began to be punished for using profanity when we became the server's powerhouse nation, overtaking the nations of the developers and server admins friends.\n\nWhen we were finally able to topple the Endless Souls nation and become the main nation on one of the games' official servers, the admin on the games official community server made a former member of the Endless Souls, a chat moderator.  Since Sslazz (sp?) has become moderator, he has threatened and even actually muted members of our nation for no reason at all.  I will admit, I was muted earlier today by Sslazz for trying to get an answer as to why the leader our nation was banned from the game (I will address this later).  At no point in time did I harrass or use profanity towards any of the admins.  All I was doing was asking questions, some of which were not being answered and others were being answered with so called violations that never existed before for their buddies.\n\nThe reason that being muted is important, is that you are unable to communicate with other players who you may be working with.  Sometimes while trying to take out another nation, you will work with other players who are not members of your nation.  The only way to do this is through global chat.\n\nNow for the part about our leader being banned.  To start I will go back a few days when we took out a certain someone's nation.  I won't deny it, our leader was always present in the global chat.  Yes, I felt that he took it too far on occasions, but I have seen other players (favorites of the developer/server admins) go just as far, and even further without being punished.  That was one reason stated as to why he got banned.\n\nThe second reason, was that he created a ship that resembled a ♥♥♥♥♥.  Yes, he did do this, but the idea was present in this game since I first saw one used when the Endless Souls attacked us.  Nothing was said then, when they used it.  When I presented that counter claim to the server admin, he then changed his story to "well he brought it to spawn".  I asked him where it stated you couldn't bring certain ships to spawn and he said it was on one of the signs.  I proceeded to go to spawn after he said this and could not find a sign stating that.  After I brought this to his attention, he then said that he told him in a whisper chat (message can only be seen by receiving party).  So certain players have certain rules while others do not?  I have seen other ♥♥♥♥♥ shaped ships at spawn before and nothings happened.\n\nI believe the third reason the server admin gave for the ban was the signs he was leaving after we toppled a nation.  I have seen profanity used in global chat before, to which the server admin/developer said was fine.  I have also seen signs with profanity used before by other players (buddies of the admin/developers), and nothing has happened to them.\n\nThe reason that banning people hurts your nation, especially in a nation of a few people, is that your nations defenses are the copper missile pods.  The copper missle pods are run by dispersion generators which produce a waste (waste that can in turn be used for fuel in mass generators).  The collection tanks for the dispersion generators can only be a max of 512 spaces.  Once they fill up (it takes a while to clean the waste out), the dispersion generator stops working and the missile pods also stop working.  This makes your nation defenseless and open for the taking.\n\nI honestly don't know if this ban is the developer/admin's idea of how to take down our nation.  We have spent hundreds of hours building up our nation, only for the developer/advmin to make us vulnerable because we toppled his buddies nations.\n\nLastly, after our leader got banned today, the developer, the official server admin, and the chat moderator were all laughing about the ban in global chat.  If you want to put tons of time into the game only for your nation to be taken down by the developer and his official server admin, buy it.  If not, please look elsewhere for a game.","November 12, 2014","false","296.5"," 140 of 198 people (71%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","71","140","198","8","20"

My opinion here is based from what I have experienced both as a player and seen as a server admin.\n\nIf you enjoy building things the beauty of SN is that you can make anything you want and pilot it versus something that is stationary on land. The Demo is quite giving if you feel the price is too steep for Early Access so if nothing else you can give it a try for free.\n\nNew content and mechanics are always being added, revised or even removed based on what the community has shared with the developer. If you want to complain but never post or email your input you can't expect to see any change. So that is something to consider at this stage in its development.\n\nThe developer MrBenjammin is very active in the community and has even been seen hunting the Magmasite Queen and logging on when people ask him to come check something they built out. When I was new to SN he would visit my claimed sector and check out the latest builds and just have casual conversation about building and game mechanics or what he was hoping to do next. It was pretty cool to learn straight from him and why I put the steam guide together to share the knowledge. I've always thought it was pretty fantastic to see a developer in his own game checking out what others have accomplished. I can honestly say he loves seeing what the community comes up with.","June 22, 2015","true","653.1"," 28 of 33 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","28","33","2","0"

This block builder lets you sail the sky in self designed craft of your choosing. The developer is involved with the community and has taken suggestions and critisium alike.  It is a PVP spacific game, so expect to be attacked once outside of the initial spawn zone.  That being said, there are good and bad people on all the community servers.  Some will lie to your face and knock out the brick you are standing on just to watch you die. Others will bend over backward to help you build a ship or put up a nation.   If you want to know more on the game read the message boards.  They give good insight.  It takes a bit to learn the ropes, but once you do, starting your own nation is relatively simple.  Defending it is a bit more difficult.      Biggest thing in this game is planning.  Plan on the worst and hope for the best.  No one can take anything that is in your personal inventory, so keep it stocked!. You may loose a ship or two.  You may loose a base. (i've lost the first base and at least 4 ships.)  but as long as you learn you can continue to grow and move on and build better.    A fun game.. and great for that kid inside who love building stuff.","November 23, 2014","true","991.1"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","16","23","0","0"

The game is insanely open-world (lots of systems depending on the server), and there's always something to do. From taking your starter ship and building it up to a massive warship, to fighting off against the Magmasite Queen, you'll be hard-pressed to find yourself bored of this game.\n\nThe freedom you have in this game is only limited to your imagination for the most part (and what resources you have on hand). The only downside you'll see from this game is the lack of server availabilty (last I checked there's only 3 community servers, and rarely a private server or two hanging around), the small playerbase (which is unfortunate), and the maximum limit of your shipbuilding. Sky Nations lets you build your ships in a 32x32x32 space, which, while it is still plentiful to have (and believe me, I built a ship 32 blocks long), you might find yourself still shorthanded if you like to build big ships (like replicas of the Enterprise or a Star Destroyer). Of course though, the latter is my own opinion, based off the near 85 hours I put into this game.\n\nIf you want to build ships or structures of your own design, build up an HQ for your clan (or "Nation" as they are called), or have a hearty crew to fly around with, firing off your arsenal of cannons and turrets either at players or a massive beast, this is definitely the game for you.\n\nPersonal Note: I bought this game out of my love for two seperate games, being combined into one. Odds are if you love Guns of Icarus Online, or Minecraft, you would love having this game in your Steam library. The community is so very friendly, while small, still friendly. The developer himself even hops on the servers occasionally to check out other people's creations and play alongside other players. I played this game with some friends before, and we had a blast flying ships, building our own ships, and even fighting off a Magmasite Queen in one of them. If you want to see this game with a bigger playerbase, buy the game and be apart of it for starters. The servers are fairly decent if you are worried of lagging much, and you can pretty well customize how you look, what you're flying, and how your Nation's capital looks. I fully recommend this game if you want to fly your own personalized airship, and explore the open-world of flying mountains, islands, glaciers, and other lands with ancient secrets waiting to be uncovered.","August 9, 2015","true","213.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

Create a ship made of iron, build up a nation from nothing, maybe recruit a friend.\n\nWith the vast amount of voxel games that have popped up in the last year or two, this one feels the most distinct to me. Unfortunately, it also feels like the most unappreciated one as well. Yes, it does need some polishing regarding aesthetics and bugs, but that isn't really important at this stage, considering it's early access. Also, I should mention, while other Early access games are rated positive for their potential (which much of the time goes unfulfilled) I'm rating this one for what it is  now,  that being a fantastic game.\n\nMost of the negative reviews for this game are regarding the game population. On all servers combined, there aren't many players, true. But seriously, that's the worst excuse I've heard not to buy this game. First of all, if you actually stuck with the game, hey, you know what? You'd increase the playerbase! These people are actually creating their own problem with the game. Second, to enjoy this game, you don't really need to have many people on. Trust me, even if there is a low playerbase, you will run into other people. And they'll likely be pirates, so try to keep your shotgun handy at all times.\n\nLastly, the Dev is awesome. He adds new content fairly often, chats with people in-game, and listens to community suggestions. Really friendly and chill dude. So basically, buy this game if you like building, pirating, shotguns, lasers, (did I mention that there are lasers?) and giant floating machine spheres left by the ancients.

It's not a hugely popular game, but I find I can't stay away from it. It combines all the fun of standard voxel games with the ability to explore the world with your own custom designed ships.\n\nWhen I first joined there wasn't much here. At the time, what a lot of the negative reviews said were true: The game had plenty of flaws. But it was, and still is, in Early Access, and it's still moving towards its full release. I'm proud to say that I am a part of its community that it is steering the game in its current direction.\n\nSky Nations, like many voxel games, it most likely a success because of its huge degree of freedom. It is the canvas on which a pilot's creativity comes to life. Do want to build a small sleek ship? Or do you want to be like me, and design a ship that is literally a moving house?\n\nOf course, you don't need to be a creative genius to have fun in the game. The game has always been advertised with a piracy aspect, and its something that is immensely thrilling. The ability to board a ship, dispose of its occupants, and fly away with your new prize is incredibly satisfying.\n\nThe lead developer, Mr Benjammin, has recently implemented a Capitols system. No longer do you need to worry about logging off and having your ship stolen. Just park it in your capitol and it'll be there when you come back. Then you can resume your pirate adventures in your shiny ship.\n\nBut what fun is flying in a ship by yourself? Join a nation (or make your own) and fly the skies as an unstoppable pirate fleet! Friendship and teamwork are a huge part of what keeps this game interesting for me, and the frequent updates ensure that the game stays fresh.\n\nSo, in conclusion:\n\n+Wide degree of freedom\n+Loads of fun with friends and enemies alike\n+Arrr, pirates!\n+A small but loyal community that continues to grow\n+One of the most friendly and responsive developers I've ever met\n+Great moderator team\n+It's not finished yet\n-It's not finished yet\n-Needs more cats\n\nGGG for life!","February 24, 2015","true","232.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","1"

Sometimes, I'll log on, ignore all the things that need to be done to my nation, and I'll just go out and explore. Sky Nations is an ever-changing world, both in-game and update-wise, so there's always something new to see.\n\nThat being said, the biggest draw to the game for me is the constant progression. It's a small game, so it's not difficult to start out, but there's a very long way to go before you can really become a powerful force on a server. Despite that, almost every single time I play, i feel like I'm achieving something new. Even the smallest thing, like building a public bathroom in my capital, will satisfy me. In this way, Sky Nations keeps on pulling me back in.\n\nThere are flaws. Plenty of them. It feels like I discover a new bug every 2 weeks. But the dev is always there to help smooth things through, and if not him, one of the myriad of compassionate admins.\nA very important thing to remember is that Sky Nations is not only in early-access, but is also being made by one guy. It's obviously not going to be very polished. But despite that, I still prefer playing Sky Nations to a lot of other games in my (admittedly not extensive) library. That's because what Sky Nations has right now is already better than half the games on steam right now.\n\nVoxel games and first person games are absolutely not my forte. I'm sure that's the case for many of the people considering buying this game. But I see absolutely no reason for someone on the fence about buying this to not get it. It's got great community, a great dev, very good gameplay, it's even better with friends, and it's got flying cats.\n\n","March 14, 2015","true","197.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

I would deffinetly say to you, "Only buy it if you are looking for a fun, layed back kinda game." This is only because of the nature of the game. The game costs alot of money but is a heck of fun to play. You create your ship, You battle other players and you upgrade said ship. This can all be done with a matter of machines, Blocks and tools.\n\nThe blocks in the game are standard. Things like stone, wood and dirt. But the way you can use these are much bigger than your conventional sandbox game (I'm lookin' at you Minecraft) You can build your base ontop of a giant pill shaped island. You can mine out Molton Rock to power your Mass Generators (More on that in a bit.) You can use copper to create repeaters to gun down other ships. Iron to make cannons to take out larger ships. This list goes on and this is only the start.\n\nWhen you get into the machinery such as the Mass Generator or the Energy Storage Unit you get into the advanced Burntout Cores. These cores can be gotten either by buying them from the Merchant Cat (More on him later) or taken from the machine planet. The machine planet is a giant planet made of indistructium, an indistrucatble alloy, with different floors and holes in the side for entering. Burntout cores are the basis for all major machinery such as the Mass Generator which makes your ship create more energy per second which can help you with more thrusters and thus more speed.\n\nThe tools aren't very unique with a mix of Guns of Icarus and Minecraft. You have a mallet for breaking things. Then you have tools such as a hammer, a wrench and a fire extinguisher for fixing items. Then you have an electric prod as a melee weapon. Then you have to build a shotgun as a major line of defense. I still find these items unique in a way because they bring their own style to the game.\n\nFinally, everything else. The islands are unique having their own ways of showing. Such as a molten rock planet that you can gain your items for your mass generator. A giant pill shaped island that can be used too create a large base. Normal islands that contain trees on the top and sand on the bottom. The list is endless. But there is one thing in the middle of all of this that everyone loves and often dispise. The Merchant Cat. This cat flys around the different sectors of the world selling goods of all kinds. He is the bane of everyones existance because he gives a warning of getting off his ship within on eminute and can take you off with him to the next sector. But everyone loves him because... Ya know... He's a freeking cat. He sells all kinds of goods. You just need to catch him on a good time. He even buys goods for copper coins so you can buy his goods.\n\nOverall this game is brilliant but if you are looking for a serious game and not a fun layed back one stay away from this. I don't want you soiling it... Goodday players and have a good one.","August 2, 2014","true","15.0"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

The game manages to take the cube look of Minecraft (and other voxel games) yet create an experience unlike any other. My initial impressions of the game would that it would be like a mod for Minecraft, a mining game with airships tacked on. Oh how wrong I was.\n\nIt has a fantastic way of balancing the time spent flying and mining, and a visible effort has been put into making the airships run smoothly. Whilst there is plenty of room to add more tools and block types, the current set works amazingly and I can see it forming a solid foundation for expansion. For anyone reading this who doesn't have the game, I can't stress enough how much it isn't like Minecraft. Visually, yes but in terms of gameplay very different.\n\nThe only criticisms I could make would involve cleaning up the engine a bit. This game doesn't run as well as similar games on the same hardware and since my last play I was unable to change the render distance.\n\nI would recommend purchasing the Alpha, as I can see this game becoming so much more awesome than it already is. Definitely worth the money and a play."\n\n\nNow this was a review of the game a year ago, when it was in a far more unstable, unbalanced, unoptimized state.\nKudos to you MrBenjamin, you've made a damn fine game and it was an honour talking to you when it was first released. It's fantastic seeing this game flying high (hehe...airships) and getting the praise it deserves.\n\nA fantastic game to play with friends, there's nothing like exploring a floating land and building an airship to your custom design.\n\n10/10 I would reccommend","September 19, 2014","true","4.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Airships, bases, housing, etc...\n\nHowever. the game's community Ruins a lot of that. Initial spawn areas are littered with incomplete ships left by people who don't bother to read the hints/tutorials. If you're good enough to get a ship going though, don't fly too close, 'cause griefers and trolls will literally steal your ship out from under you by breaking the block you're standing on and letting you fall to your doom while they try to make off with your ship. Luckily you don't lose inventory on death, so that's a little bit of frustration mitigation.\nNations (guilds, essentially) eem to be led by folks who are so leery of potential trolls and griefers being brought in, that most team up requests go ignored. I asked the same person 3 times, and got no response, while they explained to another person who'd asked once they they weren't 'allowed' to let just anyone in.\n\nGameplay is simple enough, being indeed similar to minecraft, despite the "this is not a minecraft clone" arguments. And no, it's not a minecraft clone, but more of an offshoot of minecraft. It's still rough, and has tons of potential. but i'm holding off until the player population matures, or a single player mode is implemented.\n\nthe game itself gets an 8/10 from me. but due to the in-game community, i've got to cut that to a 3/10. By all mean, sif you like EVE online, and like minecraft, go ahead and get this. if you want to support the development of a potentially great game, buy this.","October 25, 2014","false","12.6"," 18 of 37 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","18","37","0","2"

A full review will be published once Sky Nations has released. Also note that I have over 15 hours on the game and I played it when it wasn't on Steam; when it had its own launcher.\n\nConstruct Airships and wage war in a sandbox world populated by floating islands, sprawling skies and adventure. Ride on ships and build them while your motley drive you forward, toward exploration. Persistent player servers and much more await! Sky Nations is available on Steam and is being developed and published by Damaged, which as far as I know, is a one-man developing team.\n\nI am going to start off by talking about the graphics because they are part of the reason why the game works so well. Yes; it's another voxel game. But that doesn't stop it from being creative on what it aims to be. There are new textures and new blocks such as laser blocks, engines, and a lot more. The textures feel fresh and not just thrown in there to be there. This allows players to have a sort of relaxed feeling as they are riding on their self-made space ships, looking at the "scenery".\n\nAn awesome part to the game is how easily players can get going on their space ship. It also provides for a fun experience with easily being able to get minerals, add defense to your ship, and join other factions. There are plenty of parts to craft for your ship, allowing for some neat customization options.\n\nI do have a few gripes with the game at its current state. One, I dislike the system of being able to steal from other people's ships. The reason I dislike this is because, as I was a new player once, newbies will play the game for a few hours, get a nice ship, probably not be invited into a nice faction, and then log off. The next day their ship will be looted and then they would have to start from square one; which I have to say is very frustrating. Although it does add a little survival aspect to it, it's definitely disappointing. Another gripe I have is with the server connection. When you want to have ship battles with other people and/or fight them 1v1 the battle will be all over the place because of the connection lag, which drops the intensity of the game to almost laughable. Lastly, this game is not very original. You can easily get some mods for Minecraft that either have the same amount of content or more than, which is disappointing.\n\nAlthough it is overall a great game, bringing some new textures and a neat voxel space system to the table, it lacks on a few key features.\n\n6.5/10\n","July 17, 2014","true","1.4"," 13 of 30 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","13","30","0","1"
