Easily runnable. Smooth as butter.\n• Beautiful cut scenes/visuals\n• Clean menu\n• Night/Day Cycle\n• Weather effects how you take on missions\n• You can easily get immersed in the game and play it for hours without even knowing it\n• Tons of mission and side objectives\n• Everything you do in-game affects the current and future missions\n• Those who can stragically plan better will have an easier time progressing through missions with a higher score\n• Various weapons/tools/items/gear to research\n• Custmomizable "Mother Base" with soldiers and objects/items from the open world\n• You can infiltrate other players bases and steal soldiers/resources\n• Dog Companion that grows with you throughout the game (Must find puppy on battlefield and extract it to acquire one)\n• Intelligent AI (If they want to hunt you down and kill you. They will)\n• If you punch one of your soldiers in the face, They'll thank you for it.\n• Not a game you can just breeze through in just 10-20 hours. Yes. It will take a lot more time.\n\nControversial Features\n• Mission checkpoints can have a large gap. Punishing your stupidity and impatience\n\nGame Cons\n• Storyline seemed to be lacking\n• Other than the prologue which contained a ton of cut scenes. There isn't a lot of cut scenes after that. Wish there was a little more (Not that big of a deal)\n• AI and player pathing has a few bugs when encountering ladders or something of the sort in small places (Doesn't happen a lot. But had to throw it in)\n• Can feel repetitve at times (Go here and kill/rescure this person)\n• Hackers have already been spotted while online (FoB Attacks)\n• You CAN NOT bind anything to a numpad key. Which really blows for left handed PC gamers\n\nRelateable Games\n• Metal Gear Solid: Ground Zero\n\nConclusionMetal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is already on my favorite games list. The amount of content and things to do is incredible. The developers took some serious time to plan out everything. Overall, they put thought into every little detail to make this game what it is. If you got the time and patience to take on a lot of soldiers on your own, investigate, interrogate, and annihilate. Then this is the game for you.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sandygunfox/recommended/287700/","sandygunfox","SandyGunfox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sandygunfox/","821 products in account","In five hours I adopted a wolfdog pup, kidnapped a spetsnaz officer, got mauled by a bear, repainted a helicopter, used the Fulton Recovery System on a passing goat, and sniped a spetsnaz recon team while She Blinded Me With Science played on cassette.\n\nYep, it's a Hideo Kojima game.\n\nEDIT: So, this review got more votes than I expected. Why don't I edit it to be a little more useful?\n\nI have 24 hours in the game as of writing this - and it came out yesterday. That should tell you something.\n\nPROS- Who's a good boy? DD's a good boy! DD is a good boy, yes he is!\n- The Fox engine is excellently optimized. This game should be playable with beautiful graphics even on middle-tier systems. If you can run Ground Zeroes, you can run this.\n- The open world is well-done. It's also huge, but it feels dense enough that you're never more than a few hundred meters from something to Fulton. Environments are somewhat varied.\n- There are multiple ways to approach any enemy installation, ranging from the obvious to the easily missed. It's encouraged to find a perch a couple hundred meters away and scout ahead.\n- The world itself is well-done, too. There are weather changes, a day/night cycle, and these actually affect gameplay by making stealth easier or harder.\n- You can Fulton extract anything. Anything. Soldiers? Of course. Cargo containers? Yes. Jeeps? Sure. Emplaced machine guns, mortars, AA guns? Definitely. Tanks? Yep! Bears, sheep, goats, and buzzards? Absolutely. I'm surprised you can't fulton-extract the freaking buildings at this rate.\n- Mother Base management is like a more fleshed-out version of Peace Walker's. In many ways, this game is Peace Walker 2, and I definitely put that in the "pro" category.\n- Good soundtrack full of 80s pop and rock hits that you can blare out of a helicopter. Also, you can upload custom songs and have your helicopter play them.\n- I have 24 hours in the game and am at 17% completion - needless to say this game is not wanting for content. There are tons of missions and side-ops to do and hundreds of items to research, upgrade, and customize.\n- Speaking of customizing, you can customize the base's paint schemes, your unit's emblem, your helicopter, various vehicles, and hand-pick your loadout for every mission.\n- Mission checkpoint system generally means missions are neither too hard and frustrating, nor too hand-holdy.\n- 24 hours in, I haven't felt a pressing need to grind. I've progressed perfectly well just by doing all the missions and new side-ops, without going back and repeating old missions (except for on several occasions just plain wanting to replay missions!). There may be more grinding ahead, but it certainly doesn't beat you up with it early-on.\n- There are some surprises, even in the open-world. Without spoiling, I at one point unexpectedly walked right into a sniper duel while on my way to do a side-op. The weather changes often quite rapidly, creating unscripted emergent situations. I've had a sudden, unexpected sandstorm screw up an attempt to snipe a base full of enemy soldiers, leaving me running to salvage my plans when a body was discovered before I could finish. Fortunately, this can help you as well.\n- The gameplay itself is fun. I find myself going hours at a time without actually doing missions or progressing the plot purely because it's fun to attack the hundreds of outposts and bases in the open world.\n\n\nCONS- While the AI isn't entirely stupid - and they're capable of surprising you from time to time - in general you'll learn pretty quickly how to pick guards off one at a time, thus making actual sneaking unnecessary.\n- This problem was also true in Peace Walker and MGS4 - you'll have hundreds of different firearms, but have a reason to use maybe five of them. Fortunately, there is some sense of progression, as you can upgrade guns over time.\n- Kiefer Sutherland doesn't talk as much as David Hayter's Snake did. Most of his talking is done over cassette, too. I miss Hayter's "commentary" in the world.\n- The box may not say it, but this is a Hideo Kojima game, and it will remind you of this. Again. And again. And again. And again.\n- Mother Base is explorable this time around, but it's a little empty. The game encourages you to return to it frequently, but there isn't really much to actually do there - at least so far.\n- Microtransactions buy stuff that can accellerate and skip build timers. The good news is I've yet to feel punished or forced to use them, but they ARE present and I'm not buying them on general principle. However, I have gotten some MB Coins for free.\n- The ending, without spoiling things, is rushed. It's painfully obvious content was cut. Some plot threads are mostly unresolved. You should search online for the cut content, there are some videos from the collector's edition of an unfinished mission that tied together a major plot thread at the end.\n\n\nOther Notes- MGS fans might find the game as a whole, and especially Kiefer Sutherland's Snake, very quiet. After the opening chapter, gone are the intrusive, hour-long cutscenes. Most are a few seconds or minutes long. There are no extended Codec conversations either. However! Much of the story and the content that used to take up long Codec calls is now found in cassette tapes, which can be played any time you want. This ends up being a good tradeoff, as you can listen to the long diversionary rants on random topics while still doing stuff in the game. Do yourself a favor and keep up on new cassette entries while you're out in the world.\n- Reflex Mode is back from Ground Zeroes. This is, to put it mildly, controversial, with some people thinking it makes the game far too easy. If you're in that camp, it can be disabled.\n- The story is shaping up to be significantly darker in tone compared to past games. If you've played Ground Zeroes, this isn't a surprise. However, I find it hasn't lost that Metal Gear charm.\n- Lots of reviews, previously including this one, complained about long commutes and lack of fast travel. There is a fast-travel system, every enemy base has a fast-travel point that you have to unlock by finding it and picking up an object that lets you use it.\n\n\nConclusionIt's only September, and I've found my GOTY already. This is more than a worthy entry into the franchise; it is easily competitive for the title of Best Metal Gear Solid Game. If this is to be the last real MGS game, it's a worthy sendoff of a beloved franchise. 10/10.\n\nOh, and please do not add me to your friends list if I don't know you.","September 1, 2015","true","185.4"," 1,723 of 1,920 people (90%) found this review helpful 663 people found this review funny","90","723","1","663","28"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Excuritas/recommended/287700/","Excuritas","Excuritas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Excuritas/","1887 products in account","ATTENTION: Words colored black are spoilers, so only hover over them if you're prepared for that!\nMetal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is an open world action-adventure stealth game developed by Kojima Productions, directed, designed, co-produced and co-written by Hideo Kojima. The eleventh canonical and final installment in the Metal Gear series, and the fifth within the series' chronology.\n\nI’m still not exactly sure what to think about the game, as it’s both the best and the worst game I have ever played. I really enjoyed the gameplay and I think it’s one of the best open world games out today. However, as a metal gear solid fan who has played the previous entries in the series, the ending felt unfinished and wasn’t very satisfying.\n\nIn fact, most of The Phantom Pain's second half doesn’t really feel complete either. Many of the main ops in Chapter Two are basically retreads of the early missions at a higher difficulty, and their role as padding couldn't be more evident. The true “ending” isn't revealed in some grand, explosive fashion, but is simply presented on your list of things to do once you reach a specific set of milestones, making it feel hastily slapped in to give all of your prior actions context.\n\nIt's a shame, as there's no sense of closure from the revelation that we were the fake Big Boss all along, and the story as a whole ends up feeling hollow as a result. There are rumours that Konami cut Kojima’s budget at some point and even denied his desire to work on the game for even longer, maybe that is one of the reasons behind this.\n\nLikes and Dislikes below. They are just my personal opinions, so I strongly recommend reading other reviews as well.\n\nLIKEDMother Base Management\nAssigning soldiers, developing new weapons and gadgets, and further expanding your Mother Base often kept me busy in an enjoyable way\n\nFreedom of Choice\nNumerous ways to solve missions and objectives. You can either go in completely silent, killing or sleep darting every target with suppressor, or go in loud with machine guns, rocket launchers, grenade launchers, and even tanks. To accomplish either, you have an abundance of tools and gadgets at your disposal. The good old cardboard box, a stealth camouflage device, C4 that you can place even on the backs of enemy soldiers, inflatable decoys that look just like you, explosive and sleep-gas mines, claymores, etc.\n\nInterrogation\nYou can slowly creep up on soldiers and aiming your gun on them, they will notice and drop their weapon, begging you to not kill them. You can then choose to interrogate, kill, or just choke them till they pass out. If you choose to interrogate them, you’re granted useful information about the current area. Locations of hidden resources, diamonds, even prisoners or your mission target\n\nSupply Drops\nThey allow you to refill ammo, suppressors and fultons during missions. You can even drop vehicles wherever you need them\n\nFulton Surface-to-Air Recovery System\nIt's awesome and often hilarious! You can “recruit” new soldiers with this and remove them from the mission area at the same time. It contributes to your progression, and you don’t have to hide their bodies, which can be found and woken by others. You can also extract vehicles, containers or even animals… Later in the progression, the balloon is replaced with a black hole device, allowing you to even extract even while indoors\n\nFluid Movement\nThe transition from prone to crouching is very well done\n\nPerforms Well\nNo fps drops, no lags, no blue screens, just smooth!\n\nDamn good console port\nOne of the best console ports ever created, I played it with keyboard/mouse and it was awesome\n\nNever seen before degree of Weapon customization\nCreate your own favourite weapon out of dozens of weapon parts\n\nCassette Tapes\nThough some of them would’ve been better off as cutscenes\n\nFOB's\n1vs1 online mode is intense and fun and you have to be really good to make it through 60 AI enemies and 1 real player\n\nPrecise Shooting Mechanics\nYou can even shoot trough small holes and there will be no invisible wall that blocks your shots\n\nGreat Soundtrack\nAwesome songs in there, I recommend checking it out. Seriously, go buy it!\n\nCustom Songs\nYou can add your own songs to the game and even set one of those as your helicopter arrival music\nDISLIKEDCover System\nThere’s no key to enter into cover against walls or boxes, it’s a dynamic system that’s at times unreliable\n\nSilent Snake\nSnake is quite the silent protagonist, and most of his dialogue is on the optional cassette tapes... During cutscenes and crucial events, he often said nothing, letting others talk for him\n\nDriving Vehicles\nFeels oddly quirky in this game, but its functional at least. Most of the time you will drift with a vehicle trying to avoid a stone, but just to crash right into it anyway\n\n“To be continued” at the end of many story missions\nIt’s not a movie and doesn’t feel like one\n\nNotable lack of cutscenes\nIt’s unlike other Metal Gear Solid games and if there are any, they are very short compared to other MGS games\n\nCheckpoint System\nBe ready to do stuff again along the lines of Dark Souls... you die, everything is back, with no manual saving\n\nClimbing Ledges\nIt’s a real pain in the ♥♥♥ if the edges aren’t even. Your character tries to climb, but can't and just gets pushed back down. This can even draw enemies attention as you try to climb a ledge but just can’t, even though the game is telling you that you should be able to\n\nCheaters in FOB Mode\nI really hope Konami does something about this\n\nCredits after and during the intro of every mission\nAs if every mission was an episode of a TV series... It feels out of place in this game and gets annoying after a while\n\nNo Interesting Bossfights\nThe first Metal Gear title without them\n\nThe sudden change from David Hayter to a different voice actor, Kiefer Sutherland\nEven though you aren't really playing Big Boss in this game the real Big Boss doesn't even have David Hayter’s voice\n\nRepetitive Side Missions\nExtract the Highly Skilled Soldier, Prisoner Extraction, Eliminate the Heavy Infantry, Mine clearing, Eliminate the Tank Unit, Target practice… etc. They all can be done a bunch of times in different locations and gets slightly harder each time. It’s boring as it’s basically the same task over and over again...\n\nNo useful fast-travel-system\nThere is no useful/functional fast-travel-system, you need to call in the chopper and that generates some unwanted downtime. Sure there is the cardboardbox fast-travel-system but you can only activate it if there are no soldiers around... And this for an open-world game is very bad\nDo I recommend the game? Hell yeah, it is amazing! Awesome gameplay, nice story and a great soundtrack making this game one of my all-time favourites, even though it has some flaws…\nWith over 200 hours of fun this game, it was well worth the money for me too!\n\nIf you should have any questions about the game or my review, feel free to leave a comment or add me directly.\n\nAchievements: 100%\nOverall Completion: 100%\n\nUPDATE: 07.10.2015\n\nKonami is further ♥♥♥♥ing up MGSV by adding even more microtransactions and has added an insurance which allows you to steal as much stuff as you want and people won't even have a chance to get it back anymore. -> http://www.pcgamer.com/metal-gear-solid-5-update-adds-fob-insurance-paid-for-with-real-money/","September 13, 2015","true","206.3"," 626 of 749 people (84%) found this review helpful 38 people found this review funny","84","626","749","38","57"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/weavoid/recommended/287700/","weavoid","Weavoid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/weavoid/","54 products in account","Since I now have 100%, I guess it's time to review this game.\n\nIt's damn incredible. The gameplay is pretty much flawless. In my 300+ hours of playtime I haven't found a single bug. Well, except an AI-driven truck trying to do some offroading, with hilarious results.\n\nThe AI is really smart, able to wipe you out if you aren't careful. They use teamwork and don't aim like Stormtroopers or cheaters, being nicely in the middle. The buddy system is great, and each of Snake's companions feels like it has a purpose, with D-Dog being my personal favourite. There's a buddy for every playstyle, as long as you develop the right equipment. Speaking of development, this game has a ridiculous amount of weapons and items to develop, and even after getting 100% I still have new guns and upgrades to try out (They don't count to 100%).\n\nAs for the story, it's a strange one, and it has a lot of different opinions. I do agree with the majority saying that Skull Face isn't a massively interesting villain, mainly due to the fact that he barely makes an appearance until later on.\n\nENDGAME SPOILERS\nThe final plot twist was pretty good too, as I have a nice little idea on what Kojima meant by it, but it's too long to fully explain. Basically, I thought he wanted us to be a victim of Big Boss' antagonism, rather than play as him ourselves.\n\nAs for the graphics, the game looks excellent, with the FOX Engine keeping the game running at a smooth 50-60FPS, and my PC isn't exactly the best around. The sound and music is also incredible, with the music ranging from the calming flutes of Afghanistan to the pounding, intense drums of a combat alert in Africa. The soundtrack also accompanies the mood brilliantly.\n\nSo, do I recommend this game? Absolutely. I almost can't fault it, and it's everything it was hyped up to be. Easily game of the year contender.","November 8, 2015","true","479.8"," 372 of 444 people (84%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","84","372","444","26","15"

The enemy AI is well improved as it will take skill to get passed.\n\nYou can also call on your allies to even distract some of the attention caused like helicopters, your animal or human companions to even help. If you are also new to the MGS series, do not worry because if you fail the missions a few times which of course I did on a few, you will get a Chicken Hat that either reduces the enemies spot target to half or even the baby chicken hat which basically makes you a ghost through the missions.\nPlenty of other side op missions to do as well, you can also you can of course upgrade your weapons, tools, base in which you can control teams and send them on missions to expand your base. Being open world as well you also get vehicles to traverse around Afghanistan's rocky deserts whether it will be by horseback, D-Walker, or other means of transportation.\n\nTons of great characters and a great line of voice actors that really made the character as  Kiefer Sutherland this time plays Snake. Controls are smoothe and responsive when you play as Snake, only problem I had was on certain vehicles like the D-Walker where on those controls I felt like a ♥♥♥♥♥ trying to be stealthy as I was roller skating my way while bumping into obstacles trying to reach the next mission. Nothing serious there, but sometimes the controls can get frustrating when you are spotted and trying to hide again.\n\nMusical score is beautiful, graphics are amazing, no reason to go into detail on that.\nAs always you guys, would I recommend it?\nThat is a definate yes, it's Metal Gear Solid! Go and buy it..like now!\n\nStory is decent, classic and awesome characters, fun gameplay that will last hours on end because I have barely scratched the surface with this one as it provides so much more in game than what I could explain, I just had to throw in my opinion on this one.\n\nMuch Love, Much Recommendation","September 5, 2015","true","30.0"," 439 of 551 people (80%) found this review helpful 87 people found this review funny","80","439","551","87","5"

There are tons of missions and side missions for you to immerse yourself in as well as a base building mechanic which can be quite time consuming on its own.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone looking for a rich single player experince who is willing to invest quite a few hours into the game in order to fully experince it.

I'm not going to lie, if you ask me if i recommend this game, **** YES, this game is great in all parts.\n\nPROS\n+ It have great graphics\n+ Good story (more less).\n+ Incredible addictive open-world gameplay.\n+ Good sound effects.\n+ Exceptional soundtrack (but they don't use it, don't ask me why).\n+ Have plenty of hours of play time.\n+ The reasons behind the actions of each characters are well designed and well explained.\n+ One of the best optimisations i've ever see.\n+ The emptiness you feel when you end the game (i will explain that later)\n+ Even if the game isn't as good as their predecessors, it have some "Kojima's momments" that are great and epic.\n\nThat were the positive things, now let go to the negatives parts of the game:\n- Even if the story is good, it's not stand for a MGS story.\n- It have micro-transactions.\n- The side ops are repetitive and boring.\n- The tecnology that is used in the game (1984) is better than the one use in the first MGS (2005).\n- The characters are great, but they don't really progress in the game (except Big Boss)\n- It doesn't give a satisfactory end to this franchise.\n- The bosses are horribly bad (for a MGS game).\n- And the worst of all, IT IS **** INCOMPLETE. Almost all the second chapter missions are missions of the first chapter, but with more difficulty. There was suposse to be a 3rd chapter, but it just didn't happen, and so i can't pass the fact that this game is incomplete, even if it wasn't Kojima's intention.\n\nEXPLANATION (CONTAINS SPOILERS):\nBy saying "The emptiness you feel when you finish the game" i wanted to say that it is as if everything had gone to hell. Even if you have the mother base, and everyone love you, in reality you've loose everything. You lost your identity and  your best companion and at the same time your love. This leave me with an emptiness feeling, like if everything that i've achieved during the game was nothing, because, as i just said, it feels like if you've lost everything you care about. I think that this is the feeling Kojima want to transmit, The Phantom Pain of the ones that are no longer on your side. This is the first time in the whole game that i feel something similar to what others MGS games made me feel.\nIt is great to know that Kojima is still the same as always.\n\nRATING: 75/100\n\nI give this game the tittle of: DISAPPOINTMENT","September 1, 2015","true","66.4"," 244 of 322 people (76%) found this review helpful 32 people found this review funny","76","244","322","32","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/287700/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is an open world; action adventure stealth based game, developed by Kojima Productions and published by Konami. Releasing on PC, PS3, PS4, Xbox 360 and Xbox One in September 2015. This has been touted as the final instalment in the Metal Gear series; however it is the eleventh game to come out since the franchise started.  This is a prequel to the original Metal Gear Solid game that was released way back in 1987.\n\nWe all pretty much know what to expect from a Metal Gear Solid game by now, but for those that don’t; MGS is a stealth based game where you play in third person controlling Big Boss. Phantom Pain is an open world environment, which is a little different to how previous titles in the series have gone, but it is a nice change.  You sneak from point to point avoiding guards, search lights and patrols whilst training to remain undetected. You are always encouraged to try and progress through the game by being as lethal as possible, so you are equipped with a tranquilizer dart from the beginning of the game.  Phantom Pain also includes a base-building element, which allows you to develop weapons and items for yourself. You are able to recruit enemy soldiers to work in your base as well, which is definitely a nice touch.  Phantom Pain also has a new day-night cycle added in as well, which means you can plan certain activities for different times of the day, such as infiltrating a base is easier at night due to the lack of light. It is so in depth that you are able to study the patrol paths of guards for certain times of the day, and even the shifts of the guards, giving you all that extra couple of seconds to sneak in unnoticed.\n\nGraphically, Phantom Pain is just breath taking. Obviously I couldn’t play at 4k, but even a mere resolution of 1440p, it just looks gorgeous. The near life like look to this game is honestly one of the best looking games to ever be made. The PC version puts the console versions to shame and by a large scale as well. The crispness of all the modelling is perfect. Not to mention the stellar animation of everything and anything. I am struggling to find words to describe just how good this game is in this department. We have come to know that MGS games have pretty epic sound tracks too, and Phantom Pain is no different; being produced by a four time MGS veteran, Harry Gregson-Williams makes a return. Throughout the game you are able to find collectable cassette tapes which you can play during game play of the extracts of the soundtrack itself.\n\nPhantom Pain is only tricky if you go in all guns-blazing. This type of game you have to plan your steps methodically and put your plan in place before you move.  I did have to refer to a walkthrough at times to give me an insight on how to progress on some quests and areas but the majority of the time you can work it out for yourself with ease if you just pay attention.  The game’s prologue which acts as a tutorial system does well to introduce a lot of the game’s core mechanics to any new players too.\n\nThe game has taken me just over 50 hours to complete the main story with a good portion of side missions.  There are roughly 150 side missions to complete and I would highly recommend people try do as many as possible, not only does it add hours and hours of content, but the rewards you reap from them are far from useless.\n\nSomehow the game for me was technically sound. I was at least expecting some bugs and issues given that it is a vast open world game, but I had no problems at all. I played with keyboard and mouse and was surprised at how well it controlled. Normally I play third person games with a gamepad, but I expected precision to be key, so of course the mouse makes that the perfect tool for the job.\n\nMy conclusion on Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is that it is a near enough perfect game with no flaws from what I can see. I loved it from start to finish, and I really will be replaying the game at least one more time at a future date, just because it is a masterpiece of a game.

I enjoyed it so much I bought it and it became one of my favourite games. I subsequently went on to play all the rest in the series.\n\nI’ve been looking forward MGS V before it was even announced. I ate up all the trailers from the first rumoured trailer of the hospital scene to all the e3 gameplay trailers. I was hyped for it.\n\nThe first 50 or so hours of this game were amazing. The new smooth gameplay mechanics were great. You could even crouch walk AND prone crawl in the same game! Excellently optimized, great graphics and Ground Zeros had me hyped for a deep, story-rich experience that would blow everyone away.\n\nWhat can I say though, I was left mostly disappointed like many MGS fans have been. If you’re new to the game franchise, sure this game is probably great since you probably don’t really care about the backstory or legacy. Probably just a new shiny AAA title with amazing graphics that everyone’s playing lately, and I hope you enjoy it. But, I don’t believe this game is worthy of being part of the MGS legacy, for these and more reasons.\n\n1.THE STORY suffers severely and arguably compared to previous MGS games, has no life or crescendo like others in the series. The story just flutters along with no sense of immediate urgency.\n\n2. THE GAME is noticeably incomplete we are left with loose ends.\n\n3. THE MISSIONS are rehashed and repetitive about sums it up (Extract this, eliminate that over and over)\n\n4. GRINDING away fultoning things and developing weapons is mostly the gameplay rather than actually playing the story\n\n5. HUGE WORLD is empty with nothing to do but travel between bases. No civilians, just soldiers here and there with animals.\n\n6. ALL CHECKPOINTS and bases are the same, with the exception of the few major ones.\n\n7. INTERIOR BUILDINGS are almost non-existent. MSG has always had large detailed buildings you had to infiltrate. The largest buildings in this game are virtually inaccessible.\n\n8. MGS ONLINE didn’t even release with the game goes to show how Konami shoehorned this game out the door before it was ready\n\n9. CHAPTER 2 is a joke. Enough said. Chapter 3 was cut from the game.\n\n10. MINIMAL DIALOGUE from Big Boss. Why hire a big film actor as a voice actor if he hardly speaks in the game?\n\n11. IF YOU forked out extra money for the collector’s edition, you were teased showing some of the material that was cut from the game and we will never ever experience! Wow!\n\n12. PATROLS are only around the outposts, you never get to see high scale convoys around the map.\n\n13. VEHICLE VARIETY is severely lacking for a MGS game. Two types of car, two types of truck, two types of APC, Two types of tank, Two types of helicopter. Considering the size of the game, that is extremely small. Even peace walker has more variety!\n\n14. ENEMIES are always on the defensive. The player is supposed to be the defensive outnumbered character.\n\n15. THERE'S NO Muyahideens fighting the russians at Afghanistan. That makes no sense considering they were the biggest guerrilla group in the Afghan conflict. The russians never realize military operations against the Muyahideens, that makes no sense either. Remembering all those battles between PMC’s and militia in MGS4 anyone?\n\n16. THE TANK you build in the base doesn't even do anything, why did they even bother putting it in the game? Was its purpose also scrapped? Huey goes on about it being some awesomely powerful weapon. It's only used for getting S rank outer ops missions. ZEKE was way better, you could customize it and everything.\n\n17. OUTER OPS suck compared to MGS Peace walker. I enjoyed making up teams of soldiers and vehicles. Probably because of the lack of vehicles variety.\n\n18. RESEARCH TIMERS? It looks like it was where the Pay-to-Win milking was going to occur, buy points to speed up the development! Luckily they seem to have taken it out, but now it just makes no sense being in the game.\n\n19. FOB MULTIPLAYER is lame, and more of an annoyance than anything. There doesn't seem to be any real purpose to doing it, you usually don't even steal any significant staff or resources.\n\n20. HOW SKULL FACE was defeated was extremely underwhelming and unsatisfying. Surely he would have had some interesting boss fight in store like most MGS games, but nope. Sahelanthropus was easy to defeat and not a challenge. The skulls are probably the lamest mini-bosses in all the MGS series. The cobras and B&B were way better and each had more story.\n\n21. NO CONSEQUENCE for murdering everyone and setting off the alarm. At most they may send 4 clueless reinforcements or a helicopter in late game which are easily taken out.\n\n22. REMEMBER at the start of MGS4 how it had those videos showing how the PMCS and war economies had spread into modern society, providing some setting/backstory. So many cutscenes, especially the long ones that are always in MGS games are missing.\n\nIn regards to this game, Solid snake once said "Building the future and keeping the past alive are one and the same thing." Not this game.","October 5, 2015","false","140.4"," 914 of 1,319 people (69%) found this review helpful 40 people found this review funny","69","914","1","40","69"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mishan/recommended/287700/","Mishan","Misha","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mishan/","895 products in account","About\nWelcome to the world of Metal Gear, where the world history took a very weird twist already in 1950s. MGS5 takes place in 1980s, you play as Big Boss, who awakes from a coma after 9 years.\nThe game fits surprisingly well into the timeline, it closes the whole storyline and finally creates one, solid line of a story. The story is complete, finally. From Metal Gear Solid 3 to Metal Gear Solid 4.\nThe gameplay is very repetitive. It almost feels like the game caught an Assassins Creed syndrome. But it's not that bad at all.  It's still one of the best tactical, stealth action games I have ever played.\nThe story is kinda missing from this one. But that was expected because Kojima was very limited towards the end of the game. Second chapter is very unfinished and contains only minority of main missions, rest of the chapters are just recycled mission from chapter 1 which is very sad.\n\nGameplay\nGameplay is very good, responsive and feels just right. Both on the keyboard and a controller. I play my  game on the keyboard and I'm more than happy with it. Easy to control and fun to play.\n\nPerformance\nThis game literally runs on a cardboard box. My game was played on a 2 years old laptop with 4GB ram, i3 and GT740M. Runs more than good, which surprised me the most. This game is very well optimized.\n\nIs it good for new MGS fans\nDefinitely. You are not losing much by starting with this game, if you plan to play other games. It links to the past and to the future simultaneously. You will learn bits from both timelines and you can get to other games later.\n\nFor me this game would be 8/10. Because of q spectacular gameplay, repetitivness and lack of cutscenes and story.","September 23, 2015","true","217.3"," 262 of 361 people (73%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","73","262","361","18","12"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JohnyTroll/recommended/287700/","JohnyTroll","JohnY","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JohnyTroll/","338 products in account","INTRODUCTION\nLet me start off by saying this game is unfinished, a large chunk of the game is missing that contains the originally planned ending and the entire second half of the game is filled with the same exact missions from the first half but with increased difficulty. That's a lot to take at once, now you might ask yourself, what makes it worth buying?\n\nWell, even in this state, the game is a lot of fun to play, having probably THE BEST stealth open world gameplay ever made, you can approach missions in any way you want, either stealth or guns blazing, either call a helicopter for support or snipe from afar, either send your companion in or go in a vehicle or tank, anything is possible in terms of gameplay.\n\nSTORY\nThe main story isn't the greatest ever made, especially if you judge it as an MGS game but it has some preety cool high points made incredible by the 80s soundtrack with tracks like "The Man who Sold the World" by David Bowie and others by great artists like the Oscar winning Ennio Morricone or Donna Burke.\n\nDon't come into this expecting long cutscenes like in MGS 4, the cutscenes are kept to a minimum, apart from a short intro to each mission you just get thrown into the game and you decide how you play. The characters are great and very well voice acted but there's a lack of character development, at least for the side characters.\n\nWhat I found dissapointing was the second half of the game, you can feel the production had to be stopped and missions had to be re-used after Kojima got layed off. This is a terrible decision on Konami's part but thankfully the overall feel of the game wasn't affected. The biggest thing that's missing is a true ending to the game, there's footage of the ending that we were supposed to get on Youtube but instead we get an ok but not great ending, leaving lots of plot-holes and feel that the game isn't finished.\n\nSOUNDS/SOUNDTRACK\nThe soundtrack is some of the best 80s songs you'll ever hear, it won the award for best soundtrack at TGS 2015 but sadly Konami (the publishers of the game) didn't allow the creator of the game, Hideo Kojima, the right to participate the award show and pick up the prize. If you love 80s music, you'll love the soundtrack for this game.\n\nA taste of the incredible soundtrack:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrkzIN2eP0U\n\nThe ambient sounds, even tho not the best, are used preety well to create the feel of a big open world and for the most part work preety well even tho there is certainly room for improvement.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nAs said before, the gameplay is the best stealth open world gameplay ever created, allowing you complete freedom in the way you approach the given situation, the controls are sharp and responsive on both keyboard and mouse and controller. You have a huge variety of guns and customization options numbering in the hundreds as well as a number of companions like D-dog or Quiet who give you a tactical advantage in the field.\n\nThe side missions are high in number but not that much in quality, some of them are really good and feature main characters and cutscenes while the most (around 80%) are repetitive side quests like "Destroy X number of tanks" or "Take out the 2 guards at that location".\n\nGRAPHICS & OPTIMISATION\nThe graphics look good, especially the lightning and reflections look preety realistic, altho you might find some textures lacking since this game also came out on the previous generation of consoles, as well as the foliage not looking that great and lacking Ambient Occlusion.\n\nThe optimisation is  INCREDIBLE . Yea, I had to write that in caps. You can run this on litteraly anything, even a potato plugged to any screen could produce playable framerates. As long as your graphics card supports DX11 (any card from 2010 and later) you will run this game.\n\nONLINE\nThe online mode is ok, not great. It suffers from lots of connection issues, lag and of course, microtransactions (♥♥♥♥ing Konami). This is definitely not the main part of the game and you'll mainly be spending your time in the singleplayer.\n\nLENGTH\nIt took me roughly 55 hrs to finish the game, doing mainly the story missions with quite a few side quests. I had the overall game completion around 60%. I have no doubt that if you want to reach perfect score for all the missions and complete every single side quest on the map you'll put at least 100 hours into this game.\n\nCONCLUSION\nA good final chapter to this series, even tho dissapointing in some aspects, MGS 5 manages to stay fun through it's incredible gameplay and have preety high replay value. The game is unfinished, the story isn't complete, we're missing the true ending that was supposed to be made, but with the current price it's still a very enjoyable experience.\n\nGRAPHICS: 9/10\nSOUND: 8/10\nSOUNDTRACK: 10/10\nGAMEPLAY: 10/10\nSTORY: 6/10\nONLINE: 5/10\n\nOVERALL: 8/10","May 26","true","56.3"," 69 of 76 people (91%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","91","69","76","6","30"

I love this game. First, I wanted to address the "console controls" issue. It does exist, but it's not as bad as you might think:\n\nYes there are some control cues that don't use keyboard mouse - it says use left stick to walk and right stick to look, but you can figure that out. All other control prompts are fine and indicate correct keyboard keys, so don't panic.\n\nNow, the actual game: MGS5:TPP offers a huge amount of freedom, customisation, replayable missions, excellent movies and storytelling, and fun gameplay. The scope of this game is really quite amazing. You can manage and upgrade a base, research hundreds of items, and collect wildlife, plants, resources, vehicles, objects and soldiers to use. Missions allow for multiple entry points, freedom of movement, and let you choose how you want to complete them.\n\nIn true Metal Gear Solid style, the plot, characters, and gameplay are excellent. This is one of the best games I've ever played. Highly recommended!","September 1, 2015","true","78.8"," 142 of 195 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","142","195","3","2"

On its own the game is very fun and addictive but as part of the rich series it belongs to, I can safely say after playing over a hundred hours that this fifth entry does not feel like a Metal Gear game.\n\nThe presentation is where MGS V truly shines. Everything from the graphics to the audio scream AAA quality. It's also a marvel of technical engineering and is the best PC port I’ve ever played. Everything is silky smooth.\n\nGameplay is the best the series has ever had. There are two approaches to most situations, you can opt to go in loud or silently. Both approaches are rewarding in their own right, but stealth feels more refined and is usually the preferred method to complete most objectives. Going guns blazing doesn’t become as viable until you become better equipped and acquainted with the game. In both cases, the AI is superb, ensuring that enemies will react appropriately to your chosen approach and find ways to surprise you.  It’s very challenging, fun, and rewarding for the skilled player. Base management is fairly simple and is one of the aspects that could have been greatly expanded upon. You’ll want to dedicate time--quite literally, as everything takes real world time, from minutes to hours--building up your base and developing technologies in order to unlock new tools, weapons, armors, and companions, which in turn will open more gameplay options.\n\nFor all its strong points however, after a few hours, gameplay does reach a point of diminishing returns. The structure of the missions becomes redundant (destroy this, rescue prisoner there, etc.) and near the end you are forced to replay the same story missions, except with a higher difficulty setting. This is an obvious filler that would have been welcome as an extra feature, not a required one.\n\nThe open world nature of the game means many areas are recycled over and over with only a few fleshed out locations to infiltrate aside from simple guard posts or villages. Also disappointing is the absence of citizens and a general lack of life and activity that is unfortunately coherent throughout the game, including your Mother Base. Sure, you have soldiers wandering around the base and sometimes engaging in frequently repeated banters, but there is a clear lack of interactivity. Mother Base has only one true purpose and it’s to serve as a set piece for cutscenes, which are few and far in-between story missions. This shouldn’t be a dealbreaker, but it does feel like a missed opportunity to create an emotional connection with your soldiers, especially key characters like Ocelot, Miller, your buddies and Big Boss himself. There is none of that.\n\nOn the subject of emotional response, save for one or two scenes, it’s markedly absent throughout the game. The meat for a great plot is there, but there is no narrative to support it. There is virtually no characterization of anyone, except for one buddy’s short story arch. Even listening to the hundreds of minutes of taped recordings will do little in the way of establishing a connection to the characters, nor do a very good job at explaining the motivation of the game's  main villain.\n\nThere's so much wrong with the story of MGS V. Fans of the series have come to accept, even love, the intricate story, unbelievable plot twists, and sometimes cheesy dialogues, but even by Metal Gear standards, MGS V has some amazingly lazy writing. I want to give Kojima the benefit of the doubt given the game was unfinished due to budget and time constraints but even if it had been finished, it’s obvious Kojima has ran out of ideas, overly relying on deus machina moments. It also doesn’t explain the aforementioned lack of characterization. Most importantly, the story fails to accomplish the crucial role this fifth entry was meant to fulfill: explaining Big Boss’s descent into villainy.\n\nSome players don’t deem story to be important, and while I agree it’s not necessary to have a fun game, story is a crucial part of this particular franchise’s DNA. Gameplay was never what made Metal Gear games truly stand apart, it was its attempt at creating gripping story moments. In that respect, MGS V fails miserably.\n\nI'm not recommending the game to MGS fans, unless you're really into stealth games. It doesn't contribute anything to the overarching story. It's mostly meaningless filler. The game is not bad, it's just not a good Metal Gear Solid experience, which is what I was expecting to get out of it, and it's also how I am reviewing it, as a Metal Gear game.\n\nBut hey, I'm still playing it and so it does say something about how fun the gameplay is, but after a few more days I'll be all but done with this game, and seeing as it's very likely the last Metal Gear game, it's a shame the story couldn't meet my expectations. It has been a (mostly) fun ride, Kojima-san and company. Thanks for all the memories.

Hands down.\n\nI know in this buzz-word filled age, you hear the kind of ♥♥♥♥ like 'redefines stealth' all the time. But this really does. I remember reading a review of Theif, one of the older games, where the enemy wasn't coded to know where you are at all times. They spoke of an enemy running three times around the block looking for them, not having any idea he was so close.\n\nAnd I experienced this moment in MGS.\n\nI was sprinting from one place to the next, and not paying attention, I stumbled into a massive base. There were at least twenty soldiers there, and one of them immediately saw me,  and set on an alert. I drew my rifle, dropped the first guard, and then high-tailed it out of there down a road that turned left. On the right was a river, on the left was a cliff.\n\nI ran up the cliff, jumped up some rocks, and then laid flat on this rocky outcropping, hoping the enemy would bypass me entirely. Instead of doing as most videogame enemies do, and making a beeline for me, four guards formed a search party and headed down the road after me. They all stopped at the edge of the river, and started searching it for me while I literally watched from twenty metres behind them.\n\nThey had no clue I was so close.\n\nhttp://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/420313597237781273/372BA30486C6060AF65DAE9B60DF13DE482E7714/\n\nI screenshotted the moment I was so amazed.\n\nAnd your missions are completely open to interpretation.\n\n'Neutralize the spetnaz commander'.\n\nWell, ♥♥♥♥. Does that mean drop an airstrike on him? Creep in past all his men, capping them all in the face as you go, until you get to him, and then stabbing him in the throat in cold blood?\n\nOr does it mean sneak past all the guards, knock out the commander, drag him out onto your horse and shove him onto your extraction helicopter to then become part of your team? Because that's what I did!\n\nDon't like stealth? Bring a rocket launcher! Call in artillery! Call you helicopter in to rain fire and death from the skies! Hell, later on, I think you can call in your own personal armored vehicles! Heavy armor, ♥♥♥♥♥!\n\nWant to do some hybrid ♥♥♥♥? Why the hell not?! Sneak in, quietly take out the guards, plant C4 on their communications equipment and their anti-air defenses, and then blow it all to hell! Then your helicopter can breeze in to a new LZ right in front of you, and pick you up from the enemy base itself!\n\nLike sniping? Sit on a hill two hundred metres away and the enemy won't even know where you are. If you blend in well enough, you can pick them off one-by-one and none of them will be any-the-wiser. I've sat there and listened to Russian commandos desperately calling for backup and search teams to find the sniper that's out there somewhere taking them out.\n\nAnd the best part of all. I saw a research project for much later down the line that lets you fly your prosthetic arm with a little camera.\n\nThat's right.\n\nYou turn your own fist into a ♥♥♥♥ing rocket.\n\nDid you hear that?!\n\nYOU. CAN. HIT. ENEMIES. WITH. A. ROCKET. POWERED. PROSTHETIC. ARM. THAT. YOU. FLY. AROUND.\n\nHow have you not purchased this game yet?!\n\nP.S. Your dog carries a knife.

Since this whole game was about revenge and everyones own phantom pain, I realized that this game gave you it's own phantom pain. That weird hollow feeling you get although you still love playing it, the story just gives you you're own little pain. Now thinking about it that way really changed my feeling about the ending or twist. BUT you can still make the arguement that it still feels unfinished especially since mission 50 is only a youtube video of it's concept.\n-No hard mode because after awhile the game feels less of a challenge, BUT since we're on PC we get MODS!! There just so happens to be a HARDCORE mod on the nexus.\n\nNot too many negatives for me since this game really gave me a bang for my buck, spent $60 and got 80+ hours invested into it.

The story is mostly told with cassette tapes, I look at this as a pro. I understand why people miss the sizable cutscenes because that's something the series is known for.  Story for people who want it.\n\n\n\n\nCons:\n:The final mission of the game was removed and was a very important ending.\n:Rare but got spotted through walls a couple times.\n:If you are shooting a rpg and a bird flys by you, you will die.\n:Reused missions for act 2.

The gameplay is unmatched and a ton of fun, but its plot is very lacking.\n\nIf this were just another game, the plot would be highly acclaimed when being compared to most other games of the same genre; but this is a Metal Gear Solid game. The story is incomplete and does not do what it set out to accomplish. Nearly the entire storyline of V is irrelevant to the rest of the series as a whole. It explains almost nothing that it was created to explain.\n\nIn many ways it will leave a fan of the series feeling his own kind of phantom pain. Metal Gear Solid, to me, has always been half a game and half a movie; this is 90% game with very few cinematic moments compared to it's predecessors. The explanations for many events and lack of logic in the plot has never been this poorly handled before in the series. There are also blatantly stupid design choices.\n\nOne of the most beloved characteristics of the series has been mostly stripped away: cutscenes. The cutscenes that are present are very well done, but much shorter and less frequent than what a fan of the series would be expecting. Many people complained about the amount and length of cutscenes in Guns of the Patriots, but that doesn't mean that most of the story should be fed to the player through cassette tapes and radio communications. Phantom Pain truly is the best title for this game, because it feels like a large part of it was cut away; you can still feel and miss what the game should have been.\n\nWith that said, the gameplay is incredibly well done, very fun and relatively balanced. After a while, missions may become repetitive and dull, but there is almost always something else you can do to improve Diamond Dogs. FOB invasions, while fun, are VERY unbalanced and unfair to the attacker. Defending bases gives you a massively disproportionate advantage over the attacker with minimal risk to yourself. FOB invasions need to be revamped completely.\n\nMetal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is still very much worth the full price and is guaranteed to entertain you for many hours.","September 2, 2015","true","291.4"," 67 of 87 people (77%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","77","67","87","8","0"

Yeah, there's been a pretty decent amount of cut content from what I and others can piece together. The game has two chapters, the first one being titled "Revenge" and the second being titled "Race." Once again, I'm limiting myself here by not trying to spoil anything. But let's just say, the story seems to fall apart and crumble in the latter half. Metal Gear Solid V's story is like a lost sheep trying to carve a path and find its way. In doing so, it doesn't exactly know what it's.... well... doing. I can only lead myself to believe that Kojima and Konami's conflict played a major role in the outcome of the game. If you play through this game and actually attempt to get wrapped up in the lore, you will undoubtedly feel like something's missing. Kojima wanted to hit controversial topics and taboos, but the overall direction, tone, and way the story is set up makes it seem less significant than intended. Certain things were left in as if they were going to have some significance and buildup, and while it seemed as such, they ended up having quite literally no significance at all. I REALLY want to give an example here so I don't have to have a hard time explaining, but... you know... spoilers. Towards the end, plot points are just left in the air, but they're never actually tied up due to cut content (there's an entire mission that was supposed to wrap up a certain plot point, but that was, unsurprisingly, cut from the game.) What's funny is, the cut content that we've managed to find is probably not even all of the cut content that exists. In the end, this game could have been so much more. The ambition is there, the themes are there, the plot points are there... but they're just left hanging. With that said, here's hoping Kojima has better success in the future. Wouldn't want to see his creative talent and potential go to waste. You are the man who trolled the world.\n\nSo why did I give this game a thumbs up? Well... I wish there was a sideways thumb option. If you aren't big on MGS's lore to begin with, or don't play these kinds of games for the story regardless, this is still a fantastic game. The gameplay is superb; controls are honestly as good as you can get in an open-world stealth game. From fultoning soldiers on the field and recruiting them to join your Diamond Dogs PMC to going online and raiding other peoples' Forward Operating Bases, I really am shocked at what this game has to offer in the gameplay department. There's so many different things to do, but I won't go into detail, as I've already said enough probably. Hell, I have just about 100 hours on record as of this review just because I find the gameplay always dragging me back for more. All I can say is, if you can overlook the story and play the game for what it is, this game is AMAZING. However, being a big MGS fan and getting sucked into the lore, this story left me in a bit of pain. Not just any pain. A phantom pain.\n\nIf you already beat the game, I highly suggest checking these videos out. They pretty much sum up my thoughts exactly. (Spoiler alert, of course.)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK7SeYf8zxs\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KO4Tusk_V2k\n\n~~ Metal Gear Online 3 ~~\nI'm a little sad to say that MGO3 falls short of my expectations. While it's an interesting concept, most of the controls from TPP singleplayer don't really translate well over to an environment that's supposed to be competitive. Some aspects have been adjusted for MGO3 specifically such as switching instantly to your cardboard box instead of having to wait for the full animation, but others such as sniper scope swaying and automatically tucking your weapon when you face a piece of cover take away from a competitive feeling. CQC also doesn't work very well; sometimes you can CQC someone from several feet away and other times you can be right next to them and it won't work. It's also worth mentioning that finding matches is completely broken. You can use automatch to automatically find a match, but most of the time, it just disconnects you immediately or puts you in a dead lobby with 1 or 2 people. Finding custom matches is difficult becuase there are usually no rooms, and even if you do find one, custom matches don't give any GP (the MGO3 currency). Finally there's survival, which puts you in a team where you consecutively go through matches with rewards for winning each match. I've only been able to find a few matches, and in a majority of them I either got randomly disconnected or kicked. I also tried playing with friends which also didn't seem to work. One of us set up the room, the other tried to join it and it would just give an error. I could go on and on here, but the point is, MGO3 is heavily flawed for what's supposed to be a competitive experience, and they would have to make  major  changes to keep a viable competitive scene. That's not to say I've had no fun at all with MGO3. The times that I did find good matches were quite a bit of fun, and if you can manage to play with some friends for fun, it can be a pretty enjoyable experience. There's also some pretty neat character customization options and no pay to win elements. But at the end of the day, if you're looking to buy MGSV just for MGO3,  please don't.  It's still fun to pass the time with every now and then. But in it's current state, it's far from what anyone expected and is, in my opinion, the worst iteration of MGO in terms of gameplay and consistency.\n\n-Kinda wish MGO3 was considered a separate Steam game so I could give it a separate review. But for now, I give MGO3 a thumbs down.","September 24, 2015","true","252.9"," 118 of 170 people (69%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","69","118","170","7","10"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ABudiJ/recommended/287700/","ABudiJ","Budi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ABudiJ/","301 products in account","MGSV is an  open world action-adventure stealth game by the series creator Hideo Kojima. It will most likely be the last Metal Gear game he will ever create and also maybe the last Metal Gear videogame ever.\n\nYou play as mercenary leader Punished "Venom" Snake aka Big Boss. The story is placed after the games MGS3: Snake Eater, MGS Peacewalker, MGS: Ground Zeroes and before the original game released on MSX2 platform in 1987, Metal Gear. I don't think it's necessary to be familiar with other games in the series to enjoy Phantom Pain, but ofcourse it helps to piece the whole story together.\n\nGameplay:\n\nFirst time ever, MGS is based in a open world setting. After the introduction/prologue mission you are thrown in the Mother Base which is the heart of your operations to come. You get to expand the base with different platforms by money and resources you get as a reward or gather yourself during missions. You can also dispatch soldiers to go on missions on their own to gain even more money and resources. These soldiers can be recruited during free roam or missions by fultoning unconscious enemy soldiers or saving prisoners of war. So guns blazing with leathal weapons might not be the best option, but it's still an option. Don't forget to interrogate the soldiers either, for locations of prisoners, blueprints and etc. You get to choose how you perform your missions and your perfomance is reviewed by a grade and a codename based on your style. You have plenty of different tools in your disposal like stun grenades, shotguns, decoys, rocket launchers, water pistol and even the classic cardboard boxes that help you to sneak unnoticed! But these items need to be researched and developed in your base first. You start missions by calling in a helicopter to pick you up from Base and then you can choose a mission from the list of main missions or side ops. Or just pick a drop off destination and go roam the world freely doing missions. This is done by using iDroid, hand-sized device Snake carries around. It's your primary tool for base management also and it works as a map. Besides the different weapons and tools you unlock, you also get aided by few followers. Most notably D-Dog, a puppy you can find and raise to be your aid  and sniper called Quiet. Both of them will mark enemies for you so you can see where they are going even through walls. And you can give few simple commands to kill an enemy or make a distraction. But beware, even they might not notice every soldier. The enemy AI is one of the best I have seen, they react in realistic manner to your locations when spotted. If you can change your cover without them noticing they don't magically know where to follow you. But instead keep on firing and searching from the last known location. In firefight enemies also act intelligently, they don't just rush towards you but seek cover and call for back up.\n\nPresentation:\n\nPhantom Pain is running on the Fox Engine created by Hideo Kojima's own studio. It performs really good on PC and is quite remarkable in every way. Game looks really good and has great amount of detail. In cutscenes Snake is seen in the gear you have been wearing on missions, even the possible spilled blood is there. Voice acting is very well done, music composed for the game is great and you also can gather tapes of licensed 80's music from the enemy outposts. You can listen to these tapes on your iDroid. Unfortunaly most of the enviroments are just desert with guard outposts that don't seem much different. I was left hoping for more different locations and especially more missions done mostly indoors. And maybe bit more lively world than just few goats or jackals here and there.\n\nStory:\n\nThis might be the biggest shortcoming of MGSV. Earlier entries in the series are known for their long and frequent cutscenes. There still are cutscenes ofcourse but the lenght and quantity has been greatly reduced. Though too much cutscenes is something that the series has been often criticized for. But at the same time it's been something many of the fans love. Much of the story is now told in tapes you gather by doing missions and you listen to them on your iDroid when you wish. Codec calls as we used to know them are also gone. You can't call different people for discussions anymore and there's no action halting calls coming to your way either. But the problem is just not how the story is told, it doesn't feel very impactful to the continuous story over all the games. It's still as wild and out there as it always has been. And the tone is all over the place, it's up to the player how well he/she thinks the ridiculous comedy and over the top plot mixes  with some quite dark themes. I happen to like it. What I loved was the story and character of Quiet. You get to develop a bond with her,  ingame as your character and even as a player (if you choose to use her on missions). I had my conclusion to Quiet's story after I had beaten the actual main story. And it gave me more satisfying ending for the game.\n\nOverall:\n\nMetal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is a phenomenal game. The gameplay itself is so damn fun with all the different possibilities you can approach the missions, controls feel great and are intuitive with keyboard/mouse or a controller. The lackluster story can't pull the game down. There's also an online portion to the game which I didn't try out at all, so I won't comment on that. The game has 2 chapters, the second chapter was quite dissapointing in it's mission structure. You need to play older missions again with different rule sets to make them harder or grind sideops to unlock more main story missions. I chose to do sidemissions, going to same locations over and over again was bit frustrating. But still the gameplay is just so fun and fluid it didn't bother me that much in the end. While the game is played from 3rd person perspective, shooting can be done through iron sights or scopes in first person.\n\nIt's impossible to go through every cool thing in the game in this review, there's just so much neat stuff to experience. Now go, get the game. Let the legend come back to life.\n\n[Score: 93]","October 24, 2015","true","71.5"," 95 of 137 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","95","137","3","3"

Fox engine is amazing.)\n\n-Keyboard and mouse controls are satisfying.\n\n-2spooky8me, heavy war themes, historical references, 80's music, military acronyms, deep discussions about society and culture. (Young kids really shouldn't play this game. They won't understand a lot. Some things may give them nightmares too.)\n\n-Still has that Metal Gear sense of humour which helps break up all the seriousness. (Look out for the posters.)\n\n-Challenging and rewarding stealth that requires planning. (You can't always go in guns blazing.)\n\n-Impressive weapon gameplay that really affects the outcome of how you play. (bullet drop, realistic reload with chambered ammo, custom attachments etc.)\n\n-True freedom, free to roam and play how you want. (Although the prologue and beginning is linear.)\n\n-Gorgeous environments. (There's several different environments, not just sand.)\n\n-A lot of welcome surprises gameplay and story wise. (I didn't watch any spoilers.)\n\n-PC Dev team has very fast response time and has released patches to improve the game. They really care about the game. (They fixed a major bug with Phenon II CPUs in under 5 hours!)\n\n-Emotional and thought provoking at times. (Things like a prisoner crying because you came to save them, their speech weak because they've been tortured and beaten. It becomes harder to pull the trigger when you eaves drop on enemies and hear that they only took the job to support their children. Sneaking out of a base saving the prisoner and not killing anyone makes you feel like a true hero. When you return to your base everyone salutes you and thanks you for saving them. No other game can offer that feeling.)\n\n\nCons:\n\n-People who didn't play Ground Zeroes may find the controls learning curve a bit steep.\n\n-Menu doesn't have mouse support, navigate with WASD. (I don't mind but I'm guessing that will make some people mad)\n\n-Windows 10 users may have issues. Some people have the game running fine while others not at all. Most people having trouble running the game are using Windows 10. If you are using Windows 10 maybe wait a bit longer. The devs haven't tested it out so officially it's not supported.\n\n\n\nSo I've finished the game and I can say without a doubt that this game is worth playing. People will still be playing this 5 years from now because it is so much fun.

It felt great to finally play in the Afghanistan level from that old E3 trailer, it felt great to hear the line "Let the legend come back to life" from Ocelot and it felt great to test out the many new additions to the game, after almost mastering Ground Zeroes.\n\nBut... unfortunately, while I kept playing the game, I started to feel disappointed in the experience I was getting.\n\nWithout spoiling the "story", I would say that it's the least interesting story to follow among all of the MGS titles, aside from that, it's not even complete and filled with loose plot lines. Out of three chapters of the game, Chapter 2 is a joke and more of a rushed epilogue and Chapter 3 was simply cut from the game.\n\nThe characters are also extremely boring and it's just not interesting to watch them do anything. Skullface who is extremely menacing in his Ground Zeroes tapes and a few TPP tapes, behaves like a clown when he is on screen. Even Ocelot spins his revolvers only once through the entire game and plays the codec guy who is just reminding you that an enemy gunship can cut a man in half (those reused voice clips are so annoying). I won't even start talking about Snake.\n\nThe gameplay itself, while being fun in some aspects is extremely repetitive and 90% of the missions are just a copy of "Extract somebody" missions. The "open world" is dead and nearly every base and literally every enemy checkpoint is the same. Speaking of repetitive action - fultoning enemy soldiers, resources and equipment is an another pointless time waster.\n\nThere are also almost no missions in interiors of buildings. Remember how great was sneaking through Shadow Moses, Big Shell or Groznyj Grad? There is nothing of that caliber here. Even Ground Zeroes has a better base interior than the biggest building (OKB Zero) in this game.\n\nI would also like to add that there is no attention to detail in this game, if you compare to many other MGS games. There are no great boss fights in this game, there isn't any interesting backstory to most of the events that are happening. There aren't even any real guns. Hell, even bottles just vanish with a glass breaking sound when they are shot, when in MGS2 bottles had multiple separate damage points and could break more or less realistically for a PS2 game. Thanks Fox Engine!\n\nOverall it's a fine game in many ways, but it's an awful MGS game and I can't recommend it to anyone, honestly.","October 29, 2015","false","134.4"," 789 of 1,276 people (62%) found this review helpful 82 people found this review funny","62","789","1","82","50"

These cassette tapes should've been cutscenes, and it doesn't need to be 3D animated, it can follow what the other MGS games did by showing drawn art or live footage with music in the background.\nHow Kojima fell so far off from the usual formula is outstanding.\n\nThere's second to no character development whatsoever in this game.\nBarely any dialogue between characters.\nIn previous MGS games you'd have great character development between Snake and the other characters, you see how they transform as the story progresses.\n\nThe game limits your knowledge of the story in many ways, one of them is hearing how the story progresses through audio logs. This isn't really how you build a story driven video game, not at all.\nIf I wanted to hear people talk by choosing from an audio log that's only there to fill in blanks, I'd buy a drama CD and hear the entire story straight.\nNot a video game.\n\nI want to feel a genuine bond between the characters and I feel none of it in MGSV.\n\nOne-sided radio with Kaz and Ocelot during the missions takes away a lot from what made MGS so great. Venom Snake doesn't even interact with them. The cutscenes are mostly there to fill and bear little to no story elements in the game. A huge chunk of the cutscenes take place in Motherbase and shows very little about Venom Snake.\n\nThe only cutscenes that really matter are encounters with Skull Face, the main villain, but even he has barely any development outside cassette tapes.\n\nIn short, we do not know Venom Snake.\n\nThe prologue is just one huge cutscene where you have the most limited controls as they show you how to play the damn game. This is not how an MGS game should start like.\nGround Zeroes did this way better by immediately putting you in the action after an introductory cutscene like the other MGS games.\n\nYou see no interaction with the main female lead in this game, absolutely none.\nOnly a few cutscenes with the mute character and she only talks once in the game.\nZero development whatsoever.\n\nCompare this to all the other MGS games, including Peace Walker.\nYou know them and there's a reason for their relationship with Snake.\nQuiet's only there because you encounter her and defeat her.\nYou don't know her. I don't feel attached to Quiet as I was attached to EVA, Meryl, Paz, Rosemary.\n\nTalking about comparing to other MGS games, let's talk about boss battles.\nThis game has only one boss battle, and it's with the Sehalanthropus, the Metal Gear of this game.\nThis is the only boss battle that made me felt engaged in the game, because of how it was built up in the cutscenes before it. This big monster that strikes fear and you suprisingly easily destroy it.\nYeah. The one memorable boss battle is not constructed in a clever way like the other MGS games, you just shoot and it dies. But at least it felt damn good to destroy it.\nI'm betting half their budget went onto that one boss because all the other "bosses" were pathetic.\n\nYou fight the Parasite Unit three times, and they're just uninteresting because they have zero character. First fight they just appear out of a truck in an airport for no reason. Second fight is against snipers, in the middle of the jungle. The final fight with them is in another airport after a crash from your chopper. They're essentially buffed zombies, and they're easy to fight, just shoot, dodge, and call in for more ammo.\n\nQuiet is easy to defeat, you're literally given an on-screen indication on when to dodge and where Quiet is.\nThe Man on Fire is easy to fight, you just run him over with a jeep over the cliff or wait for him to go blind on you and shoot him down on the pool.\n\nSee where I'm going with this?\nThese bosses are just not memorable.\nThey're forgettable and feel like they're just tacked to suit with the formula.\nYou don't even fight the main villain.\nYeah. The guy who put Venom Snake in a coma for 9 whole years.\n\nDon't get me started with mission briefings/debriefings.\nThey're repetitive as hell and are not skippable. There's no introductory cutscene, nothing.\nJust you in the chopper while being briefed.

I will try to refrain. MGS1 on PSX is very close if not THE favorite game I have ever played. I'm also leaving out anything regarding Konami and Hideo Kojimas relationship.\n\nI feel as though I've spent enough time in between writing this and completing the final missions to say something that errs on the side of objectivity rather than total subjectivity.\n\nThe Metal Gear Solid franchise is some what of a polarizing entity. Not only in action games in general but in being top dog in the stealth genre. Being 1 of the 2 main options between itself and Splinter Cell.\n\nNow if we look at the past, MGS has always been more a cinematic experience than splinter cell while splinter cell was a more action oriented experienced. Not to say MGS didn't have action, moreover that the main draw was the narrative and that of the hours spent playing the game; the majority of those hours were likely cut-scenes and were not derived from gameplay. The tradition has been flipped so to speak.\n\nNARRATIVE\nMGS is built on story; Decades of history, replaying cut-scenes as well as replaying sequences to find hidden Easter eggs therein. Despite my 100+ hours into this game maybe 2 hour of those are cut-scenes and that seems generous. Which honestly make it feel like the least 'Metal Gear' Metal Gear has ever been to date. This is truly the most disappointing aspect of this game for me. From the inside, its a very predictable affair. Based on the time-line we know what happens before and we know what happens after. This game was supposed to elaborate on the details in between. And.. it does but it does it such a way that it may as well be a bullet list told in the most dry manner with zero flavor or perhaps with such a small, discrete flavor it was barely noticeable. No, its not even that concise; Each bullet point is a reward for doing side ops that take a ton of time to do. One tiny cut-scene there, hours of cassettes and repeatable side ops here and a very small cut-scene once again hours later.\n\nAdditionally, the codec system is gone. Its completely removed and seeing as to MGS3 takes place well before this game does it doesn't make a ton of sense that its no longer used. However its clearly a design decision so I don't have much more to say on that. You are rewarded with cassette tapes that you may or may not listen to at your own leisure. Thankfully, the 'important' ones are marked with a yellow color coding tag. It feels strange. I'm not really a fan, It doesn't even really make sense why every one of these conversations were recorded in the first place. But videogames, they don't have to make sense all time. Maybe what I'm saying is I want more talky talk then pressing Q for more intel, even if its not what I'm pointing at.\n\nThere are still secrets to be had but they are far removed from the devastating and unexpected reveals of the past and for what is touted to be THE last in the series I was extremely disappointed in this regard. Now, for someone not in the know and this is their first MGS game. I cannot speak from personal experience but from what I have heard it becomes undecipherable.\n\nWithout specific spoilers, the ending both of them are lackluster. Don't get me wrong they got to me.. but to end a series on this... Its unforgivable in my eyes.\n\nIf you're still reading this I about to talk about some of the good aspects of the game.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nThis game is fun as ♥♥♥♥. It controls phenomenally. The open world is really rewarding to explore. The items that can be researched and developed for use on the battlefield allow for some incredible moments and loadouts can be very diverse for every play style. Both stealth and action wise there are tons of options.\n\nMECHANICS\nWe've established that the game controls well. But lets talk about the systems you interact with. You operate and control a PMC (private military corporation) which you gain followers by liberating outposts (or more accurately gaining heroism) and capturing people with a balloon... okay its based on the real life fulton and there are planes and cables involved but lets be real, in the game, its a balloon. Its sort of like pokemon. You develop binoculars that are attached to a database with information regarding each NPC's skills in certain areas. You capture these people and have them work for you on your Mother Base, the home of the Diamond Dogs.\n\nAs well as capturing humans to work for you with balloons; you also gather vehicles, gun emplacements and resources that are used to further the development of Mother Base as well as develop new weapons, devices and even drugs to improve performance.\n\nThere is also an online component to Mother Base. Using an FOB (forward operating base) you get to have a defensible position that can hold more people and help do more research. However, this FOB as well as others, can be invaded by other real world players. To be honest it feels sort of tacked on. Almost like they said why don't we stick an extra clash of clans-esk game to keep people coming back. I didn't find much enjoyment t from it, it got in the way more than the joy I derived from it.\n\nThe other aspect of your base involves 'Dispatch missions' which involve sending your soldiers out to complete tasks. You've seen this before. Risk evaluation and rewards for a given time of completion.\n\nGRIEVANCES\nThe side ops feel superfluous, they aren't bad they're just tedious. You have to do too many in order to maintain GMP and resources for weapon research as well as base expansion. Also some of them are labeled 'important' and are very much involved with the narrative which leads me to believe they were mislabeled to begin with.\n\nThe side ops take place in the exact same locations with only slight variables being exchanged. Additionally, some 'main' missions took less time than side ops.\n\nTroy Baker will never be Ocelot in my eyes.\n\nThe way the game ends,eh hem , THAT ending not the Chapter 1 ending  just seems lazy and very unsatisfying.\n\nTHE GIST\nNow, why a positive recommendation after saying all this bad stuff about it? Because its really fun and even if you've no idea who Frank Jaegar is and 'frankly' give don't a ♥♥♥♥. You'll still really enjoy playing this game. I just honestly hope, and this is a love letter... do not let it end this way.\n\nI guess we still have MGO to look forward to in January..","November 23, 2015","true","107.1"," 59 of 81 people (73%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","73","59","81","4","3"

After this extensive collection of quick time events comes to an end, the game finally kicks off, with Big Boss, or Venomous Snake, or whatever the hell he's called now, teaming up with Revolver Ocelot and Kaz Miller to rebuild the Diamond Dogs Mother Base.\n\nThis involves carrying out all manner of stealth missions in Afghanistan and eventually Africa, as you collect resources, brainwash soldiers to work for you and unlock and produce all manner of weapons and gadgets to use in the field.\n\nThere's really just too many features to list and the amount of options left up to the player can be staggering at times. For instance, the way night and day can affect enemy placement and visibility during missions. The way you can use sandstorms to cover your tracks and become practically invisible. You can even drop supply crates on an enemies head purposefully to knock them out.\n\nIn terms of an open world stealth game, it let's you control and modify just countless parameters of the game world and really does just give you limitless ways to do whatever you want, whenever you want, however you want. It's truly unsurpassed in that regard.\n\nIt is overall a great game, though at times, just not a great Metal Gear Solid game.\n\nFull video review:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcYi_67xfho&feature=youtu.be","September 6, 2015","true","67.0"," 71 of 102 people (70%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","70","71","102","8","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kirtanloorii/recommended/287700/","kirtanloorii","kirtanloorii","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kirtanloorii/","237 products in account","INTRODUCTION After 3+ long years of waiting,  Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain	 is finally released. I was there for all of the news updates, all of Kojima's tweets and every good discussion among the Metal Gear Solid fan community. I felt light as a feather the moment I was able to download this game on steam. From the "Garbage" trailer, to "Red Band," "Nuclear" and finally "Elegia," my hype levels were through the roof. Was this game worth the wait? Was it worth the hype?\n\nFIRST IMPRESSIONS I was so excited just being able to see the loading screen after I started the game for the first time. I always wondered what the main menu looked like. You see, this game was shrouded in mystery for a very long time. Information was released in such a cryptic way that you constantly wanted to know more. I was met with a very good intro movie featuring the song "The Man Who Sold the World." And then I got to play the notorious "Hospital" chapter. It was very cinematic, interesting and left me with so many questions. I escaped with Ocelot and he sent me on my first mission to rescue Kaz Miller (none of this is a spoiler because it was all in the trailers). After doing so, we returned to Mother Base, and that's when the real game began.\n\nSTORY AND GAME PROGRESSIONI have always known this game was going to feature a quieter Snake. Kojima said so himself and even the previewers confirmed this. But I was alarmed to see just how quiet Snake really was. He was so silent in this game, and if you think about it, Snake has always been the one with the most lines in all other Metal Gear Solid games. The story just felt foreign and unusual with a quieter Snake.\n\nAfter Snake is given control of Mother Base, you are tasked with simply building it up. In the next several missions you begin completing jobs for unknown "clients." The reward is money. Several hours will go by before you see another cutscene. You will get a small one (which was completely spoiled by Konami) after you find DD (Diamond Dog).\n\nWhen the story does begin to pick up (30+ hours into the game), it's a handful of tiny cutscenes. Roughly 80-90% of the story takes place on cassette tapes that are given to you after missions. It doesn't sound so bad, until you realize that another 80-90% of all dialogue is either Kaz, Ocelot or Code Talker. One of the most interesting characters in the game, Quiet, is unable to speak, so she is mostly invisible the entire game.\n\nIn order to progress through the story, you have to complete all main missions as they become available. However, some of those mission will not become available until you visit Mother Base and then return to your helicopter. There are other essential missions that will not become available until you build Mother Base up to a certain level, or improve relations with a certain "buddy." The game does not tell you this. It just leaves you hanging.\n\nAnother thing that is sure to throw people off is the fact that the game has more than one ending. The first time I saw the credits rolling, I was fuming. I almost punched my monitor because the "ending" was so bad. Then it introduces you to the next chapter of the story. Some might call this a spoiler, but I wish someone told me this before I played the game.\n\nAfter finishing the first chapter, the game allows you to replay older missions with more challenging configurations. But these are included as new missions on your mission list. If you are reading this, don't worry about that. You don't have to do them all in order to progress the story. You only need to do one at a time to move on in the story. Do the one mission you can manage and then the new story related mission will pop up. I don't want to say how many endings there are, but know this: Every Metal Gear Solid game ends with a picture of the game logo and a secret conversation. Every one. So if you have not seen this yet, then you have not finished the story.\n\nGAMEPLAY This is by far the heart and soul of the game. Metal Gear Solid V is all about the gameplay. You have the main story missions, side ops, resource gathering and the Mother Base management system. To sum it up, you need to complete the main missions. However, you might not have the tools to do so. So the solution is to recruit enemy soldiers into your ranks via the fulton extraction system (balloon with a hook). Basically, you kidnap them and make them like you. Then they will get to work. Mother Base is made up of the Command Platform (just a useless stage for some cutscenes to happen), Medical Platform (treats injured soldiers), Intel Platform (tells you about the weather and nearby enemy locations), Combat Platform (can be deployed to combat zones to make you money and gather supplies) R&D Platform (these guys make the weapons you use), Support Platform (they send you items in the field if you request it) and finally the Mother Base Development Platform (they build Mother Base and mine resources). There is also the Security Platform that is eventually introduced to defend your FOB's in the forced multiplayer mode.\n\nOnce you have enough staff on these platforms, they can begin to support you in many ways. Some missions cannot be completed if you have not yet recruited someone or developed something. I actually had to idle for 20 minutes on a mission once because I was waiting for R&D to finish developing something I needed to complete the mission. While the Mother Base system adds tons of hours to the game, in the end I did not like it. It felt forced and if anything, it serves as a distraction. And if you connect to the Konami servers, other players can actually invade your base and steal your resources and people. If you play offline, they can still steal your stuff. You just won't know it until you connect again to the Konami server. If you truly want to avoid this, either don't agree to the TOS to use Konami's servers, or block MGSVTPP via Windows Firewall.\n\nCONCLUSION How do I say this? I loved this game, and hated it at the same time. On one hand, the gameplay was excellent. It was exactly what they said it would be, and the gameplay trailers showed the game as it truly is. But the story was (almost) complete garbage. Nanomachines were replaced with parasites. Snake was WAY too quiet. Quiet lived up to her name. Kaz has a stick up his ♥♥♥ the whole time, and Ocelot as plain as it gets. Everyone had only one emotion at all times. Characters did not grow or change in any way (except for one, but no spoilers). The story trailers were VERY misleading and made it seem like an entirely different game. They were cleverly edited to make the story seem better than it actually was, and the ending is sure to anger MANY people. Not me, but I know that people are going to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off.\n\nVERDICT So, do I recommend this game? Yes I do recommend this  GAME . As a game, it is legendary. It will keep you busy for so long, but perhaps not too long. I thought this game was going to launch with MGO3, but now we have to wait until January, which is way too far for many people. Does this game deserve all the 10's? *sigh* No, it does not. I love the gameplay, but the lack of a good story (something I consider a reward) is enough to bring this game down a few points. I have always loved Metal Gear Solid gameplay, but for me, lore is king, and absent in this game. Also, the game is so big, that it actually reduces replay value for me. Replaying missions feels like a waste of time because I have side ops to do. And the nonexistent story means that the main missions are really just glorified side ops.\n\nGameplay: 9\nStory:         3\nGraphics:   9\nMusic:        8 (Not counting tapes.

The game is polished to holy hell and there are a lot of mechanics and video-gamey toys at your disposal.\n\nIf you're looking for a worthwhile intellectual experience (a.k.a. you're looking for a MGS game, or you're looking for the game advertised in those outstanding E3 trailers), then you certainly won't like it. Primarily, your discontent will take the forms of disappointment and heartbreak. Here's why:\n\n1. Skull Face is the least threatening, most shallow villain in the whole franchise. He has a dastardly plan, but there's almost no idealism to it--he's just angry and greedy. Most of the franchise's other villains are capable of bringing the player on board with their plan at least partially. Never the case with Skull Face.\n\n2. Big Boss barely ever talks\n\n3. Storytelling boils down to a few, short pretty cool cutscenes, a ton of audio cassettes that should have been cutscenes, and a pair of core-characters-turned-emotionless-carboard-boxes talking mission objectives at you.\n\n4. The first hour promises everything you'd expect from a MGS: paranormal activity, weird coincidences, ambiguity and lots and lots of questions. The rest of the game forgets the intro ever happened. The man on fire, for example, is explained in a hasty oh-by-the-way epilogue mission that has you sneaking into a certain base for maybe the 4th or 5th time. His closure plays out like a writer  only remembered he was part of the story the night before the game was due.\n\n5. Technically, there are 50 main missions. But they're main missions only insomuch as they let Konami talk about 50 main missions in press briefings. Really, there are 31 story missions, 6 or so scatter-brained epilogue missions, and 12 or so challenge missions, which are simply early game missions replayed with tougher constraints and no additional story.\n\n6. The story gives you almost no ideas to ponder after it's done. MGS1 inspires a discussion of the role of genes in destiny. MGS2 inspires a discussion of the impact of information control on human agency. MGS3 inspires a discussion around the nature of a hero, and the nature of the greatest asset one can sacrifice (one idea the game proposes is that sacrificing one's legacy for the greater good is the most heroic act possible). I didn't play MGS4, so I can't comment on that one. MGSV inspires discussions called "But, but, but the GAMEPLAY WAS SO GOOD!" If you really think about the plot, maybe you'll say to yourself "So, about that Lingua Franca..." but that will be it, because the story barely even investigates the surface of a Lingua Franca debate.\n\n7. Everything you saw in the trailers that excited you about how dark this game might be misled you. Every time one of those scenes play out, you realise that if the trailer had let them play out for 2 more seconds, they would have portrayed something much more mundane and much less consequential. The game's tone is much lighter than the marketing suggests.\n\nSo don't play this game. It's a waste of time. Well, I guess play it if you're looking for a fun waste of time.","October 16, 2015","false","76.8"," 208 of 332 people (63%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","63","208","332","13","11"

BE WARNED THAT THIS REVIEW WILL HAVE MAJOR SPOILERS!\n\nAfter finishing the game's story and spending a considerable time in the game its time I made this review. I really enjoy this game. From the 7 year old child in me who was blown away from the first Metal Gear Solid game in the Playstation due to its amazing story and gameplay to the 15 year old I am now who still plays the series to this day. So I'm going to be honest with this review and be strict with the game on this review because it a game series that is very near and dear to me.\n\nSUMMARY:\nThe game takes place after the events of Metal Gear Solid : Ground Zeros, where there was a nuclear detonation of a bomb, destroying the old Mother Base of FOXHOUND and in the process Severly injuring Punished "Venom" Snake, -or well known as Big Boss- sending him in a coma. After 9 years Big Boss wakes up and is hellbent on revenge for the events of 9 years ago. His goal is to find and kill SkullFace. In order to do this he forms a private military organisation called "DIAMOND DOGS", a successor to FOXHOUND, in order to carry out this duty.\n\nSTORY:\nThe story is amazing. The plot is strong and satisfying. I really don't know how clear i can get besides that.\nHowever, the ending few of the game feels very shallow and "missing". With some plot holes and a rather unsatisfying conclusion that leaves you starving for more.\n\nThe "TRUTH" ending was a total mindf**k but ended it pretty dissapointed. By far my favourite ending was Quiet's. Because it gave, "somewhat" of satisfaction.\n\nI'm not kidding, i literally didn't know that the game had ended until i googled after a few hours waiting for my next mission to arrive.  I assumed there was more as there is a credit sequence after every mission and I didnt know that the game had ended. Because of the way the game had ended I thought there were more to come. But unfortunately, no.\n\nCHARACTERS:\nHonestly, even though the characters are great. But they were hugely wasted, in my opinion. Snake BARELY f**king talks most of the time in cutscenes he is eeriely silent, and if you're lucky he may utter ONE sentence/word. The voice actor for Big Boss is Keifer Sutherland. Whom you may know from the Television series "24". Its dissapointing that a person of such skill was just wasted here.\n\nRevolver Ocelot doesn't even do his awesome revolver tricks besides at one point in the game. Yes, this is a weird thing to start off with in Ocelot. But my inner 7 year old was hungry to see him do those tricks as he did in Operation Snake eater.\n\nThere is a colourful cast of villans here:\n\nThe man on fire, who is actually the Bisexual villan "Volgin" from Operation Snake Eater. He is just there to get revenge on Big Boss for foiling his plans on building a Utopia in Operation Snake Eater. He is pretty much a body guard to SkullFace. Thats pretty much it....\n\nAnd of course. Psyco Mantis, the main villan from Metal Gear Solid 1. The very villan that changed the course of gaming and wowed many gamers around the world due to his smart boss fight where he'd f**k with your mind, invert controls, start reading your Playstation memory card and force you to switch controllers in order to beat him.\nAgain, none of that charm is here. Now bear in mind that Psyco Mantis is very young in this game because it takes place before the events of MGS1.\n\nQuiet, surprisingly created a strong bond with the gamer. She is literally silent in the game but some how does a great job at bonding. Kojima magic right there. But im not going to deny that she isn't basically PURE fan service.\nThe reason she is so "revealing" is that she breaths through her skin, not her lungs and if she wore any clothes it would suffocate her.\nYeah... Oh, don't worry. I'm not complainig one bit ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nMGS5 provides a fluid arsenal of weapons and vehicles. Letting you play the you want. Stealth through at the night/ morning or dash in with a rocket launcher and murder everone in sight.\nYour choice.\n\nThere are plenty of Side missions (Side-Ops), that could vary from saving your lost crew from FOXHOUND or from settling a simple job. However, deep into the game this can get very repetitive. As it kind of becomes the same thing ,over and over again. Either Fulton extract this individual again or kill this individual again.\n\nAnd of course, the Fulton Extraction system bought over from Metal Gear Solid : Peace Walker (PSP (Playstation Portable). What this is that it allows you to extract vehicles, weaponry, raw material containers and personell with special skills to add to your private military force DIAMOND DOGS.\n\nThe game has many mechanics as well. Working for both your advantage and disadvantage.\n\n-Rain : Silences your footsteps. allowing you to walk freely without the risk of enemies hearing you. But this is the case for you as well.\n\n-Sandstorms : Ghastly reduces the vision of enemies. Making them harder to spot you. Making it easier to dash through the base/ mission. However this is the case for you as well. You will not be able to see clearly and it you will be unable to mark enemies.\n\n-etc.\n\nThe game expects you to grasp these mechanics and lets you work accordingly to its rules. It creates a strong and lively world in which to play. This can be challenging. How will you play?\n\nFOB INFILTRATIONS AND DEFENCES :\nWhat this is, is it basically allows you to infiltrate other people's online FOB (Forward Operating Bases) and capture their arsenels and soilders. Its kind of a mini-game. I don't know much about it as i haven't really played it alot.\n\nMETAL GEAR ONLINE:\nBasically the multiplayer of Metal Gear Solid 5. Nothing much else. There are many game modes to play and many character classes to choose from in order to play the match the way you want.\nOne of my main issue with this multiplayer mode is that it has quite alot of hackers and the weapons don't feel very satisfying.\nI don't care how strong you tell me Ocelot's Revolvers are, game. It feels like im shooting butter at the enemies.\n\nVERDICT:\nMetal Gear Solid 5 gets a 9/10.\nThe reason it is missing its last point is due to the unsatisfying conclusion and and poor character developments.\nAnd a supposed 4th ending! unfortunately this was unfinished because of the incident with Kojima and Konami. I can't help but feel the game is unfinished in many places.\nOverall, to those who is new to this franchise or is familiar with it, like I am. This game is a MUST BUY.\nIts a masterpeice. A game that will be held on the top shelf of many passionate gamers.\n\n---NOTE___\n\nI hope you enjoyed this review and if it helped you decide whether to purchase this game. If you have any questions and/or want to correct me in places, please don't hesitate to leave a comment.\nThank You,\n-XALE","May 10","true","92.2"," 48 of 66 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","48","66","3","10"

All these hours I have in the game I truly played and enjoyed.\n\nHowever...\n\nYou can literally pinpoint the moment in development when Kojima ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off Konami and exhausted their patience, resulting in them stepping in and pushing this game out of the door.\n\n- Many loose strands, gameplay and story wise. Mysteries and plot points that go nowhere and gameplay features like a battle gear tank that was supposed to be playable but isn't.\n- Story that trips all over itself, with a completely recycled and practically non-existent second chapter.\n- Woefully under-used Kiefer Sutherland and no character development for most of the cast of characters.\n\n- Most of the story and character development is buried in a section of your menu for audio logs/cassette tapes. Even major plot points are relegated to audio logs.\n- A selection of audio logs stand out with much higher production values than the others, with 3D sound and environmental sound design as well as better voice acting, all which point towards initial plans to make them into fully fleged cutscenes.\n\n- Game continues after the credits roll. At this point, motivationally speaking in terms of story and resources, you have no motivation to continue playing. I couldn't bring myself to complete the last few missions (which are for the most part literal repetitions of previous missions but with stricter objectives like no supply drops).\n\n\nI have no doubt that if Kojima and his team were given another year to realize their vision, this game wouldn't leave such a sour taste. As it stands, all that is left is A Phantom Pain...\n\n\n\nStill recommended.","October 18, 2015","true","222.4"," 56 of 81 people (69%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","69","56","81","4","0"

Fantastic gameplay but the story left so much to be desired it's not even funny. The entire thing feels like a massive copout. Don't read ahead if you don't wanna be spoiled. I absolutely cannot understand the logic to fake Big Boss's identity and have us create a senseless mother base within a story full of dull characters rather than just having made the game everyone wanted: Play as big boss in zanzibarland, building Outer Heaven, rescuing gray fox, finding Naomi, and bringing all the classic characters back and letting us ride in the front seat watching as Big Boss descends into madness as the iconic villain he was portrayed as in future titles. WHY KOJIMA WHY.\n\n9.5/10 gameplay\n4/10 story\n\nIt absolutely astounds me as to how well edited the trailers for this game were. They made it seem so much better than it actually was and actually made it seem like the game would be pushing the boundaries it promised to push. It almost makes me feel as if though Kojima wanted to end this with a whimper and not a bang, he wanted to show, through this game, with it's ridiculous TV based episodic missions, that he was and has always been made to work in a different field. Kojima can undoubtedly make some fantastic trailers and some fantastic games. I loved Metal Gear Solid 1-3 and the retro titles, but since then something has happened and it's a truly sad state of affairs for many fans of the franchise.\n\nPlease let Ingsoc.org amount to something....it probably won't...but here's to you.....Niccola and Bart..","September 11, 2015","false","107.6"," 130 of 208 people (63%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","63","130","208","6","26"

Really appreciate how the way ranking works and the side-ops are done encourage you to experiment with all of your options.\n\n*Lots of really powerful and well-done scenes in the game. Shows that Kojima's still capable of pulling of character moments when it really counts.\n\n*Was worried before release that Kojima’s brand of weird, quirky humor would clash with the dark content he intended to cover, but overall it was handled fairly well for the most part.\n\n*VA is top-notch, for the most part. Had a lot of apprehensions about Keifer in this, but he really pulled the whole thing off.\n\n*Lots of easter eggs and little tidbits for old fans of the series, really appreciated that.\n\n\nThe Bad:\n\n*Both main missions and side-ops get pretty formulaic pretty quickly, and there are a lot of both. Really feel that they could’ve experimented more with them, but save for a few exceptions, they get fairly samey fairly quickly, though as I said, you can get plenty of replay value out of them if you’re the type to experiment with how to do things.\n\n*Codec conversations have been on the decline since MGS4, so I’m not all that surprised that they’ve been removed from this game. Still sad to see them go for good.\n\n*The game moves slowly where it really shouldn’t have to. Having to manually call in a helicopter, find a helipad, get on board the chopper, and wait for its 20 or so second liftoff just to accept a mission because the game won’t let you do it from the base itself is an unnecessary chore. Not even going into the unnecessary, plot-spoiling character credits that come up at the start of every bloody mission.\n\n*The AI’s pretty wonky at times. It’s able to do the most important stuff, so it’s not completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but there are a lot of holes in it that are fairly easy to exploit.\n\n*Quiet utterly trivializes the game. Short on MB Staff? Give her the tranq rifle and watch with amazement as she clears out entire bases of A+, leaving you to just mop things up afterwards, kidnap all the stationed soldiers, and steal everything that isn’t nailed down. Need to extract a prisoner? Give her the regular rifle (or the maxed penetration rifle if you’re near end-game and facing exclusively armored enemies), and tell her to fire at will, leaving you an opening to just strut in the base and get the guy out while all the enemy sentries are focused on her.\nShow Spoiler\n\n*That ♥♥♥♥ing jeep scene. Two middle aged men sitting in the back seat of a car with the idle animation of one of them making it look like he’s desperately trying to ignore the other, with inappropriately bombastic music plays in the background. 10/10, best representation of an awkward car ride with your step-dad ever.\n\n\nThe Ugly\n\n*The story is an utter ♥♥♥♥ing mess. I didn't even think it was possible, but it manages to be even worse than MGS4. Broadly speaking, the first chapter of the game is tedious, poorly paced, lacking proper exposition (I’ll get to this again later), and with a shallow villain  who’s goals and actions are only fleshed out after he’s already dead, in optional side-content .The second chapter is basically just a series of epilogues that have great individual moments, but has no real overarching story to link any of them together, with one being left as a pretty huge dangling plot thread, so at best they just feel…random. A lot of the character-specific content of the second chapter could’ve easily been made part of the first chapter, and it would’ve left both parts of the game stronger for it.\n\nYes, I know that the second half was supposed to be resolved and the mission for it was cut, but I can’t give kudos to Kojima for something that ultimately still isn’t in the final game. The final mission isn’t even really an ending, it’s just another plot twist that doesn’t act to tie the whole game up or anything.\n\n* I’ll admit, the codec conversations and cutscenes in the prior games were a clumsy way to handle exposition, often resulting in 10-15+ minutes made up of nothing but floating heads talking to one another about ♥♥♥♥ necessary to make the plot progress, but holy ♥♥♥♥ is it better than forcing the player to go on binge-listens through mountains of optional audio cassette tapes if they want to understand exactly what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on.\n\n*If you hated base-building in Peace Walker, then congratulations, because you’re gonna re-live that hatred all over again here! Only real consolation is that staff morale is basically a non-issue now, so you don't have to worry about maintaining a ♥♥♥♥ing cafeteria anymore.\n\n*Basically all the new characters in the game bar Quiet are pretty boring. Skull-Face had the potential to be a proto-Solidus, but his plan is too nonsensical to really take seriously and not enough time is really given to him in the actual game (Re: not in cassette tapes only released after he’s already dead) that he’s really just a waste. Code-Talker’s just dull, really no other way to tell it.\n\n*The whole ‘men become demons’ thing is really a great big marketing lie. Big Boss never goes over the deep end in the game, and with Miller,  The worst he really does in the game is to Huey, who is later revealed to be guilty of nearly everything he was accused of and is essentially one of the most despicable, cowardly characters in the whole series, and Quiet, who is eventually revealed to have been exactly what he accused her of, and the only reason she didn’t wipe them all out is because she fell in love with Big Boss . Other than that, he’s arguably as moral as ever, he’s just a grumpy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ now instead. Miller has his big spiel about how they’re gonna shove their noses in bloody battlefield dirt and how they’re gonna play every dirty trick in the book and how they’re gonna become damned forever in their drive for revenge, and here’s the grand total of what they do in the game:\n\n· Rescue POW’s\n\n· Aid the Mujahedeen against the Soviets,  who’re building a nuclear apocalypse machine\n\n·  Save child soldiers and try to reintegrate them into society by giving them a home and free education\n\n·  Save the world from a parasite that would’ve killed billions of people\n\n·  Saved the world from a nuclear apocalypse\n\n·  Murder a man who planned to kill billions and control the world via magic nanomachine shenanigans\n\n· Try to make the perfect burger\n\nYeah, real turn to the dark side, there.\n\n*A majority of the missions in Chapter 2 are rehashes of the levels from the first chapter. Not DMC4 “same levels, but with different cutscenes and character”, it’s literally the same level with upgraded enemies and modifiers attached. While admittedly some of the modifiers are interesting (for instance, the SUBSISTENCE modifier, which forces you to procure all your equipment on-site), the most commonly used one is the EXTREME modifier, which just buffs the damage of all the enemies because ♥♥♥♥ you. The second chapter of the game overall feels fundamentally unfinished gameplay wise as well as story-wise.\n\n\n* BS retcon non-ending that just raises more questions than it answers.\n\nIn conclusion, whether or not you'll like the game depends on whether or not you're in it for the gameplay, or for the story. Because the former is great, while the latter is a trainwreck. As I'm a long time fan of the series who was looking forward to the story for this one. I was left sorely disappointed, so I can't bring myself to recommend it to other fans of the franchise.","September 15, 2015","false","68.3"," 93 of 145 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","93","145","0","0"

THIS IS NOT A NEGATIVE REVIEW FOR THE SAKE OF HATING ON KONAMI!\nIt hurts me to write this review but it has to be done.\n\nSo, I would like to begin by saying that my initial review was  extremely  positive of this game. My hype was still extremely high and it was an unbelievable relief to finally have the wait over with. I had my hands on The Phantom Pain, oh boy, was I excited? Everyone was, it was extremely anticipated and nobody could wait to get into it.\n\nAll was well, the story and characters were gripping, the new mechanics were fun and I kept progressing at a steady pace with a fair mixture of main missions, side missions, upgrading Mother Base and so on. The game in itself is enjoyable and it's an extremely well made stealth game, It's a Metal Gear game for Christ sake. The gameplay is good and the story is good... That is... Up until around halfway through chapter 2.\n\nUp until this point everything has been going well, I was deeply enthralled on the way the story was going, things were going great and the missions kept offering me a unique change every time. Then the copying happened. The exact same missions, the exact same objectives in the exact same locations but you either can't be detected or it's game over, or it's extremely hard difficulty.\n\nAlright, it didn't bother me too much to be completely honest, I just wanted to progress further into the game. So I finish all these hard-♥♥♥ missions finally, expecting to get another cut-scene or a mission.\n\nNothing. I was given nothing.\n\nThe story came to an end without me even knowing it. It just went away at an abrupt end I didn't even know was there. What the living ♥♥♥♥? A game series I love with all my heart, the grand finale, Kojima's masterpiece to finish the series? Tough luck.\n\nI'm not blaming Kojima and his team, it's probably Konami having slashed the funding and what-not but to leave the game unfinished like it is. It breaks my heart that it's left this way. From the bottom of my heart it hurts me to write this review but I cannot recommend this game to a fan of the series.\n\nEDIT: Also like to add that I did witness the 'ending' and my God the plot twist was like something out of a 80s movie trying to be clever. It wasn't. It made no sense and left a ton of plot holes in the story, it felt cheap and just cheesy right to the core and wasn't satisfying at all. I wish it just left with that abrupt end...\n\n"Why do we keep playing? Just to suffer? The story I've lost. The gameplay I've lost... It won't stop hurting..." :Miller:","September 6, 2015","false","88.9"," 274 of 459 people (60%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","60","274","459","15","11"

Now you search for a weak point in their defense, a path where are less soldiers, you have D-Dog with you, so he can sniff out any enemy that you missed earlier, you hide in shadows, you walk slowly, and prone in the grass so they wouldn't see you, you get closer to the highly skilled enemies you want to take with you, you use a non-lethal pistol that will put them to sleep, once you take the body to a further place, you fulton it up to a heli, that will bring him back to Mother Base, you find your target neutralize him and fulton him to Mother Base OR you just go in with artillery strikes, gunship support while you ride a tank :D that's the beauty of it, the freedom which this game gives you is unprecedented...\n\ncons:\n- sometimes the AI is bugged when they try to climb a ladder\n- I really have nothing else, so far\n- cut-scenes are a bit far off considering its amount in previous games, but this is understandable since this is an open-world game\n\nwill finish the review, once I finish the game","September 5, 2015","true","121.4"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","88","23","26","6","2"

Characters are shallow and empty; the story is a collection of memes that go nowhere; game is obviously unfinished (aside from cut content, it was rushed through QA and is riddled with misspellings, wrong subtitles, and wrong tape release order).\n\nMGO was a disaster.  I say was because I abandoned it almost immediately.  FOB was pretty addictive; but after many hours of play, I ended up quitting that mode.  I just reset my points to 0 and quit playing.  It's not bad, but just the same thing over and over.  All in all, I have over a thousand hours in the title.  That's a testament to the overall game play.\n\nOver 100 different weapons, all kinds of interesting equipment and freedom to complete missions any way you want.  It works really really well and I can't overstate how fun it is to re-do missions in various styles.  Bottom line, if you ignore the story and the Metal Gear skin, the game is fun to play.  If you're looking for that Metal Gear flavor of previous titles, you'll be a bit disappointed like me.","May 2","true","202.4"," 36 of 49 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","36","49","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mahodo/recommended/287700/","mahodo","General Lee Aroused","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mahodo/","1002 products in account","The latest and more than likely the last canon game of the Metal Gear Solid series, Phantom Pain is chronologically the fourth game in the complicated cinematic sneaking espionage Hideo Kojima game timeline. This is by far the best Metal Gear Solid game I've played up to date gameplay wise and one of the competitors for GOTY, but there's just one thing...this doesn't feel like a Metal Gear Solid game. Its a bit complicated, but I'll try to go over it. While yes, the name is definitely a mothership Metal Gear Solid game and it was created by Kojima, but this one is a bit different, but not in a bad way. Its more of an open world sneaking game than a Metal Gear Solid game, something where those two statements should be synonymous but its not.\n\nPROS\n- The first in its series to be an open world game, and by god, is it big. They weren't kidding when they said the total size of the game's playable map is 200 times bigger than Camp Omega. You better fulton out some vehicles because travelling by foot (or cardboard box sledding, whichever) is not a good way for old Big Boss to get around.\n- Amazingly well optimized for PC, something I was initially fearful of as Japanaese developers don't have much focus on PC gaming due to the nature of console/handheld gaming being more prolific in their home country.\n- The Fox Engine brings out one of the most beautiful and graphically impressive games I've seen this year.\n- A stealth game that has amazingly reactive AI that perfectly creates a believable situation, so you can sleuth properly without calling ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t on the game cheating you. Take that, Thief 4.\n- Multiple approaches to missions that can greatly extend replayability. And hey, even if you suck at stealth, the game doesn't punish you as much if you went in guns blazing. In fact, it feels just as incredibly fun and a great rush to improvise on the fly.\n- A large R&D development line that allows you customize your loadout for each mission. The detail of weaponary was always something Big Boss was a fan of (he goes on about a single custom pistol for about 8 minutes in Snake Eater. AMAZINGLY INTERESTING INDEPTH BUT USELESS GUN TRIVIA), so its only natural that he has about, oh, only over 25 guns to choose from. And we're not even counting customization, gadgets, and support he can call from his army of Diamond Dogs.\n- The buddy system is one of the greatest things to be introduced in the Metal Gear series, allowing an even greater tactical approach to each situation. Unfortunately, the most useful two companions are optional and can be missed entirely. YOU BETTER FIND THEM.\n- Enemies adapt to your strategies if you employ them too often. Lots of casualties from headshots? They'll start wearing helmets. Always attack the site at night? They'll start bringing in flashlights, night vision goggles, and gunships with searchlights. A fan of taking an interesting way around or just love vehicular slaughter? They'll start laying down landmines. Chemical warfare via gas? Gas masks. Bodyshots? Body and riot armour. Frontual assault? Shields. And the list goes on, so make sure to mix it up and adapt to them trying to adapt to you. And, uh, adapt.\n- Interesting story that brings back old characters in a story for revenge that make the little Metal Gear Solid fangirl in me scream. I always liked Kazuhira Miller and having him tell me over and over again that iDroid doesn't stop time while in the menu. Yes, Kaz, I know, shut up, I love you, but just shut up. I don't care if the anti-air radar wasn't the target, I just want air support.\n- While the story is especially painting a vengeful line, that doesn't mean its all serious and no fun. The Metal Gear series has always had a light hearted and often humourous world. Such as having the ability to command your horse to poop. But guess what, that poop can be used strategically! For example, if an enemy vehicle drives over it, they'll spin out of contorl and crash. Or if you put a poster of a pinup girl on your cardboard box and let an enemy male solider see it, they'll immediately rush over, drop their weapons, and oogle at it, a perfect chance to take the guy out.\n- An amazingly large amount of little details that you wouldn't think much of that can be so impactful. Think outside the box!\n\nCONS\n- The voice acting of Big Boss is pretty weak, especially considering Kiefer Sutherland of the 24 fame is such a well respected actor and director. In fact, he almost doesn't talk at all, more than anything he just repeats whatever a character said to him, but as a question right back. Someone this expensive to hire shouldn't be so weak in delivering lines, can we have David Hayter's rough voice back?\n- Story doesn't feel as impactful as previous games, while yes, the game is about revenge, it doesn't really feel like it. Often you do main missions that don't really have much place in the game's narrative, making it feel like a filler for the later main missions that have story to them. This repeats quite a few times, like some horrible anime that caught up to the original manga source over and over. Lots of awesome and weird stuff happened at every corner in Snake Eater and Guns of the Patriots, not so much here, but when it happens, oh boy, it happens.\n- Base and weapon development is very important, something this game emphasizes a lot on as it is very important to have tools to adapt to the enemy stronghold. Unfortunately, GMP and resources, which is the currency, is ultimately very hard to gain reliably, unless you repeatedly do the best paying mission over and over again or attack the same stronghold to essentially "farm" it. Although the latter has a respawn time, making certain resources, mainly fuel, hard to obtain.\n- Metal Gear Online has always been great, its always such a blast to play! So why is this part in the CONs section? Well, thats because Metal Gear Online has been delayed to January of 2016. But its not because I'm an impatient prick, its more of the fact that Kojima Productions had a falling out with Konami at the start of this year, leading to the eventual closure of Kojima Productions on June 2015. While Metal Gear Online will still be coming out, any updates will now be handled by Konami and a different team of developers, someone that won't guarantee the same quality as Kojima Productions in previous Online iterations.\n- Online base invasion is awesome, you get a chance to play as an invader, ala Dark Souls style, to basically steal enemy resources and personannel and add them to your own. Its a real fun experience to play and leads an amazing rush depending on what kind of approach you'll take to an enemy player's base. So why is this also in the CONs section? Thats because online base invasion is handled in the worst way possible due to the fact that enemy players can invade your base while you aren't  even online and steal your stuff without any possible player resistance (the AI security team can only do so much unless you equip them to the brim). There is no way to close this door as soon as you open it at a certain point in the game, so if you have any staff you don't want to lose, please, make sure to put them as direct contracts so jerks won't kidnap them.\n- Microtransactions are the worst, especially if its in a game that you already paid at full price.\n- All of this can be avoided if you simply opt to play the game offline, however, if you ever connect online, all gains or losses will automatically be updated to your save.\n- Lack of manual save files and replay theater. Wanna see a cutscene again? Restart the game from scratch or go to Youtube.\n\nAt the end of the day, the game delivers a fantastic single player experience delivered by Kojima Production that is muddled by poorly done online play injected by Konami. As a big Metal Gear fan for its 28 year lifespan, this is one of the best ways (though can be done better on more friendlier conditions) to see it out.","September 7, 2015","true","153.2"," 25 of 30 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","25","30","0","0"

I had high hopes for MGSV, i have waited so long and thought this will be the culmination, this will be the best MGS game. But it turned out to be the opposite.\n\nThe gameplay is really good and fun. You can approach the mission as you like. Going pure stealth no kills or killing everyone or just rambo style. It works all ways. The gameplay is basically the same as in paid demo - Ground zeroes. It's really an amazing feeling when you accomplish the mission not alerting anyone. Or you going onto rampage killing everyone. You can choose t what day time to do the missions. Day or night. At day enemies see you from a longer distance, at night they can't see you from 20 meters. But it changes if you always play at night. Enemies then start using night vision goggles.\n\nThe buddy system is really nice. You have a D-Horse which helps you travel longer distances fast. And you can give a command to poop. Nice huh? Then you have a D-Dog. He can spot enemies form quite a long distance, so he‘s pretty useful. He can equip a knife and kill enemies. And of course you have Quiet. A sexy half naked girl with the ability to turn invisible. She‘s a sniper and she can take out all the camp alone. You then run through the camp collecting resources and fultoning people to your base to build up your army. And the last one is D-Walker. It‘s really useful if you want destroy everything and kill everyone. You can have some fun using it.\n\nGraphics are average. The game has pretty good lighting so sometimes it looks really good, but when you play for some time you notice that graphics are not very good. At least the game runs on 60fps almost all the time.\n\nMGS always had amazing story and characters. In  MGSV  story is almost non existent and the characters are bland and uninteresting. The game is about completing missions in the same locations over and over again. The opening scene was awesome, it was so MGS, but after that the game gone downhill and the longer you play the worse it gets. Konami just wanted to make this game lengthy and took the easy and stupid path. There are 157 side ops which are boring and repetitive. The main game consists of 50 missions. Half of them are interesting and other half is just a content filler. Like it‘s not enough you‘re forced to replay some missions on harder difficulty in chapter 2. Why? Because the game must be longer. The story is unfinished. Some users found out hidden chapter in game files. So we can expect a DLC. The open world is empty and useless. The lack of cut scenes makes the game even worse. After the prologue don‘t expect much cut scenes.\n\nAnother annoying thing is FOB. You are forced to play online in a single player game. People can invade other peoples FOBs and steal resources and staff. So if you grind for hours for resourses and staff, someone can just steal it from you. There‘re microtransactions. You can buy an insurance so that other people couldn‘t invade you and steal your resources. The insurance is not permanent of course if you want to be safe you must pay more. Also you can buy more FOBs for real money. This is ridiculous and sad at the same time. Great job Konami, you just took the crown from Ubisoft. I hope Konami will disappear from gaming world forever. No one will miss them. At least you can disconnect from online and play the game how it‘s supposed to be played.\n\nIs it worth buying? At the current price no. Another no because it‘s Konami. They ruined the game. And just look at the newest PES. People shouldn‘t support them. Buy it when it‘s on sale for 10€ or so. You still can have some fun with the game. As a non MGS game it would be a really decent game, but there‘s not much left from MGS and as an MGS game it‘s the worst in the series.\n\nPros:\n\nFun and diverse gameplay\nQuiet\n\nCons:\n\nLack of cut scenes\nPoor story\nBland characters\nRepetitive missions\nContent filler missions\nThe most ridiculous microtransactions\nFOB\nKonami\n","October 7, 2015","false","85.9"," 262 of 442 people (59%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","59","262","442","27","21"

And I know i get it maybe your the type of person who prides themselves on being "That guy" if you're not the one telling ppl and your only hearing the praises you shut it down without a chance. Well throw that concept out of your head right now. To Ignore this game is like fighting your shadow you just look stupid. This is "that one game" you know what im talking about. That one game you call off workfor, you skip school for, you ignore your girlfriend for. This game is the game you introduce your kids to gaming with.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Owlakki/recommended/287700/","Owlakki","Owlakki™ 5 days til birthday","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Owlakki/","441 products in account","Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain is the final game in the Metal Gear Solid franchise produced by series creator Hideo Kojima. It is a continuation of the story of Ground Zeroes and a chronological sequel to the Metal Gear Solid 3, Portable Ops and Peace Walker. In a lot of ways Metal Gear Solid 5 is closer to what Kojima desired the original Metal Gear on the MSX to be. A game with a focus on modern military combat set in a style of 80's cheese.\n\nThere's a lot to say about the Phantom Pain. What it does well, and why fans walked out on the game feeling bitter and disappointed. In many ways the title reflects the mental state of the protagonist and the fanbase alike. There is a feeling of longing, for something that was there and is no longer.\n\nWe find ourselves in the shoes of Snake set 10 years prior to the events of Metal Gear. After a 9 year coma he awakes, and sets out for revenge and to rebuild his army. The storytelling in TPP is easily some of the worst in the series. The villains are unmemorable, the story is half baked, there are no interesting codec calls to shed exposition and provide a nice pacing break to the story. It feels very unlike a traditional Metal Gear Solid game in this regard. Snake feels like a silent protagonist, and you can swap him out with a member of your military just fine and feel very little difference. Revolver Ocelot is completely underused and miscast. The only character who feels like he's giving an actual performance is Robin Atkin Downes as Kazuhira Miller. Without David Hayter as Snake, TPP feels more like a modern military shooter and lacks the humor and self awareness the series was well known for.\n\nBut all that aside, the gameplay in TPP is easily the best in the series. The game feels much more akin to what a lot of other stealth action games have attempted but never quite grasped. Snake's movement is very tight and responsive, gunplay is good and quick, enemy AI responds to the player's actions convincingly, and stealth is always the most viable option. Ontop of this the game has sim-like elements related to kidnapping enemy soldiers and conscripting them to join your ranks. These sim elements brilliantly lead to you using stealth not just because the game is designed around it, but because you want to get better upgrades much quicker. It's an extremely comfy game and it feels very at home with other open world games like Red Dead Redemption and Far Cry 3. It also runs surprisingly well on PC.\n\nThe Phantom Pain might appeal to newcomers to the Metal Gear franchise much more for these reasons. And as a result it's very hard for me to recommend the game to longtime fans unless you're aware of what you're going into. It doesn't feel like Metal Gear went out with a bang but with a whimper.\n\nAnd in a lot of ways it is poetic justice. For long periods of time Metal Gear Solid was criticized for having fairly awkward gameplay, long cutscenes and unnecessary philosophical drama. What TPP does instead is give people what a more general audience wanted, but it sacrifices something for it. And long after the game is over, it leaves you with a feeling of pain in your fingertips where your arm once was.","February 9","true","59.5"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","20","23","0","0"

Granted that gameplay is  top notch, but the game doesn't exactly deliver with the gameplay when half the missions are "Go extract this prisoner" or "Go take out APC squad". The game is just lacking soul that previous MGS games had.\n\nThe story falls flat on it's head about mid-game, and then it doesn't exactly know what to do with it's self. A game that is widely known for being a movie is lacking in cutscenes and narrative. Most information is delieved by cassette tapes that can easily be missed. The characters are bland and are the generic black and white. What's even worse that the game leaves you with a "Phantom pain" figuratively\n\nWhile the gameplay is fun, the open world over works itself and results in a dead enviroment.  No active conflicts, no patrols out in the open field, and there's not even a random Helicopter flying around. To add insult to injury, the two maps are barely even different to each other. Somehow, Zimbabwe somehow looks exactly like Afganistan.\n\nThe game's alright, but the story is lacking and can get extremely repetitive.

Very rare to have a game this good. One of the rarest games out there you can marathon till you get sick of it and a few hours later marathon it again and get sick of it...again!\n\nPros:\nMUSIC: Brilliant; found a Soviet soldier playing "kids in america" I lol'd so bad given how serious the mission was.\nAMBIENCE: The tense music really makes your heart beat. Get ready to break a sweat when things get tense!\nSETTINGS: Bit dry at times and kinda boring (it is a desert after all) but otherwise ok, what GTAV's desert shoulda been.\nMISSIONS: Really immersive. Want an S Rank? Be prepared to play for hours on end.\nCHARACTERS: Mysterious even after 25 hours in. Can't wait to see characters develop after each mission.\nSTORY: Only 7% complete right now but 25+ hours in? I cannot believe this!\nHUNTING: You can hunt animals (not eat em unfortunately; only rescue them; you get paid though!). My favourite aspect of Red Dead Redemption was hunting animals; this is about 75% as good.\nWEAPONS: Good. NVG's awesome.\n\nCons:\nSAVING: Really wish it could have save anytime. Checkpoints are annoying at times (but don't turn them off there is no way to save manually; if there is one I've yet to find it).\nLEVELING UP: Takes a while to get good weapons and then get even better ones. Be prepared to kidnap every soldier and send em to Mother Base (solved later through scope upgrade which allows you to see highly skilled targetable soldiers to kidnap).\nCUTSCENES: Almost none; I miss them :( what happened Kojima?\nGAMEPLAY: Can feel like just cause 2 at times but obviously this is solved when you get into stealth and start sniping/tranqing everyone.\nHEALTHBAR: No eating to regenerate health and no health bar! This would have been so good given how Boss is spending most of his time in the desert.\n\nToo much to write about. Play the game.\n\nUPDATE: Just want to correct something on CUTSCENES. There are cutscenes in the game for important events. Its not like the game is totally devoid of them. Case in point being (NO spoiler here) the Quiet vs. Boss sniper battle (which I didn't expect to happen so randomly and caught me completely offguard; but man was it fun! Just don't forget to bring your sniper rifle, it was lucky i even had one at the time; my battle was in the daylight so she was extremely hard to spot; she's a one-two shot kill so beware when battling her; took me 40 mins to bring her down as she's constantly moving about and it's impossible to keep a tag on her). As for the STORY I just met Otacon's dad in a rescue mission that took 5 hours - reason being i wanted to kidnap every guard on base including the walking gears; which are also very hard to tranq with a silencer; their detection radius is insane). Also PLEASE do NOT spoil the game for yourself by watching youtube videos on it. It really takes it way from this rare experience. Also don't get on the hype bandwagon. The game has it's flaws; but that doesn't ruin the gameplay experience itself.","September 4, 2015","true","122.2"," 25 of 34 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","25","34","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tf2gentleman/recommended/287700/","tf2gentleman","pH. Tim","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tf2gentleman/","121 products in account","This review does not contain spoilers and any information revealed can be found in trailers prior to the game's release. Metal Gear has been under a lot of hype and I will explain the reasons why this game isn't at all what it's made up to be.\n\nUnlike the older Metal Gear games which can be completed in a few hours and generally feel satisfying, The Phantom Pain has an incredible amount of pointless filler. Of the 207 missions in the game, only 15 advance the story - that's just over 7% of the game for the story. What's even more frustrating is that towards the end of the game, the older missions are simply repeated with a slightly harder requirement such as no equipment or forced stealth. In fact, in the second chapter of the game, only one mission progresses the story and the player must play those repeat missions to progress. This is artificial lengthening of the game of the laziest order.\n\nThere is no character development in the whole game bar one character. Of all the characters in the game, only one has an arc involving development. Everyone else is the same at the end of the game as they are in the beginning. One character that had potential to be interesting was the Man on Fire. I originally thought he was some manifestation for war and conflict, following those that kill or live in war. As a metaphor he is very fitting - he cannot be destroyed and any damage people try to inflict is immediately repelled. It would have made an interesting game mechanic for players that go around killing instead of being non-lethal, much like the encounter with The Sorrow in Metal Gear Solid 3. However when his real identity and purpose is revealed, it's so poorly written that I was almost tempted to bang my head on my desk despite how cliché that phrase is.\n\nWhen the Metal Gear mech is revealed, the design is almost identical to a Metal Gear from another game, which is rather disappointing and seems like the artists couldn't be bothered to come up with something fresh and unique.\n\nThe AI is very bland and predictable. Seeing as 99% of engagements with the enemy are on flat open outdoor terrain, it simply comes down to learning the distances at which enemies will see you. The game devolves into shooting the enemies in the legs with tranquilisers, because as the game progresses the enemies wear helmets and body armour which resist darts. This leads nicely on to the next point.\n\nThe Phantom Pain takes place in Afghanistan and Africa. The gaming media made wild bravado of how open world the game is and how there's so much to do. This is complete nonsense. Afghanistan consists purely of roads with unclimbable cliffs on either side and a checkpoint every few hundred metres. Africa is the same except the cliffs have sometimes been replaced with grassland. There is nothing to do and the vast expanses are completely empty except for visual purposes. It is purely empty ground to traverse with no secrets or reasons to explore.\n\nAs for the story, it's truly horrendous and you'll find better written plots in a middle school creative writing class. The characters are one-dimensional, wooden and pretty much every single character in the game is motivated by revenge. I know the plots in the other Metal Gear games are rather silly, but this one enters a whole new frontier. As the game progresses, the plot becomes laughably bad and simply reveals that Kojima can't write stories or characters full stop. The supposed explanation for Quiet's lack of clothing is beyond stupid, serving as a blatant and flawed excuse for her body. I would respect it more if they just said "Here's a naked girl" rather than trying to come up with a plot reason why she has to be naked.\n\nGameplay-wise, you spend all of your time picking flowers, kidnapping men if their stats are high enough and completing pointless objectives like rescuing a man in a desert ten times, destroying a tank fifteen times, or rescuing Kojima. Speaking of which, his ego has reached a new record in this game. His name is displayed about three or four times in every single mission. The staff credits in the game are displayed twice, with his name about ten to fifteen times in that and he puts himself along with his sunglasses product line in the game. A mild fourth wall breaking reference, like a faceless soldier called Hideo would be fine, but splashing his name on the screen every ten seconds really takes the ♥♥♥♥.\n\nAlso, the game spoils the missions for you with ludicrous pre-mission credits that say "Starring..." which includes potential new characters and antagonists. You will know when a boss is coming because the game simply tells you in the pre-mission credits.\n\nLet's also not forget the Dark Souls inspired invasion system in which people can invade your base, steal your soldiers and resources while you're not even playing the game. I personally like to separate singleplayer and multiplayer from each other when I play games, thus being forced is aggravating at best. The Dark Souls mode is compulsory if you play the game connected, it physically restricts you from doing anything else when it wants you to enter the Dark Souls invasion rubbish by disabling all controls and menu options other than the one option to proceed. Always play the game in offline mode. Once you enter the invasion system, your resources will always be at risk. This should be completely optional and it isn't, so another black mark against the game.\n\nThere is no tension in the game and any potential moral conflicts are so forced that it becomes trite rather than thought-provoking. There's a point when child soldiers are introduced (this is shown in the various trailers) and it would have been far more effective to have Big Boss shoot children or show children being killed, illustrating that yes, war is hell. Unfortunately as soon as children show up, the game says that injuring children results in a game over screen, completing voiding player choice and not respecting the player to view situations that occur in real life.\n\nThis game is as boring and bland as Far Cry 2, with an abyssmal story, gameplay that devolves into picking flowers, minerals and kidnapping men along with extremely repetitive missions.\n\nMaybe buy it if it's on offer, but don't expect much. Luckily I bought this game at 40% off the Steam pre-order price, if I paid the full price I would feel ripped off.","September 10, 2015","false","97.6"," 623 of 1,106 people (56%) found this review helpful 48 people found this review funny","56","623","1","48","81"

Theres so many ways to infiltrate a base. Lots of different equipment at your disposal. Even if the best way to get an S rank is proning through the mission and using a tranq gun.  But in the end its all bout "kill this literal nobody" or "rescue this literal nobody". But the gameplay is just superb. Some of the best fun ive ever had.\n\nEverything else - 5/10. There was literally no reason to make this game open world. Theres nothing to do other than drive around running over animals. Every enemy camp is set up the same way, and all the sideops make you revisit the same place you just cleared out, which makes no sense. Same with main missions, its rescue and kill people you have no idea about or care about. Main missions and side missions happen in the same place.\nMotherbase is a HUGE place, with NOTHING to do. Really. Nothing. You just end up running around knocking out your soldiers. Its like a facebook game, collect soldiers, send them out with your phone on missions and they come back with supplies, thats it. Thats all Motherbase is for. Housing facebook game soldiers. Big boss rarely talks, I thinks he says 4 lines in total. The environment is all the same. Desert, rocks, then jungle/forest.\n\nNow comes the big one. Half of the game was cut from the finished product. Yes you heard me. Since Kojima was firedor whatever happened, they made the second half of the game REPEAT missions of 20 or so missions of the game that you already did, but a higher difficulty. I dont want to spoil anything, even though its not even worth to not spoil, but the game will end abruptly and youll be going around doing side ops waiting for a new main mission to pop up and then notice, its over.\n\nOverall 7/10. The gameplay saves this game BIG TIME for me. It would be one of the worst games of this year if it didnt. Stop giving in to the hype and the " A HIDEO KOJIMA GAME LOL XD" meme.\nWouldnt recommend for $60.\n\nAnother couple of things I want to point out because I recently finished the game. I really feel like ive been robbed of 100 hours of my life. I wanted to like this game. The first hour of this game feels like it was writted by a 3rd grader. Idk let me stop i can write another 100 paragrapgs, but im done, i can finally uninstall and move on with my life.\nAnd now, KOJIMA DRONES TO THE RESCUE.","September 13, 2015","false","94.7"," 109 of 186 people (59%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","59","109","186","8","38"

The game has lots of repetitive missions but you will never get bored of playing this game just because of its amazing gameplay and weapons and because of the different ways of doing a single objective you can do a mission 2-5 times like me just to see how many ways something can be achieved.\nits definitely worth buying and playing, even if you are a non mgs fan and even if you hated previous mgs for bad controls, too long cutscenes etc you will love this game :) and if you are a mgs fan like me then i am sure you have already bought it, played it, wrote your own fan fiction about the ending of mgs saga story and linked the dots which Kojima and Konami didn't lol :P\n\n\nAnyway i hope this review helps anyone who wants to buy this game :) it is my first review so if i did something wrong be sure to tell me :)\n\n","January 6","true","195.2"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","2"

The story so far has been intreguing and you start to see two colliding ideals within the motherbase, through your actions you can decide which side you take for some missions.\n\nGameplay::\nThe controls are as smooth as butter on a heated butter knife, very responsive! I was playing with a PS4 controller and it just felt "right". The mechanics have changed for the better from Ground Zeroes, Some animation times have improved or been sped up in order to keep the games flow steady and everything flows much better.\nThe only issues I had were with D-Horse and Running, The horse is very unresponsive at times, often times just stopping completely or getting stuck on rocks, also stopping the horse running is extremely hard and often times sent me flying off a cliff to my death. I now avoid the Horse.\nCreating motherbase takes time and resources, though it never seems daunting or boring. There are many weapons and items to create and you will have fun trying to get soldiers with high enough stats to create them.\nThe Buddy system is fun to use, personally I like DD at the moment, he is fast and spots enemies (and prisoners) in your area which is a life saver sometimes.\n(I haven't unlocked FOB mode so I cannot review ONLINE play)\n\nAudio:\nThe audio is brilliant in this game, The voice acting has never been better for most the characters, Snake feels distant in some of his audio which is a shame considering the actor change, but overall Keifer does a decent job. Some audio tapes found in the field have a unrealistic sound radius sometimes where you can only hear it when very close to it, regardless of it being extremely loud on inspection.\n\nVisuals and performance::\nNever have I seen a game so heavily optimised! This is the most optimised game I have ever played which explains the small download size! Don't be fooled, it is not because the game is small, its because the game is constructed beautifully which is why even on lower spec machines it still works and runs beautifully.\nThe cutscenes are all realtime but most the time it is near impossible to notice due to the games graphics being so crisp, with only a few issues such as the dynamic blood system creating some seams on clothing or on Snakes face, though it is rare and isnt extremely noticable. Flora is beautiful and the world, as vast as it is, looks amazing with minor issues every now and then such as textures not loading in the far far distance which is only noticable if zoomed in on purpose (I am a game design student so I look for these things).\n\n\nOverall::\nThe game is worth a buy, even more so if you have played the metal gear solid games before this one, you will get hours and hours out of this game before even getting into the actual story. It looks brilliant, is optimised to the max and will give you a good run for your money.\n\nI was running on a i7 4770k, GTX 780Ti gaming edition, 16 GB RAM and am holding a solid 60 FPS the whole time on the max settings.","September 3, 2015","true","216.2"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

You'll most likely have hours of fun playing the game. But why on earth would I give this game a negative review?\n\nThe simple reason comes down to the story. My first major issue is that the story just abrutly ends. Imagine if in Metal Gear Solid, the credits rolled after the torture scene with ocelot. That's what it is like here. The game sets up a bunch of different plot points and then leaves them unresolved when the game ends. Konami even had the final battle and ending cut from the game to push the game out, you can even find the alpha footage on youtube.\n\nMy second issue comes from Kojima. Don't get me wrong, Kojima is the man. But in Phantom Pain he has forgotten many crucial plot details from MG1, 2 and MGS4. The end result is that he has retconned a great deal of the plot and actually has ruined some of Solid Snake's backstory aswell.\n\nAnd one last thing. There's too much god damn exposition throughout the story. Many key moments in the Phantom Pain are just explained through long winded dialogue instead of being shown. Of course the series has always been guilty of this to some extent, but in this game it's almost the entire plot that is conveyed in this way. Code Talker is the worst when it comes to this problem.\n\nThey also ruined all the mystery and wonder of The End by explaining his abilities with... Well you'll find out. But it's kind of like Star Wars: The Phantom Menace which ruined the sense of wonder of The Force with Midi-chlorians. It's very ironic that they share a similar name.\n\nI enjoyed the game but not the story. It's probably done more damage to the franchise than Konami's pachinko machines ever could. While the story has its share of twists and suprises, it ultimately doesn't live up to the rest of the series. It's like a jigsaw piece that doesn't fit, so you have to force it to fit by hammering at it until it does. You ultimately end up with a broken picture.\n\nIf you don't care about the story, you'll probably enjoy the gameplay. But if you're a real fan of the Metal gear franchise you'll understand exactly why I take issue with the game. My best guess to the source of the problem is Konami making cutbacks to their video game sector and Kojima simply being forgetful when it comes to his plotlines. Amazing game, terrible story.","September 10, 2015","false","114.6"," 149 of 261 people (57%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","57","149","261","8","40"

You now need to develop a new security team to defend your FOB from invasions. This is where my Clash of Clans comment draws in. PLAYERS are the only force to invade your FOBs and if they succeed they get to take some of your men.\n\nThis affects your SINGLE PLAYER game. These losses can affect ALL of your teams, you WILL lose levels on your teams, you CANNOT disable FOBs. you get to choose where to place your men, your guns, and your drones, but that doesn't affect anything when a player can LITERALLY kill everyone and take 40 men.\n\nPersonally, I like the game.

You get the usual interesting characters that Kojima is known for and of course an overly long tutorial/intro that could have been shorter, but in general the story, characters and dialogue are not as good as in past games.\n\nThe way the story and cutscenes are done is different from previous Metal Gear Solid games, less cutscenes and more storytelling that is IN GAME( Such as cassette tapes,etc..). Definatly a different approach to that aspect when compared to past games, but I am liking it so far mainly for the gameplay.\n\nGorgeous graphics, the game runs very well and it is alot of fun to play. No idea how the online will be come Jan, but I wasn't to huge on MGS4's online. The singleplayer campaign is worth it alone imo, like The Witcher 3, side missions are a good deal mroe fun than alot of other open world games.\n\nI have had no crashes, no performance issues and no gamebreaking bugs so far after 7 hours, it is very well optimized, especially for how good the game looks. If you ran the Prequel fine, you will have no issue playing MGS5.\n\nSome of these microtransactions for the online I have been reading about sounds like it was not needed which makes me think maybe this was one issue Kojima had with Konami while this game was being made.\n\nThe audio is very well done also, as is the voice work, this game really is a joy to play in nearly every aspect. Kojima has always reminded me somewhat of one of my favorite foreign movie directors, Takashi Miiike. Both are almost always brilliant, different and unique in alot of ways. Sure they both can take it a little far sometimes with there own style and flare but the good far outweigh the bad most the time and MGS5 is no different. Sure there is the odd time when I feel like Kojima and Takashi Miike both could use a better editor or tone some things down but would we honestly want that in the end? For me personally I don't think either would be nearly the fantastic creators they are if they just kept everything to the script and did things like everyone else. Imagine them playing it by the book?\n\nStacked to the brim with things to do, addicting gameplay and the usual Kojima flare and brilliance that we have come to love, an overly long intro/tutorial and some microtransactions can't bring down what is one of the best Metal Gear Solid games yet and just behind Witcher 3 and Pillars of Eternity as my favorite games of 2015 so far.\n\nWhere does this game stack up in the MGS series? For me it is hands down better than MGS4 (which was the weakest of the bunch for me personally) and up there with MGS 1-3 qualitywise. The controls and gameplay are quite improved from the early games which is nice. Weither you are brand new to the series or a long time vet like myself, I think you will enjoy this game. All stealth fans, MGS fans and open world fans need to check out this game ASAP!\n\nThe last issue I have is with the motherbase, this could have been done so much better. It is a very cool idea but with a bit more depth man... this could have been a HUGE positive for the game but as it is, it just feels very empty and after awhile somewhat useless. Far from perfect but still very enjoyable for its gameplay!","September 1, 2015","true","57.0"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

So much has been cut out and the worst part is that the cut content felt like it SHOULD have been there.\n\nThat's the real phantom pain.\n\nLet's talk more about the game overall though.\nPros\n-Gameplay is solid. There's versatility to the ways you can complete a mission usually (A lot of the missions are repetitive though and they're only done because Kaz told you so. Not for story reasons). I'm still enjoying just trying to do things with new tactics and weapons.\n\n-The Motherbase macromanagement is pretty cool because you can swap members over to other specialties to increase the level and get that cool upgrade. However, that brings me to the negatives now.\n\nCons\n-The biggest one that I feel is a negative is also one that's becoming alarmingly apparant. Konami is trying to convert MGS:V into some kind of microtransaction game (Most likely to try and make up for the huge budget for this game). With each update, they add better weapons and other features such as better security devices to protect your FOB.\n\nBut the cost requirements.\n\nThe costs to get these new items. Holy ♥♥♥♥. They want you to either spend all of eternity looking for elite members to replace your team or buy another FOB with those MB coins to add more space to your base and save yourself time.\n\n-Upgrading your base costs a ♥♥♥♥ ton of resources and time. No idea why.\n\n-Story is ♥♥♥♥. Not gonna let this one go. I have never been so disappointed and upset. The ending is just thrown at you with no build up. There are so many plot lines that are never fully explained either. The ending was something out of an M. Night Shamalyanading-dong movie.\n\nAnd I'm talking about his recent movies.\n\nSnake doesn't talk at all wtf. I felt like I was controlling an emotionless rock for the entire story. Literally all the conversations that he DOES talk in are in cassette tapes that are completely boring and are usually just Kaz or Ocelot talking. His name should've been "Silent Snake". It would sound cooler and makes a ♥♥♥♥ ton more sense than "Punished 'Venom' Snake".\n\nMost of the characters are boring as ♥♥♥♥ too. Ocelot and Kaz's only purpose is to tell you why this mission is important or what "____" does and are just there to hold your hand and explain the plot as it trudges along.\n\n-Open world....?\nThere is nothing out there except sheeps and bears to tranq and fulton out. There's no one or thing out there of interest, no motivation to explore around the barren wasteland. It's a serious flaw and makes the game feel so empty at times.\nMotherbase itself I expected to be filled with activities and soldiers training like in the trailers.\nlolnope.\nThere is just random people walking around that salute you to increase their "morale". But here's another kicker.\nBase morale doesn't do ♥♥♥♥. I completed all of Chapter 2 without having gone back and it was totally fine with no negative consequences.\n\n-FOB is required. This goes a bit into my first con point. I remember they said something along the lines, "FOB's are optional and are not required to complete the game." in one of the gameplay demo's.\nWe were suckered from the start.\nYour first FOB is mandatory to build at some point in the game. And as for that second part, yea it's not needed to complete the game's pathetic story missions. But if you want to upgrade your weapons to something better than a toaster, you DO need that extra space that the FOB gives. ESPECIALLY with the November update.\n\n-CUT CONTENT. I wouldn't mind that there was cut content if they didn't tease you with the knowledge that THERE WAS CONTENT THAT WAS CUT.\nThis game got so overhyped and I believed it all. I feel it would've been better to have faith in the next Call of Duty being different than to have believed in all the ♥♥♥♥ they talked about in their gameplay demo's.\n"Motherbase is customizable and will be unique to every player!"\n\nYou can literally change the color  of MB to one of seven-ish pre-existing colors.\n\n♥♥♥♥ me.\n\n\nThere are so many more smaller points that I want to make about this game but I'm not sure if it's necessary to make my message clear:\n\nThis game is really just unfinished and with the way Konami is handling it, it's obvious that they are going to try and squeeze as much money as they can out of their last triple A game. It's a damn shame too because the actual gameplay is solid and refined.\n\nAt first, I was outraged that Konami would take off Hideo Kojima's name off of the cover of his last MGS game.\n\nBut now.\nI believe that Kojima knew what Konami had in plan and took it off himself.\nFor he saw the monster that was created.\nTo spare himself the shame of what it had become.\n\nTL;DR: Buy it when it's cheaper.\nRight now... It just hurts too much to spend 60 bucks on a game that sold off its prologue and cut out its ending.\n\n*EDIT* To clear up a bit of stuff. Also it's been a hella long time since I posted the initial review.\n\nA large amount of that time I played was spent just farming for resources and S rank people. Literally just doing runs to pick up resource containers (hopefully snag a few good people along the way) and then going prone in a truck and afking while it went back and forth between checkpoints while I slept/went to go do other stuff. And then this got patched and it took even longer to do something similar to it.\n\nThe way resources work in this game is that you have to first obtain unrefined resources and then over a period of time, your base will convert them into usuable resources for upgrading. But you have to be going between checkpoints in order for the game to reset the timer for converting resources.\n\nBasically, they're even gating how much you can use the resources that you gathered and it takes a LOT to get some of the later base upgrades as I stated before.\n\nI understand that my hours and my review do not look supportive of each other from an outside view, but farming was unfortunately a large part of it. That's what made the game so obnoxious for me because it was taking an ungodly amount of time. What was worse than the resources were the level requirements for some of the weapons. They were becoming so high that even with a fully staffed S rank base, you may not hit the required level. This meant you gotta start hunting down S+ members which are even rarer or spend money to make a base if you don't have enough MB Coins (they gave some during events but otherwise it takes around 5ish months with daily log ins to have enough for one base...? I saw they had a half off on your second base deal going on recently so that was pretty cool and nice of them.)\n\nEven with all those hours, I still haven't fully upgraded my stuff. When Konami stated that they wouldn't need players to spend money on the game, they didn't explain that they were basically going to handle future updates like a mobile game where the new stuff is gated by a humongous time wall.\n\nBut now that the price has been lowered quite a lot as well as Metal Gear Online finally being released for the PC, it's probably worth a pick up if you have the cash for it. The same problems still plague the game though and that's what makes me so sad about the game. It really is amazing gameplay wise but the way they're handling it is not on the same level.","November 17, 2015","false","360.4"," 28 of 42 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","28","42","4","2"

From the perspective of MGS 1 and 2 this game is missing the old gameplay and ambience. I really have to look hard to see a MGS game in this.\n\nAs for the gameplay it feels almost like a mix bewteen Tomb Raider and Sniper Elite, but then with modern gadgets and tools. As in Tomb Raider you have to gather plants and wildlife (and diamonds) just as in this game. Which is a bit weird as you have a large base with personel. Apparently you have the supplies to build a gigantic offshore plaform, but you do still have to gather plants for supplies. And the sneaking/killing/tagging/overwatching is fairly the same as in Sniper Elite, but then in a modern day setting.\n\nSo far (30 hours of gameplay) the game conststs of doing uninspired missions such as 'free a prisoner' or 'steal a blueprint' or 'kill an officer'. Luckily those missions take place on a good designed open world(ish) map where you have decent amount of freedom to complete the missions. The fun part of the gameplay is that you can choose your own way of finishing the objective and clearing out hostile area's while using all the neat gadgets and weapons you have available. With the things you 'earn' from those missions you can expand, upgrade and develop your base further.\n\nThe graphics are really nice in this game and all the assets/objects/characters on the map are all well modeled and textured (vegetation could have been better though). And on top of that the game runs very well on maxed settings. There could have been some more graphics options (specially AA options. jaggies on maxed settings), but it is all decent enough.\n\nFrom nostalgia perspective and remembering the old gameplay of the first 2 games in the series you might get a bit dissapointed, but if you forget that this a MGS game then this game is a good game with solid gameplay and game mechanics thats well worth the price tag on the store page.\n\nThere is also an online part in the game that lets you compete against other players, but I haven't touched that yet.\n\n85/100\n\nUpdate after 100 hours:\n\nThe gameplay overall is stilll pretty cool. However, the story missions gameplay gets interupted by totally lame missions where you are up gainst 'super villians'. It is just horribly designed and totally brakes the normal gameplay of the game. It's so bad that I just stopped doing the story missions and completed 100+ side-ops missions instead. I litterally had to exploit and brake missions to continue the story missions as in a 'normal' gameplay way it's frustrating and simply not fun to do the story missions that contains 'super villians'.\n\nFor this it gets a:\n\n75/100","May 30","true","111.0"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NQuarter/recommended/287700/","NQuarter","N Quarter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NQuarter/","444 products in account","Highly Recommended\n\nBest enjoyed with all Markers, Enemy Presence, and Damage Direction turned OFF\n\nI'll try and keep this short"ish". Sorry if I completely leave out many aspects to talk about.\n\nWell, The Phantom Pain... what can I say except this Game was Epic! As a long time Metal Gear fan, I was really pleased, and enjoyed every second of this Game. It has certainly been years for me to play a Game and have time fly by, and this offered just that.\n\nIt is the first stab at an Open World playstyle which has mixed feelings through the Community. Personally I thought it fit really well, and felt exactly like a Metal Gear Game. It comes with 2 reletively decent sized Maps, Northern Afghanastan which is full of Desert Terrain, and Central Africa [my favourite] which is lush Green Terrain with some Jungle area's.\n\nEverything Gameplay, and Graphics wise has been greatly improved, and due to the Fox Engine it runs on, it's extremely well optimized for lower end machines. The controls were very responsive and smooth and easy to pick up. Even after going back to play Ground Zeroes again, it's easy to see that they have been greatly imrpoved from that.\n\nIf Stealth isn't really your drug, then don't worry because the Game can be played with Combat with equal rate of success, which not only gave you variety to complete the 38 Story Missions and 157 Side Ops, but it was always good to have some fun with it, whether you want to go in and kill everyone on sight with a Machine Gun, or go high in the Mountains and have some Sniper fun, or just call in a Bombardment or Air Support and watch the explosions.\n\nIt also offers Material gathering to help improve your Weapons, and also a Fulton recovery System to extract any enemy, Vehicles and Heavy Weapons to help build your army up. If you ever get tired of using Snake through Missions, or Side Ops, then no worries, just add ANY of your staff in the Combat Unit and use them on Missions. This doesn't offer any special traits, but it's still good to do from time to time [and yes, Female Characters can also be used].\n\nThe change from David Hayter, to Kiefer Sutherland from the TV hit series 24 was also great to see. Ever since 24 came out, I always saw Kiefer as a good role as Snake, and he really did hit the nail on the head. Unfortunately, his Voice acting doesn't have a major role as I would have liked which was a shame, but from what he did, was very effective and gave Big Boss more "emotion" to his voice [nothing against David Hayter].\n\nPeople have claimed that The Phantom Pain offers less Cinematics then previous titles, when really it has 5 Hours of Cinematics, and 6 Hours of Cassette Tape recordings of Conversations and reletive Intel [equalling most Metal Gear Games]. However, with such a large scale Game, this is all dwarfed to be less significant. It really does depend on if you focus on the Story Missions, or if you focus on other aspects such as Side Ops, or the Management side from time to time.\n\nChapter 1 will have you completing 31 Story Missions, and 3 Mission Side Op. It is also the typical Story you'll see in all Metal Gear Games, and people have also stated that the villian was kind of underwhelming. Let's be honset though, I've found all villians in Metal Gear to be that. They don't always have to be someone with large Guns who offer an epic battle. It's about the depth of the plot and how it is delivered in the Game. I found it to be effective in a way it needed to be, which to me was satisfying.\n\nTo get a better feel of the Story while playing though, I'd definitely recommend listening to the Cassette Tapes as soon as you aquire them, and also play the Mission Briefing before selection, which gives a more indepth explanation than what you get once selected.\n\nThe only thing I didn't enjoy through Chapter 1, was some of the Missions were simple to do, and felt like Side Ops, such as Rescue a specific Target for one example. The majority of the Missions though were unique, and some offered some really nice settings. I really do recommend turning all of the hand holding devices OFF as mentioned at the top. It really does add a whole new level of enjoyment.\n\nChapter 2 however, was a huge let down. Although there are "19 Missions" left after completing Chapter 1, 12 of these Missions are just re-used Missions on Hardmode which have no connection to where the Story is currently at. They are just thrown in there to make it look more complete, leaving 7 Story Missions, and 8 Mission Side Ops.\n\nInfact, you don't even need to complete these re-used Missions to continue the Story. All you need to do is Side Ops until you get a Radio Call to either come back to Base, or that your Mission List has been updated [usually 2 - 3 Side Ops].\n\nThis was most likely due to the falling out with Konami and Kojima, with Konami not liking how much money was being spent on the Development, and just wanted it out the door ASAP. Which is a real shame, as Kojima really did wonders for this Game, and to have the end of it rushed so badly just shows how disgusting of a Company Konami can be.\n\nNot only was Chapter 2 rushed, but it is missing the Final Mission that wraps up the Story of Eli [who is a major Character in the Metal Gear Series]. However, if you purchase the Collectors Edition, you get to see the Concept Art, as well as the final Cinematic 30% completed.... [something that should have been given to everyone. Just Youtube it though, it's pretty Epic].\n\nAs it is though, it has left fans with a foul taste in their mouth, and really destroys what a Perfect Game The Phantom Pain "could" have been. Even with such a downside of all of this, it doesn't change the fact that The Phantom Pain is worth every cent at Full Price. Chapter 1 is fully complete. The Gameplay is rich and entertaining. The Cinematics are amazing with extremely well done Voice acting, and the replayability, or long term play is completely there.\n\nOne more thing I'd like to mention;\n\nI do have to quickly talk about Quiet though, who is a Sniper you come across reletively early on. Let's be honest, she is purely used as a sex object who just wears a Bra and G-String... However, that's not the problem. The problem being the shots from the Cinematics are intentional to focus on various parts of her body... To me, this just made ANY scene with her cringe worthy, and was a great way to ruin a perfectly acceptable Sniper character.\n\nGenre\n- Stealth / Action\n\nGame Elements\n- Open World\n- Day Night cycle\n- Weather elements\n- Replay Missions\n- Stealth\n- Combat\n- Air Support on Request\n- Base Management\n- Staff Management\n- Material Gathering\n- Weapon Tree\n- Full Weapon Customization\n- FOB Online Mode [Optional]\n- Metal Gear Online 3 [Seperate Game]\n- Cardboard Boxes\n- Balloons!\n\nAverage Playthrough\n- 50 Hours\n\nLiked\n- Excellent Voice Acting\n- Excellent Visuals\n- Excellent Cut Scenes [as always]\n- Smooth and Responsive controls\n- Easy UI [iDroid and during Gameplay]\n- Great range of classic Music to find\n- Variety to complete Missions\n- Tons of Side Quests\n\nDisliked\n- Side Ops can feel repetative\n- Chapter 2 feels rushed\n- Final Mission not included\n- Quiet displayed as a sex object","January 27","true","79.3"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","1"

I don't hate it and feel that this is a great game on it's own, but it's not the same Metal Gear I love, I'm not being nostalgic, I think that this game is lacking in the level design, item uses, multiple issues in the game. The mechanics are superb and I do love the refinements that they have made over Ground Zeroes and it's not the new ''mature'' story that turned me off, in fact, I was really expecting and WELCOMING this grimdark game that would of shown us the downfall of Big Boss.\n\nGAME MAP; HALF FULL OR HALF EMPTY?\nThis game's world feels dead to me, the first minute I booted the game up, I was in love with it, the intro was something I didn't expect and I liked, the Phantom Limbs mission had me hyped since I was finally playing the mission I was shown atleast 2 years ago at E3 2013 and now I was finally playing it!\n\nThis mission and a select few others are the only interesting ones as they have something important that is required for the plot to progress.

Both of them, Afghan is more interesting to me but I felt like they completely missed the mark with it, there's only about 4-5 areas in each map that's fun to infiltrate, the rest are no fun, are open and have nothing interesting about them, literally copy pasted about the map.\n\nPORTRAYAL OF CONFLICT AMONGST SOLDIER FORCES\nIn MGS4 (♥♥♥♥ you I loved it), there were two sides to the conflict in the area, the Militia and the PMC, this idea was only shown in Act 1 and 2 but it was amazing, siding with the Militia would make it easier to go through areas after you wait for them to clear it out and then you're free to walk about them and it will not trigger an alert, siding with the PMC does nothing cause you're still their enemy.\n\nThe two sides of conflict made it either easier or harder to progress and I loved that idea, you could slip by enemies that are focused on the other side of their conflict, or you could side with the underdog, watch them win (even assist if you wish) and then not bother slipping by but rather walk about.\n\nIn MGSV, we constantly hear about the Mujahideen and whatnot, but where are they? I didn't see a single Mujahideen in the map fighting the enemy, I didn't even see conflict! I only saw a few Mujahideen PRISONERS. Total downgrade from MGS4 in this department, that and the fact we cannot use disguises or anything at all since camouflage isn't as easily changable as in the past but rather a choice you make at the start, or a choice you make later, pay for then wait for, meaning temporary disguises would be painful to use as you would have go through all that effort, etc.\n\nI noted in Africa, there were multiple Private Forces companies but noone ever fought one another, they weren't even in the radius of one another, it was only static soldiers that wouldn't react to the outside ecosystem but only react to you. As if there's nothing else important in their lives that only you are their worry.\n\nSTORY; KOJIMA WENT PANTS ON HEAD STUPID\nI'm sure at this stage, anyone that's played the game is familiar with the trailers, the trailers were beautiful, every single one of them had a song that would perfectly capture the tone and went well with the shots we were shown.\n\nThis will delve into spoilers, so anything I have blacked out, I am talking about spoilers, so please, if you haven't beaten the game (I mean Chapter 2) and look at the spoilers, don't moan to me, this is a warning.\n\nMetal Gear Solid V didn't have the grimdark story I expected, I expected a story about how Kaz and Big Boss became demons, how information can kill people from the qoute 'Words can Kill' but instead we get this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ing story about ♥♥♥♥ing PARASITES of all things killing people when they speak a specific language.\n\nSkullface was a very interesting villain, but underused, I didn't see him as often as Volgin but he did intrigue me a fair bit, he was pretty cool in Ground Zeroes, he had that proper villian aura, but instead we get this idiot that was technically Big Boss' phantom during MGS3 (this is why he qoutes Volgin with ''Remember the Alamo'' since he knew that is proof of him being there during the Virtuous Mission since anyone else that would have heard it is dead bar Sokolov at this point)\n\nBig Boss never becomes the villain, in this game he's the nice dude that saves kids, and mercy kills his men since they're infected. Then you think, how is Big Boss a demon, you even collect Heroism Points.  So I finally beat the game, the plot twist? We were the medic in GZ, Big Boss ran off making Outer Heaven in Zanzibar land and your character becomes the Big Boss that dies in MG1, meaning the only loop it closes is to explain why Big Boss is alive in MG2.\n\nWhat was the point of it all? We do hear about Sniper Wolf and other Sons of Big Boss members encountering Big Boss, why couldn't they put that into the game?\n\nI really liked Ground Zeroes, it was an amazing prologue. Camp Omega was beautifully designed and felt like a living, breathing Guantanamo Bay style area, and the whole situation with Chico and Paz felt like MGSV was gonna include more taboos but instead we get nothing too taboo at all.\n\nTL;DR Spoilers: The game makes no important additions into the Metal Gear Franchise.\n\n\nMUSIC; 80s HITS AND ORIGINALS MISSES\nThe track list in this game is quite good, with a few hits, but there's not too many tracks from that era and I'd prefer if they even tracks like ''Gimme Shelter'', ''All Along The Watchtower'' or even something as obscure as ''Holiday in Cambodia'', instead we get ''Friday I'm in Love'' (from 1992), but nothing that captures the 70s/80s war vibe.\n\nTracks from Ground Zeroes do not return. The game's OST sucks ♥♥♥♥ compared to past games since Ludvig Forssell isn't half as good as Harry Gregson-Williams (who got pushed to producer rather than composer) and the only memorable tracks in this are 'V has come to', 'Disarmament' and that one song that plays in the Quarantine Mission.\n\nI would type more about how FOBs suck, how MGO3 doesn't look half as good as MGO2, how annoyed I am at unique characters like Glaz and Palitz aren't playable (♥♥♥♥, a proper Big Boss character with no horn and no scars and both arms would have been a nice alt costume for Venom) and how disappointed I am in this game but I already had to cut a portion of this review out like Kojima did to the game.\n\nI'm still going to 100% this game then I can finally write it off as a waste of three years waiting, €1600 euros wasted and personally, a never ending feeling of disappointment knowing this game isn't the Missing Link.","October 12, 2015","false","110.5"," 122 of 214 people (57%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","57","122","214","7","23"

There's supposed to be a war in Afghanistan going on, yet we don't see any Mujahideen fighters, civilians, or even any enemies outside of the outposts. There are no cars or tanks on the road except the very rare SINGLE transport truck that drives around. Tanks, choppers, even most animals do NOT spawn unless you are in a mission. Free roam is heavily restricted to recruiting a handful of guys, grabbing the holy grail that is the transport truck if you want to be able to go anywhere not on foot, and taking in the sights. And with both maps looking like a brownish dessert for the most part, that will get old quick. There are a few green areas here and there. but for the most part it falls off. There is no 'predator-esq' jungles. Most disapointingly is the lack of stronghold, or anything concrete really, the buildings are small and easily cleared/forgotten.

While recovering in Cyprus, he's set upon by a mysterious assassin whose only motive is to fail spectacularly at killing a helpless man who can't lift his limbs. Sam is saved only by the timely intervention of Reznov, a black ops agent who has been watching over you for your nine year sleep and you can tell he's not real because imagine a ten year medical bill by someone faking it.\n\nAfter an hour-long intro that serves no real purpose but to teach Sam the ropes of tactical stealth once more (and show hundreds of people being slowly butchered against your screen because Kojima has a thing for trying to impress Americans), Psycho Mantis appears and is completely retconned into a magical nine year old that can shoot down helicopters with giant fiery whales but can't seem to catch a 40lb limp noodle of a man who hasn't used his muscles in ten years.

I've been a fan of Metal Gear Solid and Hideo Kojima for many years now having played MGS3 Snake Eater endlessly, so this game and its concepts were nothing new to me. If it were totally new, I would describe it as a strategic game mixed with action.\n\nIf you enjoy games that involve the use of powerful weapons that turn you into a Rambo killing everything as quickly as possible in a fantasy land, then you will probably not like this game. MGS Phantom Pain is a game that allows the player to act more realistically. Mission objectives focus on avoidance of detection, destruction of communications, the use of nonlethal force, and the extraction of enemies and hostages with the intent to gain information and new recruits.\n\nTo kill an enemy actually eliminates the possibility of an elite mission, which is considered to be more successful with tactical takedowns, interrogations, and extractions of useful and high ranking recruits who can then switch sides and help us at our base of operations. It's a much more cerebral game than most, and it also is an open world environment with many possibilities that are totally open to the choices of the person playing. Kojima's games really consider the use of intelligence over brute force and much of Sun Tzu's philosophy comes to mind while playing.\n\n“The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting”\n“The greatest victory is that which requires no battle”\n\nSuch an incredible amount of intelligence went into this game and its production, but humor and emotions can also shine through and be felt. It's a great game, but its also an amazing work of art by a master.","January 19","true","984.8"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

This is also coming from a huge fan of the franchise who's played every Metal Gear game many times to completionist values.\n\nI was so excited for this game, hyped beyond belief and following ever since the original Phantom Pain tease that was a fake project. This game lived up and went beyond all that hype, for the entire first half of the game.\n\nThe world building though empty is impressive. Afghanistan and Africa feel like military zones, where the small towns, bases and checkpoints have soliders patrolling, watching out for intruders (which, I admit is only yourself - so it feels a little off when you think about it).\n\nThe missions are fun, challenging, stealth is of course always what you should go for, but it's not neccesary - pick up an assault rifle or grenade launcher and blast through. But, you'll be missing out on a lot.\n\nMother Base building up, fultoning soldiers back to build up your own personal military force, and going to visit the place you've put hours into building up in the Seychelles.\n\nThe exitement all ended in the second half, the missions feel repetetive sometimes, or rather lackluster. The story falls apart, to the point where infamously there is a missing mission with a huge unanswered storyline left out - and potentially an entire third act that was cut.\n\nThere are issues with this game, the story is the weakest out of any Metal Gear game, there are no classic boss fights like FoxHound. Dead Cell or The Cobra Unit. There are no codec moments. There is no big ending.\n\nBut, it's one of the best open world games I've ever played. Capturing soldiers never gets old, and sneaking through a base crowded with soldiers who have donned riot suits or helmets because of your tactics on the battlefield feels tense and gives a challenge. The buddy system is pretty cool, I enjoyed all of them greatly. Research and Development of new items was always something I loved in Peace Walker and it's even better now. Creating new platforms on Mother Base (which you control unlike Peace Walker) is also brilliant, and getting a FOB to build a second one for greater resources and higher ranks of your different units. I hate the MB coin microtransaction system that I never used, the FOB's should have been gradually unlocked through the game, or cost huge amounts of GMP (in game resources).\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend this game. It has flaws, but it is still oh so fantastic.","March 5","true","158.7"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","2"

I grew up playing Metal Gear games, and this is easily my most anticipated game of all time. Thank you Hideo Kojima for all the great game that you made.\n\nSTORYNine years after the events of Ground Zeroes, Big Boss wakes up from his coma. After being helped escape from the hospital by Ocelot, he goes to Afghanistan to rescue Kaz Miller, rebuild Mother Base and take revenge on Cipher and Skull Face. Saying more would be a spoiler, and all I can say is that I found the story very interesting and full of plot twists (both believable and not).\nUnlike the other games, the cutscenes are shorter and more accessible then before, and the Codec calls have been replaced by cassette tapes that can be played while exploring the battlefield. This way, the gameplay is never broken and you can enjoy a better look at what happens. If you are new to the franchise, you won't understand jack, however the story isn't shoved down your throat like in Guns of the Patriots, and you can just as easily skip the cutscenes if you don't care.\n\nGRAPHICSThe Fox Engine really is sublime: even at the lowest settings every facial animation, every little detail in the open world is beautiful, and everything runs at sweet 60fps at high resolutions. Even though it is open world, the world is still full of details and secrets to discover, as well as varied locations: you will infiltrate power plants, villages, highly-guarded camps and bridges. The game is gorgeous and you don't even need a great PC to enjoy it.\n\nGAMEPLAYFirst of all, the combat. You have tons of possibilities to handle each situation: go in guns-a-blazing with rifles and rocket launches, snipe from afar, call air support, hold-up everyone at gunpoint... The choice is yours. And you are not punished for going on a killing spree, but even more so if you don't kill anyone and avoid detection.\nYou can also call in four buddies to help you out: D-Horse to move fast and undetected, D-Dog to distract enemies and detect plants and wildlife, Quiet to scout environments and snipe, D-Walker to attack outposts when violence is needed. Each one of them is important, and simply changing buddy changes how you play a mission or Side Op.\nEach mission is unique and has relevant bits of story that unlock at the end, and the Side Ops are varied and seemingly unlimited: extract prisoners, destroy heavy infantry, find blueprints, capture animals... Every mission feels relevant, and not put in just to fill a void, something that most open world games do.\nYou can also develop Mother Base, where the soldiers that you extract go, to develop new weapons, items and outfits. You can also deploy combat units to complete some missions to get more currency and items. You can also explore Mother Base to increase morale, take a shower, find emblem parts and diamonds and complete target practice. You can also customize weapons in every single part (after finding the legendary gunsmith), your buddies, your helicopter and your vehicles.\nI just love the amount of detail and depth that is put in the gameplay, making this the most accessible and complete gameplay in a Metal Gear ever.\n\nCHALLENGEThe more you play the game, the smarter the enemies become: you like headshots? They will start using helmets to protect themselves. You enjoy lurking in the night? They will use night vision goggles. The fact that the enemy adapts to your strategy makes every encounter challenging and fresh, and even though your health regenerates, you can't stand behind cover because they will throw grenades or send shielded enemies to kill you. However, you have enough firepower and possibilities to defeat this enemies and escape when everything goes south, making everything more enjoyable rather than frustrating.\n\nSOUNDThe voice acting is superb: like him or not, Kiefer Sutherland is very good as Big Boss (even though he mostly talks in the cassette tapes), and Robin Atkin Downes, Troy Baker and another voice actors do a fantastic job as always. The sound effects are also brilliant, with each gun and footstep never feeling out of place.\nAnd the soundtrack. I LOVE this soundtrack. Listening to Take On Me while infiltrating a camp, having The Final Countdown while you are riding your horse with bullets flying all around you are just some of the great memories that the music in the game helps enhance. You can also add your own music, which is always a nice touch.\n\nREPLAYABILITYTons of missions, 42 achievements, the upcoming multiplayer and the FOBs make this a game that you will play for at least 100 hours.\n\nOverall, this is one of the most enjoyable open world games I've ever played. If you love the Metal Gear games, you will have a ton of fun with the excellent gameplay and multiple possibilities to complete missions. Even though the story isn't as strong as the other games, it still is very much interesting and it ties many loose ends. If you like open world games, third-person shooters, stealth games and Metal Gear, this is a must-buy.\nThank you Kojima for changing mine, and many other gamers' lives.\n\nStory: 9\nGraphics: 10\nGameplay: 10\nChallenge: 9.5\nSound: 10\nReplayability: 10\n\nENJOYMENT: 10\nFRUSTRATION: 5.5\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\nSubscribe to my channel\nLike on Facebook\n{LINK REMOVED}Check my official website\nJoin my Steam group","September 8, 2015","true","326.6"," 29 of 46 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","29","46","0","0"

What followed were repetitive mission in an “open world” in and around a dusty mid 80s Afghanistan. Where are all the awesome cinematic pieces and incredible boss moments? Sure the character of Quiet is fun but there are literally only a handful of actual cut scenes in the game. Now I understand why this game has been praised so well by critics and fans and that is because of the breath of content there is available and  there is a big world to get lost in.\n\nBut personally I am cut from a different cloth and prefer more narrative in my games. I like a thrill ride that I can settle into enjoy every moment and at the end of 10 hours sit back and think about what I just experienced.\n\nIt also has to do with time, I am married with kids have a day job as a teacher and a night job as a games reviewer. I simply do not have time to devote many hours any more into one game.\n\nSo don’t get me wrong I can see how both games are good but I personally felt the repetitive and tedious nature of the majority of the missions in both games has soured me to the future of anything open world. I want story lines that have been carefully crafted not ones where I have to fill in the blanks.","September 10, 2015","false","11.3"," 49 of 83 people (59%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","59","49","83","4","17"

But what about the rest? It's awesome.\n\nThe Phantom Pain is a new entry in the Metal Gear Solid series that tries something new, instead of being the same linear, cinema-like experience. It introduces open-world gameplay, base management seen in Peace Walker and interesting new mechanics. Plot-wise, it plays like a TV show, meaning that the narration is not involved in just one plot throughout the entire game.\nThe storyline is, once again, about the legendary soldier Big Boss, waking up after a nine-year coma. The story and other sub-plots are awesome in my opinion, but admittedly not necessary to the entire Metal Gear Solid saga.\n\nPROS+ Open-world infiltration with superb and varied gameplay.\n+ Rich storyline with stunning cutscenes.\n+ Ability to manage your bases and staff.\n+ A lot of secondary activities and challenges to do.\n+ Online invasions.\n+ Great PC port.\n\nCONS- Cut content: the last mission has been removed for the final release (Mission 51). It ends a sub-plot, but still quite important to the MGS universe. It involves Eli and Metal Gear itself after they've escaped from your base, and leaving this sub-plot open is bad in my opinion. Game files also reveal an image of a chapter 3 called "peace", although players think the entire plot's chapter has been integrated into chapter 1 and 2 as side-ops.\n- Open-world maps feel lifeless. There are no enemy choppers, tanks, snipers and walker gears roaming around the map, they only appear in missions. More wildlife would have been better outside bases too.\n- Compared to other MGS games, The Phantom Pain has less "Kojima-moments", dull boss battles (except Metal Gear) and lack of character development.\n- AI is totally predictable, and sometimes dumb.\n- FOB is unbalanced, especially when the defender joins and it's instantly game over. My experience was more frustrating than anything.\n- Inability to replay all missions + free-roam around on Extreme difficulty and Subsistence difficulty.\n\nPersonal rating: 78/100\nI would have rated it 80 if Mission 51 was included in the game.\nMetal Gear Solid V is nonetheless a great game, and a memorable experience. It has its problems, but the gameplay is infiltration at its finest and overall massive. Not too incomplete and not terrible as other people say.","September 20, 2015","true","178.3"," 56 of 96 people (58%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","58","56","96","5","4"

Even though it is said that people who have never played MGS before may play The Phantom Pain, I would strongly recommend getting acquainted with MGS 3, Portable Ops, and Peace Walker first.\n\nThe gameplay is where The Phantom Pain really shines. There are many games where you can either use stealth or annihilate everything, but the beauty of MGS V is the number of possible ways to do that. However, sometimes the game may feel kinda easy, especially when ignoring stealth and using a wide range of destructing weaponry and high tech gadgets.\n\nThe amount of content is amazing. It took me about 100 hours to beat the game, including a lot of side ops and some online play (FOB missions). Side ops are fun, but honestly they get a bit tedious after a while. Metal Gear Online 3 (the proper multiplayer component) isn't out yet, and with it, The Phantom Pain would be even better.\n\nMany say the story is unfinished. Unfortunately, I must agree. Don't get me wrong: the existing story is great, but it's obviously lacking essential parts (mainly at the end). Still, it’s an early game in terms of overall chronology, so if you’ve played the previous MGS games, then you already know what is going to happen.","December 13, 2015","true","204.8"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","2"

I was expecting a good game since I'd read the reviews, and it didn't disappoint. At all.\n\nI've not finished it yet so I can't comment on the entire story, but I think I have played enough to write the review.\n\nI would like to list some pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n1. Great gameplay.\n2. Immersive stealth mechanic. You literally have to watch your back. You need to take everything into account, time of the day, weather conditions, situation of the infelteration area, etc. It's far better than Assassin's Creed's "climb onto a ledge and hit everyone with throwing knives".\n3. Large open world map. I like open world games. My favorite games are open world, Witcher 3, GTA V, etc. So I liked this about this game.\n4. Great graphics. It looks great! Large draw distance, great textures, lighting, shadows... etc.\n5. Amazingly well optimized. I've a got single R9 280X (overclocked) and a FX-8320 (overclocked), 16 GB of RAM, and a 1080p monitor. I only need to drop Post Processing, Lighting and Effects to High, everything else in on Extra high, and I get 60 FPS 99% of the time. Amazinngly enough, it only uses 4.5 GB of RAM! GTA fills up nearly 8 GB! I wish more games were as well optimized as this.\n6. Interesting Story. I've not finished the game, but I'm already hooked on the story. And it's also very long. 19 hours in and I've finished like 7%. I admit, I did ♥♥♥♥ around a bit, and had to do some things multiple times because enemy discovered me, but still.\n7. Great soundtracks.\n8. Fun Online multiplayer. I admit, I suck at it, but it's fun. If you just play it for fun, like I do, it'll deliver.\n9. Great with both controller and KB/M. I play the single player with a controller, and multiplayer with mouse and keyboard. Both controlls are good.\n10. Mod support.\n11. You can order your horse to take a ♥♥♥♥.\n\nCons:\n1. Konami is a ♥♥♥♥.\n2. No ability to quicksave, far off checkpoints.\n3. Some missions are repetitive.\n4. Story is said to be unfinished, and that's why Konami fired Kojima, apparently he wanted more budget to finish it, and Konami said no.\n\nI got for 30$ on its most recent sale. Would I have bought it for 60$? probably not, since I'm poor. Should you buy it for 60$? If you can, definitely.","February 5","true","137.4"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

It gives you a great degree of freedom despite its roots in this genre, meaning there are many viable ways to play besides a pure stealth approach. Becoming the commander of mother base and experiencing ownership and management a private miltary force is something that drew me in and made me want to constantly improve my bases forces through success in the field and on missions. The story is what you'd expect from Metal Gear - quirks, some hand waving, but it has some very great moments and is overall an enjoyable look into the world of Metal Gear. While there's a substantial amount of content that is well worth the price, the story is noticably lacking/unfinished at the end. However, it's pretty obvious Kojima isn't to blame for this.\n\nFuKonami","December 22, 2015","true","132.9"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","1"

I have played MG1, MG2, MGS1, MGS2, MG3 (my favourite), MGS Peace Walker, MGSV: Ground Zeroes and this one. I loved all of them and I was really looking forward playing this game.\n\nIt took me ~160hrs to finish this game, mostly because I was taking my sweet sweet time with it and I loved every second of it. The story (without spoilers) isn't what I expected, but after some time I will appreciate it more than I did at the first playthrough. Gameplay is amazing, I would say that it is the best gameplay I have ever seen in a game with third person perspective, they really did a wonderful job with that! This is an open world game and by that people would expect a living world with things happening in it. Well, not in this game. If you're not doing mission stuff, just exploring an open world, you will find a big, empty world with nothing to do.\n\nIf it comes down to story missions, you can replay them as much as you want, which is great, as some missions may be too difficult at the first time or maybe you want these S ranks in all the main missions. There's ton of weapons, gear and other gadgets. I still haven't got them all. Plus Konami is making FOB events where you can get pretty cool items or uniforms and colours by completing them which makes players keep playing the game.\n\nMetal Gear Online 3, a online component of the game came out four months later on PC than it did on consoles. It came out on 13th Jan 2016 if a form of beta to be more specific. A week later it officially came out. I am really enjoying MGO3 and some people may be saying otherwise. It is a great FREE addition which make the game even more fun.\n\nPlease, do yourself a favour and buy this game if you love stealth games!","January 20","true","261.0"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

I agree, yes, you are entitled to your opinion and have every right to rate this game how you wish, the publishers and developers will probably value it more than you value the game. But just because you have a whim, don't give it a NEGATIVE review, in my opinion, a negative review is a big thing, if a game lets me down but I still enjoy it enough to play it even a little, I just don't write a review at all. The only game I have given a negative review to is CoD Ghosts and we all know what a ♥♥♥♥up that was.\n\nHere we have a game which is so beautifully optimised, it runs smooth as a hot knife through butter. The gameplay is engaging, and to people who are saying that missions are repetitive probably don't see the little changes, the subtle nuances here and there as the game progresses and the behaviour of the enemies change, their armour and behaviour alter with your style of gameplay, which, as far as I am concerned is phenomenal. The little details here and there have won my heart, such as making your horse poopypie and being able to hear the enemy radio chatter and beong able to understand it only after you have extracted an interpreter.\n\n\nTldr? This is a real gem, or shall I say DIAMOND of a game...hehe..anyway yes, get it, don't go for the misleading reviews, the people who have given it a negative review despite having good reasons themselves cannot get enough of this game.\n\nA Hideo Kojima game, but won't say ♥♥♥♥ you konami. Because I did give them my money to play this game, if you hate them so much then don't use their product, don't enter into a transaction between them, direct or indirect.. respect your own hate enough to hate truly.\n\n\nFinal edit- After completing the game and spending a lot of time on it and finishing it, I can finally say, I understand why it got the hate, I will honestly disclose that I am not a long standing MGS fan but..I can feel their pain...\n\nAdding insult to injury was thqt there was no promise at all whether we will get a finished product eventually or not.\n\nThe ending is messed up, repeated missions on higher difficulty, cut content, a story which we get in bits and pieces, it has been rushed...but I will still not take away my recommendation, I had so much fun with the game and yes I highly recommend it.","September 19, 2015","true","83.2"," 25 of 39 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","25","39","3","2"

But when you look at the major AAA releases of last 2 years or more, this is the best game released.\nPros-\nAll ports are very good and did not do any Arkham knight trick. The thing people complained was retail disc thing but which game today has the full game on disc. Arkham knight had 4 disks and people still needed to download 21 gb of data + future imminent patches. Metal gear needs you to download only 22 Gb.\n\nSee how there are no concerns about the bugs or glitches, because they have been ironed out. Unlike witcher 3 which was good but the bugs kept the game at bay. The optimization of the game is by far too good. You hear how Mad Max is getting good reviews on steam just because it's a good AAA release without bugs or game breaking glitches. Why not give Metal gear V phantom pain for that.\n\nThe story of the game is oh-so-good. You dont need to be an old fan of the series to jump in. I am not a fan of cutscenes too much and that's why I loved the game which lets you do complete missions in your own way.( You can skip the cutscenes and credits too).\nThe world of metal gear solid 5 breathes. You can not only compare it with witcher 3 or gta 5's worlds but in some ways it surpasses them.\nThe soundtracks and voice acting in the game are very good. Horseback riding was never as good as it is here.\nAlso, for the stealth parts, This is the best steath game hands down.\n\nNow for the criticisms,\nPeople complained here and there about microtransactions in Multiplayer. Well, consider this, the game is easily 10/10 only by singleplayer. Nobody complained when witcher 3 had only single player. It is not like you are totally put off by multiplayer if you dont spend money. You can compete and enjoy it at your own pace.\n\nAbout quiet, It has been too much time since I did not see women in games like this. People dont complain when in other games women wear even less armours, so please shut up about that.\n\nStill, it's a Hideo Kojima game.\n\n10/10\n\n","September 4, 2015","true","90.1"," 32 of 52 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","32","52","0","5"

All signs point to yes, and there's a somberness with that realization.\n\nThe journey of Metal Gear reaches its magnum opus in terms of a fully realized stealth action open world game which, by far, manages these elements with incredible results. Open-world is a saturated phrase. Games employ it but often fill it up with mindless side activities and content which gets dull over time. Here though, the tactics you employ for every area and approach are always refreshing. You are rewarded for thinking carefully and planning ahead. The enemy adapts, forcing you to change. The seamless transition of stealth to action makes playing an absolute blast.\n\nHowever, MGSV is a hodgepodge. To say it's a 10/10 is a misnomer. There are specific parts of this game which are outstanding. Gameplay, sound design, soundtrack, cinematics, character design, managing Mother Base, it's all quite incredible. There's SO MUCH CONTENT in this game, it's insanity. I finished Chapter 1, the first sequence of the game, after about 47 hours.\n\nHowever, shortcomings do exist in smaller ways. Depending on who you are, you might find the story lighter. Kojima is going against the MGS formula, which has been routed in tradition for a long time. Thus, lengthy exposition and long cutscenes aren't as prevelant. The loss of end game content (in terms of side character plots) is unfortunate, but something which happens these days with massive titles. There's also a true ending point which may strike fans or players differently.\n\nSo, the major impairments are some plot weaknesses. However, this was a major undertaking for Kojima's team and really his first crack at the format. Despite what controversies come from plot and a few errors, the game will be remembered for years. If nothing else, it's absolutely the BEST stealth action game today. It makes many other stealth games feel painfully inferior.","September 6, 2015","true","138.5"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

If you're an MGS fan who didn't enjoy Peace Walker, I'd say don't bother. If you're a newcomer, try to get your hands on Peace Walker before this. It'll make or break your decision on whether or not to buy this game.\n\nAlso if you support micro-transactions and MB coins, you support the Yakuza (Unfortunately the real thing, not the game series).\n\nClick "Read more" if you wanna hear me ramble/somewhat review this game after hyping it up after so many years.\n\nLike Peace Walker as much as I do? This is that amplified! You'll likely enjoy the new Motherbase mechanics and weapons you can develop. Not to mention the game is perfect to play, mechanics wise. Many ways to tackle missions, adaptable AI that makes you rethink about using the same strategy twice (Stupid helmets), and D-Dog. Oh yeah and that one sniper I'm sure no cares about.\n\nAre you a harcore MGS fan here for the story? You're going to be disappointed, no questions asked. In terms of story, you got cassette tapes that replace most cutscenes and... An ending with no build up. KojiPro made 30% of the game, and then ran out of money. Not to mention if you didn't enjoy Peace Walker, you'll only like half the game, as you have to micro-manage Mother Base very carefully, especially during a certain story event.\n\nNewcomers, I strongly urge you to try Peace Walker anyway you can. It'll make or break your consideration of this game.\n\nPros:\n\n- The first chapter of the game\n\n- Gameplay\n\n- Soundtrack\n\n- Next to no bugs\n\n- Buddy AI is actually good. Think D-Dog is going to be like Dogmeat? Think again! He specializes in stealth, and won't attack enemies unless commanded. Quiet, while very technical (rawr) and requiring patience, can be a lifesaver if you command her properly. D-Horse poops on command and will stop trucks you fulton. D-Walker is... A robot.\n\n- In terms of optimization, this will likely **** over every other PC ever made. Looks amazing, on fullout gaming rigs to potatoes. The Fox Engine lived up to the hype.\n\nCons:\n\n- Second half of the game\n\n- Ending seemingly comes out of nowhere with absolutely zero build up.\n\n- Missions can be... Repetitive. They're no mech battles from Peace Walker, but sheesh.\n\n- Boss bottles. No, the skulls or armored vehicles don't count. I hope you like a giant ape robot, cause it's the only boss fight in the game.\n\n- This is likely the last good (keyword: good) game on the Fox Engine we'll see. Enjoy it unless you don't like Peace Walker.\n\n- Huey Emmerich\n\n- Forced FOBs\n\n- Konami's business practices and how it affects the game. (FOB extortion, anyone?)\n\nWith all that off my chest, I hope you found this review somewhat informative. Know that I've been with MGS since 2010 and even after hyping it up, I was still disappointed at the second half of the game and its ending. Why do I still recommend it? Peace Walker was my favorite game before this, and gameplay wise, this is my new favorite game of all time as it's Peace Walke 2. Story wise, at least second half, not so much. If I didn't enjoy Peace Walker, I'd very likely hit "No".\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this! Hope you enjoyed it and are considering it/Peace Walker :)\n\nAlso **** Konami :3","December 3, 2015","true","259.3"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Odyssic/recommended/287700/","Odyssic","Odyssic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Odyssic/","788 products in account","Where to start?\n\nMy opinion on MGSV is pretty bipolar as on one hand I love this game but on the other I hate this game. As a long time MGS fan, I can't say this is the game I was expecting. I didn't read anything about MGSV before playing, and when I saw it was like Peace Walker, I was almost already disappointed. It grew on me over time but this feeling of just doing the same thing felt like a pointless grind. The MGS brand is legendary for what it did, and for this to be Kojima's final hooray for the series IS NOTHING BUT DISAPPOINTING. I have respect for Kojima in everything he has done in this game however, the story when shown is excellent (though REALLY rushed), the gameplay truly shines at times.\n\nAs you can see from my play count (if I played it after, I finish the game in 55 hours) this is not a short game at all. This can actually feel like a very repetitive game, side ops are repetitive, heli is repetitive, some main missions are repetitive and the waiting for something to develop is repetitive. I sometimes felt like I was forcing myself to play the game, hoping it can deliver but it just never does. Story is actually left unfinished in some areas, half of me believes this is Konami's fault. The game sets itself up for WAY MORE development but it just never happens.\n\nI guess I have talked about the disappointing areas of the game, I guess I should mention what I liked about the game. The gameplay is excellent, really fun and surprising addicting to build your base to be as strong as possible. Before you go out on missions you can create your loadout of weapons and buddies. With the best buddy being D-Dog, I never felt an attactment with Quiet like most people, I actually don't know why people felt attacted to her, she doesn't do anything really. You're free to do whatever in MGSV, with the game being open world. It's exactly like Far Cry 2 in fact, if you haven't played that game, here is the best way to sum it up. You clear a guard post, you go away from the area and come back and all the guards are back. Every time you play, this is really frustating and what made me HATE playing Far Cry 2. So you could probably understand my frustation playing MGSV for 55 hours. When out in the field, you can extract soldiers for your own personally army. You can also extract wild animals, such as bears and sheep, this is pretty funny to see a few times, after a while you'll stop extracting these animals and just stick with people.\n\nThe story structure is in episode format, meaning it should opening and ending credits, this goes as far to literally spoil what is going to happen in the episode. For example: if you see Skull Face's name in the opening, you already know what is going to happen in the episode pretty much. I pretty much made it a requirement to look away during these moments at the start because I hated being spoiled in this way.\n\nToo sum up:\n\nPros:\nGameplay is good\nBase building is addicting\nSide story stuff is better than main story but main story is the focus.\nD-Dog\nActing is amazing\nThe game runs like a dream, one of the most optimised open world games I've ever played\n\nCons:\nEpisode structure is bad as it literally spoils what is going to happen in the mission\nStory is disappointing\nUnder-developed second half\nHardly any bosses\nSide ops are repetitive\nGame feels too long because so much down time\n\nOverall: This game is not the best MGS game ever made, in fact, I think this is the worse out of the whole series. However that isn't a bad thing, I still had fun during my time with the game, despite how it may look. I made some of the fun with repetitive side ops by doing them in different ways. See how fast I could do them as all of them are simliar in some ways.\n\nWill I play this game again? No I won't, I think the whole "it's like MGS2, it will grow on you" is just wrong, I have noticed all the flaws with the game, those aren't going to get better with age. These flaws are here for life and I'm happy with experiencing this game just the one time.\n\nThe question is, do I recommend it? This is where the recommending system on steam sucksssssssss, I would only recommend it if you are:\n1) a MGS fan who wants to play the final MGS game made by Kojima\n2) wants an open world game and doesn't care about these issues\n\nHowever I have seen people enjoy this game with this game being their first MGS game, so the disappointment might not be there if you're new to the series.","September 14, 2015","false","53.0"," 88 of 156 people (56%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","56","88","156","4","0"

If you enjoyed 1-4 and are expecting the same sort of narrative and gameplay, you'll probably be disappointed; same for people expecting an FPS or min-maxing folks who are expecting a huge challenge even when using the best equipment and companions. That said, if you played Peace Walker and thought, man, I really wish this had been on a console / PC instead of PSP it would have been great, this game fills that niche (minus the solid narrative of PW).\n\nI could write a lot more, but I'm still kinda dazed from playing the game for 40 hours over the span of two days.

It's not what we do that defines us, it's what we pursue in our minds.\n- Unknown\n\nPROLOGUEIt was a grim past over these twelve years. There was no chance for the PC community to be a part of the majestic legacy that MGS franchise have raised. Long years we've been waiting, and today, our hopes are fulfilled. Congratulate the arrival of the best videogame ever for our age - METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN !\n\nACT I: THE DUSKMy story of love with MGS started on a harsh note. I was a schooler back then when most of my friends had PS1. I never been a console type of player - I had NES and a few games on it, but that's it. This way, I could've missed any opportunity to try out the marvelous Metal Gear Solid - the 1st game of Metal Gear saga in supreme 3D (back in time). However, one of my classmates (which I dropped all contacts after we finished last grade in school, sadly) had the game, and he was amazed by it. And still, when he tried to express to me his feelings about the death of Sniper Wolf, or the image of Vulcan Raven, I was kind of spooked by a kind of stupidity it had in itself (as I envisioned it there in my mind) - a big guy with a "2-meters-long" minigun, got busted in such a strange way? and a sniper fight, where your character had to eat pills to... "stabilize". "What a pack of nonsense?!" were my thoughts.\n\nYears later, I had the opportunity to try the game myself. It was that "Win 95" version with the imbecile MP5SD gun with unlimited bullets, and - yeah - I completed the game on "Very Easy" difficulty setting but it was still quite a ride. Soon after, I had my hands on MGS2: Sons of Liberty, which surprised me even more. This was somewhere around 2007-08, I remember MGS4 was somewhere out there and I remember I was wishing for it desperately.\n\nLater, I watched all cutscenes from MGS4 and my eyes almost popped out - how outstanding it was! I watched hours of gameplay and still had a small room in my heart with a hope that some day, it will arrive to our homes for personal computers. But soon enough, they started to release games for PSP, and soon after closed MGO support. From there, my hopes were dead.\n\n...and then...\n\nACT II: The RiseThe lightning struck as Metal Gear Rising made it's way to PC and - none other - Steam. Right there, right for me. With Raiden being a "2nd Lead" persona in franchise for me, I was very happy that I could finally reach Metal Gear through the medium of my keyboard for once again.\n\nIt didn't took long as first rumours about the next installment in MGS line started to pop out. The presentation of the FOX Engine was almost a guarantee that consollers will get another "big game" soon enough. Initial mess with MGS V made a lot of people confused, including myself. Being honest, when I heard that mr. Kojima was encouraged by the success of GTA V, I was in panic. MGS goes open-world?! I was terrified.\n\n...What will happen with the classic MGS flow? 20 minutes-long cutscenes, clever level design, various tools that worked in a strict environment, character representation, dialogues? Wouldn't these arch-important components fall apart as the hunt for the size takes over the hunt for quality? and the most dangerous thing: wouldn't it hurt the AI?\n\nI was too much afraid the stealth gameplay will start to die rapidly with the game changing it's way from handcrafted locations to "open-world" areas. Probably this fear struck me because I never seen a good open-world stealth game before. All of the open-world games I could think of that were trying to implement this... Stealth was silly and dull in there. Of course, it played out most of the time. But it was definately not that quality level you will expect from an MGS title.\n\nACT III: The ZenithI was mad. When the first gameplay videos of Ground Zeroes were published - with Snake driving a jeep and flashing headlights... A holographic sort of interface from 1970s? A rescue mission with a COD-styled shootout? That scene with an immediate surgery? No, I thought it all went down the road. In my mind, nothing good could happen with game like this compared to the glorious MGS4. And yet I was wrong.\n\nAfter all the debates I had, I finally decided to buy a copy of MGS V:GZ for myself, to finally see what is right and what is wrong. And boy... I suffered. I suffered... a shame for what I thought of it earlier.\n\nOf course, it was very simplified. You could mark enemies just like Far Cry 3 (and vehicles come from there as well). You didn't had any type of advanced camouflage, or cover system, or whatever. CQC was quick and not that much complex. But still, it delievered such a great experience!\n\n...And now FINALLY about THE PHANTOM PAIN. Yes, I know: I talked too much about my vision, about my regrets, and about my redemption. And yes, I only played TPP for about 4 hours or so at the moment of putting this text together. But I can safely tell you this: it's is the best event that ever happened in the modern history of gaming. If you don't really know, if you should get this game, or you shouldn't - don't bother, don't waste time - you MUST have it. For the sake of the world we play in, add this game to your Library right away.\n\nThe ammount of suspense, intrigue, curiousity and joy that this game gives in just three pale hours worth a thousand hours of your endless CS:S (or, rather, CS:GO), DotA2, Clicker Heroes or whatever else games you play on Steam. Get this diamond now, or you will never know what a true masterpiece of gaming as a whole looks like.\n\nEPILOGUEWhatever happened or will happen to the PC gaming, before or after, THE PHANTOM PAIN achieves the milestone never before seen to be achieved by a console port. It has a full potential to seize your time for days and months only in singleplayer, not to mention the insane possibilities to be found in Metal Gear Online. Tonight, I am grateful for the time I live in.","September 1, 2015","true","851.2"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","14","19","2","1"

The game just isn't finished. There is no ending. The still unsatisfying ending that there was going to be was cut. The major plot twist is a dissapointment, and completely takes away from the value of your *Kinda Spoiler* actions *End Kinda Spoiler*. Just not worth the money.\n\nGameplay-wise, the game is okay. There's a lot of ways to tackle the  story	 missions, but given what little is there, that kinda dwindles. The side ops are dull after after a while, and the open world is pretty much empty.\n\nI can't say I ever saw myself giving a Metal Gear game a negative review, but this game is just not worth it.

NGS V is one of the best games you re gonna ever play in this matter. but if you were curious about the story of Big Boss like me I do not recommend this game, yet.. Since we have a patch or DLC that completes the missing parts.\n\n\n\n\nIt is so obvious that a lot of content from the game has been cut off after the first  chapter it feels like a massacre , Game contains a prologue and 2 chapters,  You can feel Kojima's storytelling and magic at prologue and 1st chapter as they are just amazing and feels like a Metal Gear Solid game, then things go down like sandstorm with the starting of 2nd chapter. Its right out unfinished, you can literally feel the content that is not there like a phantom pain. Such a lust for irony.\n\nFrom the storytelling of prologue and chapter one you can feel that they story should have contain at least 5 chapters, and I believe it was what planned for at first. Because we are promised to see how Big Boss turned evil from the legendary soldier of Outer Heaven  to merciless tyranny of Zanzibar Land, we were promised a story that will tie lose ends. None that happens in the game.\n\nMy theory is that Konami pull Kojima off from the game after first chapter and finished the second chapter without him thus explains why the second chapter was such a mass and unfinished, and today we found out that a whole 3th chapter is missing including the unfinished 2nd chapter. As a conclusion Konami just wanted to release the game and get the hell out of AAA game industry.\n\nWe have no idea what exactly went down during development between Konami and Kojima Productions and the fallout that ensured. For all we know the game wasn't complete and needed more time, but Konami rushed for a September 1st release. On the other hand, Hideo Kojima had 5 years and 80 million dollars to make this game, and he failed to deliver a complete product. But again, we don't know what happened during the development of this game.","September 13, 2015","false","81.7"," 357 of 657 people (54%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","54","357","657","23","39"

Make sure to DL the latest drivers for your GPU. Nvidia GPUs can make use of better AO than what is available in-game through the Nvidia control panel by selecting "quality" for AO. You can also use MSAA through the control panel, which really makes the game sharp. Those jaggies in the distance are annoying when looking through binoculars trying to spot stuff.\n\nIncredibly well optimized, and probably going down as my favorite game of all time at the rate it's going. The amount of freedom, customization, quality, gameplay mechanics, etc, etc is just top notch.

Still only have D-horse as a buddy and no vehicles. The game is just so fun, even attacking the same bases over and over on different side ops missions, the enemy routes and patrols change. Their locations change, the number of them changes, the way you went in last time might be heavily guarded this time. Motherbase itself is just fun, capturing soldiers and having them join your own private army. I've barely even played the story mode.\n\nSneaking all the way through, deep inside enemy territory, only to have things go wrong, and have to run out with your objective blasting away, and hiding as enemy soldiers run past to see what happened, man it's just exhilirating!!! Anything and everything could happen at any minute. It's the best stealth action game I've probably ever played. Just look at some of my screen shots to see enemies walking literally a foot away from me, and going unnoticed.\n\nedit: I have a really hard time putting this game down.

The open world design and integration of either stealth or going loud worked out in the end. You have freedom of choice to tackle any situation in the game such as dropping a supply drop on an enemy's head, which knocks them out, to approaching a base/outpost with a tank and completely overthrowing soldiers. The gameplay is miles ahead of the previous games. The soundtrack is also very good. Compared to the previous games soundtrack, it's not the best, but it is still quite good. Voice acting in the game is also another plus. While some will disagree with me, and while I am overly familiar to David Hayter voicing the main character, Kiefer Sutherland did a very good job. I will say in some parts he sounds drunk but I don't expect you to exit the game because of that.\n\nNow for the negatives. I both loved and hated this game, but in the end I left disgusted. I, and many others, will repeat on how this game is potentially one of the worst Metal Gear Solid games. So much of the dialogue from certain characters seem so forced and unnecessary. The game is not finished. This game is incomplete and it ends with you having more questions than answers(in a bad way). The last few missions are repeats, and are just on "harder" difficulties. The side ops and story feel repetitive and you begin to feel like you've been playing the same mission over and over and over again. I could have looked past the incomplete game if the story was anywhere near the previous games. Again, no spoilers. Huge disappointment if you are coming back into the series expecting the same story telling and character development as the previous games. The story is mediocre at best, and the gameplay is what really that matters. If you have any care towards the story in Metal Gear Solid, The Phantom Pain is not the game for you.\n\nTL;DR - Gameplay is amazing, Story was unfinished & disappointing, a lot of the game feels repetitive, and the OST and VA were okay.","September 12, 2015","false","128.4"," 38 of 64 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","38","64","0","0"

Fox Engine is true lord of optimization. Using only one core of 4670k at stock it kept me up to 50fps at low and 40fps at high with r9 390. Using 2 cores I had smooth 60fps all the time. On HD 4600 at low it was between 30 and 40fps. Bless Fox Engine\n\nEdit: But for real now. Time to make proper review.\nAs a game it's wonderful!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WitcherPWNS/recommended/287700/","WitcherPWNS","Bender","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WitcherPWNS/","404 products in account",""Now Go! Let the legend come back to life!"\n\nI am a huge fan of every stealth game that I can get my hands on and I love to try again and again and again to do the best I can in every mission. The first stealth "game" I actually played was the first Metal Gear Solid demo many years ago and since then, I've been in love with Stealth. Funny thing is, never truly finished a Metal Gear game because I never  owned a Playstation. After all this time being curious about Mr. Kojimas work, I finally finished this one and boy, what a game.\n\nI've seen a lot of complaints that is the weakest narrative of all of the games, I can agree with the notion that it really is not that focused on the story, but if you really try to do all of the objectives I think the story will reveal itself and make more sense. The  funny thing is that because I did all I could, I got the "secret" ending in my first playtrough. One complaint too that comes to mind is the excuse to make Quiet use the outfit that she does, I mean, sure I'm not offended by it, but I find it funny that in the middle of a warzone there is a woman using a bikini.\n\nNow to the good part.\n\nYou start in a hospital, after 9 years in a coma. ♥♥♥♥ goes down pretty fast and you have to limp your sorry one-armed ♥♥♥ as fast as you can. You can only use stealth and cleverness to survive. And that pretty much resumes most of the game to me. Sure, you can eventually create crazy gadgets, but they will only get you so far (and lower your score if they are OP). One of the things this game does so right is the quantity of approaches you can take to accomplish the objective, I've been playing some missions over and over again and I can assure you, I barely repeated any approach until now. Even some missions can be done without actually doing what the mission description tells you to do. All and all, I think the most of the missions are masterfully done and that is without taking into account how the game reacts to your style of play, adapting to your strategy. Eg. you kill mostly with headshots, npcs are going to use helmets all the time. Last but not least about the gameplay of missions, there are so many techniques that you can use, that after 110 hours, I'm still learning new tricks, which is awesome.\n\nThe Base development, research and resources.\n\nI don't doubt that there are players who can finish the game without developing any new gear at all (except of course the ones that are a must, like better fultons), but if you are not that kind of Big Boss yet, like me, you're going to need better gear. To get better gear you'll need people working for you developing gizmos. And they will need resources to make gizmos. A pretty standard game mechanic nowadays, nothing out of the ordinary there. I have to say that at least for me, it was no chore getting better gear. But if you do not pay attention to it at all, obviously nothing will get done.  There are a lot of weapons, a lot of mods, gizmos, gadgets and the good and only, cardboard box. Oh and a important thing, research takes time, real time, real time playing the game. Yeah, not a huge fan of it, but hey, the longest one for me was like one hour and a half which can be done while you are doing missions (or not), which is a big plus. Theres this thing that people( other players) can come to your base and ♥♥♥♥ things up, but no real damage was ever done to me, so, just put guards defending your base and do not poke BAMFs with your pea shooter and you will be fine.\n\nThe Story\n\nI can't really say much without ruining it, but it has its moments for sure. They are not many, but also not just a few, a little more than just enough to be good. Not saying that it's ♥♥♥♥, but as I said before, not much going on most of the time, but when the narrative sets on, it's show time.\n\n\nAlways 60 fps with high quality setting in this i5-4440, GTX 760, 2GB 16 GB of ram. Smooooth.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt may not be the Metal Gear Solid that everyone wanted it to be (and no such thing will ever exist, I think) but it's a damn fine game. Nothing beats the feeling of going inside an enemy base, doing your mission and not even leaving a footprint for the guards. Or the sensation after a somber mission. Or beating the ♥♥♥♥ out of that bipedal ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. At any rate, MGS V The Phantom Pain is a unique game, nothing like it can be found trough GabeN's Blessing. For the lovers of stealth, it's a must. Sell your children if you must, but buy this game. Be the Big Boss. Demons and Heroes play this game, but only a few carry the legend on.\n\nKept you waiting for the TL;DR, huh?\n\nI played you like a damn fiddle! Theres no TL;DR!\n\n\n","January 28","true","114.6"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","9","10","2","5"

They are labeled "Tactical Espionage Operations" while the previous Main titles were labeled "Tactical Espionage Action".\n\ntl;dr: Play Portable Ops, Peace Walker and Ground Zeroes in this order, and get this amazing game.\n\nSo, You are Venom Snake, woke up from his 9 years coma to get his revenge from the villain Skull Face who destroyed the protagonist’s Base during Ground Zeroes story.\n\nPC Port status:Absolutely amazing, butter-smooth stable FPS that's not demanding on powerful PCs.\nIt's reported to work wonders with low-end PCs.\n\nGameplay:You have an Army and a Base to expand, upgrade and operate military operations at your commands.\nIn your missions, you gather soldiers to join your army when convinced, resources and money to build more platforms and unlock TONS of weapons, items, uniforms/suits and technologies for development.\n\nThe gameplay is extremely fluid and absolutely the best in the Stealth category. Nothing you can't do!\nYou can blow up bases, burn soldiers, call an airstrike, gas outposts, change weather or order a sandstorm to assist you. And that's not all, if you want to change your weapons, you don't have to finish the mission or restart all over. Simply call the helicopter to drop weapons, uniforms, items or anything to you. You are out of ammo? no worry, let them drop you more ammo. Oh and I forgot you can order cars and many types of tanks to drive!\n\nNext, you can choose a buddy assistant. You have a Horse that can poop to stop cars and soldiers, a Dog that can smell enemies and animals from far away, a fast Robot that can be fitted with Rocket Launchers and rifles and a big machete, and of course, the Naked Sniper Quiet with her "headshot-guaranteed" sniper (lethally or non-lethally).\n\nYou can also send your soldiers to do missions for you too.\n\nAnd later in the story, you will have a Giant Metal Gear to make these operations easier.\n\nYou have the absolute freedom to approach your missions. You can just go Rambo and kill/blow everything in your way to reach the Demon status, or get sneaky tranquilizing soldiers to kidnap them to join your army and finish your missions without anyone feeling anything. Or you can have both playstyles at once.\n\nThe Missions take place at Afghanistan and South Africa. Yes, you have TWO BIG OPEN WORLD maps you can free-roam. not ONE but TWO.\n\nThe special thing about these places, is the soldiers there don't speak English, you can't interrogate them for information, unless you get yourself a translator. so realistic it's so amazing to be honest.\n\nEach soldier in these map have his own stats and traits/perks. Ranging from E to S++. getting skilled soldiers will grant you a boost in your army that unlock new developments and upgrades.\n\nAlso, you can go Hunting. There are animals across the two maps, you can hunt them or Fulton them for you base, and some of them require a Cage to catch them.\nAnimals included such as: Bears, Donkeys, Zebras, Birds, Mice, turtles, deer, legendary animals and more.\n\nThe game has a good replay value, seriously even after finishing it 100%, I still boot it and still have fun with it.\n\nCons:\nChapter 2's missions are mostly old missions with much higher difficulty.\n\nOnline Features, FOB Missions and Metal Gear Online 3:\nThe Game also has tons of online-exclusive features. Such as daily drops, free gifts/soldiers/resources and Tasks you can achieve for more bonuses and goodies.\n\nThere's the FOB missions, basically a mode where you build an FOB Base similar to Mother Base but armed with security devices and soldiers. You can customize the soldiers’ loadout, and develop/upgrade more security devices such as UAVs/Mines/Camera with Guns/Motion Sensors/Anti-Theft Devices/etc.\nYou can also customize where the cameras and mines are placed exactly where you want them to be.\n\nWhen you invade another Player FOB, you have to reach the goal within the time limit while you kill/Fulton his solders, resources and armory equipment and destroy his security assets.\nIf you got caught, he/she will know you and can retaliate against you for a payback.\n\nYou can build Nuclear Weapons for those who invaded you and make them think twice before attacking you.\n\nCons:\nCHEATERS EVERYWHERE.\n\nMetal Gear Online 3:\nHas potential, but the game runs on P2P format, there are too much lag, most items are unlocked by MB coins which is hard to earn (login daily for few MB coins), and no strong anti-cheat system.\n\nThere are five game modes: Bounty Hunter, Cloak and Dagger, Comm Control, Sabotage and Survival.\nThey are really fun and I encourage you to play each of them at least once.\n\nIt's comes free with the main game, there's no loss to play this from time to time.\n\nPresentation:This might be disliked and misunderstood by many. But the game story presented as its settings, the 80's\nThe cinematics and cut scenes play and feels like an 80's TV show, minus the cheesy-ness. Instead the game is very dark and emotional and the direction is great and top-notch.\n\nCons:\nVenom Snake doesn't speak too much. Cut scenes don't cover much of the story, cassette tapes do.\n\nStory:Here it is, the biggest flop by many in this game. I will try my best to make this spoiler-free.\n\nOk so, The Phantom Pain story is a direct Sequel to Peace Walker and Ground Zeroes. The story is divided between pre/post missions cut scenes and Cassette Tapes.\nAfter the first missions, the cut scenes are mostly at the Mother Base, showing the interactions of the characters, their developments and motives. As I said before, the game is presented as a TV show. You will see the character talk about other characters a lot, planning against them or for them, they will speak to you about their worries, fears and pain.\n\nThe story is complex, like a jigsaw puzzle, you have to find and listen to every detail through speeches, interpreting cut scenes, character's goals and cassette tapes of other characters and then making the big picture by yourself.\n\nAs you might read, the story lacks Mission 51, the final mission. It's sad that we didn't get to play it, it's looks good and interesting, but it's in YouTube anyway, better than nothing.\nThis is all due to Konami's decision of cutting the budget of the game, firing Kojima and releasing the game in this state. All we can do is hope they release it someday.\n\nMGSV vs old Metal Gear games\nMGSV as a presentation and content is quite different than its predecessors.\nKojima used a different direction style here.\nCut scenes are not too long here.\nAnd boss battles aren't quite interesting as before.\n\nThose don't make it a bad game, the game is seriously fun and addictive. Even after 100%.\n\nRecommendations:- Play MGS3, Portable OPS, Peace Walker and Ground Zeroes before this game.\n- Install Mods, Especially "Ultimate Phantom Pain" Mod, you can find it at Nexus Mods.\n- Put your favorite songs in the CustomMusic Folder, and set one for your helicopter.\n- Listen to cassette tapes during Side Ops.\n- Change your style often, if you go peaceful, try to be a Rambo sometimes.\n- Always try different types of weapons. e.g.: Tranquilizer for Stuns, or vice versa.\n\nConclusion:\nIf you are looking for a solid Stealth game, this is for you.\nIf you more into watching cut scenes, narratives and easy stories, you might think more about it.\n\nMy Rating: 9/10","May 28","true","165.1"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Calamitation/recommended/287700/","Calamitation","Calamitation","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Calamitation/","427 products in account","There are MAJOR PLOT SPOILERS in this "Review". This "Review" is me voicing my opinions on Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain and I must talk about certain plot events and twists to elaborate on my point of view. I do not consider this to be a definitive absolution on the game, some people really enjoy this game, and I find it unfortunate that I can't enjoy this game as much as they do. My opinions on this game really hurt me as the Metal Gear series is my favourite and this game was a major disappointment to me. Metal Gear Solid is a series I've gown up playing, I've loved every single one of the Metal Gear games and I was really hype for Phantom Pain. However upon playing The Phantom Pain I was only getting more and more disappointed, don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the majority of the game for quite a while, however looking back I have noticed some things that I did not like.\n\nFirstly, the "Open World" is something that I find more dead and barren than the Open World in Fallout games. There is so little to actually do in the world. Your entire purpose of roaming the open world is to move between outposts, grab resources and occasionally cassette tapes. I also find it extremely odd that every single outpost, base and village only has hostile combatants. It makes no sense to me that there are no civilian zones or rebel camps or friendly combatants. There's even a mission where you have to assist local rebels by destroying a battalion of tanks, however you can never see these rebels, not even in that mission. Also "Capturing" outposts yields a very small reward, you gain some heroism and even a title if it's the first time you've "Captured" an outpost, but that's about it, you can't do anything more with it. I find this extremely odd considering Diamond Dogs has a base in the middle of the ocean, at least 700 troops strong but we can't call a squad in to guard an outpost we've captured.\n\nIt seems that the staff's only uses are having numbers that all get added together that give you numbers to make equipment or to battle numbers using a timed facebook-like event, and when they're not doing that they're just saluting you and getting beaten by you for being completely useless. There were Rebels and enemy combatants fighting constantly in Metal Gear Solid 4, I assumed that this feature would be brought back into The Phantom Pain, since it made a lot more sense, however this wasn't implemented, which I find very strange considering the previous Metal Gear title DID have this feature.\n\nMy next problem is the copy-paste style mission types. I feel as though there isn't enough variety in the gameplay. Sure you can adjust your playstyle - you even have to as the enemy is adaptive and counters your playstyle - however the missions are always the same. Every armoured vehicle battle, every capture highly skilled soldier mission, every armoured unit mission, they're just copied and pasted throughout the world and that's it. Chapter 2 is absolutely awful for this, for every Main Op mission you complete it gives you 2 missions from Chapter 1 with a new rule that makes the game slightly harder.\n\nMy next problem is the adaptive AI. I have always played Metal Gear games challenging myself, that means no kills, perfect stealth is what I aim for ALL the time. I feel that the adaptive AI limits what you can do if you want to achieve this end. If you use your tranquilizer gun and aim for headshots, the guards begin to wear helmets, eventually they wear body armour, rendering your tranquilizer gun completely useless unless you hit them in an unarmoured location, wait out the effects or shoot them multiple times, or if you're close enough to hit them in the face under their helmet. So my first few missions were done using a mix of CQC and the Tranquilizer pistol, then the rest of the game was played with just CQC and hold ups because my tranquilizer pistol was useless. Combat deployments can be used to minimise the amount of gear soldiers are issued, however I found it to be extremely time inefficient.\n\nLastly in terms of problems is the story. I enjoyed the majority of the first Chapter, I feel it was well paced and it really did feel like we were chasing after Skull Face from the shadows until it was time to strike. The presentation of the story and the way it ends is what falls apart. Metal Gear games were always known to have eternally long cutscenes, and when I heard that this was being changed I was kind of glad, especially after Metal Gear Solid 4. However now it feels as though the story is very minimal in terms of presentation. The first mission - the Hospital - was amazing. It was completely on rails but it gave me that feeling of an epic game which would be in store, however I found this the highest point of the entire game despite it being completely on rails. After this mission the game becomes extremely silent and barely tells us much about the story. The story is presented through mission objectives, post-mission dialogue and cassette tapes, which kind of sucks. The Cassette tapes are very similar to the codec, which I quite enjoy, but I never felt very in touch with the story at all, or my character since he never spoke. Switching voice actors from David Hayter to Kiefer Sutherland never made sense to me, even though I like them both, however Kiefer Sutherland seems like he had the shortest role due to the absolute minimal amount of dialogue. It didn't feel like I was playing Big Boss the entire game, which - SPOILER ALERT - isn't Big Boss.\n\nI have so much more to say about this game, some more about the bad, some about my mixed opinions and quite a bit of good to say, however Steam won't let me type much more. What I have posted here is what I feel most strongly about, unfortunately I have very strong negative feelings for this game. Hopefully Metal Gear Online will redeem this final installment of Kojima's saga.","September 15, 2015","false","150.2"," 24 of 38 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","24","38","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/allinthegame-gr/recommended/287700/","allinthegame-gr","AllinTheGame","http://steamcommunity.com/id/allinthegame-gr/","75 products in account","Well everybody probably has already played this game so a review at this point it’s not much of a use but I still need to write it mainly for two reasons:\n-One, because I can’t stand fanboys and game review sites giving it 10/10 reviews with 0,1 hours of gameplay and calling it a “masterpiece”. If this game is a masterpiece then what the bloody hell where MGS1 and MGS3? I’m a big fan of the series, I’ve played every game except PW but I can’t just shut down my brain in order to satisfy the little man inside me or satisfy my pockets…\n-Second, if they ever going to release a MGS game again I don’t want it to be anything like MGS5. This, in my honest opinion, should be made clear to the developer, the publisher and especially to Kojima himself by true fans of the series.\nSo let me get this straight first. This is not a bad game, it can actually be quite fun at times but it is not an MGS game and it’s not a complete game. More analytically:\nGraphics Graphics in this game are OK, nothing exceptional but not bad either. Also the game engine seems well optimized. I have an old GTX660ti and it runs smoothly on “Extra High” setting (the only one I set to high was the shadows).\nSound In the music department I am probably a little biased since I dislike almost everything from the 80s and all cassette tapes from the game where 80s tracks. Also the game doesn’t have a single memorable track/theme. The only good thing was that I could put, as a helicopter sound, the theme from Snake Eater and remember how freaking awesome that game was.\nStory/Characters Voice acting in the game is not bad on its own but the way they portray the characters is so much divorced from the story of the previous games that made the characters entirely foreign to me.\n-Snake in the previous games was a very talkative guy who would make funny remarks here and there. He was a combination of Snake Plissken and Indiana Jones. In MGS5 he barely talks and when he does talk he sounds like he suffers from some kind of depression. It’s unbelievable. Even in MGS4 which was way more emotionally charged game compared to the previous ones, Snake still retains a cheerful attitude. Did Sutherland got paid in a dollars per word type of contract or something like that? Also his voice was so distant to Hayters voice that only amplified the fact that MGS5 Snake* is not the character that we grew up with and loved. (*Don’t give me that crap that he is a different character because we already have the same situation with Liquid Ocelot in MGS4)\n-With Ocelot it’s even worse. How on earth did the narcissistic, sadistic, smartass, over the top character of the previous games became the voice of reason in this game?\n-And Quiet. Well what can one say about Quiet. Who needs character development when you have boobs? Seriously I’m starting to take the side of those half-crazed “feminist” people here.\nScene -> Mist incoming\nMe -> All worked up for a fight\nScene -> Female skull snipers that look badass incoming\nMe -> “Oh boy oh boy this is gonna be tough”\nScene -> Gros plan on female skull sniper’s ♥♥♥\nMe -> “What the…”This game puts a new low for female videogame characters. I enjoy seeing female breasts as much as the next guy but this is ridiculous. You can have sexual characters but put them into context (like EVA from MGS3 for example) don’t just throw breasts and asses here and there.\nI just can’t understand it. It would be logical if they hired someone else and not Kojima to make the game and make these characters not resembling in the least their former selves but "this is a Kojima game”. In fact it does say so in the beginning and end of EVERY MISSION! Seriously this has to be the most pretentious thing I have ever seen from a creator. Imagine if Tarantino or Scorsese instead of putting credits in the beginning and end of a film started putting credits after each scene.\n“Yeap that’s mine…yes that one too…oh this one also…”\nRidiculous…\nKojima pull yourself together man.\nGameplay This game offers a dumbed down version of MGS mechanics. This is both good and bad.\n-It’s bad because the game doesn’t offer a challenge at all. I S ranked the missions in my 2-3 retries at most. On the other hand Extreme difficulties in the previous games where hard to finish even for veterans of MGS series and stealth games.\n-The good about it is that due to the strange decision to make it an “open world” game it would have been a very unpleasant game to play otherwise and this is another point I want to emphasize. Why oh why did you make it an “open world” game. It’s not even a real open world game. It’s just open terrain with hardly any interiors (again strange for an MGS game) filled with enemies here and there and hardy anything worthwhile to do. Someone would expect interaction with villagers, Afghan and African little cities where you could help liberate from enemies and things like that. Calling this game open world is false-advertisement. The only in-game reason for this pseudo open world concept to exist seems to be in order to make the game needlessly long. Why do I have to watch a helicopter ride every time I start a mission, why do I have to wait 30-60-120 minutes in order to get a gun made, why do I have to wait for hours for a base development? If you can’t really make an open world stealth game I would much rather have the good old mission list…\n-Also the idea of taking things and soldiers from the battlefield and bring them to your base might seem great initially but it makes the game even less of a challenge than it already is. A big part of stealth games is the challenge of either hiding downed enemies or if you use non-lethal equipment you have to be quick and end the mission before everyone starts waking up. With the ability to extract everyone you lose a big part of stealth games concept and with it the challenge.\nVerdict I got this game for 30 euros and I would have bought it again for that price probably, but not for 50-60e.\nIt’s a decent game but not a great one and definitely not a masterpiece. If you change the title and the character names/appearance there is almost nothing to resemble a MGS game. I’ve also read that they had cut out content from the story (probably to make us pay for a DLC later) and it really saws. The chapter 2 of the game looks completely butchered with repetition of previous missions and non-connecting cut scenes.\nAs fans and as consumers we should not tolerate such business decisions and we should be critical (in a fair way always) with developers/publishers in order to drive them to produce better products whether we are talking about videogames, movies, music or literature. Blindly supporting something will only result in mediocracy.","October 13, 2015","false","241.0"," 47 of 81 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","47","81","2","8"

Cutscenes are less prominent than in previous games (except for the prologue, but it's expected for the introduction to ANY game to have plenty of cutscenes anyway), and missions are split. This means, no longer games where a single score was given to the whole playthrough. Each mission has it's individual score, and they can be redone if you're not sastified with the result, albeit with a reward reduction (half the GMP [money] reward).\n\nMain missions have the mandatory objectives to fulfill, and then hidden ones which are optional to complete but add up (either by score, or with personeel/gear). The game grants you total freedom on how to complete them. If the mission says "Eliminate x target", you can fulton him and it'll be fine (as a matter of fact, fultoning is preferrable to killing, as the targets are, more often than not, proficient at their job).\n\nThen you have side ops. These are missions which don't need to be completed to advance through the storyline, but whose rewards are so great that, in some cases, it's basically impossible to progress without doing them. Also, there are some side ops (tagged in yellow) which are still a must do anyway. Side ops are, imo, way more enjoyable than the main missions, since you have no scoring whatsoever for them, and you can do them the way you want without being punished.\n\nIn terms of freedom, MGSV is a game which, albeit rewarding stealth over action, still allows you go guns blazing and get an S score anyway (happened to me so many times). You can also just explore the vast Afghan world (not to spoil anything, there's more to explore than just Afghanistan), and take on outposts and main bases for new recruits, diamonds (GMP source), vehicles, and resources to build up your motherbase. Random events (sandstorms, rains, etc) will make it easier to infiltrate, but also harder to spot the enemy if you haven't done that beforehand (you can scout enemy positions with your binocs).\n\nThis game has more two unique features, when compared to previous titles; Motherbase, and buddies. While Motherbase isn't precisely a new one (already present in Peace Walker), here it's been reworked extensively. GMP is no longer obtained from recruits, but from sending them to Outer Ops, finding diamons, and doing Side Ops and Main Missions. It won't expand on it's own either; you need to order the construction of new facilities for it to expand, and such demands time, GMP, and resources. Unlike PW, you can also visit your MP, which is kinda a must since not showering will make you accumulate blood (more visible, can be countered by changing outfit), and will reduce HP and reflex mode time. While not mandatory to go back, some game events force you do it. You'll want to go anyway for allowing certain things to happen (there's a Main Mission which requires you to go back actually).\n\nThen, you have the buddy system. Basically, it's a companion which you can bring with you to combat. Only one is avaliable from start, with others being obtainable from certain events (if you don't do them, then you won't get them). They play a big role in helping you, so it's advisable to recruit all of them if possible.\n\nFor story telling, the game largely reduced the cutscenes and replaced the info delivery with cassette tapes (also getting rid of the CODEC this way). I find this to be a god sent as you can listen to the tapes when exploring the world or just wandering around your base, meaning that no time is lost.\n\nAll things considered (with my 50 hours worth of playing so far), this is my final score and pros-cons:\n\nPros:\n\nExcellent Gameplay.\n\nGreat Story (and it's delivery system. Not an overburden of cutscenes).\n\nUnparalleled customization capability for a MGS game.\n\nOpen world, non-linear experience, with results in basically being different for each player.\n\nMother base building (I love management, can be a con. Not too bothersome, just a two-minute browsing every now and then. You can do it while riding your chopper).\n\nAI will adapt and attempt to counter your preferred tactics, making things more challenging.\n\nCons:\n\nStaff morale mechanics (you have to go and see EVERY SINGLE SOLDIER to raise their morale. When your base gets big, there's no point in doing it. The penalty isn't that bad either way). Not worth the while.\n\nSome ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t moments, such as forced into doing FOB's at a certain moment in the game. Also others, won't spoil though.\n\nMissions can get repetitive, as the initial AI behaviour seems not to change at all unless if the specific mission plays differently from the rest.\n\nFinal score: 10/10","September 3, 2015","true","146.2"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

Venom Snake barely speaks at all, which actually acts to the detriment of the game, as he just ends up staring cluelessly and awkwardly in most cutscenes, much like I did after I finished the game. 2/3 of the game has been cut out, and that is not an exaggeration. The third chapter is not even in the game, and the second one just screams "we couldn't finish this, sorry" as it is filled with 80% recycled missions from the first chapter and  20% "new" missions that make you visit the same places. In fact, the trailers for the game have MORE cutscenes than the actual game. The trailers actually use pretty much every semi-important cutscene in the game that isn't "Snake goes to Mother Base to take a shower" and they even feature some cutscenes that were not featured in the actual game at all. The game also features these "moral choices" because apparently this is fashionable in 2015, but it falls flat considering you get a whopping 1 (one) "moral" choice and one illusionary choice that has the same outcome regardless of what you pick.\n\nThe gameplay, while probably the closest the MGS series has come to "true stealth", isn't without its' faults. The "open world" is really just 2 medium-sized maps that are mostly barren, barring the occasional goat and guard outpost. You get to visit these guard outposts/bases about 10 times or more, which makes them almost insufferable in the late game, when most of the game just revolves around you re-visiting places you've already been to numerous times. There is no "find a steam friend" function to the online invasion system, so abandon all hopes of playing with a friend. Much like Ground Zeroes, where it had the very tedious trials to artificially inflate gametime, this game has side-ops, extra objectives and animal rescuing, among others. While not inherently flawed as an idea, the side-ops are just dumb, with amazing missions such as "Mine Clearing 15", "Eliminate the Armored Vehicle Unit 20", "Rescue the Prisoner 14", the extra objectives work wonders when paired with the bad lua scripts that make obtaining some of them straight up hell (I'm looking at you, "listen to the full conversation between x and y") and apparently I was wrong to think that I could collect animals by finding them in the actual game and catching them. No, that would make too much sense. You find SOME animals that way, sure, but it's only about 30-40%. To get the rest (which you could have found and captured in MGS3 , mind you) , you have to place a capture cage on the ground and hope the RNG gods give you a rare animal when you extract. Great. Mother Base is mostly empty, you only really go there to see the occasional cutscene and maybe practice for online invading. The AI is also dumb. Really dumb. The "I just accidentally ran over a fellow guard with my truck, I should alert HQ that we have an intruder" kind of dumb.\n\nThere are many other points and flaws I could analyze endlessly, but the general conclusion is the same.\n\nI'm not sure whether it's because Kojima and Konami had a falling out or if Kojima just lost his writing ability ever since MGS4, but this is the weakest Metal Gear game in terms of story.\n"But, you don't have to enjoy the story! You can just play the game!" I hear people cry.\nSure, why would anyone enjoy the story in a game series that is famous for the length of its' cutscenes and its' story?\n\nBe that as it may, the satisfaction of playing as Big Boss, the legendary mercenary, really goes down when you you find out that you're actually just "some guy" who is in pretty much every sense of the word "Big Boss" except that the story dictates that he's not just to shove a weak plot twist down your throat and to make some dumb point about the title of "Big Boss".","September 12, 2015","false","149.4"," 178 of 326 people (55%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","55","178","326","10","14"

(not taking into account spin-offs like acid or non canon games like snake's revenge and portable ops).\n\nControls are responsive, fluid and comfortable and not absurdly complicated like in MGS3. Plays more like mgs4 which is a good thing. During first hours game feels really fresh and interesting\n\nNow for the bad things.\n\nopen world is empty, infiltration routes are mostly obvious and not variative unless you have a deathwish or try to play smart a** and sneak through way not planned by developers. Kojima may have invented stealth genre, but was not talented enough to reinvent open world gaming. Tthere is too much big players in this field and it's hard to beat them. All complaints about game's open world are not unheard of in the "bad GTA clone" subgenre.\n\nFox AI is a simple script. In the later game if you dare to throw one gas grenade - people all over the globe will start wearing gas masks. same goes for headshots and pretty much every other way you can deal with enemy. (no matter that all witnesses were carried away by balloon) pinnacle of douchedom is riot gear soldiers (note to ALL stealth games creators - these guys are NOT funny). System actually works pretty well and adds more challenge, except for riot gear.\n\nall side ops are not just repetitive, they are virtually the same mission that repeats over and over and over again. I hope you REALLY like Shago village, because you will be seeing it many many times. Developers were tooo lazy to even randomise your target's location.\n\nStory related missions are better, but the story itself is a complete joke. All events, tech, characters and locations completely brake metal gear timeline. Sahelantropus makes REX look like a prehistoric toaster. I was sincerely expecting, that at some point we will see a more advanced version of MG RAY, tech in phantom pain outperforms even the metal gear rising tech.\nExplanations given after the end of the main storyline leave a feeling that someone was making out excuses to put every possible character from other games into PP.\nAnd yes, before outer heaven big boss had yet another motherbase and private army, kinda big deal.\nAll of this ends in a worst retcon in history. Thought "Guns of the patiots" ending was bad? Think again (i am only talking only about "naked sin/naked son" chapter. pretend, that it's never existed and you're good)\n\nCutscenes are kinda cool, but are directed in a completely different way from other games. Again - instead of evolution we got revolution. No more camera angles changing and feeling of a movie montage. Feels more like "Cloverfield"\n\nAll buddies, exсept your horse are too unbalanced, dog, which spots enemies through walls from 150 meters, sniper, who can single handedly take out entire base of enemies. And they don't even prevent you from gaining an S rank. Once i got S rank for not being spotted just because qiet killed every single enemy with anti materiel rifle.\n\nMotherbase research projects are vast and useful, but sometimes absurd. Why do i need a completely separate research, to have a silencer on my svd if a just can screw silencer from another rifle? Of course this requires a legendary gunsmith for some reason but it is still a better way.\n\nAbout fultoning i'l just say "EH" it moves game balance towards non-lethal weapons, but you cant complain that you can send bodies to orbit instead od hiding them.\nMB management isn't annoying or difficult, so it can actually entertain you. Combat deployment metagame is just complicated enough to make you feel a leader of a combat unit but not make you bored or upset by micromanagement.\n\nAnd don't forget "A HIDEO KOJIMA MISSION IN A HIDEO KOJIMA GAME IN A HIDEO KOJIMA FOX ENGINE A HIDEO KOJIMA HIDEO KOJIMA AND A SPECIAL GUEST A HIDEO KOJIMA A HIJIMA KODEO A HIDEO KOJIMA IS A GOD" every 10 minutes.

Gunplay feels very sloppy and is very different from GZ. The AI is very dumb and blind. Most of the story is missing and cut from the game. Alot of the important story parts are put in tapes which shouldn't be, it should be put in a proper scene. The open world is very dull, I expected to see civillians, rebels (the mujahdeens) and small things like tents but all we get is an empty desert full of Russians. The sound track of V is pretty good, it has some pretty good songs like "The man who sold the world" and "Nuclear". Now let's talk about the FOB or the new Mother Base which you get to walk around, it's pretty empty just a few soldiers walking around and you need FOB coins to make new FOBs and you need in real life money for that. You can also raid FOBs and steal their resources which is fun for the first time.\n\nMultiplayer\nIf you are gonna buy this game for the multiplayer, just don't. The new MGO is horrible, it has a poor net code and micro transactions for cosmetics. The multiplayer maps are pretty good. The walker gears are unbalanced anyone who can't play the game can use one and dominate a server. The heroes which are Snake and Ocelot which you can play as are pretty fun I only played as snake and his gadgets are really fun to use.\n\nTL:DR: The single player is incomplete and only fun for the first few hours. The multiplayer is not that great since it has a poor net code.","March 8","false","82.1"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","12","16","0","0"

I'll just make a list without trying to ♥♥♥♥♥ out over how I really feel about this game\n\nPros:\n-Story starts off Solid...\n-Open world is interesting at first\n-Graphics are great\n-Animations are superb, maybe the best out there right now\n-Guns feel good, really great aiming with M+K\n\nCons:\n-Story starts off Solid, but quickly turns into Liquid ♥♥♥♥\n-Stealth is extremely simplistic and the game is very easy unless you gimp yourself (Even then it's still easy).  Durability on supressors does nothing at all except become an annoyance as the player could easily call in a supply drop for a new one/hold up enemies/use CQC.  AI is also ♥♥♥♥ and doesn't become better until Mission 30ish for some odd reason.\n-Open World adds NOTHING to this game, can't explore beyond certain areas during missions.  Could have just broken up the open world into levels and made the game a linear experience and you'd get the same result.\n-Buddies are OP as ♥♥♥♥.  As much as I love D-Dog, he marks every enemy for me which I don't like.  As for Quiet, as much as I don't mind fanservice, that's the only reason she's ♥♥♥♥ing in game.  She's one of the cringiest characters I have ever seen.\n-Kiefer Sutherland is woefully underused.  He has some amazing moments in this game and I think hardcore Hayter fans can even admire his work, but Kojima decided it would be a good idea to make an already established character a self-insert protagonist meaning he doesn't talk much, just listens.\n-Twist is ♥♥♥♥ing obvious, Kojima dropped the hint way too many times to the point where the player could figure it out before beating the PROLOGUE.\n\nI'm hoping I'll dump 10 more hours into this game, but even after using Cheat Engine to experience the various different weapons and gadgets, the game just isn't fun.  I bought into the hype and thought this game looked excellent from the trailers, but I'm just going to say this now.\n\nWhatever trailers you watched of MGSV, they do NOT REPRESENT THE FINAL GAME AT ALL.\n\nAbout MGO: Played maybe an hour of Bounty Hunter, felt cheap and a complete unnecessary addition to the game.  Imagine the resources that could have gone to making the Singleplayer actually good if the MP didn't exist.","September 19, 2015","false","42.3"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","14","20","0","0"

WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO?\n\nBut for real now:\nThe story in this game sucks. And not just because it is unfinished (though that doesn't help), but because it sucks in general. Both reveals are laughable and pointless.\nCharacters are lifeless and boring. All of them. Ocelot is the most boring of them all. Yes, they made Ocelot boring. And Troy Baker is a hack.\nThe game suffers from being open-world. Especially mission design. Having smaller, but better designed maps, like Camp Omega would have been better. That is why mission 30 was awesome and the rest sucks.\nBecause of the pathetic story and bad design the game has very few memorable moments - those are, in my opinion, the Paz plotline (as in "remember how fun Peace Walker was in comparison to this game?"), the Quiet plotline (Quiet is boring, but at least there is something going between her and Snake instead of nothing like with other characters) and the Quarantine area mission in the second chapter (I won't scatter your sorrow to the heartless sea).\nGameplay is great, but suffers because of the open-world design. A lot of difficulty is lost, when you can resupply on the go and use a variety of tools. So you have to limit yourself to have a challenge.\nThe game is unfinished. When you have to watch an ending to a big plotline on Youtube - that's really bad.\nStealing everything that isn't nailed down with Fulton is extremely fun and probably the only reason I tolerated the game for such a long time.\n80s music tapes are great. The other music is not very memorable.\nSo there you have it.\nThe game is a big dissapointment, and I really think it should not have been made the way it is now.","October 31, 2015","false","151.3"," 90 of 163 people (55%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","55","90","163","6","1"

Kojima next leveled us once again.\n\nI enjoyed the game for the first 5 or so hours. The open world infitration was a cool idea and I really liked how I could approach the enemy base from multiple angles. However I soon realized that there really isn't very much variety in the missions. The enemy bases just felt generic and so similar to each other. Maybe this is a problem with the open world design. The world is basically a bunch of outposts and bases connected with roads and empy land in between. While the older games were linear, they had better level design and areas actually felt different and unique. Practically every mission follows the same format. Kaz will recieve a job from some random employer and assign you to go to this location and elimate/extract the target, the choice is yours. After you complete a mission Kaz will talk to you over the radio about what he learned about that mission; this is where the "plot" advances. It seemed like most of the early missions are just random jobs that just so happen to vaguely relate to cipher/skull face. The early missions advance the plot extremely slowly and the later missions just throw all of it at you.\n\nChapter 1 ends and you're greeted with an unfinshed second half. The majority of the chapter 2 missions are just repeats of chapter 1 missions but with harder difficulty modifiers. Other than that, they are litterally the same missions with the same dialogue and events. Thankfully these repeat missions are not required to see the rest of the plot related cutscenes and audio tapes. You just need to do the few new missions and side ops to get them. So the seconds half is basically grinding side ops for cutscenes.\n\nThere is still fun to be had in this game. When i was grinding the side ops I gave up on stealth and played with some of the heavier weapons. But as a fan of the series this game was just a let down. I kept on playing hoping that it would get better but it never did. It seems unfinished and there are rumors that a whole chapter was cut out of the game.","September 12, 2015","false","95.9"," 82 of 148 people (55%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","55","82","148","8","1"

In most of the cases you can simply avoid or decide to not fight them.. and the story still goes on.\n- There are key characters in game which unfortunately you will never see in action, all rotates around you busy in a lonely journey to collect stuff from the maps (there are only 2 maps).\n- There are 50 missions of which around 39 as true missions for the story, the others are some of the previous lifted to a higher level of difficulty.\n\n< Lastly Mission 51 doesn't exist : the game has been ripped apart from its true final.. thankfully you still have a boss to fight at the end (guess what? a Metal Gear) but the fight between Big Boss and his son has been reduced to a mind war..>\n\nEND.\n\n\n\nIts an open world game hence is very repetitive (like 3-4 tipe of missions that you repeat indefinitely) with some cutscenes here and there to remember you are actually following a story.\nYour main goal, aside for completing the game, is to create a base for yourself and expand it as good as you can, this too indefinitely.\n\nWARNING: FOB system: after a while you will have the possibility to create a FOB (another base far away) with the difference that this one may be attacked by other players (human players). Yes, you may attack theirs as they can with yours.\nIf this happen the player which succeeds in a FOB infiltration may steal part of your -resources -equipments and (or kill) -personnel that you have collected in game to craft your bases.\nFOBs are not needed to complete the game so if you don't like this side stay away from it.\nLittle tip: seems you don't get attacked if you don't attack (sort of defensive mechanics for this system).","March 18","false","295.2"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","16","24","0","0"

The question every MGS fans want to know is, was it worth the wait?\n\nLets get down to the nitty-gritty business.\n\nThe Positives of MGSV TPP:\nExpands on the base-building and micro-managing Motherbase from Peacewalker.\nA true, open-world experience of tactical espionage.\nThe freedom to choose whichever playstyle you want and not be utterly punished for it.\nAmazing optimization & stunning graphics thanks to Fox Engine. It stays 60fps in the open-world which is a rare feat.\nVoice actors give off a more intense performance than the previous games.\nCassette tapes. I can listen to the tapes whenever I want to while trekking with my D-Horse in the night.\nThe Buddy system. Each "buddy" plays towards your specific playstyle and not completely OP.\nThe music is pretty awesome, even the tracks that you can collect for your iDroid.\nFOB provides an exhilarating experience in infiltrating player's base.\n\n\nThe Negatives of TPP:\nIf you don't focus on Motherbase, you will eventually get stuck where you'll may grind for more material/soldiers.\nIt's open-world but there's just not much to do. The motherbase should've been more robust but ends up being empty with nothing to do besides collecting some odditities here and there. The outposts are too few and small. There's also not that many memorable areas. It feels as if TPP was more of a concept of what an open-world MGS could be rather than should be.\nThe checkpoint system is aggravating where it's smack dab in the middle or right in the beginning of the mission.\nThere will be an abrupt junction to the story where you have to replay missions, some that are just rehashes only more difficult.\nThe buddy system along with the major characters in TPP will make you crave of at least interacting with them or having a conversation face to face. It's rather disappointing to hear just small lines that repeat or just another exposition dialogue. Even the main character will drive you nuts as you just want Big Boss to not be a mute all the time.\nThe AI can be terrible at times, buddies tend to be unresponsive and well, the guards are still the same.\nNo memorable villians or bosses.\nToo few cutscenes.\nYou'll start to wonder what happened to the rest of the content, as if there should've been more to it than just this.\nFOB is completely broken where only the defender has the upperhand and not to mention a bunch of hackers which would deter you from even starting an FOB.My Final View:\n\nHonestly, MGSV: TPP is a great game. But a complete disappointment. The gameplay is there but the story just feels lacking compared to the previous installments. The game feels unfinished which is sad considering this is the last Metal Gear that we'll ever get from Kojima. Rather than closing the loop of the franchise, it creates more questions which we did not want. The gameplay is there, you'll want to keep playing the next mission rather than putting the controller down. In my opinion, this is the best MGS gameplay.\n\nIt's definitely a Hideo Kojima game, but not a Metal Gear Solid game that fans have been yearning for years.\n\nShould you buy it?\n\nThe answer to that is yes. If you played Peacewalker, you should defintely get the game as it is essentially Peacewalker 2.0. If not, play for the gameplay which is unlike anything that's been released.\n\nIf you want a game with an engrossing and complete story however, you may want to look somewhere else.\n\nThis review will be updated once MGO3 releases and/or potential dlc.","September 1, 2015","true","252.7"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

I still have yet to complete the main story... and when I thought I did, the game slapped me Chapter 2.\n\nTHE PROS\n-Fantastic visuals that run well on sub-par machines.\n-The enviroments are massive and widely varient.\n-You can FEEL the 80 million dollars poured into the game's development.\n-The controls are slicker than ever before, polished from Ground Zeroes.\n-Forget all about how short Ground Zeroes is. There's well over 60 hours of pure gameplay waiting in Phantom Pain. Not even counting multiplayer.\n-The game has multiplayer. Two types even. One is up and running now and the second type will be up and running later in the year.\n-There's an overwhelming amount of weapons and gadgets that are useful and fun.\n-Realtime weather with day and night cycles not only look amazing but also keeps you on your toes as it changes your gaming experience.\n-This is the smartest stealth related AI I've ever had the pleasure of being frustraited by.\n-You get your own bases to develope, color, staff, deffend, and slap a custom made logo on.\n-This time, Snake isn't always alone. You have several support characters that bring new fun to infiltration and fire fights.\n-Feel like breaking from stealth for some serious gun play? That's fun too!\n\nTHE CONS\n-It's Hideo Kojima's Last Metal Gear game. For realz this time. Man, that makes me sad.\n-Microtransactions. Need I say more? It's skummy to put an extra pay system on stuff that's already in the game or to speed up constructing materials. Granted, it's not invasive and stays in the menus. You can also go quite a ways as I have while not feeling punished for not spending extra money.\n-Credits, credits, credits! Spoilers in opening credits too! There's 40+ main missions and every one plays opening a closing credits. I think it's likely Kojima's middle finger to Konami for trying to scrub his name so much.\n-The checkpoints are often unforgiving. There are times when you can loose 30-45 minutes because you made one bad move. If you were carefully infiltrating a base and messed up once... guess what? You get to start all over.\n-As smart as the AI is, there are still some bugs. Prepare to wait for your helicopter. A lot.\n-Konami. If they continue to crap on their big gaming industry in favor of cellphone games and pachinko machines, I see MGSV as the last game to purchase from them.\n\nTHE CONCLUSION\nBuy this game. It's fantastic and is worth every cent. 'Cept the microtransactions. Don't buy into that. Maybe buy actual DLC, but not microtransactions. Seriously.\n\n**POST BEATING THE GAME CONCLUSION (NO SPOILERS)**\n\nTHE NEW PROS\n-MGO is up and is fun.\n-New items have been added.\n\nTHE NEW CONS\n-The ending has holes, showing that Konami rushed the game.\n-If you choose to play the game offline so you don't have to deal with other players, the game now taxes your GMP (in game points) and heavily caps your storage limits. So imagine if Call of Duty decided to take away your bullets in single player for not playing the multi-palyer.\n-Now there's expensive FOB insurance that costs REAL MONEY. That's right, you spend real money to place insurance on your fake video game base.\n-DLC horse armor is back.\n-Snake's signature tux that has been included in every single MGS game is now in this one... as DLC because Konami wants all that fan money.\n\nIt's getting VERY HARD to not take away my thumb up right now.","September 9, 2015","true","108.4"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

That being said, it is also pretty flawed, mostly because it just doesn't feel complete. Most likely because it wasn't completed.\n\nA lot of people say there's virtually no story in this game, and I just don't think that's true. Chapter 1 feels like an entire Metal Gear Solid story that's much easier to understand. There is a lot of missions in between that don't exactly make the story flow, but I would really hope you'd like the Metal Gear gameplay in general because this game offers you a lot of it. I actually even told myself and my girlfriend that we should just consider Chapter 1 the end of the game and not expect anything else, cuz we would have been fine and happy with that.\n\nBut then, as you keep playing Chapter 2, you get sucked into the story. It seems like more things are going to happen and that things are going to get solved or change a little. Even though I knew it probably wouldn't go anywhere, I still fell into it, and its just a shame. The story builds you up to all sorts of things, but then just is over out of nowhere. Like it was just really very incomplete and very unfullfilling. I almost wonder why they didn't just cut the entire chapter 2 out, but I suppose that would be a decent amount of content wasted. This is a pretty big flaw and I really don't blame anyone for disliking the game because of this, but I find myself able to look past it since I enjoyed the gameplay and Chapter 1 so much.\n\nTo add on to the gameplay, the open world is actually really cool. I do realize that everything between guardposts and things like that is kind of dead ground, but it makes the world feel a lot bigger and part of something. My only complaint is it's just not fun to travel around. Most open world games give you a fun way to travel from place to place. Take Saints Row or GTA, you can drive around quickly and run people over or just narrowly avoid traffic while trying to get from mission to mission as quick as you can. In this game, you can't really do that. If you try to drive through an outpost, you'll almost certainly be spotted and lose a tiny bit of heroism for it, which isn't much of a problem. But then, they tell EVERY outpost and guard to be on the lookout for an intruder, so every base is now on alert.\n\nTraveling around just feels like a chore and you aren't rewarded well for doing it. All those complaints aside, I still really appreciate the open world aspect of the game and love that I have a big open Metal Gear world to do whatever weird Metal Gear things I want to do.\n\nI really recommend this game to fans of the series, or at least people who love the gameplay of it. The second chapter story is clearly not finished and I don't think it will be, but chapter 1 is great. There's only maybe 3 bosses in the game too, which is a bit of a flaw depending on how you feel about Metal Gear bosses. I'd say it's worth full price, but it'll for sure be going on sale to 40 bucks and below more often and on different sites, so maybe look out for that.\n\nVery  very fun game, but also very flawed. Tons of content, but at the same time, it's unfinished.","January 11","true","70.3"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","1"

But it is not without flaw.\nThe gameplay is smooth, unique, and breaths new life into the series in in it's final bow. It makes for a complex, yet easy-to-learn experience that transitions into open world very well. I absolutely cannot wait for Metal Gear Online.\nI like how it's also clearly a Metal Gear Game, and indeed keeps the same tones of large scale, atmospheric, eerie enviorments with a link to actual history and technology that, while way too advanced is still somehow fitting.\n\nThe gameplay, atmosphere, and the music are all great. Definitely enough to make this one of my top games of the year.\n\nHowever, my problem lies with the PvP and the story.\nFOB needs to be fixed. I really don't care how, just...fix the cheaters and improve the system. Make it something people WANT to do, not something they feel they HAVE to. It should be fun...not an inconvenient pain.\n\nThe story I feel is really quite lacking, but only in execution, not concept.\nConcept wise, the story could be something truly epic, and I feel like it ALMOST reaches that point, though only a little shines through in missions like Shining Lights Even in Darkness.\nSkull Face, despite just being a disc one final boss, I feel was shafted in terms of presence. After all, he did sorta kinda win in the end and pull Big Boss and Zero away forever.\nI wish there were more ties to MGS4's setting and the "dark future" of endless proxy war.\nI wish The AI, Sahelanthropus, and Code Talker all had resolution.\nIf the cut missions of the "Kingdom of the Flies" were put in, I feel like it'd work out a whole lot better.\nAnd I don't like how they played out the twist, though I feel it actually was a great twist conceptually.\nIn the end, it has a ton of great concepts, but I feel like it spends so much time working on it's own messages and story that it sort of forgets what game it is. As a result, I really dislike the story. Which I usually love from Metal Gear games, save this and Sons of Liberty.\nIf there was more connection between Parasites and patriot biotech, Walker Gears and Gekko, Doublethink and control of information, and just a little more focus in the right areas, I feel like it'd complete my love for this solid, solid, rock hard game.\n\nMaybe I expected too much, but as it stands I still love this game.","October 23, 2015","true","142.2"," 35 of 60 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","35","60","2","3"

Act 2 is pretty much a joke and act 3 was simply cut from the game. People who haven't played the game may wonder, how act 2 (according to me and a lot of other reviews) can possibly be that bad. The thing is, it's not really an act at all. It conists of 19 missions, where as only ~7 of those are actually new missions, the other 12 are straight up copy/paste from Act 1, with an extra restriction added to make the mission harder. They didn't even bother to change the cutscenes/talking for those missions, so it doesn't fit in the story line at all.\nAct 1 however, was in my opinion really amazing. The amount of content is incredible, and it just keeps growing the further you get into the act. New weapons, new functions, new teamstations, a new map and i could continue, i think you get the point.\nI simply can't imagine how good this game would've been if act 2 and 3 had been as good as the first, an easy 10/10.\n\nAnother thing people complain about, is the game being repetitive. The game contains 150 sideops, 50 main missions and an infiltration system called FOB. This is a lot of content, and repition may seem impossible to avoid in the long run. I would like to say however, that the game offers variation, it just doesn't force it. You can try out all the hundreds of items in the game, or you can play with the same setup all the way, that's up to you. This is not the only thing people find repetitive in the game, but changing your setup once in a while certainly helps. I'm like 120 hours into the game and still entertained, i'd say thats $50 well spend.\n\nTL;DR:\nAct 1 is amazing\nAct 2 is a joke\nAct 3 was cut from the game\nThe game offers variation but doesn't force it\nGame can last for VERY long if you're entertained by it\nIf you're a big MGS fan and care a lot about the story, you'll probably be disappointed.

This being that I have no drive to complete this game. I am 80odd hours in and have grown bored of the gameplay. Bored with the repetition, When I say repetition let me clairify how bad it is, the game consists of two Chapters. The first chapter consists of 25 or so missions loosely tied together with a weak, easily the weakest MGS storyline to date, The second chapter consists of around  25 or so missions, around 7 of which are continuations of the rather weak story while the rest are just repeats of Chapter ones missions only with new game plus style, make it a bit more difficult for the player parameters.\n\nYou can tie in some other boring features, the game tries to be gritty, child soldiers, now that's a touchy subject, oh but you can't kill any of them or it's instant mission failure, a few tortures scenes that make little sense in their context, a story that is just boring at best, I actually muted a long winded speech being done by one of the main characters so I could watch the Matrix Reloaded, that's how bad it can get.\n\nWhat else, well the FOB online aspect is clearly an integral part to developing late game items but the actual missions are tedious, repetious and either sit in the walk through without ever seeing an enemy or encounter fully speak super aware enemies at every corner and it very obvious that the pay to progress mecahnic is tied in to this aspect of the game, either that or be ready to grind, the same 40 or so sub, non story missions. Yes it does sound like you get a lot of missions but really they get repetitive quickly and if you stuck purely to story missions you could blast through this game in 10 hours easy.\n\nSo what else, The AI is weird, some times it is abusively stupid, other times you can fire a silenced sniper rifle from a unseen vangte point and the enemy will ping your location in an instant. Watching guard patrols, like in the old MGS is pointless since all missions turn in to tranq enemy and fulton him away so he won't be a pain later. The weapon choice is large and varied on the surface but most weapons just end up being unused since the tactics for infiltration all end up using the same two or three weapons.\n\nThis game has the most content, the longest potential play time and the most weapons of any MGS along with the online aspects but it is easily the weakest game of the series, The story is poor, the equipment is varied in apperance  but usually pretty pointless when used and the enemy AI is either comically stupid or frustratingly difficult the game doesn;t even have any really decent boss fights either and worst of all it is clear that the game is unfinished, that aspects of it (the entire second chpater) where padded out and rushed to get the game out before Konami decided to pull up it's gaming roots and give up on gaming.\n\nA tragic end to what was once a great franchise, ending on an unfinished unloved whimper rather than going out in an all singing all exploding song and dance.... but at least you can pay Konami for the privelage of having them insure your fake FOB resource!!!","October 16, 2015","false","99.0"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","14","21","0","0"

This game is honestly one of the best I've played in a long time.\n\nI haven't paid attention to the metal gear story as this is one of the first I've played since I was about 13. I'll be honest, the story is hard to follow for me. Maybe it's because I'm just stupid and not understanding some of it, but it is a bit janky compaired to others stories. Right from the start it grabs you though. It peaks your interest and shows you how beautiful this game is graphically. You're quickly coming to your senses as to whats happening around you. The voice acting pulls you in. The facial motions make you feel like its real.\n\nOccasionally some of the story missions feel like filler ones, like you go here and get one guy then you're done. Maybe I'm just misunderstanding the story again though. However when there are cutscenes it is intense. The story really progresses. Something that is known as a side quest, like getting a new buddy (follower) feels like its part of the main mission. Your buddys will be in cut scenes with you.\n\nThis game is challenging. It is honestly one of the hardest games I've ever played. I'm not talking about mechanics. Gameplay is straight foward and unique at the same time. Play stealthfull or charge in there calling in heli support while firing your light machine gun or hiding behind your riot shield. What I'm talking about is your focus. You activly need to listen to things or your mission could go sideways. Without spoiling anything, deep into chapter 1 something happens that you need to control or else your crew could start dying. It is not a mission. There are no hints. It is up to you to find out what is causing this to happen. If you don't, bad things could happen, but you could still go on without solving this. Little things like that make this game intense. They make you express your mental skill in acomplishing things. It's not just mindlessly pressing buttons on your keyboard or controller like many adults may think.\n\nIn January of 2016 there is suppose to be a multiplayer component coming (Not FOB missions, I mean like team death match and all that). I played metal gear solid 4 and the online component for that was absolutely amazing. I had never played anything like it. I expect it to be great.\n\nIf you're on the fence about this game, buy it. It is one of the few games on this market that is worth the money you pay for it. And please buy it from a source that will help benefit this company. Kojima really deserves the support.\n\nTL;DR: One of the best games this generation. Buy it.\n\nEdit: I've finished it. Took about 55 hours total. Not 100% complete but beat the story. No Spoilers, but it was disappointing. Very generic and left you feeling a "Phantom Pain". Not very happy with this in that respect.\n\nThat being said,\n\nGamplay: 9/10\n\nGraphics: 9/10\n\nCutscenes/Animations: 10/10\n\nCharacter design: 7/10\n\nStory: 3/10\n\nI still recommend this game because of how much you get out of it.","September 7, 2015","true","66.2"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","14","21","0","0"

BIG BOSS.\nMGS was made out of cheese dialogues,overly complex storyline that woud make your head explode and beautifuly cinematic made cutscenes that woud never end.... but HEY!\nThat was exactly what attached me to this franchise over all these years.\nThat was the main symbol of MGS franchise!\nThat was true MGS to its core.\nCharacter with a name cheese as SNAKE woud never gotten his title of ,,one of the greatest video game characters of all time,, if it werent for Kojima's corny writting and action/like hero portrayel of him.\nFor me the real biggest flaw of this franchise was that it was always a playstation exclusive.\nSo it atracted only a specific kind of a community.\nAnother flaw is that after first and second metal gear solid game it continued to favorite it's fanbase over wider audience.\nYou really needed to know WTF is going on in the sequals if you wanted to achieve that big effect on suprise and emotional roller coaster Kojima was driving us fans along all these years.\nThis kind of game used to appeal only to a certain audience of players.\nThose who hated it's long-overly dragged out cutscenes with overly-complexed storyline haven't sticked along to the very end.\nBut i cannot explain how rewarding it was to never get out of that roller coaster drive.\nIf you immerse yourself in it,and wait till the very end i cannot explain how rewarding it will be.\nI can honestly admit that there is no game out there that made me cry like a little sissy as MGS did. :)\nI litteraly took few pills after the ending of MGS4. (no joke :P)\n\nWhich finaly brings us back to THE PHANTOM PAIN.\nAn final installment for this franchise.... a final chapter for our unanswered questions.\nI watched the dev for this game over the years now... bitting my nails every new year to come.\nI simply coudn't wait for it any longer!\nWith every new update and progress it started to looked more and more unrealistic for me.\nIt simply looked way to good to be true. Part of it was even the fault on my way abow the sky expectations of it!\nI expected the greatest game yet ever to be released.\nWatching YONGYEA's videos 24/7 for new updates about it.\nThe gameplay demos along with the rest of presentation looked absolutily stunning!\n\nFinaly septembar first came! Aaaaaaand.... ?!\nHas it been everything i hoped for?\nIs this the new best gem of this generation?\n\nFrankly,for me as a deep (wont use word ,,hardcore,, it seems kinda dumb) fan it was kind a huge letdown.\nIs it a bad game because of that.\n\nFAR FROM IT !\nIt is still an amazing game!\nYou heard me, i'm thumbing it down and still saying it is an amazing game!\nSo what's the problem?\n\nYes,the V is an outstanding game on its own... it's just not an oustanding METAL GEAR SOLID game.\nFor what was promised and what delivered after it's release.... i cannot say it is worth the full price of it.\n\nThe good:\n\nSuperb graphics for this gen and amazingly well execuded gameplay.\nYou coud inflirtate the enemy compounds in any way you like,it rly deppends on your own imagination which is cool.\nThe soundtrack is also great... it kinda makes you dig that 80"s vibe again.\n\nThe bad and changes :\n\nStory is almost to non existent. What you seen in the trailers even before its release you coud almost connect the dots from it.\nBig Boss and Diamon Dogs wants their revenge agains't Cypher!\nAlong the journey BB meet and aquire several characters to join his army to fight for his cause and that woud be it.\nNo,srsly... without adding any spoilers if i woud about to wrap it up real quickly that woud be it from the start till the very finish of it.\nCutscenes from the trailer are mostly consistent of the entire game! Mayor chunk of the storyline was set on the cassete tapes. (which is another change over in MGS series,they basicly replaced long cutscenes/coded calls with cassetes)\nThe characters.\nComparing to previous ones these ones are mostly consistent of bland and emty dialogues followed by ,,only there to serve mainly as a companions,,.\nFor me every one of them was mainly one dimensional.\nTheir dialogues are mainly consistent on giving BB info about the missions. (that's basicly it).\nThere are side ones such as Huey and Code Talker. (which btw,are new opening who only expend the storyline providing us with the more unanswered questions instead of closing the gap for the final act).\nAbout the open world aspect.\nWorld consits intself of open wast terrain infested with guard posts,very few wildlife and wast mayority of emptinest around it.\nFrom one gurd post to another there is basicly,well.... NOTHING, in sight that you might find attractable to exploreable.\nThe desert and jungle is basicly (kinda) for me the very same terrain with changed ambience around it.\nMap is mostly generated of rocky terrain/mountains,dirty roads and shortcuts around it....\nWildlife is almost to non existent.... from time to time you coud run into some wolfs,bears,goats.... but that woud be it,and even those are very rare.\nThe presentation of the very first missions looked amazing.\nSaving and extractions POW's while in the middle of the missions you coud be intercepted with ,,mini,, boss fights such as the skulls was infact an amazing experiance. (for the first few hours atleast)\nBut after a while a repetativness will eventualy get a hange of you.\nBasicly the main missions (which are on paper 50 but in realy till the ending they are only like 30,rest are repetition of very first 30 only on the extreme mode or with the specific requirements to pass them) and then there are side ops which there like 150. But the poor execution and cheapness after few missions is unbearable for AAA game. Every objective is mostly repeating itself.\nI simply cannot recomm. this on the full price,on the discount?\nDefinitely!\n\nps: swing by the comment section of this review,i promise you... you will have a blast.","September 15, 2015","false","93.4"," 69 of 125 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","69","125","2","32"

No, it's not free. You have to pay for horse armor. Like, actual horse armor. I'm not making this up.\n\n*MASSIVE SPOILERS*\nOk, this is officially the most disappointing game I have played. I'm a mega-fan of the series, ask me anything about it and I will more often than not know the answer. I'm only going to be writing bullet points, not a full fledged review. I'm also only going to be focusing on the negatives. I'm not happy with this game, and I don't want to invest all of my time talking about why I don't like it. I have done that enough already.\nAlright, let's get started.\n\nThe gameplay is great but it's clearly 80% developed. There should have been more to do than the same samey missions that they tell you to do.\n\nWorst checkpoint system I have ever used. I spent a literal HOUR trying to perfect this one mission and I got killed by a tank. Ok, no problem right? Just pick up where I left off, RIGHT? NOPE. It sends me right back to the start of the ♥♥♥♥ing mission!\n\nThe AI is pretty much broken at some points. Guards and helicopters can literally spot THROUGH mountains. (This actually happened to me 3 times.)\n\nFOB's are garbage. It's not about stealth, it's about who has the biggest grenade launcher. If you are going up against a guy with one of those things, it's over.\n\nCharacters don't have there story arcs developed. Huey may have been the only one that was completed. (And it was very good.)\n\nAnd the voice acting for them is pretty off-putting or just downright awful. Huey, Code Talker, Eli, Zero, Quiet and Paz are the only ones who stuck out as being great.\n\nCode Talker says "The eyes of Kazuhira; a warning from the parasites..." This clearly means that Kaz is infected and that's why his eyes don't have any color but nothing ever comes of this. His eyes are never mentioned besides this point in the game. Nothing ever comes of this.\n\nGame rehashes missions and throws them in there for you to replay on harder difficulties. I know that you don't have to play them but they show up in main ops and confuse the player into thinking they are mandatory.\n\nEnding is god awful, the worst ending I have ever seen in a video game. If you played ANY other MG game you will know what a blatant lie it is.\n\nQuiet's ending was pretty much trash. I hated it. But maybe that's me because I like Quiet so much.\n\nNecrophilia scene with Quiet just to show how dark the game is. It doesn't add to her character or the random Soviet who tries to ♥♥♥♥ her dead corpse. In GZ the ♥♥♥♥ scene showed how disgusting Skull Face is, and how far he would go to achieve his goals. It doesn't add anything to the Soviet because he's just a random grunt who gets killed 2 minutes later.\n\nIn MGS4, everything was explained as nanomachines. Now it's "Vocal Cord Parasites."\n\nEvery cutscene is shown in the trailers.\n\nLike, actually all of them.\n\nThe ending is shown in the GDC trailer.\n\nEven the birthday cutscene, which is an easter egg, is shown in the short E3 2015 trailer.\n\nCutscenes are not as good as that previous games. Ground Zeroes had a scene where cutscenes could play out differently.\n\nIf you unlock Chico's cell and there are no prisoners (because you rescued them before hand) then the cutscene plays out differently than if you didn't rescue the other prisoners first. (Big Boss will be telling Chico too keep it down, prisoners will be screaming at him "Let me out!" "Hey! Help me out too!") None of this is in TPP.\n\nSpeaking of Big Boss, you don't play as him. You just play as some random pretty boy medic who showed up in GZ for 30 seconds.\n\nSkull Face is in the game for 3 scenes and then he dies.\n\nSkull Face's death scene is garbage. He gets stepped on and then shot in the face by Huey.\n\nScript is awful.\n\nAfrica doesn't have any lions, elephants, giraffes or rhinos. Completely barren of any life or animals the African wilderness is known for.\n\nOnly one emotional scene. Doesn't even come close to the emotion in the other games.\n\nBig Boss doesn't become a demon. In fact, they destroyed the lore so they could add a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ "Big Boss dindu nuffin" ending.\n\nKojima fed us lies.\n\nOpening credits during missions reveals all the characters who are going to appear in a mission. Even you are not suppose to know until later.\n\nThe way you have to sit in the helicopter at the start of every mission for 2 minutes is atrocious.\n\nSoundtrack is not as good.\n\nSins of the Father was implemented terribly.\n\nThe new MG can walk on 2 legs. None of the later ones can do this.\n\nNew MG has hips, hands, fingers, peni.s (seriously), and a sword that can make the ground shoot up big exploding rocks. And the sword can turn into a whip. And it's on fire.\n\nQuiet doesn't get the credit she deserves.\n\nQuiet and Venom Snake have an awful love story instead of a mentor and student relationship like The Boss and Naked Snake.\n\nDD is a walking wall hack. You might as well turn on cheat codes if you use him.\n\nD Walker is useless.\n\nStory is hardly there, and what is there is sub par.\n\nNo tuxedo. (DLC)\n\nDD Soldiers are all either perverts, idiots or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. I didn't really care when I was forced to kill them because I hated them.\n\nQuiet gets bullied by Diamond Dogs, even though she saves Snake more than once, jumps in a vat of chemicals to get a child's necklace and saves Mother Base from being destroyed.\n\nChapter 2 isn't finished and chapter 3 is missing entirely. (It was going to be called PEACE.)\n\nThere is also a rumor going around that there was going to be 4th and 5th chapter. I believe this to be true but don't take my word for it.\n\n3 bosses are in the game and they are not that great.\n\nLast mission is literally the first mission only 2 scenes are slightly altered.\n\nIshmael is actually the real Big Boss and NOT a hallucination as revealed in the last mission. And yet he some how survives getting set on fire, shot with 3 big ♥♥♥ LMG's (You can even see the bullets go through him and the blood shoot out and see him fall over) only to have him appear 5 seconds later without a scratch, jumps off of a railing to distract a guard and completely vanishes, GETS SHOT IN THE FACE WITH 2 MINIGUNS OFF OF A HELICOPTER (he actually dies at this point until they wanted to throw in that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ending) and gets thrown around in a car crash. Yes, he survives all of that without a mark to show for it. Complete horse ♥♥♥♥.\n\nAlso, Ishmael clearly has both eyes intact and doesn't have any facial hair if you look at him when he shoots the shower head.\n\nThe ending turns Big Boss into a coward.\n\nQuiet's death is stupid. She nearly gets hit with a rocket so Snake has to carry her through a sand storm. Snake gets bitten by a snake and nearly dies so somehow Quiet manages to wake up and call Pequad to help him out. But instead of using her super speed and strength to carry Snake out of the sand storm so Pequad can see them, she decided to call him in the middle of the sand storm where there is ZERO viability. So how does she die? She speaks English an order to guide Pequad to their location, which activates the vocal cord parasites and kills her later on off-screen. The worst ending for one of my favorite characters.\n\n\nI'm going to be updating this review as often as I can.

Like other metal gear fans I was really eager to play this. The game started out great. The first 90 minutes were absolutely incredible. I rarely felt scared about the consequences of getting caught in the first scene than I have in any other game. It felt like there was so much on the line and the emenies were merciless. The first 90 minutes crescendos and by the time the opening is finished I was exausted. I was ready to take a step back. After the opening my imagination was going wild thinking about all of the other experiences that I would experience like the first 90 minutes of gameplay. This feeling kept me going for about 10-15 hours when I finally realized there would be nothing resembling that opening again. Once I realized this I could not get myself to extract another enemy from a base or gain some special intel. So this is the problem I have with this game. For players like me, there is very little reward for finishing a mission.  In past Metal Gear Solid games I felt rewarded after a difficult mission with a captivated cutscene sequence. The cutscenes in past games would suck me into the MGS universe. It made me feel like "This is happening." This game does not do that for me.  A mission just ends and then you get a cassette tape to listen to. That's really it. Then you get briefed again. Go on mission. Repeat 50 times.\n\nThe game does feel really good though. The controls are tight and responsive. The game looks great. The gameplay is really good at first but wears me down after a while becuase there is little variety once you develop your own playstyle. The lack of reward (story) really makes the repetitiveness of the gameplay and locations stand out. I kept telling myself the game was going to get better. I was disappointed though.","February 9","false","44.7"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","15","23","0","2"

Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is a prequel to the original Metal Gear and the 11th in the overall series, according to wikipedia. With that being said, the character of Snake is not voiced by David Hayter as has been the case with previous Metal Gear games, due to injuries suffered prior to the immediate events of The Phantom Pain. Snake, also known as Big Boss, is voiced by Kiefer Sutherland, and does not speak a lot during the game.\n\nSeveral support characters familiar to those who follow the series such as; Ocelot Revolver, Kazuhira Miller, and Eli, to name a few, are also back, along with new characters. The gameplay is more modernized, and open world than previous installments, but this change also makes the game feel differently from others in the franchise. The Storyline is interesting, and keeps your attention, but honestly I miss the feel of previous Metal Gear Games in the series, so my review may be a little biased. As a stand-alone game without any introduction to previous titles in the series it stands on it's own two feet. If you are new to the series, you will find the gameplay to be pretty straightforward, to those who enjoyed the series, you will find aspects of the game to be similar, but notice a difference when you play. Overall it's not a bad game at all. The graphics are beautiful. I hope you enjoy the game.","May 13","true","32.0"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","15","23","2","0"

I Loved it, I hated it, and then I loved it again at the point that I sadistically completed it at 100%. Nonetheless I can't help but disagree with those Reviewers that rate it 10/10 or even 9/10. Don't misunderstand me, I really wish I could rate it 10/10 but I must honestly say 8 is a more balanced rate because this chapter is not a mediocre product but it's not flawless, nor it can compare the previous chapters (which can all be rated 9 or above...).\nThe most important premise is that I own MGS and MGS2 and I've loved them so much that, at the times, I went far enough to ask my friend To lend me his PS2 to play MGS3, which I DAMN LOVED more than every other chapter, and then I played MGS4 with my friend (they both were PS Exclusive - F**K you Sony...). And at the same time I really hated to play them because I'm totally denied with controllers. However When they announced the upcoming Ground Zeroes followed by The Phantom Pain for Steam on PC as well I was hyped like never before. The MGS Saga is one of the most important and innovative games which brought really great and iconic titles because of the great vision of Hideo Kojima that directed this saga's great story shown with a Holliwoodian cinematic styles, some of the greatest turning points, and an innovative Gameplay that constantly evolved...\n\n+++Pros+++- Gameplay. This is in absolute the best chapter of the saga. Investigating soldiers, dynamic reactions, countermeasures according to your approaching with the missions (if you always tranquilize with headshots they'll start wearing helmets in next missions, but you can temporary prevent that by sending your mother base soldiers in dispatch missions to cut their helmet supplies... And this is just an example). The character is so responsive and natural and now is moving inside an...\n- ...Open world. This is the very first chapter that is designed to free roam in 2 settings: Afghanistan and Central Africa. All the missions take place in road blocks, citadels, ruins, power plants and so on, which is some fresh new setting considered the previous closed ambience of buildings and the "fake" open-air ambience of the latest chapters that actually were room-designed. This way you can approach the missions in so many ways and from so many directions.\n- Direction. As usual Hideo Kojima brought us the greatest cutscenes ever. This time they're not exaggerated in lenght as in MGS4, but yet these are the best in the saga because of the engine and the hollywoodian movie-like direction tecniques.\n- Story. The Story behind this Game is interesting and takes place in the eighties in Afghanistan and Central Africa. It touches many themes like Private Armies, Child soldiers and Nuclear Weapons. But the best part is the End and the consequences it implies (If you know the Metal Gear saga this chapter takes place shortly before the very first Metal Gear "Non-Solid" For MSX2). Some hardcore fans might hate it. Personally I was afraid of it... but then I've loved it... Because it perfectly fits.\n- Characters. As usual I Damn Love the characters. Venom Snake, "Master" Kaz Miller, Quiet, Ocelot, Huey and Eli.\n- Buddies. This time you can count on buddies. D-Horse is your trusty Steed that helps you with long distance travels and in other ways; D-Dog is the best, most loayal and lovable Dog buddy ever best suited for sniffing nearby enemies; D-Walker, this cold piece of metal is a badass piece of metal equippable with high-firepower weapons; Quiet, Already mentioned the more you play with her the more you'll love her, maybe because I really took my time to grow my bond with her to quickly buy her a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ tranquilizer rifle to prevent her going lethal, maybe because she'll always watch my back when I'm in danger even if I didn't give any command, maybe because she can provide a distraction when she opens fire on enemies and they start chasing her.\n- Skulls. They Are Badass. Period. I've hated them all the way until I learned how to stealthly avoid them or kill them fastly.\n- Sahelantropus. Period (No spoilers)\n- Mother Base. You can manage from the plant expansion, to the staff, R&D section, dispatch missions and the customization of mother base. You can actually explore through all the mother base platforms you build where you can find your soldiers, hidden diamonds a few target practice missions and other surprises.\n- Fox Engine. I can't say it's the best engine ever, but I can say this engine can show a very beautiful work especially on settings and landscapes. Every time I begin a mission in Afghanistan I always admire the landscape.\n- Secondary Missions. There's a lot of different mission categories that will keep alive the game for a very long time.\n- Soundtrack. Around the open world you might find here and there some cassette tapes running some 80s songs. You can steal them and listen to them. I simply LOVED THEM ALL, as an 80s lover...\n\n---Cons---Why is it so difficult to rate this game? Because all MGS chapters are games with a deep intricated and very important story. Each chapter is a puzzle itself, which is a part of a WAY greater puzzle and THIS is its strenght. So what happens when there are flaws in almost every pro of the game AND in the story?\n\n- Story. This game feels like it's incomplete. There are 50 story Missions, divided in 2 chapters but actually around 15 of them (all in the second chapter) are some old missions in "Extreme Mode". The second chapter itself has only a fistful of proper missions and it is widely documented there was supposed to be a mission 51 (There's even a DUBBED Gameplay In Youtube) and maybe even a third chapter. And most of the missions are plain and anonymous killings or recoveries. Very disappointing.\n- Direction. After Snake has a long chat with Skull Face on the back of the jeep you just see them doing nothing while you hear the 5/6 minutes of sins of the father while they travel on the jeep... Simply ridicuolous and I'm saying it reluctantly...\n- Cassette Tapes. Most of the story and dialogues are in cassette tapes. Simply disappointing considering the engine and Kojima's directing abilities...\n- Characters. Skull Face is one of the most disappointing villain of the whole saga. I simply can't find him to be credible as a villain, both for the look (that Zorro Mask is TOO RIDICULOUS), and for what he did. At the very beginning he looks so evil, badass, he has an unknown ominous plan. But what happens later is simply ridiculous. On top of that he hasn't any particular ability, he doesn't look worthy of being in charge of Cypher and if you listen carefully to the tapes of the story you understand how he formed his alligiances: Luck. Simply out of luck.\n- Skulls. They're badass as hell I can't help but I was disappointed in seeing nearby soldiers becoming like... Zombies (not really, they're hypnotized, but they act like zombies). It's not a matter of something done bad or working bad, because I believe it fits well both in the context and in the looks. Simply I'm quite bored with Zombies, considering their recent abuse in these latest years (Speaking as a fan of The Walking dead TV Show, or Dead Island Or Dying light).\n\nA conclusion is very difficult. There's more about this game to know because there's a whole context behind it, beside the game itself. Hideo Kojima, the storical creator behind the whole saga has been cowardly put aside and fired by konami. So this kind of makes me think this game's development has obviously been interrupted considering the Rushed look of this game... Anyways I SERIOUSLY Missed playing this kind of game. Maybe because all of this I somehow can see and consider only the brightest sides of the games, I can see the true potential of this chapter and this is why this is the game I've played the most...","January 8","true","180.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

The game is devoid of so much that could have been. MGO is out of beta but barely. This is the worst metal gear solid game created. It's an ok game. To anyone that isn't fresh to the series try mgs3 and then this one. You'll notice this game feels insanely incomplete. This is an unfinished game with a painfully bad story. You can almost feel where in the game Kojima was taken off the project. To repeat its' an OK game with online play that is a shadow of its former self. It's a bad metal gear game. Online play is a pretty far cry from MGO2 though the comparison is unfair due to the fact that MGO2 built up over years and years of online tweaks and additions and MGO3 for PC really started in January 2016. The phantom pain of the other 75% of the game is ever present. They will never finish the single player mode, it will always feel like a pretty good demo. But they already have DLC coming in March for MGO3.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/brutaljones/recommended/287700/","brutaljones","Brutal Jones","http://steamcommunity.com/id/brutaljones/","178 products in account","My negative review of the shameless Konami cash grab that is Ground Zeroes was easily my worst received review ever. But I can happily say that The Phantom Pain is a huge improvement over it, so maybe this one will be more popular.\n\nFor those that tire of my typically long-winded reviews, I'll get this out of the way up front in just a couple of sentences: I would definitely recommend anybody that's a fan of open world or stealth games purchase this. It's a phenomenally fun, addictive experience. BUT! It does have some pretty severe flaws, some returning from Ground Zeroes, and some that have always been present in Kojima's work.\n\nNow, onto the fun part! Ramble time!\n\nThe graphics are really solid, once again. I'm coming off spending about 150 hours in Witcher 3, and though this game doesn't quite compete with that one on a graphical level (nothing does, honestly), it still looks really freaking good. The Fox engine's lighting and particle effects are stunning. And it runs amazingly on PC. I'm holding 60fps solid at 1440p. No complaints here.\n\nThe best part about this game, though, is how addictive the open world progression is. That's something that always seems to draw me in. As a minimap completionist games like this, the Assassin's Creed series, and Witcher 3 are absolutely my bread and butter. I hated how limited Ground Zeroes was. The entire game felt like continuous retreading of common ground. It bored me. This game is a step completely in the opposite direction. The base building, the weapon and equipment progression, the buddy system... It all tickles my fancy. These's so much to do here, and it's hard to put down. It's an experience that will melt away the hours of your day.\n\nI do have some notable criticisms of the game. Some will fall on deaf ears, as Kojima fans love his trademark weirdness, but some are just run-of-the-mill dated Japanese game design issues that I'm seeing more and more frequently these days as the Japanese development scene falls further behind the modern Western scene.\n\nI dove heavily on the dated control scheme in my Ground Zeroes review, so I won't say it all again here. Instead I'll summarize and just say the control scheme is dated and unintuitive. That's an especially bad thing for a stealth game, because you need to be able to react without thinking if you turn a corner and run into a guard. Too many times early in the game I'd have to actually think about what button did what, and a few times I even had to look up the controls to find out what I needed to know: Example: "How the hell do you sprint on horseback? Oh, the X button? WTF? That makes no sense, why the X button when it's L3 to sprint on foot?" You expect the controls to make sense, and if you play as many hours of video games as I do, you can pretty much pick up anything and play it within a few minutes. That's not the case with this and Ground Zeroes, and while it's not a MAJOR issue since the problem is solved by a few hours of getting used to the controls, it's still a pain in the ♥♥♥, and something that the Metal Gear team should have figured out between 2008's Guns of the Patriots and now.\n\nAnother negative is the cover system, which never seems to function as smoothly as I'd like. There's no button press involved so the game judges when you want to be stuck to cover and when you don't, which never seems to work properly in any video game that tries to implement it. Too often I'd get stuck to a wall when needing to move quickly, and too often it would take too long for it to stick me to cover so I could pop off a quick cover shot or target acquisition with the binoculars. This is just another example of dated game design. Cover systems are figured out. There's no reason for Kojima's team to get it wrong here.\n\nBy now most people know Hideo Kojima's style. He's an incredibly quirky guy as a writer and a designer. I typically love his design quirks. They add flavor to the game and keep things interesting. It's why he's great for the industry and why his dismissal from Konami is so disappointing. Even if this game does show some age in the aspects I've mentioned, he still belongs in the pantheon just due to his constant ability to surprise the gamer by implementing completely new, weird things (try playing a certain tape while hiding in a bathroom). He's a boundary-pushing designer. But Kojima as a writer? I know people will hate me for saying this, but I absolutely cannot stand him. Since MGS2 the series has devolved from being a James Bond-esque spy thriller with some weird anime quirks to a nonsensical, incoherent mess. The terribly convoluted story makes little sense. The action sequences are downright cheesy. The characters seem written by a teenager. Full disclosure, though: Campy, kitschy-type stuff has always been completely lost on me. I've never gotten it, never come close to liking it. Perhaps I'm too serious (or boring). It's always made me cringe and instantly turned me off. If you like that sort of thing, then I'm willing to bet Kojima's writing won't be a negative for you.\n\nAnother thing I'd like the mention is the foolish way the game handles the secondary objectives to story missions. They're unknown to begin with, and if you do accidentally trip over one -- such as discovering an item deposit, saving some prisoners, etc -- then they'll become revealed on your objective list and checked off. This isn't bad by itself: It promotes exploration and drives the player to explore the area more thoroughly, which is a necessity in the stealth genre when you often just want to complete your objective and get out quickly in order to maintain your stealth rating and not take a chance of being spotted. The problem I have is that after the you finish the mission, THEN the secondary objectives are revealed. It doesn't make sense for the game to do so. Why now? What changed? Now I'm just magically directed to these other things that I missed? Either keep them unknown until I discover them, or tell me right up front what I need to do. It's a cheap ploy to get you to replay missions multiple times. It feels like the developer is just trying to pad the game's length. It would be a lot more fun to allow me to replay the missions without EVER telling me what the secondary objectives were and simply letting me find them myself.\n\nFinally, I have to mention how awkward Snake/Big Boss is in this game. He just doesn't feel like himself, and it's not because he has a new voice actor, it's because his you hardly ever hear his voice! Seriously, could they just not afford to pay Kiefer Sutherland? He puts forth a great performance when you actually hear him, but he hardly has any dialogue at all! Snake is conspicuously silent during most of the cutscenes, and it's really awkward and offputting. It's completely immersion breaking. It's so noticeable that after a few hours of play I got the distinct feeling that I wasn't even playing the same character I've spent hundreds of hours with in Snake Eater, Portable Ops, and Peace Walker. There must be a bigger story here, because it's obvious that there were some issues with his dialogue when Ocelot and Miller are holding entire conversations with Snake and Snake isn't saying a damn word. Really, really strange. For now my head canon is that Hideo Kojima and Kiefer Sutherland had a falling out when Sutherland discovered Kojima's favorite James Bond was Roger Moore.\n\nAll in all these are pretty minor gripes in the face of a massive, excellent game. I really can't do anything but recommend that anyone with a modicum of interest in the stealth or open world genres take a shot at this game. It's a ton of fun, and even considering its flaws it ends up being a unique gaming experience, which is what Hideo Kojima is rightfully known for.\n\nHere's hoping he finds success in whatever he chooses to do after this. If he keeps making games, I'll gladly keep buying them.","September 5, 2015","true","73.3"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fuckyou1029/recommended/287700/","fuckyou1029","Eddie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fuckyou1029/","151 products in account","People need to stop judging this game based on how much time they sank into the game. I played this game for nearly 50 hours and while I enjoyed it for a while, I realized how much of a chore the game actually is and how there isn't actually as much content as there seems to be. This game is Far Cry with a dumb anime plot (emphasis on the dumb part).\n\nFirst off the open world, while it controls very well and looks very pretty, is very empty and uninspired. The game is set in Afghanistan and Africa, both which are apparently war torn though I never saw any battles between the Soviets or Mujahadeen or between the African PMCs and natives. That's because in each map, you only encounter the Soviets or the African PMCs and nobody else save for the occasional POW. Compare this to a game like S.T.A.L.K.E.R. where there are roughly 5 big factions that roam the world and interact with each other as well as the player, and that game came out 8 years ago. In fact the open world actually detracts from the story by making it feel so disjointed. Maybe if each story mission felt like it had closure like a tv episode (which is what it was supposed to be mimicking I guess), it wouldn't be so bad.\n\nNext the amount of side quests and missions, while there are plenty of each, are all rinse and repeat and the side quests are completely forgettable. This is what they call filler and it's nowhere near as good as the kind they put in twinkies. The story missions themselves mostly consist of assassinating targets and extracting prisoners. But the assassinations almost always turn into extractions as well because the targets are so much better than the usual cannon fodder for your mother base. The actual story missions are usually these kinds of missions as well but instead of being able to fulton out the target, you'll have to carry them to the chopper (what a tweest). What's most disappointing is the lack of boss fights. There are maybe 3 legitimate boss fights in the entire game and they aren't nearly as good as the ones in previous games. Remember fighting Psycho Mantis or The End or The Sorrow? Remember how unique and memorable those boss fights were? You're not going to get anything like that from MGSV.\n\nNow let's talk about the other important part of this game, the story. If you don't want to be spoiled, here's the tl; dr. It sucks and it fails to close the gap between Peace Walker and Metal Gear (MSX). You know, the very thing this game was supposed to do? The reason this plot is dumb is because of some big twists and lazy explanations so if you don't want the story spoiled, look back at my tl; dr. So the biggest problem I have with this game is that (spoiler alert), you're not playing as Big Boss. Venom Snake is actually you, the player who happens to be the medic on the chopper in Ground Zeroes. I get what it's trying to say, anyone can be Big Boss but that plot was already done before in MGS2 and it was much better executed. Here, not only is it dumb in the game's universe, but it makes everything you've accomplished in the game feel like a complete lie. Maybe it's supposed to be our phantom pain (lol) but that's just a horrible idea and it better not be the intention.\n\nAnother annoyance is how Skullface's plan and motivation are dumb and unclear respectively. He comes off as a mustache twirling cartoon rather than an actual interesting villain that all of the trailers made him out to be. But the worst part about him is that (more spoilers) apparently he was helping Big Boss and cleaning up for him since MGS3, making all of Big Boss' accomplishments nullified. If that were the case, then why is Big Boss considered such a legend that they would have to clone him three times? Why would they go through all that trouble when not only can you just brainwash someone else to be able to be like him (Venom Medic), but he didn't even do anything all that special himself? Now MGSV has not only ruined itself, but the entire series. Sure you can go on about how Kojima explains everything with parasites instead of nanomachines now or bringing back certain characters for fanservice and leaving more relevant ones out for no good reason but those pale in comparison to the big dumb twists that this game introduces.\n\nThis game not only disappoints long time Metal Gear fans like myself but also alienates any new fans with it's confusing and lame story. I wouldn't recommend this game to anybody. It turned Metal Gear into a Far Cry clone. Not to knock on Far Cry or anything but Metal Gear used to be it's own unique franchise and it's sad to see it end like this. If you want to play a good Metal Gear Solid game, play one of the first three.","September 12, 2015","false","48.5"," 59 of 107 people (55%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","55","59","107","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/omegaxypher/recommended/287700/","omegaxypher","Dildo Factory Worker #2","http://steamcommunity.com/id/omegaxypher/","265 products in account","This game is like a Rough Diamond, there are gleams of the potential under the unfinished surface but it was just not quite there yet. And this is obvious from its game play to its narrative and even how the story is paced. The further you progress into the game, the more glaring those unpolished flaws drown out the gem underneath it all.\n\nThe gameplay is what draws you in, free roam stealth with a base building mechanic that makes it feel like you are building up to something much bigger than just a super stealth master is addicting. But then you quickly realize that none of the things you are building up towards really goes anywhere.\n\nI never used another weapon other than the M4, and the silenced pistol as my default set up. Anything unsilenced is a waste in this game because stealth is supposed to be everything and there are only a handful of stock suppressed weapons and they are all inferior to what you start with.\n\nThe choice of weapons simply was not interesting enough and its very puzzling how it shows that there are eight grades of weapon upgrades but even though I have not seen a weapon upgrade past grade 6. But this is just one of the first issues that this game has.\n\nI was super exited for the base building mechanic and sending out my soldiers to do missions. But, it is shallow and very uninteresting. But the base building is just a throw away feature and offers nothing towards the overall experience towards the game. Every mission happens off screen, the levels mean nothing but simply make up fake requirements for new weapons until level 40.\n\nAnd the base raiding is just broken, if a player defends, just leave. Because they can keep respawning if you kill them and make it simply not worth your time trying to attack the moment they show up. But really, the rewards for attacking only help with building up a base that simply... offers nothing to the bigger picture of the game.\n\nI was hoping that the FOB raiding would be like some kind of end game content where building up your base actually meant something. But its just tedious and a waste of time, the resources put into this useless mini game could have been put into far more important things... like the story.\n\nBecause the story is a mess, the narrative is easily the most dry and uninteresting thing I have been subjected to. Especially after playing a game like The Witcher that makes this look someone’s overblown fanfiction. And the more I think about it like that... the more I feel like it is the truth. Let’s break down the characters for you!\n\nBig Boss, Dude, I got a massive metal shard in my brain, talking is hard... this is why I don’t say ♥♥♥♥ for 90% of the dialogue.\n\nMiller, growl growl, Phantom Pain, growl growl, revenge.\n\nOcelot, its the bosses choice, But I will ALWAYS contradict Miller, always.\n\nEmmerich, I am just trying to help, everything is everyone else’s fault.\n\nEli, I am the most abrasive child in the world that needs to get the ♥♥♥♥ spanked out of me, why am I not in a cell?\n\nChild Soldiers, Why are we following the white boy around?\n\nSkull Face, My name is stupid, my reason for revenge is stupid, my way of deploying of the parasites is stupid.\n\nCode Talker, THE PARASITES DO EVERYTHING, THEY EVEN TALK TO ME, WHY? BECAUSE NANOMACHINES ARE OVERUSED!\n\nMantis, I am responsible for ♥♥♥♥ing EVERYTHING that happens, but I will only be the first boss for Solid Snake.\n\nMan on Fire, AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!\n\nQuiet, I cannot speak because I am eye candy, even the camera knows this. My ♥♥♥♥ must always be out because apparently I am a ♥♥♥♥ing plant.\n\nD-Dog, I am the most useful companion ever, the tactical advantage I give the player is so damn broken you are stupid to use anyone else.\n\nD-Walker, Boss didn’t even research a single part of me.\n\nD-Horse, who let that ♥♥♥♥ing dog join? I GOT ONE MISSION BEFORE I BECAME USELESS!\n\nBattle Gear, Was I supposed to be important?\n\nSahelanthropus, How the ♥♥♥♥ did I exist before Metal Gear Rex?!\n\nThe characters are all just so dammed boring. Their motivations and goals just serve no interest for me at all, it’s all just noise between the missions. The dialogue is so dammed bad that the bulk of it is shuffled off into cassette tapes for ♥♥♥♥s sakes!\n\n---Spoiler---\n\nAnd that little twist that you get served up at the end? It is just terrible because Venom Snake is fully aware of the fact he is a body double for the real Big Boss, even Miller and Ocelot both know he is a fake.\n\nHideo deliberately withholds this information from the player. Because it serves him better as an opening hook letting the player think he is in control of the real Big Boss. It seems clever, but is nothing more than smoke and mirrors, because his opening act is his strongest hand before everything falls into chaos.\n\nAlso, how ♥♥♥♥ing stupid do you expect us to be? Big Boss looked like ♥♥♥♥ing Big Boss in MGS 4. And don’t try and act like Hideo was being clever by making the opening credits on EVERY ♥♥♥♥ING MISSION as Venom Snake a subtle wink at that there was something amiss. Because was it ♥♥♥♥ing required in the narrative? hell, ♥♥♥♥ing, nope.\n\n---/Spoiler---\n\nYou know what, after finishing this review, it’s not a diamond underneath its unpolished surface... it’s a ♥♥♥♥ing lie wrapped in ♥♥♥♥... 80 ♥♥♥♥ing bucks... could have had myself a steak dinner for that at least I expect that to turn into ♥♥♥♥ when I am done with it and that process only takes 48 hours.","September 19, 2015","false","107.6"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","13","20","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nexttron/recommended/287700/","Nexttron","Nexttron","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nexttron/","592 products in account","TL;DR Addicting stealth gameplay, beautiful PC optimization, with tons of in game content to discover. But be warned, the story and boss fights in this game is by far the worst of the series.\n[ + ] Gameplay Is the bread and butter of this game. You can tell from start to end that this was the main focus of Kojima Productions. Sneaking is now easy to learn, hard to master in an open world full of enemies, animals, vegetation, and buildings. You can run, walk, crouch, and crawl to get through enemy bases / outposts, and if that’s not enough you also get countless weapons, items, and vehicles to help make your mission easier. Add all that up, and you’ll realize you have hundreds of options / ways to complete a mission, making each person’s play through unique based on their playstyle.\n\n[ + ] Graphics are beautiful, and can be seen as another big focus in production besides gameplay. The whole game was developed on the newly made Fox Engine that easily allows for gorgeous lighting, shading, physics, and animations. I would even go as far to say that the facial animations are the best out there right now, something Kojima personally said to have wanted in the game. And the best part is that the game looks great even on lower settings, showing how well the game was optimized.\n\n[ + ] Companions are really fun to have along on missions, and work well within the game. You get up to 4 companions, each one very different in how they can assist you. The dog can track enemies and animals, the horse gives you a quick, easy means of transport, and Quiet can snipe / mark enemies from afar while you sit back and enjoy the carnage. I’ll leave the last companion a secret, but like the rest, it’s very fun to have along and offers unique ways to help you.\n\n[ + ] AI works very well, and you’ll find that enemies adapt to the way you play. In a game like this, it’s crucial to have smart AI, and they really did well because soldiers will react accordingly to what you do to them, or their friends. They think the see something? Most time they’ll walk over to check it out. They come under fire? They’ll call in backup and try to flank you. You start shooting them in the head? Soldiers later on will start to wear helmets. Each post will remember what happened before, making you play different each time.\n\n[ - ] Plot is terrible. The prologue starts off so amazingly, that you’ll find yourself drawn in by everything that’s happening. But after that, it gets continually worse until the games end. The story isn’t told through cut scenes like older entries, rather by NPC’s and cassette tapes as you play in game. There are still cut scenes, and some cool ones at that, but not enough. And the worst thing about the story is…it goes nowhere. Out of the 50 missions, excluding maybe 7 or 8, all you do is collect someone or something, then leave. You go onto the next mission, get data, and find yourself one step closer to the main villain, without ever really feeling like you’ve accomplished anything. And by the time you get to the games ending you’ll feel like something is missing. And there is, because the games 3rd chapter was cut, leaving the game unfinished. If you bought the game expecting a good story or at least a finished one, then you bought the wrong game.\n\n[ - ] Bosses are disappointing. The MGS series have always had the best boss fights, and while Phantom Pain does have a couple cool ones, the rest can’t really be considered a boss fight. The old MGS games had you fight a boss that had his own unique strength, weakness, weapon, and dialogue that made for a real challenge and sort of personal fight. In Phantom Pain you don’t even need skill, or perception to fight bosses. Just shoot them until they die. There’s no build up or dialogue, and don’t have anything special going on, so they come off feeling like a tougher regular enemy.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI truly believe the MGS V we got is different from the one Kojima had originally envisioned. But including the making of the Fox Engine, the game took 5 years of development. After a while I’d say Konami had enough, cut funding, and threw the game out to make money rather than give Kojima more time to make a truly masterful game. Which is why we have cut story content and other features that felt less than completed. With all the news out now its clear Konami has fallen low, and that they are first and foremost a shady business tactician, rather than an inspiring game developer.","December 30, 2015","true","498.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The game runs so smooth on maxed out settings (I have a gtx 960 g1, however due to my 2gb of vram I just have to set like 2 options from ultra to high. Otherwise everything is maxed out and its constant 60fps). The gameplay is just amazing. They put so much work into these small little details and the seriously thought of everything. Compared to all the other metal gear games the gameplay and control of mgsv is overwhelming. And the fob system is actually not as bad as most people think. You actually win more by just playing it a little bit than you would ever lose. I was VERY sceptical at the beginning but even if you lose staff, resources etc. you still gain more than you lose. Simple reason is because when you succeed and you steal stuff, you get bonus rewards too (which is like 10 times more than what you can steal). So even if you invade someone and steal things and he takes revenge and steals them back, both of only profit because of the bonus rewards (and the bonus reward is just given to you by the game, its not stolen from the enemy). And it also adds a lot of extra time to the game.\n\nSo gameplay and everything is amazing and pretty much everyone agrees on that. So whats the thing why some people are dissapointed about the game?\n\nMetal Gear Solid V is not really like the other metal gear games. It heavily focuses on the gameplay and not that much on the story. Long cutscenes are mostly replaced by cassete tapes. Ocelot is not the ♥♥♥♥ anymore he used to be.\n\nCONTAINS VERY SLIGHT SPOILERS NOW... Like really slight spoilers... just dont tell me that I havent warned you.\n\nOn the other hand, the game plays in 1984 and we pretty much know what happened before and what is gonna happen to big boss after that (most of the metal gear games play after 1984 or before). So there really wasnt that much room to add more story and I understand kojima for that. But it also gives a deeper lore to big boss and explains a lot of things like how he became a villain, his and zero's (cipher) relationship and their vision, how he "died" in mg1, the shocking truth about venom snake and eli (liquid snake).\n\nSPOILERS END NOW\n\nSo what people really disliked is that there is no real ending to the game. Mission 46 is the final story mission but its like just a certain part of the game that is replayed but differently but there is no boss or anything. Mission 31 is the end of chatper 1 and it has a boss which is really amazing, but then after chapter 1 the game just feels so rushed.\nThe Kojima and konami conflict was probably the cause of that. Basically: you had to repeat some story missions only on harder difficulty. And seriously, the game is so full of content, but even if they would have removed all the repetitive stuff, the game would have still been ten times longer than any AAA game. They could have also just added like bonus missions where you could just repeat any story mission you want, but on harder difficulty or in subsistence mode.\n\nWhen you play chapter 2 yourself you know what Im talking about. I just wish they would have made an ending which reveals the shocking truth, but also has a boss fight with epic music and lets you walk away like a badass like in mgs3.\nI just which they wouldnt have cut mission 51, that would have been a perfect way to end the game with an eli (liquid snake) boss fight. Would have been cool because he was the main antagonist in other mgs titles too, just as a child now and that would have been really cool.\n\nOh and what about the music? The music in all the mgsv trailers was so amazing, but in the game there is no cool music. Yes, there are cassete tapes, but they dont really fit in that well mostly, and Im talking about the epic music during certain scenes and fights like in others metal gear titles. But in this one there simply wasnt any music :/ Not at least even something like at the end of peace walker XD\n\nConclusion: If you're not an metal gear fan but just like stealth and gameplay GET IT. Its a good game, but not a really story focused metal gear. Adds more stuff to the lore but they were rushing with chapter 2 and mission 51 was completly cut from the game. Until chapter 1: GREAT. Chapter 2: ♥♥♥♥ goes deeper than hell. As I said: they could have just removed that repititive stuff and the game would have still been longer than any AAA game.\n\nMgs3 will always be my favorite Metal Gear.\n\nOne more thing... The main reason things are the way they are in metal gear is because Zero and Big Boss had a vision of a world. But at one point they went parted ways because their visions of a new world were different. Thats how Zero went nuts and Big Boss Started his mercenary business. Sounds familiar? Big Boss = Kojima, Zero = Konami? And just like Zero is greedy for power, Konami is greedy for money.\n\nOuter Kojima Productions Confirmed.\nAnd thanks for reading my way too long review.","December 23, 2015","true","330.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The quality of the new characters is very low, thematically they seem worlds apart from each other and have next to no cutscenes showing you who they are and how they relate to other characters, they are simply tacked on for plot convenience.\nThe new bosses are uninteresting and suffer from not being fleshed out enough, especially the parasite unit looking like soldiers from enemy territory quake wars, the powers they have seem so over the top, why make metal gears and clone the legendary soldier big boss when you can infect hundreds of people and make them into teleporting, super strength and invisble cloaking special forces that would literally wipe out entire units (as you are told about how they beat soldiers without anyone knowing what is going on.)\nThe characters we do know are incredibly underplayed, especially Ocelot who seems to be dull and very serious compared to the over dramatic, sadistic and charasmatic Ocelot we have come to know. Venom snake rarely says anything too, Miller and Huey seem like the only expressive characters and have a great story arch, the game has occasional hidden gem missions and some strong emotive moments but falls flat with all the filler and fluff around it, this game is the fulton extraction simulator, where the game rewards you for simply just chain tranq everyone and extract them, speaking of rewards, the game ranks each mission with S being the best rank, which is obtainable by just beating the level very fast, there is youtube videos of people literally avoiding fighting and stealth and running to the objectives.\nA lot of the features of the game are missing, such as using battle gear and the illusive chapter 3. The mother base is a ghost town, huge with nothing in it, without target practise there is no reason for you to be on the base at all, considering its size its a joke that it exists, there was so much potential and it was wasted.\nThe game holds the strongest game play mechanics and the best stealth gameplay compared to the other games of the series, but falls short in all other aspects, with bad design choices, such as  mandatory helicopter scenes/deployment, huge amounts of filler, grinding and constant menus with the idroid taking huge portions of time to navigate and deploy things, overuse of Fulton extraction,  repeating objectives and mission types, short cut scenes with very little emotive facial expressions considering how much facial recognition technology was used.\nI found it strange that credits were played during the beginning of every main mission telling you who is starring in that level and constant reminder of who had helped direct the game, Hideo Kojima, like I would forget?\nI just feel disappointed by the obvious missing content and boring repetitive nature of the game, its hastily put together and lacks the quality that all the other metal gear games delivered, a huge shame for a brilliant series of games.","September 22, 2015","false","174.1"," 29 of 51 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","29","51","0","0"

Yes, Quiet's excuse for her gratuitious skin show is stupid. Yes, Konami wants to cram in as many microtransactions as humanly possible. Yes, it's annoying that Venom Snake is almost a silent protagonist. Yes, the cutscenes are extremely short and there aren't as many as in previous games. Yes, this game is open world and it might feel like it's padded. Yes, most people may not like the tapes as a replacement for long Codec conversations.\n\nBut you know what?, for all it's faults, it's my personal GOTY 2015 runner up (slightly behind The Witcher 3), because I haven't had this much fun with a videogame in a long, long time, it's easily the absolute best action/stealth game I've ever played in my entire life and I'd still whole heartedly recommend it, just keep in check your expectations and everything will go smoothly.\n\nGet it, it's ♥♥♥♥ing awesome :)\n\nA little 2016 update.\n\nThis game now officially has a multiplayer mode called Metal Gear Online. It's a nice distraction from the main game and it can get pretty fun at times, but don't buy this just for the multiplayer alone, heck, don't even buy ANY of the microtransactions it brings with it.\n\nI still recommend this game without hesitation, but just don't get it for the multiplayer alone.","March 23","true","34.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

While it is rather unique and open world unlike the other MGS games, it still has kept most of the mechanics from previous games and adds a LOT more to the table. Building up your own Mother Base takes time and requires a huge amount of resources and money, but will allow you to upgrade your gear and research new equipment for you on your missions. Use Fulton Balloons to extract targets, kidnap enemy troops or steal equipment and vehicles from the enemy, or just to cause chaos.\n\nGame runs smooth on my 970 on the max settings at 60ish FPS so seems quite optimized.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheSavageBatman/recommended/287700/","TheSavageBatman","Raiden (Away for 3 weeks)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheSavageBatman/","114 products in account",""Kept you waiting, huh?"\nThis review is coming from someone who has never played a Metal Gear game before.\n\nThe Review\n\nMetal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is a Hideo Kojima game, and is the concluding game to the Metal Gear Solid series. Usually, I don't rate my games with numbers because I feel like too much influence will affect the consumer, but Metal Gear Solid V gave me three things I could easily give a 10/10: Gameplay, Sound, and the Technical side.\n\nThe gameplay in this game is incredible. It let's you be creative, and it's very polished. This is some of the best weapon customization I've used. It details to almost every part of your weapon. There's also alot of outfits to customize Snake with, and so many tools to use like decoys, grenades, sleeping mines, a cardboard box, and a balloon to shoot people through the sky with! Hell, if you get far enough into the game, you can tell your horse to drop a number 2 on the road to wreck vehicles. There's so many different styles of gameplay that are possible to do, with 4 buddies all with unique abilities that can help you out in the field. Stealth feels a little too easy sometimes though, but the artificial intelligence of the soldiers are really smart. Even away from the field, there's an indepth system for you to recruit people into your military, and you can build a zoo! Also, this time Metal Gear Solid comes with an open world, which I like to consider more of an "open sandbox setup for you to complete your missions". It doesn't look the prettiest, but there are alot of places for you to visit that are interesting.\n\nThe story in this game isn't the best, but I've got some good things to say about it. It's a creative goodbye to the fans from Kojima that is very well done. The cutscenes are also very well made, with great camera angles and style, although I wish they were longer, and there were more of them. It's not a deep story, but unlocking that secret ending will mess with your head. The beginning starts out interesting, but you'll have to know more of the Metal Gear lore to fully understand everything that is going on. The problem with this game's story, is theres not enough meat. Story missions feel straight up like missions, and they'll have you repeating the same objectives: Extract this person, Blow up these tanks, Find this intel, etc. There are some good missions though, with some more fantastic cutscenes that were way too short. The game is broken up into 2 chapters, but in my opinion chapter 1 is much better than chapter 2, but chapter 2 had some important moments, so it's still worth playing. There was supposed to be a chapter 3, but it was cut from the final game. There's still an ending, but it'll make you look up online to check if there is another mission simply because there's so many loose ends never tied.\n\nGraphics are fantastic for the most part, but there are some rock textures that feel too low resolution for a next-gen game, and long-distance textures take too long to load sometimes. Sound design is friggin' incredible. I really did feel like I was in the Metal Gear universe sneaking around, so they've definetly nailed the atmosphere. It is also extremely well optimized. I ran at a buttery smooth 60fps, and never crashed once or froze. Even though my framerate never went above 60, it never went below, and I mean NEVER.\n\nOverall Opinion\n\nMetal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, is a fantastic game. The gameplay lets you tackle the objective any way you want with so many different possibilites, and the sound and graphics really help immerse you into the world and gameplay. Plus, it's very well optimized. The story in my opinion isn't bad, but it'll be a hit or miss with alot of people. I didn't include this in the review, but the Multiplayer is a blast to play.\n\nFinal Recommendation\n\nIf you're looking for a game that your gonna have alot of fun with, and also some pretty fun multiplayer modes, this game is worth the full 60 dollars in my opinion. If you're only looking to play multiplayer, wait until the price drops, or pick it up on a site that sells cheap Steam games. No $60 game is worth buying just for multiplayer in my opinion. If you're looking to play a deep story, even though I said it's a "hit or miss story", I wouldn't risk it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/itswar11/recommended/287700/","itswar11","itswar11 ジ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/itswar11/","660 products in account","Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is Hideo Kojima's final Metal Gear Solid game, which finally bridges the gap between Peace Walker and Metal Gear from 1987, showing the legendary "Big Boss" fall from hero status, and descend into the realms of Hell, and becoming the villain of the series.\n\nExcept  that doesn't happen.\n\nMGSV takes the series in a bold new direction; switching from a linear corridor structure into an open world environment. This was a big risk for the series, but has paid off greatly. Of course however, this means that MGSV has some issues related to this change. For example the open world; while large, feel really boring and empty, despite the large amount of wildlife and enemies.\nThe AI is pretty stupid at times too, having a short sight and getting stuck in geometry. Other times however the AI are cheating, being able to see through buildings, mountains and other forms of geometry. Lastly the open world loves to waste your time, waiting for your helicopter to drop you off or arrive, slowly making yourself across the open world is tiresome.\n\nDespite this however; MGSV features the best gameplay of the series so far, and features more options than ever to tackle almost every mission. Despite having large amounts of options however; such as being able to use explosives to distract enemies, or even using sound as a distraction, the best solution is usually using your tranquilizer pistol and extracting the soldier. There are many ways to do your objective yes, but there is usually only one really efficient way of doing this. Sure enemies get progressively smarter as you do this tactic by wearing helmets or armor, but this proves to just be a minor inconvenience.\nThe gunplay is fantastic, the guns feel like they have weight, you can feel the impact of your bullets, and the aiming is very fluid. However MGSV also has the MGS4 problem, where there are a lot of guns - both lethal and non-lethal - but you'll only use one or two of lethal or non-lethal weapons.\n\nWeapon customization is pretty barebones however, the changes are usually only cosmetic, and the only reason I would use the customization was to place a silencer on my weapons, making the whole system very shallow.\n\nMother-base management also returns from Peace Walker, allowing you to grow your base of operations into a force to be reckoned with. You progress Mother-base through extracting soldiers with skills and setting them into their most efficient sector of Mother-base. As you extract more staff for Mother-base, development for weapons, items, tools, and abilities increase. The interface is very smooth and easy to manage.\n\nBecause of this however, this means that grinding is required in order to access high tier gear. You may also encounter frequent roadblocks due to the lack of tools to complete specific goals.\n\nMissions consist of Main missions and Side ops. Main missions are obviously what progress the story, most objectives usually require "Extract the target" or " blow up the target" which can get tiring really fast if you don't experiment. At the end of each main mission you are ranked from E to S, based on how many times you've been spotted, your accuracy, hits taken, time, etc. Most of the main missions support both play styles, and it is entirely possible to get an S rank if you go the non-stealthy way of completing the mission. Main missions also have mission tasks. Throughout the mission you can compete tasks, ranging from "Extract the prisoner" to "Listen to the conversation between X and Y". Some of these are enjoyable, some of them however are downright terrible. Due to the somewhat buggy nature, the conversation of the targets may not even trigger, requiring a restart. This can be incredibly frustrating if you're a completionist, and proves that the designers didn't have any other tasks the player could do in the mission. Despite this however, the main missions are generally a enjoyable experience.\n\nSide ops are a mixed bag however.\n\nThere are 157 Side ops in the game, but most of them are largely the same, almost the same as the main ops, consisting of "Eliminate the tank unit" or "Extract the highly skilled soldier" which can get incredibly boring after the first 50 or 100 side ops. You aren't ranked in these ops, so you're free to mess around as much as you want. Compared to 2010's Peace Walker, the side ops lack any imagination or fun aspects, which is very disappointing.\nLastly, the game suffers from a lack of boss fights.\nBoss Fights are a staple in the MGS series, which is why it is very disappointing to see a lack of boss fights. There is a boss fight against  Metal Gear Sahelanthropus, a Metal Gear Which can stand upright  but is very shallow and mostly acts as bullet sponge.\n\nSince I've talked about the gameplay long enough, I think it's time to talk about the storyline of MGSV.\n\nSpoilers ahead\nUltimately, MGSV's storyline is lacking, and by the end of the game it is outright terrible.\n\nWhat we have is a literally unfinished storyline, character arcs which go no-where, and major plot holes within the story.\n\nEvery character is devoid of life, and lacks the charm of the Metal Gear franchise. Snake barely talks, and is ultimately forgettable despite Kiefer Sutherland's excellent efforts.\nHuey is turned from a goofy, likeable character in Peace Walker, to an evil, selfish, piece of ♥♥♥♥, that makes him more evil than Skullface, ruining any character he had.\n\nSkullface's plan can literally be beaten with pen and paper, and his back-story lacks any substance or reasoning. Skull face doesn't even include a  Boss Fight .\n\nThe "Taboos" that Kojima promised were merely tame, and lack any impact or creativity. Big Boss never becomes a villain in this game because *MAJOR GAME BREAKING SPOILER *  Big Boss turns out to be the Medic from Ground Zeroes who is made to look like Big Boss in order for the real Big Boss to be a coward and hide from CIPHER.  The twist was ultimately horrible, and feels like it was made to be shocking rather than clever. This resulted in ret-cons, and  Big Boss ultimately being a coward, and giving Kojima an easy way to explain why the real Big Boss survived Solid Snake's attack\n\nThe twist is incredibly obvious as well, with too many hits alluding to this twist, which is poor writing, as its too obvious.\n\nLastly are the plot holes infesting MGSV. Here are a few:\nEli steals Metal Gear Sahelanthropus but is never followed up.\nCode Talker warns Snake of Miller which goes no-where.\nSnake becoming a Villain never happens.\nAs a game, Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is mostly excellent, it provides players with deep, complex gameplay, with many options to tackle objectives in the most efficient way possible. As a way to end the series however, the game is absolutely atrocious. It truly saddens me that this is it, Kojima will never make another Metal Gear Solid game, due to his parting with Konami.\n\nMGSV may be my current Game of the Year, but it is also my most disappointing Game of the Year.","September 18, 2015","true","90.3"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

Also the weapon and mech design is really amazing, i like how the team made this by mixing firearms design, its even cooler than real life firearms.)\nStory 7.4/10 (Well to be honest after 370 hours (60 hours offline), i was happy with the first chapter, but unfortunately i feel betrayed by the second chapter the reason being... just try it since i don't want to spoil anyone. About the ending, well i think i'm pretty much satisfied with the ending, but i don't know why was the Episode 51 only included in collectors disc, at least they should gave a Steam video for us PC user.)\n\nThis is really great game. Have been following this series since Metal Gear Solid, released for PSOne in 1997. This feels like my dream came true since i've always imagine "What if MGS have open-world element? i mean i'd like to infiltrate a base with my own way.", and It was really shocking to me when i hear it the first time in 2013, almost crying if i have to be dramatic. This game is really good, not only for old time fan, but also to newcomer who like stealth-action genre, even casual gamer would like this (probably, some of my friend does.). Also, the way this game optimized is just amazing. My laptop with AMD Radeon HD 6750M, Intel i5-2430M, and 4 GB RAM can run this game pretty well with Medium settings, this is one of the best game that released in 2015 after all, live up to my expectation. As a closing i'd like to give my appreciation and thanks to Hideo Kojima and Kojima Production for releasing the game for PC, because it's also one of my dream since you all stopped porting the game to PC after MGS 2. Hope you guys continue to create games that people like, create another amazing series that will beat even Metal Gear series itself.","September 14, 2015","true","946.8"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","11","17","2","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/marcelus7/recommended/287700/","marcelus7","Marcelus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/marcelus7/","247 products in account","Pros:\n- One of the best stealth games out there.\n- Replaying missions is most of the times a different experience. If the games is boring or repetitive is because you don't use all the tools you have.\n- Environments looks great. The weather system and day / night cycles changes the way you approach a base. The terrain has good use of vertical design. The FOX Engine works great on all next-gen platforms. I played the PS4 and this PC versions. Between both versions more than 200 hs. Still playing both for whiiiiiiiiiiiiilee!\n- The main advantage of this PC version is the lighting. Some shaders respond better to specular maps. The texture work between PS4 and PC at least looks kind of the same range. There're some critical closeups to textures like some Diamond Dogs logos and Quiet sniper riffle that looks awful on both. But aside that the game looks outstanding and runs great even on "Borderless Fullscreen" mode ;) It had some stuttering issues and problems with alpha maps of particles during day one but they are solved.\n- The game adapts to your gameplay style. It changes the experience every time you replay a mission.\n- Master Miller rules!\n- If you liked MGS Peace Walker this is a great evolution.\n- The buddies of course! D.D. Is Love! <3 Sometimes you'll think a buddy is OP but they have a few weakness for different play styles. For instance Quiet needs to be upgraded to have better "penetration" on soldiers armor. And as I mentioned above, the AI changes because of your play-style and the buddy you choose.\n- This last one is for the nostalgic ones....did you play Commandos series? or even Syphon Filter 2 / 3? Well you'll find some good missions here ;) (not to mention Splinter Cell fans and Far Cry lovers who also are OK with third person games)...Many mechanics are from those games.\n\nCons:\n- Without spoilers....The game is flawless....but I will say...don't play it for the story, characters or even expecting boss fights. If you're not an MGS fan this will not be a problem. If you're you're don't expect much.\n- I didn't play MGO (Metal Gear Online) but this Steam version will make you wait until 2016.\n- There's no Co-Op if you're a Peace Walker fan. But it maybe would broke the game and the content regarding gameplay is vast so I don't think it's fair to take this last item seriously.\n\n***SPOILER SECTION***\nTake in mind that all this doesn't mean that the game don't worth buying or playing it. This are only comments for fanboys.\n\nSTORY:\n- In previous MGS we had the Codec or the Radio on MGS3 SE. Now those conversations occurs mainly on the Cassette Tapes. They embrace those tapes a lot. There're good ones but...Even MGS Peace Walker had more drama. We miss that feedback during gameplay with interesting conversations. In MGSV they are mainly generic (when you press L1 / LB).\n- The rumors of cuted content aside that Mission 51 "Kingdom of Fireflies" on the Collectors Edition of the game. Is rumored that the game had Chapter 3 "Peace" and even two more chapters.\n- Anyways the ending would have been "Truth: The Man Who Sold the World". Which brings me to the ending. I'm not mad because Venom Snake is not Big Boss. It was so cheap and obvious to put that in the end of the game that the twist was not enjoyable as it could have been even at the beginning. The main problem with the ending is the repeated Prologue mission without being really clever or changing really the way you end up in that situation.\n- Even a DLC wouldn't solve the game that you don't feel achieving nothing in the story.\n- The Chapter 1 feels OK, but I felt at that moment I was only at the 10% of what fans expected in terms of story progression. Then you have the infamous Chapter 2 "Race".\n- The "Revenge" side of the plot was very soft and less dark than they promised. There even a few cuted  cutscenes that shows us Venom Snake walking in the aftermath of an airstrike (we suppose). That's opened to interpretation but we expected him to evolve. Even if not much people like "SW Ep III The Revenge of the Sith" I heard many butt-hurt fans, like me haha!, waiting for something like that or something more like a Walter White differences aside....Not to mention the Hearts of Darkness feel of "Apocalypse Now"...Oh man!\n- There a few little plot holes like the Quiet language one. They could have been way better developed. Her appearance on Cyprus could have had flashbacks or a major twist.\n- There's no old characters fan service. I mean this is not MGS4 is OK. But we could have achieved the famous "Missing Link" Quote with some Frank Jaeger moments, him saving Naomi and meeting this Venom Snake telling us that Portable Ops was or wasn't canon. Sniper Wolf meeting him...or maybe other MGS characters that meets the timeline.\n- I accept the story as it is now. But one of my major  was not to bring a character not included on the trailers, at least ONE, like Para Medic and her or him to represent Cipher's will during Zero's coma. We all knew about the patriots. It could have been way darker. Even including a final last environment maybe on a snowy place to  take advantage of the FOX Engine...that was just a silly desire (but Cipher was nothing but a few tapes....good ones but depressing).\n- Talking about depressing Silent Hillish moments...the final cutscene from the Paz side-quest. Not only this but most of the game felt meaning less after revealing the supposedly twist at the end. Meeting with Eli could have been interesting if we knew...I'm for sure 100% not your father or even trying to analyse what's on Ocelot's and Kaz minds and what they hide or expect of this situation.\n- Miller was OK!\n- Ocelot is an amazing character. He always had good twists. We knew how Kaz would end during Shadow Moses on his apartment dead at his hands...and that last conversation was nice but...We expected Ocelot to has his "Ocelot Moment" even against YOU.\n- OK...and lastly...talking about Venom. David Hayer thing aside. Kiefer has a nice voice it fits...but they could have done something similar with less budget to give Venom personality and development. Even Raiden rejects his dog tag ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on the 4th wall. This is a cliche nowadays. All people talks about that and yes...is justified. But nothings sucks more than play as yourself in a franchise with 28 years and strong main characters. Oh...that that hipnotherapy for the medic was cheap...then "Les Efants Terribles" would mean anything against a Medic's Army haha!\n\nBOSS FIGHTS:\nR.I.P. FOX HOUND, Dead Cell, B&B, Cobra Unity, GRU etc...\nOne of the crucial flaws for MGS fans was the lack of iconic Boss Fights. Yes, they din't hinted this they said clearly before release that "they're not traditional boss fights". Some of the encounters at the Honey Bee mission, and Elis fight were cool. That last one with his resemblances to MGS if you confront him. I loved the "Lady SKULLS"...yes I love the Universal Soldier G.I.Joe Sci-Fi thing xD\n\n- Sahelantropus was easy as hell...beautiful but easy...\n- The SKULLS were mainly the same thing.\n- What about the squads like Rogue Coyote or XOF...they needed big personalities or weapons like bombs, and tactis involved with story twists inside.\n- The Man On Fire needed a life or death last encounter not a depressing one as the mission your recover his body.\n- Tretij Rebenok (Little Mantis as we call but we don't know) deserved a twisted boss fight. Maybe including kids possed on different environments...\n- Quiet was a nice pseudo-boss stage but it didn't have any antipation...or hint before.\n\nThere were so many possibilities for bosses not shown on trailers related to Skull Face, Cipher or even a different third force.\n\nNot much more to say. I loved the game, some great moments as Mission 43 for sure.\nBut this makes us learn to not be fanboys. This ends this era of old franchises.\nGoodbye Castlevania, Silent Hill and now MGS. We'll always have the old ones for the nostalgia ;)","October 1, 2015","true","127.2"," 14 of 23 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","14","23","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KiryaX/recommended/287700/","KiryaX","KiryaX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KiryaX/","533 products in account","(NOTE: I will talk a lot about gameplay features and presentation. There will be talk about the story but there won't be any actual story/plot spoilers)\n\n\n\nIs this the best stealth action game of all time? Is such a thing possible? Yes it is!\n\n\n-BUDDY SYSTEM- This was my favorite part of the game so I will talk about it first. You can take animals, robots or an overly attached sniper along for the ride with you. The entire feature is probably the best AI buddy thing any game has ever done. I can't even think of a linear game that does what MGSV does when it comes to having a friendly npc with you let alone an open world game. The entire experience was kind of surreal and mind blowing. The game is so ahead of its time.\n\n-AUDIO PRODUCTION- Amazing just like every MGS game in the past. The music, sounds and effects are all sublime. The intro song to the game is very good too. The dialouge is very engaging and well written just like all MGS games in the past. Lots of humor. Lots of nonsense.\n\n-GAMEPLAY- Have you ever wanted to play a game whose developers are a bunch of talented overachievers? Yea this game is for you. Being able to infiltrate enemy outposts from any direction in an open world is an amazing thing. An open world where you roll on the ground while interrogating enemies and use dozens of fun gadgets to help you clear out enemies. There is nothing like it. The running, animations and controls are so well refined its rare to see so much depth in a video game. All of this paired with the buddy system created so much fun. The real great thing about this game is your helicopter. The entire game was designed around it. You will actually be rescuing people.  You actually have to call extraction and carry your objective to the chopper. All of this happens under stealth world rules. Its really unique and methodical. Unlike most games out there that trigger a cutscene. This game will actually make you play out all the scenarios. Now of course you don't have to play stealthy if you don't want but it really is rewarding if you do. There are many options and so many different combinations for infiltration.\n\n-MOTHERBASE- Some people probably didn't like this but I thought it was an excellent minigame within the bigger game itself. Managing motherbase and gathering high ranked soldiers was actually a very fun simulator. There was a lot of micromanagement and maintenance but its great. Its like metal gear manager :D\n\n- FOB - This is a very controversial feature in the game but I felt it was a very innovative feature. You build a base and have to defend it from other people who might invade it. You can also invade other peoples bases and steal their resources, soldiers etc. This is very divisive among the community because you can be invaded while you are offline. As a result many people are terrified but at the end of the day its not a big deal because its not that hard to obtain money and resources in the game. Its actually very easy. Anways if you are into risky multiplayer feature you will like this. I spent a good 100 hours invading and actively defending. I had a blast and many close calls. The stealth gameplay and all your singleplayer tools are very well implemented into the feature. This section of the game is like VR Missions + Steroids + Dark Souls PVP + Kojima + lots of fun. You can easily lose hundreds of hours doing FOB stuff. This feature also introduces optional microtransactions but its not necessary in any way. The microtransactions don't really do much other than speed up the development time of items. But it doesn't matter because you will still be grinding resources to start the development. Whether you spend money on microtransactions or not you will grind a lot in this game. A lot.\n\n- FOX ENGINE- The game is really well optimized and the gameplay is perfectly refined. The industry can learn a lot from this game. This is what happens when you leave a project in the oven for so long. It plays so well and you can tell Kojima productions poured their soul into this. Its really special. I played for over 100 hours and never had any crashes. The framerate was always smooth with the exception of like one cutscene. No bugs at all tho some reported a save bug which was quickly patched by the dev team.\n\nBOSS FIGHTS - There were very few fights in this game compared to other MGS. The few fights that are here are very good tho. Its a completely different experience this time around so its really hard to judge. The game is open world and you don't have a life bar in the top corner telling you how much health you have. You don't have some magical rations to equip and use. The health is regenerating as a result you can die wthin seconds of taking damage. Some things like explosions will kill you in one shot. Overall I would say MGS3 and MGS1 had the best boss fights. MGSV is definitely better than MGS2 and MGS4 tho.\n\n-STORY- Kojima probably got real tired of people making fun of MGS4 for having like 10 hours of cutscenes and only 5 hours of gameplay. This time around its very different. You are looking at a stealth action game with over 100 hours of gameplay and only like 5 hours of cutscenes. Its so different compared to all the previous games it kind of split the community. The presentation and pacing is very different this time around. You don't really see a bunch of silly over the top anime characters like you did in MGS4. Instead the story is much darker and you won't find as much cringe in it. The long pointless briefing cutscenes from MGS4 are not in this. Instead you get a lot of tapes briefing you with lots of information. You can listen to these tapes whenever you want. Some tapes are very good and contain a lot of important information. Some I wished Kojima made cutscenes but for what ever reason he didn't. Either way its absolutely critical for you to listen to these tapes. Not listenting to tapes in this game is equivalent to skippin cutscenes in previous MGS games.  Some tapes are kind of long so make yourself some food and eat while listenting.\n\nThe only real flaw with the story and this game is that the ending was rushed. The ending itself was great but everything leading up to it was just not there. Its missing like a good 5-6 missions. The ending also raises a lot of questions about this long near 30 year story but unfortunately Kojima has left Konami and sadly we will never get any of those answers. Previous MGS games always had future titles to continue elaborating on the story but this time around we probably won't get that type of treatment. It is what it is.\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION-  Kojima pushed the stealth genre like 15 years into the future with this game. Its a must play and best game of the year without doubt. Take every stealth game released in recent years and all of them combined aren't even 1% of what MGSV is. That is the cold truth.\n\n28 years of excellence from Hideo Kojima.

It's pretty fun and sometimes rewarding. Even though the AI can go crazy, and enemies can only see up to 50-55 meters then go blind.  A lot of useless weapons and items. Seriously, you're just gonna use the same rifle, tranq sniper rifle and tranq pistol for singleplayer, and the same shotgun and rocket launcher for fob. Weapons feel all the same. It's a joke looking back at peace walker. And resources grinding it's like one of the worst thing that could have happened to this game.\n\nBOSS BATTLES: are a ♥♥♥♥ing joke. Just one mecha, same 4 mini bosses for 4 times, and a sniper. A ♥♥♥♥ing sniper. What the ♥♥♥♥ happened to metal gear?\n\nSTORY WISE: nothing. There's no story, as simple as that. The only thing this game explains is why Big Boss dies in metal  gear 1. Just that. This game could have explained so much, could have told so much. But kojima was too busy ♥♥♥♥ing raiden's ♥♥♥ i guess. There are like 3 or 4 good missions though. Some in africa, some back at the mother base.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this game to a MGS fan. I just had to cry after mission 46, knowing that was it. The last, amazing final chapter of Metal Gear is an empty shell of good gameplay and fanservice.\nI would recommend this to newcomers in metal gear. Play this, then play the older games and realize how much of a ♥♥♥♥ this one is.\n","September 17, 2015","false","326.1"," 57 of 106 people (54%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","54","57","106","6","22"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KazumaKat/recommended/287700/","KazumaKat","KaZumaTree","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KazumaKat/","433 products in account","GET IT!\nTL;DR = Easily a contender for Game Of The Year 2015. Hideo Kojima has done it again, marred only by questionable corporate decisions by Konami. If you have room for one game for the next year (or two), get this!\n\n+ Shockingly well optimized, and will likely be the benchmark for performance in games to come. 1080p/60FPS, buttery smooth, and when it isnt, its so well done that smart use of adaptive motion blur as well as dynamic focus scaling makes it so that the action's not interrupted even in the most heated of moments. And even on the most ancient of potatos, it'll either just straight-up not run (at this point, you have got to be on some silly Pentium 4 or similar, older than my nephew) for obvious reasons, or it'll tone things down to where it tries to maintain a constant FPS at the start. Options for a 30FPS lock as well.\n\n+ A masterpiece of Kojima storytelling, even for non-fans of Metal Gear. Even if this is your first MGS game, you wont feel lost, nor will you ever feel left out. MGS fans will appreciate this as much as newcomers, and maybe even convert them over.\n\n+ A perfectly blended mix of 3P shooting action mechanics, tactical sneaking that the series is known for, open-world freedom and exploration (and resource exploitation), taking care of your own base with its little Pokemon-like gotta-catch-em-all soldier capturing mechanic. You can even go ahead of a planned mission to do recon, plan routes, and even infiltrate and take out vital base resources like the power generator, comms, and air radar and they'll remain down when you have a mission in the same area! (Spoiler: You get a storyline mission that you can IMMEDIATELY complete even before you land if certain events in the mission zone are already handled...)\n\n+ Already EASILY 40 hours worth of content IN CHAPTER 1 ALONE! And that's just rushing things! This game may be a 70-100hr monster, and you wont want to rush it, thats for sure!\n\n~~~~~\n\n- 60FPS top lock (seen as Auto in settings). Arguements can be said that there are technical, design, and performance reasons for such a lock, but it is there, and can be seen by some noticeable pop-in in larger areas.\n\n- Kojima storytelling, complete with lengthy cutscenes that have a bit too much fat on them and go for a bit too long. If you disliked MGS because of how long such cutscenes are, apologies, but this game carries that same banner.\n\n- As much as the mechanics are all very well blended together, they are still a blend of mechanics that have issues when brought together into on game without proper UI support. Chief among which is the control problems when handling large menus and lists in your iDroid (easily seen when managing Mother Base staff). This is exacerbated by the lack of mouse support in menus at all. Another problem is the required precision of one's fingers no matter the control method when handling something like CQC. You can end up grabbing your opponent when you intended to disarm and hold up instead, or end up throwing a 5-hit combo when you wanted to throw. Also there is a lack of feedback when bases and outposts you have gone through have "restocked", repairing the damage you have put it through, which can be a bit of a surprise when going through a base you've sabotaged completely only to discover they have power again.\n\n- Game requires a long-term investiture of time and effort to complete, even when rushing through things. The game also has a sizable portion of its significant, plot-important content hidden behind some Side Ops, hidden areas on your base that you may not even visit, and such.\n\n- The story is almost too large and encompassing, and due to the fallout between Hideo Kojima and Konami, that critical storyline plot points in the end were not completed in time, and judging from the deluxe boxed versions of the game (which had an extra CD containing extra videos of cut cutscenes) that there are arguements that the game is actually incomplete.\n\n- Controversial multiplayer FOB microtransaction execution, as well as shoddy server power to handle launch week. Whilst one can indeed earn the microtransaction-obtained MB Coins via the Daily Login Award, the amounts are questionably low as well as getting it is difficult as it is due to the servers being spotty at the best of times, two weeks from launch.\n\n- Forced multiplayer FOB. It seems that the multiplayer portion of this game is forced upon no no matter the player's discretion, which can be seen as a detriment to solo-play enthusiasts. On top of this, multiplayer FOB "raiding" mechanics are obfuscated and confusing to newcomers, which does not help dissuade the percieved difficulty cliff and skill gap between those who actively play FOB multiplayer, and those who are just trying to play the singleplayer portion of the game without losing men or resources. FOB's past the first one given to you by the game are also exorbitantly expensive, which in itself is bad enough given microtransactions in a full-price game.","September 6, 2015","true","312.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

So this is the first time ive got actually something bad to say about any metal gear solid...\n\n\nYou see, i consider myself an MGS fanboy. I think the saga is the best videogame saga that has ever been created and i think MGS1 is the best game in all mankind. That being said, i finished the game after playing for over 100 hours in one entire week (didn't even play another game) and i am at 57% completition.\n\nThat being said, the game has its flaws\n\n\nFlaws, simple flaws like an awful checkpoint system, frustrating people when even if you die while calling for the exfil chopper, the checkpoint takes you back to the start of the mission, or having most of the 2nd chapter missions be just the same as the first chapter but in higher difficulty or with their own challenge tweaks.\n\nWhat its NOT a simple flaw its the way the story is paced. After 30 missions, people finish the chapter one with a very badass cutscene, and then proceed at snail pace through the (less than 10) story missions of the 2nd chapter to finish the game. See the problem here? 30 unique missions in chapter 1, and 20 in chapter 2, wich over half of them are just the same as their chapter one counterparts except with "slower health regeneration, no chicken hat, no reflex mode" or "mission fails when you get detected". Still, with a gameplay THIS solid, having just a few problems (problems like the cover system, or the quite unperfect hitboxes), i didn't mind going through these missions again, just for the sake of the fun of it. Of course, at one point i was able to unlock the last few missions, wich incluided the quiet's ending (wich, honestly, made me tear a little bit) with the side effect of the permanent removal of quiet as a buddy (♥♥♥♥ing you when you used her a lot or when you spent a lot of GMP in her upgrades) and being unable to ever recover her again, for the sake of storytelling and lore i was able to say "ok, that ♥♥♥♥ happened, but i can still enjoy the game".\n\n\nThen i played the lastest story mission (not the lastest listed mission, wich is just the Sahelantropus fight in harder difficulty).\n\nI was trying to tell myself that i could still enjoy the game after that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ slap-in-the-face ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t cliffhanger ending, wich didn't explained anything, left A LOT of questions. I wouldn't mind that last part, if not... because... you know, this is the LAST MGS game kojima will direct? Yeah, big problem leaving the last game that will ever be made end in a cliffhanger, and its not like the last level was any fun, it was the same thing as just the prologue, just from a different perspective, and then they try to flush down answers through tapes that you acquired after finishing the game.\n\nThe game goes slowly telling you what's going on, some main ops being about the story, some others being more realistic stuff snake would do if he got the job, and the game is packed with very heavy moments that dont force players to feel, but its very likely that they do. All the more annoying when the game suddenly ends like that and no more is revealed. You dont even get to use the Triumph Boneville shown at the last cutscene of the last mission, wich is a missed opportunity since you get the clothes "snake" has during that cutscene.\n\n\nSo basically, after playing so much of the game, the end takes one of the most useful buddies away (out of the 4 there are in total, wich were all spoiled in the trailers and gameplay teasers), tells you to go ♥♥♥♥ yourself, and now i hear rumors that konami forced kojipro to relase the game in this state, making the rest of the chapters updates (or, since this is konami we are talking about, 10-20 USD DLC after the full 60 USD game purchase) that will come later. Of course, i WILL change this review if the next upcoming story chapters will answer even more questions (and being able to re-acquire quiet would be nice too).\n\n\n\nBut then again...... This is konami we are talking about, so i dont keep my hopes up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEDIT: Well, after playing some more, boring my skull out with the overly repetitive side ops, getting sucefully invaded, failed invasion, succefull invasion, sucefull invasion, suceful invasion, failed invasion, suceful invasion, most of my staff gone, half my resources stolen without me being able to do anything, i found out just how dead the world of MGS V is...... dead.\n\n\nNo action you do affects the game, at best you break an anti air radar allowing you to pick more LZs. Radio terminals that you break respawn, assets that you steal/destroy respawn, soldiers that you kill/fulton respawn, they dont change tactics, at best they get better equipment. They dont talk about you, they dont acknowledge the fact that the outpost they inhabit was taken by a single man, a walking robot/a sniper, a chopper, and nothing you do in the gameworld will ever have an impact.\n\nSupposedly there is a civil war in afghanistan, with several factions fighting and civilians perishing, instead we only get to see the soviets. Civilians? they, 100% of them, ran away so as not to force the coders to work extra. Afghan insurgents? uh... It was too hard to code dynamic AI fighting, like in Far cry 4, so we just say that their zone is further from here and that's it.\n\n3 PMCs fighting in africa? we cant code each other to fight them, so we designate outposts per each PMC, wich acts exactly like the other, talks like the other, and sometimes uses each other resources, implying that its nothing more than a re-skin. The in-game explanation? "they keep to their own, acting neutral to the other" Yeah, in a civil war-time central africa. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.\n\n\nThere are no hallucinations in-game nor in cutscenes. Except once, but that's spoilers. Otherwise, and even tho you wake up 1 month after a 9 years comma, your physical and mental condition far exceeds 95% of the earth population. Vehicles cannot be customized. And so far (although i could be wrong) There are only the standar generic ones. Your own chopper with little to no customization, 2 tanks (one western 1 eastern), 4 APCs (1 western 1 eastern, 1 variant of each, the eastern one with a bunch of missile launchers in the back, the western one with a tank turret), 2 Trucks, 2 cars, but i think you know where i am getting at. So far ive been unable to fulton enemy choppers (so no chopper of the model that was seen in GZ) And there is no way to have a sharpnell-less skin for big boss nor a pre-TPP skin just for the cosmetics, nor there is a way for you to revisit Camp Omega, wich was a promised feature. Several scenes shown in the trailers are not in the game at all too.\n\n\nOverall, i got cucked again for pre-ordering again at full price, thinking that it would be different because it was an MGS game. Now, after getting to the point in wich there is nothing to play and some R&D stuff takes several minutes to unlock, i wish ive had pirated the game instead.","September 1, 2015","false","177.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KazumaKat/recommended/287700/","KazumaKat","KaZumaTree","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KazumaKat/","433 products in account","GET IT!\nTL;DR = Easily a contender for Game Of The Year 2015. Hideo Kojima has done it again, marred only by questionable corporate decisions by Konami. If you have room for one game for the next year (or two), get this!\n\n+ Shockingly well optimized, and will likely be the benchmark for performance in games to come. 1080p/60FPS, buttery smooth, and when it isnt, its so well done that smart use of adaptive motion blur as well as dynamic focus scaling makes it so that the action's not interrupted even in the most heated of moments. And even on the most ancient of potatos, it'll either just straight-up not run (at this point, you have got to be on some silly Pentium 4 or similar, older than my nephew) for obvious reasons, or it'll tone things down to where it tries to maintain a constant FPS at the start. Options for a 30FPS lock as well.\n\n+ A masterpiece of Kojima storytelling, even for non-fans of Metal Gear. Even if this is your first MGS game, you wont feel lost, nor will you ever feel left out. MGS fans will appreciate this as much as newcomers, and maybe even convert them over.\n\n+ A perfectly blended mix of 3P shooting action mechanics, tactical sneaking that the series is known for, open-world freedom and exploration (and resource exploitation), taking care of your own base with its little Pokemon-like gotta-catch-em-all soldier capturing mechanic. You can even go ahead of a planned mission to do recon, plan routes, and even infiltrate and take out vital base resources like the power generator, comms, and air radar and they'll remain down when you have a mission in the same area! (Spoiler: You get a storyline mission that you can IMMEDIATELY complete even before you land if certain events in the mission zone are already handled...)\n\n+ Already EASILY 40 hours worth of content IN CHAPTER 1 ALONE! And that's just rushing things! This game may be a 70-100hr monster, and you wont want to rush it, thats for sure!\n\n~~~~~\n\n- 60FPS top lock (seen as Auto in settings). Arguements can be said that there are technical, design, and performance reasons for such a lock, but it is there, and can be seen by some noticeable pop-in in larger areas.\n\n- Kojima storytelling, complete with lengthy cutscenes that have a bit too much fat on them and go for a bit too long. If you disliked MGS because of how long such cutscenes are, apologies, but this game carries that same banner.\n\n- As much as the mechanics are all very well blended together, they are still a blend of mechanics that have issues when brought together into on game without proper UI support. Chief among which is the control problems when handling large menus and lists in your iDroid (easily seen when managing Mother Base staff). This is exacerbated by the lack of mouse support in menus at all. Another problem is the required precision of one's fingers no matter the control method when handling something like CQC. You can end up grabbing your opponent when you intended to disarm and hold up instead, or end up throwing a 5-hit combo when you wanted to throw. Also there is a lack of feedback when bases and outposts you have gone through have "restocked", repairing the damage you have put it through, which can be a bit of a surprise when going through a base you've sabotaged completely only to discover they have power again.\n\n- Game requires a long-term investiture of time and effort to complete, even when rushing through things. The game also has a sizable portion of its significant, plot-important content hidden behind some Side Ops, hidden areas on your base that you may not even visit, and such.\n\n- The story is almost too large and encompassing, and due to the fallout between Hideo Kojima and Konami, that critical storyline plot points in the end were not completed in time, and judging from the deluxe boxed versions of the game (which had an extra CD containing extra videos of cut cutscenes) that there are arguements that the game is actually incomplete.\n\n- Controversial multiplayer FOB microtransaction execution, as well as shoddy server power to handle launch week. Whilst one can indeed earn the microtransaction-obtained MB Coins via the Daily Login Award, the amounts are questionably low as well as getting it is difficult as it is due to the servers being spotty at the best of times, two weeks from launch.\n\n- Forced multiplayer FOB. It seems that the multiplayer portion of this game is forced upon no no matter the player's discretion, which can be seen as a detriment to solo-play enthusiasts. On top of this, multiplayer FOB "raiding" mechanics are obfuscated and confusing to newcomers, which does not help dissuade the percieved difficulty cliff and skill gap between those who actively play FOB multiplayer, and those who are just trying to play the singleplayer portion of the game without losing men or resources. FOB's past the first one given to you by the game are also exorbitantly expensive, which in itself is bad enough given microtransactions in a full-price game.","September 6, 2015","true","312.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

So this is the first time ive got actually something bad to say about any metal gear solid...\n\n\nYou see, i consider myself an MGS fanboy. I think the saga is the best videogame saga that has ever been created and i think MGS1 is the best game in all mankind. That being said, i finished the game after playing for over 100 hours in one entire week (didn't even play another game) and i am at 57% completition.\n\nThat being said, the game has its flaws\n\n\nFlaws, simple flaws like an awful checkpoint system, frustrating people when even if you die while calling for the exfil chopper, the checkpoint takes you back to the start of the mission, or having most of the 2nd chapter missions be just the same as the first chapter but in higher difficulty or with their own challenge tweaks.\n\nWhat its NOT a simple flaw its the way the story is paced. After 30 missions, people finish the chapter one with a very badass cutscene, and then proceed at snail pace through the (less than 10) story missions of the 2nd chapter to finish the game. See the problem here? 30 unique missions in chapter 1, and 20 in chapter 2, wich over half of them are just the same as their chapter one counterparts except with "slower health regeneration, no chicken hat, no reflex mode" or "mission fails when you get detected". Still, with a gameplay THIS solid, having just a few problems (problems like the cover system, or the quite unperfect hitboxes), i didn't mind going through these missions again, just for the sake of the fun of it. Of course, at one point i was able to unlock the last few missions, wich incluided the quiet's ending (wich, honestly, made me tear a little bit) with the side effect of the permanent removal of quiet as a buddy (♥♥♥♥ing you when you used her a lot or when you spent a lot of GMP in her upgrades) and being unable to ever recover her again, for the sake of storytelling and lore i was able to say "ok, that ♥♥♥♥ happened, but i can still enjoy the game".\n\n\nThen i played the lastest story mission (not the lastest listed mission, wich is just the Sahelantropus fight in harder difficulty).\n\nI was trying to tell myself that i could still enjoy the game after that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ slap-in-the-face ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t cliffhanger ending, wich didn't explained anything, left A LOT of questions. I wouldn't mind that last part, if not... because... you know, this is the LAST MGS game kojima will direct? Yeah, big problem leaving the last game that will ever be made end in a cliffhanger, and its not like the last level was any fun, it was the same thing as just the prologue, just from a different perspective, and then they try to flush down answers through tapes that you acquired after finishing the game.\n\nThe game goes slowly telling you what's going on, some main ops being about the story, some others being more realistic stuff snake would do if he got the job, and the game is packed with very heavy moments that dont force players to feel, but its very likely that they do.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mortsyn/recommended/287700/","mortsyn","Mörtsyn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mortsyn/","403 products in account","The Phantom Pain is a pretty special game. While undoubtley very polished gameplay wise, there's definitely something missing there story wise. Arguably, it has the weakest story out of all Metal Gear Solid games by Hideo Kojima. Not necessarily bad, but definitely a step down from the other games. While Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots had too much literal fanservice for its own good, it at least did feel like a proper conclusion to the overall story. Is this a case of Konami meddling, forcing Kojima to remove a lot of story sections in order to release the game on September 1st? Or is this Kojima's way of taking in the "constant cutscenes" feedback? Who knows? We may never know, or at least not for a very long time.\n\nBut despite the hiccups with the story, the gameplay is nothing short of excellent. While the missions can be fairly repetitive, especially the side-ops, the overall feel of the game is extra ordinary, and a huge step-up from the other games in the franchise. The amount of ways you can do the missions, and the amount of personal restrictions you can put onto yourself is simply overwhelming. It's extremely fun to experiment new ways of playing and discovering new ways to complete a mission. Building your base isn't too different from the way you did it in Peace Walker, but there are a few tweaks that overall makes it a more fully fleshed-out system.\n\nThough one has to wonder if this is really Metal Gear Solid 5. While Kojima has pronounced the title as five, to him, it's in actuality V. Because despite The Phantom Pain (together with Ground Zeroes) and Peace Walker being continuations of Big Boss's story that started in Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, just like the safe-to-say spin-off  Portable Ops, none of them are in fact numbered, signaling that the main series really did end with Guns of the Patriots, and everything else are just supplementary materials. None of these three games were ever really necessary stories that needed to be told, as MGS 4 did end every single plotline from MGS 1-3. And truth be told, MGS 3 is the only story in Big Boss's life that's important to the overall story of the series; While it did not show us how he became the villain, it did show us the start of his descent as a hero.\n\nAs for the controversial ending\nI was initially against it, primarily due to one of the reasons why I was so hyped for this game was exactly because I wanted to see Big Boss turn into the Big Bad. After following him through Snake Eater, Portable Ops, Peace Walker, and Ground Zeroes, naturally I wanted to see the moment the transformation really happened.\nBut after thinking about it, it was actually a pretty good farewell from Kojima to his fans, as we are Venom, and he is Big Boss. We built this series together, and it will never be over as long as we continue to play the games.\n\nSo story wise, I have my problems with it. But meta wise, much like Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, it's an amazing message from the developer to the player. Still, one could argue that Big Boss's actions in this game, despite not being there, are indeed very villainous and hypocritical to his own beliefs, 10-20 years ago.\n\nEither way, having been a fan of this series for almost 15 years, I can safetly say that The Phantom Pain does offer some form of closure, not as a story, but to me as a player of this legendary saga that will never die.\n\nHere's to you, Kojima. I don't regret playing any of your games, The Phantom Pain included.","January 9","true","369.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/solaris32/recommended/287700/","solaris32","solaris32","http://steamcommunity.com/id/solaris32/","2004 products in account","I've finally beaten the game and I've given myself many days to think about it. Finally I've decided that although I've gotten many hours of mostly enjoyment, I can't call this a good game. The prologue level is amazing the first time you play it, but the game overall just goes downhill from there. The gameplay mechanics are widely considered the best in the series (although certain things are taken out like being able to shoot enemies' handheld radios), and I agree. But considering the length of this game we need more than just stellar gameplay mechanics. Sadly that is not to be.\n\nI liked that this is an open worlds game, but that's also a big problem; there are no indoor levels (except a small to medium sized cave if you count that). Every single area in the game you must approach from the outside and every single area is arranged outside. There aren't really any buildings you have to navigate through with multiple stories. Basically there's no real variety. At least they were smart and had the guard placements randomized. You'll be visiting the same areas over and over, a lot more so if you do the side-ops. The repetiveness in this game is gigantic.\n\nTo help stem the repetiveness you do have weapons development to work on throughout the whole game. To develop weapons and other items and to use them it requires GMP (essentially money) and resources. They also threw in a waiting time for weapons to develop to further slow your progress. You get GMP for all sorts of things, and resources you mainly get by finding them in the world and deployment missions. This was fun at first but it didn't take long before it became a chore to grind out the necessary supplies.\n\nThe biggest flaw of the game is easily the story and characters, or lack there of. You, Big Boss, rarely talk in the game and when you do it's only a short sentence or two. The rest of the time it's just the other characters simply being exposition and info dumps. There's very little personality development for any of them. But the biggest slap in the face are the godawful cassette tapes. Instead of giving us proper cutscenes they have these audio only cassettes where it's basically just the person (not Big Boss) talking to themself about whatever the subject is. It's incredibly boring and lame. Gone are the traditional codec conversations you can have with the various people you're with. Instead you point your binoculars at certain places on a map and can get brief messages about it, but that's it. I think Kojima took the complaints of MGS4's excessive cutscenes too far by giving us very little cutscenes in this game. I would talk about the disappointment of the characters themselves, such as the wasted potential of the villain Skullface, but I don't want to give spoilers. I will say I'm not happy about the explanation for why Quiet doesn't wear clothes because it just boils down to shameless fan service. Also, the game doesn't explain why she doesnt write/type messages to communicate, which is a bit of a plot hole, considering what she could have (and it's fairly clear wanted) to tell them. Finally, the game doesn't give an ending, just reveals the twist that the game not so subtetly hinted at in the very beginning.\n\nAnother complaint is all the filler missions. Having the repetitive side-ops is one thing, but it's another to add in the pointless missions from some "client". It's only there to artificially inflate the length. The locations of the main story missions take place at boxed off areas of the map, a map you have access to in free roam as well. The problem is when you do the story missions these areas are rarely much different than if you decided to visit them in free roam. Generally the only thing story missions add are vehicles the enemy uses which you will rarely see in free roam.\n\nAfter completing mission 22 you get the ability to build an FOB. FOBs are seperate from your motherbase. They generate their own unprocessed resources, which can be stolen by other players, but when it gets processed it goes into your main pile and that cannot be stolen. You can have guards on your FOB to protect against players, and fortunately you can designate the max rank of these guards so you don't get your high level guards stolen. You can even have 0 guards guarding if you want, so that the only thing people can steal are the unprocessed resources they generate, but who cares. The problems come when you decide to invade someone else's FOB. The deck is very heavily stacked against you, the invader, if another player comes to defend against you. They have infinite respawns, and you can't enter the winning door if the guards are alerted to your presence, and it takes several minutes for this alert to go away. Of course you yourself have only 1 life. And all this is assuming you don't run into a cheater because this game has absolutely no anti-cheat software. My recommendation is to invade a couple FOBs just to see what it's like, then after you've inevitable lost because the defender camped the door sniping you, ignore invading FOBs. Just be happy with the free resources you get and the extra space for your minions in their job categories. Even if someone invades your FOB I would ignore it because it means you have to quit and lose your progress to go defend, which means starting a mission all over, and most of the time the people disconnect when they see someone coming to defend because they know it's virtually hopeless.\n\nMy final thoughts are to get this game when it's heavily on sale, and get it strictly for the gameplay.","September 17, 2015","false","82.6"," 33 of 60 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","33","60","0","0"

I'm now 40+ more hours under my belt, and I have to reconsider my review.\n\nMetal Gear Solid V broke my heart.\n\nThe first mission, where you go through the hospital, was the last time I felt like I was playing a Metal Gear Solid game.  You get introduced to the enemies, the supernatural threats, and absurdly heavy cinematography in a linear stealth experience.  Of course, the gameplay didn't have the "tactical freedom" that's currently being advertised in the blurb for the game, but it was still fun and tense.\n\nThen we get introduced to Mother Base, a culmination of what I'm ♥♥♥♥ing sick of in gaming.  The platforms are absurdly spaced from each other because rendering.  I get that this is a memory concern, but I'd just rather have everything clumped into buildings, instead of a giant open platform.  You have a bunch of inferior soldiers who get to go on fun missions like blowing up supplies or defending a bunch of wimpy losers.  I don't want my followers to do the missions for me, why can't it just be an option to use them instead?  Furthermore, the supporting characters are nowhere to be seen (if you can find Ocelot or Kaz anywhere on the deck outside of a cutscene, I never found it).  You basically go there to take a shower and go back on your chopper.\n\nThe Open world stealth was almost good.  Ignoring the game breaking buddies, the stealth zones are largely worse Camp Omegas from Ground Zeroes.  It's all outside in ♥♥♥♥♥♥ environments with the only reason to go inside are for collectibles for useless ♥♥♥♥ that, let's be honest, you don't use.  The game's marking system is remarkably similar to Far Cry 3.  The system is unique to MGSV, as the other games either had you using the soliton radar, your solid eye detecting sound patterns, or, absolutely nothing.  Marking is cool, but it feels out of place.  Most of the guns and gadgets suck, and the ones that are cool inhibit your rank.  Like with the previous 10 years of the series, stick to the tranq gun, unless the bad guys start packing helmets and riot shields.  In which case lie down, try not to cry, and cry a lot.\n\nThis is the worst story I've seen in a Metal Gear Solid game.  It ♥♥♥♥s around for 19 missions, we get plot, and then the game ends in 31 missions.  I can count the amount of cutscenes on one hand.  Codec calls are gone.  They were taken out back and shot like David Hayter's VO (Kiefer does a good job, when he actually talks), supposedly a whole bunch of content, and Kojima's place in Konami. The main villain, Skull Face, has his whole plot revolve around he grew up speaking English.  I simplified it because I didn't want to spoil too much.  The metal gear of this game is somehow larger and more threatening than Excelsus, even though it's 30 years before that was created.  Actually, this metal gear made for a pretty fun boss fight of you waiting for your chopper to start blasting away on it while you don't die.  I liked this boss fight, I wish it wasn't one of two in the game.  The game, however, does tie up any and all loose ends you may have about the series (that couldn't be already explained).  You know, because even though Metal Gear Solid 4 did that, we had to do it again.\n\nForward Operating Bases cost over 1000 MB coins to unlock, and I only had 85 after playing for 50+ hours.  Thank god I didn't like the system they had in place.  I don't like the idea of sending my soldiers and resources to get extracted.  Something comes up about disarming nukes or arming yourselves with nukes and becoming a demon.  I never played Metal Gear Solid for multiplayer, and I wish they didn't shove it down my throat this time.\n\nI heard about the game's reveal back so long ago I don't even remember.  I didn't want it then.  Of course, I just can't leave the collection of my favorite game series of all time incomplete.  Of course, the trailers and characters did enough to convince me that this game would be worth the 60$ (hell, I got Ground Zeroes for 5$ fully knowing even that wasn't a good value).  Was it worth 60$?  Well, the gameplay felt just shy of superb, and the story is almost irredeemable.  Something kept me going though.  However, I can't recommend this game to anybody.  Like I said, this game broke my heart in a Hideo-us way.\n\nFinal Words: "You're going to extract him?"","September 13, 2015","false","108.0"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

A double album, it was released posthumously following his death on March 9, 1997. It features collaborations with guest artists such as 112, Jay-Z, Lil' Kim, Mase, Bone Thugs-n-Harmony, Too $hort, Angela Winbush, D.M.C. of Run-D.M.C., R. Kelly, The LOX, and Puff Daddy. Life After Death exhibits The Notorious B.I.G. further delving into the mafioso rap subgenre. The album acts as a sequel to his debut Ready to Die and picks up where the last song "Toshinou Kyouko" ends.\n\nThe album was nominated for three Grammy Awards in 1998, including Best Rap Album, Best Rap Solo Performance for its first single "Hypnotize", and Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group for its second single "Mo Yuru Mo Yuri". Along with Raekwon's Only Built 4 Cuban Linx… (1995), AZ's Doe Or Die (1995), Jay-Z's Reasonable Doubt (1996), and Nas' It Was Written (1996) Life After Death has been considered by music writers as one of the seminal mafioso rap albums, as well as a landmark in hip hop music. In 2003, the album was ranked number 476 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nAlso the game is like Peace Walker if you cut out 80% of the content and made it open world. If you want a better overall experience let alone one from the Metal Gear series go pick up Peace Walker because it is still the crowning achievement of the entire franchise (yeah that means it is better than Snake Eater you nerdass).","January 7","true","235.5"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","7","10","2","1"

Not to mention it’s incredibly well optimized. The mother base is quite a neat idea and a nice addition to the game, although later in the game it becomes a logistical nightmare. The game also does a poor job of explaining its mechanics and systems though you will get the hang of them eventually.\n\nThe prologue and the first act are overall quite stellar, however the second act, the ending and how a certain villain meets his fate is utter garbage. It really suffers in terms of story; it’s just really weak and incredibly unsatisfying. What also doesn’t help is how repetitive and pointless side ops are.\n\nOverall really enjoyable despite its issues\n\nMy rating: 9/10 great game","January 2","true","45.8"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Slightly ruined by Konami.\n\n\nToo much game!\n\nThe complexity depth and scope of this game is hard to sum up or indeed fathom.\nBuilt on the foundations of earlier games and incorporating mechanics and ideas from those titles as well as some brand new ones, all of this placed in TWO massive free roaming combat arenas.\nIts almost too much game! Not in the way that there are too many “collectables” or stuff like that to pick up but in a way that makes you feel like you are just one man trying to defeat a massive army.\n\n\nKonami are EVIL!\n\nI am a fan of these games and played them back when they came out. But when this game came out I was not a fan!\nLike many people I was on the Konami sucks train and was shocked and appalled by the way the game locked away the stuff you earn and offered it to other players to steal! Then they announced that you would be able to “insure” your stuff by paying them! Konami were essentially using Mafia style strong arm extortion racketeering on it faithful players!!\n\nThat said I never had any problems unless it couldn't sign in to the servers and on my second play through its a lot less shocking. I know the stuff I don't just sell immediately might get “locked” and I will have to wait (like a FB p2p game) to unlock that stuff again or just get new stuff. Also I like making my base super deadly and watching people fail to take it down, then being like “wow good job” when someone actually does!\n\n\nWhat Story?!\n\nI know allot has been said about the story, but I think after all the other games its not so bad to keep the story minimal. The fact that it is in between games with strong stories and is trying to tie them together, means it finds itself restricted in what it can do. I mean they're not going to kill Snake or Ocelot are they? The fact that this is a “filler” game trying to fit in is evident in the two regions you visit. I love the Africa area and its crazy to think that the pixilated top down original game and this are basically the same thing in the same place!\n\nPlus points:\nGreat gameplay.\nGood Graphics.\nStable FPS.\nLarge world.\nMany weapons / items to choose from.\nLots of vehicles drive / get dropped in.\nThe whole supply drop / bombardment system.\nThe Fulton system.\nDifferent characters to play as.\nThe buddy(s).\nKooky weirdness and hiding in boxes.\n\nMinus Points:\nKonami\nBadly implemented pay to play system that nobody needs or wants and was just an attempt at extortion by Konami.\nHave to connect to bad servers or your stuff is stolen by Konami.\nBad (unrealistic) physics (its not a simulator).\nSome buggy gameplay (Its fine when you're used to it).\nSome annoying gameplay (being exposed / attacked in a cut scene), only in story missions.\nOccasionally unrealistic AI responses.\nLong traversals to / in between destinations.\nQuiet.\n\n9/10\nWhen someone on PC hacks the game and locks Konami out of it, I'll give it 10/10!","May 27","true","72.2"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

I can't hear a fourth of the game because there's just no audio balancing, and no "Sound" option to even slightly fix it.","September 26, 2015","true","34.1"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/marieannette/recommended/287700/","marieannette","such a cute acolyte. ♥","http://steamcommunity.com/id/marieannette/","1234 products in account","This is a lovely engine married to a joyless, hollow game and I am so, so sad that there *probably* isn't an Obsidian of weird goofy homoerotic stealth murdergames waiting in the wings to make The Phantom Pain: New Vegas.\n\nThere are some good *moments* in the story, but the narrative is mostly disjointed and flat. There's zero levity aside from the idolmas posters that everyone pointedly ignores and DD. Skull Face doesn't get a scrap of interesting motivation or character depth until 70+ hours in and then you're like *god*, why couldn't Kojima have spent less time on the generic themed boss unit and torturing Huey and hamhandedly trying to tie stuff from previous games into the new one, part a billion and more time on making his characters seem like fully realized human beings? Kiefer Snaketherland barely talks. Huey exists to be tortured until he drops the next plot point (but it's okay bc he's secretly a monster!!!). The Serious Backstory Reason for why Quiet runs around afghanistan in ripped tights and a bikini is ridiculous and kind of insulting? Like, she's kind of cool otherwise but the whole OH I HAVE TO BE ALMOST NAKED OR ELSE I'LL DIE WEEOOWEEOO (which doesn't even work because if clothing basically asphyxiates her /why is she wearing tights/ are the rips for her thigh gills or something ) thing kind of ruins it.\n\nOcelot is underused. Kaz is surly and shouty and dull. Instead of codecs or cutscenes, a lot of the background information and exposition is in tapes, and if you try to listen to the tapes while you're *doing* anything more often than not you'll trigger a voiceover from Kaz or Ocelot and have to start over after they're done telling you about wormwood or w/e. I mean, I get *why* they probably did this - some people don't want to sit through half an hour per go of somebody talking over stock footage and want to get right to the shooting mans or feeding on treefrogs or w/e, but it kinda hurts more than helps.\n\nOn its own, the gameplay is fun, but it wears thin because the Phantom Pain is pretty much Grindy Timesink: the Game. You need a ton of GMP both to pay for loadouts and to develop weapons, which means you need to do side missions in a bunch of far-flung parts of the map that take forever to get to (it's not as bad once you get to Africa, but it's miserableeeee in Afghanistan) because you don't get the ability to fulton vehicles until several hours in and D-Horse is sadly not a bionic racehorse or anything. On top of that, items take 18/36/72/144 minutes in real-time to develop (and you can't close the game and and come back later to find them done, like with DA: Inquisition or something). Grade 7+ weapons and items *can* be developed while you're offline, but they take *literal days* to develop, so...it's kind of a mixed bag.\n\nThe side missions themselves get real old real quick - the travel time could be forgiven if they were varied or had neat little gimmicks, but it's the same few mission types all the way down (with like...what, a literal handful of exceptions?). Extract someone or pick up something, kill a group/blow up vehicles, clear mines, repeat 157 times. These were fun, at first! But doing over a hundred of the same side ops makes them wear really, *really* thin.\n\nSome of the main missions are fun, but a lot of them feel kind of random and disconnected from the narrative. The boss encounters are some of the most tedious, unfun things I've found in the entire MG series. (i was gonna make a Snake's Revenge joke but nothing's coming so long story short i uh hope you like fruitlessly trying to dodge zombie 100m hurdle champions with perfect aim and bottomless magazines, among other things) The bosses themselves don't really have...*anything* in the way of unique backstory or character, to the point that they make the Tarted-up Trauma Brigade from MGS4 look deep and well-rounded by comparison.\n\nThe bosses that got recycled from previous games don't count, and they're not used to much interesting effect in TPP anyways. Deal with it, nerds.\n\nThe online is amazing, because they managed to take the worst parts of Dark Souls-style MP and make them /worse/. You can't opt out of the online. If you want to develop Grade 6/7+ gear, you pretty much have to do the online, because it's either rob someone's base or run around picking up stacks of 10 Golden Crescent/Haoma/Digitalis until you reach 1000 or whatever. Like soulsgames MP, there's some PVP - if somebody's playing while you invade their base, they get a notification and can defend, and (like soulsgames!) more often than not the PVP's full of cheap fun-ruining s--t and hackers. Unlike soulsgames MP, you can't opt out of the online, which means people can invade you and steal your FOB soldiers *even when you're not running the game*.\n\nThe personnel requirements for upgrading your base defense items past like...first/second tier pretty much force you to spend the ten bucks in wacky Konami Buttcoins and buy a second FOB. The *resource* requirements for upgrading force you to invade a bunch of FOBs (unless you like a lot more tedium), which means you run into the other problem. There's no real diversity in FOBs' *layout*, only their level of defense, and *that* tends to stick to a pretty strict binary -- either they're 1/2 platform FOBs with minimal defenses and modest rewards and really boring, or they're 3/4 platform FOBs where the platforms are saturated with lasers and cameras and UAVs and soldiers with grade 6/7 Battle Dress and you're dead two seconds after you get spotted regardless of running or dodging because unless DD digs up an Old Hunter's Bone *no one can run that fast*.\n\nIt's not exactly a ton of fun.\n\nThe incidental music is good. The Official 80s Music(tm) is kind of lacking. Less She Blinded Me with Science (ughhhhhh), more punk and Cocteau Twins.\n\n3/10 would drag myself to the near-end out of spite and what might be stockholm syndrome and spend way too much GMP to give Quiet some actual people clothes again.","February 11","false","141.5"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","8","12","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/paragus/recommended/287700/","paragus","Paragus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/paragus/","180 products in account","This game was massively overhyped and under delivered.  Maybe I'm the only guy with what will probably be an unpopular point of view with this, but this game could have been amazing.   It starts off pretty well, hits all the right notes, and Act 1 of the game, which is massive turns out to be half decent.\n\nThe second half of the game going into Act 2, while having a few memorable moments, is otherwise a complete disaster.  Over half of the missions in the second half of the game consist of you replaying missions from the first half of the game, but with gimmicks to make them harder.  They completely have nothing to do with the story at all, and some of them are stupidly conceived that it feels like a chore to keep playing.  Every so often they will throw you a little piece of story, then back to the replaying of the old crap.  This goes all the way to the end of the game, literally.   The final mission and the ending are such a massive disappointment in every way, that I'm baffled how any reviewer worth his salt could have found the conclusion to this game to be anything other than a flop.\n\nI'm frankly not interested in hearing the tale of how the end of the game was forced to be cut down, you are charging a premium price for a game like this, it should deliver a premium experience.  Compared to the narratives of the previous MGS games, this is a compete dud.\n\nIn terms of the gameplay elements, there's a lot to like here, but a dose of really poorly desgined annoyances.   The "open-world" isn't really that open at all in terms of one of the games maps is just a series of hallways with mountains and cliffs keeping you on the rails.  Trying to fast travel the map is ill conceived and explained via boxes.  You'll spend a ton of time sitting in the chopper waiting for the thing to land and take off, making you wonder why any designer thought the tedium of this was a good idea.\n\nWhen you go on missions, the game decides to pretty much spoil you by telling you every character you will see on the mission before your feet hit the ground.  This pretty much ruins any plot surprises when you the major villain is going to be seen in the mission before you land when you otherwise wouldn't have known.  Don't foreshadow the plot if you want it to have impact for God' sake!\n\nSpeaking of the plot, 90% of it is told through little audio tapes that you have to sit there and listen to, and the main character you play barely speaks through most of the game.  Eventually, you get tired of shuffling through tapes and listening to mostly mundane coversation while trying to find major plot points burried in a sea of dribble.\n\nDon't buy this unless it's deeply dicounted.  It's a nice looking game with some nice gameplay elements, but in a series where story is huge this game flops massively.","December 23, 2015","false","47.7"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","1"

It started out with potential, but the litany of things grew.  I didn't like the inability to jump and would find this exceedingly aggrevating when trying to escape a firefight.  But the glitchy slides up rock faces and the almost jerky movement would further my dislike of Snake.  The psychotically long runs between places didn't add to the realism, so much as make for some very boring running.  And Snake sounds like he runs with the horses, he's so noisy.\nAlso, trying to figure out how to assign your team to do missions behind the scenes was an exercise in futility.  I never managed to have one successful outing.  What about side missions - no, not the actual side missions, but the ones that allow 100% completion of a mission?  Well you don't even get to know what they are until you complete the mission one full time, meaning you have to do every mission at least twice if you want to complete everything.  And actual side missions?  You can complete one a dozen times and somehow it keeps coming back!\nLastly, speaking of running too far... what about your base.  Even using a helicopter to "fast travel" seems to be a display of how it really would be circling repeatedly over a base... again and again until landing.\nOverall, I've played many first and third person games and have finished all of them.  This is the first time I feel I grossly wasted money - I uninstalled it after mission 11.  I kept trying to go back to it, to complete it, but found it too tedious.  There are better games out there and I've spent my money far better on Steam in the past.  This was a major let down.\nSadly, I far exceeded my time on it so can't get a refund.

It provides players with a lot of options of how to tackle obstacles. It gives you all the tools you need to do whatever you want to do to the point most of the game becomes absurdly easy. The graphics and optimization are all fantastic as well, but these things have all been covered elsewhere. If you don't care about story, you'll love MGSV and you should pick it up.\n\nThat said, the gameplay is flawed in quite a few ways. The latter stages of the game are just repeats of missions you've already done with the difficulty amped up, there's very little motivation to play them other than a slow grind so you can get through with the few remaining story missions. This is worsened by the Side-Ops which quickly just turn into generic slaughterfests where you repeat the same thing over and over just to progress the game.\n\nThe game clearly doesn't feel finished. It's obvious that whatever was happening at Konami left Kojima with an unfinished product he had to rush out the door, and it shows. Aside from the repetitiveness in the missions (as well as how few main story missions there are), the multiplayer was also neglected. FOBs were initially promised to be customizeable bases players could personalize alongside a Dark Souls-like co-op feature, but neither of these are the case. Each FOB is an exact clone of Mother Base, you're essentially just playing the same map over and over with different guards and defenses. It also becomes practically impossible to win as an attacker against any decent players - the amount of guards the enemy has combined with their ridiculously short respawn timer of 25 seconds means on most maps the defender can simply rush you down and win through attrition no matter how many times they die.\n\nThese things are mostly excuseable. The main issue here is the story. Kojima introduces an interesting plot in Ground Zeroes with Big Boss being put in a coma and Skullface being introduced as a reprehensible villain with shadowy motives.  Players pick up the Phantom Pain expecting a story of revenge as Boss goes on a rampage to take down Skullface and by extension, Cipher, but ultimately players are left disappointed.\n\nSpoilers ahead\nHeavy story spoilers from here on in;\n\nSkullface's motives ultimately make no sense. Players are never made aware of who exactly he is or why he's doing what he's doing. His plans are ultimately contradictory and rely on psuedoscience to the point that the writers had to literally rewrite human evolution and biology to accomodate it. It's incredibly jarring and ultimately you're forced to just go along with it because the nonsensical plotline is built entirely around it. In Ground Zeroes players are built up to expect one of the darkest antagonists Metal Gear has had, yet ultimately all he does is raise more questions that his inclusion fails to answer because of his utter irrelevance as a character.\n\nThe weakness of Skullface as a character could be excused if we were introduced to more antagonists to support him, as is common in most Metal Gear games. In MGS1 we had Foxhound, in MGS2 we had Dead Cell, in MGS3 we had the Cobra Unit and in MGS4 we had the Beauty and the Beast Unit. Each of these groups contained a number of interesting antagonists who each had specific powers which provided the player with challenges throughout the game - characters like Vulcan Raven, Psycho Mantis and Revolver Ocelot are probably much more memorable to people than Liquid Snake, for instance. There is no such counterpart in MGSV - Skullface's only supporting cast are the Third Child and the Man on Fire, both of whom are excellent characters but ultimately they serve as the only real boss enemies in the game. There's also the Skulls, who are essentially completely mute zombies with no personality or sentience that don't really serve as interesting villains.\n\nThe side-characters unfortunately suffer a lot of the same issues. Miller is a perpeptually whiny manchild who borders on treason more or less entirely throughout the game, leading players to wonder why he was ever considered Boss' right-hand man. Quiet is a fairly interesting character, but her relevance to the storyline is ultimately minimal outside of certain missions. She was clearly written with the fact that some players would choose not to bring her back to Mother Base in mind.\n\nAnd then we get to the ending. I won't spoil the ending directly, but needless to say it completely destroys any enjoyment the player may have taken from the story. We're led to believe that the player is witnessing Big Boss' descent into an anti-hero, yet for the most part all we see is a typical good guy. The few moments of badassery displayed (that is, the ones that aren't ruined by Huey acting like a ♥♥♥♥wit) are completely wiped away as Kojima asspulls a twist that makes absolutely no sense and renders the events of the game completely irrelevant. It's as though Kojima was trying to recreate the same mind♥♥♥♥ery he came up with in MGS2 but it completely falls flat on its face. It's completely disappointing for the player, it ruins any emotional investment they may have had in the game or its characters and it unfortunately has negative repercussions for the consistency and lore of the other games in the series. With MGSV being the last Metal Gear planned to work on, I'd been hoping for closure to any remaining plotholes and more insight into one of the series' central characters. Instead Kojima fails to to so adequately and instead raises even more questions with a bizarre M. Night Shyamalan-esque twist.\n\nSpoilers end\nIn short, MGSV is a fun game, but it's an awful Metal Gear game. MGS4 was highly criticized for its total fanservice, but it at least looked at the characters of Metal Gear and tried to give them closure. MGSV does the opposite - it's only tangentially about Metal Gear, instead it's more like a reinvention of the entire series for a new audience. And even if the awful storyline and characters are disregarded, the game itself is artificially inflated through dozens of repetitive side mission, needless timesinks and the latter half of the game literally just making the player repeat missions they've already finished.\n\nYou'll enjoy the first half and get sucked into the story, but by the end you'll feel disappointed by a game that's clearly unfinished and tries to make up for it with ridiculously stupid twists that'd make even the Colonel in MGS2 blush.","September 9, 2015","false","120.1"," 30 of 55 people (55%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","55","30","55","5","0"

MGSV does the opposite - it's only tangentially about Metal Gear, instead it's more like a reinvention of the entire series for a new audience. And even if the awful storyline and characters are disregarded, the game itself is artificially inflated through dozens of repetitive side mission, needless timesinks and the latter half of the game literally just making the player repeat missions they've already finished.\n\nYou'll enjoy the first half and get sucked into the story, but by the end you'll feel disappointed by a game that's clearly unfinished and tries to make up for it with ridiculously stupid twists that'd make even the Colonel in MGS2 blush.","September 9, 2015","false","120.1"," 30 of 55 people (55%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","55","30","55","5","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TwistyOtter/recommended/287700/","TwistyOtter","Twisty","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TwistyOtter/","416 products in account","This is a review for MGO, not for TPP.\nAlright, so. No this is not a review for the Phantom Pain. This is a review for Metal Gear Online. I'm not here to discuss the singleplayer aspect of the game, I'm here to discuss the multiplayer aspect of the game.\n\nFirst off, Metal Gear Solid V has an excellent singeplayer, albeit the lack of content and the feeling of it being rushed, it's a very good experience.\n\nThe multiplayer aspect of the game, however, isn't. Yes I know, it's a beta. But we all know that the beta is only there for server stress testing.\n\nUPDATE: The game's out of beta after two days, no patch notes anywhere, still no text chat and still no option for push to talk, dedicated servers, etc. This review still stands as is!\n\nServer performance and connection\nThe game's performance is great, but the server performance isn't. There's a P2P connection between players just like with the console version, which also has terrible networking.\n\nFor those who don't know, a P2P (short for peer to peer) connection. Is a connection between computers and a main server that stores all your exp, coins and points. But, instead of the server being physically there to host your game, your game data is streamed between all the players in the game, thus creating a 'virtual' server. This virtual server is hosted by one player in the game, which has supossedly the best connection out of all players.\n\nThe reason I put in the word supposedly is because this player can have a dial-up connection and still be the host. The game solely looks at ping and not at up and down speeds. This creates big frustrations like getting killed around corners, kill delays and my personal favorite: kill trading!\n\nAnother great thing about this is that CQC, which is a core gameplay mechanic of Metal Gear Solid V, isn't going to work. Why? Because people will start teleporting all over the place, dodging CQC is next to impossible and people can grab you from meters away.\n\nAlso there is no in-game text chat and no push to talk, all mics are open by default and you can't type anything besides pre-made in-game phrases.\n\nSpawn points\nAnother controversial thing, the spawn points in MGO are in one word; terrible. The game has this one hangar map where the spawn points of both teams are literally on the other side of the building. This building is around 5 x 20 meters. Which isn't big, at all. You can just rush in as an Enforcer and shoot everybody in the face. Spawn protection is about two seconds and that's not enough to shoot somebody else that's shooting you.\n\nThis is only a problem in the two game modes that aren't clock and dagger, I'll get to that in a bit.\n\n\nGame modes, or lack thereof\nThe game supports a total of three game modes which aren't really utilizing the entire stealth mechanic of Metal Gear Solid V.\n\nBounty Hunter: Basically the EXP grind mode / TDM mode. Players start off with a set amount of tickets. Every kill results into the opposite team losing a ticket. If the amount of tickets reaches zero, you win. However, you can earn tickets by fulton extracting enemy teammates. With every kill you earn a bounty point, the more points you have, the more point the enemy team will gain when they fulton extract you.\n\nCloak and Dagger: Probably the most fun mode. The game is 6 v 6 where the player either has to defende a data disk or extract a data disk. The ones that defend the disk are equiped with lethal weaponry, whilst the attackers are equiped with non lethal guns. The key here is stealth and teamwork.\n\nComm Control: Basically Call of Duty's domination gamemode, kinda the same as Bounty Hunter.\n\nOverall the modes are very basic and they lack depth. They don't utilize the game's singleplayer mechanics as well. Specifically stealth mechanics aren't used properly in all the modes. The modes aren't really fun, either. It's just rushing because of the short five minute timer. More modes would mean the game would get some more depth, which I would seriously support!\n\nBalancing\nThe game tries it's best at balancing but to be honest, it's not really possible to do so with all the current weaponry and perks.\n\nFor instance, within the Cloak and Dagger gamemode, it's possible for the non-lethal attacking team to take out the entire enemy team with snipers. Players are cloaked permanently until they get spotted, which is rather hard in dark maps. If the entire team chooses to take non-lethal snipers, they can snipe the enemy team from a distance and win the game.\n\nIn Bounty Hunter, which is basically TDM, you can be an Enforcer and shoot four RPGs per life. That's... quite a lot since they can kill about two to three players with one well-placed shot.\n\nCustomization and classes\nThe game has three classes, each supporting their pros and cons.\n\nEnforcer: Basically your go-to character if you want to run and gun. The enforcer supports high damage weaponry, explosives and more health than any other classes. He has the firepower, but lacks the finesse.\n\nScout: Your sniper character, great for long-distance battles. But lacks in short range as he's easily flankable if you're careful enough.\n\nInfiltrator: My personal favorite. The Infiltrator is a class mainly focused on stealth. He's fast, he's low on health but has a couple of fun abilities like the ability to use cloak.\n\nCustomization is... well, limited. Weaponry and some perks are locked to your class. Most paint jobs for your gun cost actual money and some customization to your character also costs money, which is a big shame.\n\nRounding up\nThe multiplayer is basically lacking in depth, its got its pros, its got its cons. It's fun if you're with friends, but playing with random people that don't play the objective isn't a fun experience.\n\nIf the game gets more balanced, the networking gets fixed up and if they implement text chat I'll update the review.

The story was not very good. From chapter 1 it doesn't give you much incentive to really care about getting revenge on Skull Face, even if you've played Ground Zeroes - and it all feels anti-climactic all the way through.. especially after chapter 2, where the plot falls apart and feels disjointed and scattered. I think this was Kojima's intention, to give players the feeling of "Phantom Pain" but it still leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. There is a twist that retcons a lot of things in the series - and depending on your perspective, that can be a good or bad thing. For me it's a bad thing. Konami also removed a crap load of content that was supposed to be in the game. Apparently there was supposed to be a third chapter, but they rushed Kojima to put it all out as quickly as possible. This is not the story Kojima wanted to tell.. at least I don't think it was.\n\n2. The missions are repetitive and few offer any relation to the story. It becomes boring when the majority of your gameplay consists of\n- 3 minute helicopter ride\n- sprint to location\n- fulton target or blow something up\n- escape\n\nI really, truly felt like MGSV could have been the greatest game in the series - and in gameplay it truly is.. but the flaws really make it difficult for me to call this a masterpiece.\n\n"Masterpiece.\n\nI played Ground Zeroes, the standalone prologue to this game for well over 30 hours - mastered every nook and cranny and never really got bored of it despite it's scope. Going into the Phantom Pain, I expected to beast everything with my acquired skills. I was wrong, and in a great way. The game tested my merit in many ways and caused me to approach missions in ways I never expected I would.\n\nThe Phantom Pain is the crowning achievement of Hideo Kojima. His swan song - in a sense. The sheer amount of tactical freedom the game gives you is mindblowing. Although there aren't a lot of cutscenes, besides in the prologue and maybe in later portions - and it's not "as" story driven as it's predecessors, but with gameplay like this I really couldn't give a damn.\n\nI was so sure the Witcher 3 would be my Game of the Year.. but now I have to say TPP takes the cake. No game I've ever played has this amount of polish, content and variety. It lived up to every claim Kojima made, and then some."","September 1, 2015","true","98.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Theres 3 versions as far as i know.\n\nSPOILERS (But who gives a ♥♥♥♥)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe three versions I KNOW OF:\n\n1. Normal version: Chopper explodes by Paz jumping out and the bomb going off, killing her and knockin down the chopper and messing up Big Boss (the "horn" and coma)\n\n2. Paz's version: She lived, they got both bombs out and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ perspective doesnt show that a rocket hit near the cockpit of the helicopter even though it looks like Paz exploded.\n\n3. Medic Version: The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you play as is a ♥♥♥♥ing nobody extra character that was IN FRONT of Big Boss to take the explosion for him, leaving the medic guy hurt and boss with a few bruises.\n\n\n\n\n\nTerrible perspectives sell.\n\n\nThere's so much wrong with this game it's upsetting. It kicks off slow which is fine, but when it goes it gets going (Nowhere)! Save a prisoner! COOL! He makes prosthetic arms! That sounds useful! ^.^ ok cool! NEXT, save another prisoner. Okay, done, he didn't advance the plot or give any cool intel. Next mission! Kill this guy, he does bad stuff to the people of Afghanistan. Ok wait. Since when do we care? we're out for revenge and now we're doing charity work for people in the region the main villain happens to be in? Why? we only operate there, our base isnt there. Our forces arent there. Nothing is there. Why are main story missions WASTED on saving 9000 prisoners and blowing up 50 tanks and stealing useless junk? there are 200 missions in the game including side missions. Less than 10% of those missions advance the plot. 50 main story missions in total. about 15 are repeats with a twist. Making for forced VR which some players will probably not be able to complete due to difficulty. about 20 are worthless fetch quests and the last 15 are the story. The very loose, poorly made story. With a villain that seems cool at first, but quits halfway through and explains his motives, goes back on them. Gives you praises, stops trying to kill you, picks up his motives again, goes back on them AGAIN, quits again and puts himself in a widely nonsensical situation where he dies on purpose, leaving the most badass man on the planet to play with his cute little robot which is a pushover boss fight because in his mind it'll kill Big Boss the Legendary Solider who stopped World War 3 by himself. He knows you are badass because he explains how he tied those loose ends of you single handedly stopping world war 3. But no, a robot will stop you. DEFINITELY.\n\n\n\n\nEND OF SPOILERS\n\n\n\nSaving Grace is the gameplay in some aspects. The AI is buggy in the PC port. The PS4 version has much more intelligent AI to the point where its most likely a different scripting system. They are noticably smarter in every way. Especially during combat alerts. When they lose sight of you. They check where you were and where you could've gone. In PC they just check where you were and say, "Eh ♥♥♥♥ it he died". But if you shoot them with a silenced weapon from nearly 60 meters out, they know exactly where you are. In the dark or in a sandstorm doesnt matter.\n\nPROS:\n\n+Optimization is great, 60FPS is constant even during intense action scenes. though dust effects from driving cars has huge dips if the camera is angled just right.\n\n+Controls are solid on a gamepad\n\n+Stealth feels mostly believable. AI has some issues as you draw in very close however.\n\n+Plenty of missions\n\n+Mother base is great as is, management is fun and expanding is cool. Platforms are spread out a bit too far for my liking.\n\nCONS:\n\n-Loose plot with strange villains. Not strange in a good way, their motives are so roundabout they could've been doing something else.\n\n-Story could've been more prominent as with every single other metal gear game\n\n-Open world has nothing in it. Could've been linear and would've worked way better.\n\n-PC AI is iffy. Some detections are highly debatable.\n\n-keyboard controls are very poor. Only 2 crouch walking speeds, Normal and slow as balls.\n\n-either consumed by revenge as a character or just being weird, Miller doesn't act like Miller. Making stupid decisions left and right.\n\n-too many convenient plot devices. Especially the one tied to mother base mid game.\n\n-The easily seen coming twist at the end was hardly believable. In my opinion, sucked.\n\n5/10 Doesn't sit right with me, this is the last metal gear, but definitely far from the definitive. I won't say the game overall sucked, just too much of it did where it could've been amazing. a shell of a metal gear, much like the protagonist himself.","September 5, 2015","false","114.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Medic Version: The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you play as is a ♥♥♥♥ing nobody extra character that was IN FRONT of Big Boss to take the explosion for him, leaving the medic guy hurt and boss with a few bruises.\n\n\n\n\n\nTerrible perspectives sell.\n\n\nThere's so much wrong with this game it's upsetting. It kicks off slow which is fine, but when it goes it gets going (Nowhere)! Save a prisoner! COOL! He makes prosthetic arms! That sounds useful! ^.^ ok cool! NEXT, save another prisoner. Okay, done, he didn't advance the plot or give any cool intel. Next mission! Kill this guy, he does bad stuff to the people of Afghanistan. Ok wait. Since when do we care? we're out for revenge and now we're doing charity work for people in the region the main villain happens to be in? Why? we only operate there, our base isnt there. Our forces arent there. Nothing is there. Why are main story missions WASTED on saving 9000 prisoners and blowing up 50 tanks and stealing useless junk? there are 200 missions in the game including side missions. Less than 10% of those missions advance the plot. 50 main story missions in total. about 15 are repeats with a twist. Making for forced VR which some players will probably not be able to complete due to difficulty. about 20 are worthless fetch quests and the last 15 are the story. The very loose, poorly made story. With a villain that seems cool at first, but quits halfway through and explains his motives, goes back on them. Gives you praises, stops trying to kill you, picks up his motives again, goes back on them AGAIN, quits again and puts himself in a widely nonsensical situation where he dies on purpose, leaving the most badass man on the planet to play with his cute little robot which is a pushover boss fight because in his mind it'll kill Big Boss the Legendary Solider who stopped World War 3 by himself. He knows you are badass because he explains how he tied those loose ends of you single handedly stopping world war 3. But no, a robot will stop you. DEFINITELY.\n\n\n\n\nEND OF SPOILERS\n\n\n\nSaving Grace is the gameplay in some aspects. The AI is buggy in the PC port. The PS4 version has much more intelligent AI to the point where its most likely a different scripting system. They are noticably smarter in every way. Especially during combat alerts. When they lose sight of you. They check where you were and where you could've gone. In PC they just check where you were and say, "Eh ♥♥♥♥ it he died". But if you shoot them with a silenced weapon from nearly 60 meters out, they know exactly where you are. In the dark or in a sandstorm doesnt matter.\n\nPROS:\n\n+Optimization is great, 60FPS is constant even during intense action scenes. though dust effects from driving cars has huge dips if the camera is angled just right.\n\n+Controls are solid on a gamepad\n\n+Stealth feels mostly believable. AI has some issues as you draw in very close however.\n\n+Plenty of missions\n\n+Mother base is great as is, management is fun and expanding is cool. Platforms are spread out a bit too far for my liking.\n\nCONS:\n\n-Loose plot with strange villains. Not strange in a good way, their motives are so roundabout they could've been doing something else.\n\n-Story could've been more prominent as with every single other metal gear game\n\n-Open world has nothing in it. Could've been linear and would've worked way better.\n\n-PC AI is iffy. Some detections are highly debatable.\n\n-keyboard controls are very poor. Only 2 crouch walking speeds, Normal and slow as balls.\n\n-either consumed by revenge as a character or just being weird, Miller doesn't act like Miller. Making stupid decisions left and right.\n\n-too many convenient plot devices. Especially the one tied to mother base mid game.\n\n-The easily seen coming twist at the end was hardly believable. In my opinion, sucked.\n\n5/10 Doesn't sit right with me, this is the last metal gear, but definitely far from the definitive. I won't say the game overall sucked, just too much of it did where it could've been amazing. a shell of a metal gear, much like the protagonist himself.","September 5, 2015","false","114.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

They will also conduct search parties for you and cover entry/exit points. They really do search for you too, the AI is brilliant in that regard.\n\nAll this and the game runs and looks like a dream.

The gameplay trailers they did for this game are an accurate depiction of what you can do.  Great game.  Its story missions are split up like a TV show series.

You can play for 30 mins to 1 hour, complete a mission, and have a satisfying conclusion.  The story is actually interesting as well.  MGS 2 turned me off to the series due to its overuse of melodrama.  Kojima definitely turned it way down for this.

The story was not very good. From chapter 1 it doesn't give you much incentive to really care about getting revenge on Skull Face, even if you've played Ground Zeroes - and it all feels anti-climactic all the way through.. especially after chapter 2, where the plot falls apart and feels disjointed and scattered. I think this was Kojima's intention, to give players the feeling of "Phantom Pain" but it still leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. There is a twist that retcons a lot of things in the series - and depending on your perspective, that can be a good or bad thing. For me it's a bad thing. Konami also removed a crap load of content that was supposed to be in the game. Apparently there was supposed to be a third chapter, but they rushed Kojima to put it all out as quickly as possible. This is not the story Kojima wanted to tell.. at least I don't think it was.\n\n2. The missions are repetitive and few offer any relation to the story. It becomes boring when the majority of your gameplay consists of\n- 3 minute helicopter ride\n- sprint to location\n- fulton target or blow something up\n- escape\n\nI really, truly felt like MGSV could have been the greatest game in the series - and in gameplay it truly is.. but the flaws really make it difficult for me to call this a masterpiece.\n\n"Masterpiece.\n\nI played Ground Zeroes, the standalone prologue to this game for well over 30 hours - mastered every nook and cranny and never really got bored of it despite it's scope. Going into the Phantom Pain, I expected to beast everything with my acquired skills. I was wrong, and in a great way. The game tested my merit in many ways and caused me to approach missions in ways I never expected I would.\n\nThe Phantom Pain is the crowning achievement of Hideo Kojima. His swan song - in a sense. The sheer amount of tactical freedom the game gives you is mindblowing. Although there aren't a lot of cutscenes, besides in the prologue and maybe in later portions - and it's not "as" story driven as it's predecessors, but with gameplay like this I really couldn't give a damn.\n\nI was so sure the Witcher 3 would be my Game of the Year.. but now I have to say TPP takes the cake. No game I've ever played has this amount of polish, content and variety. It lived up to every claim Kojima made, and then some."","September 1, 2015","true","98.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Ehhh, idk up to you. I personally wouldn't\n\nShould you buy this game as a huge MGS fan? No.\n\nWhy not?\nWell, simply because you can feel how rushed the game was. It was released prematurely, no doubt about it. There is literally only 3 maps in the game (Afghanistan, Africa, and Mother Base). ALL of them feel barren and like they're all missing something.\n\nSure you can do side quests, but who wants to do the same ♥♥♥♥ over and over again?\nSure you can farm mats to upgrade your weapons, but is that what the MGS series is about?\n\nThe story is okay, and just does not impact you at all like previous games had.

An insult to the fans who have been waiting for a new MGO. No where NEAR as much content as MGO 2. Just a little handful of maps, 3 game modes (No TDM or DM? Seriously?!)\nI'm all for change, but the change in MGO 3 was barely there. Truly saddening.\n\nThe answer to all this is Kojima simply just got ♥♥♥♥ed royally by Konami, and he wasn't able to deliver what he wanted.\n\nAll that being said, this game is actually a very beautiful game, it runs perfect with little to no dips in FPS, the controls are ridiculously smooth, there are some pretty good wtf moments, and the MGS charm is still there even though it is the darkest installment in the series.\n\n8/10\n\nJust wait for it to go on sale, or a version with all the DLC comes out.\nOh, and ♥♥♥♥ YOU KONAMI","March 1","false","97.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Steam will only take three pages. Spoilers are hidden, and the formating is better on GDocs anyway.\n\n\nSo here's the TL;DR version from it's intro and whatever else I could fit in here:\n\nPreemptive TL;DR ReviewThe game is incredibly fun.\nAt least 60 hours minimum in gameplay for Chapter 1.\nMore “replay value” than what Ground Zeros had.\nMultiple ways to play; no one way is the “correct” way (but stealth earns more points).\nYou can drive around the African plains, driving off cliffs, with unconscious guards in the back, all while “Take On Me” plays on your walkman.\n8.5/10\n\nGameplayI could sit here for paragraphs and talk about the new open-world style. Yes, it’s extremely fun and gives you hours of replayability. Don’t feel like sneaking today? How about ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ up in a tank. Want to do missions with (almost) no starting equipment? Go for it. The world is your play thing.\n\nBut you probably already knew that.\n\nRather than blab on about all the open-world mechanics, I want to focus on the one mechanic that really resonated with me; The Response System. In a nutshell, the response system is how the enemy forces react to you. No, a nutshell is too small. Let’s compare it to a frig’en acme-grade boulder. It’s e-uge.\nThe response system was Kojima Production’s way of tailoring the difficulty of Phantom Pain to every individual player. Is your strategy based around vehicular combat? Now enemies have guided missiles. Are you one of those people who just run-and-gun like mindless ♥♥♥♥wats? Have fun with those pinpoint-accurate riot suit guys. Or are you a traditional Metal Gear player, choosing stealth above all? Then watch where you step; there are mines everywhere. Every single strategy has a response specifically designed against it, in a system designed to be your own personal challenge.\nThe response system is broken down into eight separate “response” categories (six visible and two invisible). I want to go as in-depth as possible with this, so here’s a ♥♥♥♥ load of some charts. A quick breakdown:\nCombat response: Triggered by setting off alerts and doing frontal assaults. Enemies are equipped with better weapons and armour, reinforcements increase, and every enemy is hopped up on Diazepam.\nSniper Response: Triggered by hitting enemies from long distances. Snipers are deployed around the map, just waiting to ruin your day.\nVehicle Response: Triggered by getting kills with vehicles. Enemies are deployed with rockets; just two are powerful enough to stop your paper-thin tanks.\nGas Response:Triggered by using gas and smoke grenades on guards, or when they smell the stink of someone who hasn’t showered in 20 missions. Enemies finally figure out the science behind gas masks, making them immune to your gasses.\nHeadshot Response: Triggered by getting headshots. Enemies start wearing helmets, which you’ll respond to by shooting them in their still unprotected face.\nNighttime Response: Triggered when you start doing more night-time vigilante work. Enemies trade in their glowsticks for flashlights, and have a chance to come equipped with night vision goggles so bright they put sam fisher to shame.\nFulton Response: Triggered when you fulton a guard and his buddy happens to catch you in the act. Enemies respond by learning how to shoot a big-♥♥♥ balloon.\nCovert Actions Response: Triggered by neutralizing guards without setting off alerts. Enemies respond by putting up plastic dummies so fake they make lawn flamingos look real.This system is the backbone of the entire open-world machine that is Phantom Pain. Without it, this game would be nothing.\nThat being said, the system isn’t perfect. While it’s designed to be hard for the way you play, it’s never hard enough. Drones and anti-theft devices are never used by the AI. And for someone who had a 1(high) response level in their Covert Actions Response, I only saw one camera throughout the entire game. ONE. The hardest part of the entire game were vehicle battles, which boiled down to how many rockets you could fire off before you got sniped by a tank half a mile away.\nThis stems from the fact that the system is too diverse; difficulty doesn't exactly increase with progress anymore. Completing a few missions using a different tactic, be it intentional or unintentional, automatically lowers responses that were not triggered. Frequently completing missions with varying tactics would often keep the response system at stupid easy levels. The end-game of Phantom Pain for me was almost identical to the beginning missions, as I had somehow created a permanent half-combat, half-Covert Action response level. While it was nice to see such an in-depth difficulty system in use, they should have also incorporated elements of the standard “enemies get tougher as the game progresses” model. That would have created a perfect balance between personal-difficulty and progress-difficulty.\n\nScoring System\nNow this next part probably won’t make any sense to people who haven’t played Peace Walker. Stick with me here, this is the main reason why I think Phantom Pain is better than it’s predecessor Peace Walker, and why it makes Phantom Pain one of the more unique entries in the series to date.\nFirst, let’s talk about the scoring/rank system that was in Peace Walker, as it is what the current system is based off of. The scoring system in Peace Walker graded you on a basic criteria at the end of each mission: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=600341225\nGiven that system, you were very limited in how you could play. Sure, you could run through with the CAW (fully automatic shotgun that held 7 shots) and the Patriot (The Boss’ weapon, has unlimited ammo) and wreak everyone, but doing so would get you a low rank. To achieve an S rank, you'd have to sprint towards the objective, headshotting every guard along the way with your tranq pistol. This was almost a requirement, as getting a high rank (S rank) was required to get better (cool as ♥♥♥♥) gear. We’re talking about stuff like the Railgun, Stealth Camo, EM Net, Vulcan Minigun, The End’s suit (from MGS3), The Boss’ weapon “Patriot”, and The Banana (yes, you can use a banana as a weapon). So long story short, stealth was practically the only/best way to play.\nAnd this was Peace Walker’s biggest downfall. Here’s a game where you can develop an absolute ♥♥♥♥ load of weapons. Peace Walker had around 98 weapons: 63.5 of said weapons were lethal weapons (which you could only use on AI boss fights), 25 weapons were gimmick weapons (magazines, smoke grenades, LR and PR guns, etc.), and only 9.5 weapons were non-lethal. 9.5. I have all these crazy ♥♥♥ guns and I'm stuck using the same 9.5 almost every mission. I want to use the minigun, I want to use the CAW. But I can’t. This severely restricted your playstyles and how you could play the game. I hated it.\nThen Phantom Pain happened. While Phantom Pain’s grading system was still similar to Peace Walker’s, it improved it in about every area that Peace Walker failed:Time is still the largest factor in your rank.\nAlerts don’t pen\nOut of space.

While fans of the older MGS games will be disappointed with the story, the gameplay has a ton to offer. The story isnt as bad as people say (Including the missing mission 51 we know little about). The 2 open world locations each have many things to them and are very fun to roam around. Most missions are pretty fun the first few times, with some being a pain, with the majority of those being the replay missions in Chapter 2 to "add more content". The All weapons OSP challenges were fun, bringing me back to the older mgs games with snake/raiden/big boss being forced to go in with no weapons and fight. As of this review, I have played only one match of MGO3, but it wasnt bad when I did. The FOB raids add some more replayability to the game, with there being special events, PVP against defenders, and stealing nukes that take 24 hours with the game open to make, just to defuse them and ruin their dreams. While I may not recommend going for 100%, with many tedious tasks involved such as animal grinding, all 140+ side ops, the weapons having to be made only while the game is open, and all the mission tasks (some being broken), its a very fun game, and is worth everyones time to atleast get to the main ending.","March 16","true","230.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Guthar/recommended/287700/","Guthar","Guthar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Guthar/","344 products in account","Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain.... What is there to say. I've waited years for this game. I've waited longer for an actual PC release of any Metal Gear Solid game. Ground Zeroes came out awhile ago and it was like a tease. We all witnessed what the fox engine could do. That the team behind the PC version was comminted to making a good port. We just had to wait.\n\n\nI started my Metal Gear Solid journey when I was a kid. For my 12th birthday my Dad bought me a Playstation. He didn't understand that you had to also buy games for it. So all I had that summer was a demo disk that came with the system. On this disk was a bunch of games you could play for a few minutes at a time and then they would end. I played all the games that looked fun to me a hundred times. Tony Hawk 1 was on this disk. I played that first level "Hanger" 2 minutes at a time probably a thousand times that summer. After awhile I got bored. I looked at the games I didn't play on the disk and stumbled upon "Metal Gear Solid." At first glance it didn't look like something I would care for. Being bored enough I decided to give it a shot. The demo was of the very first part of the game where your goal is to make it to the elevator without being seen. After many failed attempts I got the hang of it. As the elevator started ascending, the cutscene started. Man was that awesome. I knew that if there was any game I wanted to play this was the one. Years go by, and Metal Gear Solid is my favorite series. I played each game multiple times (besides Peace Walker). Now that I'm a PC gamer, when I heard (over a year ago) that MGSV was coming to the PC I couldn't believe it. I was so excited.\n\nThe Day finally comes and I played it maybe 12 hours that first day. It was nothing like I imagined. The first real open world in a Metal Gear Solid game sounds amazing to me. As I went from outpost to outpost collecting materials and kidnapping soliders to work for me I felt something was missing. This is far from the games I played growing up. Not in a bad way. I joked with friends that this game plays more like Far Cry 3 then like the Metal Gear Solid I knew.\n\nGone are the 20 minute cutscenes that a lot of people didn't like (I loved them btw.) Call it what you want, Metal Gear Solid was story first for me. Don't get me wrong I love the updated gameplay for todays standards. I feel that a open world is something that Metal Gear Solid always needed. I just feel like it's lacking on the story front. Most of the story takes place between main missions and what use to be cutscenes has been turned into Cassette Tapes. The Cassette Tapes are great. I guess I'm being a bit nostalgic. I just loved the face to face interaction characters had in the previous games.\n\nThe story is focused. More tight then previous games. You have a goal and nothing will stop you from completing it. The wonder of what really is going on, the questions you have make you want to keep playing to find the answers. Who is this, why are they doing that. Both things I've asked myself while playing. It's kept me playing this game 12 hours a day since release. I'm hooked and I want more. The plot goes from believable to goofy in seconds. That's what I've always loved about this series. Some people expecting a standard military operation story will be caught off guard by the usual Kojima wierdness. The mix of the Scifi and Military plot is confusing at times, but once you think about it, the scifi elements are not to far fetched.\n\nGameplay is simular to Metal Gear Solid 4 mixed with Far Cry 3 and sprinkle a little base management ontop of that. I shouldn't call it "little" the base system and soliders you have control of could be its own game. It's massive with work orders, missions and customization for everything. It's overwelming the first time you go through the menus trying to figure out what you should do. Controls are fantastic and I've had little trouble getting use to playing a Metal Gear Solid game using a keyboard and a mouse. It feels like Metal Gear was always on the PC. I've had some trouble with the horse and robot not stopping when I wanted to, either that's a bug or I'm doing something wrong. The aiming with the mouse is so far superior then the controller in my opinion.\n\nThe sound of this game is top notch. Everything from the sound track, to the roaring of the helicopters to the slamming of the helicopter door that made me jump out of my seat. Shots from gunfire hit dirt and rocks around you and make you feel like you are actually getting shot at. The Music that plays on boomboxes around camps and outposts (that you can steal) will make you smile. The customzation to have your own music play or the in game songs while playing or make  your helicopter play as it comes to pick you up. You can hear "OHH HERE SHE COMES, SHES A MANEATER" echo through the hills and desert, and its simply fantastic.\n\nThe Graphics are stunning. Everything from the sun setting on the lush African forest, to the vast hills of Afghanistan. The blood spatter on your face after going on a killing rampage sticks with you until you take a shower or stand in rain. The dynamic weather systems that disrupt you or help you complete tasks. Hiding in a sandstorm or masking your footsteps to the sound of rain. The water puddles that form and the wet landscape that shines when the rain stops is pure beauty. Texture wise the game has a few flaws, but nothing that will take away from the experience.\n\nOne major problem I had with the game was the pre-mission and post-mission credits. Not so much that it happens before and after every missions, but that if you pay attention to the pre-mission credits it tells you who is "Guest Starring" which can spoil the surprise. For instance everytime the "skulls" where going to show up in a mission, I knew they were coming. BECAUSE THE STUPID OPENING CREDITS! Seriously that is bulls**t. I want that to be a surprise. God damnit Kojima.. why...\n\nAt times I feel certain things are repetitive. Picking up materials,plants,fultoning a guy back to mother base can all feel a little overused. Just when you feel that everything is really the same, you realize that there are a hundred different ways to attack each base. Tons of combos of buddies you can use to attack it a different way. Trying each time to do it faster, without making a mistake. You could use a silenced sniper rifle if you are farther in the game and just silent kill everyone if you wanted. That will lower your score though. The real greatness of this game is when you take the silent apporch and do no kill, no alerts runs. That's when this game shines. The limitless gadgets you can use, the hundreds of weapons and handful of buddies that can help you out makes this game a true masterpiece.\n\nPlay the way you want, enjoy the epic AAA film style story, Be the Boss of the base, Lead your men into combat and extract revenge from your foes. Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is a Masterpiece. Not of the same kind Metal Gear Solid 1 or 3 was. But this is a new era. In this new era there is only one king of storytelling, His name is Hideo Kojima. This is his game.\n\nA Hideo Kojima Game\nRating: 10/10\n\nDOWN WITH KONAMI","September 3, 2015","true","101.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

While fans of the older MGS games will be disappointed with the story, the gameplay has a ton to offer. The story isnt as bad as people say (Including the missing mission 51 we know little about). The 2 open world locations each have many things to them and are very fun to roam around. Most missions are pretty fun the first few times, with some being a pain, with the majority of those being the replay missions in Chapter 2 to "add more content". The All weapons OSP challenges were fun, bringing me back to the older mgs games with snake/raiden/big boss being forced to go in with no weapons and fight. As of this review, I have played only one match of MGO3, but it wasnt bad when I did. The FOB raids add some more replayability to the game, with there being special events, PVP against defenders, and stealing nukes that take 24 hours with the game open to make, just to defuse them and ruin their dreams. While I may not recommend going for 100%, with many tedious tasks involved such as animal grinding, all 140+ side ops, the weapons having to be made only while the game is open, and all the mission tasks (some being broken), its a very fun game, and is worth everyones time to atleast get to the main ending.","March 16","true","230.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

Steam will only take three pages. Spoilers are hidden, and the formating is better on GDocs anyway.\n\n\nSo here's the TL;DR version from it's intro and whatever else I could fit in here:\n\nPreemptive TL;DR ReviewThe game is incredibly fun.\nAt least 60 hours minimum in gameplay for Chapter 1.\nMore “replay value” than what Ground Zeros had.\nMultiple ways to play; no one way is the “correct” way (but stealth earns more points).\nYou can drive around the African plains, driving off cliffs, with unconscious guards in the back, all while “Take On Me” plays on your walkman.\n8.5/10\n\nGameplayI could sit here for paragraphs and talk about the new open-world style. Yes, it’s extremely fun and gives you hours of replayability. Don’t feel like sneaking today? How about ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ up in a tank. Want to do missions with (almost) no starting equipment? Go for it. The world is your play thing.\n\nBut you probably already knew that.\n\nRather than blab on about all the open-world mechanics, I want to focus on the one mechanic that really resonated with me; The Response System. In a nutshell, the response system is how the enemy forces react to you. No, a nutshell is too small. Let’s compare it to a frig’en acme-grade boulder. It’s e-uge.\nThe response system was Kojima Production’s way of tailoring the difficulty of Phantom Pain to every individual player. Is your strategy based around vehicular combat? Now enemies have guided missiles. Are you one of those people who just run-and-gun like mindless ♥♥♥♥wats? Have fun with those pinpoint-accurate riot suit guys. Or are you a traditional Metal Gear player, choosing stealth above all? Then watch where you step; there are mines everywhere. Every single strategy has a response specifically designed against it, in a system designed to be your own personal challenge.\nThe response system is broken down into eight separate “response” categories (six visible and two invisible). I want to go as in-depth as possible with this, so here’s a ♥♥♥♥ load of some charts. A quick breakdown:\nCombat response: Triggered by setting off alerts and doing frontal assaults. Enemies are equipped with better weapons and armour, reinforcements increase, and every enemy is hopped up on Diazepam.\nSniper Response: Triggered by hitting enemies from long distances. Snipers are deployed around the map, just waiting to ruin your day.\nVehicle Response: Triggered by getting kills with vehicles. Enemies are deployed with rockets; just two are powerful enough to stop your paper-thin tanks.\nGas Response:Triggered by using gas and smoke grenades on guards, or when they smell the stink of someone who hasn’t showered in 20 missions. Enemies finally figure out the science behind gas masks, making them immune to your gasses.\nHeadshot Response: Triggered by getting headshots. Enemies start wearing helmets, which you’ll respond to by shooting them in their still unprotected face.\nNighttime Response: Triggered when you start doing more night-time vigilante work. Enemies trade in their glowsticks for flashlights, and have a chance to come equipped with night vision goggles so bright they put sam fisher to shame.\nFulton Response: Triggered when you fulton a guard and his buddy happens to catch you in the act. Enemies respond by learning how to shoot a big-♥♥♥ balloon.\nCovert Actions Response: Triggered by neutralizing guards without setting off alerts. Enemies respond by putting up plastic dummies so fake they make lawn flamingos look real.This system is the backbone of the entire open-world machine that is Phantom Pain. Without it, this game would be nothing.\nThat being said, the system isn’t perfect. While it’s designed to be hard for the way you play, it’s never hard enough. Drones and anti-theft devices are never used by the AI. And for someone who had a 1(high) response level in their Covert Actions Response, I only saw one camera throughout the entire game. ONE. The hardest part of the entire game were vehicle battles, which boiled down to how many rockets you could fire off before you got sniped by a tank half a mile away.\nThis stems from the fact that the system is too diverse; difficulty doesn't exactly increase with progress anymore. Completing a few missions using a different tactic, be it intentional or unintentional, automatically lowers responses that were not triggered. Frequently completing missions with varying tactics would often keep the response system at stupid easy levels. The end-game of Phantom Pain for me was almost identical to the beginning missions, as I had somehow created a permanent half-combat, half-Covert Action response level. While it was nice to see such an in-depth difficulty system in use, they should have also incorporated elements of the standard “enemies get tougher as the game progresses” model. That would have created a perfect balance between personal-difficulty and progress-difficulty.\n\nScoring System\nNow this next part probably won’t make any sense to people who haven’t played Peace Walker. Stick with me here, this is the main reason why I think Phantom Pain is better than it’s predecessor Peace Walker, and why it makes Phantom Pain one of the more unique entries in the series to date.\nFirst, let’s talk about the scoring/rank system that was in Peace Walker, as it is what the current system is based off of. The scoring system in Peace Walker graded you on a basic criteria at the end of each mission: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=600341225\nGiven that system, you were very limited in how you could play. Sure, you could run through with the CAW (fully automatic shotgun that held 7 shots) and the Patriot (The Boss’ weapon, has unlimited ammo) and wreak everyone, but doing so would get you a low rank. To achieve an S rank, you'd have to sprint towards the objective, headshotting every guard along the way with your tranq pistol. This was almost a requirement, as getting a high rank (S rank) was required to get better (cool as ♥♥♥♥) gear. We’re talking about stuff like the Railgun, Stealth Camo, EM Net, Vulcan Minigun, The End’s suit (from MGS3), The Boss’ weapon “Patriot”, and The Banana (yes, you can use a banana as a weapon). So long story short, stealth was practically the only/best way to play.\nAnd this was Peace Walker’s biggest downfall. Here’s a game where you can develop an absolute ♥♥♥♥ load of weapons. Peace Walker had around 98 weapons: 63.5 of said weapons were lethal weapons (which you could only use on AI boss fights), 25 weapons were gimmick weapons (magazines, smoke grenades, LR and PR guns, etc.), and only 9.5 weapons were non-lethal. 9.5. I have all these crazy ♥♥♥ guns and I'm stuck using the same 9.5 almost every mission. I want to use the minigun, I want to use the CAW. But I can’t. This severely restricted your playstyles and how you could play the game. I hated it.\nThen Phantom Pain happened. While Phantom Pain’s grading system was still similar to Peace Walker’s, it improved it in about every area that Peace Walker failed:Time is still the largest factor in your rank.\nAlerts don’t pen\nOut of space.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/verticalcleave/recommended/287700/","verticalcleave","landwhale","http://steamcommunity.com/id/verticalcleave/","831 products in account","Metal Gear Solid games are typically plot-heavy games, so I will break this down in an attempt to avoid spoilers: a list of pros and cons followed by a full review that avoids spoilers as much as possible.\n\nMGS5 has plenty of good things going for it:\n+ Expansive outdoor environments with dozens of military facilities to explore...\n+ A diverse soundtrack from a new composer that combines and builds off of the best tracks in the series...\n+ The best and most complex controls for Snake out of any MGS game, allowing real freedom of movement...\n+ Hundreds of weapons to choose from, including options to edit them and make your own versions...\n+ A long main campaign over a combined 35+ missions (including story side ops)...\n\nHowever, these elements are all dragged down by glaring issues:\n- ... That are often just the same 4-man outpost cookie-cutter stamped across both maps.\n- ... Which is not only missing the series's main theme but feels out of place, using modern synths in a 1984 game.\n- ... Which seems to have input issues regardless of your control scheme, with Snake sometimes moving randomly (sometimes to his death or a mission failure). Even when the controls do work properly they feel loose and inaccurate.\n- ... That are clearly bad or strictly worse than a select few weapons. Many weapon upgrades are simply bigger numbers with occasional add-on slots.\n- ... Which is chock-full of a disgusting amount of padding. The majority of the missions and side ops are simple extraction missions where you sneak in, attach a magic balloon to a prisoner, and then run to a chopper.\n\nFull review (with light spoilers):\n\nFor a game that was supposed to bridge the gap between the original Metal Gear games and the MGS series's later titles, there is very little storytelling or character development here. The only character with real growth is Huey, who is a piece of trash that you (and everyone in the game) grows to hate. Sure, Huey might be the best written character in the series, but it doesn't excuse how everyone else is fueled by revenge and has their arc concluded with revenge. There are also few cutscenes, with most of the meat of the story being told through Codec calls- *ahem* -I mean, cassette tapes. The game also takes a sharp turn from GZ's tone, with Skull Face going from being a creepy, mysterious horror one step ahead of you to being a caricature of a bond villian (who exposes his whole scheme to you during an awkwardly long caravan ride to his "real" base). The worst part is a lot of the story is repeated; you seem to be expected to listen to all of the cassette tapes to get the full story (imagine how bad previous games would've been if you were expected to pay attention to every non-critical Codec call!) and yet the conversations on them are often repeated or paraphrased during the main game! The game also fails to conclude all of its threads appropriately; most notoriously, a cut Mission 51 has shown up on Youtube which concludes a cliffhanger that happens in the middle of Chapter 2. The fact that such an important mission was left undone makes me think that this game was unfinished and rushed out the door, despite being in development for a supposed 5 years.\n\nThere is a lot that could be nitpicked about this game but the biggest issue I have with it is the story. The MGS games have always been known for their story, with lengthy cutscenes and frequent Codec calls crafting a believable parallel world to ours. Snake (despite being voiced by Jack Bauer) is almost a silent protagonist in 5, who doesn't respond to radio communications (the replacement for Codec calls) or even talk to non Diamond Dog characters outside of Mother Base. Even during the ridiculous caravan ride with Skull Face he doesn't say a word during Skull Face's exposition. Snake had some ridiculous writing in the past (often repeating lines and adding a question mark on the end to comical effect) but it makes no sense for him to play the mute during key story points. I understand that Kojima wanted players to insert themselves as Snake this time around... But isn't that what players have always done in this series? People wanted to play as Big Boss and watch his descent into madness as advertised, not play as a silent body double. This might've been an attempt to reproduce the twist that Kojima created with Raiden in MGS2; however, that twist was acceptable because it happened near the beginning of the game. This game's twist just seems like a big "screw you" to the fans. All of this is on top of Kojima's obnoxious handwavium of choice, VOCAL CHORD PARASITES, which have effectively replaced MGS4's nanomachines as being the cause and effect for everything supernatural that happens.\n\nMGS5 could've been a good game had it ended with Chapter 1, could've been a great game with better writing, and could've been an amazing game with more series staples (more & better bosses, more (!) cutscenes, more character development). Things might change in the future; Konami might just be holding out on later chapters to milk the player base for DLC money (MB coins are already disgustingly distorting the singleplayer experience). As it currently stands, I'm going to get everything I can out of this game because its money already spent and its decently playable. However, because of all the glaring issues previously mentioned, plus broken online components such as MGO3 being delayed to January 2016 while consoles get it Oct. 6th and FOBs being invadable while offline, I cannot recommend this game to anyone. Both MGR and even the "paid demo" Ground Zeroes were honestly better Metal Gear Solid games than this embarrassing train wreck of game.","September 13, 2015","false","100.8"," 78 of 149 people (52%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","52","78","149","9","2"

The night and day cycles are very nice. I mean it really depends on how much you want to immerse yourself into the game. You do have to go back to base for main missions thought becasue cutscenes.\n\nI could go on and tell you about all of the cool ways i've completed missions, and those would be the way's that I've done them, but really you should go and explore and be creative in your own way, keep and open mind with this game and just have fun with it, dont be reserved in unlocking and upgrading things, use as much as you want, kill as much as you want for the first playthrough of the story, then go back and be perfect with S rank runs, be more nonlethal to get S rank soldies to volunteer.\n\nOne thing that I did to have a lot of fun with the game is I didn't hit restart checkpoint the first runthrough in story when I got caught out, I just went with whatever happened. Was just a very awesome experience.\n\nThere are a lot of hidden things about this game, I wont list them really as you can find youtube videos on that. But I will tell you that the AI will adapt to how you play, there is no difficulty setting, it goes by your playstyle. So, if you get a lot of headshots, they will start to wear helmets, if you use a lot of lethal weapons they will begin to wear body armor and get upgraded weapons themselves, and if you play at night a lot they will have nightvision goggles, if you use sleep grenades, youll see gas masks, cleymore mines if you go the same route a lot, snipers if you snipe a lot, and if you get spotted a lot, they'll put up more security cameras, plus a few other things they do.\n\nOh, and look for cracks in walls, they lead to alternate paths.\n\nYou get a dog that can pull out a stun stick to go and shock the Sh** out of someone, so you can do really cool combos with that, like if there's two guys, you can order him to stun one and time that with tranqing the other. Or you can equipt him with a knife if you have lethals.\n\nDo not try to find out about the story, and do not let your friends spoil anything for you as your mind will be more blown if you find out things for yourself. However, DO go and find out secrets of the game with no spoilers on youtube.\n\nOne of my favorite things is if you find a sexy babe poster you can put it on your cardboard box that you can hide in, and when you stand up with it a soldier if hes spotted you will run up and just drop his gun and drool at it so you can easily take him out.\n\nUmm, is there antying else?? Most definitly, but I think I've said enough about this game for a recommendation. To me this is a brilliantly designed game. You can rush through the story, but I believe this game deserves to be taken slow. I didnt pass mission 22 until well after 300 hours, and I'm still having fun with the game. There's 50 main missions, a few are repeats but you wont get the actual end scene and credits until mission 46.","May 27","true","689.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","5","7","2","0"

The gameplay is simply sublime (as long as you turn off reflex and auto-aim and never use the chicken hat, you scrubs). It's everything you ever would have wanted a Metal Gear game to be since the first game in the series was released in 1987. When infiltrating a base (pretty much the only thing you really do in this game) everything must be considered, from the lighting, gear, to the camo you're wearing, the whether, everything. The lighting and shadowing in this game looks amazing, and the shadows in particular make for a fun mechanic, as the generated shodows act as cover for the player to sneak through unnoticed. The game is completely immersive when performing missions and I had many moments that felt completely real. Most of the weapons in the game feel tight and well balanced, however the combat is completely ridiculous. The use of stealth can be quickly made redundant by simply running at an enemy and holding the action button, which at first is quite fun as you clothsline and dive at enemies; but after it gets old, the over powered combat is a major game breaker, and could have had a lot more thought put into it.\n\nThere is no ending to this game. It wasn't finished. There is a huge portion of the game missing and no plans to work on it. The story is terrible, and most of it takes place in cutscenes situated at Mother Base where characters argue and fight, eventually to be broken up by snake. The mojority of the games cutscenes feel unfinished and unpolished, and some are so awkward they even belong in a cringe video, for instance the truck scene with Snake and Skull. I could even swear that many of the significant events that take place (of which there aren't many) are had in locations and between characters that weren't originally intended to be used, and that there was not enough time to create the context that the events were supposed to occur in, leaving even some of the more polished cutscenes feeling awkward. This is bad on top of the fact that the story and premise is just a repeat of MGS:PW. it's not unusual for Hideo and team to repeat set pieces as an inside joke, but in this case it really just leaves me feeling like I'm playing the same game again. I would have liked a new experience. From this it can be seen the as much as Konami have been a hinderence to this game, Hideo and team have clearly made some terrible decisions from the word go. (Spoilers) Making you play as NOT Big Boss at NOT Mother Base along aside characters who resemble, but are NOT future members of Foxhound and making it blatently obvious from the first half hour of the game that this is how things are going to be is DEFINITELY one of them.

I've also played the 3rd on ps3 but not to completion. now after this brief introduction I'm gonna write what the game is all about in details below.\n\n- Gameplay:-\n\nso even though I havn’t played metal gear for a long time, I can without a doubt tell you that the gamplay is just plain marvelous this game is semi open world. A mix between deux ex, assassin creed, witcher while throwing metal gear taste in it, so u can expect how good the atmosphere is, I usually switch between mouse/keyboard and xbox 360 controller while gaming and I don’t see any problem switching what so ever. The stealth system is sophisticated and AIs are smart. There are plenty of way you can execute your mission and a lot of stuff you can requisition for your motherbase.\n\n- Motherbase and the game mechanics:-\n\nwhat makes this metal gear special is that snake has grown up and is now the boss, now this move from the devs strikes at heart especially for veterans who have played the series since they were 12 years old. it give you the feeling on how snake and miller has been at this for too long and their now old, matured and met their full potential. Your unit name is diamond dogs and u are running at, and u’ll be adding stuff to it, you have the support team and R&D you can recruit enemy personal and important personal, soldiers etc by knocking them cold and attaching a ballon beacon to where they are transported, you also get assigned missions, side missions from contracters, in asense you work for the government but are now mature enough to be freelancing on your own in order to win cipher and become strong enough to defeat them, u get briefing from your subordinates and u get to pick the mission that u want. And of course u get to rescue, sabotage, spy and gather intel. I feel this game is tailored toward veterans rather than new comers and so I love it.\n-Graphics:-\nthe game looks astonishingly great, it’s very realistic and detailed and suprisinly very well optimized, I 1st thought I won’t be able to play it on my gtx 680 sli but I ended up only fully utilizing on of them. I really love the engine, it kinda look like GTA V but way more realistic and refined and way more optimized. And even on medium to low settings it still look really good. So rest assured if your PC is not in the master PC race you can still play and enjoy this game at 60fps.\n\n-Storyline ( some spoilers ):-\n\nit’s classic metal gear campaign and story, with you belonging to the FOX organization that is fighing the ever expanding cipher organization which I suspect is in bed in the soviets. The story takes place in 80s and has a mix of technological beauty and retro cassettes and themes. That astounishgly protraits how the militaries had a lot of advanced prototypes even for todays standards.\n\n-Is it worth a buy?:-\n\nwell to be honest I wanted to buy this game regardless but then a month ago I got into a giveaway contest and won it!! So I got that working out for me, but I would say it worth it’s price. This game is within the league of fallout 4, GTA V( more worth it) and borderlands series combined. This is a work of art and a game that YOU MUST PLAY even if ur a new comer to the series. For new people this will change you life, our lives have already been changed by the 1st and 2nd metal gear 12 years ago and you life will be changed by this one.

Konami, you're pretty good kid, at being a dirty money grabber.\n\nPretty cool game overall, but just too many bad aspects to really recommend.\nCharacter slides down tiny slopes all the times, 3 steps to the right and you can walk up something steeper just fine.\nEnding didn't feel like an ending, as if at least a whole chapter is missing from the game. Might be The Phantom Chapter.\nThe 'Gear' boss fight was really bland and boring for what should have been an epic boss fight, on that note proper proper boss fights were lacking all together in my opinion.  Skulls feels forced and are easy to cheese, Quiet was okay but felt like a desert End\nBase building all comes down to one (1) resource, which you'll always be lacking. As soon as the parasites were introduced the whole campaign turned generic and got quite predictable\n\nOn the positive side I like being able to bring your style to the field, though killing everything severly impedes your base development.\nFOBs are quite easy to invade, doing it full stealth is pretty hard on well developped bases though (unless cowardly Reflex mode). Start by trying to stealth.

What is left is still an absolute marvel, but one can't help but feel disappointed when looking at the empty space where a complete monument should be.\n\nMetal Gear Solid V (it should probably be pronounced 'vee') is both a massive success and an enormous catastrophe. The gameplay is simply sublime (as long as you turn off reflex and auto-aim and never use the chicken hat, you scrubs). It's everything you ever would have wanted a Metal Gear game to be since the first game in the series was released in 1987. When infiltrating a base (pretty much the only thing you really do in this game) everything must be considered, from the lighting, gear, to the camo you're wearing, the whether, everything. The lighting and shadowing in this game looks amazing, and the shadows in particular make for a fun mechanic, as the generated shodows act as cover for the player to sneak through unnoticed. The game is completely immersive when performing missions and I had many moments that felt completely real. Most of the weapons in the game feel tight and well balanced, however the combat is completely ridiculous. The use of stealth can be quickly made redundant by simply running at an enemy and holding the action button, which at first is quite fun as you clothsline and dive at enemies; but after it gets old, the over powered combat is a major game breaker, and could have had a lot more thought put into it.\n\nThere is no ending to this game. It wasn't finished. There is a huge portion of the game missing and no plans to work on it. The story is terrible, and most of it takes place in cutscenes situated at Mother Base where characters argue and fight, eventually to be broken up by snake. The mojority of the games cutscenes feel unfinished and unpolished, and some are so awkward they even belong in a cringe video, for instance the truck scene with Snake and Skull. I could even swear that many of the significant events that take place (of which there aren't many) are had in locations and between characters that weren't originally intended to be used, and that there was not enough time to create the context that the events were supposed to occur in, leaving even some of the more polished cutscenes feeling awkward. This is bad on top of the fact that the story and premise is just a repeat of MGS:PW. it's not unusual for Hideo and team to repeat set pieces as an inside joke, but in this case it really just leaves me feeling like I'm playing the same game again. I would have liked a new experience. From this it can be seen the as much as Konami have been a hinderence to this game, Hideo and team have clearly made some terrible decisions from the word go. (Spoilers) Making you play as NOT Big Boss at NOT Mother Base along aside characters who resemble, but are NOT future members of Foxhound and making it blatently obvious from the first half hour of the game that this is how things are going to be is DEFINITELY one of them. This extreme subversion of expectations could have been haunting and surreal had it taken place within a finished story, with proper character development and pacing, and there are moments where it is evident that they were trying to achieve just that, but in the context of unfinished game it just makes for an even more embarrassing failure.\n\nDon't expect a good Metal Gear game, and get it when it's cheap, and you'll have a good time.\n\nThe content I've lost... the hours I've lost... won't stop hurting... It's like they're all still there. You feel it, too, don't you? I'm gonna make them give back our game!","November 27, 2015","true","201.0"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

But the game is beautiful, and normally my computer can't handle 30 FPS on a game that still looks that great. Graphics and my computer aside, I never really beat the game. From what I can tell, all of the missions are a general rescue this person, destroy this object, take this object from an outpost etc... But it doesn't really get boring with all of the different ways you can go about doing things. Guns blazing, or just slip and slide past everyone and don't even let them know you were there.

Seriously, you take the "beta" offline (a beta for a service that has been online on consoles for months, by the way) because of a possible exploit where people can get MB coins without buying them (which you've been giving us a few free the whole time anyway, by the way).

I choose negative only because I am forced to pick one or the other, so I flipped a coin.\n\nThis is the best terrible game I have ever played. Beautiful, masturfully directed and voice acted cutscenes interruped by pointless, arbitrary supernatural junk which contributes nothing to the advancement of the plot. Tight, amazingly realistic stealth infiltration mechanics punctuated by unnecessary, unexpected forced-combat missions where you blow up giant robots and fight super soldiers who summon rock missiles. Cutting edge, believable, cooperative enemy AI which, late game, ramps up into godlike awareness. A final act where actual story missions become locked behind repeating harder, cheaper versions of older story missions where you fail instantly at the slightest provocation, and where the game's idea of a checkpoint is "the moment you stepped off the helicopter, and never again".\n\nThis is the first game in a long time that has actually dragged me in enough to make me want to play it for several hours at a time. And yet most of the time I stop playing because I have become disgusted with how grindy/cheap/frustrating something has become. I am grateful that I am not a professional reviewer because I would be horribly torn on what score to give this game. It is simultaneously the best game of 2015, hands down, and one of the most irritating gaming experiences I have had in years.","January 14","false","83.1"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

You have powerfull cutscenes from the beginning of the game that might leave you with many questions... and by leaving I mean unanswered untill you progress far into the story, this might cause you to feel like the story falls short if you focus on doing many side ops. This might also cause you to feel like the objectives in the game start to feel slightly repetitive.\n\nLet me be critical.Optimization 10/10\nI have never encoutered game braking bugs, lags, etc. The game functions smoothly.\n\nGameplay 9.8/10\nThe gameplay is so well done you will feel immersed in the missions.\nYour intelligence will be tested. If you are the kind of player that wants to go with the classic stealth approach you will have to put all your attention into what you are doing, the loadout you are using, and learn the mission to understand how to do it the fastest way and get an S rank. The combat will also feel fun in any other approach you feel like using but you wont feel a full experience unless you try them all or at least go for the stealth one, you will sometimes feel forced to sneak around.\n\nStory 8.1/10\n\nThe story is indeed where this game excells and at the same time falls short, why? simple the game is not finished. Kojima is indeed an artist and I'm going to quote da Vinci to deliver my point here: "Art is never finished, only abandoned." But in the case of this title it was abandoned by force. If you are looking for a full experience then theres a big chance you might see why I am saying this.\n\nVisuals 8.8/10\n\nThe game looks amazing. I felt immersed by the way the world was build from an open world perspective. The weather mechanics are something new to me and they look and feel very realistic. The animations are very well done, the game shines in making you feel like the characters are alive and smart.\n\nSounds 9/10\n\nWeapons, footsteps, bumping into objects, weather, voice acting, the sound of clothing against the ground while snake slides against it... the sound effects are top quality and they couldn't be much better. Various languages are used in the game and you can literally use google translate if you dont have and interpret and it works. The composed music is very touching and inspiring but I feel like it could have been used better or perhaps more often.\n\nThis title is highly recommended by me, and its definitely a game of the year contender. 9.1/10","September 7, 2015","true","211.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","6","9","2","0"

There's not much to do when you've been playing it as long as I have and yes, the game is mostly filler. Konami seem to favour consoles over PC for many reasons, even their app does not work for steam. FOBs get boring fast and there's plenty hackers that will ruin your ♥♥♥♥. As the game is in it's current state it's a nice experience and all but this is a negative review because Konami do nothing about hackers. I have sent several reports to them and I even have repeat offenders (hackers) in my FOBs after months I still see them still able to play the game, I hope that they send out a ban wave before MGO goes live and they all get banned. That would be amazing. I don't care about modders who change their game and have little to no effect on other players, but those who teleport from beginning to end of my base after I deploy to defend my FOB are pathetic, I do not lose defenses unless it's to a hacker and it's damned annoying.\n\nKonami is using MGS V to be as money hungry as possible. There is DLC outfits from previous games that are very iconic that you must purchase for real money. (80p each)\nFOB insurance to make sure your virtual resources are not stolen.

I am a huge MGS fan. I havent played a MGS since Sons of Liberty on the PS2, but I fondly remember spending hundreds of hours in MGS1 (PS1) and MGS2(PS2).\n\nI heard the reviews for MGS5 and the hype took over, I was super excited for this game. Im only 20 hours into it, but am sorely disappointed. So far every misison is just capture this guy or destroy this item. MGS5 tries too hard to jump on the open world bandwagon, instead of sticking to its tried and true roots of an epic stealthy-story-heavy game. The story in this game is told almost exclusively through tape cassettes, since it is mid 1980s after all. The parts that arnt told through the story are amazing. The first 30 or so minutes of the game really raised my expectations.\n\nAs for the good. The stealth mechanics are well done. In some cases, too well done, as it can get frustrating and stressful to play. This is one of the only games I've ever played where I can only do 1-2 missions per sitting due to just not giving a crap anymore as a result of constant failing over and over. The engine plays great. I have not noticed a single hint of slowdown on my GTX 980. The world, while pretty, is bland and full of desert. I havent encountered any sort of environments like other metal gears. Nor have I encountered any boss fights. The game seems like a shallow attempt to reinvent the series into the newest fad, open world games. For me it just doesnt work.\n\nI keep hoping I will reach a mission and Kojima-san will pull another glorious Snake/Raiden switch and MGS5 will be like: "Here is the actual game!" Alas, nothing I have read mentions a pivitol moment like that. Until that happens I just cannot recommend MGS5. Its a good game if you arnt looking for a MGS game, but if you are, stay away. I will change my review when I reach a point where the game interestes me, as of now I am playing it solely because of the MGS name. If it didnt have that name I would of never guessed it to be of the MGS universe.\n\n:(","September 21, 2015","false","21.0"," 28 of 52 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","28","52","0","0"

The gameplay was fantastically fun, with lots of great ways to complete objectives.  Mechanically it is also stellar how well this game was put together.\n\nUnfortunately that is where the good ends.  This is was not the metal gear experience.  It was a hobbled together frankenstein of a time wasting micromanaging open world war monger simulator. The story ends faster than it started leaving you with phantom motivation to even play the game.  None of the characters with the exception of DD, and Quiet had any personality.  The fact that Big Boss “Snake” the hero just seemed to shrug and give no input for everything giving including torture was quite appalling. Yes he just stands there watching, this is the guy who is a hero because he is the master of non-lethal infiltration. The rest of the cast do not even matter, they are just a bunch of weak bullies hungry for power.\n\nThe Metal Gear experience I know is being thrust into an unwinnable situation with nothing but your gadgets and your codec calls for information alone. Not constantly being forced to go back to your main base via loading screens and long helicopter rides and a maddening rate. Fast travel is only available at the main base and not in the combat zones as to make the game take artificially longer, Fallowed by endless repeat fetch quests, and more required base building. Awful…  just awful.\n\nI don’t know if Kojima was forced to make the game like this or not, but it is not Metal Gear worthy.  I wonder if the choices for the music tapes from the game were what he was listening to when he was working on this… thing.\n\nIf you have never played or no nothing about Metal Gear there is a slim chance you may like this game.\n\nIf you love Metal Gear and have played the previous titles STEAR CLEAR.\n\nIf you must know what the game is about, just watch the cut scenes, but even then it is a hallow experience.\n\nI will miss this franchise.\n\nFinal verdict 4/10","October 13, 2015","false","123.2"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","12","21","0","0"

Core gameplay is solid (aside from bad vehicle controls), everything else is bland or worse.  A maliciously paced grind of a game, with ~10 hours of padding between every plot point, and a blatantly unfinished story.  Your "reward" for grinding through it all, is to have Quiet permanently stolen from your buddy roster.  Quiet has been re-added in a recent update.  Obviously, 100% thanks to this review.  You're welcome, world.\n\nLikes:Quiet\nReflex Mode\nGameplay: Intuitive, responsive, replayable\n\nDislikes:No Fast travel\nUnfinished story\nBad Vehicle Controls\nStory padding missions\nNo Hayter, no Snake, Big Medic\nDevelopment timers only run in-game\nOnly 2 maps, which are mostly empty space\nAlmost every mission amounts to "Infiltrate this outpost"\nRe-used missions in Chapter 2, with non-dynamic difficulty\nBuddy system limitations, horse could count as a vehicle, etc\n\n\n★☆☆☆☆ (Multiplayer Update)The multiplayer (which for some reason didn't release with the rest of the game?) is quite possibly the worst multiplayer ever made.  After failing to join several matches through an uninformative loading screen, there are not even enough players to fill a single match, and all of them have horrible pings/lag, because one of them is the host.  And of course, as with all MGOs, this game will be shut down in a few months, making it an irrelevant waste of time, even if it was great.  There is so much wrong here, that I doubt its even fixable, a rare accomplishment.\n\n- Spawn kills, kill trades, unbalanced teams, unbalanced classes, no scoreboard?, short matches, no chat?, unfair modes, aim assist on PC, disgusting netcode & lag, broken TTK, player hosted matches, grenade spam and limited use gadgets, parkour disadvantages, half point assists.  Not a single redeeming quality...  And to top it all off, the multiplayer is an entirely separate app, that you have to quit/load into, to shut down the multiplayer you have to reload the singleplayer version of the game, why?  Did they go out of their way to make every bad design decision imaginable, just for the sake of making the worst game possible?  Sure seems like it.

What's wrong with you?"\n\nMGS4 has deeper gameplay than this game\n\nThe gameplay has been fun since the franchise was frickin born, so you can stop trying to write off MGSV as a success because of that, not to mention Ground Zeroes is a better game and has the same gameplay.\n\nBut wait, you have 200 hours! How can anyone play a game they hate for 200 hours?!\n\nIt took me about 100 hours to get through all the padding and tedium to actually finish the story because I was determined to see some development, like you I fell for Kojima's spell and thought this game would get amazing later on, but it actaully got worse. 20 hours were probably spent idle crying at my desk because the story sucked ♥♥♥, the rest was waiting for items to get developed because everything was on an 18min to 2 hour timer. lolol.\n\nBy the time I was even half way through Chapter 1 and not even in Africa, I knew I was disappointed with the story. When Chapter 2 came and the preview hyped everything up I was excited, thinking... this can get better right? It didn't. It got worse, way worse.\n\nI'm not going to talk about the story, it's half finished and even with the cut mission(s) we know about the game would've still been underwhelming anyway. I'm annoyed at Chapter 1 almost as much as Chapter 2. Especially since the fact that this game might as well have not happened to be honest and we would be none the wiser, this game settles absolutely nothing that we wanted to know.\n\nThe missions are full of fetchquests, Ocelot has been dumbed down to an office administrator and Kaz just yells in your ear constantly to save these random guys because I'm a nice person or because Kaz told me to or something.\n\nWhen some good mission actaully happened or cutscene I was like 'wow its about to get real!' then it was over as soon as I said that to myself.\n\nThe side ops are the worst padding ever, worse than Skyrim. Worse than any padding I've ever experienced. I have more fun grinding in boring turn based RPGs. Literally all 150 missions are the same, have fun with that.\n\nThe only thing this game has going for it was the prologue/intro, but then even replaying it becomes tedious because it's this semi-interactive ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that lasts for an hour and it's NOT fun.\n\nEven the final mission is a rehash of the prologue, and that is just pathetic even by Kojima's standards.\n\nHonestly it's very clear what the problems are with this game, and if you can't see that you're blind. If you enjoy the gameplay I totally understand that, most games these days are like TPP: Victims of empty open worlds full of useless padding.\n\nI give this game a final score of (score removed)/10","October 21, 2015","false","244.5"," 38 of 72 people (53%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","53","38","72","5","16"

And to make it better, the story of the game ends there taking quiet with him.  pvp is interesting in some way, but its very annoying while you are engaged in important missions, and way too punishing for players. You can almost everytime cheese the NPCs and also the players with CQC. And they lack co-op or multiplayer, which they had in peace walker so i dont understand why they decided to take it out.\n\nAnyways im waiting for DLCs for a new map, a co-op *raiding missions or patch that adds a legit 3rd chapter to the game.\n\nTo sum it up its a game with terrific open world system, 20-30hrs worth of main missions, a boring and repetitive pvp, but you have to engage on it to survive, weapon development which 70% of it is worthless ♥♥♥♥.\n\njust buy GTAV if you want this game. or wait until its below 50% of the current price.","September 9, 2015","false","150.0"," 20 of 37 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","20","37","0","1"

Disappointement.\n\nYes the gameplay is nice, yes you can hide there, ride a horse a jeep or a tank.\n\nAs an open world it's not the best open world i've played (empty, lifeless and poor variety of environnement), and I beileive by choosing an open world the level design is pretty wrong with infiltration gameplay indeed: no more tankers or soviet prison that you must escape with nothing but your bare hands as MGS 3, or even disguise yourself as the soviet commander and walk among the ennemy troops.\nEverything of the action is happening "out" there is no building, nothing. And not even speaking of the  diagram of the mission: one mission -> helicopter one mission -> helicopter one mission -> helicopter etc...\n\nThere is no continuity in the story we don't infiltrate an ennemy base anymore.\n\n\nAnd the saddest point of this game: The Story, seriously konami? kojima? I was expecting something else... I didn't cry, my mind hasn't been blown out. The true essence of the Metal gear solid serie is missing in this game.\n\nThe only point there is in common with the previous metal gear solid is the title of the game.\n\nI hope there will be an addon for this game at leat, I feel an empty place in my heart.","September 26, 2015","false","128.5"," 21 of 39 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","21","39","0","1"

I am also a big fan of metal gear series title.\nI decided to review the game SIMPLY only in by TWO different categories: (STORY / ATMOSPHERE), (GAMEPLAY) and i have alot to say about this game.\n\n\nSTORY / ATMOSPHERE\nOkay first of all i explain how much they give you story in the game. I myself am pretty confused how much the game developers decided give players the story at one time sometimes you dont get absolutely no story at all for really really long time and sometimes you get so much of it you feel like you want to skip them and want to start playing(Note: this happends only at prologue when the game starts). Ofcourse i understand its part of MGS series and im big fan of the series becouse of its good story line and long cinematics but in this game they give it to you SO HUGE AND SO RARE amounts the problem is THE RARITY of the story telling. So basicly if you are only after the story and like fast or even medium- forwarding paste story you get really frustrated in this game.\n\nWhen the game starts in prologue chapter its cinematic blasting and every single action is cinematic style and you have no gameplay for an about 1hour of the game it almost feels like Heavy rain title game where you can eat popcorn and watch cinematics without the options to chance the story ofcourse which i would be just fine with that but its not the problem. The real problem is after the prologue there isint much of story telling its quite rare and the game starts to lose atmosphere at some points.\n\nBut after Prologue the real game starts THE SANDBOX experience and it feels like really SLOW and BAD if you are after THE story which you should its metal gear game atleast. You start spending alot time on Main missions how you progress in the game which doesnt absolutely give you any of the main story only for really long time and gives mostly just some random events, random people appear which arent very intresting and you dont get back to them after the mission is done which all seem to be quite irrevelevant on your MAIN story. Sometimes you actually get the feeling like your doing side missions in other sandbox game like GTA title but your actually doing main story mission which is sad when it comes to story and this feeling can keep up on hours and its NOT GOOD.\n\nYou can go on to 2-4 hours depending on your progress without any story then you get small-medium chunk of main story and you always have thirst for more but the game just doesnt give it to you, and you find your self frustrating and grinding boring main missions over and over again AND They are repeating themself ALOT you are getting again into same places just do different stuff you start to get bored and the game feels so grindy when you realize you are going to the same place for a third time then you realize something is off. THE GAME ITSELF IS UNFINNISHED i have seen alot posts about this on internet also on this part atleast.\n\nSo basicly the game forces you to do same content over and over again AND OVER AGAIN. its really bad. When you finnish chapter 1 IT GETS NIGHTMARE when it comes to replay and losing atmospehere the game changes from good to absolute horrible when it comes to story.\n\nIN CHAPTER 2 you do same missions over again and sometimes you get new mission but rarely you spend 90% of your time doing replay missions on ridilous difficulity example do mission 1 without any gear and hard enemies its like playing MGS2 on newgame + on EXTREME difficulity exepct the story is still unfinnished you havent seen all of it. So its like a carrot to a rabbit to keep players in badly designed game THE GAME IS REALLY UNFINNISHED from that part. AND THE GAME HAS only 2 chapters and you only mostly replay old chapter 1 missions in last chapter 2. WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE DESIGN CALL.\n\nthe problem of this type is really bad when it comes to enjoyable story. I myself actually sometimes forgot what even had happened in the story becouse of the long breaks from it and boring repeating main missions without no story or soul in them. Even the story itself is kinda open and most of the times you are kinda confused at start of the games and some mid game cinematics you dont get much of it and some things you just dont GET which is really weird. and havent explained some things that happen propely this has happen to alot of people not just me.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nGameplay itself is quite good atleast in combat mode Snake moves nicely and responses good on movement shooting is good responses nicely.\n\nSneaking on the other hand is quite hard and frustrating they made it that way that if even 1 enemy sees you for 1second the hole Base or surrounding enemies who wouldnt even see you at the moment are also magically seeing you instantly what makes no sense whatsover and starting to instantly shoot you and you cant do much prevent the ALERT mode\nUnlike in older MGS games like MGS2 enemies would actually call reinforcments before alert and you could stop them before that and it actually makes more sense i think its kinda bad design call once again from game devs. But in this game the alert goes instantly off and makes sneaking quite annoying and frustrating biggest design problems in my opinions are the large area's and maps older MGS had small maps and good gameplay on when it comes to sneaking around. In this game maps are absolutely huge and sneaking is quite bad in large MAPS and you get spotted easily and alert is hideous in this game it takes so so long time to lose the alert mode so most of the time you just hit Menu last checkpoint and save alot of time that way. It kinda ruins sneaking experience if you are pressing checkpoint 10-20 times for each missions just becouse of annoying game mechanics kinda ruins the mood.\n\nAlso there is alot of useless stuff in the game like minigames Staff you can control at your motherbase and way too often you dont even get the hang of the old minigames / mechanics and the game already introduces you to another useless mechanic and that kinda makes you frustrated too. The introduction's to these mechanics are flawled sometimes the game dont even tell you all you need to do. But you have to figure out how to press menu things etc on this minigame type of scenarions. There is other crappy stuff too example when you start new mission snake has to look view from his helicopter it might get annoying to look that same view like 60 times in game since they last around 1-2min each also ranking system on missions is bad you can get S the best rank with sneaking mission for just only shooting rocket launcher and playing it like Duke Nukem makes no sense this game would suppose to support sneaking..\n\nGame is pretty much of grinding there is million new weapons you can get of and new items and tools and equipent and partners and vehicles and it gives you alot of game hours like 50+ if you want to do all of this kinda stuff this game provides you might actually like this game. But overall you get frustrated if you are after good Story or atmospehere. The game loses its atmospere quickly and if you are finding experience like OLD MGS this will be disapointment to you as it were for me.","September 18, 2015","false","34.4"," 21 of 39 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","21","39","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SolemnCultist/recommended/287700/","SolemnCultist","SolemnCultist","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SolemnCultist/","366 products in account",""Why are we still here? Just to suffer? Every night, I can feel my leg... and my arm... even my fingers. The body I've lost... the comrades I've lost... won't stop hurting... It's like they're all still there. You feel it, too, don't you? I'm gonna make them give back our past."\n\nThe Phantom Pain Just to get it out of the way: I have not played any other metal gear games next to Rising and now The Phantom Pain. If I state something wrong plot wise, please correct me. Metal Gear Solid V is actually the fourth game in the chronological order (Counting Snake Eater, Peace Walker and Ground Zeroes). The Phantom Pain takes place nine years after Ground Zeroes,  after Big Boss (MGSV SPOILER: and the phantom Boss, AKA the medic) awake from a coma.  when Big Boss awakes from a nine year coma after the events of the Ground Zeroes ending. As Big Boss is helped by a mysterious man and Revolver Ocelot, he escapes from the hospital and heads towards Afghanistan. After Miller is found and rescued, Big Boss, Ocelot and Miller start building The Diamond Dogs; Your very own army.\n\nGameplay The gameplay is said by many one of the best in the Metal Gear franchise. MGS V is an open world game in which you have the freedom to infiltrate many enemy bases and build up the Diamond Dogs. Big Boss does many mission in which the main story finds itself, a clunky revenge tale on the man who set these events in motion; Skull Face. But more about the main story in a bit. The gameplay includes you doing the main missions, side mission (side ops), build up your mother base, deploying your best men on missions and developing new gear for you, your buddies and mother base. You can play any way you like in the open world, you can attack enemy bases with a lot of offense, spewing rockets and grenades at them until the whole base is one with the ground. But the game encourages stealth over a loud attack. The stealth is amazing, which it should be in a Metal Gear Solid game. You have many ways to stealth your way into an enemy base camp, crawling your way to your objective, taking out only the guards that stand in your way. Or slowly taking out the entire base, with some help of you buddies. The buddy system is great, with choice between the sniper 'Quite' (which is very loved in the fan base), D-dog, D-horse (gotta get to those objectives) and D-walker; All of these buddies are handy for killing enemies, making infiltrations easier or just getting form point A to point B. There is also a day and night cycle. The AI will change at night, and you will be able to use the shadows to your best advantage. There is so much more to talk about the gameplay, but for the most you've got to see for yourself.\n\nSound and Music I have been listening to Midge Ure's 'The Man Who Sold The World' since I started playing. The choice of music is just amazing, with tunes like Take On Me, Rebel Yell and more great tunes to keep you company. The sound and music is also used perfectly in many situations, like Quite's humming when she's got an enemy in here sights. Random sandstorms are and tropical rain may occur now and then. A sandstorm lowers your field of vision to a minimum, but the same goes for the enemies. You'll be harder to hear and harder to see. A tropical rain storm will damp sound for you and your enemies, creating a new way to tackle the objective.\n\nStory So the game is perfect right? Nothing wrong with it? We'll that's not true, the story is not that great. With a bigger focus on gameplay and the open world, you can see that it took a toll on the story. Metal Gear is known for it's long and amazing cutscenes, which Metal Gear Solid V does not have. It does have cutscenes, but not as much as many Metal Gear fans would like to have. As I have not played many of the other Metal Gear Games, I did not have a problem with the lack of cutscenes. I did however have a problem with the progress of a certain 'Chapter 2'. I loved and adored chapter 1, and I actually didn't think the story was that bad. But in Chapter 2 the story fell flat on it's face in my opinion. With the exact same missions as Chapter 1 but with a modifier thrown over them to make them harder. These missions are optional of course, but this creates a lack of real main story missions and make chapter 2 just feel like filler. There has also been a lot of divided reactions on the 'plot-twist' at the end of the game. I really liked this twist after reading how this twist fits in with the rest of the games, while a lot of fans felt cheated and disappointed.\n\nConclusion Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is a phenomenal game. With amazing stealth gameplay and a great open world, MGSV makes you return to the game many times. The story is considered OK at best, but I personally really liked it for the most part. The second chapter feels rushed and could've been so much more. The characters are great and the music is amazing. Metal Gear Solid V is an amazing game which might disappoint some fans. But the core gameplay makes for one of the best stealth games you'll find.\n\n9.5/10\n","September 25, 2015","true","48.3"," 21 of 39 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","21","39","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WaRLocKTheoRy/recommended/287700/","WaRLocKTheoRy","WaRLocKTheoRy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WaRLocKTheoRy/","450 products in account","A Fan's Review\n\n\nAn Introduction-I don’t normally write reviews, and I know that this is going to be a big surprise to some people, but I feel like I would be doing an injustice to myself if I didn’t try and share my opinion on this game. I realize that I may be among a small amount of people that feel this way, or maybe I am wrong… Regardless of that, I think that this review is coming from an enormous fan of the series since the NES days and I hope that people reading will respect that. That being said, I will try to organize this well, and make this an objective review.\n\nI down-thumbed this game for a MULTITUDE of COLLECTIVE reasons, I will discuss them in a random and not really specific order, but I hope to cover everything I can without going too crazy long. I will compare this game to its prequels at times, I believe it is fair in some ways and not so in others, although I am aware that this game is very different.  Here we go, boys and girls, it’s a long one.\n\nGAMEPLAY-This game, if you familiar or not, is part of a relatively old series that originated in 1987 (NES release date). Of course the gameplay dramatically changed since then, but this game in particular is, as you may know, a far-cry from the other installments. Open world, Tactical Espionage Action. This is what the game does exceedingly well. MGS always pioneered great gameplay and Mr. Kojima is known to make whatever sacrifices needed to insure this. This game is in no way a BAD game to play, it may very well be the best game to date that allows the player to wander as they wish, doing as they please in a militaristic setting, but I feel it may be the worst Metal Gear.\n\nSTEALTH-It creeps closer to realism in this game, Guard shift changes, weather impacts, flashlights, supply routes, communications, and many more make this game a revolution in the stealth field. Over the course of the game enemies will adapt to YOUR playstyle, giving themselves helmets if you score headshots, flashlights and night vision if you attack more at night. It is very hard to say negatives about this area of the game without splitting hairs, this was the focus of the series and Metal Gear always did this well. Just for difficulties sake, turn off reaction time.\n\nCOMBAT-This is where the game misses a small step. I was hoping for more of an array of customization to Snake’s load out. It is has become the Metal Gear way to have two pistols, one tranquilizer and is .45, especially Big Boss, however this is impossible. The types of weapons you can carry into battle are rather set in stone. That aside, most other things are very well organized and going loud is a very viable option for fun in this game alongside sneaking, making them wish they never spotted you.\n\nCUSTOMIZATION-This is, in my opinion, the best quality of the game. You have complete control to customize almost every aspect of the game to your liking. Change the color of almost everything you can use, and develop your own emblem to be shown on flags and shoulders. And the game features my favorite weapon customization type, akin to Army of Two, you can mix and match barrels and stocks of all your guns and create entirely new ones in the process. Making the assortment of weapons in the game essentially multiply.\n\nThe F.O.B.-The online Forward Operating Base was a great idea on paper before release, but it is a rather large disappointment for many in the game, a lot of people just choose to ignore it. Once you do infiltrate once, you almost already have done it all. It almost makes you a nanny, taking you out of intense missions to make you defend your base against someone like me, who invades just to take all your resources, pummels you with explosives and waltzes to the command room.  This aspect of online I’m sure will be shadowed by the coming Metal Gear Online which I hope is grand.\n\nStoryline-It is with this that I may be the most unsatisfied. Simply put, it does not live up to the quality of Metal Gear. The fans looked forward for the first steps of Big Boss’ plunge into villainy, they wanted to see the beginnings of The Terrible Children, and they wanted to see hatred and revenge… I don’t see any of those things delivered. The trailers for the game were almost a lie, manipulating scenes in almost all the cut scenes to make you think something completely different about them. It’s not something I feel that I can approve of. We are given areas of the game for choices to be made that impact nothing, only lead to the exact same ends defeating the purpose of their existence.\n\nFor what seems no reason “Too be continued” is put in the middle of cut scenes, breaking the immersion to bring you back to the mission selection screen for you to press next mission and continue anyway immediately. Movies and shows do this break not because they want to, but because they have to for time slots, and in an industry that is trying way too hard to become another, instead of forging its own path, this game is the definition of attempts at that. Do not mistake me for saying that movies and games shouldn’t mix and “Metal Gear shouldn’t be like a movie,” I am saying that it shouldn’t have to bring over the bad qualities of them to do so. The sad truth is the one damned place we should have gotten the “Too be continued” was at the end of the game because it ends so abruptly, I was barely aware it ended. The game has a plethora of gutted content that haunt the fans. It’s what happens when a game as big as Metal Gear comes out in days where this is becoming more and more okay for developers to give us unfinished games.\n\nMETAPHORS AND THEIR EFFECTS ON GAMEPLAY-Kojima had a lot of messages to deliver with this game. I think that it might be the first ever example of a game that features such heavy metaphors that it encumbers the gameplay, removing the fun from it. If you kill, snake will be covered in blood, but if you kill too much he will be covered permanently too look like a demon. The player is now punished to play with low resolution red blotches covering their body as they extract helpless animals out of their habitat to the middle of the ocean to get “Nice” point. If I wanted to play Fable, I would play Fable.\n\nIt is the metaphors that lead to the most questioned aspect of the game. I will try to continue without spoiling anything. At the shortened finale of the game, we lose a beloved asset to the gameplay. A favorited aspect of the game is removed for the sole purpose of being beaten over the head by a metaphor, into submission. It is the prime example of the will for powerful metaphors hindering fun, and for a game designer I misunderstand how this is a good choice. Petitions are already in place for the changing of this, and a mod is most likely right around the corner. There already is one, but it is a little complicated and isn’t a solid answer yet.\n\nTL;DR\n\n\nSo in conclusion, I am merely saying what most others are saying online, the game is a disappointment to the fans of the series, but the gameplay is truly rock solid. It is still a great game to be played, but it is barely a Metal Gear. In my personal, biased, eyes the series should have ended and did end at Guns of the Patriots. This game was a move to copy the gameplay of Peace Walker with more action and deliver it on a massive AAAA scale. But the sad truth is, not many fans enjoyed Peace Walker, and in such, not many are approving of this game. I know I am making blanket statements, and you may have enjoyed Peace Walker and this game too, however take a trip online and see the big picture. I’m not going to be your big brother and point you to answers online, but don’t do so unless you beat the game, spoilers are everywhere. As a fan, I dislike this SEQUEL.\n\n\nThanks for reading, share your thoughts!","September 9, 2015","false","442.5"," 27 of 51 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","27","51","0","0"

Sorry wrong phrasing there, what I meant to say was your own tactical OU. The chance to deploy troops on regional operations, manage tech/RD, recruit POW's, infilitrate enemy encampments on solo ops, infiltrate FOB's, charge into FOB's/enemy encampments, travel to regional locations with varying degrees of flexibility in your approach to an objective and well, everything operating your own tactical OU entails pretty much. There are far more things to be done and to do. Being 'Boss' ain't easy and requires a lot of input, but you have an entire MB to support you in that regard. A growing MB at that.\n\nSo if you ever dreamed of managing your own tactical OU with the guise of being this legendary Warrior (the greatest Warrior of the 21st Century mind you) and operating all this from your laptop then hell, this game is for you soldier. Think Jagged Alliance 2 but a little more involved I'd say....Bet you'd never see that comparison coming.\n\nNow get your laptop online and connect to your TCO and prepare to engage and infiltrate FOB's of opposing PMC's. Oh and let's not forget to help out Big Boss eh? Afterall we are the guys that provide Mother Base, Big Boss and all his tactical units full coverage and support via our laptops/PC's. Feel's good to be an NCO (Senior NCO at that) and work alongside Big Boss himself even though we do not deploy to the field personally, we ensure operations are controlled to the smallest detail (quite literally I'm sure you would all agree).\n\nSo how would I rate managing my own tactical OU? Well I don't. I only do what is needed to be done and carry out order's as is expected of a soldier and I expect you all to do the same.\n\n(I thought Witcher 3 was a generational MasterPiece. It seems there is yet anouther game that must be added to the list of Generational Masterpieces. Hell Big Boss may be the greatest Warrior of the 21st Century, but Kojima's game is defintely one of the greatest game's of this Generation.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xSoupCan/recommended/287700/","xSoupCan","Palpurntin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xSoupCan/","302 products in account","I felt I had to NOT reccomend this game. It's got the same Ground Zeros problem in that had so much potential. In this case the potential wasn't allowed time to develop. Judging this game right out the gates seems to have been a mistake, as later developments show the plot/story to have ended far too abruptly. I spent 72 hours playing a game I could've beat in 10. Wait for a price drop as it really will just end being another open world 100% completion game.\nDon't confuse this with me disliking/hating the game, as I certainly don't. I'm sort of sad really, because this was a Game of the Year game until you factor in the plot.\n\nIf you're a diehard MGS fan and just have to play it, then fine. But don't preach about the game being a perfect masterpiece and other such rot. It truly is not. It had the chance to be.\n\n\n\nOriginal Review (Still relevant)\nGreat game undoubtedly, but that doesn't mean I don't have a few petty nitpicks.\n\nIt took a little over an hour until I finally got to actually play the game and shoot something. And then there were more cutscenes.\n\nWell it's a mixed (good and poor) port, which isn't really a nitpick. But i'm surprised on how varied it is.\n\nThe Bad (of this port):\n-Control scheme is setup for a controller.\nButton prompts will show analog sticks instead of mouse movement when appropiate, and you are forced to check your key assignments page for the majority of actions (excluding CQC). The "Controls" tab shows you an XBOX controller command layout.\n-I think this could run better\nTo be fair, the game runs and looks great. But I have an i7-3790K @ 4.2 GHz and a GTX 970, I should be able to max this game out. I'm currently running it with medium - high settings with some settings completely disabled (VSync is off, of course) patched\n-You can lock your frame rate to 30, but not anything else\nAt least it doesn't crash your game if you turn it off *cough* ARKHAM KNIGHT *cough*\n-The majority of settings are strange\nFor example, you have a wide range of graphical settings; which is good.\nBUT\nYOU CANNOT CHANGE SOUND VOLUME OF THE GAME WHILE IN GAME; which is bad.\n-Enemies/Yourself can see through walls\nIt's very random and usually occurs with objects (Sandbags, shipping containers, tents, etc.) But just as that headline says: Enemies can see and shoot you through walls. And while i'm sure you could shoot back (I didn't try that), I can analyze enemies through these certain walls (requires clear view of the face). It's very random as to what objects are technically not there, as well as who can see through them. Such a strange bug\n\nThe Good (of this port):\n+Borderless fullscreen\nI was really surprised by this, but you can safely alt+tab from this game without fear of fatal crashing. And the game will still run with no performance loss out of focus.\n-Further testing revealed that only the taskbar and windows task manager will show over the game however, everything else will remain 'under' the game. So.... Patched\n+Stable\nNot a single crash or suspect frame rate drop, with long play sessions\n+Wide range of options\nThere are a load of Graphics settings to set for this game, which is genuinely surprising for a port\n\nIn conclusion: There's room for improvement, but i'm happy with what we got.\n\nBeat the game, plot-wise this game is a complete mess. Most of which to do with Konami ♥♥♥♥ing over Kojima and friends. The simple reality is that this game is unfinished.","September 1, 2015","false","93.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The gameplay is decent and it's the only redeeming factor although such repetitive missions/side missions can't be excused, there isn't much variety at all in the 150 side missions they are basically a rinse and repeat scenario, only 15 of the 50 'main' missions actually move the plot forward. At least Keifer Sutherland pulls through he really does nail those 8 lines he had to speak.\n\nIm scratching my head wondering how this took over 6 years to develop,it's enjoyable but laughably overhyped there was clearly development issues in that time perhaps Konami and Kojima should have spent less time marketing it and instead producing a better game. I loved this series but i can't reccommend a game that was falsely marketed, has cut content and literally slaps you in the face with the horrible second chapter and recycled missions. Mgs5 is completely incomplete, should have called it The Phantom Story.\n\n- The pacing.\n- The plot.\n- Mute Snake.\n- The ending.\n- The cut content.\n- The repetitive missions.\n- Worst bosses in the series.\n- The time to get from MB -> ACC -> Mission.\n- The spoiler credits at the beginning of each mission.\n- Pointless side-ops.\n- Quiet is terribly written, but what part isnt.\n\nAll of these and more make for an average game, the first in the series i won't replay.\nFinal score: 6/10","September 3, 2015","false","106.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Don't buy it on steam thought, £46 is far to expensive when you can get it on other well known sites for a fraction of the cost and activate it via steam.\n\nSo the game?\n\nThis is definately a game that focuses on story and cinematics. There's about 30 mins to an hour of cutscenes and mundane gameplay before you get into the free roaming missions part of the game.  That's not bad, the opening intros set the scene and are very gripping, but having just played through the METAL GEAR SOLID V: GROUND ZEROES, I was itching to get into the action and did find the intro a little too long for my taste.  I was also slightly confuded. You're made to change your character's appearance which you do via a 'mirror'. Then later you're shown your face again and it's snake, and you continue to play with Snakes face so I've no idea what that was all about..... #confused.\n\nOnce past that though, the action / stealth is great fun. It's nothing that's not been done before mind you with splinter cell coming to mind, but tied up with the beautiful graphics, its well worth playing.\n\nUnfortunately for me, I'd forgotten that the previous MGS's were heavily 'super natrual' themed and coming from Ground Zero, I was expecting a traditional military sneak em up like Splinter Cell. All these wierd things like flaming man, floating straightjacket woman and the zombie like soldiers kinda broke the immersion for me, but I accept that's my fault for not reading the synopsis before buying.\n\nThat said, it's a minor gripe, one I can get over quck enough by just going wit the flow.\n\nFinally I should mention the controls.  I've read a lot of the negative reviews and many are focusing on the controls.  Keyboard controls are fine. Sure they take a little getting used to but if you're a PC gamer at heart, you should have no problems adapting.  Yes, it is a 'head shake' moment when you pull up the key map and find it shows you controller diagram, but oh well!\n\nSo in short, the game has some minor issues (what game doesn't?) but nothing that should stop you buying this.\n\nEnjoy!","September 2, 2015","true","27.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

That right there is enough for me to give a positive review.\n\nAs for the game itself, I find the gameplay to be a bit lackluster so far. The controls and mechanics are not very intuitive. A jump button and some simple climbing mechanics would have made the navigation far less awkward than it is now.\n\nThe real star of this game are the cutscenes, as they are simply the best in-engine cutscenes I have ever seen.

Other than that though the customer service is responsive in my experience and they seem to be constantly working on the online experience and maintenence is I think three times a week which is decent. The way snake manipulates the environment around him is wonderful and it completely immerses you in the story. The autosave feature saves headaches if you mess up and the camera control is polished and easy to manipulate if you want to shoot off the left or right shoulders, duck and peek over cover, slide down slowly while looking behind you, etc.. The story is definitely a solid point in the series and it doesn't disappoint here either; I was on the edge of my office chair the entire time during the prologue and I already have to many questions than answers meaning I will be 100% marathon gaming this whenever I have game time. Once they throw you into your sandbox you can do whatever and see what happensl they don't really tell you what to do so its all up to you how you take down a base. The combat is open and free and you can do whatever you want given your tools and environment. The reflex from MGS GZ is back and it still works wonders if your spotted.

It isn't for the light hearted. Those unfamiliar it is not a held guide along a beautiful path, but a mouintain path frought with peril above some of the most treachourous of lands.\n\nBUT\n\nit is a road worth walking, for both the unseen & the veterans.\n\nWHY?\nthe history and depth alone should merit this, but alone it does not. Alone it is but a fragment of what could be the understatment of the year. The rich depth behind every character goes a long way, the smaller references invite multiple fascitudes of story and enlighten worldy players of their backstory. Inevitably each moment is both profound for old and enlightening for new.\n\nIt provides multiple types of gameplay, using open world mechanics, inside a mission driven structure, using strong Ai & consistent character development to make each play a strong willed push into the unknown. Each mission is thought out as to approach it anyway YOU choose. Are you the sniper that likes to hit and leave? would you prefer to CQC yourself some enemies and get some new recruits? or just going for that masterfullly stealthy assassin play and get in and out unseen...or go in guns blazing. Ultimatetly the decision is yours. This is why it makes a massterful game.\n\nHOW?\nThe game gives sense of purpose to every slight connetation it has. From subtle story elements to overly dramatic crazy gunfights with enemies that look as though they've been forged by a love of anime and giger alike. Ultimately the purpose behind each story element and every mechanic has weight. Nothing feels like a poor attempt, nothing feel's floaty,  nothing belittels itself after 10 hours or more. Each mechanic in game, from hold up's to the careful use of stealth to infiltrate has had minor tweaks from other games, further development & weight added.\n\nThis feels more like a culmination of the series, gathering all the quirks and problems and eviscerating them entirely. Giving HUGE plot point's and dialog pieces enough space to breathe, but enough screen time as not to bore those who just want some action.\n\nTHAT GOOD?\nIn a word YES\nIn many YES but, we have a game here that achieves so much it would be silly to belittle the smaller pieces of game that bare no weight or have trivialites, these have been put in becasue of the fan's love for the series, hideo kojima's masterpiece is here. His being in game's has spiralled to this point. Whether we see more from him in this light is uncertain, but what is certain is that this is his pinnacle currently.\n\nIt would be a shame for anyone to miss out.","September 2, 2015","true","19.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

What makes them think clicking my left mouse button means I want to click the "highlighted" element on the screen I don't know.\n\nGetting past the menu issues by restricting myself to arrow keys, the space bar, and escape button I began to be able to enjoy the game for what it was. Except they were constantly popping up controller-based icons trying to instruct me how to do things. I gave in and plugged in my xbox one controller and ever since I've enjoyed the game thoroughly without compromise.\n\nDoes this make it a console port? Yes and No. The game is not plagued by any sort of performance issues expected from a console port. In fact it runs smoothly at 60fps with occasional hitching when I'm travelling too fast or I've been playing too long.

Still, I've never seen the FPS dip below 40 and I have the settings all set to the highest they will go at 1080p.\n\nThis is an excellent game. The cinimetography is amazing. I haven't seen an offensive self-casting shadow yet. It is movie quality stuff here. I think the hair leaves something to be desired, especially the facial hair which looks very coarse on my PC. I think they tone down the graphics to reach 60FPS regardless.","September 1, 2015","true","150.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","5"

That right there is enough for me to give a positive review.\n\nAs for the game itself, I find the gameplay to be a bit lackluster so far. The controls and mechanics are not very intuitive. A jump button and some simple climbing mechanics would have made the navigation far less awkward than it is now.\n\nThe real star of this game are the cutscenes, as they are simply the best in-engine cutscenes I have ever seen.

Other than that though the customer service is responsive in my experience and they seem to be constantly working on the online experience and maintenence is I think three times a week which is decent. The way snake manipulates the environment around him is wonderful and it completely immerses you in the story. The autosave feature saves headaches if you mess up and the camera control is polished and easy to manipulate if you want to shoot off the left or right shoulders, duck and peek over cover, slide down slowly while looking behind you, etc.. The story is definitely a solid point in the series and it doesn't disappoint here either; I was on the edge of my office chair the entire time during the prologue and I already have to many questions than answers meaning I will be 100% marathon gaming this whenever I have game time. Once they throw you into your sandbox you can do whatever and see what happensl they don't really tell you what to do so its all up to you how you take down a base. The combat is open and free and you can do whatever you want given your tools and environment. The reflex from MGS GZ is back and it still works wonders if your spotted.

Yes\nWorth a buy at full price? Yes\n\nOverall a great game for old and new mgs fans alike, but don't expect the same story telling and the same long, artful cutscenes that you've been accustomed to: this game is more focused on gameplay, and the story is quite gimped compared to the other games in the series.\n\nPros:\n+Great introduction\n+Great TPS gameplay\n+Vehicles\n+Many customizations\n+Great deal of ways to approach any given mission\n+Buddies to bring into battle\n+Many hours of content\n+Open world\n+Difficult (if you avoid killing and reflex mode)\n+Great graphics\n+Awesome optimization (all high+extra high on GTX660 1080p@60fps)\n\nCons:\n-Gimped story when compared to other MGS titles\n-Reflex mode makes the game a joke for stealth\n-Forced multiplayer\n-Microtransactions\n-Slow, timed development of in-game items (similar to upgrading structures in clash of clans)\n-Bare, empty world\n-Weak boss fights\n-Some missions are repeated exactly with only a few extra challenges added to them\n\nConclusion:\nIf you don't care for story and don't come from an MGS background, and like great graphics and gameplay, then this game is worth your money and time, and will be fun for you to play. If you were hoping for a great finale to the MGS series, you may be a little disappointed. All in all, a good buy, but definitely not "10/10" as IGN seems to put it. I'd say its more like an 9/10 for gameplay, and 7/10 for story.\n\nEDIT: Now that Metal Gear Online has come out on PC, there's even more reason to purchase this game. I can comfortably say that the online mode was well worth the wait, and will be enjoyable to existing players of the game. Though it does have a few quirks here and there (such as a lack of push to talk and text chat for in game comms) it is still a very enjoyable experience. It is also NOT pay to win, as MB tokens are only for puchasing cosmetic items.\n\nScore: 9/10\nWorth a buy at full price?

I think david would have done a much better job, as iv seen him in interviews and seen his love for the franchise. kiefer sutherland, although is voice is good, does not do the character justice at all. its as if they paid him per word or something. this is my only gripe with the game. it is truely amazing.\n\nTHIS IS WHERE I WISH THERE WAS A "MAYBE" OPTION\n\nThe fact that there is this terrible FOB thing is very very annoying. you MUST have an FOB in order to continue with research for new weapons and alike, however once this is set up, other people online can raid your facilities and steal your stuff. this is fine for people that want to grief people but people that want to just deal with the story mode are constantly having other people raid their things and steal the resources we collect. I HATE THIS. why is there no offline option?! i am not interested in raiding other people, so why should they be allowed to steal all my resources? this is incredibly annoying.\n\nI have since changed my review to a thumbs down. the reason? i have spent a lot of time on this game playing almost exclusively single player. I go on holiday for a week only to come back to find more than half of my resources gone due to people raiding me. whats worse is this has pretty much made me lose interest in the game as in order to progress with research and stuff i need those resources and im not interested in farming for the next 10 hours. ill probably never finish this game now.\n\nUPDATE\n\nIt's been around 6 months since i touched this game. I signed in to see if anything had changed and i instantly get that horrible beeping sound telling me i have been invaded once again.... still no option to disable FOB invasions.\n\nwill never finish. uninstalled.","September 2, 2015","false","93.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Gameplay is excellent and the story has its moments. People are complaining about the Chapter 2 feeling rushed and honestly, it kinda is. However, if you are going for 1€ per 1 hour of entertainment value, you are pretty likely to fill that quota in chapter 1 alone, so yeah.\n\nPeople also complain about the online FOBs. Other people can infiltrate your motherbase and steal your staff and resources even when you are offline. But does it really matter? I have now played the game for quite a few hours and I have been invaded quite a few times and... I have never lost anything meaningful. Biggest loss has probably been an A++ staff member. So what? You can get 10 new ones in 5 minutes. It literally doesn't matter, if you play the game. You can even lock-up your staff members (I can lock-up >100 members, the amount seems to increase when you develop your base), so they can't be stolen or killed by your rivals. I have pretty much all my >S rank staff locked-up. I have nothing to lose in FOB.\n\nAnd if you do happen to be online, it's payday baby. The attacker really has no way to win against you and when you succesfully defend your base you get pretty nice rewards from it. When you are offline, people from your friend-list can go defend your base. And they often do for the rewards. Overall, it's not a bad system. It actually sparks up the end-game quite nicely.","September 17, 2015","true","251.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The number of Vehicles and the freedom of customizations both need to be extended and improved in any somehow.\n\n2. Kinds of soldiers depending on the suit they wear are just few but facially looking different from each others, there are 2 kinds of soldiers you can extract, Africans, Russians. They speak different languages and some of them the same, for example: African: speaks English, kikongo (the epidemic disease lol), Wears the same as other African soldiers. Needs more weapon classified soldiers!\n\n3. Entrances: Well, I can't find any huge enemy building base to sneak into like in mgs 2. Everything's like small rooms and buildings without even doors.\n\nBonus: I wish hideo kojima could remake the metal gear solid 1, 2, 3 series all into one for PC and put them up for sale like what CAPCOM did with resident evil series.","May 11","true","388.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But with the very many debates and arguments for or against this game for whatever reason, I thought that I'd write my own idea about it here.\n\nSo i'll start with a little bit of background. MGSV was the first MGS game i played and after I beat it I went and (I think) played all of the main canon MGS games except for 4, including 1, 2, 3, Portable Ops, and Peace Walker. (I played Revengeance too but thats kind of different). I'm currently working on being able to play 4 and, by what you can probably see by my profile picture and all the stuff on my profile, I'm a pretty big MGS nerd.\n\nWith the whole idea of the Metal Gear Solid stories and ideas in my head, I am well aware that this game is very very different from the rest of them in many more ways than one. However there will be no "♥♥♥♥ konami" related things in this because honestly I didn't see much of a reason to care for the differences. I see that MGSV was not a game most people expected and now that i've played the rest, I wouldnt've expected it either. It's incredibly different and unfinished at that, theres literally an entire zone of the game missing, but with what we have here I still feel like it's one of the best next gen experiences for video games right now.\n\nEven though it's unfinished, I actually did enjoy the story. It was different from others but I really did like it. The whole idea of revenge and the parasites seemed really cool to me and I wish they ended up finishing it. (Being vague cause spoilers). It's extremely intense too. I really wish I could re-experience the opening of the game for the first time again because of how much was going on, it was insane and it left me genuinly scared a few times. As well as a mission later in the game where you basically watch Snake make a huge choice with rules he had set within his own army as well as his own morals, leaving him broken at the end of the mission. Being vague again.. but lets just say I had a hard time actually getting through the mission, not because of difficulty but just how i felt about it.\n\nIm not much of a graphics person but graphically the game looks amazing and even better if you mod it a little bit. I downloaded some shaders that made the game look even nice in my opinion and gave me an actual reason to use night vision in the game. Thought i'd get that out of the way real quick\n\nNow the gameplay is really what sold this game out to me. It's so fun and i'm going to try to be as brief as possible about it. It's free roam, and honestly one of the best free roam games out there right now. It gives you a bunch of freedom with exploration as well as freedom on how you want to do things. You can stealth, you can be loud, you can be lethal, you can knock people out. All basic stealth game esc stuff right? Indeed but, it adds so much more to that aspect. You can get a horse to use as faster transportation if you dont have a car and dont want to run, and you can shoot people on top of it, or hang off the side of it to hide from people as your horse rides past them. You can get a dog, use it to scope out enemies around you, kill those enemies, and of course you can pet it. Theres also so many takedown/melee based stuff you can do too, like chain together a line of people and body slam them all into the ground, pick one up, and throw him at the guy in the distance knocking them both unconscious. You can use a cardboard box as a sled, and to impersonate another guard or use it as some sort of distraction. I could go on for hours about the gameplay and freedom with the game but theres a ton of things that I still haven't even figured out yet. Even with the amount of hours I have clocked into this game.\n\nOverall this game is amazing and my current favorite. I feel like I still didn't scratch the surface with the things you can do in this game but the game is so worth it to me that you should just go try it yourself.\n\nSince ratings are a thing people do I might as well do it as well. 9/10\n\n","May 22","true","228.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dylanai/recommended/287700/","dylanai","Luminaire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dylanai/","500 products in account","I'll preface this by stating that this review is coming from a lifelong fan of the Metal Gear Solid series (though I'm not quite old enough for the original Metal Gear games) and have played every entry in it thus far.\n\nPositive:\nThe most well-optimized PC game I have ever played. This runs on maximum settings at a steady, high frame rate, and in my near 200 hours of playing it, never once has it stuttered, dropped in frame rate (at least not noticeably), or had a single screen tear. Also, one of the best looking games I've ever laid my eyes on. Transitions from gameplay to cutscenes are seamless.\n\nClean, intuitive interface and controls. Whether you're on foot, horseback, or riding in a mech, everything is fluid and precise. I don't think I've ever accidentally done something I didn't mean to in terms of character control. The stealth gameplay is very well executed and the enemy AI is generally good despite a hiccup here and there.\n\nVariety is the name of the game. You can approach any given scenario pretty much however you want. Charging in guns blazing will almost always get you killed until you reach a certain level and unlock more powerful weapons, but that's an option. Want to steal a tank and ride it into battle? That's an option. Command your horse to defecate (“Do it!”) on the road to cause enemy vehicles to swerve out of control? That's an option. If you have, say, enemy communication satellites to destroy, you can go tactical by sneaking in at night in a stealth suit with a silenced tranquilizer pistol and planting C4 to detonate from a distance, remaining undetected. You can also choose to destroy the satellites with a rocket or grenade launcher or ride in on a mech and use its customizable on-board weapons or never even leave your helicopter, simply fly above the site and mow down enemies and the satellites using its mounted minigun. Veterans of the series will be happy to know that the cardboard box also makes a return, and now you can distract enemies by taping posters of female models on the side of it or use it to slide down hilly areas for up to hundreds of feet. The game's world is a big playground, and simply wandering around in it aimlessly can be surprisingly satisfying.\n\nThere is a section in which you “develop” new weapons and gadgets by using the game's fictional currency. You will need to raise certain sections of your army to specific levels to unlock some weapons (more on the army aspect later) as well as go hunting for soldiers and resources in the field. This gives you a more customizable experience, as you choose what weapons to unlock and when. You'll want a decent weapon in each category, but if you're more of a close quarters gunman, you can concentrate on upgrading the shotguns or SMGs first; likewise, if you prefer fighting at a distance, there are sniper & assault rifles and launchers aplenty.\n\nYou find cassette tapes littered all over the place, many of them pop songs from the '80s (including David Bowie, The Cure, and Joy Division), which gives the game even more of a sense of period and setting. Plus it's just amazing to hear A-Ha's “Take On Me” while interrogating an enemy, pushing a knife through his chest, then opening fire on a squad of child labor profiteers.\nNegative:\nRepetition. There are over 150 side ops, but they're almost entirely comprised of groups of missions in which you do the exact same thing (extract a hostage, destroy an artillery unit or communications outpost, clear a minefield), only in different places. Some main missions, though longer and more complex, are guilty of this too, and there are too few that truly progress the plot.\n\nThere are only two maps – Soviet-occupied Afghanistan (all desert) and civil war-torn central Africa (mostly marshlands and some forests). Neither contain enough interior settings (which is where Metal Gear Solid thrives, I feel), and while they are large, a lot of it looks the same and it won't take very long before you've explored both maps in their entirety. Mother Base repeats so many textures and designs that it isn't worth exploring beyond looking at your animal conservatory (featuring animals you've trapped in the field) or gathering various collectibles hidden around. This combined with the redundant nature of the missions adds to the sense of repetition in MGSV.\n\nHideo Kojima. To me, he's like the George Lucas of videogames – Metal Gear Solid is one of the best games ever made and MGS3 is arguably the best game in the series, but story-wise, everything else is eccentric & wacky at best and randomly silly & stupid at worst, and there's nobody to tell him no, save Konami (and only after he cost them too much money). MGSV is rife with plot holes, including a gaping one due to budget cuts that prevented Kojima's team from finishing the final mission which would've brought closure to all the storylines left hanging open and properly tied the game into the chronology of the series, leading into Metal Gear 1. Also, at the beginning and end of every mission, Kojima reminds us that this is his game in the form of cinematic credits which accentuate his company and status. He even makes a cameo in the game as himself *again* (he did this in the exact same context in Ground Zeroes). The game may as well be called Hideo Kojima's Metal Gear Solid V.\nNeutral:\nThe story and particularly the ending which naturally polarized players. I thought this game had some great moments but that they were too far and few in between. It has noticeably shorter and fewer cutscenes than previous MGS games, which, depending on the player, can be good or bad.\n\nThe RPG-esque micromanagement that comes in the form of leveling up Mother Base (“Outer Heaven” from Metal Gear 1 & 2 and your home when you're not gallivanting around Afghanistan and Africa). As you extract more soldiers and resources from the field, you'll start to build more platforms and an army to train and house on them, each soldier having a specialty, rating, and, in some cases, a temperament label (some soldiers lie about their true skill or are a negative influence on the squad while others have various positive combat skills). Some may find this fun and a nice distraction from the action while others may find it unnecessary or excessive. You can choose to ignore it to a certain extent, but you will need to level up specific squads in order to unlock some important upgrades.\n\nThe difficulty in some missions can be downright brutal, and it doesn't help that the checkpoint system is unforgiving. Boss fights (of which there are much fewer than in previous MGS titles) will start you over entirely if you die, and you can lose a lot of time in missions if you get very far but are spotted and killed. There's no manual save, quicksave, or auto-save of any kind when you're in a mission. You need to be smart, tactical, and patient and not treat this like a typical shooter or 3rd person action game if you're going to survive, especially early on.\n\nThis has very little in common with previous games in the series, including the demo/preview game, MGSV: Ground Zeroes. 95% of it is spent outdoors, it's much lighter overall on plot and dialogue, and the nature of its stealth gameplay has changed dramatically by setting it almost entirely outdoors as opposed to the corridor-style settings native to the series.\nVerdict:\n\nThough its problems are glaring, they don't detract from the overall experience, which is practically distilled fun. I would recommend this to both fans of the series and those new to it as well. It's one of the best action/adventure games of this generation, though not the best game in the series (in my opinion, that would be MGS3: Snake Eater). It's also unique as stealth games go because of how the those aspects operate in an open world setting.","June 5","true","190.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Some main missions, though longer and more complex, are guilty of this too, and there are too few that truly progress the plot.\n\nThere are only two maps – Soviet-occupied Afghanistan (all desert) and civil war-torn central Africa (mostly marshlands and some forests). Neither contain enough interior settings (which is where Metal Gear Solid thrives, I feel), and while they are large, a lot of it looks the same and it won't take very long before you've explored both maps in their entirety. Mother Base repeats so many textures and designs that it isn't worth exploring beyond looking at your animal conservatory (featuring animals you've trapped in the field) or gathering various collectibles hidden around. This combined with the redundant nature of the missions adds to the sense of repetition in MGSV.\n\nHideo Kojima. To me, he's like the George Lucas of videogames – Metal Gear Solid is one of the best games ever made and MGS3 is arguably the best game in the series, but story-wise, everything else is eccentric & wacky at best and randomly silly & stupid at worst, and there's nobody to tell him no, save Konami (and only after he cost them too much money). MGSV is rife with plot holes, including a gaping one due to budget cuts that prevented Kojima's team from finishing the final mission which would've brought closure to all the storylines left hanging open and properly tied the game into the chronology of the series, leading into Metal Gear 1. Also, at the beginning and end of every mission, Kojima reminds us that this is his game in the form of cinematic credits which accentuate his company and status. He even makes a cameo in the game as himself *again* (he did this in the exact same context in Ground Zeroes). The game may as well be called Hideo Kojima's Metal Gear Solid V.\nNeutral:\nThe story and particularly the ending which naturally polarized players. I thought this game had some great moments but that they were too far and few in between. It has noticeably shorter and fewer cutscenes than previous MGS games, which, depending on the player, can be good or bad.\n\nThe RPG-esque micromanagement that comes in the form of leveling up Mother Base (“Outer Heaven” from Metal Gear 1 & 2 and your home when you're not gallivanting around Afghanistan and Africa). As you extract more soldiers and resources from the field, you'll start to build more platforms and an army to train and house on them, each soldier having a specialty, rating, and, in some cases, a temperament label (some soldiers lie about their true skill or are a negative influence on the squad while others have various positive combat skills). Some may find this fun and a nice distraction from the action while others may find it unnecessary or excessive. You can choose to ignore it to a certain extent, but you will need to level up specific squads in order to unlock some important upgrades.\n\nThe difficulty in some missions can be downright brutal, and it doesn't help that the checkpoint system is unforgiving. Boss fights (of which there are much fewer than in previous MGS titles) will start you over entirely if you die, and you can lose a lot of time in missions if you get very far but are spotted and killed. There's no manual save, quicksave, or auto-save of any kind when you're in a mission. You need to be smart, tactical, and patient and not treat this like a typical shooter or 3rd person action game if you're going to survive, especially early on.\n\nThis has very little in common with previous games in the series, including the demo/preview game, MGSV: Ground Zeroes. 95% of it is spent outdoors, it's much lighter overall on plot and dialogue, and the nature of its stealth gameplay has changed dramatically by setting it almost entirely outdoors as opposed to the corridor-style settings native to the series.\nVerdict:\n\nThough its problems are glaring, they don't detract from the overall experience, which is practically distilled fun. I would recommend this to both fans of the series and those new to it as well. It's one of the best action/adventure games of this generation, though not the best game in the series (in my opinion, that would be MGS3: Snake Eater). It's also unique as stealth games go because of how the those aspects operate in an open world setting.","June 5","true","190.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

I am surprised the game runs really good at release date. I havnt really plyed much of the game and I just finished the prolouge. Lol I am stil at the beginning of the game, but running around a bit during the prolouge the game was running really good. The only major issue I found is the controls. I cant use my mouse throughout the main manuw, which is very annoying. All u can do is press left click to select, but have to us ekeyboard to go to taht specific selected thing in the manue and right click to go back. Of course you can just use the keyboard to do almost all those things, but it doesnt feel right without the mouse working correctly. My mouse works for practically every game that I have played in my steam library over 100 games. I can still play the game using the mouse, it works fine, but the mouse controls doesnt show up during tutorial, well mainly moving around control, it insteads shows the contoller icon to move. Its confusing, but definately playable if you understand the basics of any game and use that knoldge in this game.\nAlso one mor eproblem that I have noticed was the first time I lanche dthe game. Well after I downloaded from steam and installed it, it crashed immideately. But after the second launch it seems to be working. I am not sure why that happned. But since the game works fine I am ok except about the controls being like the way I described it above.\nOther than that, I havnt noticed any othe rissues with the game, seems really good and solid. I run everything on max settings and it runs really good. Well so far I give it a 9/10, I would have given it a 10/10 so far, but the control problem made me decrease it by 1, so its a 9/10.\n\nThis is my current rig:\nI got my PC from HP.

As a long time fan of the MG series (I read the Worlds of Power book as a kid if that's an indicator) - this game is wonderful.  I won't go in to details, might write a full review after the game is finished but that is still a long way off after 20+ hours.\n\nSome thoughts quickly though: The gameplay is varied to a very satisfying degree and feels polished in all areas, you have tons of options in how you approach missions/scenarios, the game feels very immersive, great voice acting, cassette tapes are actually very entertaining to listen to with great information.  Troy Baker sounds a bit too much like Joel here, but that is just a personal complaint, he is becoming my new Steve Blum in that when he plays a role, I can only hear the Voice Actor himself instead of the character.\n\nSo far the PC port has been near-flawless for me (I have an issue with the "emblem creator" but it is not hindering my enjoying of the game)\nThe game itself maintains a steady 60fps at the highest settings and I have had no other issues.  I use a PS4 Controller with DS4Windows.  I'm impressed with the quality of this PC version - also it has been patched a couple times since release already (today is 9/3) which is a good thing.\n\nOverall I'm really quite impressed with this game so far and I know things are only going to get more intense in the story, I can't wait.","September 3, 2015","true","35.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
