The same group that made Recettear An Item Shop's Tale. It was translated and brought to Steam by Carpe Fulgur in 2011.\n\nIn this game you play a little anime girl with her fairy sidekick sister. You adventure through dungeons, defeating enemies with sword and magic attacks. Of course this reminds you of Zelda and it plays a bit like one. It focuses much more on combat though, akin to a Ys-type of game. The game features a blend of 2D sprites in a 3D world, which works surprisingly well. I had some issues with aiming in the beginning, but that worked itself out after a while.\n\nThe magic system is the central part of the gameplay. You use different colored gems to cast fire, water, wind and earth spells. These gems are used in the order you pick them up from the ground, but when you hold the cast button longer you use up to three gems at once. This way various different colored gems can be combined and produce different spells. This make for quite the deep system and keeps the combat interesting. ♥♥♥♥ earth though. Those gems are worthless.\n\nThere are no levels, so you only improve through your items. This makes the game faster and removes the grind you have in typical JRPGs. Upon death a Game Over screen pops up, but you just respawn at the town, which makes dying forgiving. That is needed though, because you will die a lot.\n\nI actually had a lot of fun with the story, especially the characters. I don't know if it is thanks to the translation or source, but there are some really funny lines in there. I recommend this game, if you like some oldschool dungeoning.","September 23, 2014","true","1.7"," 104 of 113 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","104","113","0","0"

Characters are really enjoyable and cute, the gameplay is challenging, story is entertaining. Honestly I'm a big dope for cute things and rpg games, it reminds me of the orcarina of time but with 2d characters in a 3d environment. I hope I helped! DANK\n\nI have to say, I've been playing this and I keep coming back for more. A review below me says "it's aged a little" so what? Does that mean story and gameplay isnt fun anymore? Seriously I grow to love the characters, gameplay, and story more and more every min. I dub this an instant classic for me. The developers other games are also very fun and enjoyable as well. Please support this game. Like i said, the only flaw is the controls, but really get a gamepad its well worth it for other games as well. It's like what, 10 bucks out your pocket for something useful for many other games, don't over look this incredibly fun and enjoyable game, it is well worth 10 dollars.\n\nMy control scheme is (xbox controller) a to jump, right trigger to attack, x to target, left trigger for magic and of course the joysticks are camera and movement. DOUBLE DDANK\n\nI got up to the final boss, I'm not sure what the producers were thinking... Seems I have to 'level' a bunch to beat it from what other people are saying, but I have a lot of hours down... Hmm.. I strike this as a problem since the only way to really level your character would be to buy things and hp, I believe there should have been a few different ways to upgrade the hitpoints. Getting money is a little slow also so eh, unless there is another way that I'm not seeing, but oh well I play my way.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shiosan/recommended/70420/","shiosan","Shiosan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shiosan/","48 products in account","Reminds me a one of the Japanese action RPG from PS1. We don't see this often enough, and that's a shame.\n\nNow, indeed this game is bit hard to control if you are not use to it, but you can map it from game folder. Go to local game folder, open Steam\Steamapps\common\Chantelise and you can configure the control from there.\n\nI used this mapping- ←→↑↓for movement, A for attack, S for Jump, D for dash, F for lock-on, left Shift and space for camera angle. Trust me, this works like charm.\n\nNow on to the game. I loved it. I beat it, and I still play it from time to time. Stroyline isn't much deep and straight forward, but it's charming and easy to play. English translation is bit cheesy though- I played it on Japanese because... I am. It's almost like a mixture of Xenogears, Mario, and Zelda. Fun beat'em up, less puzzle.\nOnly downside that I can think about is that the dungeon is very simple and only one-way direction. All you have to do is to defeat all enemies and unlock the gate, rinse and repeat. The boss battle is more fun. You have to figureout the pattern of the movement, and find the weakpoint. This part tends to be more like Zelda.\nYou will also unlock few more things, like having magic on your sword. Charge attack will release the magic with several different ability, and I thought that was fun.\n\nAnyway, I would recommend this game, especially if you like doujin games. You won't be dissappointed.","November 2, 2014","true","13.4"," 42 of 49 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","42","49","0","0"

It was released in Japan 2006 and was localized in 2011, with the more popular game, Recettear: An Item shop Tale, by the translation company, Crape Fulgur.\n\nIn a nutshell: the game is an action RPG with some magic thrown into the mix. There are times where the game can be a little unforgiving. Stay calm, reflect on what happened, and try again.\n\nControls: Simple. Attack, jump, dash(Attack + jump), lock-on, and magic. The longer you hold down the back button, the more gems you use. Everything is explained in the tutorial. I recommend using a controller. If you don't have one, don't worry, the game has full kayboard controls. Though you might have a slightly harder time getting use to the controls. The config allows you to map your own buttons. If you really want to, you can play with a steering wheel.\n\nPlot: It's a witch hunt. Everything is explained in the introduction.\n\nReview: It's a cute anime RPG with an enjoyable story. The artwork throughout the game is wonderful. If you've played Recettear, you'll recognise quite a number of textured used.\n\nThe game may be a bit difficult to get the hang of. You've got a small health bar and the enemies hit hard. For some, the 2D sprites in a 3D environment may seem confusing to judge hitboxes. You'll spend quite some time getting use to the controls and enemy movements. The magic system works in reverse order; the last gem picked up will be the first gem consumed. Play around with magic; different magic combinations have varying  results. The first gem above Chante is the main gem, and the gems around Elise feet are the support gems. It's confusing at first.\n\nTreasure can be sold to purchase health boosts and equipment. However the prices double every purchase, directing players to get better at the game or farm for a ridiculously long time in order to farm enough pix(money) to afford the next item.\n\nAs the story unfolds, you'll have access to more magic and equipment slots. You'll also encounter tougher enemies that have more health and hit harder. Learning to avoid damage early will help along your adventure. Every boss has a unique feel to them. Well... unless you count mutual hatred. When the game gets tough, and you feel like an area is far too difficult to handle currently, take a breather, and take it slow. Going in wth a clear mind helps with observing your opponents movements. There is one hidden treasure in each room / area of the dungeon. Something to reward explorers.\n\nLets wrap this up: The game is challenging and you need to get good. If you're someone who gets easily frustrated at failure then this game may not be for you.\n\nTips:      Save often.\nTime Attack DOES NOT progress the stroy. It is a good way to practice.\nObserve your opponents. Avoiding damage is a good thing.\nLearn from your mistakes, and gear up accordingly.\nUse magic to help clear areas or deal with tough enemies. Super Armour reduces damage and prevents damage knockback.\nHidden Treasure may help along your travels. Try asking the monk in town.Try not to spoil the game by looking at a guide unless you really get stuck.\n\nAs for why I have an absurdly high playtime on record: I have my reasons.","December 28, 2015","true","342.2"," 30 of 32 people (94%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","94","30","32","4","2"

It teaches you your limits of tolerance for certain flaws (e.g. bad graphics, questionable textures, odd monsters you may have seen recycled from/also featuring in Recettear) and scales these grievances nicely from 0 to Chantelise Camera Angles.\n\nIt's the kind of game you install, play with the determined mindset that you *will* like it, find you simply can't after an hour, then uninstall.

I played the hell out of it for like three weeks straight and then gave up on it cold turkey.  Then, I attempted to play it again and it's like Steam reset my hours.  Anyway, I finally beat Chantelise, so I can write my review for it.\n\nI'm going to cut through most of the rhetoric ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that I post in my other reviews and come out and drop any pretense of trying to contain myself:\n\nThis ♥♥♥♥ is hard.  It's like, Dark Souls hard.  It's like the cartoony anime version of a sick hell.  To put it in perspective, when I reviewed Fortune Summoners, there were times where I wanted to throw my controller across the room because it was hard, and Chantelise makes that game look like Hello Kitty Island Adventures.\n\nThe game starts off easy enough:  You control Elise, flowing through fields, dodging, slicing up slimes, collecting money.  Easy and fun.  Then you go to your first dungeon.  Not too bad, not too bad.  Then you go to the next room, and you die.  Then you try again, and die, and again, and die, and die, and die and die.  THEN, you finally get through the first dungeon and you're like "Well that must not be too bad..."\n\nAnd then you die again and again until death becomes a hilarious release.  I found myself intentionally dying on PURPOSE sometimes because I just knew, "Whelp, I don't have enough health to beat the next room, might as well die and start over."  Yeah, it's that bad.\n\nIn fact, there are no words that I can properly use to explain the difficulty of the final boss.  I remember spending about 5+ hours with the cat statue grinding so much money to buy as many of those stupid vitamin waters just to boost my HP by a fraction, just to make that fight easier and it STILL sucked beyond all comprehension...which thus lead me to ultimately put the game down and walk away from it for nearly a year.\n\nSo, I went back and tried again - what the hell was I thinking?  I mean seriously?  Oh well, time to fire up the 1980's grind sound track and get to work.  About 100,000 PIX and several 'treasure hunting adventures' I was finally ready to beat the game.  Too bad the boss didn't agree.  I did it, but man..It'll give me nightmares.  You get the idea.\n\nThat being said, I do want to caution anyone thinking of purchasing Chantelise, *especially* if you've already played Recettear:\n\nThis is a *very* recycled game..  The enemies, some of the graphics, the sounds, it's the same as Recettear.  Actually, it seems like they probably made this game first, so Recettear is the one recycling, but that game is more fun and more successful, so I am going to try and think the other direction (even though I know it's probably incorrect).\n\nAt the end of the day, if you like a challenge (no really, I mean A CHALLENGE) and you see Chantelise on sale, it's a pretty fun and interesting 3D action oriented JRPG.  Voices and art are cute.  Bring a stress ball though, you'll need it.","April 29","true","5.2"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","94","16","17","6","1"

Lots of people call it an RPG, but that's simply because it's Japanese. It's a hack and slash through and through.  Maybe not worth the $10 price tag, but worth a playthrough if you can get the Fulgar collection on sale.\n\n+ Very challenging.  I'd like to say it's 70% good design, and 30% poor design.  The good design stems from the different ways you have to approach different enemies and how to handle them when they're attacking from all around.\n+ Graphics are charming, although lackluster.  It's a 3D game with 3D bosses and 2D items, characters, and enemies that always face the screen.  Graphics are reminiscent of Doom's 2.5D rendering, if that makes more sense.  The pixel art is nice, character illustrations are generic anime caricatures which don't insult the eye too much.\n+ A fishing minigame exists for those of you who want a Japanese game with lots of grind.  I never bothered with it.\n+ Lots of secrets in each level.\n\n- Maybe too challenging, and not in a good way.  As I said before, the challenge is 30% poor design; that stems from ♥♥♥♥♥♥ magic stone mechanics, poor hitboxes that stem from having 2D sprites represent 3D characters, and no immunity after getting stunned, meaning a boss can basically one-hit you if you get hit by some unavoidable attacks.\n- The magic stones aren't implemented very well.\nIt works like this:  There are 4 kinds of stones and 6 slots.  You can use one stone, two stones, three stones, or four stones at a time for obviously more powerful attacks if you use more stones.  However, you're locked out of the higher-tier powerups if you pick up a random permutation of stones - you can't use two blue stones and one green stone to heal, for example, you'll just end up firing the two-blue-stone attack while wasting a green stone.  This can be frustrating when battling an enemy since the button to pick up stones happens to be the same one you use to attack, meaning you can ♥♥♥♥ yourself over with stones when you need to heal.\nIf you want to drop stones, you hold the cast magic button for five seconds.  It's a pain in the ♥♥♥ and not viable when you're in a tight spot.\nAlso, stone drops are random every time you hit an enemy.  This means that you have to rely on the RNG to give you a good set of stones, especially when you're fighting a boss and you desperately need blue stones to heal.\n- The music is so ♥♥♥♥ing horrendous.  I played the kazoo version of Armstrong's boss theme from the MGR soundtrack during the final boss's final form and it was actually better than the in-game music.\n- The story sucks and the final boss is anticlimatic.  For ♥♥♥♥'s sake, you don't even SEE the witch, let alone fight her.\n\nDespite its flaws, it's a fun game if you're man enough to be the little girl.","June 25, 2015","true","12.2"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","15","18","0","0"

First off: I loved it. Great game from beginning to end.\n\nMusic: Great soundtrack. The opening theme and the credits music were probaly my favorites.\n\nGameplay: The gameplay (in terms of combat) consists of three important parts: melee attacks, dodging, and the magic system. The melee attacks have one button with varying damage and the occasional critical hit. Dodging is done by pressing the jump button and attack button at the same time. It is crucial that you git good at this. And the magic is definitely where it shines. The magic works by collecting gems dropped by enemies and combining them to activate spells. The obvious spells the game tells you about all include using a certain amount of the same gem, but I found a few other combinations one if which was a lasting poison effect. I of course forgot how to do this really fast.\n\nControls: The game begs to be played with a gamepad. Use one, or else. I didn't even touch the keyboard controls.\n\nStory/characters: A big part of why I loved the game. I enjoyed it throughly and loved the characters. It is well written and has some serious moments mixed in with a good sense of humor. The story is shared in the visual novel style with sections of dialougue and Japanese voice acting accompanied by character portraits and the occasional cut scene as well image. If you don't like reading then learn Japanese. Or just don't play it. I wouldn't suggest that though.\n\nFlaws: It suffers from the same issue that all RPGs do: The Grind. You WILL need to grind. Of course this is expected when it comes to RPGs, but a heads up those of you who can't stand it. Also you may lose the will to continue. This game has been compared to Dark Souls in terms of difficulty. In fact some say it's harder. I have never played Dark Souls, but I can tell you that if I didn't love the game so much I would have given up. There were many points when I just hit a wall, but my drive to win, win, WIN kept me grinding and improving. There is a luck component though because gem drops are completely random and you can't use the ones you pick in any order you want either. You have to use them in the order you picked them up.\n\nSo all in all, if you love RPGs and have a playlist of motivational Shia Labeouf videos you'll find this game Gr8 m8 8/8.","July 27, 2015","true","22.4"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","12","14","2","0"

The graphics are nice and use both 2d sprites and 3d models. If you've played Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale you will see some familiar items(under different names).\n\nI had no problem with the controls, although navigating the gap jumps in later levels took some time with a keyboard. To progress through the level stages you must defeat every monster in the area to unlock the exit. If you have beaten the stage and die it will still be unlocked up to that point you died when you rush back through a level.\nAs for the plot- it was interesting and kept me playing when the grinding for gold got old. Did I mention you have to grind? A lot? When you kill enemies the power in their blood can crystalize from your sisters' fairy dust, dropping a gem you can use as a magic attack ( the amount you can combine increases with game progression to a total of 4). You can combine the effects of gems to deal massive damage to enemies with that inherent weakness (though doesn't really apply to anything but large creatures and bosses). Other things that can drop are your standard metal currencies (ranging from copper to gold) or an item of no use, but value for resale at a shop.\n\nThere are, however, few shops in the game, but you are highly dependent on them if you would like to progress easily and faster. When you buy something from a shop the purchace price of that item goes up and stays that way regardless if you resell. Your character has item slots where you can equip specific items of various worth. If you want to do more magic damage with literally no defense no one is stopping you.. except the limited item slots. There are 4 item slots in total and the only way to unlock them is to progress through the story. As I said before you can equip anything equipable item you like in these or none at all, but there is a catch. If you go full magical power with no defense and decide "Why spend all that money on health upgrades?" you had better be a good dodger, because there is one thing in this game that is too horriffying to deal with...\n\nWhen you get somewhere below 50% health you'll start to hear a high pitch incessant beeping to indicate that you are in fact dying. It does not stop until you get above that 1% difference of dying and not dying. You will innevitably die though and may have to run through a level a couple times to figure what you're dealing with boss wise. That noise will become the reason you do not want to lose health and the motivation to strive to complete the level. If you like the mystical soundtrack you might be encouraged to keep the game unmuted and hope, to whatever the hell you may pray to, you don't get below that threshold.\nIf you do get below you cannot easly heal yourself by the process of attacking things alone. You can gain health from food items randomly dropped by monsters and found in crates/barrels or through a specific gem combination that I won't mention(cruel right?). I have to say though I didn't figure out I could heal with a gem combination(though you cannot use the combination till later in the game hint hint) untill the last level and the face palms were plenty that day.\n\nAll in all an interesting game and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys grinding with plot on the side. It feels amazing to plan things out and rush through the levels- dodging monsters that dot the map, and finally reach that boss room you've been trying to clear for the last half hour. Side strafe, and take down all that appose you.","April 13, 2014","true","16.2"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","15","21","0","0"

For instance, while the game utilizes a 3d perspective, it all feels very clunky and disorienting when the charcter model is 2d and moves in a 2d way. It has that sort of early PS1 feel to it which puts me off. Carpe Fulgur seemed to grasp that this would work better in a 2d top-down perspective like in Recettear and bam, they made a superior game.\nThe combat is not as varied as in Recettear either. You control the same person throughout the story attacking with the same three-hit melee combo. There also is a magic function which depends on the crystal pickups you got from enemies, but it all feels very stiff since you have to cast it in the exact order you pick up, giving you little choice between what spells you would use.\nI wish I liked this game. I wish I did, but it has too many shortcomings in the combat system and tries to combat it with a 3d perspective that feels lacking in comparison to today's visuals.","June 24, 2014","false","3.5"," 40 of 69 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","40","69","0","0"

So why am I recommending it?\n\nWell, beyond the charming art style for the characters and the low price of the game, there's something endearing to me about a game that knows its limitations and doesn't try to overstep them. Unfold an engrossing story across many chapters that is cute, amusing, and at times even upsetting. There are lots of thematic similarities to Recettear, and fans of that game will find a lot to enjoy here.\n\nThe English localization by Carpe Fulgur is very well done and translates the original Japanese game faithfully and naturally, and the game runs fine even on the most pathetic hardware available today. Gamepad and mouse/keyboard are both acceptable, although I'd actually recommend skipping the gamepad for this game as it makes no use of analog input (it plays great on an SNES pad, for example.)\n\nThe only warnings I'd give about this game are the grueling difficulty at first (don't give up!), the somewhat grindy nature of the progression, and the relatively short length.

So you end up playing "just one more" level. And to me, that is a sign of a good game. The story is catchy - and setting and characters aren't bad either. Art style is pretty. The music fits the game nicely, though otherwise the sounds are not that spectacular.\n\nIn my opinion, the difficulty level was ok. It starts rather easy and keeps getting harder as you progress. As you advance further in the story you must adapt to different situations. Another thing I liked about this game is that there are different ways to "build" your character, using different equipment and skills in different levels.\n\nOnly thing that really bugged me was the camera. Maybe I just didn't know how to control it properly, but the camera controls were awkward at times.\n\nThe translation from Japanese to English seems pretty good. At least I didn't spot any situations where dialogues would have been weird or illogical. Although there is very little voice acting, those have been kept in Japanese, which is a good thing in my opinion.\n\nAll in all, "Chantelise - A Tale of Two Sisters" is a fun game. Even after you finish the game there is still stuff to do! Also, if you have played "Recettear - An Item Shop's Tale", there is a lot familiar stuff for you to encounter, although the game itself is quite different.","July 5, 2014","true","14.9"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/toad004/recommended/70420/","toad004","toad_004","http://steamcommunity.com/id/toad004/","199 products in account","By far, the best part of this game is the story. This game has very endearing and hilarious characters,  and extremely well written dialogue. Most modern games with their GPU melting graphics and 9 figure budget are incapable of the basic entertaining story of Chantelise.  The game opens by explaining that Chante has been turned into a fairy against her will, and she needs her sister Elise to help find a way to remove the curse. You're always looking out for the next time the game will allow you to read the next few lines of dialogue.\n\nThe problem here is that this is a video game, meaning you actually have to PLAY it. Ugh.\n\nDon't get me wrong - I'm the kind of person who expects an epic story in every game I play. I'm the one in a million who actually ENJOYS cut-scenes. For me, gameplay always takes a backseat to story and characters.\n\nBut the gameplay in this title is sickeningly loathsome. It feels like an alpha version of Ocarina of time. It's meant to be an action game, but the controls feel so stiff, and it is very easy to get attacked by an enemy or fall off a ledge because you couldn't see it. Generation 5 camera at its finest. Going through dungeons is a chore - and there are no puzzles, mini-games, or anything else to break the monotony.  To progress to the next room in a dungeon, you must kill ALL the monsters. Miss one? Wander around the over-sized rooms looking for it, only to finally kill it so you can enter the next room AND DO THE SAME THING OVER AGAIN.\n\nAs for actually fighting these monsters, you can walk up to them and whack them with your sword. When they die, they often drop money (which can be used in town to buy items) or gems. These gems are used for spells - ex: red for fire. But you'd think you could save up gems and plan to use the right spells on the right monsters. Nope, you cast spells based on which gem you picked up last.  The game is set up in such a way that some spells are VERY useful or useless against the right or wrong monster, but you have no way of saving a spell for the right monster.\n\nMany other reviewers seem to believe this game is hard. No, this game is easy if you pay attention. The problem is the combat is so freaking BORING that there is no way you CAN pay attention. I have played many games where the story is the main draw, and the gameplay is there only to serve as a medium for the plot and characters. But Chantelise is below even that - the battle system is an OBSTACLE, actively preventing you from getting to the next part of the plot (with yet another room filled with generic monsters).\n\nThe awful gameplay of this title 'bottlenecks' the fantastic story.","December 10, 2013","false","2.6"," 21 of 37 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","21","37","0","0"

You basically take on the role of a girl who needs to clear out regions and fight a final boss in a region. The story progresses after you finish a region and its boss and it seems like it was a well designed game, for the time when it came out. The gameplay itself is actually pretty fun and is generally smooth for the most part and the game is fun. I will highlight some key points, both good and bad, below.\n\nMy first point is with the keyboard optimization. Frankly, it is not too great. A and S are camera rotation, Up, Down, Left, Right are move, and Z,X,C,V are your abilities. It takes a while for you to get used to this scheme and there is not even an option to rebind the keys the way you want it to be. Furthremore,the bad part is how punishing the game is if you screw up your keys, especially if fighting a boss. That brings me to my second point.\n\nMy second point is that the game is really hard. The first few places and the tutorial were relatively easy so I was like okay thats fine. Then I died. I thought I died because I was being a little uncareful and that I was. But then I died again. And again. And again. And then I finally got to the boss for the first region. Let's just say that I died at least 10 times to that boss alone. Although I am not against games being hard, with the poor keyboard optimization, the game becomes relatively annoying when you die cuz you mispressed a key or was pressing D when you should have been pressing S (because typically with camera controls on keyboard without mouse optimization it is WASD with A being left and D being right).\n\nMy third point is that the game is simple to get into and understand. The controls and stuff, although not optimized well, are actually really simple to master and there are only a few combinations to be remembered with the spells. You have your basic attack, your jump and attack, your dodge, and your magic. Combine that all with lockdown and remove lockdown and you get a really simple control scheme which is actualyl really nice. The enemies are also self explanatory sometimes. To hit a flying enemy you have to jump attack. Each enemy has a health bar. Each enemy has an attack pattern. All your standard stuff but Chantelise does it pretty well.\n\nOverall, good game but a little on the older side with poor optimization for PC. If I could have played this game with a mouse controlling the camera, it would have been a lot easier and better. But the game itself is fun and I would reocmmend this.\n\nRating: 7.3/10\nRecommend: Under $3","May 1","true","5.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","4","5","2","0"

Can't give it a full endorsement since it's rather poor in spots, but at the same time I liked it enough to finish and do some extra stuff in it.  Honestly, most of your enjoyment in this game will come down to how you like Carpe Fulgar's adaptation.  If you liked how Recettear and Fortune Summoners read, you're in for more of the same and will have more fun with Chantelise.\n\nThe gameplay on the other hand is not so hot.  Chantelise is a 3D dungeon-diving game with bland graphics, repetitive enemies, and some truly annoying audio (ugh, that low health indicator).  As the game progresses, you can mix and match pick-ups for more diverse spells, but they're just kind of blah on the whole, both idea-wise and visually.  Melee is also just kind of there and is incredibly simplistic.\n\nOne cool feature about the set-up of the game (go to dungeon, run through some floors and then fight boss) is that each floor has a hidden item that you can grab by completing some type of unique goal.  I'd suggest just looking up the in-game hint in a guide and then figuring it out yourself rather than deal with how the game gives out clues, as you lose some of your max hp to acquire them.  Some of the stuff you have to do to get the hidden treasure is pretty cool and shows a development team that cared about trying to make their game fun but just weren't up to snuff to do so.\n\nThe dungeons themselves aren't anything special, either design or art-wise.  You do have to run a dungeon all the way from floor 1 to the boss floor to beat it, though after reaching a floor, you can choose to practice on it from the map, which is useful for getting ready for boss fights.\n\nTechnically, far from a great game, or even a a particularly good one for that matter, but the adaptation and looking for some of the hidden treasures did enough for me to enjoy my time with this game.  I'd only fully recommend it to people that enjoyed the other adaptations Carpe Fulgur did or big-time fans of dungeon-running games.","June 28, 2014","true","11.8"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

Much to my surprise, not everything is cheerful under the hood of this story and an otherwise easy game is regularly [refreshingly] broke up by challenging boss battles, of which the LAST boss takes the cake and serves as the absolute challenge in every way.

I will start with what the game has to offer along with what I liked about it before I get to the issues of this game.\nStory:\nThe game takes place around a tale of a witch who curses anyone that is outside on a night with the red moon. Shortly after you hear 2 sisters going outside on such a night, they then pass out only to find out that the older sister has become a fairy when they awaken. Thus they set out on a journey to find out if there is a way to reverse the curse. It’s a simple yet engaging story with a nice little twist later on that escalates their situation and that there was a reason behind the sisters getting cursed.\nGameplay:\nAs mentioned earlier this game feels very like the Dark Souls series, this means that each stage is going to be rather difficult and very unforgiving. Each stage has you exploring a certain dungeon that is split into serval different areas to make navigation easier. When you first enter an area you must defeat all enemies in there before you can proceed, enemies will drop magic gems that you can pick up and use to cast various spells as well as gold that is used to buy equipment. As you progress each area will have more relentless swarms of enemies to tackle, couple that with the fact that there are very few methods to recover your health along with each death forcing you to restart the stage from the beginning and you got a recipe for tough and unforgiving game. But it does not feel like it’s just out there to make you suffer. The concept of the game is very easy to grasp but is not a cakewalk making rather fun and having you feel more compelled to complete the stage after each death.\nMusic:\nMusic in this game is definitely above average. From the soothing tracks of the first few areas leading to the dungeon entrances to the creepy yet upbeat tunes when exploring the dungeon itself. They all sound refreshing and set you in the proper mood for the situation the character is facing. Of course that not to say it’s the best as it still can’t compare to music composed by Nobuo Uematsu or Michiru Yamane.\nFlaws of the game:\nThough this game has a great concept it certainly has its own issues. Firstly camera control in this game works against the player, you have your standard rotate left and right button but when trying to reset the camera it rotates slowly back to the default position which feel very clunky and brings you out of the fun combat as you will always walk to a corner to reset your camera to get a good angle. Grinding in this game is also a little vexing, as you will die a lot the only way to counter it is to grind to get better stats but there are no level up in this game instead it is replaced by gold which you will use to buy better equipment, now this would not be an issue if there weren’t so few equipment slots. This makes it so you can never be fully prepared for a dungeon as you will never have enough equipment slots to get your stats to the right number, high on armour and attack? Just let a fireball chunk you for 25% of your hp. Also since you will be grinding a lot the music will start to feel repetitive and you will eventually be like “this music is killing me” past a certain point. Lastly, though Chantelise has a good story it is rather predictable and a little anti climatic, if you watch anime or read manga the story of Chantelise will feel very familiar to you.\nOverall Chantelise is a punishing yet fun action adventure game that fans of rogue-like games and Dark Souls would likely enjoy. Though it is difficult and has clunky camera controls, the game doesn’t feel very unfair and you will get past each stage with enough patience and perseverance.\n\nTL; DR: If you like challenging games with a good story Chantelise is just for you, just don’t be surprised if the bad camera controls messes you up.\n","May 26, 2015","true","9.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TormakSaber/recommended/70420/","TormakSaber","[LUE] TormakSaber","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TormakSaber/","509 products in account","A short and difficult dungeon romper, with no inbuilt character progression. Rather, all character progression comes from finding and buying equipment in the world. This means if you're having trouble, you're grinding money instead of experience. I didn't have to grind much except at the beginning, before I got better at reading the bosses and their patterns. Once I got the game's skillset down, I had to grind very very little, and was beating the game simply with the things I found, while using the money I collected to buy HP boosts. Protip: Only buy HP boosts, that's the only thing you need to buy.\n\nThe story is cute and whimsical, and actually pretty interesting. The gameplay is simplistic, and I would compare it to a very simple Legend of Zelda. A single attack combo, and various combos of magic spells that can be cast based on magic stones you pick up. While you can't choose the order in which you use stones directly, there's so many stones around that it's very easy to simply collect stones in the order of the spell you want to cast.\n\nThe game is long enough to hold your interest and short enough to not wear out its welcome. The music is passable, the characters are expressive in txt and voice, and the overall presentation of the game is decent enough. Reccetear is better,  but Chantelise manages to hold its own.\n\nA soft recommendation for people who enjoy the art style and can handle a somewhat difficult (until you learn the controls and spell combos) game.","June 2","true","7.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The magic system is ... not good, but the camera dials it all the way up to unplayable.\n\nMaybe this is more familiar to console gamers, but as a PC gamer who rarely uses his gamepad holy oh my god, this camera is horrifically horribly terribly uselessly awful. When combined with the very short draw distance (enemies fade into sight when you're almost on top of them) it's rather obvious why they gave Recettear a fixed camera.\n\nRecettear can be difficult, and is very grindey and samey. But at least the camera isn't its worst enemy.\n\nFor anyone who's unclear - all text in the game is in English, the spoken dialog is the original Japanese audio, with subtitles. I haven't played much of it, but I haven't hit any spots where any spoken dialog is not subtitled, as can often be seen in such games. Even the little bits of flavor speech (like Chante announcing the spell she's casting) have little subtitle bubbles for them.","May 30, 2014","false","0.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","1"

It never gets better, but you adjust to the suck and don't notice it much after this. It's mostly caused by how difficult it usually is for developers to have 2D sprites move fluidly through a 3D environment. It is a very notable flaw though.\n\nThe combat system is a bit limited, and most of it's depth is hidden behind mechanics the game never explains: such as equipping the special crystal items to change how your weapon interacts with the world, and the elemental affinity of enemies, which is sometimes difficult to discern at a glance. Enemy variety isn't the best, with there being perhaps 9 different enemies for the entire game, but you get just enough variety that it takes a bit to get bored. The lack of depth to combat makes the tedium of how quickly you die more of a cause for frustration than it otherwise would be.\n\nYou will need to use a guide, as the Secret treasures of each level can be difficult to locate due to requiring very specific things, like trying to fish during a bossfight, or killing a very specific enemy before you kill anything else. These treasures are gamechanging: in one case giving you access to lifesteal, which is crucial for surviving the final boss without too much tedium.\n\nThe magic system is very entertaining, but the inability to select which order you use your spells in ultimately reflects poorly on it in the end. I don't recommend purchasing this game unless it is bundled with Recettear, or on a very steep sale price.","January 26, 2015","false","22.0"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

The game itself has a leveling system, though there are no skill trees, stats are applied automatically, and you gain more magic at predetermined parts of the game.\n\nThe game features an interesting magic system. As you hack away at enemies, magic stones will come flying out of them. Picking up magic stones allows you to use spells based on the element of the last stone you picked up, and you can hold up to a certain amount. If you continue to hold to magic button, more stones will be used to cast the spell and change what the spell will do.\n\nThere is funny dialouge, a story as good as Recettear, fun gameplay, and pretty graphics.

I saw it was from the makers of An Item shop's tale, which I recently played a demo from, and I liked it a lot. Chantelise is a fun game, and fairly easy once you get a hang of the controls, which was a pain in the ♥♥♥ to get used to. The bad things about this game, I think, are the controls (and no option to change them), the annoying sound you hear when you slash enemies, and that you have to turn the camera yourself (again, with annoying controls), which takes ages to get right, you can't move around really quickly that way.

So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game.\n\nOne Hour Reviews #33 - Chantelise\n\nNormally I have a soft spot for JRPGs, but in the case of Chantelise, I could not get into this game at all.  I didn't even finish my hour of play before I put it down.\n\nI'll start with the presentation.  It's this weird hybrid of a world presented in 3D, but all of the characters are flat 2D sprites.  It's not so bad with your character since the camera stays behind you as you move.  But NPCs look really weird as you circle around them.  Each character has 4 different sprites that get displayed based on which side of the character you are facing.  I have nothing at all against the 'retro' look in games, but this combination of 3D and 2D I found jarring.\n\nThe biggest part of the game is the combat.  Combat in Chantelise is not turn based, but rather plays more like a hack-n-slash game.  There's really only 2 basic elements to combat.  One is mashing the melee attack button, and the other is your magic button.  Magic works rather strangely in this game, as you pick up gems from the ground.  Rather than selecting a spell you cast, you use these gems in the order they are picked up.  You can hold down the magic button to charge your attack and use multiple gems.  It sounds nice in the sense that different colored gems can be combined for different attacks, but it's entirely dependent on the order you pick the gems up.  So your strategy is more about trying to pick up gems in the right order, while trying not to get killed, which you'll fail at miserably because the game becomes punishingly difficult as soon as you enter the first dungeon.\n\nThe story, what little I saw of it, I did like.  The characters were my favorite part of the game, but unfortunately the game just kind of doles out the story in little pieces, like a visual novel, in between clearing out areas of monsters.  Which brings up another annoyance I had.  When you enter a new area, you will be blocked from progressing by some magical barrier or whatever it is that the game doesn't explain.  The barrier just magically goes away when you kill the last monster in the area.  No explanation, that's just how things roll.\n\nOne other note, there is no level progression in the game, which means the only way that you can become more effective in combat is to buy better items.  When you die, you get sent back to town.  So it sets up this grind of collect gold, get killed, then upgrade to better items.  Having some grinding in a game isn't a bad thing, but it has to be fun, and I wasn't having any.  This game just isn't for me.","August 15, 2015","false","0.5"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lexcelsior76/recommended/70420/","Lexcelsior76","Lexcelsior","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lexcelsior76/","56 products in account","I do not recommend this game, because it is quite difficult and repetitive.  The price of failure is too high.\n\nIt's a 3D action role-playing game, so make sure your dexterity is up.  That is fine, and I like that.  It plays somewhat like Dark Cloud for PlayStation 2.  I highly recommend a controller, but watch out for Tic-Tac-'Doh:  select (which I mapped to A/X) is attack, and cancel (for me, B/circle) is jump.  My fingers are either confused during combat or during shopping.  This seems to be common in Japanese role-playing games, though, so I may as well get used to it.\n\nHere is a quick summary of the pros and cons.\n\n+ If Elise (the younger, human sister) dies, you respawn at the (nearest?) town.  All of your items are intact.\n+ You start with some guidance on combat tactics and maneuvers.\n\n- My main complaint is that my character's abilities rarely change as the game goes on.  I advance the story and better items appear in the store.\n- If Elise dies, however, you must run through all of the areas you previously cleared in order to advance the story.\n- It is easy to fall from ledges.  Some slopes (of a fallen tree trunk, for example) seem passable, but are not.\n- It took me a while to figure out that in order to leave an area, I had to defeat all monsters therein.\n- Enemies sometimes drop treasure, but each time you sell a piece of treasure, the resale value of all future items of that type keeps decreasing.  This makes grinding (repeatedly fighting enemies for cash) less and less fruitful.\n- Concordantly, every time you purchase a piece of equipment, the price of all future items of that type continuously and sharply increases.  The first glove may cost 2000, but the second one of the same type may then cost 5000.\n\nIf you want an action JRPG, I highly recommend Fortune Summoners instead.  It may be 2D, but the character development is much better paced with the story.","January 7, 2015","false","4.6"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Revolves around tedious and clunky combat. It's worth repeating: boring as a barrel of stale bread. The characters appear to be as flat and interesting as cardboard, and the story -- though the intro makes it seem intriguing! -- soon reveals itself to be just as flimsy. Or so it would seem. The combat is way too boring to slog through, so I'm not bothering to find out if the story or its characters get any better later on. The entire game is clunky, and a lot of the art and design choices are laughable or cringe-worthy. I was expecting the immediate wit and charm of other Carpe Fulgur titles, but I didn't find it here. There were some cute caterpillars that tried to kill me, but that's the only good thing I can say about this game.\n\nSo obviously it's not my sort of game, buuuut you might like it if you are interested in replicating the (admittedly sometimes magical and bizarrely entertaining) experience of playing a bargain bin PS1 title, and/or you really really REALLY like hack-and-slashers so much that it doesn't matter how tedious or one-dimensional that hack-and-slashing might be.\n\n"there were some cute caterpillars" 1/10","November 26, 2014","false","0.4"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

I thoroughly enjoy this game in spite of some flaws in the animation. Maybe that's because my criterion for a good game is that it should challenge my reasoning skills. This game definitely does that!\n\n\nAlthough "Chantelise" is rated "6 years and older" in terms of content (from the G-rated movie), it's a difficult game that might frustrate some children, and will definitely challenge adults. It has five "worlds" with 3 levels each (that's 15 levels in all). So far, I've only gotten to Level 4 (where the Bird gobbles me up every time!) Each time I play, however, I discover new tricks and features that I missed before.\n\n\nThe real trick in this game is not bashing badongo's at breakneck speed, it's figuring out the best order to collect the various items. True, Elise's Red Berries are very hard to aim and you need several throws to do much good. They're meant to be that way, because they're his least powerful weapon. But find that green Homing Berry, and your aiming problems are solved, because it follows the target like a smart bomb! Also, I didn't find Chante's harvester on Level 1 until I had played for several hours -- but once I did, my whole strategy changed the next time around. And I'm sure it will change again, once I find whatever it is I need to get past that darned Bird!\n\nI give this game a 0/10 though, because its gaaaay af.","November 5, 2014","false","2.0"," 3 of 23 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","3","23","0","0"

I pulled it up, started playing, and by the first level I was immediately enthralled. The combat is simple but not TOO simple, there's enough thought put into it that you can't just mindlessly slash your way through this game, and you have to strategise your pickups. This game is very difficult - don't let the adorable characters and music drop your guard, it took me 7 tries to finally beat the 2nd boss, and 2 to beat the first! I have died several times on the levels leading up to the boss just due to the amount of stuff going on - this game feels like a PERFECT blend of shoot 'em up and brawler, because not only are you brawling and shooting, but you're always on your toes and dodging a constant barrage of spells being thrown by the enemies, meanwhile melee monsters like skeletons and... catapillars are giving it their all, this game is RELENTLESS.\n\nand I love it. If you see this game on sale for 5$, it's (in my opinion) and instant buy, and for 10 - there should only be a few moments of consideration.\n\nas for flaws, I don't see any. it plays decently enough on the keyboard, and I guess my mind just clicked with the camera controls (a common complaint) because I've had few problems with the camera after the first few minutes, but overall it works.","January 10, 2015","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not recommended - 4/10\n\nFirst off, I dislike how this game is made. Chantelise uses 2D sprites that move around in a 3D world. This totally lowers the appeal of the graphics. Furthermore, it makes this game impossible to play without a controller.\n\nAlthough I like the twist and the plot of the story, it is not long enough to make it enjoyable.\n\nThe gameplay is quite neat, but at the same time, boring. Player has limited choice of actions, and are further limited depending on what monster or enemy boss we face. After several game overs and replays, you will get the perfect strategy for each boss, and that's it.","February 1, 2015","false","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Years later I found it on multiple websites and platforms such as STEAM and quickly all my memories of the game came rushing back and I knew I had to have it again. Holiday Sale 2014 rolls around and here Carpe Fulgur has their entire collection on sale which was a no brainer for me to buy at such a great deal.\n\nTL;DR\n\nBuy this game full price or bundled or discounted, you won't be disappointed. It's a quick paced hack and slash with a small but useful amount of magical spells to use and a number of NPC's/Towns to visit as well. The translation which I assume is spot on is well written, charming and makes it all that more enjoyable.","January 5, 2015","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I bought this game by thinking it carries the dungeon runs of "Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale" to another dimension of fun. I was right about the dimension but were wrong about the fun. In Chantelise, instead of going for a dungeon-run-for-fun you have to grind your way out because you have "no other choice". You have to grasp controls, items and enemy weakness to certain spells. Every action game requires you to do that but at some points Chantelise falls, on the flawed side of the mirror. I've never seen an action game where you perform dodging move by pressing attack, jump and direction at the same time.  As for spell system, spells they're pretty limited and bound to chance more than your own skill and memorization. Lock on system is slow and it's a giant impact. Also there's a fairy over your shoulder  trying to give tips like an idiot. I don't recommend this game. Go waste your money on something else, Chantelise needs some polishing.","August 20, 2011","false","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

One was turned into a fairy because neither one had a sense of restraint against jewels, and so they go to find a way to turn her back.  Then they find out that it's a huge cycle that some evil overlord plays out repeatedly, and that in order to seal him away they have to use up all of the fairy-sister's fairy dust - which will in turn kill her.\n\nThe gameplay in this is really good, even given the linear environment - the combat system plays like a cross between Legend of Zelda and Monster Hunter.  Each zone in each stage has a bonus item you can get by doing a specific action (you WILL want to use a walkthrough for this, otherwise you'll have very little help in figuring it out), and the spell system is just simplistic enough to get familiar with it fairly quickly.  The story turns dark halfway through, but the ending makes up for it handily (until the last few sentences, which pretty much shoot your closure in the face).\n\nSimple, colorful, fun and playable.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vapourslave/recommended/70420/","Vapourslave","Comsmic Garbage","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vapourslave/","119 products in account","As an unapologetic weaboo, Chantelise occupies the sort of niche that many others would gloss over. I picked A Tale of Two Sisters up a while back in a sale mostly on cutsey looks alone, and was pleasently surprised.\n\nTo air my only grievence, the visuals to this game are  DIRE ; 2D sprites in a blocky 3D environment cause countless ♥♥♥♥-ups that make it very hard to figure out which enemy is doing what, and how close things actually are. This is dealt with somewhat by a nifty lock on system that will provide a tad of familiarity to Dark Souls veterans: using it you can dodge and counter with simple mele combos - hit the things enough and they die.\n\nSome enemies, however, are only vulnerable to certain kinds of magic, which is an interesting mechanic in-and-of-itself: Enemies in Chantelise drop crystals which you pick up. Each crystal corresponds to an element, and you can use multiple gems together to create different spells. It's a fun, on-the-fly approach to magic that means that, even though you will find one or two favorites, you will learn to use all spells at your disposal out of necessity. Surprisingly, this can generate a decent amount of tension in close fights, especially against large mobs where you can't get at a crystal you might really want. The game rewards the player for understanding the simple mechanics, and using them to improvise accordingly. Additionally, the spells available are a good mix of damage and utillity, further emphasising the scrappy, improvisational approach to standard RPG gameplay.\n\nWhere the game is not so solid is character progression; rather than levelling, you can perodically return to the hub town to purchase items and health-ups - the numbers of which progress with the unlocked areas. This means that nominally there is a sense of progression in that you can wade through earlier areas without batting an eyelid, but realistically is just an abitrary imitation of progression. That being said, some of the later spells pack a surprising punch, which is a nice thing to have going into the boss fights.\n\nThe fights themselves are interesting enough, though mostly boil down to Gimmick + Healthbar in true Zelda style. The music that accompanies them, however, is of a surprisingly high caliber. Couple this with a plethora of fun characters and a rather silly presentation to a rather dark plot, and you've got a comfortable RPG experience that even die-hard enemies of the animu will struggle to hate. The game is by no means a masterpiece; but it has a lot of heart too it, and that can go a long way. The gameplay manages to not get stale thanks to a relativley short run-time, meaning that you'll have had your fill before it can get a chance to great on you.\n\nIf you want to pass a few hours and like your RPGs, then I heartily recommend this cute little package, warts and all.","December 22, 2015","true","17.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has fast paced fluent action, but the difficulty curve is way too steep because you don't get a healing spell until the second area of the game and health drops are rare.  The music and environments are good at setting the tempo and mood of the levels, but if you die there are no checkpoints to resume from.  There are just a couple of simple things the creators could have done to make it more player-friendly.  1st on the list would be save points that heal like the Save Spheres in FFX.  For what it's worth though, the week I spent playing it I was completely wrapped up in it crunching numbers for hours to maxamize my character.\n\nI reccomend it but highly suggest using a walk-through to find all of the hidden items along the way.

I picked A Tale of Two Sisters up a while back in a sale mostly on cutsey looks alone, and was pleasently surprised.\n\nTo air my only grievence, the visuals to this game are  DIRE ; 2D sprites in a blocky 3D environment cause countless ♥♥♥♥-ups that make it very hard to figure out which enemy is doing what, and how close things actually are. This is dealt with somewhat by a nifty lock on system that will provide a tad of familiarity to Dark Souls veterans: using it you can dodge and counter with simple mele combos - hit the things enough and they die.\n\nSome enemies, however, are only vulnerable to certain kinds of magic, which is an interesting mechanic in-and-of-itself: Enemies in Chantelise drop crystals which you pick up. Each crystal corresponds to an element, and you can use multiple gems together to create different spells. It's a fun, on-the-fly approach to magic that means that, even though you will find one or two favorites, you will learn to use all spells at your disposal out of necessity. Surprisingly, this can generate a decent amount of tension in close fights, especially against large mobs where you can't get at a crystal you might really want. The game rewards the player for understanding the simple mechanics, and using them to improvise accordingly. Additionally, the spells available are a good mix of damage and utillity, further emphasising the scrappy, improvisational approach to standard RPG gameplay.\n\nWhere the game is not so solid is character progression; rather than levelling, you can perodically return to the hub town to purchase items and health-ups - the numbers of which progress with the unlocked areas. This means that nominally there is a sense of progression in that you can wade through earlier areas without batting an eyelid, but realistically is just an abitrary imitation of progression. That being said, some of the later spells pack a surprising punch, which is a nice thing to have going into the boss fights.\n\nThe fights themselves are interesting enough, though mostly boil down to Gimmick + Healthbar in true Zelda style.

The fact when you buy an item it doubles in price next time you buy it despite being the same item.  Have to grind in ways to get through it.  I wish I could give it a good review I LOVE recettear . . . but this one falls flat.  I'm uncertain I will even beat it for the story . . . which I kind of wanted to do and see if the two were connected more.  The fighting just is too annoying at times.","February 19","false","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That will change because with only in 0.4 hours into i plan on playing it. The game was made by the same people that made "Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale" which was a good game in it's own right. Also take into account this is not a Mega $$$ game it is a indie game, also take into a account the game is only 10$ normal. Which is not much for a honestly good game. So it not one of those games you get "JUST Because It's on sale."\n\nThis game I's something i really never seen before In it take 2D spirits and allows then to move seamlessly in a 3d Wold.\n\nFrom what little i played the combat is fun.  A free roaming hack and slash, It almost reminded me of a early Legend of Zelda style fighting. The game is in all jap but the Text are easy to read and the voice acting matchs the tunes of the game well so you can still feel when someone is sad despite not knowing it.\n\nOnly Con so far i found is "Magic." If your the pure wizerd fighting style I'm sorry. To use magic you have to collect stone that are consumbed as soon as you cast your spell. You can only carry about 7 stone. You will use either 1 stone for basic spells and 2 stones for advance spells. However the spells are at least cool in what they deliver.","May 3","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'll update it later if necessary. I also have not played Recettear or Fortune Summoners yet, though they are in my library. I decided to play this first because it looked colorful and fun, so this will be from somewhat of an outsider's perspective.\n\nThe story concept is pretty simple. You are Elise. Your older sister Chante has been turned into a fairy and you need to find the witch that did it in order to change her back.\n\nElise is patient and kind, though that's all I can say about her right now, as the story hasn't given her much development yet. Chante is perceptive and clever, but also blunt as a boulder with a one-track mind and a VERY short temper. She makes a lot of threats to kick people in the shins. Granted, she is a foot tall, so that's pretty much as far as her threats can go.\n\nAnd of course, since Chante is a fairy, her first spoken line is "Nee nee," which means "Hey." I see what you did there. Fortunately, unlike Navi, she actually respects the player's intelligence with her advice, and it's in a text box in real-time.\n\nAs others have said, this game is unforgiving and expects a lot from the player, and the main reasons for that are in the game mechanics, not the enemies.\n\nLet me elaborate.\n\nYou do not level up in this game. You have your base stats: HP, attack, defense, magic attack, and magic defense. The only one that you can permanently increase is your HP. The rest are entirely dependent on your equipment. You start with only 3 equipment slots, which increases to 4 later on. These together mean you will be changing your equipment a lot, and there is no quick way to do it. The price of items will also dramatically increase with each purchase, and the price of treasures will slightly decrease with each one you sell. So, while more effective equipment and HP medicines do become available, you will still be quickly limited by cost.\n\nYou also do not have skills. You can give yourself different physical attacks with certain crystals, but other than that you will be using magic to do anything other than melee attacks.\n\nYou -also- do not have consumable items. The only items you can carry are either to equip or sell. I think the only exception to this is a remedy that cures paralysis, but I haven't bought that, so I don't know how it works. Regardless, you cannot carry recovery items. The only healing items you can get are randomly dropped by monsters or from specific barrels. They don't disappear until you leave the room, but you cannot take them with you. You eat them as soon as you pick them up. Right off the ground. Yum.\n\nYou ALSO do not have magic. Your itty-bitty sister does. And she cannot use said magic without gems. You obtain these gems by hitting monsters, and there are four different types, one for each element. You can use them individually or combine up to three of them (only two at first) for different effects. The game tells you some of the combinations in one of the menus, but you'll have to figure most of them out yourself. You can carry a total of six gems.\n\nThere are a few problems with this.\n\nThe first is which gems you use are entirely dependent on the order in which you pick them up. If you need a fire spell, but you're currently on a wind gem, you'll have to waste that gem or find something else to use it on, because the first gem determines the element of the spell.\n\nThe second is which gems are dropped and when is completely random. You cannot choose what spells you use and when. The game does. This is made worse by the fact that there IS actually a healing spell, and it requires THREE water gems.\n\nThe third is you will constantly be picking up gems just so you can hit something from a distance. This means a significant amount of time will be spent just managing which gems to pick up and in which order. THIS is made worse by the fact that if you want to have a healing spell in reserve, you are limited to just three gems.\n\nThe fourth is that gems are finite in number. If you run out of gems, you have no magic and are stuck with physical attacks. If you cannot progress without magic, you are officially screwed (either through stalemate or suicide) and must start the dungeon over.\n\nThe fifth is that enemies have specific elemental affinities to them. You can tell which by what color the reticle is when you are locked onto them. If you hit them with a spell of the same element, you will barely hurt them and thus waste a gem.\n\nThe sixth is that you MUST kill every enemy in the room in order to unlock the door to the next room. You only need to do this once, but it is still often easier said than done. On top of that, sometimes the exit is guarded by a giant bomb with several huge magic attacks at its disposal anyway.\n\nThe seventh is threefold: skeletons cannot be killed with physical attacks, clams are only vulnerable for the split second they attack if you get close to them, and bombs explode when they die. You can equip elemental crystals to bypass the skeleton problem, and just git gud to deal with clams (usually), but no such luck with bombs. If you have no long-range magic left, you will be forced to take a large chunk of damage to progress, unless you have already cleared the room.\n\nThe funny thing is, as I just discovered, giant bombs do negligible damage when they explode. I ran out of magic and had to finish it off with my sword. It did 3 damage. The small bomb I fought next did 31 damage and killed me.\n\nThere are a couple problems with melee combat as well. Since the game uses character sprites in a 3D environment (which in itself is bizarre, is this Doom with swords or something?), it's difficult to gauge your proximity to the enemy. On top of that, Chante is not as small as you'd think, and blocks some of your vision. It's usually not a problem, but with small enemies that attack quickly, like piranhas, it can be.\n\nOn the topic of enemies: There are only a few types, but each one's behavior and weaknesses are very different, and you fight a significant number at any given time. They also change in element depending on the dungeon. This prevents the game from becoming overly repetitive, despite the fact that you have to restart the entire dungeon from the beginning every time you die.\n\nThe bosses, though, can be a problem. Each of them has a specific method to defeat them, and you have to figure it out on your own. Chante gives some hints, but they're entirely from her perspective. She's just as clueless as you. This means you will die several times just trying to figure them out, and have to walk through the entire dungeon again for every rematch. That said, once you figure them out, they can be a lot of fun to fight, especially since the skill ceiling of this game is sky-high.\n\nWhat doesn't help the repetition is the lack of gameplay variety. You have one character to control, and while your abilities do expand, they never change. There is a point of the game where you control a different character, but they immediately transform into a direct copy of Elise, and so all that changes is her voice and the color of her hair and eyes. That was more than a little disappointing, especially since the character in question USES MAGIC. WHY MUST YOU DO THIS?\n\n*sigh*\n\nRegardless, I still recommend this game to anyone willing to accept all of the above. I just advise you to be patient with it and don't play it for extended periods. You will die a lot. You don't lose anything but your time by dying, but you will die a lot. And hearing Chante trying to get Elise to wake up never stops being a little heartbreaking, especially since she is completely helpless without you.\n\nIn short: Prepare to Die.","May 14","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The hard part comes from the fact that your healing is very limited at the start, and even later on it's still pretty limited. But it's fun, the dialogue is funny at times, and it's very relaxing to play. Great for just wasting some time. Especially if you want to do the 60 floor dungeon. I think it was 60 floors, and it took like 3 hours to complete. You die, you start over from the begining. However when you do story mode then you only need to complete every area once, then the doors will open and if you die you can just run straight through to there room you were at. The bosses have some different mechanics, so it's not just "punch it until it dies". Also it has cute anime girls.

Dodging is essential in some parts and the game is kind of difficult (don't let the first boss discourage you). Magic is also necessary for the game so you have to learn to not just depend on brute strength. you have to save tons of money to get new items and one wrong move can end it so fast.\n\nIf I can be honest, don't buy the game full price, I don't think it's worth that price, and it does go on sale from time to time so just keep an eye out.\n\nI'm just waiting to meet the little girl from Recettear and just lose my sh!t like I did in Recettear (which I also HIGHLY recommend).\n\nBTW can someone tell me if Recettear came before or after this game...I'm just not sure.","June 4","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"
