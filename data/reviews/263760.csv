I adored the first one "Stair dismount" and this one is even better than the first one being with cars! I do love fast cars and all that, and this game is perfect for having fun and laughing when you see all the accidents. You can also costumize your character being able to place a face of someone you hate and you can also add any car logo you want, like i chose Bugatti :D. Love this game and i'm looking forward to new updates! Have fun playing it yourselves!","January 10, 2014","true","3.4"," 329 of 370 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","329","370","0","7"

Spills, thrills, and mega destruction! This is one of those games that you can pick up very easily and its simple, mindless fun. There is no goal to Turbo Dismount, you kinda just set up a level and watch the carnage. With many customizable options, you can choose how Mr.Dismount explodes or gets beheaded... IN STYLE! If you have a very specific kind of humor and wouldn't find a lifeless body being torn apart and vehicles being ripped apart entertaining (there is no blood in this game as a side note), then this game isn't for you.

The name alone conjures up images of, well, your mom, actually, but this is not the time or the place for that particular tale.\nAnyway, Turbo Dismount is the heartbreaking story of Joe Dismount.  A man trapped in a world that seems to want nothing more than to push him down each time he tries to rise, and hobble him every time he tries to walk.  It's a familiar scene, the cycle of repression which seems torn straight from today's geopolitical headlines.\nAs painful as it is to watch Joe's agonizing struggles, and I must admit it brought a tear to my eye more than once, we have to face the fact that Joe is not entirely a blameless victim here.  Joe appears to be actively seeking his own demise, and every time we see him dangling from the back of a speeding sports car, or rolling off of a cliff in an office chair, we can only wonder what horrors Joe has seen, or dare I say, even participated in, that drive this insatiable lust for the sweet release of death.\nWe may never know, for as simple as Turbo Dismount may appear on the surface, beneath lies a complex web of tortured emotion and dark secrets best left undisturbed.  Some may view Joe as a hero, others may see him as a villan, but where Turbo Dismount succeeds in uniting us, is that we can all see Joe torn into little pieces strewn across a highway in the middle of a twenty vehicle pileup.  I suppose that in the end, that's all that really matters.","June 29, 2014","true","10.8"," 100 of 127 people (79%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","79","100","127","8","6"

I've nearly played a whole day of just sending these men in monster trucks into high-speed traffic, and then observing their limbs torn away from their body in slow motion. This is Turbo Dismount.\n\nTurbo Dismount is one of these few arcade games that I don't get bored with after about an hour or so. Normally I would play this game for a bit, but then get tired of seeing the same thing over and over. But the vast variety in Turbo Dismount is hands down the best thing about this $10 gem.\n\nCustomization in Turbo Dismount is everywhere. You could paste your logo onto the front of a sports car, while Mr. Dismount clings on to the spoiler for dear life as he is shot up ramp leading to space, or make him lie down on a skateboard and push him off a cliff. There are around twenty vehicles in the game, but this number will grow with frequent updates. These vehicles include the super fast "Wedge", to the strange shopping cart, the "Mall Racer". All of which have unique speed and maneuverability.\n\nLevels in Turbo Dismount are what make the game shine. The sheer amount of variation with obstacles and level design is what sets Turbo Dismount apart. One of my personal favourites, "Freeway" has you atop a broken bridge, where poor Mr. Dismount is flung off and plummets onto a busy freeway, meeting his demise below a wreckage of cars. One other amazing thing about Turbo Dismount is the replay system. This allows you to pause, reverse or fast-forward your current dismount. You are able to see what caused the crash, viewing it at up to 1/16x slower or 4x faster.\n\nAnother huge plus is the Steam Workshop. Using Unity, a video game development program, and the free Turbo Dismount package, you can create levels for Turbo Dismount and upload them to Steam. I myself have sometimes made strange and crazy paths of destruction, using Turbo Pads and traffic to my advantage. There is also optional Controller Support, which I found quite confusing while using my Xbox One controller.\n\nOverall Turbo Dismount is definitely worth the money, and with ample achievements, customization and leaderboards, there is enough content to keep you playing for a lot longer that you though you might have. Turbo Dismount is definitely one of those must-have games, and one that won't be leaving my Installed list any time soon.\n\n9.8/10","October 5, 2014","true","23.7"," 50 of 57 people (88%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","88","50","57","19","1"

You're there like," I like these maps I am going to download some more maps." then you download like fifteen more maps, and after about ten more hours of playing and steam workshop, you have like over one hundred fifty-three maps and you are extremely addicted to the game and can't stop playing.

Then I saw it on steam, then it ended up in my possession.\n\nTurbo Dismount is a simple physics sandbox in where your character clings in humorous and non-safe ways onto vehicals and ploughs into traffic.  Really simple.  The crashes and the ammount of damage is a wonder to behold as you see Mr. (Or Mrs.) Dismount roll under cars and loose limbs and break bones.  The Game also has a replay function where you can slow, rewind and fast foward time so you can see that perfect bone crunching angle.  Also you can dot your path to traffic with Turbo Pads, or Speed Bumps, or Half-pipes or mines for the extra 'umph'.\n\nLevels are rather small but they do their job, and you have quite a selection of vehicals and poses, and when you are bored of what the developers made there is a host of steam workshop levels for you to play with aswell.\n\nAnd one level of praise I will give the developers, is customization, you can plaster your face, or someone you like (Or really hate) to the puppet Mr (Or Mrs.) Dismount, and you can attach a logo to your vehicals aswell.\n\nIt's simple, it's fun, it's cheap, you should own this.","August 30, 2014","true","5.5"," 29 of 34 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","29","34","2","4"

Turbo Dismount is where the little guy pedals his tricycle off of a cliff and down five stories onto landmines which launch him up into the air. Turbo Dismount is where the little guy does a loop-de-loop on a section of road and drives straight into a patch of landmines at top speed, making him and his car explode rather spectacularly. Turbo Dismount is where a guy gets into a drag race and finishes it by plowing his car into a wall.\n\nI could tell you about a hundred of these stories, but it's basically a guy, a car, and a set of circumstances in which you have to figure out how to inflict maximum pain on the guy, and the punchline involves grevious bodily harm.\n\nIt's a joke you can re-experience and re-tool over and over, but the punchline itself starts to get stale around four hours after you've played out all the variations of "What happens when an (adjective) (character) in a (type of car) drives into a (insert hazard here)?". It's a bit like Mad Libs, but with physics and objects.\n\nI don't see myself playing this again anytime soon, but the time I did spend with it was hilarious, and there's a level based off of the Springfield Gorge scene from an early Simpsons episode called "Bart The Daredevil".

It offers a wealth of vehicles to choose from, a massive set of obstacles to play around, different characters, poses and camera angles to play around with on a set of levels, some can be played for hours whilst others get boring fast. Steam Workshop allows you to download user made levels and it's cool to see just how creative people are being with it.\n\n\nThe visual style is basic but offers satisfyingly crunchy sound design for destruction and dismemberment. You have no real control over your car, you simply set the speed and watch it go (however there ais also levels with steering which honestly is quite hard to control) which many people complain about but I personally really like. It gives the game a fun relaxed feel when you don't have to think about where you're going, instead you can just sit back, relax and watch the carnage.\n\n\nThere's also customization which allows you to change the head of your character and the logo of your vehicle which has proven to be absolutely hilarious.\n\nOverall I would recommend Turbo Dismount. A fun little timewaster to turn on for a bit and cause havoc in. I will say however that it's not for everyone and I can see people getting bored with it rather quickly.\n\n7/10\nGood","January 9, 2015","true","28.9"," 22 of 28 people (79%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","79","22","28","9","4"

Stair Dismount for mobile devices. It was one of the best time-wasters I had ever played, and Turbo Dismount, the sequel that I never even fathomed would be made, is even better than the prequel. You have a selection of quite a few different vehicles, from a monster truck to a skateboard to a red Angry Bird to a fire truck and everything in between. You also have different poses to choose from specific to each vehicle. You choose the map, speed, and GET ♥♥♥♥ING WRECKED by whatever you run into. It could be traffic, a brick wall, landmines, or scenery. It's so fun to see your little dude get mauled by everything in sight. That sounds messed up and quite gruesome, but there is no blood or gore in the game, however, there IS dismemberment, and I'm pretty sure that someone in the future will find a way to make a bloody mod for the game. The physics are well-done in some parts and downright hilarious in others, like when you run into traffic, and then there's a pileup and cars go flying everywhere. If there is one questionable thing I have to say about physics, it's how the guy, if he gets flung into the air, he will slowly stop spinning while in the air. This defies physics and just bugs me a bit for some reason I don't understand. There are also modded levels you can make for the game, which gives the fans something to do to contribute to the game. All in all, this is a time-waster worth the money. It's fun and hilarious and the modding community is very creative.

I was the same way at one point. Take my advice: just watch those videos some more. They're way more fun than the actual game.\n\nThe objective of Turbo Dismount is to orchestrate vehicular accidents that cause as much damage as possible to your vehicle and the hapless mannequin forced into this dilemma. You have at your disposal various maps, vehicles, obstacles to litter the course with, and poses for your mannequin. If you've seen any of the aforementioned YouTube videos, you're no doubt aware of the sort of destruction that can ensue. This would be all fine and dandy if it actually felt like the player had any real control over the outcomes of these crashes.\n\nAccelerating the vehicle consists of holding down a button and releasing it at the moment when a meter is at the desired level. Because of how obscenely quickly the meter fills up and then empties again, precise timing is nearly impossible. This is compunded by the vehicles' tendency to do whatever they want to, such as letting up on the gas when you want them to speed up, vice versa. Many of the obstacles frequently fail to produce an intended effect, and sometimes fail to produce any effect at all. Even in levels that involve other traffic, those other vehicles appear in random order and speed by so quickly that it's nigh impossible to properly time a collision.\n\nThe physics engine is capable, but unpredictable. A satisfying crash can have vehicle and body parts being strewn about and colliding with each other in amusing ways, but these moments are scarce thanks to the physics' refusal to behave consistently. It's also frustrating how your ragdolling mannequin often struggles to maintain its pose, or even stay attached to the vehicle, in order to have it hit something in a desired manner.\n\nAll of these frustrations combine to form an experience that is usually comprised of restarting a level over and over and over again to get a desired result. When a beautiful catastrophe does happen, it tends to feel less like the results of the player's planning and effort, and more like the result of unintentional happenstance. Even if the player learns the mechanics and nuances well enough to consistently create satisfying crashes, what's left at that point is just a shallow, one-note time waster. Ragdoll crashes car. Ragdoll goes ragdolling. Oh, how the lolz are killing me.\n\nTurbo Dismount is a one-trick pony that ♥♥♥♥s up its one trick nine times out of ten. It may be worth getting if you have some easily amused eight-year-old children in your home who are in need of a distraction.

Unlike PAIN, however, I found Turbo Dismount more entertaining.\n\nPAIN had optional objectives that you could complete at any time to unlock a few things here and there, but any sort of objective or unlock system makes screwing around feel kinda weird and almost unenjoyable. You feel like you're not accomplishing anything, and there are things that you might want but you won't get by messing around. PAIN also had an immature sense of humor (using a donut shop to make ♥♥♥♥ jokes? Seriously?) that just turns me away for some reason.\n\nTurbo Dismount on the other hand, has no objectives or unlockables. In other kinds of games, this would be a VERY BAD THING. But in a game like this, it works really well for some reason. Choose a level, select a vehicle, and hit the accelerator. And hocus pocus, just like that, you've caused a major traffic pileup (you jerk).\nAnother great part of Turbo Dismount is how smooth the replay system is. The replay system in PAIN is oddly awkward to use for some reason, but Turbo dismount somehow gets it incredibly right by giving you no controls other than playback speed and camera movement.\nTurbo Dismount also features dismemberment (that is not at all gory, because the characters are pretty much just crash test dummies), which makes everything SO much more satisfying. You'll find out what I mean when you ask yourself "wait, what happened to his head, and where's one of his arms?" then you realize that you have no idea when he lost his head/arm, and you don't know where they went. And that all works really well with the replay system, because you can find out what happened to said head/arm.\nTurbo Dismount is just a fun little game to waste time on.\n\nAnother thing: this is just a more interesting version of Stair Dismount, which you can grab for your smartphone. But this one is WAY better.","October 31, 2014","true","57.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

I'm enjoying the game so much that I subscribed to every single level in the workshop (almost 300). Looking forward to the new updates and I really hope they add more achievements.

And it was. For a short matter of time. My point is the gameplay gets repetitive and boring after some time. You hold the dismount button, wait for the Mr. Dismount to get to his destination and see him getting hurt for a few seconds, (maybe he made a funny pose you can take screenshot of!) look at him laying on the ground for few seconds (to complete the dismount) and repeat. There's not too much of cool vehicles to choose from, or the maps. If you decide to download some from workshop you don't really have a variety of them. Either it's skyfall, minefield or manual driving obstacle course. What really annoyed me was that 1. If you hit wall or something a little bit with your vehicle you lose the control. 2. You can't choose your default camera. I had to change it from vehicle camera to character camera everytime because vehicle camera was the default one and i've just wanted to look at this poor guy getting smashed instead of the car/whatever he rode in staying there in place when everything cool happens somewhere else. Thanks for reading, hope it helped.","November 25, 2015","false","1.4"," 38 of 72 people (53%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","53","38","72","4","0"

If it comes out with free or really cheap DLC, you should probably only buy it if it goes on sale, like I did. But, for the levels, vehicles, and characters they have along with the free ones you can download or make yourself, it's not a bad game. I played through each level many times before getting bored just to come back in a week and do it again to try and top my own scores. So what if it seems narcistic to torture, maime and kill a dude to see how high of a score you can get by doing so. Let's all agree it's just fun to see a crash test dummy bite that dust.

There isn't unlimited things to do but no matter what happens there is no chance you will ever get the same dismount. Which I find intersting because you can end up doing something really funny and then something even funnier now that you had figured out what would be better to add on. I will admit I think some people don't like it because it's not their type of game but for the majority I would recommend this because of the pure randomness and fun that can be done with it.","May 23, 2014","true","2.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It has a good soundtrack and keeps track of your scores aswell as a leaderboard. There is also a workshop to get new maps from if you get bored of the old ones. Its always awesome to see a crash test dummy looking thing get blown to peices from crashing into things. It has a neat way of dismounting by holding down the left mouse button and letting go at just the right time to maximize speed.\n\nCONS: This game doesn't have alot of pizazze to it. All you do is drive cars around and crash into other cars (but if you like that sort of thing then I guess this is a pro) I have played it for about half an hour and I got bored really fast, weather thats because I felt rushed to try the game or I just didn't like it. For me, its only fun for about 15 minutes at a time, but who knows, you may like it for hours.\n\n\nSidenote: I would absoloutly LOVE this game if there was at least local multiplayer. Like you were both in a car and you could both change your poses and the host could choose to dismount and choose where the obstacles would be.","April 13, 2014","true","3.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Infernolizard/recommended/263760/","Infernolizard","infernolizard64","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Infernolizard/","12 products in account","INTRODUCTION\nTurbo dismount is a game I've put a lot of time into. The graphics are great, the possibilities are nearly infinite, and the workshop has thousands of levels. If you want to get the game, yet you are still slightly skeptical, here's my review on Turbo Dismount.\n\nSTORY\nOh, story. Yeah, this game has none! The most a completionist can do is play all the pre-made levels and get all the achievements, which will still take around 20-30 hours. The point of Turbo dismount is to mess around with what you got. I've (so far) put around 27 hours into the game and I still can't get enough of the game.\n\nFEATURES\nThe game comes with some levels to mess around in, but you can always download levels from the steam workshop if you get tired of those levels. You can choose several vehicles, which are all unique in their own way. There's a Tricycle, Fire truck, Wrecking ball, Skateboard, Sports car, etc. If you are wondering, you can choose different characters that can pose and be customized. One of my friends had fun putting the face of Donald Trump on his character, then he would do whatever he wanted to. For poses, there's tons of them, exclusive to each character. Yes, you can do a Miley Cyrus pose on the wrecking ball, and you can do poses on the Wastelander (Inspired by the Mad Max films) that are related to the movies. There's also obstacles you can place down such as a speed boost pad and ramps.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nAfter choosing your character, vehicle, pose, and obstacles, you have to hold down [SPACE BAR] to adjust speed. It's a frustrating task because if you release it at the wrong time, you can go really slow, or way to fast for you to comprehend.  I can still use turbo pads to go fast though, because I usually want to go fast. Characters can have their bones broken, dismembered, twisted the opposite direction, etc, and makes the game more interesting. The physics engine is not realistic though. Once I was using a skateboard and my head got blown off from a wooden paddle when I was only going around a smooth 20 mph ( around 32 kph for foreigners).\n\nAUDIO\nThe SFX is clear and more realistic than the physics engine. The sounds bones crushing and muscles tearing is what gets me. I probably wouldn't have laughed at this game if SFX and the music weren't there. The music is a jazzy rhythm, and makes the game seem like an overly-edited fail compalation that you can control.\n\nPLAYABILITY\nThe game has barely any glitches, and recieves laughs from anybody who watches it or plays it. It has the perfect blend of humor and control of paths that I like. This is a must play when my friends come over, and we end up putting 1 or 2 hours of into it everytime. We can laugh at the insanity that happens before our eyes when our character gets blown up by a mine and afterwords mauled by a snow plow. If your mind is thinking "Why would you laugh at that, ONLY SADISTIC MINDFREAKS WOULD LAUGH AT THAT!", well I have a claim. Your so called "character" is a test dummy, and the game is only a simulation. Also you would be calling Jacksepticeye, Markiplier, Pewdiepie, Kwebblelkop, Ssunde, Ihascupquake, and DanTDM sadistic mindfreaks ( If you don't know who they are, look them up on a trusty site I call Youtube).\n\nSUM UP:DO I RECCOMEND THIS GAME?\nI reccomend this game to a certain crowd. If you are easlily offended, than no. Despite a couple cons, it's definitely the most fun I've had destroyng stuff on my PC (Just Cause 3 is on my XBOX One, so I'm specifying to PC), and is no doubt, a "kinetic tragedy"(that's the games slogan)\n\nMy rating? 8.25 out of 10. You can play it with friends, family, yourself, and can see what sort of crazy things the community has done because I forgot to mention that you can upload gifs\n\nBy, InfernoLizard64","January 24","true","37.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Yes\nHowever, it is not worth the $10 pricetag unless you can easily spare this money. I bought this game on sale for $4, and I feel this is a fair price for the game. Why?\n\nWith the steam workshop, you will probably get around 5 hours at max on this game, and this is the sole reason the game is not worth the $10 in my opinion. It has a degree of replayability, but you'd eventually get tired of the same track your car follows, the same amount and place of obstacles, and the small maps.\n\nThe crash physics are mediocre, and if you want an automobile game with great and realistic crash physics along with a decent amount of mods and replayability I'd reccomend beamNG drive. This game's physics are more fictional and cartoony, but this isn't a downside, rather a different concept.\n\nTo the developers (What I think needs to be improved to make this game worth the full price):\n- Ability to drive custom paths\n- Ability to mod custom models, veichles and veichle properties, obstacles, and physics\n- More detailed and textured models, add aesthetical variety to the different maps\n- Add the ability to place unlimited obstacles wherever, not constrained to certain spots.\n- Larger maps not constrained by an invisible box but instead more aesthetical pleasing walls/mountains/ect.\n\nAgain, the theme and concept of this game isn't bad but indeed "cartoony" and unique but it needs more features to lengthen it's replayability and add some elements of sandbox. If you enjoy this type of game it's $4 sale price can be a reasonable buy.","September 2, 2014","true","4.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The games where you play as and with the ragdoll to inflict damage, and "pain" upon a realistic enough counterpart of a human body, proablly similar enough to your own.\nI think this game started as an online flash player sort of game, Stair dismount maybe it was. Anyway, it got very popular and people started to call out saying they wanted more from the game. I think they implemented mods and new maps and such into it, then, later on, they came out with a new game, which had trucks and walls to smash too. Now obviously this game is what has come of those early versions. It is cool to see! The company, (I'm not sure if they were there all along or if they just picked this up for funding reasons) But they have successfully made a good product here on Steam with it. As you can see for yourself, there is a lot to be doing with this game, all working well.

Then this came out. It's all the fun of lobbing ragdolls off cliffs with the added bonus of vehicles and slow motion replays. You can create more levels for the game using the Unity editor and port them into the game and upload them to the workshop where other people can play them. While the extent of what you can do in the editor is fairly limited right now, it is still in development so you can definitely expect more features to come.\n\nPros:\n- Great physics engine\n- Decent variety of vehicles and poses\n- Ability to replay your dismount slow motion\n- User created levels on the workshop\n- Obstacles you can place in the level\n\nCons:\n- Limits to what you can do in the editor","July 26, 2014","true","22.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game, is hilarious, you play as Mr./Mrs. Dismount, your goal is to cause pain to yourself in order to gain points, the higher score you get, the higher you are on the leaderboards.  In the original, you were to push yourself from an elevated position and fall down stairs or some random obsticals.  However, in this game, you need to drive a car into oncoming traffic in order to complete your goal, which is okay, but they should add a mode that is the original game.\n\nThis game ranks on ridiculousness right up there with goat simulator, it even has STEAM WORKSHOP as well, which means if you play all the levels and get board, there is still the WORKSHOP levels to look forward to.\n\nI give this game a 9/10, a 10/10 if they add a stair dismount mode, 9001/10 if it gets even funnier.","June 27, 2014","true","16.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It makes great recording material, and can even generate a large amount of laughs from a group of friends huddled around the monitor. The customization means that you can smack the face of anyone you dislike on this ragdoll and let him/her fly! However, it can get a bit boring after a couple compiled hours of gameplay, but is a nice pick-up-and-play.

Although I feel the price is a bit high, the more content it gets the more it will be worth, and I anticipate the price to equal the content very soon. It is a ragdoll physics game where you aim your cars with your ragdoll inside towards various dangers, some of which you control. You choose some of the obstacles, the speed and the direction, but you CANNOT steer the cars. I was put off by that because I expected to be able to, but I was quite satisfied regardless. The map veriety is excellent already as is the selection of cars and obstacles.\n\nPros:\n-Good content and veriety. More to come.\n-Fun and entertaining\n-good FPS and graphics\n\nCons:\n-Scoreboard glitches, forget's your score/doesn't count it.\n-Inability to control the car or person's movements after dismount begins.\n\nAdvice for developers: I would propose something akin to the "Burnout" series method of slightly affecting your player's movements after the crash. Otherwise, keep the new content coming and great job so far!","January 15, 2014","true","18.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I know this first hand. I took care of this being as the mentor, as I am a hyper elite of the syntax-sector of the Illuminati. I have experimented with teleportation, Obama, and lizards shape-shifting into Secret-service agents. When the syntax-sector of the hyper elite barracks in the north pole, most experiments broke loose. This prototype, however, was smarter than most. With little to no signs of lizard-like structures when shape-shifted, he was the perfect man for our job.

I know this first hand. I took care of this being as the mentor, as I am a hyper elite of the syntax-sector of the Illuminati. I have experimented with teleportation, Obama, and lizards shape-shifting into Secret-service agents. When the syntax-sector of the hyper elite barracks in the north pole, most experiments broke loose. This prototype, however, was smarter than most. With little to no signs of lizard-like structures when shape-shifted, he was the perfect man for our job. I once used my transformation powers, but was quickly spotted, and the extra-molecular shape-shifting superdinosaur came and saved me, with the hyperbeam harvested from Dialga in the Pokemon dimension. Yes, that show is real, made by the Ancient Gods from Sector-B//AnimationDimension//X-3, we transported the creatures into the "intelligent" planet called Earth, in my opinion, the weakest sector of the whole Illuminati.

This game will get you through some tough times, I guarentee it.\n(Terrible review, right?)\n\nNew ReviewThis game is absolutely hilarious, I'll give it that much. It also brings in some great mechanics and pretty cool customization features so that for some people this game really never gets old. Unfortunately after some play time I found myself get a little bit bored of this game, (though that was a long time ago, I might try this game again and update my review once more!) but I can definitely see its value in only $9.99. I've seen so many people laugh their butts off to hours of this game it's hard to deny its credibility. I just want to say however, if you're someone that doesn't get laughs out of comic violence and pain than this might not be the game for you, because that's pretty much all its designed to deliver. Like I said, customization and the STEAM Workshop makes it great, but there's still whether you find the subject matter funny or not.\n\nAll in all though, I would recommend this game.","August 5, 2014","true","1.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

It is a fun, albeit a bit sadistic if you're kindly to crash-test dummies, title that is all about seeing how brutally dismember the protagonist in violent collisions, scoring points for how well you have strewn their body parts across the landscape with their head under a lorry's wheels and chassis grinding for bonus point multipliers.  Stress-relief, sadism, whatever might tickle your fancy, this title is perhaps the best that offers the gameplay everyone who played those crappy "Crast-Test Dummy" games in the 90s REALLY wanted.\n\nBeautifully complete for the price already, and developing upon more for what I consider a "Ten Dollar Timewaster" - something to do while you're doing something else, and I think it does the job more than adequately.  The developer has already made "Stair Dismount" which I would suggest for a demo of sorts - that is the gameplay you're to expect from this title as well.\n\nThe vehicles, poses, and the ability to reskin your crash-test dummy as a clown or whatever just makes it even more fun.","September 12, 2014","true","22.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

I make 3-4 or more levels every update myself!\nMobile Version is free, but you can only play few levels and use 3 vehicles, but if you buy it on the PC for 10 dollars, you can get all the levels, vehicles and fan-made levels!\nGet it, and you will not regret it!\nIf you regret it, then your brain is being powered by FNAF, Pokemon and Picachu, when it needs to be powered by Steam and TurboDismount!!!","January 19, 2015","true","17.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Turbo Dismount is all of that and more, for it is easily the most relaxing, cathartic experience available in gaming. There is no blood, no violence, merely your featureless ragdoll getting abused and blasted into pieces from various impacts, as seen again and again in instant replay.\n\nThis is what a sandbox game is supposed to be. Garry's Mod is more flexible, to be sure, but this is so delightful to pick up and play. You can just enjoy a few crashes, or you can elaborately tweak your path, the obstacles in it, and even the way your character rides on the deathtrap of your choosing. Even in this early state (as of writing this, update #8 is out), the game exhibits no glitches that I've seen, and performance is perfectly smooth even on my aging machine. You have no excuse.\n\nSo, if the idea of violently crashing over and over with no consequences sounds appealing, spend the 6.99$, and never quit giggling. Ever.","April 6, 2014","true","44.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

IGN\n\nIf you're a person who wants to experience chaos, let off some steam, of just screw around, this game is great. There are so many different ways to crash your cars and kill yourself (Trycicle into landmines for exapmle) you can just create so much chaos and madness. The game can also glitch and freeze at times so that's a little annoying. The graphics aren't great, put I'll let it slide. Even from all of it, the game can get old at times and you just don't play it for a while.

If you get games from there. I found out about this game because of Jacksepticeye and Markiplier hell, even pewdiepie. They made the game look relativily fun and I was intrested in buying it.\n\nI got the game when it was on a deal and got it for 5 $ I think. To be honest, this should be lower then that, even though it was just 5 dollars.\n\nThe game is fun at first, but it get's dull very fast, the only type of gameplay in this rollercoaster of experience is 2 clicks on your mouse.... That's it. Click it to start, click it again to measure the speed that the dude will go off the ramp, road etc. It is very enjoyable at first but like I said it get's dull very quickly.\n\nThe physics and replay time really make the game hilarous, once again at first. But if you tell your friends the same joke again, again and again it just isn't funny anymore. That's where the game falls sure there are maps and diffrent setups you can do on maps, but it just want's to tell you/us the same joke over and over again.\n\nTrust me not worth your time, get someting that will keep you entertained for a longer period of time.","March 29, 2015","false","19.4"," 7 of 20 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","7","20","0","0"

You can select a camera, but when you switch the autosteering (recommended because the manual steering isn't very good) it sets your camera back to "vehicle camera" even though that's frequently not the best choice to choose an auto-steered route.\n\nThe cinematic camera frequently provided the best combination of view distance, height, etc., but you can't rotate it.

In fact, there are quite a few good things about it - the degree to which you can experiment with the numerous obstacles and veichles to get different outcomes can be impressive and the courses themselves well-designed, encouraging maximum destruction and crazy hijinks all throughout. Workshop intergration is well-done, with a bunch of user-created levels to play around in, and of course there is always a good laugh to be had from a crash dummy getting as screwed up as possible.\n\nBut the fact of the matter is that it's nowhere near as interesting to crash a car for the 100th time as it is to crash it for the first. After about 3 hours of play, I grew incredibly and extremely bored with the repetition of crashing, the bland style of the game, and with the lack of variety overall. After a while, it starts to all feel like 'same old, same old' - just the same freaking thing over and over again throughout and throughout without much difference. Even the Workshop levels (which tend to blow things up the absolute extreme) can't stop the monotony from breaking through.\n\nYou might like this game a lot more than I did. You might find the game's explosive antics a lot more amusing than I ever would. You might be crashing cars way more times than I could ever bear. But for me, this game is nothing more - and nothing less - than what it is: a virtual way to crash cars.

It is perfectly functional, but calling it a 'game' is not really accurate. It is a ragdoll physics simulator. There are no goals, no progression, no interactivity. You pick a vehicle (of which there is certainly a fair variety as far as looks, but no real differences besides small/big/fast/slow), click a button, and watch the vehicle crash into obstacles. That's it. You can even play almost the exact same thing on the developer's website for FREE.\n\nIt is well made, looks and sounds great, and seems to have an active Workshop community.

It's not bad for all of the 10 minutes of content that there is. It looks fun,  but what you see is all that there is. There's not too much destructability past what you'd expect, and the levels are few. Some good ideas for vehicles, but there's no controlling them past launch speed and the 4-5 preset paths. I'd give this about a 2/5. Also, there's 3-4 preset placements of a few objects, but they don't change too much.","April 18, 2014","false","3.0"," 17 of 42 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","17","42","0","2"

It's simply a game to have a little laugh with, and not really worth the money in my opinion.\n\n(P.S: I can usually create my own progress/longevity in games, even by creating my own leaderboards/leagues or something silly to test myself or see improvements etc. This game isn't even conducive to that, once you've destroyed the guy on each level there really isn't that much more to achieve).","December 31, 2014","false","1.4"," 0 of 6 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","6","0","0"

The only reason people keep buying this game and thinking its good is because of the youtubers point of view when playing this game.

If Steam allows itself devolve into the cesspool which Apple's App Store has become, then I am not going consider games above $2 there either.\n\nDo not purchase this game.

The only things you control are the vehicles, positions, obstacles, and paths. 17 times out of 20, nothing happens, and when something happens you get really bored of it very quickly, because the guys head flew off or a truck hit him, but there's nothing other than dismemberment and your vehicle getting broken into parts.

Basically you get a bunch of tracks, vehicles, characters and obstacles to cause accidents. You have less control than it seems, you can place objects only where the game allows you to.\nBasically you have to push a button and let the vehicle crash into random stuff, far from being interactive.\nThe physics it's far from perfects, every vehicles (especially the NPC ones) are mostly made of rubber and don't even get wrecked. The ragdoll effect is acceptable, but I've seen better. I don't see the point of having different characters and motorbikes if they can't ride them for more than a few seconds and barely reach the obstacles you have placed. Every other vehicle is mostly useless, ranging from huge, slow and totally unfunny to see crashing to intolerbly fast cars, seeing them crashing after a second from start. Also most of the time your character will fall out of the vehicle before crashing anywhere, thus ending the session very early.\nOther than that, you have to follow some predetermined steering paths which the vehicles can't even follow correctly. You have manual steering but it doesn't make the game any funnier.\nThe default cameras are placed very badly, not letting you see anything. You have to use the manual one which is barely good depending on how you can handle it.\n\nIt could have been a good idea, but it's very badly developed. I would rather wait for a fully functional BeamNG.","December 28, 2014","false","1.1"," 0 of 9 people (0%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","0","0","9","3","0"

Yes.\nIs it worth $10? No.\nThe game is fun, for a few minutes at least. There is little to no interactivity, and there isn't really much to do. The entire game is click dismount, watch ragdoll crash into car, click reset, and repeat. A few bits on the car falls off, maybe a limb falls off on the ragdoll, and that's all that happens.","January 22, 2015","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
