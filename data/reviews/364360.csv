I would imagine my warriors battle hoardes of Orcs and Chaos as I played against my brother and my friends. Great heroes and huge, sprawling battles raged in my mind. My brother's Empire troops standing bravely against my vampire hoarde!\n\nThe only place I could actually see something akin to these battles was through the Total War franchise with Rome Total War which we also used to play together. Ambushing his Roman column with Gaulic warriors!\n\nI have waited twelve years for this pairing to come along. Even since I heard the announcements I have been eagerly waiting. Despite all of that pressure, the game did not disappoint. The battles that I dreamed of seeing as a kid are coming to life before my eyes.\n\nI now live in the USA and my brother is still in England.  We are playing our cooperative campaign to recreate those same rivalries, stories and memories that we would make with our models on our kitchen table as kids. Technology like this makes life better. Three thousand miles apart and yet thanks to this platform we can feel that same joy and excitement that we did back then.\n\n10/10 would make more childhood dreams come true","May 25","true","21.5"," 1,262 of 1,387 people (91%) found this review helpful 91 people found this review funny","91","262","1","91","47"

But before that I just want to say my initial review was to point out that, devs are people. They make mistakes. There was a small issue causing this bug and that you should have waited it out before kneejerking it to the review page, give people the benefit of the doubt before you condemn them - especially after only a couple hours of release. The issue I had was patched within hours of release. Now, if the game was STILL unplayable, I might march to a different tune. But don’t be so damn negative right off the bat people, life is much easier if you're an optimist. Also, if you gave the game a bad review for that issue but are now crushing little dwarfs with your trolls, you might change your review :)\n\nNow for my thoughts: The game is amazing. I've been playing Total War games since 2005 and this is by far the best Total War game to date. In previous TW games you’ve played as humans, obviously, and while this is cool to be historically accurate, what it meant was that all the playable factions were basically some variation of the other with differences in culture. In TW:WH, each faction is COMPLETELY different. The tactics you learned as the Empire will NOT hold when fighting as the Vampire. Plus, each faction has their own campaign aspect, the Empire can appoint Lords to offices that give bonuses, the Vamps have to have lands be corrupted before entering them, otherwise they take attrition, the Dwarfs have a book of grudges that each grudge has to be “settled”, and the Greenskins have to maintain a level of “fightiness” within their armies or else they start in-fighting and take attrition. What all this means, is that when you start a new campaign, it feels like a whole new game almost.\n\nAlso, the UI in this game is a MASSIVE improvement over Rome II and Attila. Now you can understand what buildings you need where to get what. Gone are the days of going down the rabbit hole of the building browser trying to figure out what does what and how it will all play out. The message system is sooo much better. Many times in the prev TW games you’d start a turn and have to click through 4-5 pop up messages then there would be 10 more side ones to go through. They’ve boiled it down to what's important and overall I think have hit the right balance between complexity and depth and learnability. After all, this is nowhere as deep as like EUIV or Civ 5, but its similar, I mean the point of this game is to get more armies to smash other armies.\n\nNow for the battles, HOLY ♥♥♥♥ THEY ARE AWESOME. The feeling of watching your Demigryph Knights slam into the back of an unsuspecting unit of little Dwarfs and watching them fly through the air cannot properly be described in words. Where TW has sort of simplified the campaign, they added complexity to the battlefield. No more of the rock, paper, scissors formula of the old TW games where spears beat cav, cav beat swords, and swords beat spears. Now you have flying monstrous units, trolls, undead armies that can pop up from the ground, gunnery, infantry,  giant comets of magic that rain from the sky and hexes that curse your men.I feel like some of the magic will need some balancing especially since magic damage does not scale with unit size. But over all battles are awesome. It definitely will take some time to master but it is so much fun trying to figure it out.\n\nPerformance wise, I think it's great, I got a GTX 970 W/ i7-6700k, and while in the campaign get a smooth 90 fps on high and 50-60 on ultra, in battle usually 75-80 on high and 40-50 on ultra with few dips, even if there are a ton of units. I've only had one game crash, but no big deal! Overall I give it a 9/10. If you’re new to TW, start here! The prev TW games are much more complicated and sometime unnecessarily. TW:WH struck the right balance and I definitely recommend it.\n\nTL;DR - best TW game yet. All the races feels completely different, the UI is waaay better, battles are great, challenging, and loads of fun and the game is well optimized and runs good.\n\nCheers :)","May 24","true","67.7"," 8,631 of 10,140 people (85%) found this review helpful 4,906 people found this review funny","85","631","10","906","312"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198065186325/recommended/364360/","76561198065186325","Sgt. Lillard","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198065186325/","36 products in account","I want to start by saying that I have been a fan of Warhammer since I was 8 years old and my stepdad brought over some Lizardmen miniatures for me to play with while he wooed my mom.  I have collected several armies over the years, played many games, and given up hours upon hours to reading the novels, looking at the lore, and writing my own adventures in the Old World and beyond.  This is and has been my favorite fantasy setting since I was a child.  No other world brings all of the greatest fantasy elements together, ties them into an awesome renaissance era, and then adds in death and despair (and crack-addicted ratmen!) by the truckload quite like Games Workshop has with Warhammer.  Before you write the rest of this review off as the ramblings of a fanboy, I want you to realize that this absolute love of Warhammer has lead me to hold everything done with IP to the absolute highest standards.  I have played every ♥♥♥♥♥♥ video game that I can find with the Warhammer logo and been grossly disappointed with all of them, with the exception of Vermintide which scratches a completely different itch.  Since I was eight years old I have wanted a video game that let me control The Emperors armies, a game that let me see the Old World in all of it's beautiful, deadly detail.  Every new Warhammer game I've seen has raised my hopes that this is the game that will let me do that, this is the game that will bring the ridiculously overpriced tabeltop miniatures to life.  Every new game has let me down, until now.\n\nMechanically, this is one solid piece of clockwork.  The game is wonderfully optimized, I run it with everything set to ultra and I have yet to see so much as a stutter in my 30 hours, and I do NOT have a top of the line PC.  The graphics are great (for a Total War game), and the special effects and monsters all look stunning.   Campaign mechanics have been streamlined and simplified to make the empire building aspect of the Total War series fun and less of a hassle.  No longer do you have to worry about food, or sanitation, fertility.  Public order is now the only number the player must keep track of.  No longer do you have to look at a building and decide if the -12 public order is worth the 10% increase to your soldier's armor.  Now buildings either let you recruit units or give you positive effects.  That isn't to say that it makes empire building easier, just less of a chore.  You still need to plan out your building slots rather well, as you only have a select few in each province.\n\nNew mechanics are brought into the campaign map as well, and these are well done and add a nice, new layer to the depth presented by the game.  One of these is corruption.  Certain factions bring corruption to the lands.  This is generally done slowly and with little notice until it seems all at once that it hits you.  Corruption brings about public order penalties to factions that don't use them, as well as attrition for their armies.  This can be countered by certain buildings and heroes.  Sieges have been revamped, so now instead of attacking the entire city you only attack a single stretch of the walls.  While it makes the battles simpler, it also allows for the AI to stand with the player on even footing, and it makes the sieges more fun.  In Rome 2 and Attila I found myself auto-resolving almost every single siege because of how lackluster and boring they were.  In TW:Warhammer I don't auto-resolve sieges at all, because they are fun and exciting.  It's fantastic watching my units of Orcs fight for supremecy on the Dwarven walls.\n\nSpeaking of heroes, they are the replacer for agents.  On the campaign map they are exactly like the agents of old, however they have a new ability, and that is the action that lets them join an army.  When embedded into an army, a hero fights on the battle map along with the army, and they are awesome.  They look great and have awesome special abilities to boot.  Lords replace the generals, and are much better.  They stand alone, but are tougher and more resilient than the general's units of past games.  They also collect followers, weapons, armor, and gear that can all be equippied to them and the heroes of your choosing.\n\nThe AI is much smarter than previous Total War games, though that's not to say that it doesn't act stupid at times.  All too often have I requested peace from a faction, just to be denied and then offered peace and a fat purse for accepting the offer a turn later.  It makes no sense.  On the battlefield the AI is a lot smarter as well, able to use the new units just as well if not better than me at times.  Speaking of the new units...Warhammer fits in perfect with Total War.  Most of the new creatures and units are incredibly detailed, and bring about new facets to the battlefield.  Flying units, giant monsters and magic are all welcome editions to the age old Total War formula, and they fit in so well.  Battlefields are so much more intense when there are steam tanks fighting dragons than they ever could be with Romans fighting Carthagenians.  That's not to say that battles got a lot more complicated, either.  The special abilities of units (like spearwalls for hoplites) have been removed, with spearmen bracing themselves against charges automatically if they're standing still.  This is good, because the special abilities that Lords, Heroes, Wizards, and magic items can be complicated enough when you have a lot of them, and sometimes can turn into micro-managing hell.  While battles are still complex, chaotic messes, it's at least manageable given all that is going on.\n\nThe five factions are all unique, both on the campaign map and the battle map, which adds a lot of replayability to the game.  I've read complaints that the end-game is repetitive because all factions have to beat Chaos back to the wastes at the end, but I don't really know what else they were expecting.  Chaos has always been the big bad of the Warhammer World, so it makes sense that a finale would consist of beating them down, hard.  All in all, well done.\n\nNow, for all of the praise, this game still has it's negatives, but they are few and far between.  The biggest issue seems to be with balance.  Some damage spells are extremely powerful, able to wipe out high-tier units with a single cast, while most aren't even worth their casting cost at all.  Agent actions are also overpowered, doing huge amounts of damage to entire armies while costing very little.\n\nThere are other things that bother me, too, when it comes to staying with the lore of the world.  The minor human nations have been extremely generalized, receiving mostly reskinned Empire units.  This is sad, because these nations are important to the lore.  While I understand that they're not nor will they be playable, that doesn't mean that on the campaign map they shouldn't be fleshed out even a little.  I mean come on, Kislev doesn't even get the Tsarina Katerina as their leader, instead they recieve a generic Empire lord!\n\nCertain locations also don't receive the attention that they should.  Certain Empire cities are supposed to be works of art, yet are just generic versions of each other.  Dwarfen holds aren't even close to how they're described in the lore.  Also, factions are missing entire chunks of their rosters, which I'm willing to bet will be added with DLC.  I'm not even upset about that, because I'm used to GW practices of nickel and diming you, so that was to be expected.  The game even has mod support, something I never thought possible with GW involved.  The game isn't perfect, but CA has worked very hard for a very long time to make it what it is, and it is great.  You can immediately tell the amount of love that the game has been given, and if more games were given this amount of attention to detail, we would all live in a better place with better games.\n\n9.5 out of 10, Great job Creative Assembly","May 26","true","129.1"," 469 of 526 people (89%) found this review helpful 48 people found this review funny","89","469","526","48","21"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheTypn/recommended/364360/","TheTypn","Typn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheTypn/","110 products in account","So I should start off by saying that I have little to no knowledge of Warhammer Fantasy. However, I have a combined total of 1400+ hours in Total War games.\n\nOkay, so if you're reading this I suppose you're on the fence about this Total War game. Let me list off my experience thus far:\n\n***NOTE: This is purely opinion and experience****\n\nMultiplayer\n\nCooperative Campaign\n\nDay one of release was a mess as always with Total War-- however, besides a few hours of waiting to get into a server with my brother, I had quite the fun experience. Unlike Rome II or Attila even day one we had no crashes, freezes or major bugs. Perhaps it was due to my appreciation of a new title or my absence of attention, but I can honestly say I experienced no major problems in online play. In fact I'd most definitely recommend to play with a friend as it brings a new challenge of keeping each other alive or going head to head to bring each other down.\n\nOverall my experience with Warhammer Multiplayer so far is a resounding positive.\n\nCampaigns\n\nWith there only being four factions (five if you preordered or bought in the first week-- which I recommend because it increases the game size by 20%). And myself played or playing 3 of them at the moment I'll give a short summary of what I thought of them.\n\nTL;DR All of them are super unique. Vamps are OP, Empire is super tough (fun late game), greenskins fun, dwarfs (from what I witnessed in co-op) fun as well, and chaos pretty bland.\n\nEmpire\n\nAll right my first campaign single player! For my leader I chose Karl Franz, who I now debate as the worse of the two options because of the lack of empire magic early on. Now, I'm not one to go and min max armies and income, and I'm usually a pretty good player overall, but dang Empire was one of my toughest starts by far. The units you start off with are really just pitiful in a comparative nature, and Reiksguard starting off are you're savior early game (if you chose the Emperor). This is one of the many reasons I struggled early on. That and the fact you start at war with three factions in the beginning while also surrounded on all sides make this annoying. As well as no way to get certain units without military support one city level higher than the military buildings themselves.  Overall, I considered it fun late game and with my brother but really boring with battles, diplomacy and constant war declarations early on only to get super awesome stuff later.\n\nSimply put, they make it difficult to play for no reason.\n\nVampire Counts\n\nHow can I describe the onslaught that was my vamp run.\n\nI'll put it like this-- by turn 45 I owned half or more of the empire and could support end game level incredible armies.\n\nChallenge didn't exist with the god general Carstein and unlimited amount of dead you got from army wiping just simply from number advantage. I never once found myself needing to look at stats purely because I could auto resolve on very hard just because of the sheer number of units.\n\nOverall I found this faction way too overpowered in the campaign (as the player).\n\nGreenskins\n\nI won't go into detail with greenskins because I just found their position fun. Got to leave some excitement if you get the game. I found myself in constant battle and from what I've read up on about Warhammer that's exactly what greenskins did. Units, dialog, mounts, quests all of it was exciting in some way. I haven't completed this play through yet but it really makes me want to hop on this game to play even more.\n\nPlay greenskins if you want just a fun experience.\n\nDwarfs\n\nWon't leave an opinion because I've not played them myself. From what I saw with my brother they were fun as well.\n\nChaos\n\nWon't leave an opinion because I've not played them myself. From custom battles they seem okay and roster seems amazing, but other reviews of them lead me to believe they are bland. I'd probably recommend them to anyone who liked Attila.\n\nThoughts on the Game\n\nPros\n-New fantasy setting\n-FANTASTIC soundtrack\n-Unique factions\n-WAAAAAAAGH\n-Leaders are really unique and cool\n-AI definitely improved from prior games\n\nCons\n-Brettonia is incomplete and not playable in the beginning\n-Some non player factions aren't fleshed out\n-Diplomacy hasn't changed at all\n-Not many victory conditions\n\nI would put that not many factions, however, I find each faction so unique that it's a whole new experience each play through.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend this game, it really is unique for total war. I supported the whole idea of this game just because of he breakaway of the purely historical games.

Victory came for me but at a hefty cost as I lost almost as many warriors as my enemy. They retreated back to the shack made of rotten wood and rusted metal that they called a town, while I stayed in my territory, licking my wounds, replenising my crippled army. I reviewed the Dwarvern Emo diary, AKA The Book of Grudges, to see what I could do to rally the hordes of crybaby dwarf citizens at my command. I readied myself to take the Orc settlement, just a few more turns to gather my strength... The next turn, a goblin army from a neighbouring region charged at my army's flank, ruining my plans. "Why didn't I go back to safety of my stronghold!" I said, chastising myself. I was now being attacked by a healthy, rested and eager Goblin army, baying for my blood, meanwhile the Orc army that I had defeated, also joined the fray.\n\nOutnumbered almost 3 to 1, I started the battle, positioning my troops at the crest of a hill, having plenty of time to maneuver as the sheepish Goblin army moved to join their wounded Orc allies. I waited. A line of Thunderers and another of Quarrellers stood in line, ready to shoot. Victory was unlikely, but maybe I could pull off a miracle. It was then that the miracle presented itself. I noticed the Orc Warchief at the front of their lines, severely wounded from our last encounter... If I could just take him out, the low morale of the Orcs and Goblins might shift in my favour.\n\nThe warchief entered my range and my Quarrellers unleashed their crossbow bolts. As he came even closer, my Thunderers opened up. It was then that the Warchief dropped dead; his body riddled with crossbowbolts and shot. It was as if the ancestors themselves smiled upon the bravery of my men and smote my enemies down for their hubris.\n\nThe remains of the Orc army instantly routed, charging from the field. I turned the eagerness of my ranged infantry to the more pressing matter of the Goblins. Goblin spearmen charged at my wounded men, enveloping them in a sea of green slimey flesh and primitive spears. They fought hard, standing their ground and finally got the edge again when the Slayer king himself jumped into the tide, immediately flinging half a dozen tiny goblin bodies down the hill. Still, I was heavily outnumbered. Desperate times call for desperate measures. As my Longbeards and Slayers kept the goblins occupied, I marched my ranged units down the hill towards their Goblin shaman who sat toward the back of their ranks. I opened fire with all the fury my men could muster, wounding the fragile leader. Being on the outskirts of the mob, the Slayer king met with the Shaman, leader to leader. As it turns out, a Goblin Shaman is no match for the King of the Slayers, and soon he fell to his axe. With their leaders gone, the Goblins began to fall in droves. They soon realised that it was hopeless as the Thunderers  and Quarrellers joined the fight, supplementing their arsenal for the shield on their backs. The rest of the Goblins fled; my men cut some of them down, but alas, it was a luxury that Dwarves, being much slower than Goblins, would not be able to take advantage of. It didn't matter, against the odds, we had won.\n\nWith two of their leaders dead, I felt satisfied that we had done enough damage  for one day and I easily occupied their settlement, replacing wood and rusted iron with stone and steel. I nestled in my new settlement, my men gaining much needed respite and reinforcements. I crossed another whiney errand (read: grudge) from my Emo book of dark poetry, assured in the knowledge that the Dwarves wouldn't drown me in their tears - at least not for another turn or two.\n\nI love this game.","May 24","true","65.3"," 713 of 856 people (83%) found this review helpful 307 people found this review funny","83","713","856","307","17"

For newer players let me just say that this game is a perfect starting point if you are looking to get into the series.\n\nPROS:\n-Campaign: I was always detracted from finishing Long Campaigns before - it was often grindy and finishing was just a formality. The restrictions to settling in this game actually help with this. It allows you to interact with other Factions as friends/foes rather than "future property of me". I was skeptical with this change but it gave a refreshing amount of direction to my campaign. That said, I am still going to use the upcoming conquer the map mod, but perhaps not all of the time. The Chaos event was fun in a way that wasnt also annoying (I'm looking at you Rome II IA civil war).\n\n-Combat: Combat is meaty. Cannons sound amazing, lords smack away soldiers like Sauron from Lord of the Rings, unit design and animations utilize the fantasy setting very well. Map Landscapes are varied and gorgeous. In all, I found myself using auto resolve less than my first campaigns in other titles. UI and control is closest to Attila.\n\n-Difficulty: There was an artifical difficulty on easy/normal in the last titles where you would have hordes of one-city factions with an army or two complicating your movements. In this game, Confederations are usually established by the midgame, allowing much more epic fights with much more balanced enemies. The easy/normal difficulties have never been more accurate. I have yet to test higher but I've watched HeirofCarthage (Hard/VH) and LegendofTotalWar (Legendary) and I can say that challenge is alive in full force. You can take a look at thier LPs to be the judge.\n\n-Depth: 'Generals' and 'Agents' have a depth that was previously only achived with mods like TTT. If you play Chaos and want to field lots of armies, you might choose to be a better leader for marauder units since you will have a lot of them. If you play Dwarves like me, you can make your general better at setting up underground ambushes for all of those pesky orks. This can only get better with expansions and mods. The faction leader quests involve epic scripted battles that were tons of fun.\n\n-System: I would be shocked if I had to wait over 10 seconds for an end turn in my first campaign. Most were ~5 seconds. I have an i5-4690 with the game loaded on an SSD. With a GTX 970 I was able to run on ultra with only a few frames dropped here and there. Though not everyone plays with my system this is a 'Pro' since on the same system, both Rome II and Attila run much much worse.\n\nCONS:\n-Towns: Towns have not have a lot of depth since Empire (maybe Shogun 2). Besides a few regions that have a special building chain to encourage you to think, you will very quickly find the right buildings to build in your 6/4/4/4. I think this was the intent. I suggest a return to population and more ways to affect region wealth outside of buildings and building modifiers. Popluation/taxes/trade/wealth made Empire one of my favorites despite the awful combat and AI. Food and Sanitation are gone. I don't mourn thier passing but it does leave less to manage.\n\n-Agents: It is difficult to keep up with the AI in terms of agent levels. In the early game (on easy) the AI was fielding lvl 11 agents while I had lvl 4. Success against AI agents was in the range of 20% with an equal amount to injury. Enemy agents would succeed often and kill my own making it ever more diffucult to catch up. Deployment grants almost no exp (a level every 8 turns or more). It seems the game wants you to utilize army placement but even then I could not keep up. I think the numbers just need a small revisiting to fix this issue. You get agent spammed less but your agents feel about as useful in campaign action as in Empire Total War (pretty bad).\n\nI am happy this review is done because I really want to start another campaign. This game is a must buy for TW veterans or fans of the Warhammer IP as it fits with the gameplay so well.\n\nTLDR; Yes - buy.","May 25","true","94.1"," 148 of 171 people (87%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","87","148","171","6","3"

A good return to form after Rome II and especially the factional blandness of Attilla . Runs reasonably well, comparable to Rome 2, but don't expect to run it at ultra 60fps unless you have topend hardware, and even then it may be iffy. AMD users supposedly should get better performance due to hardware based Asynch Compute when running in DX12, but as an Nvidia user I can't confirm that.\n\nLoading times are a bit iffy, but I won't say for sure as I am running a budget harddisk, so it may simply be the system. However if you were the type to play Divide Et impera mod for R2, it is much faster, but that's more a comment on DEI than TW:W. Conversely, turn times are perhaps the fastest they've been since Mideval 2. And difficulty. This is perhaps one of the most ball busting TWs yet, which some may find good, others less so.\n\nLastly MP. I have no idea how the MP is because the servers are completely hammered right now because of launch, but sadly from previews I can say it is more of R2 and Attilla style MP than the Avatar Conquest of Shogun. There is a mod on the workshop that moves the secondary Lord to a new faction of the same race, and I highly reccomend it for co-op play so you can both be the same race however.\n\nEdit: No idea why, but texture detail seems to have a massive framerate impact. Dialing it down from Ultra to High made it so I could run at a decent 40-50fps in battles with an aging GTX 760. Probably the first time I've had texture detail severly effect framerate as opposed to just causing loading issues or ram issues.\n\nEdit 5/26: The game has been out 51 hours and I've logged 30. That should sum it up.","May 24","true","127.7"," 630 of 837 people (75%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","75","630","837","19","9"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LegendofTotalWar/recommended/364360/","LegendofTotalWar","LegendofTotalWar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LegendofTotalWar/","128 products in account","Product received for free\n\nI'm giving this a positive review because I strongly believe that Total War: Warhammer is better than Total War: Attila. This game isn't perfect and there are things that bother me about it. . However, I have enjoyed playing it. I did receive it for free from Creative Assembly but I am under no obligation to give it a positive review. Everything I list here will be my honest opinion. There will be a link to my youtube channel down the bottom if you want to view some campaign gameplay. Some people have had issues with performance but I haven't had any, and my computer is a potato. I've had 3 crashes in 350 hours\n\nPros:\nCharacters - The bulk of the gamplay depth improvements in the series comes down to how much detail has been put into the different Lords and Heroes and their skills and equipment. Unlike in recent Total War games I actually cared about my generals once they reached a certain level and their skills massively impacted on the strength of your army. Their traits, skills, and equipment is the most impressive part of the game.\nBattles - Whilst the AI still of course can be outsmarted without too much difficulty, they do seem quite a bit more aggressive and intelligent over previous titles. There will be times in which they utterly fail at an attack, but that's to be expected.\nFactions - Whilst clearly not all Warhammer races are currently in the game, whether or not they are being developed I don't know, but the ones that are in there are diverse and interesting. They have distinct play styles, difficulties, and challenges.\nDifficulty - The difficulty settings seem fairly accurate. Easy is a cake walk. Legendary requires some serious skill and knowledge of the game. This is probably the most challenging Total War game since Shogun 2.\nNo longer a grind - Total War Attila was a massive grind to complete. Even on easier difficulties you'd be stuck fighting hundreds of repeditive battles to get to the finish. The campaign in this game can be finished much faster, but still have the same level of challenge condensed into a shorter time frame. That doesn't mean you can't have long campaigns either. There is usually stuff to do after you've defeated Chaos.\nSound Track - Although I've stated many times that Jeff Van ♥♥♥♥ is the master for Total War soundtracks, this is by far Richard Beddow's best work for Total War. He hit the nail on the head in my opinion.\nThe Chaos Invasion - Truly terrifying the first time you go up against it. The game doesn't really start until Archaon shows up with his 7 doom stacks. They are very difficult to defeat on the field on equal terms.\nMagic - Whilst clearly in need of some balancing patches, the design and ideas behind the various spells and skills is masterful. It's not something you can ignore - unless you're playing as Dwarfs.\n\nCons\nSettlements - Detail has almost been stripped bare from campaign settlement details. We've had the terrible 6-4-4 building slots in Total War for a while now and its still as boring and annoying as when they introduced it in Rome 2. I don't mind regions being grouped together into provinces, but each region just has barely and depth to it any more. Income is completely static and there are no civilian populations present at all. I miss the days in which your city had 20,000 people living in it and the city was trading with nearby cities via roads and ports, and the amount of money you made was determined by the number of people, the quality of roads/ports, and the amount of resources.\nTrade - It can't get any more bare bones than this now. It's actually to the point where if you don't bother establishing trade agreements, you'll be fine without them, even on Legendary Difficulty.\n\nAnything I thought was a bit meh should be fixable with patches and mods, so I didn't feel the need to list them here.\n\nOverall I rate this game 80/100 and would call it a solid addition to the Total War franchise. Definitely a must have for any hard core fans of the series.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/4JCTVjCmXwU","May 24","true","689.8"," 259 of 334 people (78%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","78","259","334","15","25"

This game gave me black screen for the opening cinematic because i was using nvidia card, this has been fixed with the game's hotfix and now game runs fine. there were 3 crashes over 133 hours of game play when i tried to swap units between armies. it was annoying. then i realized one crash every two days for a week old game is not a huge issue. at least it was not like rome 2, which was ...well, u know.\n\nWhat i like about this game is that all the units from different races are not reskins of each other. unlike shogun 2, all the units of different races has their own stats and attributes. i learned this the hard way when my armies which gave me decisive victories towards one race suffered crushing defeats at the hands of another race. - i could not mop the whole map with the same army composition. however, it could be the legendary setting since we suffer a huge penalty and the AI gains huge advantages, even the slightest difference causes major set backs. i was forced to go indepth in understanding each races' units before creating a spesific army for each of them. the economy of races are also done differently, which is a cool thing.\n\nWhat i didn't like is the multiplayer. it is bare bones. the set up for multiplayer game feels like it is from the 90s. they could learn a lot more from shogun 2 where they had clans, conquest map, smart auto matchmaking and the coolest of all is creating your own avatar and equipping him with gears which drop after a battle is done. each item has it's own stats and completing a particular set would give extra stats. i had expected this from day 1 for warhammer since they had it in shogun 2.\n\nWhat surprised me is that the AI seems to be quite smart. i had to fight a battle since i got outmanevoured by the AI, AI had a huge army with weak warboss (orc's general), while i had a battered army with experienced warboss. i had thought that i could try to win this battle by killing the AI's warboss with mine and the rest of his army would rout. when the battle started, that warboss did something no greenskin had done - he stayed way back and did not engage me in melee. that cupking coward. my army was wiped out, my warboss dead and his gear looted.\n\nWhat didn't matter to me is the graphics. im running on a budget card......while the graphics aren't top notch but still it looked good when i zoomed in using the cinematic mode. when you have to fight and command your army on the battlefield, things like units details or grass details becomes negligible. i switched to cinematic mode two times on battles  that i knew i would definately win - i wish that i had a high end gpu so i could watch the units in action.\n\nbottomline. this is a fantasy total war. there is no history to follow other than from the lore of warhammer. there is no tetsudo formation and such, however, units with shields automatically raise up their shields under missle fire, this blocks 30% of incoming fire for orcs boyz, while the goblins, having smaller body and could cover their limbs better, could block 50% of missle fires, provided that they are facing the correct direction. i think this automation is convinient and done in part so there would be less micomanagement due to the fact that our attention would be shifted to focus on casting magic and activating magical hero gears. i believe only players who like both total war and warhammer lore would truly enjoy this game.\n\nim not sure if i should make amends with my girlfriends or start a dwarf legendary campaign.","May 30","true","195.8"," 202 of 258 people (78%) found this review helpful 102 people found this review funny","78","202","258","102","14"

Surrounded by orcs, dwarfs and rebellious empire factions that all want to wipe you out!\n-Easy to manage your towns when you get to grip with the new set up.\n-Hard difficulty is actually Hard, i've had to restart 4-5 times due to making silly errors and getting punished by surrounding factions.\n\nLastly Cons and Pros imo\n--Pros--\n-Smart AI when playing on hard and above (haven't tried on Normal or Easy), if you declare war on an AI to your east, expect opportunist rival factions surrounding you to declare war on you and try to grab land whilst your armies are nowhere to be seen.\n-Graphics are amazing and the game is well optimized.\n-All factions are different and suit a different play style! (obviously).\n-Ease to join friends games (steam overlay actually works to invite and join friends).\n\n--Cons--\n-As empire when you unlock a new unit, e.g. you start off with 'spearmen' and unlock 'spearmen with shields', there isn't an option to upgrade the base unit to the upgraded like in previous total war games, you have to dismantle your army and re-recruit the ugraded units. Not sure if this is intentional or a bug?\n-Tutorial for non experience total war players can be a bit underwelming, doesn't really go in to a lot of detail when it comes to hero skills and town management.\n-Bretonnian units and bases are in the game but aren't a playable faction at the moment on the campaign map. (ye ok i'm a bretonnian fanboy).\n\nIf your new to Total War games start off by playing on Easy or Normal, if your experience with Total War games get the difficulty cranked up and have fun :) Hope this helps!","May 25","true","54.6"," 183 of 251 people (73%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","73","183","251","6","2"

For the first time in a decade of total war games, I can say that I've not had game breaking issues and bugs, which is strange to say and makes me wonder what i missed, going by past experience, but I've got to hand it to CA for delivering a very well built game. Performance on my GTX 780 on (mostly) Ultra is also pretty good. IT also looks pretty good for what it is, though there are some minor points to be made regarding animations and ground textures.\n\nAs for how well the warhammer lore is implemented... well, it's pretty bloody phenomenal. It feels like Warhammer fantasy, and each of the factions plays VERY different, which is also the biggest draw of the title.\n\nThe constant surprises of new encounters, new mobs and new ways to counter them keeps the combat very fresh time and again, and makes the campaign very re playable with different races as they are VERY different with each having their own set of restrictions and special attributes (Vampires don't have ranged combat, Dwarves don't use magic, etc...).\n\nAnother cool implementation is the additional of Hero units & useful generals. These used to hang back and not do much for fear of losing them... now, with their own skill trees and upgrades and everything else, they are in the front lines and fighting the fight as an integral part of your army.\n\nThe rest of the gameplay is as you'd expect from a Total war game. Build castles, upgrade buildings and recruit armies. Trade, diplomacy, espionage are still here and no better or worse than before.\n\nOne issue i do have with the game is how slow combat feels, and while the game has various "speeds" you can toggle on and off on the fly, it still feels pretty sluggish. Also, the controls over your army in terms of formations, positioning and re-aligning is pretty limited.\n\nOveral a VERY solid addition to the Total War series and a very good adaption of the warhammer fantasy setting. Very much a good title.","May 24","true","30.0"," 474 of 704 people (67%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","67","474","704","18","10"

Unfortuntely, the last TW game that I was satisfied with was Rome Total War, the first one.\n\nEmpire Total War felt like a prototype rather than an actual game, suffering from some nasty bugs, silly AI (much more silly than normal) and horrible performance optimisation.\n\nShogun TW was decent, yet limited in scope and play. It's main flaw was limited replay value. Shogun 2 was popular and score a lot of points with the fanbase, but I absoloutely hated its cheating blatant AI which was more apparent this time round and enemy agent spams (something that Warhammer suffers from at the moment sadly).\n\nRome 2: Total War had to be one of the franchises biggest launch disappointments. A lot of the issues got fixed by the time Empire edition came around, but by then it was too late. Rome 2 has a bad interface, terrible politic mechanics and mundane boring micromanagement features such as the leveling up of your leaders, which ended up becoming less of a chore in Warhammer.\n\nThe Total War series has been on a losing streak since Rome Total War, trying to recapture the magic that the iconic R:TW is known for. Until now...\n\nWarhammer Total War has finally taken the mantle as the best Total War game since Rome, and sits loftly on its throne, goading and chiding all its previous titles like an angry Thorgrim Grudgebearer reading through his Grudgebook.\n\nThankfully, the reputation for the Total War series has been salvaged, one less grudge to be concerned about. Warhammer is not only a solid release - minus the few remaining bugs - but its also has solid performance, and a solid stable multiplayer that I've been enjoying far too much.\n\nRight away its easy to see that Creative Assembly have poured their hearts and souls into this title. They clearly love the Warhammer Universe and have done it great justice. As a fan of Warhammer, its lore and a current active GM for Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay, I would be the first to jump down their throats if they messed up this title as its very close to the heart, and its good to know that they have done it justice.\n\nNow, some minor gripes do remain, mostly lore ones: The colours of most of the state troops are wrong for the various Empire provinces, as are the appearance of some of the Elector Counts, I'm looking at you Boris Todbringer!\n\nYet these are just a drop in the ocean, and issues like these can be readily fixed by mods and such.\n\nLeveling up skills of your leaders was a complete chore in Rome 2, uninteresting, annoyingly mundane and full of micromanagement. However, in Warhammer Total War, all that has changed. You still level up your heroes and leaders, but the skill tree interface, rather than smacking you in the face and shoving it in the mud like the previous total war game, here it treats you kindly and you know what your looking at. Not only that, but the skill trees (and the tech trees) are done really well, full of detail and surprisingly full of content, with each skill tree becoming different depending on the hero.\n\nRome 2's dull micromanagement system (and its awful attempt at politics) is all done away with for a much more favoured approach of retaining depth and complexity yet keeping it simple to use.\n\nFrom the interface to the way everything just feels 'right', TW Warhammer certainly earns its place as the top franchise title. My only regret is that they didn't call it Total Warhammer... *Sigh*\n\n\nThis game also has the most potential of any other previous title, as there is so much they can do to not only improve the game, but also to expand upon it. With two HUGE new standalone (urgh, standalone...) expansions on the way, and dlc (and FLC) on the way for the first title, this is an exciting time to be a Warhammer fan.","May 27","true","60.6"," 226 of 325 people (70%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","70","226","325","23","18"

Why are you reading this? Go play the game already.\n\nIs the game good for everyone else? Yes, it's a solid game imho but bear in mind that my opinion is biased since I'm a huge fan of both Total War and Warhammer.\n\nTechnical and grapicsFirst off, in regards to launch problems I'm aware there are some but I have not experienced any except for hanging during battles twice in 30 hours playtime. I'm playing on a 2 year old(top level at that time) gaming laptop and everything runs fine on medium/high settings. The grapics are great even on this settings and honestly I can't wait to get to play it on a non laptop 1080 GTX in Ultra setting later this summer when I'll be upgrading.\n\nBe warned that there are technical problems for some people so you might want to check up on that before buying the game. If you're unsure you can try it for two hours(which is definitely sufficient) to determine if it works. If it doesnt simply refund the game.\n\nThe BadI like starting off with the bad and ending with the good. Of course there are bad things with the game and some of them are subjective while others might be objective. Many of these are subjective of course and people like playing the game differently.\n\nAgents on the map are fairly OP imo and agents cannot be specced properly into defensive roles when embedded into an army. I prefer running my agents in my armies but the enemy pretty much spam me with tons of agent actions every turn. There seems to be no defensive bonus for embedding your agents into armies which is wierd considering they take up a unit slot after all. The AI also never use the embedding feature at all. I never once faced a warrior priest on the actual field for instance, instead they run around like crazy on the campaign map. Somewhat immersion breaking. The same total war agent ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t is still around where your agents got ♥♥♥♥♥♥ chances and the enemies seems to cripple you a lot.\n\nBalancing wise I felt like Orcs needed a heavy nerf when playing as the Empire, I basically lost to an army of 50% archers since they just ran away and I didnt even have access to cavalry yet so I had one unit of Empire Knights that actually lost to the archers after a while.(At least the AI seems competent) Archers is not a problem at all if you're playing Chaos though and only recruit shield units. Which is how I solved this since there is nothing on this earth I hate more than enemy archers(subjective opinion ;)). I have however heard more people confirming that Orks seem a bit OP in the campaign. Especially when playing on VH/Legendary. I also dislike Orks as a faction so bear in mind I may be biased here.\n\nThere are tons of small things that go in here like how hard it actualy is to maintain chaos corruption in provinces that you moved way past and are at the top of the map. Corruption should not decrease in provinces that you already passed. Maybe a mechanic of it spreading from the Chaos Wastes and downward together with your lords as they move would be appropriate here.\n\nDiplomacy is as usual very badly done, they should have worked something better out between the various Empire factions and the Chaos-Norsca relation, where the AI of Norscans doesnt seem to know how to support you properly on the map even if you set coordination targets.\n\nTheir idea of underworld travel is a lazy prospect at best. I'd have expected a real underworld where the map shifts much alike Heroes of Might and Magic so this is a disappointement. What I'd like to see are select entrances to the underworld thus giving us more fun choke points as mountains either needs to be passed below or through sparsely places mountain passes. Currently, mountains do not feel like a hindrance or change of environment at all. Of course, non dwarves/skaven/goblins should have a penalty for traversing in this "real" underground I'm mentioning.\n\nMany obvious places for DLC whoring. Hopefully some of this will be free.\n\nThe Good\nThe AI is actually pretty solid this time around and I have not found them doing stupid stuff that were standard in previous games. Siege battle AI is solid when they are on the defense and they actually try and defend their walls properly. This is a huge plus.\n\nSiege battles are remade and made less into a waiting game and more engaging which is good in my opinion. Towers now have range over the entirety of the map pretty much but with a limited fire angle making it possible to avoid them by moving past the small angle or getting in close. Towers are pretty strong as well so it actually feels like defenders have an advantage. Bear in mind I have not played a single defensive seige since I've been playing Chaos and only a small bit of Empire.\n\nBoth battles and campaign are improved upon and I find myself fighting more battles than in previous games. The Campaign map is really nicely done. They actually put a lot of effort in improving the very core gameplay.\n\nFactions diversity is amazing and the factions feel as unique as they should. There are a fair variety of units and I hope more are added. I'd also like to see some more variants of Empire state troops.\n\nMatters of TasteIt takes a very very long while to get the top tier units. I got Chaos Knights at around turn 160 and probably 25 hours played. I might just be bad though. ;)\n\nSiege battles as mentioned above. They also removed minor settlements completely and these battles now play out on the battle map. I like field engagement so for me this is in the green slightly but I still like the immersion of actually seeing the town close by. Would be cool if there was some town environments but the battle was still more in the shape of a field battle.\n\nPowerful Lords. For me this is a big plus since RP options are so massively expanded but for some of the more hardcore historical TW fans this will be an obvious negative since they dislike the fact of one man being as powerful as 100. I do wonder how it plays out with the lords on smaller unit sizes though, I am playing on Ultra unit size as a total war game should be played.\n\nThings seems to take time and the campaign pace seems slower than previous TW games, for me this is a good thing.\n\nSummaryThere are some good and some bad aspects with the game. It's a bit of an uncut gem at the moment but most problems with balancing can be solved with mods of course.\n\nThe game is fun and I believe total war fans will like it since it plays like a TW game with some modifications. For Warhammer fans this is a must have, you need it! It's the Mark of Chaos game we all wanted. Even though I actually liked MoC this game is obviously a lot better.\n\nI personally enjoy the game despite some shortcomings. If you're looking for a perfect game and you're not really that interested in strategy games or fantasy you should probably just go buy the latest cash cow franchise FPS game(CoD). But if you're into fantasy and strategy games I'd highly recommend the game. I'm also very confident it will be improved upon as we see more factions and playability added into the game.","May 25","true","132.2"," 106 of 142 people (75%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","75","106","142","6","4"

They stripped down the tech and social trees to stream line the battles. There are quests to get geared up and equipable and swappable retainers. The whole thing seems way more like a battle intensive RPG set in the Total War engine, which is why I bought it.\n\nThe graphics look great, with diverse little toons amongst the units. They yell, they fight, they die, they get swept through the air and rag dolled by trolls. You can even cast magic and watch them all fry like pork sausages.\n\nThe game itself runs good too, I have currently played 3 hours over a remote connection with no issues. There was a point on the very first splash screen where I waited for about 10 minutes before the intro started. I thought it was broken but, it started eventually :/\n\nI don't know if multiplayer is working for anyone else but, it crashed my game the two times I clicked Multiplayer so.... that's definitly a bad mark for the game right now. If you wanted to play this game for the multiplayer, hold off till they fix it. (Fixed now)\n\nMany people have said that it black screens or constantly crashes on them. I haven't experienced that yet, outside of attempting multiplayer. This game runs on my low end bare bones laptop that i'm remoted into from a crapy Dell. I give it two thumbs up for optimization. Now all I want is an Army Painter so the Warhammer Theme would be complete.","May 24","true","56.2"," 242 of 357 people (68%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","68","242","357","11","1"

A step up from its predecessors and a step behind what we had hoped for. This game needs to be good and needs to be well received I believe for the Total War franchise to continue on.\n\nPROCONNERUS!\nI'm happy the AI doesn't derp it's way into sieges, but the cities are simpler so it feels like a bit of a trade off especially with auto-ladders though its realistically the only solution to the AI's general sad panda face at the prospect of going up walls.\nThe AI seems to be able to competently handle its new unit types, I was particularly impressed with Chaos's use of Marauder Cav and Tundra wolves for skirmishing. However, the AI also seems to favour the "If we engaged in a line today, we're certainly going to engage in a line tomorrow!"\nThere's quite alot of love thats gone into the character models from what I've seen, the art work is certainly on point. Though who ever thought Thorgrims AngryLazyBoyChair3000 was a going solution is a bit well, daft.\nI haven't seemed to inherit many of the technical issues people are going on about right now. The con part of it is that theres a huge ♥♥♥♥♥torm over the technical soudness and optimisation of this game. Business as Usual for TW :P\nCON-CONNERUS Dont touch multiplayer in early days right now, its broken af. Though I suspect server load and GLORIOUS COMRADE AUSTRALIAN INTERNET is to blame.\nNo RPG style Shogun 2 general avatar for multiplayer. Game was basically made for that style of multiplayer and would have shined with it.\n\nAll in all, this game is worth the dollars, my hip pocket regret hasn't burned through my trousers so thats a good thing.

The UI is asthetically pleasing and very intuitive and is very customisable going from quite bare-bones to very informative, allowing you to change it up in-battle. As always the Total War Wiki is there for further information. The Campaign map and it's UI is also intuitive, full of options and necessary information and again, asthetically pleasing.\n\nMoving on to gameplay the fantasy setting brings a new breath of life, increasing replayability and bringing new exciting battle mechanics. Although there are a lack of races to play as (4/5) each faction is VERY different to play as. In this case less is more. The battles themselves are fast-paced, full of actions and awe-inspiring set pieces. There is a lot going on in the battlefield which changes the game up and forces you to bring new tactics to the table. The Campaign itself is very fun and 120 odd turns in is still very exciting and thrilling. The arrival of chaos changes everything where enemies forget their differences and band together to fight the insueing tide of evil. The arrival of chaos does not mean a boring, survive as long as you can but instead brings an exciting new chapter of stemming the stream of the end times.\n\nOverall the game handles the fantasy setting very well, magic is fun and not at all op is feared pre-release and the game is better optimized than Rome II and Attila even for NVIDIA systems. Total War: Warhammer is a match made in heaven and brings a new lease of life to both franchises.

Been a fan of total war since the original Medieval, and own all of them except Attila. This game, while pretty with lots of cool Warhammer lore, is a step backwards.\n\nThe campaign map is even more simplified than Rome, the AI suffers from several deficiencies, first of which is an inordinate amount of attention on the player (Ork raiders bypassing weak AI settlements, sometimes several, to wreak havoc in your province). And again, an old problem has yet to be corrected, the ability of the AI to have MASSIVE armies with a single territory under their control. On higher difficulties, the AI is blatanly abusive of mechanics (It can outrun you and it knows it). The hero system is not very intuitive, nor is there much help on the matter.\n\nCombat has also suffered from over simplification. Gone are your unit formations (you only have two, misssle front, missle rear). Combat is also incredibly fast. It may be nitpicky, but I really liked zooming in on close combat and watching the models kick the tar out of each other in amusing ways. Now, units are destroyed and flee at such a pace as it makes enjoying the scene practically impossible. Elsewhere it has been mentioned that there is some sort of mechanic that buffs armies that have greater numbers than their foes. In the days of yore, a well thought out defense, making use of terrain, unit strengths, and cover meant you could outwit and defeat a much larger and better equipped force, or at least bloody their noses enough to slow them down. Now, if you are outnumbered, the battles are incredibly lopsided, no matter what you do. This mechanic plays in your favor as well. A small AI force can be routed almost instantly, and you will take minimal casualties. One final mention on battles, ranged weapons and artillery are DEVASTATINGLY accurate. Not only are they accurate, but they are an absolute menace, to you or the AI. Artillery can wipe out entire units long before they ever engage, and fire with accuracy that would make an olympic marksman green at the gills, regardles of cover.\n\nDiplomacy, while always the whipping child of Total War, has been oversimplified again. They were going a good direction with Empire and Shogun II, I was hoping they would refine it, but instead it has essentially returned to Medieval II, without the diplomat units. AI regions do not support each other, or seem to care that you are slaughtering their Bretonnian brethren while you trade with them and grant military access. Your allies bail on you at the first sign of invasion.  This is all run of the mill for the Total War Franchise, but the step backward in developement is a disappointment.\n\nThis is the first review I have ever written, but the disappointment in this game was quite disheartening. I love Total War, but this feels like a beta at best, and with some major internal mechanical flaws. I hope it gets better, but so far this is the only Total War game to let me down and feel like I wasted money.\n","May 25","false","7.8"," 691 of 1,151 people (60%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","60","691","1","26","64"

Music, art, voice acting, everything. Cavalry and army clashes have more CRUNCH to them than they used to. If you could run Attila and Rome 2, you'll run this even better. Battle AI is better. Campaign play is better because of optimized CPU usage, meaning no more 15 minute turns. Each faction is VERY different, not only in battle but how they play in campaign (i.e. Vampires get to corrupt mortal lands and start up covens to disrupt their public order, Orcs always have to be fighting or your armies kill each other, etc.)\n\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED.\n\nLong Verdict:\nPros\n-Five (Six in custom battle) Warhammer Fantasy armies, each lovingly detailed with different play mechanics\n-Great soundtrack\n-Campaign is extremely accessible, perfect for people who have never played Total War before\n-Campaign AI is more intelligent, no more of armies running between two points as you ruin their kingdom. They also back off when they see you have a strong defense\n-Very in depth magic system gives a new layer of strategy to battles\n-Customizable lords and heroes, choose their equipment and talents\n\nCons\n-Environmental destruction and fire effects have been severely downgraded from the spectacle they were in Attila\n-No unit formations (i.e. wedge formation for cavalry, spear walls, shield walls, etc.)\n-No more small settlement battles (and therefore no random civilian killing as your army moves in), all sieges happen in large and famous cities\n-No options to change the season, weather or time of day in battles\n\nMeh\n-Sieges are relegated to one corner of the city. I'm indifferent to this.\n-Due to Warhammer lore, diplomacy in campaign is somewhat limited in the kinds of interactions you can have with other factions. I'm indifferent to this. Very lore accurate that Chaos barbarians and Orcs would not come to humans with any sort of trade agreement.\n-You can't conquer whole map. Only the cities and provinces of your nemesis faction. Again, I don't care about this but perfectionists might.\n-I do miss the ability to choose ammo types for ranged units. Having one type of ammo for everything simplifies things however, leaving more time to micro for magic.\n\nFirst time I've finished a Total War campaign in a while.

I've been playing Total War games since the release of Rome I and I am a historian who for his daily work specializes in warfare and society in the ancient and medieval worlds. I have always been enamoured to the total war games and the innovative way in which they reworked historical contexts into techinical game design. I also have quite a long history in table top games ranging from WWII and Napoleonic era simulation to actual gamesworkshop franchises like The Lord of the Rings and last but not least warhammer. I can sum this particular game up in one sentence:\n\nTotal War Warhammer is an excellent rendition of the Warhammer universe but also a very flawed and unimaginative translation of Warhammer into the Total War franchise.\n\nGood warhammer: bad total war. I have never seen such a dumbed down version of total war in which all the positive gains from the previously two entries are just thrown away for no apparent reason other than the all mighty sanctity of high framerate,  processor performance and novice accessibility.  Battles lack tactical depth and option but either revolve into an illogical (from a warhammer perspective) rock-paper-scissor enagement or devolve into a close victory moshpit in which all the units gang around the surviving heroes or big 'bullet sponge" units. There are no formation options and the units themselves are much smaller than they previously were. With all the stat-capping and tracking in the campaign as well as in the rpg hero system you will never be quite sure what exactly won you the batlle in campaign battles. Was it your flawless flankmove or was it the stats themselves and all the buffs to your units? The army units themselves are fancy-looking but in terms of design immensely unimaginative. Spearmen are good against 'big units' but are apparently bad against mounted units. Forceful rock-paper-scissor for a tabletop game indeed, but not necessarily good game design. However, this is just one of the battle-and-unit system's many flaws.  I haven't even mentioned the balance between units themselves. In fact, the balance has never been this far off and bad collision models make these unbalances even worse. Units that are supposed to be stronger break through lines but are then automatically killed off because they gain a rear penalty while actually being engaged in a frontal encounter. It's absurd. And whereas in previous total war games a player with a weak army could, with proper tactical thinking and decision making, easily defeat players with a stronger army, in this game however it all comes down to either click-spamming your hero powers or manoeuvring your high damage and health units in massive moshpit battle which in no way resembles or deserves the tactical decisions and manoeuvres you made at the start of the battle:\n\nTactics do not count in this game, stats do.\n\nThe 4/5 factions this game counts are enjoyable in the first few hours. They are new of course, and have all sorts of fantastical units you remember from the board game. However after seeing these units a couple of days and having played the 4/5 factions in battles over and over again you will find out that the game promised much, but delivers little. It get's stale very quick when you only have 5 factions:\n\nThere is not much to discover after 10 hours of gameplay.\n\nAs for the campaign, there are a lot of positives. The warhammer universe is beautifully translated to the map itself and to the character development system. However the building and reseach chain is again quite simplified and not in a particularly good way. Restrictions of specific kind of buildings to particular locales have been around for some time. But in this game such restrictions have been standardized and have been made fundamental elements to the entirety of the building mechanism. Hence, such a design choice results in a rather tedious experience of clicking the end turn buttom in the hope you gain enough money (which is intentiously scarce anyway in this latest edition of total war) to built that 9000 building from your meagre 1500 annual income in order for you to finally built a unit which required 4 different buildings to recruit in the first place, one of which could only be built in the faction's capital! Furthermore new buildings, especially economically oriented ones, do not add significantly to your income nor is there a sensible means to control tax levels. This is of course meant to stimulate aggresive action on the campaign map to enhance your annual income. Armies gain loot, rewards and sack cities if necessary. But by making such aggresive income gathering a primary focus in the game's economy mechanics, it also for a large part throws out the economic planning so important in previous total war games. Planning that required some serious thought:\n\nThis game's economic infrastructure is flawed.\n\nAlso, the chaos corruption mechanic is a nice addition to the game, you slowly feel the forces of chaos getting closer to their goal: your destruction. But as opposed to it's vampire counterpart, is completely bugged and can on some occasions not even be brought down to zero level whatever effort you take. Temples, agents, you name it, but the corruption meter will always stay on the same level. When it comes to fighting the actual Chaos armies you will be up for some disillusion. In no way are these as strong as the fearsome Hunnic hordes from Total War: Warhammer's predecessor. They are simple push-overs which require no real effort to defeat at all:\n\nChaos is a push-over and definitely no Attila.\n\nHence Warhammer Total War might be an enjoyable experience for Warhammer fans or players who are not really interested in Total War mechanics in any case. For me, and many others, who have been with the franchise from the very beginning the game just does not deliver on it's primary function: Total War.\n\n6/10\n\nEdit:\n\nSome other quintessential gameplay mechanics featured in previous total war games missing from this game:\n\n1. Dynamic weather system (sometimes it rains in temperate zones, sometimes there is ash fall in vulcanic areas, and sometimes it snows in northern areas)\n\n2. Seasons (Winter never crosses the river, but I'm sure it's coming......some day)\n\n3. Naval mechanics,  naval construction, naval battles\n\n4. Combat animations and finish moves (always worked perfectly fine since Medieval II, slightly problematic in Rome II until patch 3 & 4, perfect in Attila Total War. Now completely absent from Warhammer. Only a few big monstrous feature kill animations)\n\n5. Religion (even though featured prominently in Warhammer tabletop lore, completely absent from the game)\n\n6. Faction politics (internal): the game only features inter-state politics, i.e. diplomacy, which itself is again dumbed down as compared to previous entries. For instance, it is impossible to make family alliences in this game. Furthermore, all your generals are law abiding citizens whose only worry is getting a tier higher in the rpg tree.\n\n7. Tax control. Just no.\n\n8. Food/income gathering (this quintessential dynamic between food production and income gathering fundamental for societies at war does not seem to exist in this particular game. They are structured separately for no apparent reason but to flesh out the building chain. In itself, food production does not produce food. Which is quite hilarious).\n\n9. Turn/date based objectives (you're in no hurry in Total War: Warhammer. You can click the end turn button as many times as you like without penalties)\n\n10. More than 5 factions. Just an example. This game, Warhammer, only includes 5 factions and one unplayable faction. Rome II featured many more factions, each being part of several unique civilizations: Carthage, Rome, Iberic, Celtic (continental), Celtic (Insular), Nomadic, Germanic, Illyrian, Dacian, Eastern, Hellenic, Anatolian, Thracian, Desert.","May 29","false","19.1"," 780 of 1,336 people (58%) found this review helpful 60 people found this review funny","58","780","1","60","41"

Chaos fanatics and abominations led by Archaon the Everchosen, the Three-Eyed King and favored son of Chaos, march ever-forward from the desolate North with a single goal set before them, to bring forth the end of the world in honor of the dark gods.\n\nEntire nations of men have fallen, Orks have been wiped out from the world, and the only thing standing against the tides of darkness is an uneasy alliance between the mountain Dwarfs and the undead legions of Sylvania... or at least it would be if the damnable Dwarfs didn't decide this was prime time to exact revenge for a trade dispute that occurred ages ago!\n\nAs I sat there watching my entire empire crumble I was left wondering if I should be angry the AI decided to essentially throw the entire campaign and condemn us all to eternal damnation, or genuinely impressed it managed to do exactly what the Dwarfs in Warhammer lore would do - seek revenge against anyone foolish enough to end up in their great Book of Grudges.\n\nThe Factions\nUnlike previous Total War where every faction only differs slightly from their neighbors the ones in Warhammer all share the same general idea of warfare, but are unique in their implementation.\n\nThe aforementioned Dwarfs (not a spelling mistake) mostly adopt a defensive playstyle as earning new enemies is way more trouble than its worth due to the entire campaign revolves around crossing out names from the Book of Grudges, which naturally means beating up anyone that ever slighted you.\n\nOrks on the other hand care little for defense and prefer to fight as often as possible. This is represented in-game through the fightiness meter that increases as you win battles and crush your enemies, but decreases if you lose battles or hide behind walls like some sort of a Dwarf. Instead of loosing troops as you constantly advance across the campaign map your numbers will slowly increase as long as you remain on the offense, eventually ending up with an entire army trailing your primary one, an army you don't have to pay in anything other than blood!\n\nThe Vampire Counts, my personal favorite race, don't rely on such silly things as archery, artillery, or even taking good care of their front-line troops. What they have instead is a nearly endless sea of corpses to drown their enemies in. Zombies, skeletons, and skeletal zombie dogs all serve as cannon fodder to hide your more powerful units, the various monstrosities that have been forcefully risen from the grave, and a surprisingly effective and diverse set of spectral cavalry that will tear through the enemy's defenses with ease. There is nothing quite like watching thousands upon thousands of zombies slowly shamble towards terrified defenders stuck within their burning cities.\n\nIf you're up for a somewhat standard Total War experience, however, the Empire is there to provide exactly that. Their troops mostly consist of peasants with halberds, entire legions of crossbowmen, and naturally, noble knights riding upon steeds of war. There's plenty of 'wierd' stuff out there as well, but these guys are your Total War classic.\n\nThe art of war\nIf you've ever played a Total War game then you know exactly what to expect. The battles are usually drawn-out affairs where good positioning, quick-thinking and tactics will win the day over pure brute force. The one big difference compared to the previous games in the series is the inclusion of magic, both in the defensive enhancements and tornadoes made out of pure fire!\n\nUnfortunately, most of these offensive spells are nowhere near worth their mana costs as they do rather meek amounts of damage and tend to move about the battlefield in a random fashion. It makes sense from a lore perspective as the mortal races tend to have trouble understanding the Winds of Magic, but from a gameplay standpoint this means you'll mostly be spending your mana on efficient, but extremely boring offensive/defensive buffs.\n\nThe normal AI, while clearly not a genius, did offer me enough of a challenge throughout the campaign to never make me feel like I was getting an easy win, though I was warned when I picked up my review copy that it was slightly overtuned pre-release, so your mileage may vary. The most important thing to note is that I haven't encountered any situations where the AI is so stupid it essentially throws away an easily won battle due to idiocy.\n\nHowever, I do have one big issue with the combat, and this comes down to the fact that many units in Warhammer look similar when viewed from above, especially the armored ones. In a battle between Black Orks and skeletal swordsmen its next to impossible to tell which side is winning without looking up the health bars, which themselves could be covered by other health bars! I would like to see an option that gives your units an outline in the color of your choice, as otherwise you have to rely on the pause button far too often, and that is something I don't consider very fun.\n\nCampaign\nThe biggest addition to the campaign is the inclusion of Legendary Lords, important heroes from the lore that usually take the role of generals in battles. The best part about them is that you get to slowly watch them ascend to power through various quests. These quests will appear periodically on the campaign map and usually force you to bring your entire army into hostile territory, with the carrot being a magical artifact of great power. You will start the battle with your entire army at the ready, while the opposition will get a pre-built force that might just be vastly inferior, or completely overpowered depending on when you decide to undertake the quest.\n\nWhile that can be a small issue I'm generally pleased with how the quests work, especially since they often give you an interesting scenario to fight in, one that you wouldn't get in any random battle, which is great as it manages to keep the game fresh. What doesn't feel fresh, and this is probably the biggest issue with Total War: Warhammer, is the fact that the end of the campaign is so repetitive. Almost every faction has the exact same goals:  destroy two opposing nations and stop the Chaos invasion, so no matter how unique your playthrough and faction are you're going to result doing the exact same thing as everyone else once you reach the end-game.\n\nAs far as the campaign map is concerned everything is more or less similar to the previous games so you will be building up your forces, creating new buildings to either generate income or recruit more units, research spells and abilities for your units, and so forth.\n\nThe only thing worth mentioning here is that the insanely stupid Diplomacy system is back again, and you will often have your allies decline your requests, only to instantly repeat back the same request but also pay you money to do so!\n\nClosing Thoughts\nTotal War: Warhammer is a crossover between two franchises I've enjoyed for many years now, and I'm delighted to say that it manages to be faithful to both sides, but most importantly, an actually enjoyable experience on its own. It has some clear flaws, especially when it comes to the generic campaign ending, terrible diplomacy system, and occasional performance woes, but even with all of that considered this is the most fun I've had with a Total War game.\n\nThe factions are unique, the units exciting, and the battles often a spectacle to behold, so I do hope the problems get ironed out through future patches and DLCs as this is a game I would love to keep coming back to for many years to come!\n\nIn order to keep things brief, and yes I realize how ironic that sounds, I've had to skip out on some aspects of the game, so if you're interested in my fully detailed review I welcome you to give it a look here: http://www.gamesear.com/reviews/total-war-warhammer-detailed-review","May 24","true","14.3"," 551 of 948 people (58%) found this review helpful 59 people found this review funny","58","551","948","59","42"

Even with Witch hunters with level 3 assassination or whatever it's called will take like 5 or 6 tries and 3,000 gold later to actually wound some ♥♥♥♥ sorcerer who's the same level as him.\n- Quests tend to pull you all over the map, so while they're really cool and a great feature they can get a bit frustrating at times.  For example, part of a quest demanded that I ally with Nordland - but despite fighting all their same enemies, being friends of their friends, and showering them with gifts, it took an extremely long time for them to accept anything.  I had the next part of the quest - acquire a Rocket Battery - done well before it.\n- No Navies\n\nYour mileage may vary:\n- General system still in place.  Whilst global recruitment addresses this, it feels more like a bandaid than a feature.  Maybe it's for the AI to prevent tiny stacks everywhere, but I greatly preferred being able to freely move units wherever I wish.  I've been told the reason is to focus on smaller, bigger battles but in my experience it just makes every battle the same 20v20 or 20v8.  A better option I think would be to allow more units in a single stack and re-introduce the interception mechanic from Empire.  But hey, I'm not a programmer so if it's better this way then so be it.\n- Campaign map though less tedious is becoming more and more simplified.  I'm not crying over sanitation and food, but I do miss the long extensive building chains in previous total wars (even just things like upgrading roads, it was cool seeing the province develop and looking at actual ships and wagons traveling between towns)\n\nAs a side note I do have to give praise to CA or Sega or whoever has been in charge of marketing it.  It was very transparent with live gameplay being easily available to watch (though I don't know why a bunch of random youtube streamers who don't play total war were given copies, I'd much rather just watch the CA group or actual TW streamers play).  It was also a good show of faith to move chaos from pre-order to 1st week free.  Whilst I despise early DLC stuff, it was still a nice gesture and shows they listen to the community.\n\nAll in all a great game, definitely recommend.","May 28","true","59.6"," 45 of 66 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","45","66","2","2"

It has been my favorite series since i was a teen. Epic sieges, and large scale tactical battles. Cant really go wrong right? Or Can you. Ive played 7 hours of this game, ive probably not experienced much in terms of events if there are any, or late game missions/unit trees. However, i feel the need to review this as ive seen huge leaps backwards from previous Total War Games.\n\nPros\n-Good Lore\n-Nice Variety of Missions\n-Love the individual lords, and customization of equipment, and skills\n-The campaign map is very pretty, and well done.\n-Have had no issues running the game on an older computer\n-Great potential for mods, such as a new lord of the rings mod.\n-Griffins, huge spiders, all sorts of amazingly done fantasy creatures/magic\n-Loving the magical element of the game, casting spells, riding griffins/dragons/deathclaws as your character progresses in levels.\n\nCons\n-While they have made beautiful cities in the backround, and off to the sides. The accesable part of the map is just a flat straight wall, with a gate in the middle, and a victory point in the back. Absolutely no tactical sense needed, just mass at the walls, and watch. In every single previous title castles, and forts had huge walls stretching all around the city. giving you the oppurtunity to attack from multiple points, or pick the weakest point, as well as use a wide variety of tactics after breaching the walls. Here, once you breach the walls, its over. few steps to the victory point and you have won.\n\n-Villages... When attacking a village theres not even one building representing the village. You just get a normal seemingly random battle map to fight on. In every single previous title there were buildings representing the village, and its development level.\n\n-Combat Animations, though im sure there will be mods later to help with this. Your beautifuly animated units, and great flying units basically just swing at the air, as soldiers have heart attacks all around them. In previous titles there were kill moves which made battles quite fun to watch. There are two sides to this story as i know alot of people were dissapointed in kill moves since they were introduce in empire. However, ive not seen one unit make contact or react to contact. just attacking/defending against the air. Rome 1's combat was prettier. Atleast occasionaly an axe would make contact with a unit.\n\n-4 playable factions. need i say more?\n\n-Naval Combat, seems to be gone. Havnt seen the option for any ships to be built, even though the oppurtunity is there, with large lakes, and a big ocean area.\n\n-Very limited tech/unit tree.\n\n-Artillery is so precise it may as well be a laser guided missile.\n\nConclusion: While this game is fun, and i dont regret buying it, I'm feeling very let down right now. They have dropped many of the parts of total war that i loved the most. To me this game seems like a step backwards in the series. Alot of things were left out. I can't think of any reasons why they were left out besides laziness. Battles seem extremely basic the AI does the same thing over and over. There are only 2 very simple formations. "Melee front" "Missile Front". Havnt seen any units with formation abilities, like shield wall, phalanx, you cant even tell your troops to go into Loose or tight formation to avoid ranged fire. Hopfully modders will get their hands on this game and save it. For me though, after 7 hours i find myself bored, and dissapointed.\nIf you are looking for an extremely casual game this is the game for you. If you like being challenged, and having to think during battles, or if you just enjoy watching the units fight it out i wouldnt recomend this one.\n\nOverall: 4/10","May 26","false","19.6"," 348 of 600 people (58%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","58","348","600","20","36"

I will add a TL;DR at the end.\n\nGameplay\nLike previous Total War games you will be constantly moving across a turn-based map improving your empire as you engage in RTS with battles crushing all those who resist your might.\n\nCurrently there are 4 base races and one DLC race to play as. Each race containing different playstyles and unique units creating a true sense of uniqueness that I have not seen in the franchise until now. I have currently played as the vampire counts which lack ranged units but make up for it insanely with no routing and great damage dealers. Even the warriors of Chaos shall fear me (Only a bit behind them in units since Archaon came out and boosted the numbers). So here is a kinda quick overview of the races.\n\nThe Empire - More classic oriented but superb cavalry\nThe Dwarfs -  Love to hold grudges (and have flamethrowers) so very revenge oriented\nGreenSkins - WAAAGH! (Fight or see the consequences)\nVampire Counts - Corruption spreads and while lacking ranged units are still insanely deadly (ha punny)\nChaos Warriors (DLC) - No settlements instead a horde whose only goal is to bring the end times, spread chaos, and kill all\n\nThe game is fun in both the turn-based state and RTS battle state. It also includes MAGIC!!!!!! (Magic can literally turn the tide of the battle insanely) Please help me, I have an addiction...\n\nGraphics/Sounds\nOK no denying you need a good pc/ gaming laptop to run this game, no denial there. I choose to run it on medium and do not have problems. As units go the designs of each unit is amazing! I personally love to look at my armies descend and destroy the empire.\n\nThe soundtrack... um I've been too busy fighting BUT, when I did hear it I thought it was rather nice.\n\nPros/Cons\nPros\n\n+ Unique Factions/Races\n+ Magic\n+ Good Launch (After the hotfix)\n+ Addicting\n+ Steam Workshop\n+ Multiplayer\n\nCons\n\n- Problems for some machines (not really a con BUT BE AWARE OF YOUR SPECS!!!)\n\nFinal Thoughts\nOh god help me... I come back from school, and I want to do work, I really do, but this game has other plans. It has grabbed me and forced me to devote myself to the Von Carstein family as everyone is slowly destroyed beneath my might. They may whine, they may try, but I fear nothing for I am fear itself.\n\nTL;DR\nIf you like Warhammer and Total War then you already own this game. Now this is the game for people who always wanted large-scale battles with a universe like LOTR or just any fantasy setting. Each Race/Faction is incredibly unique without sharing traits of others making each different one a fun experience. honestly this is the best Total War I have ever seen and If your PC/Laptop can run it and you like the idea or game at all, do yourself a favour and try it.","May 27","true","61.8"," 50 of 76 people (66%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","66","50","76","2","4"

However, TW:W had made an incredible leap forward with it's engine, story telling, and presentation.\n\nI love the difference between the races. Till now, factions were pretty much texture swaps with a few units getting bonuses and possibly a limited amount of unique units (that looked a lot like other units). Now we have different models, different animations, different army structures, different economies, different play styles. Completely unique units, the addition of spells and flying creatures shake up how we used to think about fighting in this game.\n\nThere's lots of game play additons here as well. AI that will actually keep their word and have different temperments. Massive amounts of personalization for your characters- abilies, equipment, and followers; you can change your equipments around and gift it to other heros or generals. Heros can now take part in battles.  The leveling system is a lot more incrimental giving you more choices. Your main faction leader has individual quests that unlock incredible items.\n\nCA also did a great job of sticking to the Games Workshop IP of the old world.

I was initially concerned by them going in the Warhammer direction, but my fears no longer exist.\n\nIt is such a nice feeling to send your hero unit into battle and watch the mayhem he creates. It reminds me a little bit of Sauron just destroying units, except it's not Sauron but Karl Franz!\n\nThey improved a lot as far as cavalry is concerned, too. It used to always be a little disappointing to me in previous games when a cavalry charge would just fail because the enemy turned his units just on time. Now Cav has weight, and units WILL go flying even when prepared. Also no more of that "if one unit is engaged the whole cavalry stops and turns back" BS.\n\nSpells are fun to use as well. Seriously powerful, but not completely OP.\n\nThe campaign is actually really intelligently done, too. When I first heard that say the Empire could only take occupy other human settlements and Vampire Count settlements, I was a little concerned. But it turns out it is really a smart move because now every campaign will automatically feel different, since you will be settling in different regions completely-ish.\n\nI had stopped enjoying Total War games since Shogun 2. However, I can now finally say that this is no longer the case. Bottom line, this game is great, and I highly recommend it! Oh and you don't need to be a big Warhammer fan to enjoy the game. I barely know anything about it, yet I am having a blast! I am sure it helps, but I don't think you will miss serious story-altering facts (yes, I realize Warhammer fans now think I'm a giant ♥♥♥♥♥...

Excitement about Warhammer finally coming to life in a game system worthy of this fantastic IP, and fear that it wouldn't be done right.\n\nCreative Assembly did it right! -The graphics are beautiful, and the art style captures Warhammer exactly.\n-Map size is more intimate than previous Total Wars but almost every province has some unique trade resource or something that gives a buff to recruited troops or something to make it interesting, more than just bland territory.\n-They weren't able to include EVERY unit I wanted to see from the Warhammer, but there are a lot and they are awesome.\n-Awesome randomised loot.\n-The Tech-trees and building trees are the simplified style of Attila/Rome\n-The character customisation and variety interrelates with the tech trees and buildings to actually make a complex tech/economy/character item system.\n-You can make buff heroes, assassins, security specialists, economy buffers, combat tanks, combat buffers, spellcasters.You can also stack multiple heroes in a lords army, each with their own character and spec. related buffs, abilities and items, making even more combos.\n-REPLAYABILITY, You literally get 5 Total War games in 1!\n-Each Campaign is totally different (there are 5). Totally different as in "They share nothing in common."\n-Strong sense of story and important/ominous events, even though the game is still a sandbox.\n\nSummary:"it's fun as hell, a game you can lose yourself in." If you aren't already a long-time fan but you like dark fantasy worlds, strategy and grand battles as well as RPG-style Wizards, Warriors and powerful artifacts, then I'd highly recommend this game, it's fun as hell, a game you can lose yourself in.\n\nIf, like me, you have been waiting to see if Creative Assembly was going to make a sham of our beloved Warhammer franchise like so many have done before, then you can put those fears to rest. Game 1 is a success.\n\nNot everything is it in yet, but there is enough, more than enough, and what's there is GREAT.\n\nCA have 100% proven themselves capable of making a great Warhammer game. It's a fantastic experience and well worth paying full price for, even just on the merits of this first game by itself.\n\nAs CA release DLC and freeLC over the  remainder of Game 1's cycle and in time add to the campaign with Warhammer Games 2 and 3, I fully expect the combined final game to be an absolute masterpiece.\n\n10/10 - I bought it twice, that's how F**king good it is","May 28","true","185.2"," 36 of 55 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","36","55","2","1"

Picking a fantasy world was a good idea because their other games were just loosely historic. It is fun for awhile.\n\nMany, many, many issues from the old Total War titles still remain. Diplomacy has not changed, at all, every other turn goes like this - Allies ask for help, I declare war, next turn enemy asked for peace (offers ~1500), I make peace(make free money), next turn allies ask for help again, repeat (repeat every 5 turns or so, I decided not to make peace just to speed up my turns). Enemy generals charge straight into battle, except in this Total War generals are more powerful, so it is less of an instant win. Enemies still (STILL!!!!!!! Come on) make armies that are stacks of mostly catapults !!!! It is bad enough fighting stacks of Orcs made up of 50% archers. What is the fun in that? This Total war must use the same method for determining army composition, they didnt even try.\n\nOn the battle map, the enemy AI only has two modes - 1. Advance toward player, hope archer units can ♥♥♥♥ off player and draw forces away. 2. Flank at any cost. Thats it. That is how every battle is played. If you guard your flanks well the AI will stop moving and think, it is the same as other total war games.\n\nFound what I think might be a bug. If you select a hero ("agent") (Thane for example as Dwarves) then hit the arrow at the top of the screen to cycle through all of your characters, it jumps to the lords (generals) and never goes back to the heros ("agents"). It will just cycle between your generals. *Edit: I think when cycling through characters it only skips the ones that are in an army. Still kinda buggy though.\n\nUnits are not balanced well. I will have to mod them. Chariots have tons of hit points, and just sit there as multiple units attack. Orc cheap'o archers have the missile damage as Dwarves, who are masters of technology (crossbows, rifles, cannons).\n\nHere are a couple of pros. Dwarf and goblin underground movement is just plain awesome. It is an improvement that is just perfect. It makes sense, it plays well, adds a whole new dimension. I also like being able to collect items for generals and heros. Works well, almost RPG-like.","May 24","false","52.7"," 245 of 436 people (56%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","56","245","436","11","6"

Battles are fun, maps feel varied for field battles and the game overall runs great. Overall I love this game.\nSadly though it does have a couple glaring drawbacks.\nCampaign map is severely limiting. Tons of attrition zones all over the map.\nEconomy is super simple.\nDiplomacy can be a real pain in the rear. Don't bother confederating. You end up with huge diplomatic and public order issues.\nSieges are extremely stripped down from Rome 2. Not a bad thing in theory. I always felt like the battles were far too spread out in the huge city sieges. Pathing needs work though. Siege towers tend to derp out at the last few feet from the walls.\nMy largest complaint though is the Multiplayer campaign.

Most people in Western countries are well aware of what Games Workshop is, they're the gaming store that you thought was a video game store but have beautiful and expensive tabletop miniatures. I have delved into tabletop games like Dungeons and Dragons, but I never had the funds or time to collect the Warhammer miniatures, although I have always been curious about playing them.  Total War: Warhammer is a match made in heaven for strategy/war games.\n\nFun Fact: World of Warcraft swiped most of their character designs from it's predecessor Warhammer. Warcraft is an individual character driven franchise while Warhammer is based around massive armies and factions.\n\nGraphics 9/10 - Textures are great character models sometimes feel a very little bit stiff with their animation/movement but is only noticeable when you zoom in all the way.\nMusic 8/10 - It's fitting for the game and I didn't have to turn it down or off like I do for most games that have annoying music.\nGameplay 10/10 - This game is a blast, some of the most fun I've had in years, It really makes you feel like you're part of your army waging war.

You will be commanding entire armies into battle with artillery, cavalry, infantry, monsters even tanks for the imperium (steam!). Don't expect to join the troops in combat during the battle (how cool of an option would that be though?) it's strictly armchair quarterbacking.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=693099821  Screenshots are low settings on Gfx, my rig is 4 years old.\n\nCampaign(single) play you can pause the action, give orders and unpause but in general it plays like an RTS without resource gathering. Once you become good at this, try MP without the ability to pause, co-op is a good place to start. Lots of fun to be had with you and others defending a city from hordes of greenskins or undead or chaos! Yes, there is multiplayer campaign modes that can go into hundreds of turns.\n\nIf you like anything to do with either Warhammer Fantasy or Total War this is a must own just to see the armies of your imagination in full combat. It is amazing, especially through a stereo system. With full workshop and modding support I expect a 40k mod to be one of the first.  The animations are incredible, from the Chaos Giant vomiting poison on his enemies to the Dwarf Iron Drake's deadly streams of fire it does not dissapoint. Here is imperium artillery:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=697566955\n\nThe greenskins use goblins as ammunition for their catapults. It's a sight to behold! The different factions are well balanced, from Humans to Vampire/Undead to Greenskins to Dwarfs to Chaos they all have their strengths and weaknesses and victory just takes a good general.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=695480008\n\nThere have been a few issues with an occasional game exception but for my rig, one of the least buggy Total War releases ever and all my gear is 4 years old.\n\nIf you don't know Total War, I suggest waiting for Total War: Arena (f2p) to come back out in a few months. You can whet your whistle and see if the TW franchise is for you. By then TW:Warhammer will be on sale.\n\nRight now, even at full price there is little wait time to get a MP match, even Co-Op or 4 vs 4 siege or land battles so if you're a fan join us in TOTAL WAR!","June 4","true","68.5"," 24 of 36 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","24","36","3","7"

And it was enjoyable all the way, still is, even so there's no challenge left, unless i declare war on dwarfs for some stupid reason.\n\nTeh launchOh god, CA have done it again, or did they?\nSo, what was all that fuss about just when the game was launched? Servers. It is true that alot(including me) couldnt start the game. But its all because of insane load that was put on the servers, game was completely playable with steam in offline mode, obviously you couldnt play mp in this case, but for singleplayer there was no issue. Purely because of that this awesome game got alot of negative reviews, if you can call "it doesnt work" a reveiw... All i did is 1 minute search to figure out where is the problem and how to fix it. Still i've waited, coz i was a bit affraid of not getting achievements in offline mode, but all i had to wait is like 10 more hours, which is my sleep-time anyway, thanks to the timezone.\nSo do understand that this game optimized perfectly and works without any issue, one minor thing at the start, that wasnt connected to the game itself isnt something to be affraid of, since its all fixed and i've no issue since.\n\nIs game that demanding?For people that complaining about how demamding this game is for your hardware. It is NOT. I've radion hd 6950 and low end i7. For the current time it is literally a toster comparing to the good gaming PC. And i've no lags or fps drops at all. Granted i'm playing on medium with only couple setting on high(and some on low) and only unit size is on ultra, but it is still loooking pretty good and i cant complain that ultra wouldnt work for me, game isnt the one to blame if i dont have a hardware to run it in all its beauty.\nSo if you have good gaming PC - dont worry it will work all fine on high\ultra. If you've a toster like mine, then still you can play without any issue with good enough visuals. It even works better than rome2 for me.\n\nGameplayGoing to the gameplay, it is very interesting. I've to note that i might be bored of it in future and its all good now just because its new, but for now i've no big complaints. AI is pretty good in battle, constantly trying to pick a good fight for itself and outflank you, still kinda predictable, but challenging enough if it have the numbers. Its not that easy to win with Heroic Victory as often as in Rome2 for example.\n\nFor the settlements capture thingy - you have enough to capture, honestly. And since there's a mod since day1 that even CA help to develop i dont see any issue with such gameplay decision in vanilla version. Moving on.\n\nI absulutely love heroes, lords and magic. Its not overpowered. Well, it is, if used correctly. But same as unit of pikemen in rome\rome2 for example, if you will only attack it from the front - tough guys to beat. But with a little thought it is an easy target. So yes, someone like Grimgor or Kholek CAN wipe entire unit(s) of low\med tier troops by themselves. But there's alot of counters to that. As an example, for Emplire one of the things is ability of Witch Hunter, that this hero can unlock on just 3rd level, with insane damage on single target.\nPoint is, that as long as you playing it smart - everything can be beaten and there's nothing really OP. Heroes are fine and personally i love playing with them, legendary lords especialy.\n\nFor the strategy part, there's some feeling of "oh well, that was easy" if you'd play as Empire(and, i think, Dwarfs), because when Chaos start its advance, all human\dwarfs factions pretty much unite. Also got other empire faction to join confederation is way too easy, especially when Chaos starts to bring it. I'm not saying that it is a flaw of the game, since it does feel pretty natural, but if you want a real challenge, you might think of playing not as dwarfs or empire. Overall its is still fun to see all these unique buildings tied to the Lore, planning where you need to build what to get most of these uniques and so on, i do enjoi it. Maybe it isnt challenging as Empire or Dwarfs if you're not a new player to total war series. But then again, I might just got lucky that all northern factions could hold chaos\norska long enough for me to build all my defences and armies. I might be lucky that Dwarfs completely pwned the Greenskins, that Vampires dont even try to go out of Sylvania, that southerners didnt try to attack me before chaos invaded and so on and on and on. So dont take my experience from one single campaign as empire for the whole story, just my perspective from one side. But i do feel that it was too easy for a hard difficulty, maybe i'm to experienced, maybe luck, cant know for sure... yet.\n\nLordsI do want to point out that skill-tree of lords, at least Empire ones need some rework. Blue line mostly uselsess. You might go for 1st skill of +10% campaign movement and thats pretty much it. Other things are way too minor, some have a bit of sence, like a reduction of chaos\vampire corruption and more exp to new recruits, but then again, AI not aggressive enough to spreading said corrution and more exp to recruits ability is really needed for 1-2 generals to made them governors that sit in your main training provinces all the time. So yeah, need some rework, i guess. Even for heroes, they're way more effective in battle, so blue line of skills for them mostly useless as well, not as much as for lords, but still.\n\n2nd thing i didnt really like - some things you need to do for unique quests that grants your legendary lords their unique items. For example Karl Franz need to beat 5 armies for one of his quests, easy enough you'd think? Well, it have to be greenskins armies, that almost wiped out by the dwarfs at the point i got this quest. So it is annoying, but then again, this stage might me auto-completed\skipped or replaced if there's no greenskins to kill, who knows, i didnt got to test that yet. So this might not be an issue at all.\n\n\nRuinsThis thing i really dont like, or more AI behavior about it. It have to be limited to greenskins and chaos to be honest. Other factions should be able to raze only the Norsca settlemens. Or AI have to be reworked how it treats such ability. Because for now its stupid. I've whole northern dwarf settlemens in ruins and dwarfs completely ignore to get them. And if there's maybe some reason for it(finishing off greenskins), why the hell Kislev and northern empire factions do not care for ruins that chaos\norsca maid of their settlements at all i've no idea, they have an armies and money to restore them but nope, literally ignored the whole time. AI fond of making ruins, but they never going to settle them. Quite annoying to watch.\nBut this already being modded, and maybe even CA change this thing in the future, so yet again, not really an issue if you consider the mods.\n\n\nConclusionVery fun to play, i've enjoyed every minute of this game and love that total war exploring fantasy now. And i've never been so hyped for dlc's, since they're aiming to add many more factions to this game, as it has beed confirmed in this tweet: https://twitter.com/totalwar/status/736271407345225728\n\nCant wait for lizardmen or skaven. And even elfs. This game overachieved in every thing i've expecting from it and optimized so well i honestly cant believe, that i'm able to play it without getting a new pc.\n\nCertainly i DO recommend this game, no matter if you're experienced total war player or a newbie. And since it is demands so little from your hardware, while looking so great - i've to say its THE best game CA made so far and shame on ppl that hating on it just because of one minor thing that wasnt real issue at the launch of the game.\n\nPeace, i'm out to play more of it and try every legendary lord and magic in campaigns.","May 30","true","155.1"," 26 of 40 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","26","40","0","0"

The game, while being very good - both in performance (no crashes, no bugs - thus far) and game play - is extremely shallow. More so than any other big title game I've ever owned. The playable races are few, and we are unable to play as the minor factions - which means that after a handful of campaigns there's nothing left, at all, in single player value.\n\nI don't wanna write another of those "The evil corporations are charging us for an unfinished game, then selling us the rest at extortion rates."-reviews, we have enough of those, and there's plenty of reason for it. However I will say this: At the current pricing you're not getting proper value, even if you would still be able to get Chaos for free.\n\nThe game, as it stands, delivers about 20-30 EUR worth of playabilty, so don't pay more than that.\n\nAnd I urge you to be cautious when the obvious DLC's for the left out factions start hitting the markets - they will most likely be overpriced and underwhelming as well.\n\nPick this game up at a sale, or not at all.\n\nIt's a pretty hilarious and well built game, but very half-completed and EXTREMELY overpriced.\n\nAs such I must recommend you to NOT buy it for more than 30 EUR, Chaos DLC included.","June 3","false","31.7"," 30 of 48 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","30","48","0","0"

This is also my first review. Ever.\n\nWhen I heard they were combining the two I thought it sounded like a perfect match. I am going to love this game. Yet when I started playing I could just make an hour before exiting in disappointment.\n\nWhy did they simplify/remove all the unit abilities? No shield walls, various forms of arrows are gone, formation charges in cavalry is missing. It feels like so much of the previous tactical elements have been removed. You either attack with units that counter the enemy, or out flank them. I’m disappointed in the lack of depth; it could have been so much more. I like that my artillery guys are badass though, but why don’t they ever miss. Aim of the gods! The unit roster seems bare to the bone and I’m feeling a little cheated in buying this game. Maybe I should’ve done some more research. This I really was not expecting.\n\nThey took away so much and gave me magic instead. Thanks, would’ve been cool if I could use it in combination with all the other abilities you used to have. Each time a new total war comes out I get excited, yet it seems I am just setting myself up for disappointment.\n\nIf you’re telling me that some of these elements are missing because it is dictated by lore in Warhammer, I will say that is complete nonsense. This is Warhammer combined with total war. It should provide me with the best elements of both. If I wanted to stay completely true to Warhammer lore I would go down to my local Warhammer shop and battle people on table to with good old fashioned dice (which seems way more preferable right now). I really hope that at least one dev reads this and understands. “Guys, we messed up and need to fix this.” I hope would be his reaction. I am not holding my breath however, because after all the good reviews critics gave they are probably giving themselves a pat on the back.\n\nHere is to the new era of fast and dumb gaming.\n\nARMY CUSTOMIZATION. It is one of the main attractions of warhammer and 40k. Seems to be almost non-existent in this.\n\nI will crack on for a little and see if things get better. Not getting my hopes up however. Now I will probably have to rely on Radious or someone like that in fixing the game for me. It seems like I have to rely on community mods way too much for games these days.\n\nI wanted to write a short review, but at the same time I just had to voice my disappointment.\n\nAlthough not the same team, I really really hope they do the next Dawn of War better. I heard they are already removing the cover system similar to company of heroes, opting for the old simplified version of just standing in a crater for cover bonus. You will know what I’m talking about if you played the first Dawn of Wars.\n\nI’m still loyal, but a severely disappointed customer. Please guys…Get you things in order. You might cater for the masses who play the campaign once and leaves, but think about your long time fans as well.","May 29","false","1.8"," 172 of 314 people (55%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","55","172","314","9","8"

After those, the series began building up. Building up in complexity, in graphical fidelity, in AI capability, and in campaign replayability.\nWhile Empire and Rome 2 had particularly AWFUL launches, and Rome 2's lack of a solid family tree system was unexpected, none of the games have been an overall step back. Each one has increased the offering that Total War provides. More interesting maps, more dynamic gameplay mechanics, more complex management. It's great. Total War has consistently grown and as a Total War fanboy that's excited me, because despite buggy launches I've been able to watch my favorite gaming franchise GROW over the years I've been gaming.\n\nWarhammer. Warhammer is an awesome franchise with serious Total War potential. While the game is visually stunning and INCREDIBLE from an audio standpoint (it's Richard Beddow's first legitimately good score imo), the mechanics are a gigantic step back.\n\nWhere is the complexity?\n\nWarhammer is an enormous dumbing down of franchise mechanics. It feels like it was made to give a bunch of first-time-RTS players a jaw-dropping hour or two of gameplay.\nSure, engaging newer/more casual markets is good, but there is nothing here for you strategy game fans. There is no genuine challenge or complexity, no balancing act of mechanics. The simplicity of the game is not really made up for in its presentation value. The shock dies off very quickly, considering games like Stellaris came out around the same time.\n\nDon't buy Warhammer if you're a Total War fan or a fan of strategy games. Wait for a super sale.\nIf you're just wanting to send legions of skeletons to bash into humans in shining armor or orks in spiked platemail for a couple hours then maybe it's worth it. But please don't judge the Total War franchise based on this game. Total War is a series of incredible strategy games that consistently set the bar in the genre alongside the big Paradox titles. Warhammer is a terrible example, and it's the first in the series to seriously disappoint this avid strategy gamer.","June 3","false","38.5"," 76 of 136 people (56%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","56","76","136","4","4"

Don't normally bother, but this game is getting some hate for some dubious reasons.\nPlayed for 6 hour so far and had a bug free experience. Had to update my drivers and verify my game cache to get it started however.\n\nThis game plays much as I thought it would, a total war game set in the WHFB universe (apparently this was a surprise for some people?!). Looks great overall, units and animations are superb. Some of castle sieges could be in more open environments like in ME2TW,  instead of been blocked off. The AI is better then expected, but I did have low expectations in this regard.\n\nThis game is fun, challanging and seems like it will be repayable. I think has lots of potential for future updates both free and paid for DLC.\n","May 24","true","27.9"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","14","20","0","0"

I'm still recommending the game (barely), however I am changing it from 4 stars to 3 stars:\n\nThis is a good total war game, but not the best.  CA definitley didn't put a lot of effort into the depth of the game.  On a star rating, I would give it 3 out of 5 because it is not perfect and has some pretty serious gameplay issues and definitely lacks in some depth compared to other Total War titles.  As usual, it is graphically amazing.  The battles are fun (except the seige battles), and the game will suck up a lot of your time especially if you play almost every battle like I do.  I've never played "Warhammer" so I was not familiar with the various cultures of the game, however despite my misgivings about this latest installment of the Total War franchise not being based history, I did find it somewhat refreshing to take a break from "Rome 3 Total War", or it most likely would have been "Empire II".  So far I have tried out Choas, Empire, and Vampires and found each one uniquely different, and not just in the units they can recruit.  Their Tech Tree's are completely different, as are the diplomatic options and the way they go about unlocking units and/or technology, forcing a different play style depending on the culture you select.  The game is also extremely stable, I have over 90 hours and it has not crashed once... Kudo's on that.  So Graphically great, fun, and engaging... what is there to complain about?\n\nThe drawbacks of the game are things that most likely will get fixed with patches or in the Workshop or with content purchases.\n\n1) There are limited factions to start.. I would really like to play Bretonia, however it isn't an option.  Also, the map doesn't seem as expansive as titles like Rome or Atilla offered, although the battle maps (except the seige maps) offer a wide variety of terrain..\n\n2) The AI seems to be dead set on Razing every settlement, and to recolonize a settlement, no matter if you have 2 units or 20 in your army, will cost almost half of the army.  Part of the problem with razing is because for some reason, orcs and dwarves can only colonize their own kind or each others regions, Vampires and Humans are likewise, and Chaos cannot colonize any regions. Because of that, they just raze any settlement they can't colonize.\n\n3) Another AI problem is the the AI has no strategy.  It just rushes you with everything it has, and recruits like 10 archer units (for factions that have them) and pelts your soldiers with missles as they are engaged with the other 10 cavalry and infantry units.  Think you can just use your own cavalry to rush them off? Think again, because half of the missle units are light cavalry that can outrun and pelt your cavalry.\n\n4) Confederations happen way to fast, within 30 turns, the Dwarves had all become one confederation, the empire and become one confederation, and Bretonia had most of their regions in one confederation, which meant here were only like 5 factions left taking a bit of fun out of the game.\n\n5) Also, thankfully Chaos Warriors came free with my pre-order because they are by far the least fun faction to play, they have very limited diplomacy and outside of the norselands are just attack and raze, attack and sack, and repeat and so forth.\n\n6) (Added) The seige battles suck. You no longer get a town view in a minor settlement, it's all done open terrain. In major settlements, you get half of a city, one segment of wall, and the archers (even after attrition from starvation) and towers will pick off most of your army by the time your seige equipment gets to the walls... no matter how far back you put them.  You will also need at least 4 seige towers(8 total) and two battering rams for each seige battle because the archers will destroy at least 6 seige towers plus  any catapults you have.\n\n7) (Edit) I initially said there was no group formation, there is one, but it's a little button on the group tab that you have to click and it can be a pain in the ♥♥♥ when you're in the midst of a battle to select and de-select.\n\nFinale note, It would also be nice to see some kind of a missle and/or artillery unit for the Vampire Counts.","May 29","true","177.9"," 26 of 43 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","26","43","2","0"

Big step back. There is little to do on a campaign map, and even less to do that is interesting. diplomacy has declined even further, and now does not work at all. Playing on any high difficulty will see humans and chaos band against you alongside orcs, humans refuse any and all diplomacy (this is as empire) and an AI that likes to starve you out of cities instead of fighting you.\n\nThere are no villages, and there is some sort of opaque weight of numbers stuff in the coding that prevents a smaller force from winning, ever. period. A smaller army incurs debuffs that stack in accordance to the size difference, preventing you from winning any battles that involve you having more than a couple units less than the enemy. High difficulty Ai gets a campaign movement bonus that prevents you from catching their armies, and they refuse to fight battles where they don't have a numerical disadvantage.\n\nIt is without a doubt the least fun I have had playing a single player total war game, and I already want to go back to Attila and Shogun.\n\nMultiplayer is okay, but there are obvious, basic balance issues and yet again no Avatar Conquest, meaning there is no reason to play multiplayer at all. Shogun had the greatest online rts-rpg of all time, and they just dropped it? Why? Warhammer would be PERFECT for avatar conquest, but nope.\n\nThey put SO much more effort into marketing this game and creating promotional materials for it than they did ensuring it was a fun, lasting and replayable experience like many total wars have been. They have failed badly.\n\nBut sales are up! WOO! So they will keep doing and doing and doing this ♥♥♥♥. Despite the unfinished animations, cartoony, low-res, horribly-aliased graphical step backwards from Attila and Rome, and in my own opinion even shogun.\n\nOh well. Better luck next time. Don't hold your breath though, because when a company makes this much more money while spending less and less on good game design, testing, and graphical art, the lessons they learn will undoubtedly send them down a patch that leads to more marketing and sharkish IP hunting and exploitation.\nBe honest with yourself. They did not do total warhammer (the real name to me) because of their passion for Warhammer - as the unfinished mess of a game shows. They did it because they knew it would be a massive cash cow.\n\nAvoid this game, and perhaps they will do something better next time that will be worth your money. It is probably too late to fix this game, as there is jsut too much wrong with it.","May 25","false","91.0"," 205 of 381 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","205","381","2","20"

Its not so much about rebuilding an ancient empire, but about building armies, and destroying other factions. It feels more like a RTS game which is a nice and interesting chance of pace. Thanks to the fantasy world, many of the historical descrepensies in previous games are avoided and you can simply focus on playing an awsome game. CA seems to have stripped out all of the clutter type features that have been tried in previous games, and left only the solid and useable ones in tact. Not to mention some new features have been added which I thought I was not going to like, but as long as you keep the theme of RTS in your mind, it makes sense. (Ill let you guys figure the new features out) This game plays similar to Shogun 2; it feels like CA went back to basics to give a game that is packed with immersive gameplay. There seems to be far fewer bugs on this release which is a plus.  Also, while the diplomacy at times can feel like everyone wants to be your friend (something that can easily be fixed) I have found that as soon as I get complacent I will be attacked by a faction that has hordes of armies, and it is definately a challenege, and the AI seems to be more coherent using all means at their disposal.  The game is not perfect, but its definately a vast improvement over older titles.","May 24","true","53.3"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","12","17","2","0"

No crashes, but I'm getting the flickering screen bug.\n\n\nThe game feels so much simpler than the previous ones. Perhaps because CA was always implementing new mechanics in order to make things more complicated. Now it's so simple that you almost misses some of the old features.\n\nThe battles are amazing, and the AI seems better than before except when they are defending a siege, in these cases the AI sucks 100% and I can demolish them with just ranged weapons and don't lose a single unit in the process.\n\nDiplomacy needs attention. It improved in the sense that I don't get allies that recently signed a non-agression pact with me attacking me for no reason. But at the same time, it's stupidly easy to extort your allies for money, they also just beg to become your allie when chaos invades, so you become ultra rich by turn 150.\n\nSo far, what I like the most are the battles. It feels really nice and exciting because the units are so different from each other. The magics and heros also play a big part. Quite different from historical battles. It's important to notice that the battles were also dumbed down, I really miss some features present in Attila and Rome 2 that gave me more control of my units. This game is way more limited to macro. Microing here is just rear charge, repositioning and spam hero spells.\n\nSince you can't conquer the whole map, the campaign feels short. I'm 150 turns in my first campagin, and I'll finish it in 40 more or so. In contrast to Rome 2, where I would frequently play for 400+ turns, that's quite a lot less.\n\n\nAs far as performance goes, I'm running everything on ULTRA, 1080p, with all the effects turned on and MLAA, and I'm getting 60 FPS most of the time, even on battles. Some battles I noticed my FPS went down to 48 for a short time, but it's important to notice that NVIDIA still doesn't have drivers for this game. My 970 is heavily OCed aswell. I also noticed a glitch, where sometimes for short amount of periods, while on the campaign map my GPU would drop usage down to 20% and my FPS would tank.\n\nBut as far as glitches go, no game breaking ones besides the siege AI.\n\n20 hours in, the excitment of the release worning off, and the impression that really sticks for me is that the game is too dumbed down. It doesn't need to be as complex as Atilla, but when the mechanics are way too simple, the game tends to lose replayability and become boring.\n\n8/10 so far.","May 24","true","59.8"," 21 of 34 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","21","34","0","0"

It was also caused by the unhappiness that Ca decided to create warhammer series for total war. I had really big prejudice against it, but the i decide to buy it and give it a try. I went a bit deeper into the game and now i changed my view on it.\n\nPros\n-So Warhammer is the newest total war fantasy game. It adds to game several new features, like magic, 1 unit generals called heroes and lords each with specific abilities, regional occupation, etc. So it is not the same as it was in the older titles, its something new :D\n-The thing which must be said is that it is the most polished tw game on release, only few people had problems running it on the release day, but now it is fixed i believe^^\n-game has great potential\n-In terms of grapfics, game looks good, even on lower settings\n-sound: not bad, music in the game makes good atmosphere\n-optimalization: i think it runs nearly the same as attila for me( i have a bit potato comp^^), so i guess it was a bit optimized, but not than much weaker pcs. Dont worry, if u can run attila, u can surely run this game as well\n- Campaign AI got improved, it provides now bigger challange on highest difficulties, so it take a bit more of strategic thinking to achieve victory\n-ingame speeches for units have more variety for each faction\n-it has mod support\n\nCons\n-engine: the same as in attila/rome2\n-i dont like the look of the campaign map (but this is just my personal opinion)\n-battle animations: not the most proper ones, could have been much better\n-balance:units and their stats(price, melee attack, damage)seems to be seriously unbalanced, which i see as the most serious problem.\n-multiplayer: nothing new, revolutionary, its still the same as it was in attula and rome 2. I think that something similar to avatar conquest like it was in shogun 2 would be great in this game.\n-rare crashes\n-some performance issues\n\nSo overhaully, the game is not actually bad and most of my listed cons are not than serious. If u are  huge total war series fan or fanatsy fan, then i recommend it and get it soon to enjoy it. If u are historical total war fan, then wait rather for the next historical tw game. As i said before, the game has great potential, so im really looking forward to see how the game will be improving and hopefully, in the end it will be good.\n\nAs im big historical total war titles fan and im not even interested in fantasy, i must definitely say that you people should give this game a try","May 29","true","9.7"," 31 of 53 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","31","53","0","8"

I just don't, because it's never been a thing for me. So feel free to judge, critique, or whatever you fancy.\n\nI have played other Total war titles, and most of these induced some form of hype prior to release. Some lived up to it, but more did not. Total War's most recent addition, TW: Warhammer is a new and welcome addition to the former. There may only be five playable factions (for now), but the amount of content for each one; be it quest lines, events, missions, or simply lore for the most die-hard of Warhammer fans; you will most likely be satisfied until new content becomes available in the coming weeks and months. I will admit that most of my experience so far comes from the Dwarves and the Empire, but I have dabbled in the three remaining factions (for the uninformed, they are the Vampire Counts, the Greenskins, and the Warriors of Chaos), and from simply scratching the surface, I found them appealing enough to dig deeper (I simply haven't gotten around to it yet, preferring to finish what I already have started).\n\nTW: Warhammer is one of the games where you will lose (badly oftentimes, especially if you underestimate your opponent for whatever reason) but the thrill of facing a superior enemy means that when you DO manage to send them reeling backwards in retreat, it is that much more satisfying. More than that, each faction has their own unique way of doing so. The Dwarves have the (arguably) most basic approach of any faction, and one that is best summed up in one word; wall. The Dwarf units, even the ones they start out with, are quite tough un-aided, and when provided with buffs from their Lords and tech tree, can prove quite formidable foes. The Dwarves, as a general rule of thumb, are unyielding. They do not give ground easily, they do not move around easily, they do not DIE easily. The three things you can expect them to do easily is grumble (and they will do so if you cannot rid the Dammaz Kron of Grudges), make money (and you WILL be making tons later on) and drink copious amounts of ale (the Dwarven kind, not the disgustingly watered down pigswill that the manlings of the Empire have taken to). The Dwarves also have (again, arguably) the best artillery in the game. This, combined with their ability to seize a patch of ground, then hold it against daunting odds is what makes them a foe (or ally) to be feared and respected in equal measure.\n\nThe Empire is the most flexible of the Old World factions, and it has to be. As the leader of a divided and bereft bunch of bickering nation-states, you will be facing (and probably bearing the brunt of) an impending invasion of the Norsican tribes, and their dark masters; Chaos. While Chaos hates everyone more or less equally, you are a partial exception. In other words, they are out for blood; more specifically, your blood. Thus, given the target on your back, it behooves you to move with purpose. What is that purpose? Why, welding the disparate nations of the Empire into a unified whole, of course! This can be accomplished through the tried-and-true Napoleonic method, the less murderous Confederation option, or through recolonizing the burnt out sections as they fight each other. To your West, lies the lands of Bretonnia and the other pseudo-french states (and a single tribe of Orks, more on that later). If you feel the uncontrollable urge to conquer, pillage, and murder them, do so with care because they can be quite formidable in battle. If you are not properly prepared to swiftly conquer them, especially if you have not united the Empire prior, you are doomed to a long, hard slog that will only weaken you both before Chaos arrives in force. To your North, the Noriscan tribes will descend southwards to pillage your territories, and those of your allies. In fact, they will even attack the Orks and the Dwarves, given the chance. Counter-attacking into their lands is difficult but not impossible and for the more belligerently-inclined, can prove quite lucrative. To your direct East lies other Imperial states (and Russi-I mean Kislev) and eventually the Vampire Counts. Conquering other human factions, or waiting for the Vampires to come to your door, it matters not. You will end up facing them one way or another, and better it be on your terms, than theirs. Short of Chaos, they will likely be your most bitter opponent. Why? Because your dead will not necessarily stay dead. In fact, the Vampires will raise the dead (theirs and yours) at every opportunity, and this is their potentially most dangerous quality; quantity. They will drown you in bodies if you let them. Of course, they also have monsters and unspeakable horrors. Of the factions, Vampires have some of the most potent magic and can raise the dead on the battlefield. Their array of monsters is also some of the most extensive of any faction, and they can prove deadly. Any campaign against the Vampires will most likely take some time, because they live for a war of attrition.\n\nThe Dwarves will not usually trouble the Empire much, because Dawi and Umgi (Dwarf and Human, respectively) have little to bicker about; neither can conquer the others' lands, and both make equitable (if not amenable) trading partners. But as the Empire (did I forget to mention you have two between you and the pseudo-French?), it is in your best interest to treat them with respect, because they are useful allies to have; no matter how small (never say this to a Dwarf, because an axe to your face is the most likely and subsequently LEAST painful method of recompense). Orks are not worth mentioning, because they are more the Dwarves' problem than yours, though you will have to face one tribe to the Northwest.\n\nChaos, to your far Northeast, is the ultimate foe. They will murder everything and leave the world bereft of even the most minute single-celled bacteria that isn't infected by their corruptive influence. No approach is fool-proof, so all I can say is this; aid your allies when they need it, call upon your allies when YOU need it, and don't be afraid to retreat when necessary. You will have allies in the fight against Chaos, and you are the shield behind which they will strike out from. Collaboration is your best survival technique.\n\nI apologize for not being able to offer anymore on the remaining three factions campaigns but, as I noted above, I have yet to play them myself, and can only offer what I know from facing them. I hope to play their campaigns soon, and will (hopefully) enjoy them as thoroughly as I have the previous ones. To those looking to buy or contemplating saving your money, I enjoy the game, but it is not without its' shortcomings. Agents, for the moment, seem to favor the AI's chance of success more than yours; it can be irritating but is by no means game-breaking. The game will punish you for mistakes made; if your army is a hapless mosh-posh of mixed units, with no thought given to what they might face, odds are that army will perish. There are no naval battles (and I myself am a BIG naval enthusiast) which is a bit disappointing. To me, the set-piece naval battles of Napoleon and Empire were some of the best( and still are); as opposed to the mess that is Rome 2 and Attila naval battles. Hopefully, there will be room to add them (in a playable, fun, and meaningful way) into the game in future. And battles can be messy, and fast-paced. The things that detract from the game, however, are suprisingly minor when taken in scope with the whole.\n\nI myself would rate TW: Warhammer at about 4.1-4.2 stars out of five. Nothing is perfect, and games are no exception. There are almost certainly problems I have missed, and parts of the game I have undoubtedly glossed over; but in my humble opinion Total War: Warhammer is a significant achievement for Creative Assembly.

People who love total war and people who love Warhammer will enjoy it.  There will be some people from both groups who hate the game and there reasons are sound but there on the extreme end of the player base.\n\nThe games fun, changes everytime you start a new campaign. No two campaigns are going to play exactly the same which i like.\n\nIts everything you have come to expect from a total war game.... but is that enough??  For me the answers yes but only just.  Let me explain i do enjoy the game last nights first play through on the Vampire count campaign had me coming up for air at 3am.  But some things i would have expected arent there, now this wont take away from the game.... there just things i expected from both a total war and Warhammer title.   Let me explain.\n\nLets start with the Total war part of me...  The dev\'s made a choice it seems to make the siege system simple so as not to bore the younger Warhammer players who might not enjoy it so much... which i understand.  But I expected more.  I expected to be assaulting a city or walled town, not a corner of it or an empty field.  It seems in this you have taken to far a step back.  Another miss was giving me cannons and volley guns and catapults then forgetting to add mounting points to my walls, try as i might i dont see how that one was missed.\n\nThen from the Warhammer side of me.... Im gonna use the Empire as a reference for this cause its the easiest but it does apply to all current factions.  You have your basic army list in there nicely structure well thought out, but you missed all the depth that makes its warhammer.   An empire army just isnt that generic....  Wheres the depth??  Yes i want to see my swordsmen and halberdiers all lined up in formation but where are the units that make the empire armies what they are....  My Knight or the Blazing Sun or my Nuln Halberdiers that were always considered Better than normal, The Knights panther or Knights of the white wolf.    You added the lore in part to your building tree but then missed the units out completely.\n\nIts little things like that take away from the game for me.\n\nOverall a good game, shame its just drops the ball alittle on the Great game i was looking forward to.","June 1","true","103.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KristijanZuzija/recommended/364360/","KristijanZuzija","Ƹ̵̡DRCLƷ Whitest Wolf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KristijanZuzija/","460 products in account","I've finished a campaign and played every multiplayer mode before writing this review.\n\nPros:\n\n- Optimization. I know some Nvidia users have reported problems but I am using AMD and for me it runs flawlessly while I could barely navigate Atilla's menu because of the low fps I was getting.\n\n- Variety. Factions in other Total War titles didn't have too much variety to them. Each faction had a set of infantry, cavalry, archers, etc. and they mostly felt like reskins of each other, but with slight bonuses in certain aspects. This is not the case in this game where each faction truly feels unique and completely different. Ranging from giants to flying contraptions and magic casters, there is a huge amount of variety in this game and it will only increase with further expansions and dlcs.\n\n- Replayability. Because of how each faction is so different from one another, playing as a different faction feels almost like playing a whole different game. You assume a wholly different playstyle and it feels great. Also, built-in mod support from day one really adds to the variety in the long run.\n\n- Multiplayer. This game's multiplayer is quite enjoyable. There are several modes you can play, such as the battle mode which is then further divided into sieges and out-in-the-open battles, and the campaign mode where each player assumes the role of one of the major factions.\n\nCons:\n\n- Bugs. I've encountered several during my playtime and a few were really annoying. Among these were a multiplayer campaign getting stuck during a battle which could not be started or condeded, several factions repeatedly entering diplomacy with me turn after turn after turn in late game during a campaign to constantly tell me they have ended their military access pact with me (the same factions did this for several dozen turns), and suddenly entering diplomacy with myself after ending the turn and not being able to exit the diplomacy tab, having to manually shut the game's process down.\n\n- Restrictions. You aren't able to colonize most of the map depending on which faction you choose. This is an annoying feature as you can only raze (or sack, sure, but that's not what you want to be doing when you're trying to destroy a faction that is being problematic) most of the settlements which are then easily rebuilt by who ever finds themselves closest to the settlement and it limits the expansion of your territory. This has since been fixed by a mod that is growing in popularity, and there are already several versions of the mod depending on your preferences, and it allows you to conquer anything, anywhere. I have nevertheless listed it here because it's just an odd design choice. Maybe it worked that way in the tabletop game, I don't know, maybe it doesn't fit the lore, but if you give us an expansive world to conquer, let us conquer it! This is not the only restriction imposed on players as you also cannot play as any of the minor factions. You can only choose between the major factions which is kind of a bummer. Sure, these major factions have lots of bonuses the minor ones do not, but surely it would further add to the variety if we could play as any faction that is present in the game.\n\n- Balancing. With all of the variety, it is to be expected that some factions are better than others in some areas. For instance, the dwarves excell at ranged combat, and the Empire has war machines and siege weapons which all have excellent range and damage, and unlike the dwarves they have magic casters. Chaos doesn't have any ranged units, but that's okay, because their magic casters and all their other units more than make up for that. Vampire Counts have several really good units and can instantly fill their armies by raising the dead. The orcs need to constantly be at war and their Waaagh! more than makes up for that, their army being a mix of giants, casters, and lots of expendable infantry. And all of that is alright, the variety is greatly appreciated. But pit each faction against each other, and you will see how Chaos is blatantly overpowered most of the time, and how dwarves are impossibly slow (except for slayers, but you can't compare this to any cavalry unit) and don't have any effective counters to enemy archers and casters, and how the Empire's Steam Tank outclasses just about anything in both ranged and close combat. The balancing could use some work, not so that they all become equal, but so that spammy builds are less effective and each faction is really the best in one area, and not all at once.\n\nAll in all, this game is amazing and I recommend it to every fan of Total War, Warhammer, and strategy games.","May 24","true","46.0"," 36 of 63 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","36","63","2","0"

To keep things concise, the fantasy setting really lends itself well to the total war franchise as a whole allowing for lots of creative units (Based off of Games Workshops' Warhammer Fantasy Battle) and a new fresh world to campaign across. The map is nice sized for a vanilla game, the units are extremely varied and fun, each faction is very unique and the game is beautiful and much more optimized than Rome2/Attila. The one downside is the lack of statesmanship leaves much to be desired. Building chains are more varied than Rome2 but adjusting taxation and a few other intricacies have been dropped hoping to be added at a later date. Diplomacy is the same as it's been just a tiny bit more robust with options like confederations. Overall I give the game a 9/10, losing a point for lack of deep statesmenship that can be fixed a later point in time.","May 25","true","73.8"," 36 of 63 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","36","63","2","0"

It astounds me that people have this knee-jerk reaction if they run into the slightest roadblock. There has already been a patch for some of the initial problems. The game runs fine on my machine, a 2 year old laptop.\n\nI can't speak to the game itself, with it being so new, but I can speak to the people behind the game. The CA team have really outdone themselves to bring us Total War Warhammer.\n\nHow quickly people forget that CA bent over backwards to give us what we want for this game. Modding? They managed to make it happen despite Games Workshop's iron grip on their property. DLC? They felt so confident that they wouldn't need pre-orders to entice people that they offered it free for the first week so people could see reviews before buying and not be penalized for it. They even delayed the release of the game by a month to make sure that the game was the best it could be, rather than push a broken game out the door to meet a deadline. Review copies? The game was given to  critics and prominent youtubers weeks in advance of the release, and full reviews were out long beforehand so fans could make an informed decision.\n\nThe team at CA did livestreams, videos, blog posts, EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. For months leading up to release. They showed us as much of the game as they could. They were proud of the work that they had done, and they showed they had nothing to hide. They interacted with the community and listened to feedback, and we could see changes being implemented over time as the game took shape. I have not seen a game company as transparent and responsive as CA has been with this game.\n\nThey're planning on creating a trilogy of games based on this over the course of the next ten years! Do you really think they will screw up the first game in the series with that much riding on it? They know they have to knock it out of the park with this one or the whole plan falls apart.\n\nCA have listened since Rome 2. Attila was a lot of fun, and I have no doubt that I will sink many hours into this game too!","May 24","true","13.5"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

The graphics and the soundtrack are beautiful. However I don't feel like there is too much replayability with the game at this point. While each faction is very unique, I just don't feel like the game is all too difficult. Chaos needs more buffs, I'm more afraid of the other Norsce factions than Chaos Warriors itself. Cities look very beatiful on the battlefield but they all use the same layout and are actually very small. Buildings on maps are also underwhelming, cities like Altdorf and Nuln look like any other city. Overall I feel like there just isn't enough content in the game right now to be worth the 70 dollar pricetag it has, once they add more free-lc stuff or when modders add more mods to buff up the game; then it might be worth it. That being said I still think the idea of it all is really cool and I am eager to see what CA has in store for us.

Chaos incursions early and frequent to be really serious. The AI has no concept of banding together to fight off chaos invasions and it boils down to proxy wars as you use more northern cities to shield you. Not that ever lasts long because Chaos Hordes can easily outnumber the rest of the factions as they don't really rely on an economy to keep a fighting army. The game is very indepth and lovingly recreated vision of the old world but it doesn't feel like the old world. It just feels like 50 factions stuck on a map and told to get to it. None of the empires are this fractured in Warhammer and that means by turn 80'ish when Chaos is starting its invasions you'll still be fighting half the factions, while still trying to create a solid empire from the splintered heap of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥gery the AI tends to play as.\n\nBut don't let my dislikes put you off, its everything you'd want from a Warhammer game and total war systems have been adapted well to the format of the old world.

(It still loads slowly for me, unless I start in offline mode).\n\n- AVOID MULTIPLAYER (MAYBE) for the time being. The menu keeps freezing when I tried it two times. This occurs most likely cause of the network issues at hand due to a busy launch. I have seen other users have the same problem but I am not sure if it is very widespread.\n\nOnce you get into the game and start a campaign, however, you are quickly introduced to the setting as well as style of gameplay via an opening tutorial. My second battle was also a lot of fun, and the gameplay is what you can expect from a Total War game. Warhammer seems like a good fit for the style of gameplay TW offers.\n\nFor newcomers to Warhammer, but veterans of Total War, I'd recommend to try your hand at the Quest Battles, which - as far as I am aware - are 'historical' battles within the Old World. My knowledge isn't vast enough for me to say all of the battles are well-known in the tabletop variant.\n\nEither try the game now, accept some of the early issues, or wait for a patch or two. Don't want too long though - you don't want to end up playing Total War: Age of Sigmar once Games Workshop forces Creative Assembly to nuke the game from orbit in exchange for the new lore ;).\n\nEDIT: Changed review based on help from a developer and a comment.

Doom, Fallout 4, and this  have all had there fair share of whippings, but in the end they turn out to be awesome games. Reviews should be viewed by the % of the people that like it, not the grade itself.\n\nI have not seen this elseware, but this has a distinct Lord of The Rings style to it, with orc horns, Tolkeins map style, and the classic but not overdone fantasy that I enjoy. The campaign feels like Civ 5, and it sucks you in with the right amount of depth and choices. As a first Total War game, I am thoroughly enjoying learning and discovering the mechanics.\n\nThe real time strategy is slow enough that you can make large macro decisions rather than just mico management. This is what seperates it from say Starcraft, which is very fast paced and more about actions per minute. From my first loss, I redid the campaign battle differently, and got a very different outcome.\n\nRegarding technical issues, I am running on an i7 3770 3.4 ghz quad core, and a GTX 970.

My computers not especially great but luckily I'm not someone who gets hung up of graphics, which if you are able to run on the higher qualities are spectacular.\n\nCAMPAIGN\n(I've now done 100+ turns for each race and can say they're each unique and from the looks of things very replayable).\n\nI'm 60 turns into a Warriors of Chaos campaign. You don't capture settlements as Chaos, instead it's like the hoard system from earlier games but much more refined and just all round better. Once you've captured somewhere you can; loot it giving you money,  raze it which essential destroys it and increases the 'population' growth of your hoard, or if it's a 'Norsca' settlement you can convert them, giving you a military ally like satrapies in Rome 2 but they actually like you. It's a solid system that really makes you feel like your rampaging across the lands of the Empire.\nThe only other campaign I have running is as dwarfs, I'm 100 turns in with them and can say for sure that the play styles are very different not only because dwarfs work in the usual way of taking and holding settlements but also when fighting battles they are varied and interesting because of the huge differences in army rosters and stats.\n\nAI+BATTLES\n\nAI in general is a huge step up from past games, particularly armies. No more armies with 12 of the same unit, 5 of another, and 2 more + general , now there's sensible and pretty tactical variation of units and fighting them on the battlefield is much more engaging and interesting. Garrisons in towns and cities are also now actually decent which allows you to concentrate your armies on advancing and expanding, and on the flip side means taking new cities is a actually challenge for once.\nThe introduction of monsters and more importantly magic was something that worried a lot of people because of balance issues but after playing several battles involving both it would seem they have been well adapted to the game. Monsters don't destroy entire units but are still a force to be reckoned with, and can be effectively countered with magic (artillery if your dwarfs) or vice versa with monsters acting as tanks to absorb damage.\nLeaders, both Lords and Heroes, are key figures on the battlefield. Importantly they aren't insanely OP but are still powerful enough to have a impact on a battle. The levelling up system allows you to customise how you'd like to use your heroes. You can make them better suited to being like agents (spies, assassins, champions, and diplomats) or as lieutenants in battles.\nCombat is once again good, with charges having a proper weight to them and range units being effective yet not totally crippling, particularly artillery which is on a wide scale the likes of which hasn't been seen since Medieval 2. The mix of both strong melee and mixed range and melee factions means battles are challenging and aren't repetitive but there's none of what you had in past total war games where you see armies full of the best top tier units running about the map stomping others.\n\nMAP\n\nThe map is much larger than I'd expected and even thought there are only 6 races (undead, Chaos, Dwarfs, Green Skins, Empire, and Bretonnians) the fact that there are several 'tribes' of each means they don't all start fighting for space or make the map feels empty.\n\n\nIf I think of anything to add later I will.","May 25","true","60.7"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","13","20","0","0"

I was boycotting the franchise since rome 2 and i should have stuck with it.\nMany people said it was gutted but they still enyoed it a lot, probably the most out of all the installments of the series.\n\nI have not tried all the factions but what i've seen so far is that it gets super repetitive, real fast. Battle 5 was almost the same as battle 35. The sieges are a shadow of what they used to be and there is no strategic depth left on the big map. Basically every settlement you take you sack because otherwise you will never field more than one or two armies. Your movement is very restricted through the way attrition works. You leave your factions designated territory and your armies suffer, sometimes badly.\n\nThey tried fixing it through immersion (quests, perosnalisation of characters etc.) but that only helps a little. Your main characters never die permanently and you just follow a "skill tree" to take your character wherever you want. This game showed me one thing i had never realised: One of the aspects i liked the most about the series was that you had to form your generals through your actions. You can't just run around the world sacking settlements and then wanna be called "the just". While that personlization aspect sounds great in the beginning, you will soon follow a sort of "build" that makes your hero the strongest you can have. But they have to have flaws!!! That's the idea isn't it???\n\nI don't understand the reasoning behind not giving the dwarfs any cavalry, and the vampire counts no ranged at all. I'm not asking for super effective units but SOMETHING... If that is the only way you can add tactical depth than something is seriously wrong. Battles last less than 5 minutes again (I have seen orc units beak at the first artillery hit...) and it's all about clashing the heroes and having the better quality troops. With the dwarfs it is almost impossible to actually wipe a army off the map. You just don't have anything to run routing troops down. At least give me the option to add mercenaries or whatever...\n\n\n\nPros:\n- Spells add a cool but tiny part to the game\n- It is comparably bugfree, had no fatal crashes so far\n- It looks great\n- decent AI (not great but better than anything we had so far)\n\nCons:\n- Economy completely gutted (almost nonexistant)\n- Strategic depth of a Koi-Pond (shallow at best)\n- Character specialization follows a build and does not reflect actions\n- Almost no unit special abilities (spearwalls etc.)\n- Sieges competely gutted","May 28","false","21.4"," 150 of 281 people (53%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","53","150","281","9","14"

Smooth release, no gamebreaking bugs so far, stable as hell and fun as hell.\nEach faction feels drastically different, a nice breath of fresh air compared to before where you'd get a lot of recycled units and factions with slight differences. The RPG-like effect of the heroes and the quests are an amazing edition and I really hope they stay committed to it for the next Total War. As a friend of mine said, imagine being able to play as the romans and dealing with political intrigue with quests and stuff.\n\nCA have proven that they -will- listen to us, the supporters and buyers, and have pretty much fixed everything that people complained about in Rome 2 and Attila, especially the nonsensical aspect where you'd get punished for building high tier buildings. Good/bad news: no squalor. Some aspects of the game have been casualized a bit, but it's easy to get into and just, man, it's just great. I'd say it's the best Total War game since Shogun 2.

Really feels like it puts you into that section of the Warhammer world, and has really nice environments.\n- The way you level up/equip lords and use them in battle is really cool, especially considering the epic heroes of Warhammer lore; it gives you a chance to forge similar heroes in the flames of battle.\n- You can rename almost everything, other than factions and legendary leaders. Tiny feature, but still nice(I like to personalize my leader's army so he isn't running around with common soldiers).\n- Magic system is a nice feature; I feel like it is lacking in offensive spells that a single person can cast, but still refreshing and fun to use.\n- Real power struggle. Between the Undead, Chaos/Norsca, Dwarves, Bretonnians, Kislev, Border Princes, and provinces of the Empire, there is a lot of war going on, not just between these culture groups but with internal wars as well. It's nice, but can make it difficult.\n- Heroes(like the agents of previous games) can be used in battle now, which can be really nice depending on the situation.\n- Offers more customization with renaming, war banners that give abilities to a single unit, and lord equipment.\n- No more building upkeep such as food or public opinion; this is a questionable move in a game of managing your military and kingdom, but I like it. Puts more focus on war, which is naturally the key aspect of both this era in Warhammer and this game.\nLots of cool little things about the game, but sadly it is tarnished with a few LARGE bad things as well.\n\nCons:\n- A miniscule five playable factions, and you have to get the game within the first week or else you're left without Chaos, which is arguably the most important faction at this point in Warhammer lore. It is based around the final rise of Chaos and the End Times, so how can you leave out that entire faction?! A pathetic money grab by an increasingly greedy company.\n- Factions can only take over certain settlements, and Chaos can take over none. The Chaos part I don't mind, but in a game of conquest, how can you be severely limited on what you can conquer? I know it is part of an attempt to be very accurate to the lore, but still it makes war with most of the factions completely pointless other than as a waste of your armies. A very disappointing aspect of the game.\n- Unit variety sucks. They'll put 3 types of the exact same unit(just with different weapons) in for a faction, but won't add another, actually unique unit?\n- Naval warfare? Basically non-existent in this game.\n- Elves, Dark Elves, Skaven, and the Chaos Dwarves were left out, which were key factions within the same conflict that is depicted in the game. Not the vital nations, but still important both in lore and fanbase. You also cannot play as Bretonnia, despite the culture and nation being there; no doubt it'll be added as a crappy DLC pack designed to steal money that shouldn't be going to CA.\n- Along the lines of the upkeep thing, the game is very simplified in terms of managing your faction. Honestly the only two things you really watch out for are army upkeep and corruption(this is nullified extremely easily though, upkeep as well compared to the old games).\n- Complete lack of building diversity in regards to economy/support. This is not entirely bad, as it allows more war-time focus for a war focused game. Still, a notably negative feature overall.\n- In reality, this is more along the lines of an expansion than a full game. There is a similar amount of stuff to this game as there is to the big DLCs of previous games. CA is going through this phase where they drop and/or lock content, that way they can release it later in DLCs or separate full games to take more hard-earned money from their ever-loyal fans, despite the fact that it is content that should've been in the game from the start. It is pathetic, especially for a series that was doing just fine without bleeding its fans dry. Can't wait to pay extra just to add tiny blood effects to a WARHAMMER game! Seriously, it is just wrong.\n\nOverall, the Total War series is my all time favorite, I loved every game since the original Shogun and of course I enjoy this game a lot as well. Many nice features, but it is dragged down by a major lack of content that should have been there, and is dragged down by the poor decision making that influenced its production and release. Despite this, I would still suggest the game to any lovers of strategy games, Warhammer, or the Total War series. I love the game, in the kind of way that you love the one friend in the group that is an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ all of the time and doesn't really deserve your friendship, but has enough lovable qualities to make you keep them around. 7/10","May 24","true","78.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Because of this it no longer seems like a massive pain in the neck to conquer under developed territory\n•	The AI does seem better and battles are more challenging\n•	The races are truly distinct, while there are only 4 of them I would argue there is far more diversity in those four than any other Total War game.\n•	Magic is good.\n•	The touches like vampiric corruption are awesome, it really gives you the sense of an encroaching evil.\n•	Lords are actually damn good combatants.\n•	Watching your legendary hero ride in on a horse and knock another hero on his a** is surprisingly satisfying.\nBad:\n•	I have had my infantry have path finding issues when in settlements, this has been in pretty much every total war game since Empire. While it's not new it’s disappointing to see it come back for another installment.\nBut on the whole the game is amazing, truly fun and with no performance issues or crashes for me. 9/10\n","May 24","true","45.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I have been playing tabletop Warhammer and it delivers a stunning experience. The concept of "total war" really kicks in after Chaos arrives, when all the factions are warring eachother and the Hords of Chaos are pummeling your outermost cities.\n\nThe quest, item, ability system combined RPG with RTS, two concepts that I love. I actually felt that I accomplished sth, when Karl Franz aquired Ghal Maraz and Deathclaw. It made him stronger, thus defeating legendary lords such as, Grimgor or Kholek was a piece of cake.\n\nOverall this is a great game, it runs great (PC Specs on my profile), and it delivers an experience that makes you feel like playing an RPG with Total War intergration. As for the launch problems, if anyone remembers the pre-2007 era of gaming, we waited for several minutes (~25) to load certain games, not to mention we had to install them first via discs. People today have no patience, especially when companies fix the problems ASAP.\n\nThank you for reading this review. I hope that you will have fun playing this game too.\n\nFOR SIGMAR, FOR OUR EMPEROR KARL FRANZ.","May 24","true","10.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The game provides that huge varity in gameplay, but lack diversity in units for each faction (but thats why we got mods). While it´s lacking in diplomacy, as it´s quite hard for the orks to get good friends with anyone, but orks you are pretty limited to fighting and making sure you don´t loose every battle. This does lead to a big list of pros and cons, so I´ll do my best to get around all of them:\n\n+ Great preformance, already on launch (theres always someone, but you cant make everyone happy)\n+ Straight forward in gameplay - just kill these guys and then kill some more.\n+ Easy for new players, no need to have Total war experience.\n+ Mod support on release - made by modders like Magnar and Dresdner.\n+ Somewhat true to the lore and world of Warhammer.\n+ overall great potentual for "vs" or "coop" campaign.\n\n\n- Unit rooster is severly lacking! (Games workshop added what they had at the time on their webpage, but in-lore theres still tons of different units!\n- obvious additions of a million future DLC´s - besides the obvious elephant in the room (Looking at you Chaos DLC) there will clearly be alot more of that to come; blood, factions and units will surely recieve a DLC in the future.\n- Campaign is as of now, abit short. There only two ways to win the game: short - capture two towns and destroy Chaos or long = dominate everything.\n- Lacking in replay-ability. Sure, you can play everyone, but with just 5/6 factions, you can only "win" the game a certain amount of times before you done it all before. The victory conditions are also the same for each faction: same towns and destroy Chaos.\n\n\nAlot of things will be fixed/added via mod support, but Sega and Games workshop will still delete those mods that will be future DLC´s, but surely we all understand the world of gaming as we live in, as of now not having DLC`s is just weird for every developer out there.\n\nI got the game from a friend and not Sega, so no worries (I´m not paid to promote, sadly...).\n\nAll in all, I´ll give it a 5/7, it´s great, but not that great. If you want actual numbers = 7,5 / 10.\n\n\n","May 24","true","55.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","5","5","2","0"

If you are completest you now know what you are getting yourself into.\n\n-Additionally, the game has a new occupation mechanic. Basically, there are certain parts of the map which you cannot occupy and govern. In these regions your faction acts kind of like a hord. If you goal is to annex the world know that you cannot unmodded.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nChanges from previous total war\n\n-'Historical' battles are now part of the campaign instead of a seperate game mode. In past total wars I always felt that the game was missing a story to keep me going. At a certain point the all the battles just blended together. Having the quest battles in campaign helps in them down and adds importance to the campaign. Some of them feel a little odd in that there is no time limit or no conquences for failure.\n\n-General and agent customization: The agents and generals are now much more customizable with abilities and names. I feel far more attached to my leaders and morn their deaths. They can also join in armies and fight in battles which is cool.\n\n-Magic. The implications of magic are not as dramatic as one might think. The spells are interesting and need to be used strategically and do not feel spammy.  Ironicallly because the regular abilites are not limited by the magic pool it is the normal powers which feel spammy and poorly executed to me.\n\n-Fly units: These units are extremely moble, however they still require planning and strategy. They can be just as effective as well timed shock cavalry or as ineffective as poorly managed cavalry. Many times the risk is getting this units isolated.\n\n-Vanguard deployment: Some units can now deploy outside of the normal deployment zone making them excellent for scouting and ambushing.\n\n-Regional occupation: You can no longer paint the world in your colors. Instead of occupying everything it give you a reason to sack and raze areas, which I have never done in any prior totalwar game.\n\n-Seiges are focused on part of the city instead of the entire think. It's no better or worst than the older titles just different.\n\n-Allies actually appear to be helpful durring wars\n\n-Stability: For me the game seems very stable.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nProblems which are still the same\n\n-Battle AI has only minor improvements, but is still can only handle a narrow range of tactics from humans.\n-Campaign diplomacy still feels arbitrary\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRailroading\n\nSome people fear that campaign will be railroaded because of the defined starting possitions, quests and regional ocupation. However the campaign does not feel railroaded at all.\n\nWhat does feel railroaded is the battle plans. The factions are so speciallized that you have limited tactical options. This is not to say that the game does not require battle planning, just that a faction has a prefered military doctrine that needs respected.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWarhammer is the perfect setting for a total war game. Warhammer has flashy units and lore in a violent universe which is at constant war. Even the poor diplomatic system kind of works for warhammer. Warhammer includes races which play very differently from each other.\n\nWarhammer totalwar also is astep towards fixing one of my biggest issues with a total war game, battle context. The warhammer story arch and events add more context to battles.\n\nIf you are satisfied with past total wars you will be satisfied with this one too. If you are into warhammer, buy this it might be the greatest warhammer game for PC.","May 24","true","71.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It feels smoother, and the battles are much more organic than previous Total War titles have been... no more unit bunching with troops magically sliding into place as they jockey for a position in the fights. While this game may be running on the same engine as Rome 2, you'd never know it. They've really put a lot of care and attention into crafting this title, and it shows. Don't listen to the negative reviews. If you do, you're going to be missing out on a great game. And for all of the people complaining about performance...I don't know what to say. I have experienced a smoother gaming experience with better framerates than I ever saw in Rome 2 or Attila, even months and years after their respective releases. In both of those games my framerate would consistently drop to down to the low twenties and even teens when zooming in to get a closer look at battles...especially during siege battles which were notorious for tanking FPS. In Warhammer, I can zoom in all day and still retain buttery smooth playability (all on graphical settings higher than what I ever set Rome 2 or Attila to). The game runs extraordinarily well, both on the battlefields and on the campaign map. In my opinion, the game has been very well optimized. And just so you have my specs for comparison, they are: Intel i5 4690k, Nvidia GTX 970, and 16 GB RAM. Anyhow, I hope that after reading this you do decide to pick up this title, because it is well worth your time.

I have now at the time of writing this put 9 hours in to Total War:Warhammer.\nI will go over a short review from my personal experience with the game so far.\n\nI would recommend the game mainly for its Battles, wether that be online in custom games or on the campaign, this is the strong point for the game. Battles are specticles of Huge armies, awesome spells and monstrous creatures, everything you could hope for in large scale fantasy battles.\nSieges, as much as the initial idea of corner/frontal seiges upset me, I now enjoy them (not as much as previous total war games though) They arn't sluugish they are much faster paced than previous games and I enjoy seeing the back drop of a fantastic City.\n\nBad point and its something that bugs me greatly, to which it nearly tilted the thumb up to the thumb down, that is the campaign. It has the depth of a puddle, building ques are tiny and generally the lands you leave behind are going to be fine for income and happiness. The only good part is that you get to go into huge battles.\nThe new agent mechanic is great, being able to send agents to do tasks and then bring them into your army works well, that being said Agents need (I stress need) a lot more actions outside of sitting in amries. Assasination, Block and destroy walls, Thats basically everything.\n\n7/10 Needs better depth on the campaign, made up for with incredible battles (Just).","May 25","true","60.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Yes. A unit of Slayers refuses to go through the gate I've blasted open and insists instead to slowly climb the ladder on the wall next to the gate. The Orcish Horde I'm facing decides to wait for me to bomb them into oblivion, kindly waiting for my Dwarven units to get bored. The Chaos Champion decides to run ahead of his army and die in a last samurai style suicide run against my Empire rifles. A battle turns into a last ditch, 1000+ unit bull rush of the main gate and the game stutters. Just a small subset of things that have happened to me.\n\nNow, for the positive.\n\nAssuming you play on Hard difficulty or above, which I've always found to be the only way you don't get bored in the end-game, the AI usually fights and maneuvers with a ruthlessness that can be shocking. Especially early game, when that one super stack of units you have is your lifeblood.\n\nSpeaking of your units, they are bursting with character. I've never loved a total war army like my battered Dwarven legion. The lore, Book of Grudges game mechanic, and flavor text really makes you feel that this army of Dwarves are a clan fighting for survival. Normally outnumbered, fighting monstrous creatures, I actually cheered when they pulled victory out of their hat. Hoping those little animated sprites went home and drank their world famous beer.\n\nThe campaign map is wonderfully varied, and does a great job of creating points of constant conflict. I've felt that entire wars have been fought over key settlement, only for the victor to be too weakened to push the advantage. Essentially creating a narrative that is just like the lore of Warhammer.\n\nMonstrous units are a blast, and they don't feel like an instant win when you have them (I'm looking at you, Elephants from Rome 2). You are given a lot of ways to counter them, and are a fool if you don't account for them.\n\nMagic feels like an epic addition, but not something you can use to force a victory. Buffing the right right unit at the right time, creating the best magical effect for the given situation, and having the dumb luck that lets that tower of fire move in the right direction to maim a tough unit, it always creates a great tactical decision. Side Note: creating zombies as the Vampire Counts is GREAT!\n\nChaos feels like it comes a little early to the game. While it's a great outside threat in the same vein as Attilla, I would like a little more time trying to conquer and unite my empire.\n\nYour lords and named characters are a blast to have. Creating strong characters you grow attached to, who do not die of old age (which makes it terrible when they die in battle).\n\nThe quests for your Legendary Lords are... ok? While it's great to have these epic items of power, going to the far flung parts of the map with your Legendary Lord and his powerful army is a huge risk. And while you can teleport there for the battle, it costs 5000 currency, and that could be a lot depending on how your campaign is going.\n\nI feel like I've rambled, so I'm going to end this review with this.\nBuy the game. It runs well, it plays well, and it is truly a joy to play.","May 25","true","48.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Still a great game to play if u havent played any other in the series\n\nPros(im explaining each point since i read a number of negative reviews with opposing view points):\n\n+ Huge variety of units, for example Vampires: over 18 unit types, and each has its own purpose. Looking at the 3 "weak meat shields": A zombie is super cheap but weak. A skeleton is more expensive but has more armour and sits in a formation. A ghoul is also more expensive is not armoured but poisons the enemy (which makes them fight less effectively). And this translates to the rest of the game, each unit has its purpose, even if they might seem similar they are not, and the game does a decent job reminding u of this.\n\n+Each race is completely unique, Orcs can only train units when established in war camps in their own territories, u cant just train a unit even if u are in ur own territory. Vampires can raise undead where ever they are, they can raise more and of a wider variety near great battle sites. Vampires take attrition when moving through any "untainted land", so u cant just march into enemy territories and expect ur entire army to make the march, unless u spread taint into that land first. So even though there are only 5 races currently, dont let that fool u, each race has far more variety than any total war game before this, as opposed to the previos TW games where u would have 30 races that each have 5 different type of spear man that in essence is exactly the same unit except for a minor stat difference, when u use them u will have the same effect en masse.\n\n+RPG-like general and agent leveling and item customisation. Now u can actually collect and swap items between members, and they actually have decent effects. Same goes for your entourage.\n\n+Flying units, add a whole new dynamic to the battles, since u cant just protect ur flanks with melee troops, u need to watch the skies with arrows.\n\n+No aging!! Ahmagash i cant believe it took this long before we could stop worrying about our high level agents dying from old age!!! :D\n\n+Units have weight, so charging can actually push units around, and charging enemies in the flanks or rear has a huge impact (use of flying units included)\n","May 27","true","89.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

At it's current state I cannot recommend it, at least not while it costs £40, simply because while it is fun to play, after several hours the tedium starts to build, and I find it hard to justify the money spent on this (At this early point, I'd like to stress. I'm sure the game will improve vastly, like Rome II and Attila have, but until then this will stay a negative review).\n\nI'll be curious to see what price CA will charge for the Chaos Warriors DLC, because that potentially lifts the game from costing £40, to a grand £45.\n\nPros:\n\n- A.I is actually semi-competent for once, which is unusual for a Total War title\n- Spellcasters get a nice variety of spells\n- The magic system is very easy to pick up\n- The agent system is pretty nice, especially how you can deploy them as individual units on the battlefield\n- The horrendous system of having to balance unrest in Rome II and Attila has been removed\n-  Being able to customise Lords and Heroes is a great addition\n- Is actually somewhat decently optimised, as I get a solid 30FPS on my potato, which got a nice 10FPS from Rome II at launch\n- Units have weight, and cavalry once again packs a punch, which allows battle lines to move\n- Mods have proper support now\n- Factions have a nice amount of variety between them, although IMO the rosters are still slightly lacking\n\nCons:\n\n- As far as I've seen, CA have skimped out on the unit animations a fair bit - I'm particularly disappointed with the animations of Crossbowmen, as they are one of several units without reloading animations\n- Buffing spells have pretty terrible effects - just a fast moving 'airy' aura around them which disappears quickly. Personally I was hoping for something a bit more interesting, especially seeing how much content CA have skimped on\n- Settlements? Never 'eard of 'em. In my 6 hours of play, and countless battles ingame, I've literally only seen one settlement, and that's only because whilst I was playing as the Empire some Skaelings besieged Altdorf. If a battle commences over a minor town/city, then the battefield will be a randomly generated map, no different to attacking or defending out in the countryside\n- Being able to only assault one side of a settlement is disappointing, because it means that your tactics are the same more or less every single time, the only time it changing is when you get a new unit to play with\n- The 6-4-4 building system that Rome II brought in which is absolutely infuriating, and should be done away with\n- Trade is absolutely useless\n- Diplomacy is absolutely useless, although fair enough it's a Warhammer game, but defensive and military alliances should at least be useful for something other than just raising opinion of you to the point you can confederate with the faction in question\n- A lot of spells are unbalanced, although this will probably get patched soon\n- A lot of range units are unbalanced although this will probably get patched soon\n- CA shouldn't be relying on modders to add in essential parts of the game, like being able to occupy whatever settlement you'd like regardless of the culture (Human, Dwarf, Norsca, Greenskin etc). It's just more that they've not bothered with\n- NO BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD! (No blood or gore)\n- Chaos Warriors is still cut content\n\nA personal note is that I feel that the game feels a lot smaller in scale and depth than what was shown in trailers and videos by CA showing off the game (Which is to be expected I suppose)\n\nI cannot see where CA have put all their resources for this game. I really, really, really hope it's not towards DLC. I miss the glory days of PC gaming, where expansion packs actually added hours and hours to the game, and lots of new content, and in the case of Rome I and Medieval II, adding hundreds of hours of gameplay. Those were the days where you got over a dozen fully fleshed out factions from the very start, instead of 4 + 1 integral faction you have to pay for.\n\nAll in all, Total Warhammer is by no means whatsoever a bad game, but it isn't fantastic either.","May 24","false","8.1"," 163 of 307 people (53%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","53","163","307","4","6"

I've played Call of Warhammer for Medieval II and Mark of Chaos for PC. It's been awesome to see Creative Assembly provide a really quality game.\n\nPROS:\n1.) It feels very well optimized and the turns end quickly.\n2.) The factions are defined and unique. There isn't a copy/paste feeling that\n3.) The magic is varied and while it needs rebalancing for offensive magic, is a welcome addition.\n4.) The aesthetic of the towns and campaign map is amazing. This is the new standard for future Total War titles.\n5.) The AI feels more competent and logical. They attack when it's advantageous, they may broker for treaties and so forth.\n\nCONS:\n1.) There's still a need for an arcade option like in Rome I. The battles are very fast and almost overwhelming, especially with the addition of a new micro-management option (magic).\n2.) I don't know yet how this is late game. But right now units will break and come back quite often. This makes the pacing of the battles feel frantic. The balance needs looking into for a more cohesive experience. I want to be able to watch the battles from time to time or have formations retained.\n3.) I really did hope for a form of tabletop painter for units. I've always wanted customization in the vein of the Avatar mode in Shogun 2.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/manicado/recommended/364360/","manicado","Meownic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/manicado/","271 products in account","Product received for free\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vYPk-VJeVU\n\nTotal War: Warhammer was developed by Creative Assembly and published by SEGA. Total War: Warhammer was released for Steam on Tuesday 24th May 2016. The price is £39.99/$59.99. A press review copy was provided for The Hidden Levels.\n\nComing into this game I had no idea about Warhammer and the last Total War game I played was back in 2004 with total war: rome, long before I had a reviewing mindset. This review will be from a more novice perspective as I only had four days to do everything before game launch. I dedicated three days to playing the game and the fourth to writing the review and video editing. I played Total War: Warhammer for a total of 29 hours playing through most of the Empire Campaign as Karl Franz and almost gained victory on easy difficulty before I had to peel myself away from the game reluctantly. I spent the other remaining hours checking out the other offline modes but unfortunately did not have time to test out the multiplayer.\n\nTotal War: Warhammer is a Fantasy RTS 4X Turn based tactical game in which you control one of four factions in campaign ranging from the Empire, Dwarfs, Greenskins and Vampire Counts in a bid to take over lands and gain control of the world. The game is completely set in the Warhammer Fantasy world and has a very engrossing campaign mode as well as several side modes such as quick battles and quest battles.\n\nWhat I liked:Factions – There are four factions (five if you include Chaos Warriors) in which you can play as. You have the choice between 8 playable Characters ranging from Karl Franz to Mannfred von Carstein. After your choice of lord you can then hire lesser lords and use those to control in battles. I really loved the whole world and the mixture of factions all spread around. The diplomacy in the game is very fun too. The size of the world is absolutely enormous and can easily see you spending hours in scouring around the world attacking the Dwarfs to the east or Goblins to the south\n\nAbundance of Achievements – In total there are a whopping 143 achievements! Some of the achievements are pretty difficult for instance “Win a campaign battle in which you are outnumbered 10-to-1” to the more easier " Have 1 level 10 Hero.”\n\nEpic scale of battles – Zooming into the ongoing battles is really fun. You get to see all the action ongoing and it’s really impressive.  The one part of this game I really loved was Castle Sieges where you get to place archers on the wall and then zoom in and watch them fire down on the attackers. Attacking castles is also fun as you get to hire Siege towers and battering rams and watch them slowly approach the castle with nothing being able to stop them.\n\nDetailed tutorial – Right from the get go the game offers to give you great advice from the starter characters. If that is not enough there is also extensive help by pressing F1 which opens a really big game guide which takes you through the changes and a lot more.\n\nMod Support – Luckily the game supports user modifications which will really help somewhat with the life of the game and to bring much more spice. At the time of writing this review there are already several really good player modifications including “Conquer Anywhere” – which allows you to take over any Factions settlements. Normally you are limited to taking control of only your own settlements.\n\nQuick battles – I found this option really helpful for if you want to skip all the diplomacy and set up a quick custom battle on a battlefield between certain people. You can have up to 4v4. The game does start to get a little messy with so many troops on screen however.\n\nWhat I disliked:The leader’s portraits – If you take a look around the world you suddenly realise a lot of the people in the same factions all look really similar. It would’ve been much better to have more customisation on the leaders visually to really give them more depth to the characters in the game.\n\nDay 1 DLC Chaos Warriors  – I feel that the Day 1 DLC should’ve been part of the main game anyway. It seems a real cheap way to squeeze extra money from the consumers especially when you see them appear in campaign anyway. There’s an epic cut scene of them arriving and then you start hearing about their movements in the north with them razing villages and settlements. You question what is happening and can they really be that strong?\nWhen they do reach you, you then realise its serious. They are badass. Their troops and presence is enough to scare anybody on the field and everybody suddenly becomes best friends to take down the chaos. Only the toughest of people survive. I just feel with them added in the base game it would’ve felt like a more complete package. There are also Chaos Warriors achievements in the list.\n\nNord DLC? – There are also Nords at the north that seem very aggressive with everyone and waging war with everything they see. I’d imagine that they’d be added later as DLC or that they don’t let you choose them because it’s where the Chaos Warriors Spawn and you’d probably be obliterated by them very quickly.\n\nRazed Settlements - Taking over razed settlements should take coins only as it says in the description when you go to build the settlement. When you build the settlement it takes away treasure instead of coins.\n\nLack of scenarios – The four scenarios on the game are good and last long, however I wish there was more of a custom scenario choice where you get to choose where you spawn or which faction you can use. The game really limits you to who you can be and what you can choose. More freedom and customisation would’ve been perfect. I would have also loved to been able to create a custom character and a faction. This would’ve given the game even more content and added that extra replay ability.\n\nFrustration – There was one point in the game where I spent time in the over world trying to chase enemies around. I spent all that time saving for epic tank army and then everyone would run away and as I turn back they would also go back to their original place frustrating me. It seems they know always the perfect places to stand to stop you from ever catching them in a mistake. Unless they are vampires of course, they are dull enough to stand in your way.\n\nCamera angles – In the game there are two camera angles with one being a top down bird's-eye view called the strategic view and the other view just being a normal view where you can zoom right up close to the troops and have a little height to it. I wish the camera could have more of an angled approach at the battlefield because I find myself on the tactical camera which is not close enough and the normal camera does not tilt to the correct angle.\n\nOverall I really enjoyed Total War: Warhammer, my only qualms about it is lack of customisation and choices. I would’ve loved to have more control over who I played as and where I spawned. I really dislike the fact that Chaos Warriors was added as Day 1 DLC, when they could’ve easily been added to the base game. I would recommend this to most people as it really is a thrilling game with epic battles and much strategy involved.\n\nThe game has also made me interested in the whole Warhammer series and I will definitely spend time reading up and researching about Warhammer. Although there is an abundance of negative points on this review, I feel the game is one to definitely pick up. Seeing huge medieval battles really is my fantasy.\n\nScore: Buy it now.","May 24","true","31.6"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","2"

Units lack formations. I'm not saying I want a pike phalanx or other previous formations, but the game is too raw, its basicaly camp or charge especialy at multiplayer. Formations bearly matter, The Caos Warriors are so unbalanced that u just charge and the enemy is basicaly dead, that is ridiculous, not even counting the broken heroes. The campaign is horrible. I could not play for more then 30 minutes because of how disgusted i was. The HUD and the design is also a bit boring, it reminds me of 2005 world of warcraft. I love total war but I recomend waiting because im sure they will improve the game, like in rome 2.","May 24","true","21.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

There is no cinematic mode at all and no option to skip to a particular point in the battle (or if there is, I haven't found it).\n\nEdit: Alright, it's actually not just occasionally anymore. At some point, savegames just become unusable because they constantly crash in the loading screen.

I saw my cousin playing this game when I was only 12 years old and I was instantly hooked. When CA announced that they would make a fantasy themed Total war I had my doubts. I was not very familiar with the Warhammer universe, and with Total war I used to be a very conservative type of player. It had to be a historical era of mankind, otherwise it would suck big time. Boy was I wrong.... This, in my opinion, is a great Total war. I am not saying it is flawless or perfect, absolutely not, but it is a great Total war game.\n\nI miss the proper naval battles that Napoleon and Rome 2 had, not having my ballista boats to be a bully on the ocean is a shame. The lack in 'premade' formations for your army is a small point aswell. did not use the option that often but it was nice to have just in case. But in all honesty I can't think of many more negatives right now with this new Total war.\n\nThe game so far has been a great experience, the units are great, well balanced and look awesome. There are dragons, giants, rocket shooting dwarves and a bunch more. Especially the hero's are cool, all come with their own specialties and a nice talent tree. The battles are intense and impressive, if you use a nice sound system with a good surround and a powerful subwoofer you will feel like a true commander in the middle of a battle. And last but not least, the global map looks great, its detailed and always changing. Vampire lords try to spread corruption and settlements have racial based looks, I like it.\n\nMy rig is a fairly decent i5-4440, gtx 960, 8GB of RAM and I installed the game on a samsung evo ssd. It run very well, never had a gamecrash and smooth framerate with high graphics on. I can even alt-tab during the game without any issues, might sound like a weird comment but many games tend to freak out if you put them in the background for a moment.\n\nThis game gets my insignificant seal of approval, i spent 50 euro's on it at a local retailer and I have been very satisfied with it. If you like strategy games and do not specifically hate fantasy genres and your pc is not a lemming trying to do calculations go for it.","May 28","true","48.4"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","8","11","2","0"

Its the fantasy world at its best.\n+Great representation of armies and units from the original game.\n\nSure it might need a bit of tweaking and patches will fix things we poke holes through but it's a fun game and worth your time and money if you're a fan off Warhammer and the Total War series (Rome II excluded like me), then pick it up.

This is a very well done hybrid of Total War combined with teh Warhammer genre.  I can sincerely say that the old guard of Total war gaming will find this game comfortably familar while at teh same time Fantasy rpg elements are added without hindering the experience.\n\nIn all honesty, I have read through all the negative reviews.  One must approach these things objectively.  After first installation and running...I experienced a black screen....for about 45 seconds...then heard the thump of war drums.  My heart started beating as my knuckles whitened....would I fall on my own blade as others had and succumb to teh anxiety of "Failure"....but before I crossed over the river Styx...the loading screen grasped at my hand and lead me across.\n\nNot a single hiccup after that.  The negative reviews so far are not warranted.  I have not seen any that offer objective criticisms of the game.  My fellow warriors.  Patience is key....make sure all drivers are updated....let the game load and let it do it's thing.\n\nI am sure some will have legitimate issues...that is the nature of game development and with such a wide variety of hardware, issues will happen.  Take note....most if not all of the modders and youtubers who bring us joy and info on have already had the game.  Many issues will be ironed out very quickly, but at this time, I am not experiencing any.\n\nI am older gamer....have played every single Total War game and was a little bummed by Rome 2 as many were.

Then it's because its on campaign map. There will come more if you move your army or just do some action or fight battles. You wouldn't even see it's 40 fps if you didn't have it on the top of your screen. It plays alot better than ATILLA.\n\nTry it out and if it doesn't suit you, just refund.","May 24","true","21.2"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

Collecting gear is good fun, as it adds additional reward to defeating armies in battle. Also collecting gear through quest battles is a lovely addition as it adds a optional objective to the ongoing stuggle of your world. The quests battles are also matched to your current power, so you can get a nice even battle that will truly test your skills.\n\nThis combined with new units, a new world and much much more creates a fantastic experience for both veteran and new total war players.","May 24","true","51.2"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198015921564/recommended/364360/","76561198015921564","Erwin Johannes Eugen Rommel","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198015921564/","136 products in account","I think that Games Workshop and the Total War team got together and decided that they could maximise profits in an epic crossover that would encourage fans of both games to get involved. Unfortunately the result is a game that isn't sure what it is supposed to be. I was unsure about this game since I first heard about it, especially considering the £40 price tag but of course in the end thought I would give it a go. You can see on my profile the time I have put into Total War games and that's not including the ones before Steam so please keep in mind that this review is from that perspective. Maybe for someone who is new to the series this game could be seen as a gateway to the other games but I think if you played Atilla or Rome 2 after this you would be overwhelmed at how different (and better) they are. IMHO this is basically a Total War lite game. Almost all the features that made Total War unique and different to other strategy games have been removed or completely changed in both the campaign and battle maps. I was shocked to find during my first battle that I can no longer even put my units into loose formation! Fortunately this mattered little since I quickly discovered the real time battles have now been turned into a successor to Battle for Middle Earth 2. The idea of deploying your army strategically before the battle and using the terrain is now a distant memory, replaced by a laughable mess as helicopters, dragons, eagles and ghosts zoom across the map, lightning bolts fall from the sky and incinerate your archers, giant trolls smash through your defensive lines and random vortexes appear to suck your carefully placed ambush into the depths of oblivion. Granted it all looks very pretty but that was never the point of Total War!\n\nOn the campaign map I also found this to be an issue, as you will often encounter armies that are less than half the size of yours, only to discover when you attack them that you cannot win as they have 2 units of monster trolls. So with only axemen and archers and one champion/spy to use how are you supposed to plan any kind of strategy? All you can do is spam build armies and try to overwhelm them with numbers (just like BFME2 or any other C&C style RTS). The campaign map does look very impressive and the music is absolutely amazing, but it seemed with this game that every time I noticed something good, something bad immediately came along to cancel it out. The developers seem to have gone to the trouble of including a huge number of factions as they usually do but this time none of them are playable and their culture and military are all identical. All the units are the same for every race, regardless of their faction.\n\nFamily trees are gone, champions/spies etc are gone replaced by a one size fits all hero unit, politics are gone and the standard diplomatic options you are left with feel like a pointless afterthought. Food production has been reduced to 0 importance as has trading with other factions and acquiring different resources, navies have been removed and the story is advanced by moving your army where the computer tells you in order to fight a "famous battle" that apparently has nothing to do with anything else that is going on. For example, as the Dwarves I was told that to advance my story I needed to travel north to fight one such battle, so I sent my King and his army off to the flashing blue dot. When they arrived the battle was "Your forces have been ambushed by a great orc horde in the underground caverns, we must fend them off!" Well hang on a minute, if I hadn't got the message that I needed to go and fight the battle then I wouldn't even have been there so how can it be an ambush? Why am I fighting in the underground caverns when that isn't even where I was on the map? Why do any of these questions even matter when my own army was destroyed by the monster trolls yet again only to be saved by 2 platoons of Dwarf helicopters that have somehow managed to fly down a mineshaft(???).\n\nI must try and find some more good points so I suppose I could say they have really focused on the rpg element of developing your heroes this time which is great in principle, but yet again, once you realise how simple the battles have become, having a general with a +15 charge bonus spell or melee defence buff just seems pointless. This means that instead of watching your heroes develop into a particular type of tactician and tailoring them to the units in your army as you could in Atilla, you are now simply picking random abilities from skill trees of literally hundreds of spells with no real tactical goal. The grand campaign has been removed, replaced by a vague story driven campaign for each faction in which you are only allowed to attack one race. Playing as the dwarves I am immediately informed that I can only declare war on the greenskins and my sole objective is to destroy them. Any thoughts of deviating from this objective are quickly removed on discovery that the map is designed with mountain passes in such a way that I have to follow a set route, making tactical army movement or ambushing impossible. The towns themselves are now part of the map so the visible growth of the towns into cities from Attila and Rome has gone, pretty much the whole board game feel of the campaign has been destroyed. There is little need to check your faction summary pages now as there is no longer any useful information there. I don't know if the developers felt that these elements wouldn't appeal to new players but it was a bad idea to take them out, watching your families marry, have children and evolve into great dynasties were some of the best parts!\n\nBattles for towns are now forced sally out and are all fought in the same generic bland landscapes with not a building in sight. Some of the big towns do look really good when you actually get to them but they are few and far between. All in all I think the creation of this game was driven more by financial motivation than by the desire to make a really great crossover. Finally it is also worth pointing out that the graphics are very impressive and without a doubt the best part of the game, unfortunately this too is let down by the repetitive animations and the removal of 1 to 1 unit fight animations so that if you zoom in on what looks like an epic melee battle, you will basically be watching 50 units doing the same move over and over in the general direction of the enemy.\n\nP.S\nCharging another £6 for the Chaos faction (The MAIN ENEMY FACTION in the game who are even mentioned in the opening cinematic are DLC, that's like having a Star Wars game where the Empire are DLC) when the game itself is already £40 is just incredibly insulting to all of us that have supported Total War since the first Shogun, very disappointed.\n\n-------UPDATE--------\n\nI got a refund and bought XCOM 2, ####### sweet.","June 5","false","2.0"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

I bought most the games in between and to be honest I didn't like them anywhere near like Medieval 2 and Rome.  Rome 2 was very upsetting and still is to me, even with the bugs fixed its not too fun.\n\nFigure I should probably elaborate for this game.  They mostly fixed collision as in when I watch human v human its no longer pathetic like before.  Seriously...this still makes me fairly upset every time I think about it since it took the devs this fricken long to fix that issue and I'n starting to feel really upset about it again now...  Anyway, there is some weridness with some of the different races fighting like dwarves vs orcs but its all forgivable and it tends to err on the fun side.\n\nThe stupid crap was taken out from city management.  I generally HATE when games streamline their features(looking at you dragon age and mass effect,) And you could say its been dumbed down but honestly none of the compexity in recent games was really needed.  Now you pick the buildings you want for the goals you want and you don't have to take the time to balance different negatives and positives and spend more time on positioning armies, battles and diplomacy.\n\nThat being said!  This game will be a adjustment for veterans.  If you decide to play on a higher level difficulty you can't just muck about with military power as the game limits your army building capacity somewhat compared to previous games.  Pick your strategic direction for your campaign and make sure that you are pals with everyone that is not your target.  Then build additional defenses on your backside just to be sure.\n\nAnother tip for veterans.  Devs took additional steps to countering your heavy infantry and heavy cavalry, you have been warned.  Branch out, diversify your army, or else.\n\nI do have complaints, but I consiter them to be minor. One is that in your quick formations all the swordsmen are on the left side, and all spear are on the right.

If you've played any of the Total War titles before, this one is going be very familiar, with a few changes to fit the title into a fantasy world.\n\nThe game comes with four distinct race/factions, each one playing different than the rest. Although this could create a wide variety of race balance issues, so far it has not. I started my first game with the Empire ( human ) faction, proceeding into it about 75 turns before realizing strategically, I wasn't going in the right direction. The great thing about the game is that you can go in any direction that you want, however it "encourages" you through goals and quests along a rough path to victory. I decided to start over, changing my tactics and strategy and did a little better.\n\nI've also started games with the greenskins ( orcs/goblins ) and the vampire counts ( undead ) achieving the intial goals of establishing myself in my home province. A great thing about each faction is that you feel totally immersed within it. The orcs are warriors big on warring with everyone, and the undead have a mystical, dark magical property. You'll either find a favorite or do as I'm doing, play around with each race. Unlike previous titles, choosing a faction is far more than just getting a different set of units.\n\nThe battlefield mini-game has perfected itself over the years and you'll find the A.I. is very good at tactics, leaving very little room for error. Unlike you, who can be distracted at one end of the field and miss something on the other, the A.I. is almost too good at tactical combat. Fortunately, you can pause or move time slowly to allow you to have better control. If you're a good tactical general, you can overcome odds and win.\n\nSince I just got the game this weekend and haven't gotten too far down the technology tree, I can't say yet how the end game units look or operate. I can only say, so far so good. The game runs nice and clean without any bugs encountered yet. The learning curve is nice and easy. Choose the right difficulty level and you'll feel challenged but not overwhelmed. Having said that, the game may be hard for younger players. I'd say 13+ would do fine with it.\n\nSo in summary, its a great game so far with no signs of turning South, and well worth the money.\n\nedit - OK I'm in the mid-game now playing the vampire lords. So far, still fun! The Chaos Lords are a real pain though. Think of them as an "end of the level boss" you have to beat down in order to keep going. It does add a twist and makes the game as a whole more interesting. I'm just hoping I can defeat them utterly and be able to move on.\n\nAlso on a side note, I did start the dwarf faction and found them not to be easy at all to get started. Unlike other factions, while you're trying to dominate the neighboring dwarves, your sworn enemies the Orcs will severely dampen your ability to do this. The easiest faction to start out with is the Empire.","May 29","true","58.7"," 14 of 23 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","14","23","0","0"

The fantasy elemnt makes each battle and skirmish a visual treat and rather than auto-resolving some easy wins i played them just to see what it looked like. Magic has een balanced really well so that it matters without feeling too powerful and the fantasy units such as dragons and giants are lots of fun to use. I find that on my decent spec laptop I am able to run it without any issues and the loading times are lightning quick, which will amaze any of those who remember the loading times of Rome2 when it first appeared.\n\nThere are a few issues I' not keen on, such as the economy. It seems they have massively stripped back on economy building which means that even with plenty of territory you can'y field too many armies, this gets more and more difficult as the turns roll on and you expand more and more but hopefully someone will mod this if, like me, you find this limiting. I am finding some fram rate drops but I mostly play for the gameplay so this hasn't bothered me overly.\n\nOverall I think this is a wonderful new addition to the TW series and a must have for all TW fans out there. I would advise getting this whilst the Chaos DLC is still free.","May 24","true","49.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198057620573/recommended/364360/","76561198057620573","Huge Metal Fan","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198057620573/","179 products in account","So far I have played this game for 6 hours after having owned it for 6 and a half. I have played a single campaign so far as the Empire and my review is based off of my experience so far. I may update this depending on how my experience goes.\n\nTL:DR It's good but has some balance issues in my opinion. Unless you're a huge fan of the Warhammer and Total war series like me, chances are it's not worth £40/$60(?) that it costs. Wait a bit and pick it up on sale, unless you are able to spend £40 on a game with no issues.\n\nFirst off, my system specs.\nCPU: i7 4790k clocked at a standard 4Ghz\nGPU:GTX 980\nRAM: 16GB DDR3\n\nLaunch was standard and simple. No issues and was quick and smooth. Quickly checked options and found they had been set to Ultra so I decided to keep it at that and see how it goes. Upon choosing your faction and difficulty you can do a practice match and I did choose to do this. Game runs near perfectly and I haven't even updated my drivers for it. Good FPS, good shadows etc. Smooth and units  look much nicer than in previous games and appear to fight in a more individual manner which is nice.\n\nBattles are too easy though. That's my one complaint.Almost no skill is required as long as you have some spear in the front, ranged units behind to support and cavalry to flank with you break the enemy almost instantly. It's ridiculously easy. The campaign itself though, with politics and diplomacy is a bit more complicated in some ways. Some things aren't  clearly explained so you end up having to figure it out and sometimes reloading to retry things. Irritating but not game breaking.\n\nI haven't fought the dwarves yet and so far have only just engaged my first greenskins within the campaign, having spent my first 30-40 turns simply trying to reunite the empire. I'm not completely impressed with with the confederation option. So far I've failed to do force another faction to join me despite trying to be nice and also trying to force them with my military. Money is a lot easier to get flowing but my advice is that you need to make some serious land grabs quite quickly and to stay away from the global recruit options.\n\nI'm going to try and play the Empire campaign a bit more and then I'll try some of the other factions though I am quite enjoying the Empire and have no real desire to play as the dwarves etc. Greatsword infantry OP af though Handgunners are underwhelming there is a mod which makes them do more damage, have a longer range and also have a longer reload. I would suggest downloading it.\n\nWould I recommend this game? It's £40. That's a lot of money and I try to aim for the £1 per an hour of entertainment and I can see myself easily sinking a few hundred hours into this game. Yes, I would recommend, especially to Warhammer and Total war fans alike. If you aren't a Warhammer fan and are new to the total war series I would suggest either waiting for this to go on sale or to try an older Total War game first.\n\n8/10. Has a few problems but I've already found mods that adjust for them and expect further modding will take this game to untold heights. It ticks most of the boxes for a nerd like me.","May 26","true","56.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

My rig is mid-range at best and I still get pretty smooth FPS after a driver update, even in big battles and with magical effects up the whazoo. No CTDs or obvious bugs thus far either, albeit I get long load times but I'm not using an SSD.\n\n-Looks good in motion. Animation work is pretty great across the board, especially the collision of heavy cavalry which is impactful. Large creatures are also superbly animated. Some of it might look too cartoony or blobbish, but it's Warhammer so it fits.\n\n-Battle times are on the short side. Even a 20v25 unit Chaos vs Dwarves battle doesn't last 10 minutes. Which is annoying because you barely have time to enjoy the aforementioned animations, and basic units can die very, very quickly.\n\n-AI is actually pretty competent, I have to say. It will use its cavalry decently, attempting to outflank you whenever possible and making a beeling for your siege weapons if you leave a gap in your formations. On the campaign map, it will attempt to raid you and attack weaker settlements if you let it, and will initiate diplomacy if it is in its interest.\n\n-Factions feel and play very differently, so the somewhat smaller unit roster actually feels larger than in typical Total War games somehow. Some factions are still missing key TT units however (Knightly orders for Empire, Blood Knights for VC, Marks of the various gods for Chaos), albeit DLC might change that.\n\n-Magic is weirdly balanced. Big bad vortex spell look flashy but are mostly useless since they deal little damage if they don't just wander off; meanwhile single-target spells can kill even mighty heroes like Grimgor in a few pinpoint casts that you cannot prevent, making the Lore of Death extremely powerful. I'm sure there are other balance issues too, but haven't played enough to really say. Dwarfs do seem extremely tough at the moment, only Chaos and their elite infantry seem to have a chance of breaking their lines.\n\nAll in all, a very fun experience thus far. I may revist this once I've played more.","May 24","true","60.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Total War: Warhammer has improved the series in several ways, but is missing some of the tactical options in prior games.\n\nPros:\n-An incredible improvement on combat. Combat now is far more fast paced. No more do entire units watch the fight as the front line is the only part of the unit engaging. Charging is way more powerful and the impact of the units is impressive.\n\n-The campaign unfolds an entire story before you. Each of your heroes and Lords hold so much value that it is horrifying when one is lost.\n\n-A great take on hero power and magic.\n\n-AMAZING CINEMATICS. The game looks amazing. From giant trolls throwing and smashing soldiers to comets falling onto the battlefield.\n\nCons:\n\n-The financial system...\n\n-Units are far more limited on "abilities" (I.E shield wall, pike wall, etc.)\n\n-AI can, at times, be pretty dumb. On a castle attack that i launched, the remaining defenders within the city center stood completely still as my crossbow men fired on them. I won the battle from letting my ranged units simply pick off the infantry.\n\nI'm sure there are far more pros and cons to this game, but i want to keep this review fairly short. All in all, this game is a great investment. The whole Total War system feels cleaner and more fast faced. The units look awesome and the combat is fluid.

The improvements to the building of your cities is leaps and bounds better than anything Total War has to offer currently. Everything in the Tech-tree building is something I wish had hit home with past total war games, years ago. Its amazing.\n\nBesides absolutley loving everything about Legendary Lords, I'm also loving everything about regular lords and the heroes you can recruit. Being able to spend the time to level them up and get them geared makes it almost heart breaking if you lose them.\n\nAnd siege battles, being one of the most challenging aspects of the game, are a huge success in gameplay for my book. I do wish there was a perk or tech that you can get or research to help speed up the construction of siege equipment, if only buy a couple turns.\n\nMy only complaints are the models for the units, all they do is really swing at each other and there really isn't a true battle going on, something I've enjoyed watching since it was introduced back in Medieval 2. Also, a disappointing part is that when a Legendary Lord and the enemy Legendary Lord meet in combat, its not the legendary fight you'd expect it to be. Its just a "you hit me, I hit you" slug fest thats boring and doesn't mean anything at all.\n\nOne last good thing for the review before I wrap this up, Co-Op multiplayer campaign is 1000x better then what it was in Rome2 or Attila. I felt in the past two games that co-op was just a dragging point of gameplay with 4-5 highlights that you can remember. With the help of a mod, TW:Warhammer Co-Op is amazing. Me and my friend have already put in 60 turns into our empire campaign today.

Chaos warriors cannot settle, VC lack missile units but can quickly resurrect units from the campaign map) and revitalizes the series by taking design risks that pay off.

To rank up and get the giants and bigger monsters u need time, keep fighting recruit more lords then increase ur growth. Later on in the game if u complete more objectives u can recruit legendary lords as well (which u couldn't choose at the start).\nMultiplayer is amazing u can put any types of army and lords, any value of currency and literaly use ur tactics have a mayhem of a time. You need good comunication with ur mates or ull be the one attacking while he'll be staring at the sky how beautiful this game looks.\nGraphic wise this game looks Beauuuuutiiiiiifulllll. Runs Ultra all settings at 60fps or above using 980TI and 4770K at 1080p. There might be more things this game offers that I would've might missed to include it, but this game is HUGGGEEEEEEEE u'll be playing this for many weeks and months from now on.\nFinally this game is a must for any who crave for epic battles and monsters by their side(and all who love LOTR franchise)","May 25","true","88.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Anyone who played TW in the past and then came upon the beauty that was Shogun 2, that is how I am feeling right about now.\n\nPerhaps the BEST part about this game, for us coop players, is that when the game desynchronizes instead of throwing you out it asks you and the other player if you want to attempt to resynchronize. Which was ♥♥♥♥ing mindblowing to us, in the past we would have been thrown out of our game (mid-turn even) and lose unnecessary progress in the process but NOT with this game! 10/10\n\nSieges feel very simplified, it is all about holding the walls and when defending you can feel that when they do breach through your gates it feels like your battle line (up top) is about to collapse because now you have to divert forces if you hadn't already.\n\nThe campaign feels very good too, the AI is finally competent enough to know when to back away from you instead of suiciding their armies and when they can they try to overwhelm you. And ♥♥♥♥ing finally when the AI is desperate to make peace with you after having you beat the living ♥♥♥♥ out of their big army they actually offer you large sums of money in return for peace, it feels like the AI has gained a "humble" trait if you will.\n\nThe only downsides that I have noticed thus far is that you can't really play coop in vanilla, unless you want to play head-to-head. However I found it disappointing when playing as Vampire Counts and my friend as Dwarves that it was practically impossible for me to kill him because I couldn't settle any dwarven holds to act as forward base, not to mention the ♥♥♥♥ing lack-of-corruption attrition which forces you to go through their lands in raid stance which makes a trip from your capital, to theirs take about 7-8 turns. Meanwhile they can tunnel around you, attack your capital, raze it, then return to their home and be still on time to defend from the attacking Vampire forces...\n\nI can't speak for any problems with the other factions, but I imagine playing as orcs (who can only conquer orcish or dwarven settlements) in a head-to-head against humans is equally as painful. There are ofcourse mods to fix this which brings me to raise the next big bonus: Steam workshop support! Must I say more?\n\nAnd a personal nitpick of mine, I absolutely dislike it that every unit (besides monsters and artillery I think) can spawn ladders infront of them, in the literal sense, and climb a city's wall. I would have much more preferred to have seen ladders being a constructable siege item, just like previous installments. Maybe a future mod will change this? Who knows.\n\nAll in all I think the game will be very enjoyable for total war players and perhaps abit more friendlier & welcoming to warhammer fans who are new to this style of game.","May 26","true","113.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

My specs are an I3 3.4 750ti 2gb graphics card and 10gb ddr5 ram and as far as performance I get 60-30 fps on medium graphics settings but even at those setting it looks really good and only get frame rate drops during big battles. I hear Nvidia drivers need some work with total war warhammer so I expect the performace to get better as patches/drivers are released. The campaign is fun and challanging also the AI is better then it ever been in total war they can really give you a hard time in battles and also on the campaign. The new sieges are fun I did not think I would like them from what I saw but they are actually pretty fun I got to say. Overall the game is amazing I cant say enough how blown away I was by how well it ran and thats day 1. CA is famous for supporting there game years after release and patching to perfection but with such a good base to start with I can wait to see this game in a few months and after some patches.

Very mountain bladey to the degree of controlling an army then waging battles with said army, the only difference being you don't outright control a main character, and engage in real time first person battles. However, it is a real time strategy none the less. This is the first game of Total War I have ever experienced, the reason being I do not like games that require turn based strategy, and I didn't realize the depth of micromanagement, as well as making the right choices, to create the right outcomes for your faction. A lot of trial and error, but very rewarding once you get the feel. Total Warhammer is something I can immerse myself in for many days to come. I have always liked Chaos, and this gives me a nice Chaotic fix. 10/10 would eat the world again.\n\nEDIT 1.) It took me roughly 50-60 hours of gametime in order to understand the mechanics of the Chaos Warriors. Keep in mind this is my first Total War, so that attributes to the time spent. I didn't realize Chaos Marauders are to be used as fodder for the enemy, kind of like the Romans using lower level units then higher level as the battles progressed. I tried using high class high tier units as if I was playing Mount and Blade Warband, while focusing on building a mass of Huscarls to destroy the Sarranids... Chaos requires variety... And micro-managing.\n\nEDIT 2.)

I was actually extremly sad when my main non-legendary lord bite the dust after holding the line in the Eastern Oblast of former Kislev reals from the Chaos horde.  Chaos horde is awsome too!  It is like the Mongols or Timriud from Medieval II except this time everyone is mostly willing to work together as they are a bigger threat.  Espacially if you let them grow and raid early game!  It was a fun battle with Chaos and it's minions in a raze for raze of the Northern wastes and Kislev.  Gave me an epic hard fought victory banished the last corrupt minon horde of Chaos.

They fixed the issues with Rome II and Attila, at least on the performances side. This game runs sooo smoothly even on my PC wich is a little bit old.\nThe game also runs perfectly on high settings for me.\nThese are my specs: Sapphire Dual X R7 265 as GPU. An Asus M5A97PRO as a motherboard. An AMD FX 6100 as a processor and 8 Gb of RAM. The game did not crashed. It never did.\n\nOn the gameplay side however you will not "feel" the strategies and the tactics we all used to set in previous Total War games. In siege battles you can only attack form one or two sides of the city, even in cities which should have more walls. No food mechanics for settlements. There is no variety that should help you setting different strategies depending on the map layout. Units of the same category feels pretty much all the same in terms of statistics like the Longbeards and the Longbeards (Great Wepons).\nThere's no reload animation for units like Musketeers, Thunderers or Quarrelers also no real way for the units to descend wall, they just teleports. It kills the realism which the Total War series was based on.\n\nOverall it is a very enjoyable game.","May 24","true","62.8"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/elbro/recommended/364360/","elbro","Junta","http://steamcommunity.com/id/elbro/","579 products in account","The best Warhammer Fantasy Battles game we have on PC\n\nAnd a great Total War game too. There are fewer races in here than what previous games in the series offered, however all of them are vastly different from each other in how they play with their army rosters offering a wider variety of troops.\n\nThe game is more hero centric this time, with army leaders being a tough to crack unit themselves, being able to carry various items improving their physical and magical side, as well as getting followers granting various bonuses either to an army in question itself or a region it is located in. There's a good choice of spells too, however they could've been more powerful to make a more noticable difference on the battlefield.\n\nHowever there were some simplifications made compared to other games in TW series. Economics are much simpler now with a static background income together with income from cities, quests or your actions. Every infantry unit carries a ladder during sieges now, which makes them take less time and be slightly easier for the attacker.\n\nTactical AI is pretty good, properly countering your attacks, exploiting the terrain and flanking with its mobile units. On a strategic map AI is also considering its chances pretty well, trying to send its stacks into battle when it has chances to win. And because the commander is pretty tough - in a way it solves a problem with a dead or wounded leader demoralizing the troops right away.\n\nIt is also the first Total War game where I truly enjoy playing custom battles, since being able to create your own army out of Warhammer units and fight another Warhammer army is very enjoyable. And then there are also single scripted scenarios depicting battles from Warhammer lore which are great too.\n\nThis game is a much needed breath of fresh air for the TW series, get it now.","May 30","true","53.4"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","10"

Way too expensive and no friends ever had them.\n\nThis total war game is great! Each faction plays so differently from each other.\n\nThe Empire has standard units and some neat artillery. Their infantry and cavalry are armored and hit hard. They even have some magic.\n\nThe Vampire Counts are my favorite to play. I love all the neat cool monsters that they have. They have no ranged uints however. Also, their lreaders are very easily assassinated. I had over 15 Lords killed by enemy agents in one campaign. I love how they get to turn the map into Evil Lands of Death!\n\nThe Orks are a lot of fun. They get WAAAAAGGHHH! armies that add to their power. They tend to be more work as their armies must Raid to keep their \'fightiness\' high. It is possible to raid in friendly territory although it makes the towns unhappy.\n\nThe Dwarves are good. Most of their earlier units are pretty much the same until you get the late game forces. They have no cavalry, which makes catching the missile units the AI builds a pain. However, they do have very good artillery.\n\nDid not care for the Chaos faction. They are really hard to play. I prefer fighting them, but they have few armies to be honest.\n\nAll factions get research, which is really cool. Also, Lords and Heroes can level up and get cool new skills to use.\n\nThe map is great, with all sorts of twists and turns = what looks like a direct route is not.\n\nHowever, I do unlike how the AI armies get to move and attack and move again so far. As the player you cannot move much after attacking but the AI gets to. It is currently impossible to catch a running AI army, they move much further than the player units.\n\nAnyway, it is about time a FANTASY Totwl War was released. This is a good game. I hope it gets even better over time.","May 31","true","72.4"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

Not used for anything. (Such as iron needed for weapon research or Stone for monument/special buildings and so on.)\n-Missing Naval battles.\n-Missing Generals.\n-Low damage of magic, missiles, artilery and monsters (Which is okay for balancing but Id love a mod to increase the damage for atleast campaign battles.)\n-Lack of voice acting.\n-Allies are not working as allies. Do not declear war against your enemies and just ignore them/letting them pass/attack/raid/destroy you.\n-Lacking political features such as gifting cities or threatening.\n-(No trust system in politics) When breaking long alliances it literally does not affect anything. So you can just break any alliance without the AI losing trust in you :/ in the next 3 turns start another military alliance, after you burnt his towns.

Important Icons are scattered all over the place.  On some dialogs the dismissal button is a checkmark in the middle of the dialog, other times it's on the bottom right.  You have menus that jump up from buttons, but look just like buttons, menus that disappear before you have a chance to click the option you want\n\nThe AI:  The AI is essentially like playing turn based chess.  It will choose the softest spot to hit you every time.  It knows everything you do.  So if you start a siege half way across the map with your main force, don't be surprised when 10 different faction armies suddenly make their way through the fog of war and come take half of your territory.  It's really irritating when your allies then come retake the stuff you lost and you have to declare war on your allies to get your territories back.\n\nCut Scenes: The cut scenes were actually pretty decent\n\nThe Tutorial /  Intro:  It wasn't super bad, but the interface and how everything is laid out made it hard to follow.\n\nGeneral issues:  There's this really annoying issue where if you have a Hero (not to be confused with the Leader of your Army) merge in with your army it will somehow always be selected by itself at the beginning of the turn and you'll think you're moving your army when in reality you end up removing your Hero away from the army.  The AI will absolutely do everything it can to slay the Hero whom is now all by itself because its movement is higher than the Army and you won't be able to remerge them until next turn.  So I spent a lot of time clicking off my army, or pressing escape, and then re-selecting my army to move it.\n\nI played multiple games on Normal, the AI is rediculous.  It will move just out of reach every turn.  It will exploit every mistake or mistep you make with surgical precision.  The only variability, or chance you might survive such a brutal, relentless AI, appears to be in the way it determines winners within battles.\n\nSomehow the AI players get to obliterate your hero even if you lose a battle and are retreated a few spaces away.  It seemed like every time I lost a major fight with my main force my hero dies, whereas when they lost a major battle with their main force their hero always had a chance to flee far, far, away.\n\nOtherwise, it's just battle chess with better graphics and units.  I would wait for the price to come down before purchasing this game, it's definitely not worth $59.99.","June 3","false","10.1"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","13","22","0","0"

Running the game on my 3 year old toaster and took heed to the load warnings in the comments. After a 2-3 minute black screen wait upon starting the game, I was greeted by a high quality cinematic with solid voice acting. Interface is smooth and polished, however lags a bit when I try to open the public chat from the menu -- I'm assuming this is due to servers being a bit overloaded on launch as mentioned by the devs.\n\nLoaded up a new campaign and I'm given a variety of choices of race and heroes reminenscent to Heroes of Might and Magic. Bits and pieces of lore that come up during load screens and selection moments made it feel immersive. Again, more cinematics follow and I am put into a real time battle right away with a voiced helper. My army consisted of a leader/hero and multiple unit types. It felt a little overwhelming at first with the rival army running at you, but do not worry since you're almost guaranteed to win the battle; just spend some time examining units and exploring the battlefield. The leader could provide buffs and spells and you are free to micromanage the multiple unit types in your army. The sound effects and voices set a great mood to the battles. It felt like a combination of Age of Empires and Romance of the Three Kingdoms. One thing that caught my attention was the spell menu, which, I didn't manage to figure out but it seems like your hero could utilize spells that could turn the tide of battles later on. There were previews of each spell and each one looked epic. I can't wait to try them out later. After battles you could also choose what to do with the captured enemy survivors and each choice provides a different bonus.\n\nAfter the battle, the game teaches about managing your cities, which felt a bit like Civilization. You could upgrade your buildings that will provide bonuses to your army.\n\nOverall, I'm pretty impressed with the level of detail, epic sounds and mix of various game mechanics and I'm only an hour into the game.\n\nI'll update this review after progressing further, had to rush this review out to balance out all the peeps who gave a negative just because the game took a while to start up.","May 24","true","2.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The factions are all fun and interesting while the lvl up for characters is great. Ive finally beat chaos and seen that the grand campaign can in fact be a long term investment because chaos does truely go away after a final defeat.\nHowever like always something feels off with the new release and like always its the blood and gore dlc missing. I say This because after having it for so long now in the last few games this feels weird seeing them fight it out with no blood: but i know its coming.\nAn issue noted by the community in past games still exists. An enemy faction with 1 city owning 2 full armies, yet when you take that city it doesnt provide you with enough income to build even half of a new army. Ill have 8 cities and be almost broke maintaining 3 or 4 armies but obviously the npc has some rediculous unfair advantage with money or its programmed to ignore money altogether.\nBattle speed. there is nothing worse than needing to move your troops to a weak spot in your line but your 3 units of 30 plus soldiers is taking what seems like an hour to kill the remaining 1 unit of 20 enemies theyre surrounding. Im not a fan of seeing the enemy scattered between my men some off alne and my guys just cant seem to land that killing blow....at this point i should be abl;e to just march and WALK over the enemy to kill them but somehow my guys cant finish the job. It takes a really long time for anyone to actually kill in this game. even a mortar blast seemingly hits like a pillow cannon many times. I dont want people dying so fast that i cant take tactical control of the battle but this is rediculous. No enemy should be outnumbered 4 to one and scattered around and hold out as long as they do.\nBut all of this aside its a really good total war that makes me want to play every faction because now for the first time they all play very differently. The graphics are pretty good and large armies dont crash my pc or lag out like rome 2. This is a game that should be owned by any rts, warhammer, or total war fan despite the handful of stupid issues it has which i hope get tweaked in patching","May 27","true","47.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Absolutely worth the price and worth the wait.\n\nGraphics and PerformanceThe game runs very well and looks absolutely stunning and beautiful; colors pop out and the contrast between different magical effects and bows and gunfire is all stunning to look at. Game performs like a beauty, but then again, my specs are a bit up there as far as monetary cost and tier on the market (check my YouTube for my PC specs and equipment).\n\nGameplayThe game plays quite refreshingly from other Total War games; not only is the fantasy setting quite interesting to dive into, but it just feels fresh because of the major differences between the factions and their unit rosters and economic mechanics on the campaign map. So far, I am impressed with how fresh the game feels.\n\nValue for the PriceAlthough I have only played a few hours of the game, I already feel like I've gotten more than my money's worth and I have a feeling there is a great longetivity in this game as far as the campaign and battles and such are concerned. I am going to enjoy playing this game.\n\nPlease check out my YouTube channel for Total War and grand strategy content, impressions and review videos, and much more:\n\nhttp://youtube.com/user/AdrianL1996","May 24","true","11.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The first and most obvious is performance; unless you have a rusty old toaster it should run just fine as opposed to say, Attila: Total Lag. Although far fewer, factions are diverse in their playstyles and goals. Each faction is far more than effectively the same roster units with a different paint job, with a bit of unique stuff tossed in. It isn't just represented by units or specific buffs, there are serious mechanical differences and on top of that the campaign has a good number of RPG elements which add plenty of welcome flavor.\n\nThe ruinous forces of Chaos and others can find allies, in the enemies of their enemies such as the undead or greenskins. From the start you get to pick from two or three starting heroes. Agents can now act as units, ones as mighty as any commander but capable of carrying out typical agent actions. Important heroic characters of all variety can carry powerful buffs, be equipped with various things you receive from winning a battle and given mounts. Units in general actually have weight, it doesn't look as though they're all busy choosing a dueling partner in the middle of a giant battle. For instance, large units don't get caught up like elephants would in previous Total Wars, they will merrily walk on through groups of units if you tell them to. Plus the UI in general is a masterpiece, allowing so much more customization—it cannot be understated how thoroughly an improvement this is.","May 24","true","98.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The AI on siege defence needs to be more pro-active and sally forth if they are getting battered. You can game them by taking out the towers, if you can stay out of the arcs with most of your units. Then move in the ranged units to plink at the walls while they mill about. As the vampire counts I didn't have any artillery and was forced to storm the walls. The few times I did this the AI was so so at the walls, but the towers were pretty powerful and took down a siege tower or two each time.\n\nThe AI in the field seemed okay. It used its ranged units well enough, flanked and charged with the mobile units, and generally handled the troops as well as could be expected for a computer that isn't a Cray, or other super computer. Kept the artillery well back, the Goblin doom divers are great! :)\n\nThe number of agents that come and make your life miserable is a bit high at this moment too. You have to make your own agents, and then hope they can take out the pests... but this isn't always possible when they are much higher in levels.\n\nSo far I have played a bit of the start of Empire, Dwarfs (dwarves?), and Vampire counts today. Each has their own feel and challenges. I have not progressed to get the highest level units yet, but each faction seems unique enough. Tomorrow I will tackle the Chaos and Greenskins for 50 or 60 turns or so. Then I plan on settling in and doing one full campaign on each faction.\n\nThe RPG aspect for the heros is pretty good, and I think it will add a lot of replay value as you explore different builds on the tech tree as well as the spell or melee trees. Many combinations to test and try.\n\nI am by no means a hardcore Total War player, but I am a fan of the series and have been since the first Shogun showed up. I see a few complaints that the game has been "dumbed down" or what have you. Perhaps it is simplified and streamlined a bit too much, but I wasn't much of a micro manager fan anyway so it feels pretty good to me.","May 24","true","39.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Absolutely worth the price and worth the wait.\n\nGraphics and PerformanceThe game runs very well and looks absolutely stunning and beautiful; colors pop out and the contrast between different magical effects and bows and gunfire is all stunning to look at. Game performs like a beauty, but then again, my specs are a bit up there as far as monetary cost and tier on the market (check my YouTube for my PC specs and equipment).\n\nGameplayThe game plays quite refreshingly from other Total War games; not only is the fantasy setting quite interesting to dive into, but it just feels fresh because of the major differences between the factions and their unit rosters and economic mechanics on the campaign map. So far, I am impressed with how fresh the game feels.\n\nValue for the PriceAlthough I have only played a few hours of the game, I already feel like I've gotten more than my money's worth and I have a feeling there is a great longetivity in this game as far as the campaign and battles and such are concerned. I am going to enjoy playing this game.\n\nPlease check out my YouTube channel for Total War and grand strategy content, impressions and review videos, and much more:\n\nhttp://youtube.com/user/AdrianL1996","May 24","true","11.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Fairly impressed so far.\n\n-Seige battles are rather linear, while i like the improvements to making seiges better with the AI and less about just spamming choke points like the prior games they end too quickly and attackers have a rather limited set of options to actually assualt most setlements.\n-More starting locations on the campaign map would be an improvement, there is already a mod to allow this but being allowed to choose which tribe/clan/count to start the campaign as would be an improvement to allowing you to feel as if you are crafting your own nation.\n\n\nOverall i'm impressed so far, almost bug free launch and an impressive display in both battle and the campaign so far its looking like this will be an impressive entry in the series.\n\n","May 24","true","29.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The first and most obvious is performance; unless you have a rusty old toaster it should run just fine as opposed to say, Attila: Total Lag. Although far fewer, factions are diverse in their playstyles and goals. Each faction is far more than effectively the same roster units with a different paint job, with a bit of unique stuff tossed in. It isn't just represented by units or specific buffs, there are serious mechanical differences and on top of that the campaign has a good number of RPG elements which add plenty of welcome flavor.\n\nThe ruinous forces of Chaos and others can find allies, in the enemies of their enemies such as the undead or greenskins. From the start you get to pick from two or three starting heroes. Agents can now act as units, ones as mighty as any commander but capable of carrying out typical agent actions. Important heroic characters of all variety can carry powerful buffs, be equipped with various things you receive from winning a battle and given mounts. Units in general actually have weight, it doesn't look as though they're all busy choosing a dueling partner in the middle of a giant battle. For instance, large units don't get caught up like elephants would in previous Total Wars, they will merrily walk on through groups of units if you tell them to. Plus the UI in general is a masterpiece, allowing so much more customization—it cannot be understated how thoroughly an improvement this is.","May 24","true","98.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Total War: Warhammer is quite unlike any other Total War game. Flying units, Spells, and monsters make the game unique. However, the cost is a reduction of strategy on the campaign map.

This is a series I have cared a great deal about, and part of that comes from the love-hate relationship with the imperfections of the series. Each game has its failings: Medevial 1 was just rough; Medevial 2 had poor agents and quests and bad A.I. for sieges; Empire ran like crap at launch; Napoleon was too small in scope; Shogun 2 had the awful unit matching system that made it run poorly. Despite this I loved each one in their own way and while Medevial 2 remained my favorite I dreamed for the day that Total War made the game I always had in my head.\n\nThey finally did it. It took them a decade and 8 games but they did it.\n\nI would argue that Total Warhammer is the culimation of the concept that is the Total War game design. It simplifies the extraneous layers added over time to appease the realism audience while retaining the primary challenge of those layers through faction-specific requirements. It captures the feel of the factions through systems which, as a developer, I know is incredibly hard.  It also runs really well (on my machine) which means they captured the beautiful art style in a way that smartly works with their engine.\n\nI've owned this game for two days and I'm coming up on 20 hours. In my life this is the type of game-devotion I haven't had since I had tons of free time in High School. Teen me is giddy.\n\nI am sure as I continue on I will find things I don't like about the game, but considering I've played so much and nothing stands out is already a miracle for a Total War game.\n\nIf you're into Total War, Warhammer Fantasy, or just want a damn good RTS I highly suggest this game.","May 26","true","74.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I find myself playing in slow-mo a lot so that I can zoom in and watch the animations...and still have time to manage all the units.\n2) Game map is good, with lots of different terrains and textures.  Every battle area feels somewhat unique, requiring different tactics.\n3) Coop Multi-player Combat is fun, but unfortunately it doesn't do enough to cancel out the Coop Multi-player con listed below.\n\nCons:\n1) Coop Multi-player non-combat gameplay is soooo slowwwwwww. The gameplay is true turn-based...meaning you have to wait on the person to finish that is in front of you before you can go.  Of course this allows for multiple attack strategies, but it drags the game out so long that is almost unfinishable without some extreme hours played into it.\n2) Heroes might be a bit over-powered...There is a level 30 greenskin running around my provinces assassinating everyone, and I can't do anything to kill him.\n\nOverall: Buy it!  Play it! ... just one more turn, and then 10 hours later....just one more turn.","May 31","true","57.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

I have to say that the game runs great so far (caveat of only playing a few hours so far) and it really gets you into the warhammer universe.  I will post more as I get farther along, but as of right now I recommend this game.\n\nEDIT:\nAfter playing through a full campaign on Normal with the Dwarves, I can say I am really digging this game, especially compared to the previous outings, again my opinion.\n\nPROS:\n-Game runs great, I have a relatively new gaming laptop, and I have the settings maxed out.  I had the same settings for Attila as well as Rome II, and this game smokes it in terms of performance.  Having 4 armies on screen duking it out, Dwarves vs Orks is something to behold.\n\n-I like what they did with the sieges.  It was a bit confusing at first as I didn't read all the previews for this game, so not seeing city battles was a surprise but I think this works well.\n\n-Lore.  I used to play the old warhammer RTS games back in the day, and this brings it right back but even more.  If you are a fan of this universe or just fantasy in general I think you'll be hard pressed to find a better Fantasy big battle RTS game.\n\n-Races.  I will caveat that I have only played the campaign for the dwarves, but just the differences between all the races is refreshing.  It really makes you rethink strategy and how to make your race work for you.\n\n-Battles.  Some say the tactical battles are dumbed down, in terms of setting formations etc. but I think with the addition of magic and the wide variety of units it just makes it that much more complex and it just means you might spend a bit more time setting up your deployment.\n\nCONS:\n-Diplomacy.  Right now in its current form it is pretty underutilized.  I understand that Dwarves and Orks won't ever ally but at least when working with the humans or other dwarf factions there could be a bit more to it.  I found that for almost the first 100 turns I didn't even bother with the diplomacy tab.  The other gripe, and it needs to be fixed as it is a pretty big bug in my opinion is the go to war / declare peace with monetary offerings.  Numerous times other dwarf factions would go to war with the undead only for the undead to offer a peace treaty with X gold payment.  Why of course I will take your money!  Only to follow 2 turns later by the dwarfs offering money for me to go back to war with the undead.  2 payments to remain as the status quo.\n\n-Difficulty/Campaign map.  Granted I only played on normal, but I found the layout of the world map led me to only have to really deal with orcs in the south while everyone else fought for life up north, especially when Chaos came a'knockin'.  I think there could be some work there, or please speak up if maybe I just need to up the difficulty level.\n\n-Graphic glitches.  I did say the game ran like silk, but during loading screens and sometimes on the campaign map the screen would blank for a split second then return.  I enabled Vsync (I have a gsync monitor so I didn't think I needed to do this) and that seemed to remove the problem.\n\n-Heroes.  I have found that I just preferred them to be in my army instead of running around doing their hero thing.  It didn't affect me in the least, so there might be some updating needing to be done with that as well.\n\n-Capturing settlements.  I like the idea that dwarves can only take orc settlements and vice versa, and same goes for humans and vampires.  However, it does make it a royal pain in the ♥♥♥ when heading up north to fight, and never having a base to replenish the troops besides encamping.  I think this is just something that I have to get used to.\n\n\nOVERALL:\n\nI think the game is great, the best running for sure compared to the other recent releases from CA.  This is different from Attila and Rome, but for me that works and I actually prefer it.\n\nI highly recommend this game for the lore, fantasy and the beautiful battles.  With the future DLC options and patches I'm sure, this game will only get better.\n\n9/10\n\n-Ezekiel","May 24","true","40.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Better than Rome Total War I  and not as building heavy as  the other previous titles  which is a plus and a minus in the same time .\nThe combat is  nice and enjoyable [a little frustrating against skirmishers, but you need to adapt against them. (the computer does a better job at controlling this type of units) ]\n\nThe magic is kinda weak , but it is a good adition.\n\nThe annoying part is the heroes  especially since somehow they manage to have a lot , early on and they level so fast and they always go on offensive and they use them often  and I have no clue where they have the money to spend.  Loosing your legendary generals (twice in a row , barely resurected him )and heroes  even when you have defensive ones deployed to protect is quite annoying.\n\nYou also need to adapt to the no conquer of provinces which is  not funny.  Big dwarf caves , no light why  can\'t I settle with the vampire lords there ?\n\nThe attrition is also very harsh so planning needs to be done.\n\nOverall 9/ 10\n\n\nThank you very much for your patience in reading.\n","June 1","true","56.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The Warhammer world rests beutifully rendered in glorious detail. The attention to the lore, back ground stories, unit detail and so on is amazing with the campaigns including some of the storied moments from the history of the Warhammer world and access to some of the unique characters only being granted when certain game world events take place.\nBattles themselves are what you would expect from the Total War franchise: detailed; full of animation and action; tactical; hinged on player skill and strategy.\nAlthough the units dont have the different abilities of the previous Total War games this is mostly because they don\'t have additional skills in the Warhammer world so wedges, squares, flaming arrows etc are not present in the game. You also cant upgrade the units in the same way, they can gain experience and by levelling up the general or the tech tree (depending on your race) you can improve their weapon and armour quality. Units with different weapons e.g. chaos warriors or warriors with great swords are treated as seperate entities and are recruited etc. in their own ways.\nThe most impressive part of the game is how differently each of the races plays in the game. Not just on the battlefield either, the units are genuinely different and fun in their own ways but the strategic games are also vastly different for each of the various races. Vampire Counts and Chaos have their own unique ways of recruiting, Orcs can summon a WAAGGHHH!, dwarves and humans rely on trade and infrastructure to keep going and diplomacy tops the whole thing off with a valid and effective system.\nOn top of this there is multiplayer, quick battles and battles from the history of the Warhammer world allowing you to re-enact some of the famous confrontations from the lore.\nWithout a doubt one of my favourite games of the year, go get it now!","June 1","true","49.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Warhammer meets Total War, how ♥♥♥♥ing nerdy and beautiful is that?! Anyway the idea of it is very cool.\nAlso the campaign is a lot more friendly for new players I find and is easier to grasp, but still has many functions, if I was to recommend any Total War game to someone completely new to the franchise it would have to be Total War: Warhammer based on the campaign alone.\nIt looks great and handles a lot better than previous Total War titles! The battles aswell mixed with the sick units and ghastly beasts just make it ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic! For example you could watch as a unit of Empire knights charge into some unexpecting Dwarfs and send them flying off their feet into the air metres away, it gives a very satisfying feeling, its euphoric.\nThe diversity between playable factions make this game even better.\nI conclude that this game is definitely worth a buy. I can only see it improving with future updates and faction releases, unit packs and such (I guess there are more factions, I am not really acquainted with Warhammer lore so I really don't know) as cool as this would be, lets face it, it would more than likely be DLC!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SeizeTheMeans/recommended/364360/","SeizeTheMeans","☭GareBear☭","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SeizeTheMeans/","247 products in account","I absolutely recommend this game. TW:W is the most bug-free TW game-launch that comes to memory (keep in mind I saw my first launch with E:TW). It runs at a silky-smooth 60fps on the Ultra preset, even in large battles. However, like any TW game, it starts to slow down (30fps)when you zoom in really close to watch the cool action.\n\nKeep in mind, my rig has an i7-3770k, a GTX 980Ti, 16GB of RAM, and the game is installed on an SSD, far beyond the recommended 60fps+ spec. The minimum spec, however, is a Core2Duo and a GTS450 for 15-20fps on low.\n\nI'll start with the basics:\n\nThis game has all the familiarity of a Total War game in the awesome setting of the Warhammer universe. You'll soon be forgetting that there are only 6 playable factions because they are so unique, and require a different playstyle depending on your opponent. Sure, Rome 2 had 10-15 playable factions, but were the 5-6 Gaulic tribes really that different? Every faction is extremely unique, except Bretonia. I think Bretonia is just there as a placeholder?\n\nThe battles are more satisying than ever before. It's like the Third Age mod taken to the extreme. Watching Empire cavalry smash thru zombie ranks or watching the armoured giants fight dwarfen infantry is the most satisfying battle-experience I've ever had in any TW game, ever.\n\nNo experience with the campaign yet :( Will edit when I do.\n\nMultiplayer is good right now, everyone is learning their comfort zone and is new, even vets to the series.\n\nIn short, this is worth the $60 price tag.","May 24","true","15.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lbthegreat/recommended/364360/","lbthegreat","lbthegreat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lbthegreat/","144 products in account","I'm a fairly jaded Total War fan. I love the series a lot, but I've been fairly disappointed with everything since Medieval II. Yes, even Shogun 2 which everyone seems to be talking about as the last great game in the franchise. I thought it was really uninteresting to play. I'm also a big Warhammer fan, who has been largely underwhelmed with modern video game adaptations such as they are. I nearly didn't pre-order Total Warhammer.\n\n\nI'm glad I did, it is in my opinion the (equal) best Total War game to date, matching the originals inventiveness and experimental nature. I love it.\n\nMy PC is not good. I have a good graphics card but my CPU is five years old and is rubbish. I can still play Total Warhammer on the recommended settings with a better framerate than I've had in a TW game in five years. I've had no technical issues whtsoever, no crashes or freezes or slowdowns or anything.\n\nThe graphics are fantastic. The Warhammer World has never looked so good, and it looks good even with the settings set fairly low. I do have some criticisms of some design elements, combat animations are a bit less interesting than previous games but honestly I'd rather that get patched in later and have the dev team focus on delivering a stable game first which is what seems to have happened.\n\nGameplay is excellent. Each race (I've only played Vampire Counts, Empire and Dwarfs so far, no Orcs or Chaoss) has a distinct play style that actually works, and each unit type seems to have a value when you use it properly. I tended to end up with cookie cutter armies in most previous installments but I find myself building widely variant armies in this installment, and having success with them.\nThe campaign map and city building elements are familiar with no major innovations I think but its well executed and easy to use.\nAI seems much improved. Skealing and Varg races in particular were downright cunning, sending armies right down the coast to raid my souther cities while harassing me in the north. Unlike in previous games there was actually a patchwork of AI powers that formed a fairly stable bloc of nations to the south rather than being dominated by one race (though the very south ended up being controlled by teh dwarfs after they successfully destroyed all the orc tribes). Diplomacy is MUCH better, I actually started getting offers of peace and trade from AI at sensible times intead of waiting until I was besieging their final city to sue for peace. Sometimes a war would end as soon as it would begin because I'd come to an allies aid and the aggressor would throw money at me.\nBattle AI seems improved too, with all the races using tactics suited to their unit roster. Battles have been challenging without being unbalanced for the difficulty level.\n\nI don't feel only having four or five playable factions at the start is a negative, not when each plays so differently. Having said that I am looking forward to getting more factions to play, especially Elves. Dark and Wood Elves would offer possibility for some really novel ways of shaking up the faction dynamic. Wood Elves expanding into forest rather than settlements, Dark Elves operating from Black Arks along the coast rather than traditional settlements and so forth. Maybe they won't go down that path but its fun to speculate.\n\nI do have a few minor general criticisms:\n-The Skaeling and Varg seem to be far too powerful early on. I've yet to see Kislev hold onto more than one settlement by turn 50, they get slaughtered by the Norsca tribes and then WoC come and finish them off. Having that happen sometimes is fine, having Kisleb be destroyed every time not so much. They just serve as a speedbump for Chaos.\n\n-Where are the women? Seriously. Kislev is ruled by a woman and they couldn't even muster the resources to put her in game? Same for the Elector Countess of Nuln, I saw several of the other Elector Counts like Marius Leitdorf but the woman gets left out? The Empire has never been as sexist as the history on which it is based, its had empresses before and women electors and city rulers are not unusual. There are even female knights in the novels, and female wizards have been present in the lore since forever as well, all absent from the game.\nIt gets even worse with Vampire Counts, where they have portraits and in game models for female vampires but limit them only to heroes when WFB has had female vampire lords for DECADES. I'm not talking Neferata either but von Carsteins and others. The Lahmians have a whole shadow empire going on AND have led forces into battle in some of the novels but again, completely absent from the game. I'm a guy, this isn't some political issue, this is accuracy to the source material being ignored, its frustrating. If I'm negotiating with Kislev I want to see the damned Queen of Kislev ok, not just hear about her from an NPC.\nDwarven queens leading armies into battle is canon too, just saying. You can't cite historical accuracy this time CA, you're messing up the source material out of laziness. I swear if Alarielle isn't a legendary lord for High Elves I will be furious.\n\n-A bit more variety in town design on the campaign map would be nice. Like I said these are not huge issues, but Altdorf looks basically the same as Middenheim which looks the same as Talabheim etc. Or if there are differences they are so minor I missed them.\n\nAnyway, minor complaints aside this is an AMAZING game, 9/10, best Total War game since the original.","May 26","true","69.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

Most of peoples  issues stem from the game not starting or other bugs. Normally I would not review day 1, but with my current setup, i7 4790k 4.0 ghz, 980ti, 32gb ram and running the game off a SSD I have absolultely no issues or game crashing bugs. I hope that other reviewers will update their review when they've logged more hours into the game (as will I). If you have a similar build or high end build you probably will be fine. I'd also encourage you to update your graphics drivers to the most recent available. At least thats what I did and have no performance issues. In fact the game feels like it runs smoother than other total wars.\n\nIn my hour of gameplay I've summized that this is going to be a great series of games based in the warhammer world. Combat is more or less the same as it's always been with some tweaks to charges and more fluidity in unit v unit combat. There are no combat animations or locked 1v1's which adds to the fluidity of combat and was much needed in Total War. Battles are paced fairly fast.. and it takes some getting used to the rock paper scissors magic big ♥♥♥♥ing beast style of gameplay but it's a breath of fresh air in the Total War series and an interesting departure from historical titles (for the time being).\n\nI'd recommend those having issues to go to the official total war forums, reddit, or TWC!\n\nIn the mean time I'll continue to play and post up a review in a week or so! Great game so far!","May 24","true","57.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

But still figuring this game out.\n\nI was hoping for a game that would be reminicent of one of my all-time favorites - Warhammer: Dark Omen. Anyone who ever had the privilege of playing that wonderful game would know the beauty of which I speak. This game (Total War: Warhammer) certainly has a lot of the aspects that that masterpiece contained (most importantly, the Warhammer world), but to be honest, there is a sort of "simplicity" that is missing.\n\nThe game is relatively complex in comparison to the simple, intuitive controls that Dark Omen had. Yes, this is a Total War game after all, but I was really hoping for something that was a bit more "pick up and play". Here, there are so many things to read and take notice of, and it's not just a case of "here are your dudes, upgrade them if you want, replace some dead ones, and go straight to battle". Here, you have things like economy, upkeep, multiple fronts to protect, some random dude telling you stuff all the time etc.\n\nAnyway, don't get me wrong - the actual combat element of the game is amazing and really all I was hoping for (except for the addition of that "To the death!" button that Dark Omen had where you could pump up your units' strength manually by clicking a button endlessly (that was possibly the most awesome addition ever).\n\nLet's see how it goes, but for now, I'd give it a decent 7/10.","May 24","true","2.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

After that i did something different than what i watched on youtube, or on big streams ..i didn't raze them, i didn't subjugate them i just pillaged and moved on to the south...\nTo my surprize at around turn 90-100 as i was hunting down the empire scum i was searching for their last cities on the diplomacy when i saw that all the northern tribes that i spared had united and were curently the number 1 power faction in the entire campaign ... That was just soo cool.\nAnother powerfull moment occured when i got a "special" cinematic, (NO SPOILERS DON"T WORRY) and suddently i was beeing hunted all over the map by a particular someone. I kept using the human cities and armies as shields to buy time and muster enough men to destroy my enemy. Suddently the empire scum became the reason i didn't loose the campaign at around turn 125-130. I was amazed.\nThose were my impresions, the game is optimized, runs really good, exacly as Rome 2 emperor edition would run on my PC (didn't play rome 2 at launch so i can't jugde), with an GTX 970 and an i7 4770k it defaulted on ultra settings, never had a problem.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lbthegreat/recommended/364360/","lbthegreat","lbthegreat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lbthegreat/","144 products in account","I'm a fairly jaded Total War fan. I love the series a lot, but I've been fairly disappointed with everything since Medieval II. Yes, even Shogun 2 which everyone seems to be talking about as the last great game in the franchise. I thought it was really uninteresting to play. I'm also a big Warhammer fan, who has been largely underwhelmed with modern video game adaptations such as they are. I nearly didn't pre-order Total Warhammer.\n\n\nI'm glad I did, it is in my opinion the (equal) best Total War game to date, matching the originals inventiveness and experimental nature. I love it.\n\nMy PC is not good. I have a good graphics card but my CPU is five years old and is rubbish. I can still play Total Warhammer on the recommended settings with a better framerate than I've had in a TW game in five years. I've had no technical issues whtsoever, no crashes or freezes or slowdowns or anything.\n\nThe graphics are fantastic. The Warhammer World has never looked so good, and it looks good even with the settings set fairly low. I do have some criticisms of some design elements, combat animations are a bit less interesting than previous games but honestly I'd rather that get patched in later and have the dev team focus on delivering a stable game first which is what seems to have happened.\n\nGameplay is excellent. Each race (I've only played Vampire Counts, Empire and Dwarfs so far, no Orcs or Chaoss) has a distinct play style that actually works, and each unit type seems to have a value when you use it properly. I tended to end up with cookie cutter armies in most previous installments but I find myself building widely variant armies in this installment, and having success with them.\nThe campaign map and city building elements are familiar with no major innovations I think but its well executed and easy to use.\nAI seems much improved. Skealing and Varg races in particular were downright cunning, sending armies right down the coast to raid my souther cities while harassing me in the north. Unlike in previous games there was actually a patchwork of AI powers that formed a fairly stable bloc of nations to the south rather than being dominated by one race (though the very south ended up being controlled by teh dwarfs after they successfully destroyed all the orc tribes). Diplomacy is MUCH better, I actually started getting offers of peace and trade from AI at sensible times intead of waiting until I was besieging their final city to sue for peace. Sometimes a war would end as soon as it would begin because I'd come to an allies aid and the aggressor would throw money at me.\nBattle AI seems improved too, with all the races using tactics suited to their unit roster. Battles have been challenging without being unbalanced for the difficulty level.\n\nI don't feel only having four or five playable factions at the start is a negative, not when each plays so differently. Having said that I am looking forward to getting more factions to play, especially Elves. Dark and Wood Elves would offer possibility for some really novel ways of shaking up the faction dynamic. Wood Elves expanding into forest rather than settlements, Dark Elves operating from Black Arks along the coast rather than traditional settlements and so forth. Maybe they won't go down that path but its fun to speculate.\n\nI do have a few minor general criticisms:\n-The Skaeling and Varg seem to be far too powerful early on. I've yet to see Kislev hold onto more than one settlement by turn 50, they get slaughtered by the Norsca tribes and then WoC come and finish them off. Having that happen sometimes is fine, having Kisleb be destroyed every time not so much. They just serve as a speedbump for Chaos.\n\n-Where are the women? Seriously. Kislev is ruled by a woman and they couldn't even muster the resources to put her in game? Same for the Elector Countess of Nuln, I saw several of the other Elector Counts like Marius Leitdorf but the woman gets left out? The Empire has never been as sexist as the history on which it is based, its had empresses before and women electors and city rulers are not unusual. There are even female knights in the novels, and female wizards have been present in the lore since forever as well, all absent from the game.\nIt gets even worse with Vampire Counts, where they have portraits and in game models for female vampires but limit them only to heroes when WFB has had female vampire lords for DECADES. I'm not talking Neferata either but von Carsteins and others. The Lahmians have a whole shadow empire going on AND have led forces into battle in some of the novels but again, completely absent from the game. I'm a guy, this isn't some political issue, this is accuracy to the source material being ignored, its frustrating. If I'm negotiating with Kislev I want to see the damned Queen of Kislev ok, not just hear about her from an NPC.\nDwarven queens leading armies into battle is canon too, just saying. You can't cite historical accuracy this time CA, you're messing up the source material out of laziness. I swear if Alarielle isn't a legendary lord for High Elves I will be furious.\n\n-A bit more variety in town design on the campaign map would be nice. Like I said these are not huge issues, but Altdorf looks basically the same as Middenheim which looks the same as Talabheim etc. Or if there are differences they are so minor I missed them.\n\nAnyway, minor complaints aside this is an AMAZING game, 9/10, best Total War game since the original.","May 26","true","69.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

(-8 at Legendary. -4 at Very hard.) the rest of the difficulty seems the same.\n\nI really like the game. The combat, setting and races are all super fun but it evolves into a 'Total War.. AGAINST CHAOS!' the rest of the factions are bothersome. Not dangerous. Only chaos makes you really fight for your stuff...\nAnd if you are playing as the greenskins or Dwarves you got next to unlimited ammount of time to tech & set up your armies before your 'buffer' of other AI's die to the hands of Chaos.\nKnowing that it get's kinda meh.\n\nI really wish there was a proper fight between the races. Not a landgrab to build up your economy to face the threat of the north. WINTER IS COMMING... -_-\n\nThe AI is smarter than in previous total war games BUT... It acts even more like an AI. It knows EXACTLY how far it can go and WHERE it can go on the campaignmap to dodge your armies and prevent you from catching them.\nAnd somehow they can ALWAYS walk further than you. (i once had something crazy like 48% increased campaignmap speed.) and yet it was not enough.\n\nThe AI also avoids other potential AI threats and gets tunnelvision for your own- Player settlements.\n\nAs for hte launch and bugs. There are some slight performanceissues but i'm thinking it's more my PC than the game. I've had a few crashes however but concidering the time i've put in.

TW:W is the most bug-free TW game-launch that comes to memory (keep in mind I saw my first launch with E:TW). It runs at a silky-smooth 60fps on the Ultra preset, even in large battles. However, like any TW game, it starts to slow down (30fps)when you zoom in really close to watch the cool action.\n\nKeep in mind, my rig has an i7-3770k, a GTX 980Ti, 16GB of RAM, and the game is installed on an SSD, far beyond the recommended 60fps+ spec. The minimum spec, however, is a Core2Duo and a GTS450 for 15-20fps on low.\n\nI'll start with the basics:\n\nThis game has all the familiarity of a Total War game in the awesome setting of the Warhammer universe. You'll soon be forgetting that there are only 6 playable factions because they are so unique, and require a different playstyle depending on your opponent. Sure, Rome 2 had 10-15 playable factions, but were the 5-6 Gaulic tribes really that different? Every faction is extremely unique, except Bretonia. I think Bretonia is just there as a placeholder?\n\nThe battles are more satisying than ever before. It's like the Third Age mod taken to the extreme. Watching Empire cavalry smash thru zombie ranks or watching the armoured giants fight dwarfen infantry is the most satisfying battle-experience I've ever had in any TW game, ever.\n\nNo experience with the campaign yet :( Will edit when I do.\n\nMultiplayer is good right now, everyone is learning their comfort zone and is new, even vets to the series.\n\nIn short, this is worth the $60 price tag.","May 24","true","15.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SeizeTheMeans/recommended/364360/","SeizeTheMeans","☭GareBear☭","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SeizeTheMeans/","247 products in account","I absolutely recommend this game. TW:W is the most bug-free TW game-launch that comes to memory (keep in mind I saw my first launch with E:TW). It runs at a silky-smooth 60fps on the Ultra preset, even in large battles. However, like any TW game, it starts to slow down (30fps)when you zoom in really close to watch the cool action.\n\nKeep in mind, my rig has an i7-3770k, a GTX 980Ti, 16GB of RAM, and the game is installed on an SSD, far beyond the recommended 60fps+ spec. The minimum spec, however, is a Core2Duo and a GTS450 for 15-20fps on low.\n\nI'll start with the basics:\n\nThis game has all the familiarity of a Total War game in the awesome setting of the Warhammer universe. You'll soon be forgetting that there are only 6 playable factions because they are so unique, and require a different playstyle depending on your opponent. Sure, Rome 2 had 10-15 playable factions, but were the 5-6 Gaulic tribes really that different? Every faction is extremely unique, except Bretonia. I think Bretonia is just there as a placeholder?\n\nThe battles are more satisying than ever before. It's like the Third Age mod taken to the extreme. Watching Empire cavalry smash thru zombie ranks or watching the armoured giants fight dwarfen infantry is the most satisfying battle-experience I've ever had in any TW game, ever.\n\nNo experience with the campaign yet :( Will edit when I do.\n\nMultiplayer is good right now, everyone is learning their comfort zone and is new, even vets to the series.\n\nIn short, this is worth the $60 price tag.","May 24","true","15.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

(-8 at Legendary. -4 at Very hard.) the rest of the difficulty seems the same.\n\nI really like the game. The combat, setting and races are all super fun but it evolves into a 'Total War.. AGAINST CHAOS!' the rest of the factions are bothersome. Not dangerous. Only chaos makes you really fight for your stuff...\nAnd if you are playing as the greenskins or Dwarves you got next to unlimited ammount of time to tech & set up your armies before your 'buffer' of other AI's die to the hands of Chaos.\nKnowing that it get's kinda meh.\n\nI really wish there was a proper fight between the races. Not a landgrab to build up your economy to face the threat of the north. WINTER IS COMMING... -_-\n\nThe AI is smarter than in previous total war games BUT... It acts even more like an AI. It knows EXACTLY how far it can go and WHERE it can go on the campaignmap to dodge your armies and prevent you from catching them.\nAnd somehow they can ALWAYS walk further than you. (i once had something crazy like 48% increased campaignmap speed.) and yet it was not enough.\n\nThe AI also avoids other potential AI threats and gets tunnelvision for your own- Player settlements.\n\nAs for hte launch and bugs. There are some slight performanceissues but i'm thinking it's more my PC than the game. I've had a few crashes however but concidering the time i've put in.

Some of them are infuriating enough to make me quit and come back later. That doesn't matter though because everything else makes me care enough to keep trying and I am having fun. This time Total War has got right what many of it's predecessors have been getting wrong and has put fun back into the formula, not as something you have to look hard to find but as something that comes screaming angrily at you from over the hill just as long as you resist the temptation to agree to choose the tutorial and have the foresight to set the advisor to interupt minimally.\n\nCurrently, the battles are far too fast-paced and turn the game into a twitch-focused micro mini-game like an arcade or action-RTS. This is something that has happened in all recent Total War games since at least Shogun 2 but has been partially fixed in patches. Some players like it and CA clearly do like it because they keep pushing in this direction, giving in only when players push back, but it's not what I feel Total War is supposed to be. CA's own people were unable to properly show-off the battles in the run-up to release because things were happening too fast, so they would zoom in to show the fighting but then the AI would decide to do something off-camera so they had to quickly deal with it and such. It helps to know certain things about unit control which allow you to send units in formation to fight without intensive micro-management, which I had to learn on the forums because the useless tutorial and advisor don't tell you.\n\nThere are bugs, but apart from the obvious graphical ones such as lighting, shadows and a dodgy flicker when V-sync is turned on, they are hard to spot but impact the game badly. One such bug doing my head in is that the AI factions often go to war with you on their turn but don't always declare it- the diplomacy screen doesn't pop up to let you know and the even log doesn't show you are now at war with someone. Often the first indication you'll get is when you notice a border has turned red against you. Until this and the battle pacing is fixed, I can't give this the undiluted praise it came so close to getting from me. This should not however put you off because there's more to this game than what it currently is and it is off to a good start, living up to the initial promise and it will get better still.","May 27","true","78.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

Shogun 2 was Creative Assembly at its best, a product that was so sharp and well polished that you could hardly point to any objective faults, even if you could dislike a couple of design decisions. But it is a masterpiece, I have no doubts about that. Rome 2 and Attila, in comparison, have been clunky, with many questionable design decisions and objective faults that we all know about, from performance issues to a laughable AI, to the very nature of copy/paste that was part of the "variety" contained in Attila's factions.\n\nHowever, I am very happy to say that in Total War: Warhammer many changes have been made, and this truly feels like a return to form for CA. We have fewer factions available for the campaign than in any previous Total War, yes, but they never felt so different from each other as in this case. Each race is truly unique in terms of units and gameplay strategy, providing a fresh experience with every playthrough. They feel well balanced and polished, and each offers a unique angle to it that is both interesting and exciting. You get a feeling of possibility once again, of trying different tactics in order to achieve your goals, and that's what Total War should be all about.\n\nThe addition of flying units and magic also provide a whole new array of strategies at your disposal, and they add an element of surprise to each battle. Many units have no abilities of their own, unlike in previous Total Wars where some would have things like 'Berserk', 'Flaming Arrows', etc., as this micromanagement changed to the hands of your Lords and Heroes. These now have a use in battle other than their use in the campaign map, which is a welcome addition.\n\nThe soundtrack fits great, the graphics are top notch (and require a powerful machine to full enjoy them), and the multiplayer experience is simple but *works*.\n\nThere are things that I'm not too sure about, of course, although I can understand some of these decisions to fit with the lore of the Warhammer franchise. Regional occupation would be at the top of these concerns. I thought it would be worse, and fortunately there are mods which allow you to overcome this barrier.\n\nAll in all, this is the best Total War since Shogun 2, and I would certainly rank it at the very top with Medieval 2 and Shogun 2. This is Total War more exciting than it has ever been, and the Warhammer franchise has given it a touch of freshness that the series so desperately needed.\n\nTL;DR: Best Total War since Shogun 2. Unique races provide dozens of hours of varied gameplay, and magic is exciting. Requires a strong computer to enjoy the beauty of its graphics at its fullest.","May 31","true","133.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

If I am a human and I want to make a trade deal with another human it should be a done deal if your relationship with that human faction is neutral or above, because we both only benefit from the deal. There are a lot of other little things that overall make it a small problem, but one that is consistent and annoying.\n3. The heroes need rebalancing of some sort, because right now, they are very obnoxious, particularly the ones that kill your lords or block your armies movement. I personally disabled their ability to assassinate through a mod because I seriously could not level a lord past 2 or 3 in one of my campaigns because they were just that obnoxious.\n\nOther than those 3 complaints I think the game is awsome.

Just completed a Quest battle.\n\nFor what I've seen, the game works fine and looks very optimized. I have an i7 3770, 12GB and a GTX980 and I got 60FPS (about 50FPS when zooming-in in a batlle) with graphics on Ultra. The only minor issue I had is that when I first started the game I had to wait about a minute at a black screen. I guess that's where impatient people closed the game to write a negative review. I didn't test MP (don't care about it) but I wouldn't be surprised if for now it's collapsed.","May 24","true","3.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The units also are really good to look at beacuse they're really in detail! The Game also contains stunning Graphics & Music which with any game is really important. Another feature of the game is that it has brilliant mechanics from old Total War Games and new mechanics such as the in-depth Magic System. They have also used new mechanics from newer Total War's such as ROME 2 or ATTILA which makes the game way more fun but still keeping them old mechanics which the community loved. My favourite new addiiton to this game is the fact you can draw unit direction arrows using SHIFT + Right Click which determine the way the units can move around the map VERY accurately which is a fantastic idea and really changes how players can command their armies. I would also say there are no glitches which is quite something for a Total War game this early on. To repeat the Words of IGN: "This is what Total War is made for" and they are not wrong. I highly recommend this game but knowing CA they're going to release 100's of DLC's that cost big dollar but this is totally up to you to buy.\n\nOverall a fantastic game and a great release, lots of stunning aspects.

How were they going to incorportate this fantasy world, with all its beasts and magic? I thought it wouldn't be possible. I was so wrong!\n\nThis game is a true delight to play! The fantasy world of Warhammer has flawlessly been incorporated into the game. A great deal of lore has been researched and it is clearly seen from the moment you launch yourself into a battle or campaign. Now I started off in standard style as the Empire. My first battles against the scessionists were bloody indeed, the detail in each unit and map is fantastic. The AI are uncannily cunning at times, performing smooth flanking attakcs and effective use of terrain to their advantage. The shock of fighting other species such as Orcs, threw me into a new playstyle, as their brutal direct charges straight through my front lines of spears and secondary rows of swords did little to blunt their bloodthirsty advance. Suffice to say 2000 of the Emperors finest were lost that day.\n\nNow sufficently experienced in fighting Orcs and now Dwarves as my Empire has rapidly expanded swalloing up great sections of the land of men. From the Forests of Adren, Wissenland, Nordland, Tabalenacland and Western Sylvania. The races of men feel the corruption of chaos spreading and wreathing down from the North. Dark powers of the Vampires infect my Western borders. The game has brought about a complete conversion in my thoughts toward the game. Easily one of the best Total Wars in recent years! Smooth gameplay, intense combat, brilliant magical spells which used correctly can greatly aid the course of a battle! At the end of the day, even with these great spells and creatures like trolls, Imperial Peagasus' and Chaos Dragons, the game remains a Total War adventure, grand armies and hordes make up for differences in magic knowledge and use. The building browser remains similar to Romes, nothing to complain of, the technology tree finely balanced, there is enough to keep you watching your scholars for new tech. Diplomacy doesnt seem to have many changes, I have seen people declare the AI to be ignorant in diplomacy, I have had little in the way of annoying diplomacy in 80 turns. People have said that trade is also useuless? Not so? I make 5000 gold in trade? The game runs smoothly even on Ultra I get a wonderful 60-80fps. Then of course that depends upon your PC setup. The game has only crashed on me once, no doubt due to a scripting error, to be fixed in upcoming patches. This game is a gem.\n\nIt really is a game to buy and expereince yourself. Solid 8.5/10. I will be sinking many hours into this latest Total War masterpiece.","May 28","true","36.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Your ”Legendary Lords” will always be there(if you can avoid a 5 turn assasination wound recovery) and you never feel your progress getting lost or wasted – it's honestly great.\nIt means that you can put your entire heart and soul into becoming the mightiest Lord, without worrying about inevitable death. Needless to say that this fits a fantasy universe perfectly.\n\nAs a new feature your Lord is now a single person instead of being part of a squad, which works wonders – you will no longer suffer from random unlucky deaths of your lord, by simply being unlucky with who dies in his squad. The single unit now works off of a pool of HP, which eliminates that element of luck that haunted killing a captain in previous TW games.\nAs the game progresses and your lord earns levels through glorious combat, he will get some unique questlines to fulfill in order to gain high tier loot, such as powerful weapons and armor – really satisfying and worthwhile to complete. Usually with a fun battle(including cutscene) to end it.\n\nDiplomacy is miles apart from all other TW games – way better, with AI that actually doesn't seem to be controlled by your dog and actively engages in diplomacy.\n\n\nThose were som quick thoughts – 100% recommended as the best TW game so far.","June 5","true","80.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

There are some aspects of the game that may displease Total War fans but the changes all make perfect sense in the context of the Warhammer theme. If you like Warhammer and have longed for a PC version of the tabletop game this is it.\n\nNow for the more detailed account.\n\n\n1: Technical Stuff\n\nThe game seems to be very polished and it runs really well. I have a moderate PC (GTX770, i5-Haswell) and I can run it on ‘Very High’ settings with a very stable 60fps during battles. I did have a bit of an issue with the in-game V-Sync option causing odd screen tearing, but that was sorted by using a software sync in the NVidia panel.\n\nThe tactical map runs well too, and the AI seems to get its turns over nice and quickly. All in all, this game seems to be free from the technical bugs that dogged the Rome II release.\n\n\n2: Changes to the Total War Formula\n\nThe game retains all of the classic Total War gameplay, however it does feel very different to classic Total War games. The focus is much narrower than Rome-II, more in line with that of Shogun-II. One of the biggest changes is the freedom that the fantasy setting has given CA when it comes to making the different playable races unique. Each of the four basic factions have very different rules that govern their approach to battle. The Dwarves, for example, have to redress slights and attacks against them less they become unhappy and start to rebel. The Orcs and Goblins have to keep fighting turn after turn less they start to brawl with one another and suffer attrition. These unique characteristics really seem to change up the way that the tactical side of the game plays and help a great deal when getting into the theme of a given faction.\n\nBut where the game really shines is in the sheer variety of units on offer. Where as in previous TW games most of the armies were composed of some combination of spearmen, swordsmen, archers and cavalry, here the armies contain really characterful and fun units that make them stand out a great deal. The Dwarves, which are the faction I have been playing the most so far, are able to build all manner of crazy war-machines from Gyro-copters (steam powered one-man helicopters) to Organ Guns (mad fantasy Gatling guns). By contrast, the Orcs and Goblins have access to Doom Divers, which see goblins firing themselves out of massive catapults and swooping down into the enemies ranks. There are far too many units to mention here but the main point is simply that each of the armies is unique and fun.\n\nFurthermore, this asymmetrical nature of the armies adds to how the battles play out. Dwarves try to take up defensive lines, making the most of their artillery before finishing off their foe with powerful and heavily armed melee troops. Orcs and Goblins rush in in a massive frenzy and attempt to overwhelm their opponent and so forth.\n\nAnd perhaps finally there is magic. This comes into play differently for each of the various factions. However, it presents itself as either battlefield spells cast by magical units such as wizards and shaman, or as special items that character units can carry into battle in order to boost their abilities. This magic is well integrated into the game, offering an interesting and tactically significant aspect to the battles.\n\n\n3: Worries about content\n\nI’ve heard quite a lot of worry about the fact that there are only four factions in this game. When compare with the massive amount of nations in Rome-II it may seem small. However, as I talked about above, the variety on offer here is tenfold that found in previous TW games. Rather than having myriad Celtic and Greek factions that all play roughly the same, here we have four very different factions, each filled with character and unique design. This in no way feels like a short-changed game.\n\n\n4: Conclusions\n\nAs you can no doubt tell I love this game. It’s all that I was hoping that it would be and a great deal more. I’ve been playing TW games since they first game out. I’ve also played Warhammer table-top many years ago when I was a kid. Bringing the two together here is just fantastic. The fantasy setting seems to have allowed CA to come up with some fantastic ideas and it just feels like it fits the game style so much better than the historical games that they have previously released. I’m in no doubt that this game is going to be one that I play for many years to come.\n\nIf you like TW games, like Warhammer or even better like both then getting this is a no brainer. For those that don’t like the previous TW games but have an interest in the setting it is certainly worth looking into. The game feels better polished than any that have come before it and the theme is rich.\n","May 24","true","26.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TacticalProject/recommended/364360/","TacticalProject","Tactical Librarian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TacticalProject/","41 products in account","I will compare this game with the other Total War games.\nI have played Rome, Rome 2 and Medieval 2 total war.\nI will divide this review in 5 sections: Settlements, Battles, Diplomacy, Campaign and DLCs.\n\nCampaign\nIn this game, you aren't in Europe, Africa or Asia. You are in the world of Warhammer. That has some northern lands, forests and deserts. You play as one of the 4 main factions (5 in you get the DLC): Empire, Dwarves, Orks, Vampires and Chaos (DLC).\nAs you progress through the campaign, you can covince other factions of the same race to join you, gaining all of their cities and armies. You can also conquer them. However, you cannot occupy settlements of a different race,\nAfter you grow strong enough, an evil force will come from the north and their influence can be felt in the entire world. That force is Chaos. They cannot occupy cities, only destroy them. Spoiler for the Warhammer books:  Chaos is the confirmed winner, as seen in the books. They destroy the world.\n\nDiplomacy\nThe diplomatic options are the same as in Rome 2 Total War. You don't need an agent to travel to someone to start diplomacy. You can do this through the diplomacy menu. You can tell your allies where to attack. When Chaos invades, all factions have a diplomatic bonus, which makes you ally with the whole world to fight Chaos.\n\nSettlements\nThe public order system has been greatly simplified. Buildings, technologies, commandments (editcts) and agents increase public order, while recent raids and enemy agents decrease public order. Instead of religion of culture, we now have corruption (vampiric and chaos). Playing as the Vampires means you need Vampiric corruption for your people to be happy, while playing as any other faction means you need to avoid corruption. If you have a lot of chaos corruption in a city, a chaos army will appear and rebel against you. The same goes for vampire coruption. You can lower the corruption with technologies, agents, characters and buildings.\n\nBattles\nCombat was greatly changed. There is no naval combat anymore (only autoresolve) and you can use spells if you have the right skills. There is no dynamic weather or time of day anymore. You can wait before the battle to get better winds of magic (spells recharge faster if there is more wind). You can equip your characters with weapons and armor and other buffs.

It is my favourite total war yet because of the cool af magic and  character models. The game mchcanics are fantastic because they are quicker; in the other total wars they were slow for units to fight eachother. There is alot great ways to play it and many races to play as, such as: Dwarfs the anti-magic and missile people, the chaos who are just pure badasses e.t.c. There is amazing monstrous infantry that destroy your front lines and any units that lay before them. The campaign is quite difficult but that is the pint because were would the fun be in it being easy af.I recommend this game because it is a entertaining game to play in your spare time.","June 2","true","32.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","5","7","2","0"

Sieges are very arcadey deployed right into tower range for example, unit formations are gone, group formations are limited to a couple of options. I don't know if modders will be able to crack these issues, if they can then that's my only hope. In the meantime I'll probably go back to the excellent EB II mod for MTW2. Earlier TW games had much more detail and more options overall with the exception of ship combat for Shogun I, MTW I, Rome I, MTW 2. The series has continued to be simplified more and more which is pretty devastating to people who played the thinking part of the series. The TW series in general has had issues with AI whether CAI, BAI, or DAI, but little has been done to improve it over the years. The focus seems to be more on a cinematic immediate gratification fest rather than a thinking, methodical strategy game.\n\nI was really hoping (I should have known better) that CA would return to their roots in terms of the combat at least, but I was sorely disappointed. No open city fighting either as far as I can tell (or naval combat for that matter). I feel like this is just the way things are gonna be as the series is concentrated on simple accessibility with a lot of flash but less and less substance. I won't say the game isn't fun at all, but knowing how much better it could have been if it was actually designed as thinking man's strategy game.\n\nSince Rome 2 the series has felt like the strategy version of CoD in a way. When I see what modders have been able to do with the EB II mod for MTW2 compared to the simplified systems implemented by CA since Rome 2 it's obvious at this point that what sells is simplicity. If I sound enraged it's because this was one of my favorite franchises (as well as my youngest brother's btw) but since Rome 2 the direction of CA is now overwhelmingly clear; cater to the casual because it makes $$. Can't blame them from a business standpoint, but considering the strategy games I grew up with I have to wonder if it's a generational indicator of where we are now (which makes me want to watch Idiocracy).\n\nTo reiterate, I'm not saying the game isn't fun, I'm just saying it's very, very arcadey and even more so with gutting of tactical options (sure they added magic, but meh that's not really a big deal vs unit tactics/formations.\n\nI still play MTW I, Rome Total War I, and MTW2 on a regular basis. The amount of detail that went into those games AT THE TIME they released was indicative of significant TLC and catered to a different kind of crowd that liked options, detail, traits, etc. There is no such corresponding effort from CA since Rome 2 and this latest entry is no different in that respect; accessibility over substance, simplicity over detail, limitations over options.\n\nFor a Warhammer (as opposed to old guard TW) fan it is worth it, especially if you never played the other TW games WHEN they came out (if you're like my brother and I anyway and want it all: tactical options, improved AI capable of executing sieges with MY OWN planning, etc). Shogun 2 I would say was the last total effort by CA. You can have fun with this game, but I could not in good conscience recommend it to the old guard.","May 25","false","17.0"," 43 of 81 people (53%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","53","43","81","3","2"

Ever since Shogun: Total War launched over fifteen years ago, the series has tackled a variety of historical periods over the past two millennia, with a focus on units and scenarios that kept things firmly grounded in reality. In a turn of events that fundamentally redefines what Total War can be, this latest edition sees the core formula that mixes turn-based strategy with real-time battles married to the decades-old Warhammer fantasy universe. The result is a polished and highly functional strategy title that sacrifices some strategic depth for the novelty of seeing Orcs, wizards and vampires mingling with more traditional Total War units.

Plays well for me personally though I can feel I need a patch from Nvidia. V sync etc doesn't function properly. Other than that I got a smooth 60 frames but my PC is strong too.\nIt has tons of potential. Cool new skill system. Armor and weapon outfitting. Good rosters except for Brettonia. better collision, better Battle AI, slower fights, more realistic. better music than Rome 2 and Attila.\n\nCons:\nPathfinding during siege battles are still ♥♥♥♥ed. Its incredible that CA just cannot get it right. It simply baffles me.\n\nAnd here comes the HUGE one that makes me so angry I can barely contain my rage. What in the ♥♥♥♥.... happened to Siege battles? Where are they? Where are our cities, villages, small fortified siege battles that we've always had. Where are they?\n\nWHere are the cool choke point matches. The tactical setups offered by the village / city design when you knew you were outnumbered and you had to hold off overwhelming enemy numbers like Leonidas as Thermopylae.\n\nIts all gone.\n\n-_- ........!!!!!!!!\n\nAre you ♥♥♥♥ing serious, CA? have you completly lost it?!  You have removed one of the BIGGEST aspects of what made Total war...Total War. A strategy game. Where you fight the enemy tactically.\n\nYour entire ♥♥♥♥ing game now...is Horde Mode. Let me repeat that... Ca....YOUR ENTIRE GAME!...ENTIRE WARHAMMER...is Horde Mode. Except for the Huge city fights that will never change ever because you're so ♥♥♥♥ing lazy and incompetent consist of the enemy zerging 1 direction whilst you camp the walls and afk. Towers are still ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly OP it seems. HIlarious considering we've been complaining about OP ranged since ROME...2. Arguably even Shogun 2 but that was a kamikaze fest anyway so whatever.\n\nI just cannot believe this. I cannot...believe...comprehend.. that after EVERYTHING you still cannot understand what we want from a total war game. Its like you're the Blizzard of Total war. "Give us LEgacy servers to experience the good ol days"  Nope. Ain't gonna happen. ANd here you are doing the same ♥♥♥♥. Removing with every game you release more and more of what makes total war...a REAL total war game.\n\nIt has never been so dumbed down before. I simply can scarcely believe your team of "creative" designers would have the gall to do this. Like wtf is your problem? Is it the AI? Is it the fact that you cannot find or hire or afford a good AI designer? Like wtf is going on? We keep paying full price for this and everytime we get less. Less and less thats STILL broken.\n\nSure it looks good and what IS there is cool. problem is it comes to a price as always with you, CA. And this time its just Bye Bye Siege battles except for the Horde Mode Wall camp one. Everthing else. Every village defense is stripped in your continuous attempt to DUMB down. WHY?! WHY...IN THE ♥♥♥♥....are you dumbing down this game? FOR WHO?! Who wants this?! Who the hell likes to fight the same horde mode battle over and over and over. Its no ♥♥♥♥ing wonder people auto resolve because you keep making your battle more and more ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and casual. This time its awesome eye candy but its REPETATIVE as ♥♥♥♥. THERE IS NO VARIATION.\n\nI dont understand this. I fought a battle before and I was outnumbered 3-1. I was inside my city. I expected to somehow be able to deploy within a village, thus create a choke point and try to fend them off. Classic total war style. Leonidas style. But nope. I just got ported outside the freaking city and TADA.... outnumbered. Outgunned, outmatched, outflanked. And there was absolutely ♥♥♥♥ all I could do about it. Why is that? THATS BECAUSE YOUR ♥♥♥♥ING BATTLE MAP DESIGN IS HORDE MODE....and nothing else. They are small, simplistic, and doesn't at ALL encourage anything but to rush.\n\nHow can you expect...or imagine we'd spend..."enjoy" hundreds of hours playing this if 90 % of the matches are on generic horde mode fields. The magic spells and graphics will wear off in a week. And then what after that? Huh?\n\nPeople complain mostly about the performance. Heh. Mine works and I can tell you. Performance is the least of your troubles after you've been fighting 5-6 times.. I played almost 3 hours and I can already feel how I'm doing the same bloody thing over and over.\n\nIts streamlined. Its very very streamlined and combine that with bad level design and yeah. GG replay value. I'll try to enjoy my gameplay experience because I actually enjoy the concept of the game. But holy mother of god how you ♥♥♥♥ed up. No..you ♥♥♥♥ED US...all of us...by dumbing down siege battles that were ICONIC to total war. Freaking iconic.\n\nThanks for trying to create a Warhammer game. You did well on a lotta things. but ♥♥♥♥ YOU...for once again dropping the ball and ignoring the aspects we love just because you either can't...or wont put in the extra effort and give us the game us fans deserve.\n\nGod damnit, CA.\nIs it a Thumps up or down? Its up if you can handle the siege battles being at their worst ever plus IDIOT CAMPAIGN AI. never attacks, just asks peace every turn. WTF CA! ♥♥♥♥ing hell.\n\nWant siege battles + Good campaign AI = DONT BUY !!\n\nIf you do, dont pay full price if you can avoid it. They haven't given us 100 % effort therefor they dont deserve 60 bucks.\nAnother thing is that every map is so small. Which makes tactical elements harder. its a rush fest by the end of the day. 1 single music track plays with every battle which gets awfully repetative after a while.\n\nAt first I thought I could find some good replay value but after 15 hours of playing...its getting worse. Its so repetative and unrewarding. Its feeling so streamlined and basic. No talent or skill required and I'm steamrolling the AI. Even on very hard. I have noticed the only thing that changes from Easy to Very Hard is that the enemy will actually kill your units instead of just damaging them to 50 % of more. Intelligence doesn't change.\n\nGarrisons make fights hugely unfair. I bought 2500 men to take a town. AI had around 2000 men too. But the garison game it another 1900. Of top elite units and more. And this is around 10-15 turns in. Its hugely unbalanced and in most fights you end up with your legendary heroes standing alone fighting 1000 men alone. Something I expected from a total war mod, but not actual game design.\n\nI cannot recommend this game. Most definately not at full price. I had hoped for an improvement over the MTW 2 Call of Warhammer mod. But this game is not remotely it. Not even close.\nI expect a lot more from my games. Not streamlined to the detriment gameplay with a few extra additions to the campaign at the cost of siege battles being BUTCHERED. Not to mention the AI will either rush you or hill camp. Nothing else. Every battle is the same and hugely predictable. Combine that with everything else and yeah. Not even wall debrie anymore or crumbling visuals. Just gone. Streamlined and lazy\n\nI'm not having a fun time.  As this game stands right now, I cannot recommend it.\nNot getting an epic feel from it. More like a headache from trying to have fun. To enjoy the nice graphics, cool combat though unbalanced.\nBut everytime I almost get there Im slapped by the shitness of this games dumbing down.\nAnd its getting to be too much. I will almost go as far to say this is the most casual total war to date.\nIts worth a buy it if you mod it. But its ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that we gotta Mod CA games everytime now to make them playable or fun.\n\nUPDATE: The game is a total face roll. Mods dont help on that. Legendary is a joke and 60 % of cities are empty. Garrison ♥♥♥♥ defense. Mods dont help. CampaignAI is deeply stupid. Invisible walls in sieges. No reload animations on guns or cannons. List goes on.\nDont buy if you want a challenge!\nThe game doesn't feel finished. This AI passiveness is WORSE than Rome 2's\n\nPLAY THE MOD FROM CALL OF WARHAMMER FOR MTW 2 INSTEAD!

I'm used to a overhead view and micro managment of units, this was an entirely different exprience then I expected.  If you haven't played one of these before, it's going to take quite a bit of time and research to understand to move foward.  Once I invested a decent chunk of time on learning the system and what everything is I was able to expand and move forward and make progress.\n\nThere really isn't any story line or end of the progression,  while you can messure your success each day the value of it demishes rapidly and performing any action or battle becomes mondain and boring, that is to say for me anyway.\n\nThe game is quite polished and feels complete. The Tutorial needs a great deal of work for those that is not going to invest the required time as I did to get going (if you haven't played a Total war game).    But if you want a never ending game that you play for a few hours or a whole weekend for as long as you desire, this game has some great longivity. The Graphics, the races and terrain layout look excellent.\n\nI'm a bit bais on the battles, I enjoy a good fight to the death. This, the battle is over in a short time and the enemy unit flees and get's away.  That takes a lot out of it for me.\n\nIf a demo isn't availible I watch quite a few youtube videos before making the investment. All the videos the players seeemd quite pleased and enjoyed the game, it's likely you could do the same. For me, It just doesn't do anything for me, I really had my heart set on it, I'd like to a find a new RTS that is more current and pleasing such as some of the graphics this game offers.","June 3","false","9.8"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","9","15","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aduna/recommended/364360/","Aduna","Aduna","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aduna/","187 products in account","You have to rate a Total War game in one of two ways, on-line multi-player or "the solo campaign experience".  If you value on-line multi-player, this iteration of Total War is an immediate pass.  There are only four factions before you have to buy DLC, and they are not balanced.  There's nothing like Shogun's II multi-player system: no ranks, no stats, no veteran units, no customization, and no clan system, no balance ...just more stumbles backwards and corners cut from previous Total War offerings. There are also no innovations, it's still only two player co-op/head-to-head on the campaign map, no drop in battles or any expansion of revison of tha tidea, just the basics and bare bones.\n\nThe campaign experience is much better, but still a mixed bag in comparison to previous Total War games.  Primarily, no real strides in campaign AI have been made at all from previous Total War games.  Instead, what CA has done is greatly limit how you can maneuver on the campaign map, channeling you and controlling how you move your armies, and greatly constricting the number of armies you can have in play on the map at one time.  In this way, the AI may "appear" less stupid.  For example, instead of the AI looking at 10 possible choices 1 being right, it now only looks at 2 possible choices, 1 being right.  Thus the AI went from being right 10% of the time to 50% of the time, …so it’s smarter in Warhammer!  … not really, and this reduced option effect is just taken too far.\n\nFor example, you can only take control of your "nemesis" faction settlements, such as Dwarves can control Orc settlements, and vis versa.  But if you as the dwarfs, and want to repay grudges to nearby Vampires, the best you can do is raze their settlements, not occupy them.  You want to conquer the world as the dwarves? Forget it. You can try razing the world though.  There was a DAY 1 mod to address this form the community (with bugs/unsupported), but that's not the point.  The point is this is an example of the many things removed or simplified.\n\nOthers are a total lack of real naval combat, such that you don't even build ships, missing seasons and associated penalties on the campaign map, no dynamic weather on the tactical map either,  you can't adjust your tax rate of your provinces, just turn it on/off, a simplified settlement building system, non-existent religions, and so on.  Just a many, many existing features that were hallmarks of previous Total War games that allowed depth and gave your freedom to be creative or adapt the game to your play style, and gave the game a more sandbox feel ....are gone from Warhammer.\n\nAuto-resolve is also extremely broken, and far too easy to manipulate.  In many cases you can auto-resolve a fight you otherwise couldn’t easily win. Put one artillery piece and a bunch of scrubs in a stack and you can take down walled settlements in the early game with auto-resolve over and over with minimal losses while you could never do that in the tactical map.  The game mechanic of being able to rush walls with a single artillery piece really takes away any reason to siege settlements, as well. And you will want to abuse it when you find out that, siege battles with walled cities are set up so that the defending towers can hit you from your deployment zone as an attacker, such that you have to immediately rush the wall (there is only 1 WALL and one direction to go) haphazardly, creating a frenzied mosh pit of stupidity that AI can handle.\n\nThis isn’t a mistake, it’s a continuation of the “limiting” of choices so the AI can respond better to your moves.  Open field battles are just as bad, and the Total War: Warhammer seems to be the most about using rock/paper/scissors units and timing special abilities with lightning fast battles that are devoid of actual medieval tactics and maneuvers.\n\nWhile CA initially touted how diverse and interesting their maps would be with underground battles, etc., for the most part, the all battles above and below, are mundane and uninteresting, and less diverse than previous total war games.  If a settlement has no walls for example, but you fight over it, the settlement is curiously absent from the tactical map and the battle plays out just like any other open field battle.\n\nWarhammer unit sizes are also less epic comparatively, being smaller than previous total war titles feeling less epic. The do models look good, but how they engage and the one-vs-one combat animations seem lacking.  There’s no dismemberment, blood, decapitations, special kill animations, etc, even the overall graphic quality seems to be a bit less than Total War Attila.\n\nPerformance for Warhammer is improved over Attila (for some, Attila runs fine for me), and Warhammer has weird graphic glitches for me on my 980TI with updated drivers that none of the other Total War games (including Attila) have.  Therese’s also still no UI scaling to make running in resolutions higher than 1080p (such as 4K) comfortable.\n\nIn trade for of the above …what you DO get is a robust and broad research system and general/leader development that, in all fairness, is the best of any Total War game to date.  Additionally, while there are only four factions (aside form DLC), each faction is unique with genuinely unique units, and a different playstyle, and not just a cut and paste with small re-skins or stat changes.  This is an enormously welcome change.  The agents are also more robust, and more interesting to level, and appear on the tactical map iwhen you embed them in yuor armies as specialized units that can be killed there, with their own abilities and roles along with their campaign map duties, which is ABSOLUTELY fantastic.  These additions are so good that it “almost” makes up for the other issues, such that I am hesitant to give Total War: Warhammer a negative rating.\n\n…but I will, and primarily because I don’t think CA tried hard enough to integrate working systems they had previously created and implemented in other Total War titles in this iteration.  It was probably done this way to make the game more approachable by non-total War fans, but in so doing, it left their most avid and loyal fans, like me, by the way side.","June 1","false","59.4"," 29 of 54 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","29","54","2","0"

No technical faults my end, all graphics maxed, appears to be well optimized in my experience.\n==========\n\nFor a Warhammer game it sure is skinny on the carnage, like by alot.  In Shogun2, theres blood, limb dismemberment and people rolling and withering on the ground who werent lucky for a quick death. FOTS brought Cannon fire that came down like the fists of an angry god and the fields become covered in a ghostly fog.  I would think a Warhammer game would have taken that noise up to 11.  Guess the blood god can go **** himself.\n\nCombat animations feel really default and at times makes me think im watching a korean mmo than a TW game.  Lots of units hanging out and taking turns poking each other with the sharp end of the stick sort of deal, or ranged units landing shots but not seemingly having the effect they used to in previous TW games ive played...even if the targets were rocking shields, something about arrow units feeling more passive than impacting.\n\n\nOverall id recommend it if your intrested in the Warhammer or high fantasy scene. It plays well, but it dosent seem to be gripping me personally all that well.\n\nWill change my vote to a recommendation when I can blood for the blood god.","May 24","false","3.1"," 109 of 210 people (52%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","52","109","210","8","3"

Agents/heroes are amazing, magic is great, much of the changes made to the campaign map are fantastic and campaign map is actually difficult and dynamic and interesting. Diplomacy is worse and almost non existant though.\n\nProps should be given to CA for their marketing team being honest and giving us real gameplay, they have made up for the Rome II debacle. DLC is already here to ♥♥♥♥ it all up of course, but as you probably know that is par for the course these days with Total War.\n\nGame is beautiful, wonderfully optimized, and relatively bug free.\n\nBUT gameplay is the least strategic and tactical that we have gotten yet. Battles are SHORT (10 minutes) rush battles, you don\'t even have time to proper flank or cycle charge or maneuver units, and that is not a micro issue, that is a simply the game ends too fast issue. The silver lining to that is it makes the AI seem more intelligent, since all it can do is rush and that is all a human can do these days as well.\n\nMultiplayer is a joke and broken as hell. Why? Because 50% of the time the winning team simply spammed a single unit, either a hero or monster unit. There are no penalties or drawbacks to spams unlike in past total war games, those are desperately needed. And you thought fights against the AI lacked strategy.\n\nSiege battles? Pah! They are a joke. sieges are a single wall (not even a fort you surround, just a single wall on a single side of a fort, of which you cannot actually enter), once the battle for the wall is over, the game is over. And every siege battle is, and has to be, a boring rush battle. And you would think that with such a narrower focus they could make more variety in the sieges, but nope, every siege in every location for every faction is identical.\n\nYes, mods will probably be to the rescue. But they are largely not here yet or still in infancy stages. When they are, I will update this.","June 1","false","94.2"," 34 of 64 people (53%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","53","34","64","4","0"

I enjoyed wiping out the greenskins, and I was genuinely frightened of chaos when they first appeared. I liked the gyrobombers, and nothing really came close to seeing an entire chaos warhound charge crumple under 4 squads of Irondrakes setting them on fire. The battles were genuinely fun, and it reminded me very much of the original table top game. So I enjoyed that bit, and it's ultimately what made me keep playing.\n\nAs the campaign wore on, though, and I realized how underwhelming chaos was, it came to a point where there was nothing left on the map but me, dwarves I hadn't assimilated yet, and the humans of Bretonnia and The Empire. My turns became nothing but cycling through the towns, managing what was being built, recruiting replacements for my 7 or 8 armies that were on the move, trying to make sure my two main quest-driven characters didn't get assassinated, and hitting "next turn" a lot more then I really felt was necessary. After mopping up Barak Varr (leaving me with just 2 dwarf factions left to claim) I knew the game was pretty much a forgone conclusion, but I had to sit through it. It wasn't fun anymore, it was just tedious.\n\nSo I thought I'd try Chaos instead. Tried them out (got the expansion for free) and found that it was even more "next turn" waiting, though the combat in battles was more fun due to having mounted units. Still, the waiting was awful. I'd camp after sacking something and it would take 4 minutes to get to a point where my army was safe enough to move on. There was no time-limit. No sense of urgency. It was just "you know, meander on down south when you get a chance. Destroy the other chaos tribes, if you want. Who cares." It also didn't feel like Chaos. I can't really put my finger on it, but the army didn't feel like a ravenous hungry mob of crazy chaos worshipers and demons. It felt like a regular army with chaos skins.\n\nThe game was fun for a bit, but the really 2 dimensional diplomacy (wiping out dwarfs was not what I signed up for as a dwarf), the long wait times between turns, the fact that you can't really play those other factions in campaign mode, the fact that the campaign victory conditions are just tedious, and the fact that chaos warriors (the faction) is just kinda meh... it means I can't really recommend this game unless it's on sale. It had its moments, but they came in between stretches of boredom or tedium. It's just not a very fleshed out game, by the feel of it, though it is bug free as far as I can tell and the battles are fun.\n\n\nTL;DR The battles are fun, the campaign map is tedious, the DLC is not worth the money. Get it on sale if you get it at all.","June 2","false","45.5"," 19 of 35 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","19","35","2","0"

When my dwarven Lord was last man standing against wounded goblin shaman, three trolls, some spider riders and two half beaten spear gobbo regiments i thought its over... but somehow I wished for glorious death and fought them trying to avoid heavy hitting trolls biting myself against regiments of gobbos. Shaman was running around and supporting with some spells or abilities. I fought them for like next 7-8 MINUTES!!! slashing and killing one troll and many goblins until that scum Shaman came too close and died by my bloody AXE! And they all fled.

I felt the single campaign was very captivating. Nothing like trapping The Everchosen in Blackfire Pass with six armies ready for WAAAGH!\n\nI ended up liking the fact I couldn't occupy human/undead settlements It actually helped. It encouraged me to branch out towards the north and west instead of turtle up. The greenskins can aquire a great amount of raiding wealth and fil that fightness bar up by letting humans occupy their land.\n\nI enjoyed the army compositions of all the factions except Bretonnia. Understandable since its not a playable faction (yet)  but for multiplayer it could use CA to fill out some missing elements.\n\nI am disappointed with the seige change. I understand the wanted to make seiges quick and simple ( and succeeded) but because of that the replayability of those battles are completely diminished because its just a rush to the walls. Defending corridors and city centers are completely superfluous. I also hoped the Karaks to have a great range of varity with tunnels and such to make thier sieges compeletly different.\n\nThe magic was visually stimulating but had minimal effect to not seem overpowered. I wish the lores where alittle more lorefriendly but what ever.\n\nI hope to see Skaven, Highelves, Beastmen, Skeleton Kings in the future. Would be epic to see more Chaos Gods variation and I whisper of a dream of Ogre Kingdoms and Chaos Dwarves in the Darklands.","May 28","true","27.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Just one day after release i just played 24 hours. Best Total War of the Series and combined with Warhammer ... I love it pls more of it !! :D\n\nNow some Details to help the guys who are maybe undecided.\n\nWell i played every part since Medieval II Total war and i must say the new installment is refreshing und fun. A big beautiful and immersive map, all now 5 avaible races are fun and you can enjoy their differences in more than every other part of total war because their are now Humans, Dwarves,Orcs,Undead and the forces of Chaos.\n\nAlso i really love the Characte costumization !! Decide if your General/Commander rides a horse or goes on foot. Decide wich armor and weapons he wields.\n\nTo keep it short if you like strategy games go buy it. If you like warhammer go buy it. If you like the total war series go buy it.\n\nI´m really happy to say the game is worth every penny !\n\ngreetings from Germany\n\nand for Sigmar Heldenhammer !\nHave fun in the world of warhammer i look forward for expansions!\n\n(sorry for maybe bad english)","May 26","true","57.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

So when I booted this up I expected mabye 40 FPS on high. What I got though was around 50-60 fps on ultra.\n\nCampaign:  The campaign is great, you truly feel that every race is uniqe and they all play quite differently. As someone who usually played legendary on other TW games this one provided a new challenge to me and I had to bump it down to hard after my first few attempts as the greenskins.\n\nLarge Units/Magic:  These guys are amazing. It feels incredible to send in a giant spider as your line is crumbling or using your hero's flame spiral to destroy theirs. You can really feel they power of each spell, or eachstomp as they tear into the enemy.\n\nBattle:  The battles in TW W absolutely stun me. From towering giants to shambling zombies I feel like the devs had a dream, and they fulfilled that dream. Everything feels so well balanced and the units look amazing.\n\nLords:  Having quests and skill trees is really great. It makes everything feel very open ended and allows large amounts of replayability.\n\nThe Bad\nBugs:  Playing through the game your going to find bugs. Lots of them. Most of these will be fixed within a few weeks but it must be included. So far I haven't found any gamebreaking bugs but that doesn't mean they aren't there.\n\nPerformance (Again):  As said previously I have great performance. However loads of people are saying that they get terrible FPS so make sure to look into whether or not your comp can run it.\n\nMultiplayer  If its possible I think that the MP might have gotten worse since Attila. There are less options (Time of day, attacker direction, world map) and it crashes occasionally.\n\nAnd The Misc  Arcade  Now, I'm not saying that this is a bad thing, but it must be included that the battles are much faster then in any previous TW game.\n\nEconomy  Since Attila all aspects like food/sanitation have been removed. Personally I hated the way Attila handled it but for those who like managing cities I just wanted to let you know.\n\nDo you guys think I covered everything well? If not leave a comment and I will include it in the review.","May 25","true","132.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","3"

The Battles seem more hectic due to huge creatures and such smashing into your lines. Each race is really unique making starting as a new one tough and forcing you to change your tactics. Certain things have been simplified such as not dealing with food or sanitation however you gotta deal with corruption and various different scenarios that can happen. Textures are amazing and simply the best unmodded textures of a vanilla total war. There are ofc little things I would like to change which mods allow. I personally can't wait for more races to be added in cause south western portion of the map doesn't really have much of a purpose so far.","May 24","true","50.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This secured that flank. I had two regions fully controlled and fully upgraded, one for units the other for economy. I was making thousands a turn, while having access to all available units and fielding two, then three armies.\n\nSo, I'm growing, conquering, destroying. I attack the weak, the ones with only one or two settlements. I ignore the orcs which have a good chunk of the map, and an empire faction which also as a few cities and armies by me.\n\nI make another faction a vessel and let them grow since I start and end wars before they can mobilize. At this point I have 3 full high tier armies, one down south trying to find easy prey to conquer, two in my region keeping me safe.\n\nWhen bam, chaos comes along. I knew this would happen, but... I didn't realize how bad it would be. Chaos itself has four armies, each moving together, destroying everything. And the barbarian tribes are also moving hard, over a dozen armies between them.\n\nThey take my vessels second city, the one they got last turn, and four armies surround their capital the same turn. Over the next two turns I'm martialing my forces, pulling my third army back as fast as I can. My vessels armies get wiped out, but my banshee managed to destroy two full armies by successfully killing the lords leading them. Over the next few turns my vessel gets killed, and I can't help since my two armies would be fighting five armies from the barbarians, and four from chaos.\n\nSuddenly the gods decide to favor me, and the ever chosen is left behind, just out of range of range of the other chaos armies so I pounce, my lord attacks him, he retreats. My second lord attacks him, and together my armies destroy his without losing a single group. Great right? It gets better, the empire, which are friendly with me, get a few confederations and vessels that Same turn, and just in my region have three armies fighting the barbarian tribes.\n\nNext turn... Chaos reacts, two of their lords attack me, and I know if I retreat that will split my two armies apart. So, I fight. Two armies against two, mine have units going from nearly dead to a quarter health missing. I take out their artillery with my air units when their moving their armies to meet, fatal mistake for many of them. My calvalry engages theirs when I tried to flank. My armies are fighting their two lords, each of them flinging dozens of zombies and goals and skeletons a hit. But my armies were keeping their armies back at the same time, bam, the first enemy lord falls to the count leeching life from him in one massive spell. bam the second follows when my count slams into him with his undead flying horse, blade tearing through the massive birds skull. But what? Chaos refuses to give in! And so I battle and battle, doing everything I can to induce as much fear as I can, flanking to destroy moral even further. When their two giants come into the fray. My air units are harassing their units which were split apart, my two lords and my armies are fighting their giants with all they have. No more magic to use to heal or kill, low health on everything with the two giants only a quarter down. Enemy soldiers still coming, refusing to give up and retreat.\n\nI have two air units left, out of the original five, which included an undead dragon, my lords are both nearly dead, my armies are nearky broken, and the enemy still has those damned Giants. It was a loss, my fate had been sealed when their monstrous units entered the fray to help the Giants. But it was a close call, and it was one that bought me just enough time to survive as a faction. I didn't even get besieged.\n\nThe empire, my friends, are pushing back the barbarian tribes, and chaos was nice enough to free up some settlements to my north, my fate is not at an end, if anything, this defeat will bring me future glory.\n\n10/10, would die again.","May 28","true","25.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I am doing this because the developers truly deserve a pat on the back for this. For those of you who do not know Warhammer, the best comparible popular substitute would be Warcraft 3 for themes. This is an amazing adaptation of both Warhammer and Total War, and an improvement on Total War in seemingly every mechanic. This is a game that will addict you and make you care passionately about the faction you choose to play and every decision you make.\n\nI have played Total War games since Shogun, the first one, and this is the first Total War game since being a child that has pulled me in and made me really feel like I am actually apart of this other world. I never played a single faction's Total War campaign as long as I have in this one. I am shocked at how much better the AI has performed, both in campaign strategy, and in the battles and I know that was not an easy accomplishment. When I am supposed to win, I still suffer decent casualties on normal difficulty (not saying I'm the best strategiest, but if I was favored in previous games it was a complete waste of time to fight because I'd lose 10% of my forces at most). I know this is the first Total War where auto-resolve has actually, frequently cost me fewer casualties!\nI know the theme of this game might not be admired by some fans, but it is a personal favorite of mine. I love both Warhammer 40k stories and Warhammer Fantasy and this is an amazing adaptation for both games giving and taking everything I could possibly have imagined this company doing to deliver on this. I personally hope CA/SEGA keep this particular group going with DLCs and/or sequals/expansions.\n\nAdditional notes, the game has certain management features simplified because of the theme and I love that change for campaign about the most. You very quickly understand all the hows and whys of your faction, but yet will find yourself realizing there were much more effecient ways you could have run all of it and will want to play again.\nSome very rare bugs that probably will get sorted out that caused my game to crash a couple times on the same battle. I unfortunately had to auto resolve it but luckily still won the battle (was trying to wound the everchosen's powerful army).\nI'm on Ultra settings with a GTX 980 and it's running smooth, and temp is topping out at 81c (safe). I have a bit of an old harddrive and no SSD so I have some long load screens on this game, but don't normally experience large load times on other games so that's just warning for others, but I don't mind because you do not face many load screens.\n\nThis game was definitely worth the money. I am beyond satisfied and can't wait for additional content.","May 27","true","78.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Wanted to mainly comment on the game's performance and optimization thus far.  Running great and better than expected on my laptop of all things!  I was expecting 30 to 45 fps on high settings with a few settings at medium-ish.  However, I am getting solid 40 to 50 fps with Ultra settings with a couple of settings on high.  All of this at 1080.\n\nMachine:\nMSI GT72S 6QE Dominator Pro G\nWindows 10\nGTX 980M w/8 GB\ni7 6820 HK 2.7 ghz\n32 GB Ram\n\nAgain, expected okay fps on High settings, actually getting okay fps on Ultra.  This has held solid through moderately sized battles with moderate amounts of effects going on.  Only drops a bit during very intense and large battles.  Has yet to 'chug'.  GPU heat has maintained acceptable levels.\n\nGameplay is solid.  I prefer the UI over other Total War games.  Seems a bit more intuitive this time around.  The Warhammer setting is perfect for the Total War series.\n\nEven this early, I would recommend.\n\nI will update if I encounter any serious issues.\n\nEdit: The above performance is with AC plugged in.

A story of a great Empire that spanned many settlements and forts, all united under one banner and quelled the petty squabbling of lesser nobles. Marching under this one banner they led mighty charges against the Orkish hordes, but there numbers were endless. Running low on money and reserves as the war had been at a stalemate for many many moons.... at this bleakest point a message was delivered to our lord. Chaos had arrived, we had heard rumblings of these hordes grouping in the Northern wastes. But that was many months ago now. Then like a blackness in the dead of night, chaos descended on the Empire. Towns  and settlements fell  along with armies of highly trained troops. Messages from Nule of rebellions. Even more disturbing was the fact that no orks had been seen in a  few weeks. At last reports came though of the war in the south... Chaos was there too... It had consumed almost every nation and all that was left were the brave men of the empire, holding the line against a foe that would not yield or relent. The war continues.... for now....\n\n\n\nThis game is so much fun.

The small tabletop figures were abundant at my friend's house and I took a liking to them straight away. Total War does a fantastic job bringing those tiny figures to life.\n\nWhile the game does stray from the past experiences, it brings a new aspect of Total War to the table (no pun intended). You control one of the game's factions, from the Human Empire, to the Chaos Warriors (badass). The similarities between the past games and this one are very similar. Diplomacy, trading, building your towns and armies. Where the similarities end are the battles.\n\nMagic now plays a part and it is really fun to use, and can change the tide of battle instantly if used correctly. Heroic figures now play a HUGE part in your battles (Wizards, Witch Hunters, Captains, etc etc.) And their upgrades can be very useful towards giving your armies an edge.\n\nThe main factions you can choose from are: The Empire, The Greenskins (Orcs), The Vampire Counts, The Dwarfs, and the Chaos Warriors (which you can get if you buy it this week, instead of just pre-ordering it. GG Creative/Sega)\n\nWhat I liked:\n\n+ Similarities are abundant to previous games\n+ Interesting quests and missions given during campaign\n+ Agents (AKA: Heroes and Lords) play a bigger part compared to previous games\n+ Very fun, nostalgic, well crafted with minimal bugs and glitches (so far)\n\nWhat I disliked:\n\n- Performance despite specs capable of running it maxed\n- No gore, clunky animations for fighting\n- Can be a bit hard to grasp for newcomers\n\n\nThis is an early impression, but I liked what I saw, and hope they support this game with the same amount of content (in a reasonable price range for the love of ♥♥♥♥!)\n\n","May 25","true","14.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The main portion of the games plays like a combat-oriented version of Civ V, but the battles allow you to manually control your armies. Currently, there are some balance issues with the Auto-Resolve feature being under/overpowered depending on army compositions, and the enemy AI has a serious issue with spamming Agents to impede your progress.

If you use an older driver, that might help clear up some issues you might face with the game in terms of FPS. I will remove this warning once I know how the new driver will work for Warhammer.\n\nFirst Impressions review, with about two hours in the game. To give you an idea as to what I am playing with and to what my FPS with everything set to high.\n\n-Intel(R) Core(TM) I5-6600k @ 3.50GHz\n-Nvidia Geoforce GTX 770 Superclocked at 4 gigs of VRAM\n-8 Gigs of DDR5 -7.92 usuable\n-DX 12\n-Driver version – 368.22\n-Resolution – 1920 x 1080, 60 GHz\n\nFramerate is stable at 45-60 FPS on campaign map and 50 FPS on battlemap with full stacks; have yet to try more than one full stack. One thing I do want to make known is that if you remember my warning from earlier, I had an older driver and my FPS was stable at 55 fps on campaign but now fluctuates\n\nPros:\n-Game runs great with superior optimization compared to titles in the past, and I have to admit that this game is probably the best launch in the series.\n\n-Beautiful graphics\n\n-64 bit supported now, so game used more RAM than previous games\n\n-Strategic View was overhauled from Rome 2 and Attila giving you more information like road netwoks, faction opinion of you, etc.\n\n-Straightforward and hero units are now more effective than before requiring the player to chose between having a melee/magical infinity Legendary Lord or specialize him in improving your army.\n\n-Quest system is pretty impressive for first runaround, but after a while becomes repetitive. One good aspect though is that you can magically teleport your army to the area for a measly 5k gold.\n\n-Factions play differently from one another. For example, the Empire can march a fair distance in open ground where as the Dwarves cannot; however, the Dwarves can use the underway to bypass large mountain ranges where as the Empire cannot.\n\nCons:\n\n-No naval battles, though I usually autoresolved them in every game they were in except for Empire and Napoleon which IMHO were the best naval battles in the series until Shogun 2 Fall of the Samurai.\n\n-No regional tax rate slider, so if you want to raise or lower taxes, you have to do it through the faction wide tax slider.\n\nMixed:\n\n-Five factions which while seems like a con at first is actually pretty good seeing as they have an entirely different play style to other factions.\n\n-Simplistic province control.\n\nHere is my settings:\n\nAnti-aliasing – MLAA\nTexture filerting – Anisotropic 16x\nWater detail – Ultra\nGrass detail – Ultra\nTerrain detail – Ultra\nBuilding detail – Ultra\nUnit size – Ultra\nPorthole quality – 2d\nTexture quality – Ultra\nShadow detail – Ultra\nVFX detail – High\nTree detail – Medium\nUnit detail – Ultra\nDepth of field – off\n\nUnlimited video memory - On\nProximity fading – On\n\nI'll run an analysis on Ultra once a stable driver is released by Nvidia.","May 26","true","6.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The small tabletop figures were abundant at my friend's house and I took a liking to them straight away. Total War does a fantastic job bringing those tiny figures to life.\n\nWhile the game does stray from the past experiences, it brings a new aspect of Total War to the table (no pun intended). You control one of the game's factions, from the Human Empire, to the Chaos Warriors (badass). The similarities between the past games and this one are very similar. Diplomacy, trading, building your towns and armies. Where the similarities end are the battles.\n\nMagic now plays a part and it is really fun to use, and can change the tide of battle instantly if used correctly. Heroic figures now play a HUGE part in your battles (Wizards, Witch Hunters, Captains, etc etc.) And their upgrades can be very useful towards giving your armies an edge.\n\nThe main factions you can choose from are: The Empire, The Greenskins (Orcs), The Vampire Counts, The Dwarfs, and the Chaos Warriors (which you can get if you buy it this week, instead of just pre-ordering it. GG Creative/Sega)\n\nWhat I liked:\n\n+ Similarities are abundant to previous games\n+ Interesting quests and missions given during campaign\n+ Agents (AKA: Heroes and Lords) play a bigger part compared to previous games\n+ Very fun, nostalgic, well crafted with minimal bugs and glitches (so far)\n\nWhat I disliked:\n\n- Performance despite specs capable of running it maxed\n- No gore, clunky animations for fighting\n- Can be a bit hard to grasp for newcomers\n\n\nThis is an early impression, but I liked what I saw, and hope they support this game with the same amount of content (in a reasonable price range for the love of ♥♥♥♥!)\n\n","May 25","true","14.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The main portion of the games plays like a combat-oriented version of Civ V, but the battles allow you to manually control your armies. Currently, there are some balance issues with the Auto-Resolve feature being under/overpowered depending on army compositions, and the enemy AI has a serious issue with spamming Agents to impede your progress.

Total War games are a RTS game where you lead huge armies into battle. In campaigns you'll choose a faction and begin managing settlements/cities on an world map. Your goal is to take over the entire campaign map. You can build armies and send them off to fight in the wars you'll start. Now you can choose to auto-resolve the battles or you can command the armies yourself on the battle map. This is where the Total War series shine. On battle maps you'll send units groups to fight the enemy, and you are encourage to use tactics such as flanking, rear attacks, taking the high ground, and etc. to win the battle.\n\nNow onto this latest entry into the franchise:\n\nTotal War: Warhammer is the first Total War game to break away from a historical setting and chose to go with a fantasy setting.  But the overall theme of the Total War campaigns is still the same formula; manage cities to get a good economy so that you can build huge armies to take over the campaign map. There are some unique changes depending on which faction you play as. Speaking of factions, this Total War game have got some of the least factions available for the player to use. With past Total War game having around 10 factions, this on only have 3 (4 if you get the preorder/week 1 purchase DLC). But with past Total War game, some of these factions was very similar to each other in play style but in there is none of that in this game. Each faction army rooster come with unique units and there no shared unit between them. So this lead to unique play style and army builds with each factions. At first I was on the fence with the limited number factions, but after seeing how different each are, I think in this case fewer is better.\n\nOn the campaign map, one big change Creative Assembly did was make it so that not every settlement on the map could be taken over. Dwarven and Orcish stronghold can't be occupied by the Empire and Vamp Count (and vice versa Orcs and Dwarves can't occupy human settlements). This is the first time Total War have disable the player from taking over the entire map. Now when I first heard this I was worried, especially since armies can take attrition damage as they travel through enemy territories. But you are able to sack them limited them useless to the enemy force them to send an army over there to rebuild the settlement, for a pretty huge fee. It also give you a good amount of loot for doing this. It’s an interesting new mechanic. I’m not saying it bad or good (I haven’t been in a campaign long enough for it make a huge impact on me).\n\nAlso another huge feature is magic and lords. Lords serve as general to your armies. Lords generally come in 2 categories: Warrior or Mage. Basically warrior types can take on whole unit with ease, and mage types can cast spells. Lords can tip the scale for fight into your favor. Since they are so powerful, you need to make a judgement of when it worth using them and when to keep them safe. On the campaign map you can level up your lords, and equip them with items and take them on quest to get more items and powerups to make the all the more fearsome on the battle map.\n\nMagic basically is represented in the lower right corner of the battle map and will refill as the battle goes on. Using it at the right time can change the outcome of a fight. On the campaign map there is a feature known as the winds of magic. Basically if the winds are strong, then you’ll have a lot of magic to use on the battle map, but if they are week, you could have none.\nI wish I could speak more on how well this game represent Warhammer, but I’ve never played Warhammer before. So I can’t speak on how well it keep to the lore and spirit of the franchise.\n\nNow I’ve only been talking about single player because I haven’t played multiplayer yet. But from what I saw it fairly basic. You got your custom matches, quick battles, and co-op campaigns. With all this new stuff that they added to the single player campaign, I would have expected some new to the multiplayer.\n\nAll it all, I found this a refreshing new entry in the Total War franchise. I know many people had technical problems at launch, but the only problem I had was a slight drop in frames. Once I change the setting to high from ultra and I’ve haven’t had an issue since (my specs: i7-4790, GTX 960, 8GB RAM). It’s kind a funny this game run better on my machine than Total War: Rome 2. I’ve had a lot of fun with this game, and can’t wait to playing this some more, especially with all the free DLC that CA announced for this game.","May 24","true","36.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Units remain in formation unless they are devastated by cavalry,then their formation is broken and they can't reform IN COMBAT.That's a huge bonus.Flanking is actually possible now.\n\n-Optimization is 4x better than Attila.While I can barely run attila at 40 fps with the same tweaks,I get solid 60 fps in TWW.\n\n-Graphics are really good,even though I don't have shadows.Those unit models are awesome just to stare at.\n\n-Cavalry charges IMPROVED IMMENSELY.They actually WRECK infantry.I even saw a unit fly 10 meters away from his friends.\n\n-Legendary Lords are epic.They give you the "I'm more powerful than the rest" feeling.Watching Kholek smash infantry around him never gets old.\n\n-Magic is fun as hell.It is actually both fun,and extremely rewarding if you time your casts.Debuffs are a priority if your mainline is losing the combat.Debuff the enemy,voila ! Your line is not shaking anymore,go support them ! Lots and lots of new possibilities.\n\n-Campaing map is extremely detailed.There are random arachnarok spiders and stuff every now and then.\n\n-Random campaing events are fun to read.Like some random ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ nurgle warriors come and "bless" your warriors,resulting in -growth for your horde.\n\n-Voice acting is awesome\n\nCons :\n\n-Loading screens are 2x longer than Attila.You get bored while waiting.\n\n-High learning curve for new players.I lost 3 55-turn campaings because I was unfamiliar with the magic system.\n\n-Artillery shooting at the tree in front of them,resulting in their own crews dying.\n\n-Sieges are a bit harder for the attackers.They get cannons/arrows raining down on the right after starting the battle.\n\n-Game is A LOT more micro-intensive.\n\n\nIf you are a TW veteran,try this game out.\nIf you are a Warhammer fan,buy the game.You won't regret it.\n\n","May 24","true","99.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

When it had launched, the first twenty-four hours the game was practically unplayable for me due to constant screen tearing, flickering, and crashing. I had decided to put the game to the side for a day or so until I figured a fix or something would be out.\n\nMaking the decision to put the game down for a bit was a great idea. I say this since the game did a total 180 in quality within those hours. The game went from completely unplayable to a very smooth and enjoyable experience. I'm not sure if a majority of people are having the same experience as me now, but if they are then the game is totally worth it.\n\nAt first, I was worried that I had completely wasted my money on this, the same feeling of being burnt when ROME 2 had launched a few years back. While frustrated with the terrible launch, I decided to play other games for a while until a fix was released. Once I had seen that the fix was released and some more time had gone by, I finally got to play and ENJOY Total War: Warhammer and look forward to what the future holds with this game.","May 26","true","9.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Gives me the feels like LOTRS with the Army, the dwarfs, the orcs. I enjoy the Chaos and Vamp army as well. The beasts are OP. I hope this game adds more armies to it like maybe.. Elves? :P","May 24","true","10.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game is amazing if it works, now it works fine for me but i heard about someone who had a crash at the start of every campaign. But anyway, to begin with this is a solid Total War game. My experience has been rather good, its got all your expected Total War features but the fantasy setting spices it up a lot giving the game many good new features, such as hereos you can level up and customise (by the way you can rename cities and individual units not just heroes) there are cool new beasties to command including flying ones which work well as far as i have seen as does the magic, the quests are pretty neat too. I recommend this game because it is a good Total War game and all the elements that Warhammer bring in work very well providing a very satifying experience. If you guys get it i wish you luck and hope it works fine. I currently run this on high, the same preset i have on Attila but i find this game running nicer and prettier than Attila did. Good luck guys and to those of you who get this i hope you enjoy what is in my opinion possibly my farvorite Total War title.","May 24","true","122.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I wish there were more units but i'm sure we will get more via free lc and dlc packs (most important however is the blood dlc that im sure will come out next month following how all other total wars do the blood packs) The large flying monsters and flying beasts as well as magic give the game a unique feeling that is totally different from past total wars. I wish all legendary lords could ride mounts such as Sigvard the Magnificent who is just a human dude who cant even ride a horse for some odd reason and Archeon only gets a little horse when a regular lord can mount a chaos dragon is just odd, something im sure modders will fix so np. Mods for the game are great and already after a few hours of release tons of them are being released that improve on the game. A great addition total war and I cant wait for next years expansions and any upcoming historical total wars CA as in store for us as this has been a great launch for me.\n\nmy play time should speak for itself, games been out for 1 day and i have 20 hrs of gameplay, games pretty great cant believe im saying this but i can wait for the incoming dlc\n\nI would also warn those new to the game to not gauge how battles are going based on previous total war games, this game is unique in that it has monsters and magic, a battle that may seem like it will be a sure  win can suddenly turn the other way around if someone shoots a comet in the right place\n\n9/10\n\n(has some minor glitches such as alittle screen flickering when starting campaign and AI aggression is pretty op atm if your chaos but nothing that cant be fixed easily and is overall a great total war experience)","May 24","true","36.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Your armies stand ready to fight, taunting the enemy, under a beautiful scenery of which you can use any part of it, to your advantage (or disadvantage). Send your infantry forward, have your cavalry hiding in a forest, engage your opponents outnumbered 1:3, and when they thought they won, that is when you send your cavalry around their whole army to charge into your enemies back. Watch them react in panic, as they throw down their banners, and flee the battlefield. Watch your infantry laugh at them running away in fear, as your mighty cavalry now charges into the enemies crossbow soldiers. As soon as those soldiers see your horse, they throw down their weapons and flee in panic. You, Lord Reader of this Review, under my guidance and under my command, you shall bring me the head of my enemies, and most importantly, you shall bring me the head of all the leaders of my enemies, as my hall is in dire need of their skulls that shall be turned into my personal drinking cups.

Not only are the graphics and mechanics very good, but the game goes a long way to make the world feel alive and deep. Playing a campaign as Chaos, I was having a really good time not worrying about much than what city to burn down next, and how cool the next unlocked unit is going to look. Also seeing the tribes you've raised following you and building up cities from the ruins that lie in your wake, before some infighting establishes one of them as a dominant norse power is fun.\n\nAfter 15+ hours of Chaos, I got a bit tired, so I switched to the Vampire Count campaign. And it's like starting up a whole new and different Total War game. New mechanics, new play style and tons of new fun. The 4(5) different factions basicly means 4(5) different games in one.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShadowRFox/recommended/364360/","ShadowRFox","ShadowRFox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShadowRFox/","225 products in account","Okay, I was going to wait a little while to write the review, but with all the negative reviews about people unable to play it; I figured I better chime in.\n\nIf you never played a Total War game let me give you a summary of what to expect. Total War games are a RTS game where you lead huge armies into battle. In campaigns you'll choose a faction and begin managing settlements/cities on an world map. Your goal is to take over the entire campaign map. You can build armies and send them off to fight in the wars you'll start. Now you can choose to auto-resolve the battles or you can command the armies yourself on the battle map. This is where the Total War series shine. On battle maps you'll send units groups to fight the enemy, and you are encourage to use tactics such as flanking, rear attacks, taking the high ground, and etc. to win the battle.\n\nNow onto this latest entry into the franchise:\n\nTotal War: Warhammer is the first Total War game to break away from a historical setting and chose to go with a fantasy setting.  But the overall theme of the Total War campaigns is still the same formula; manage cities to get a good economy so that you can build huge armies to take over the campaign map. There are some unique changes depending on which faction you play as. Speaking of factions, this Total War game have got some of the least factions available for the player to use. With past Total War game having around 10 factions, this on only have 3 (4 if you get the preorder/week 1 purchase DLC). But with past Total War game, some of these factions was very similar to each other in play style but in there is none of that in this game. Each faction army rooster come with unique units and there no shared unit between them. So this lead to unique play style and army builds with each factions. At first I was on the fence with the limited number factions, but after seeing how different each are, I think in this case fewer is better.\n\nOn the campaign map, one big change Creative Assembly did was make it so that not every settlement on the map could be taken over. Dwarven and Orcish stronghold can't be occupied by the Empire and Vamp Count (and vice versa Orcs and Dwarves can't occupy human settlements). This is the first time Total War have disable the player from taking over the entire map. Now when I first heard this I was worried, especially since armies can take attrition damage as they travel through enemy territories. But you are able to sack them limited them useless to the enemy force them to send an army over there to rebuild the settlement, for a pretty huge fee. It also give you a good amount of loot for doing this. It’s an interesting new mechanic. I’m not saying it bad or good (I haven’t been in a campaign long enough for it make a huge impact on me).\n\nAlso another huge feature is magic and lords. Lords serve as general to your armies. Lords generally come in 2 categories: Warrior or Mage. Basically warrior types can take on whole unit with ease, and mage types can cast spells. Lords can tip the scale for fight into your favor. Since they are so powerful, you need to make a judgement of when it worth using them and when to keep them safe. On the campaign map you can level up your lords, and equip them with items and take them on quest to get more items and powerups to make the all the more fearsome on the battle map.\n\nMagic basically is represented in the lower right corner of the battle map and will refill as the battle goes on. Using it at the right time can change the outcome of a fight. On the campaign map there is a feature known as the winds of magic. Basically if the winds are strong, then you’ll have a lot of magic to use on the battle map, but if they are week, you could have none.\nI wish I could speak more on how well this game represent Warhammer, but I’ve never played Warhammer before. So I can’t speak on how well it keep to the lore and spirit of the franchise.\n\nNow I’ve only been talking about single player because I haven’t played multiplayer yet. But from what I saw it fairly basic. You got your custom matches, quick battles, and co-op campaigns. With all this new stuff that they added to the single player campaign, I would have expected some new to the multiplayer.\n\nAll it all, I found this a refreshing new entry in the Total War franchise. I know many people had technical problems at launch, but the only problem I had was a slight drop in frames. Once I change the setting to high from ultra and I’ve haven’t had an issue since (my specs: i7-4790, GTX 960, 8GB RAM). It’s kind a funny this game run better on my machine than Total War: Rome 2. I’ve had a lot of fun with this game, and can’t wait to playing this some more, especially with all the free DLC that CA announced for this game.","May 24","true","36.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This secured that flank. I had two regions fully controlled and fully upgraded, one for units the other for economy. I was making thousands a turn, while having access to all available units and fielding two, then three armies.\n\nSo, I'm growing, conquering, destroying. I attack the weak, the ones with only one or two settlements. I ignore the orcs which have a good chunk of the map, and an empire faction which also as a few cities and armies by me.\n\nI make another faction a vessel and let them grow since I start and end wars before they can mobilize. At this point I have 3 full high tier armies, one down south trying to find easy prey to conquer, two in my region keeping me safe.\n\nWhen bam, chaos comes along. I knew this would happen, but... I didn't realize how bad it would be. Chaos itself has four armies, each moving together, destroying everything. And the barbarian tribes are also moving hard, over a dozen armies between them.\n\nThey take my vessels second city, the one they got last turn, and four armies surround their capital the same turn. Over the next two turns I'm martialing my forces, pulling my third army back as fast as I can. My vessels armies get wiped out, but my banshee managed to destroy two full armies by successfully killing the lords leading them. Over the next few turns my vessel gets killed, and I can't help since my two armies would be fighting five armies from the barbarians, and four from chaos.\n\nSuddenly the gods decide to favor me, and the ever chosen is left behind, just out of range of range of the other chaos armies so I pounce, my lord attacks him, he retreats. My second lord attacks him, and together my armies destroy his without losing a single group. Great right? It gets better, the empire, which are friendly with me, get a few confederations and vessels that Same turn, and just in my region have three armies fighting the barbarian tribes.\n\nNext turn... Chaos reacts, two of their lords attack me, and I know if I retreat that will split my two armies apart. So, I fight. Two armies against two, mine have units going from nearly dead to a quarter health missing. I take out their artillery with my air units when their moving their armies to meet, fatal mistake for many of them. My calvalry engages theirs when I tried to flank. My armies are fighting their two lords, each of them flinging dozens of zombies and goals and skeletons a hit. But my armies were keeping their armies back at the same time, bam, the first enemy lord falls to the count leeching life from him in one massive spell. bam the second follows when my count slams into him with his undead flying horse, blade tearing through the massive birds skull. But what? Chaos refuses to give in! And so I battle and battle, doing everything I can to induce as much fear as I can, flanking to destroy moral even further. When their two giants come into the fray. My air units are harassing their units which were split apart, my two lords and my armies are fighting their giants with all they have. No more magic to use to heal or kill, low health on everything with the two giants only a quarter down. Enemy soldiers still coming, refusing to give up and retreat.\n\nI have two air units left, out of the original five, which included an undead dragon, my lords are both nearly dead, my armies are nearky broken, and the enemy still has those damned Giants. It was a loss, my fate had been sealed when their monstrous units entered the fray to help the Giants. But it was a close call, and it was one that bought me just enough time to survive as a faction. I didn't even get besieged.\n\nThe empire, my friends, are pushing back the barbarian tribes, and chaos was nice enough to free up some settlements to my north, my fate is not at an end, if anything, this defeat will bring me future glory.\n\n10/10, would die again.","May 28","true","25.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It has it's issues and bugs but compared to CAs other releases this thing is crazy stable. The quests, lore, factions and world design are amazing. The magic is bizzarly ballanced as some low tier magical crackle can rekt but a giant licking moon tickles the enemy, the foot of gork more like the slipper of nothingness anyway. The campaign design is solid yet as with most Total war games the challenge ends after about turn 120 plus, even with Chaos showing up with a few doom stacks your econmy is far too strong to really worry. The end of the campaign is really disapointing its just a screen and a well done. A cutscene or some video would have really made it so much better. The units are well desgined with a few balancing issues here and there. Hopefully some FLC with expand the factions also we all need squigs in a our lives.\n\nDon't buy if you have a toaster for a pc.

Overally game is a lot fun and definitely worth it.\n\nWhat I like about the game (pros):\n+ 5 currently playable races, all have their unique units, lords, tactics,technologies, playstyle,...\nTo expand on that - for example Greenskins (orcs) don't have flying units, however they have large variety of ground units to make up for it. Enough ranged / melee infantry or even cavalry units.\n+ Nice RPG system of levelling your lords / heroes, with equippable items providing another bonuses (weapon, armor,..) and with followers / banners to boost certain abilities. They also randomly get new traits, some are positive (aggresor), some are neutral (blind) and some are negative (dwarf lover)\n+ Story and quests both seem interesting\n+ Combat looks absolutely amazing, seeing your spider riders ran over enemy archers is one of the best sights you can have.\n\nThe things I don't enjoy (cons):\n- 'Scummy' AI as forum would say. They like to walk AROUND you, NOT engage a fight unless they have a big advantage and then proceed to sack and run before you can engage them. Sacking your settlement then changing to march to get as far as possible isn't exactly fun.\n- Difficulty jumps - if you are a new player, you will enjoy easy difficulty for some time but then you will want a bigger challenge than enemies forever waiting for you to destroy them. Normal on the other hand? 10th turn 2 enemy armies both with 20 units each on a journey to screw you over.\n- No Blood & Gore DLC yet (just a minor thing but it'd make the game so much more satisfying)\n- If you played other Total War games, you will notice there aren't formations in this one. I don't personally mind it as I am a casual strategy player, but for some it can be a flaw.\n\nThe things people like to talk about:\n* Artillery is way too accurate - not true. From what I've played artillery has big aoe where it shoots (you can see it when you order an attack), sometimes it misses, sometimes it hits. The radius of it is most likely based on the distance.\n* "Just 4 races" - There are 5 if you bought it already (counting Chaos) and all races are unique. It's not really 99% the same thing with a minor bonus to a unit type.\n* "Lords are way too strong" - yes and no, Lords are strong however if you manage to bring them down, you can easily win a fight where you are outnumbered because the enemy's leadership will significantly drop. IMO they are strong enough to warrant their upkeep","May 27","true","30.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Monsters like dragons and giants really add a lot to the battles to make them more exciting. More races will be added as DLC and I imagine, based on the current game, that will add a lot of replayability.\n\nThere are some things missing from previous games, like unit formations (wedges for cavalry!) Also, although the factions are very different from each other, there aren't that many in the core game... see DLC\n\nThere are a few bugs that need ironing out but when aren't there with a Total War game!

Units remain in formation unless they are devastated by cavalry,then their formation is broken and they can't reform IN COMBAT.That's a huge bonus.Flanking is actually possible now.\n\n-Optimization is 4x better than Attila.While I can barely run attila at 40 fps with the same tweaks,I get solid 60 fps in TWW.\n\n-Graphics are really good,even though I don't have shadows.Those unit models are awesome just to stare at.\n\n-Cavalry charges IMPROVED IMMENSELY.They actually WRECK infantry.I even saw a unit fly 10 meters away from his friends.\n\n-Legendary Lords are epic.They give you the "I'm more powerful than the rest" feeling.Watching Kholek smash infantry around him never gets old.\n\n-Magic is fun as hell.It is actually both fun,and extremely rewarding if you time your casts.Debuffs are a priority if your mainline is losing the combat.Debuff the enemy,voila ! Your line is not shaking anymore,go support them ! Lots and lots of new possibilities.\n\n-Campaing map is extremely detailed.There are random arachnarok spiders and stuff every now and then.\n\n-Random campaing events are fun to read.Like some random ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ nurgle warriors come and "bless" your warriors,resulting in -growth for your horde.\n\n-Voice acting is awesome\n\nCons :\n\n-Loading screens are 2x longer than Attila.You get bored while waiting.\n\n-High learning curve for new players.I lost 3 55-turn campaings because I was unfamiliar with the magic system.\n\n-Artillery shooting at the tree in front of them,resulting in their own crews dying.\n\n-Sieges are a bit harder for the attackers.They get cannons/arrows raining down on the right after starting the battle.\n\n-Game is A LOT more micro-intensive.\n\n\nIf you are a TW veteran,try this game out.\nIf you are a Warhammer fan,buy the game.You won't regret it.\n\n","May 24","true","99.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

It has it's issues and bugs but compared to CAs other releases this thing is crazy stable. The quests, lore, factions and world design are amazing. The magic is bizzarly ballanced as some low tier magical crackle can rekt but a giant licking moon tickles the enemy, the foot of gork more like the slipper of nothingness anyway. The campaign design is solid yet as with most Total war games the challenge ends after about turn 120 plus, even with Chaos showing up with a few doom stacks your econmy is far too strong to really worry. The end of the campaign is really disapointing its just a screen and a well done. A cutscene or some video would have really made it so much better. The units are well desgined with a few balancing issues here and there.

I wasn't interested.\n\nWhat ended up changing that opinion however, was a hands on playing both as the Empire vs Vampire Counts and Vampire Counts against Orcs at Rezzed. They were both set custom battles, but they demonstrated to me just how much effort was being put in to make the factions unique and different instead of just reskinned.\n\nNow, after playing nearly 24 hours of the final release I'm quite happy to say that it feels like the game is nicely optimized and mostly bug free though they need to do some work with Nvidia to work with their cards (Not that I'm suffering any graphical glitches. Running on a 980 gtx. I did see some oddities with V-sync enabled. Turned it off, and they went away. Not suffering due to it. Game looks beautiful). The factions, are utterly unique and play differently and just I can't express how much I've been enjoying it. It feels a lot more streamlined in terms of the building/politics in comparison to previous TWs but at the same time I almost feel like it helps the experience. It's a lot more aggressive, as fitting the universe, and this game has actually helped rekindle quite a lot of my faith in CA.\n\nI can only hope that future DLC is of the same standard, and done decently such as the fact Chaos Warriors are free for this first week, not just on preorder. If you're on the fence about it, I'd say jump in. Give it a try. It is a LOT of fun.","May 28","true","31.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Just one day after release i just played 24 hours. Best Total War of the Series and combined with Warhammer ... I love it pls more of it !! :D\n\nNow some Details to help the guys who are maybe undecided.\n\nWell i played every part since Medieval II Total war and i must say the new installment is refreshing und fun. A big beautiful and immersive map, all now 5 avaible races are fun and you can enjoy their differences in more than every other part of total war because their are now Humans, Dwarves,Orcs,Undead and the forces of Chaos.\n\nAlso i really love the Characte costumization !! Decide if your General/Commander rides a horse or goes on foot. Decide wich armor and weapons he wields.\n\nTo keep it short if you like strategy games go buy it. If you like warhammer go buy it. If you like the total war series go buy it.\n\nI´m really happy to say the game is worth every penny !\n\ngreetings from Germany\n\nand for Sigmar Heldenhammer !\nHave fun in the world of warhammer i look forward for expansions!\n\n(sorry for maybe bad english)","May 26","true","57.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

So when I booted this up I expected mabye 40 FPS on high. What I got though was around 50-60 fps on ultra.\n\nCampaign:  The campaign is great, you truly feel that every race is uniqe and they all play quite differently. As someone who usually played legendary on other TW games this one provided a new challenge to me and I had to bump it down to hard after my first few attempts as the greenskins.\n\nLarge Units/Magic:  These guys are amazing. It feels incredible to send in a giant spider as your line is crumbling or using your hero's flame spiral to destroy theirs. You can really feel they power of each spell, or eachstomp as they tear into the enemy.\n\nBattle:  The battles in TW W absolutely stun me. From towering giants to shambling zombies I feel like the devs had a dream, and they fulfilled that dream. Everything feels so well balanced and the units look amazing.\n\nLords:  Having quests and skill trees is really great. It makes everything feel very open ended and allows large amounts of replayability.\n\nThe Bad\nBugs:  Playing through the game your going to find bugs. Lots of them. Most of these will be fixed within a few weeks but it must be included. So far I haven't found any gamebreaking bugs but that doesn't mean they aren't there.\n\nPerformance (Again):  As said previously I have great performance. However loads of people are saying that they get terrible FPS so make sure to look into whether or not your comp can run it.\n\nMultiplayer  If its possible I think that the MP might have gotten worse since Attila. There are less options (Time of day, attacker direction, world map) and it crashes occasionally.\n\nAnd The Misc  Arcade  Now, I'm not saying that this is a bad thing, but it must be included that the battles are much faster then in any previous TW game.\n\nEconomy  Since Attila all aspects like food/sanitation have been removed. Personally I hated the way Attila handled it but for those who like managing cities I just wanted to let you know.\n\nDo you guys think I covered everything well? If not leave a comment and I will include it in the review.","May 25","true","132.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","3"

Though the recent installments in the TW series have left a sour taste in my mouth (Rome 2 and Attila to be exact) I remained hopeful that this would hark back to TW roots, and was not disappointed.\n\nThe factions are all vasty different, offering completely unique and diverse units to play around with. The mechanics that each faction have are different, ensuring that no play through shall ever be the same as another. While I dislike some of the mechanics (Orc Waaagh! for one) that is only down person playstyle.\n\nThe game itself is graphically beautiful, from campaign to battle map and unit models. Loading the AI turns, something that Rome 2 took way too long to do and Attila was awful for, is now almost instantaneous and back to Medieval 2's precedent. The fact that your heroes or "Lords" have a vast array of gear and options to take while levelling up can really change the tide of a battle, which I enjoy a lot more than a simple King/General with randomly generated stats and talents.\n\nOverall, I really feel this is a step in the right direction for the TW series and shows that they are able to step away from the historical based games and into fantasy very seamlessly, incorporating the new universe while keeping true to the game series' core mechanics. Very, very pleased.","May 29","true","25.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It really captures the whole over-blinged competency feel Fantasy and 40K have for themselves. (i.e. the more bling, the more badass your hero is.)\n\nThen we have the combat. Typical Total War, though oddly lacking formations like previous titles, such as Phalanx, Shield Wall and Wedge. But they added mod support, so I'll wait for an awesome modder to try and implement that. Kill animations are still great and the blood is decent. (DLC for that will come and I'll buy that on sale). Also seemingly lacks city and town fights. Really sad.\n\nDiplomacy. It's actually a whole lot better than in previous titles, which is great. Much easier to just slowly build your forces and economy, so once Chaos starts invading, EVERYONE is willing to put aside petty differences and join the Empire to fight the invasion. Not sure how it works for other factions, but I'll see later.\n\nBuilding and Economy. Not as indepth as Rome, Medieval and Shogun, about the same as Rome 2 and Attila. Everything has its place and if you want an economy churning out 10K gold and hundreds of soldiers each turn, you need to invest smartly.\n\nLeaders and Heroes. Great looking Legendary Heroes that only get 'wounded' when assassinated and much squishier, yet oh so awesome regular Heroes are found here. Legendary Heroes are the faction leaders and the side-characters. They're a little bit stronger than Heroes, but not OP. I've taken down each faction leader in direct mano-a-mano combat with a Hero of equal level. It all comes down to Skills, Items and Vassals. Correctly choosing the right stuff is something you have to pick up on; no guide yet. Heroes are more numerous and can make or break a battle. Either by slowing the army down or assassinating/wounding the leader on the World Map or taking to the field on the Battle Map, a Hero decides how a battle will be lost.\n\nOverall, its great so far, but we'll see how things go in the coming months.\n\nPROS so far:\n-Fantasy fans will appreciate the game. Too little Fantasy and too much 40K recently.\n-Factions are well done, plus free CHAOS DLC for preorders are great.\n-Unit models look great on even low settings.\n-Campaigns are just as great as previous titles but also have sidequests to gain awesome gear.\n-RPG-elements better integrated than previous titles.\n-Mod support\n-Mods already available, minutes after launch\n-Diplomacy done better, likely inspiration from modders of previous titles\n\nCONS so far:\n-Unit models aren't very diverse\n-AI Agents have higher success rate than player, as usual\n-Not bloody enough for a Warhammer title.\n-Not enough Hero diversity; same models with very simple variations.\n-No battle formations or tactics implemented, sadly.","May 25","true","31.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's a Total War game that has Warhammer in it.\n\nSo you've got magic units, a bit more customizability for agents/generals than in past titles, and they've added some flavor quests and faction specific mechanics to tie the game more closely to the setting. None of these things are bad, none of these dramatically shake up the genre or set a new benchmark for similar games, but TW: Warhammer is a fun TW game that is mostly evolutionary in nature.\n\nOverall I'd recommend it if you like the TW franchise.\n\nThat said, I have similar gripes about this one as previous installments:\n1. Even though it can take awhile to move around and such, the map still "feels" small. I always feel like things are a bit too scaled up. It doesn't really detract from gameplay, there is certainly a fair amount to do and every playthrough ends up being a bit different, but the feeling is always there nagging at me.\n\n2. So many locked factions.\n\n3. Empire management is simple and mostly just flavor between each of your battles. Given that Atilla and Rome 2 both had a bit deeper management layer (for some factions), it's kinda sad to see it simplified back down again. That said, if you mostly just want to play the battles, which are usually the high point of these games, this might not be that big a deal for you.","May 26","true","38.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Long time player of Total War, since the original Shogun and while I no longer play the tabletop games of Games Workshop I hugely enjoy the ridiculousness of the lore and setting.\n\nWith recent Games Workshop games often being so poor (Though there are exceptions) and having the debacle that was Rome 2 put me off the franchise enough to not even bother with Atila, if you'd asked me a while ago whether I was looking forward to this game the answer would have be no. I wasn't interested.\n\nWhat ended up changing that opinion however, was a hands on playing both as the Empire vs Vampire Counts and Vampire Counts against Orcs at Rezzed. They were both set custom battles, but they demonstrated to me just how much effort was being put in to make the factions unique and different instead of just reskinned.\n\nNow, after playing nearly 24 hours of the final release I'm quite happy to say that it feels like the game is nicely optimized and mostly bug free though they need to do some work with Nvidia to work with their cards (Not that I'm suffering any graphical glitches. Running on a 980 gtx. I did see some oddities with V-sync enabled. Turned it off, and they went away. Not suffering due to it. Game looks beautiful). The factions, are utterly unique and play differently and just I can't express how much I've been enjoying it. It feels a lot more streamlined in terms of the building/politics in comparison to previous TWs but at the same time I almost feel like it helps the experience. It's a lot more aggressive, as fitting the universe, and this game has actually helped rekindle quite a lot of my faith in CA.\n\nI can only hope that future DLC is of the same standard, and done decently such as the fact Chaos Warriors are free for this first week, not just on preorder. If you're on the fence about it, I'd say jump in. Give it a try. It is a LOT of fun.","May 28","true","31.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

What's new is that you are able to personalise them, obtaining mounts for them, items through quests and battles, bestowing titles unto them (only as The Empire Race), obtaining all kinds of banners and retainers of the like. Lords are important, as they are needed to muster your forces, and their abilties and even spells can be key to winning battle. Agents/Heroes Are also very important, if not more so now. In previous games, they were used for assasinations, spying, bullying armies, sabotage you name it. Now along with all that, they can also act as secondary lords in armies, with many sharing the same abilities of lords, they become very valuable. In Warhammer, lords are now a single but powerful units, with enough power to even slay monsters if strong enough.\n\nMonsters can vary in many different ways. There are single large powerful creatures able to kill a few men in one swipe. There are flying bats, armoured trolls, DRAGON OGRES??, Normal (sort of) dragons, poisonous hounds and even sp00ky ghosts.\n\nTotal War: Warhammer brings Warhammer fantasy into the our beloved total war, but just how much total war have they taken out and filled with fantasy? well.\n-While combat is really fun to take part of and is amazing to watch, it is also quite bland, your units have almost little to none abilties, or even lack any combat formation. No fire arrows, no Shield walls, no Phalanx, no Square Formation, Nothing.\n-No Kill moves\n-no proper tax control (since rome 2)\n-no ones eats in warhammer fantasy??\n-Races are restricted to occupying only members of the same race and their immediate opposing factions such as, empire and vampires and orcs and dwarves (chaos being a horde races)\n-Vampires literally have no ranged units, and Chaos hardly show any.\n-The empire seem to be a powerhouse yielding most unit types (so much siege as well), making it seem unbalanced for other races.\n-Literally No Navel.\n-few races lack diplomatic options\n\nHowever that doesn't mean this is a bad game, for what seems to be so many things missing in this game, there's a lot that makes up for it.\n-The Rpg element into lords and heroes.\n-MAGIC\n-The graphics are nice with optimization being okay done, furthure updates hopefully fix for others\n-Each race has various things that are unique to them, such as the Orc's Waaagghh, the vampires ability to raise the dead and even corrupt nearby provinces(also with Chaos).\n-The quest battles are exciting for legendary lords and also rewarding.\n-voices are nicely done\n-design gone into the units and even especially that of the lords and bigger creatures are very pleasing.\n-The Ai have definiately stepped up their game, a much bigger improvement from previous titles (although diplomacy can vary, but still).\n-siege is less messy and all over the places, more simplified\n-nice introduction for the normal factions, making it easier on new players.\n-units are much easier to understand, making it easier to use them.\n-Mod Support\n\nThank you Creative Assembly.\nThank you Sega.\nKeep up the good work.\n\n\n\n\n\n","May 30","true","75.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

This kept the core of what total war is, it gives us a good taste of the warhammer world with lots of concepts from the world well executed in gameplay. I've had a few tiny bugs, nothing big so far. The magic is definetely a big part of the battle, but does seem to be balanced quite well.\nI've played mostly just the campaigns at this point. As with most total war, the story aspects are limited, the story missions are a lot of fun, but I haven't completed all of them even in the campaign I completed. So far all the factions I've played are a lot of fun. I look forward to playing this for a long time.","June 1","true","111.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I never really played the older titles more than once, but this game got me playing it through 5 times. The races play differently on the campainmap as well as in the battles.\n\nMost of the issues can be modded away with the workshop that really starts to fill up.","June 1","true","80.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
