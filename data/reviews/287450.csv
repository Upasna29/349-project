Its easy to pick up and difficult to put down.\n\nThis game only came on Steam a year or so ago. We played the retail release. This new version adds Twitch support and is a lot more friendly to modern systems and resolutions. I've not clocked long on it mainly due to the bitter sweet memories. I like the units in this game.

I love it as it consists of gameplay of all eras. Starting with your slignshots and swords, and improving until you get missiles and stealth bombers.\n\nIt's story is quite good and reminds you of the glory days with some great battle. Multiplayer is one of its best elements. Playing with your friends co-op versus with AI or just an all out battle! Customise the teams as you want and also the battle's options like map size, technologies and winning methods.\n\nNow let's talk about Extended Edition. <---Skip here if you just want to learn the differences.\nThe game graphics look quite similar but definitelly smoother. You can feel the overall gameplay and animations of the charaters being so smooth while moving and fighting.\n\nMultiplayer is here once again with leaderboards! As gamespy is dying the game now has multiplayer once again and better than ever! I am hoping to see an ever bigger map though and more units instead of just 200/300. I bet it wouldn't be much of a problem nowadays with the new updated and powerful computers.\n\nTwitch! Do you like streaming and showing off your gameplay? This will be very handy for you. Log in, hit the record button and show your fans all your strategy tactics on how you beat your opponent!\n\nThe only downside for me is that the game looks quite similar, yet some small very handy improvements will make it quite better.\n\nBigger maps, yes bigger than Big Huge. People using the editor can remake their countries and some of their battles with a proper big terrain.\n\nMore units! Setting the unit price to lower and having more units in battle will totally increase the fun of the game.\n\nMore players? With bigger maps, more players can be added as well. 12 or something like that.\n\nOverall?\nIf you liked the original, you are gonna like this one as well.\nIf you haven't played the original, then if you like real time strategy games, you are gonna love it too!","June 11, 2014","true","16.7"," 369 of 409 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","369","409","0","2"

I was doing building of many types of units which have their own abilities and specialties. The number of research that I could do was mind boggling and are very effective while winning a game. This game , to me, redefined the genre RTS. So without any further delay let me review this game quickly....\n\nGame Play :\nAs anyone can understand the game play is fairly complex due to number of different units , number of different resources and the number of different buildings with different research items. But RTS is all about complexity. You build up your game slowly and nicely (the way you see it fit the objective) and then in a single master stroke your complete your objective(s). Most of the missions are timed which means that you have to achieve victory within a stipulated amount of  real time (say 90 minutes). Usually I find this time to be more than enough but at time to time (specially with rising difficulties) you may find it a bit more challenging.\n\nIn SINGLE PLAYER Campaign you can play different scenarios (more in number in extended edition) or you can play the age old classical world domination. MP is also there and somewhat active in nature - but you must play good and I mean REAL GOOD to win MPs. The statistics from the game engine that comes out after the game is pretty impressive, you could even get a stats about your right and left clicks in the entire game as well....\n\nGraphics:\nEven if the game is from 2004 the graphics is stunningly detailed. If you zoom a bit you can see - the seas are having waves , the crops in the farms are swinging with the wind current and what not. From RTS perspective the details is very high (some people may not say its good but I actually liked it). The different models have their different behaviors.\n\nOver all this detailed graphics adds a nice touch to the entire gaming experience.\n\nControls:\n\nControls are fairly easy to understand and its better to have the shortcut keys known to yourself - they will help you greatly in the MPs. mouse clicks are pretty consistent but in my slower GPU the scroll rate for the map was a bit jaggy.\n\nFor a comprehensive basic guide I recommend   this. .\n\nMisc:\n\nIn other features - the game now have integrated Steamplay, Twitch,  Steam Achievements and Steam Trading Cards to increase the game experience even more. The Extended Edition also includes the Thrones and Patriots expansion , the HD models.\nOverall the game gets a thumbs up from me.\n\nHope you will enjoy the game as I did.\n\n~ Conqueror of the world ~","October 28, 2014","true","8.3"," 65 of 73 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","65","73","0","0"

It's customizable enough so that a newcomer or veteran who would rather not worry about tech, econ, or combat can disable those elements in the starting menus.\n\nThere are six economic resources in the game (three of which appear after appropriate research). Most combat units, buildings, tech, and upgrades cost one or two types of resources. They also tend to increase in cost the more of the same unit/building you have already built, which encourages players to diversify their buildings and units rather than just rebuild one type over and over.\n\nCombat units usually adhere to a rock/paper/scissors balance mechanic, although at later ages there are a decent range of specialized units that accomplish unique functions in warfare. Controlling a battle group is relatively intuitive - command buttons on the console also show shortcuts for the more-familiar player, and extra modifiers such as facing, General craft powers, and terrain also allow modest benefits for the detail-oriented player.\n\nEach nation has its own special powers, which lead to interesting matchups (although at higher levels of play, certain nation powers mandate a narrower choice of strategy than others).\n\nThose already experienced with RTSes can expect to jump right in and get playing against the AI competitively, and then jump online to test their skills against humans. This game may be a steeper learning curve for newcomers to the RTS genre because of its breadth of econ, tech, and military.\n\nPlayers who like modding their games will also find this game rewarding and versatile, including the ability to mod entire campaigns and to create new units in the game's .xml files.\n\nAn excellent balance of accessibility and complexity.

It's a perfected version of Rise of Nations and Rise of Nations: Thrones and Patriots, all with new Steam features like achievements, cloud saving and more.\n\nLike many Microsoft games remake, Rise of Nations: Extended Edition retain exactly the very same gameplay and features from the previous 2 games, everything combined into a single game. If only like Age of Empires 2: HD Edition, the population limit is increased, this game might worth more. At least we get to see the old Conquer the World campaign along with the Thrones and Patriots new campaign such as the Cold War. For you who haven't play Rise of Nations before, the gameplay of this game is very good, start with a single city, build a library, college, market and expand your city, then build more cities and expand your empire into a great nation. Victory can be achieved through conquest, science or in this game called tech race, building wonders and there are more win condition for custom play.\n\nRise of Nations: Extended Edition graphics are, well, it's said that the water and textures has been improved, and there is a new anti-aliasing effect, but me personally didn't see that great differences from the previous Rise of Nations, or maybe it's just been far too long. The graphics are classic, but good, very good, I'm not saying it's bad, it's just kinda still old. The performances are good, no lags or any kind of problems.\n\nRise of Nations: Extended Edition however, have many room for improvements, if Microsoft really care. Maybe a DLC? Bad idea for most but at least there is an addition, maybe new unique units, new unique unit models for each nation (seriously, Russian launching F-18 Hornet from their carrier?), new campaign maybe the Roman campaign or something, even maybe new nation? Expansion Packs?\n\nLike many other too, Rise of Nations: Extended Edition has the Steam workshop support for community made custom content like maps, scenarios, even mods.\n\nBut overall, Rise of Nations: Extended Edition is a great game, very fun and with the new Steam features, even better. I recommend this.\n\nRating 9/10","November 25, 2014","true","50.1"," 46 of 54 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","46","54","0","1"

(well one, Nemesis of the Roman Empire, but that was way back then)\n\nI've played Civilization V and probably some other Civilization when I was younger but I forgot which one it was. :P Anyways, this game is almost PERFECT for me. Almost because they could add some small features here and there, but it's not a big deal. The only bad thing that has yet to happen was my laptop shutting down mid-game, but I think it over heated haha.\n\nWhat is this game like? If RIsk and Civilization were to become RTS games and have a potato, this would be that potato. If Windows 95 became a RTS I would eat that potato. Potatos are good for your health. Thank you based potato. Great game don't see why you shouldn't buy it. Multiplayer has ranked matches, even a lobby chat on the game browser. It's pretty active if you're a multiplayer type of person.\n\nThank you based Microsoft.","November 20, 2014","true","66.2"," 46 of 55 people (84%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","84","46","55","23","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/velmarg/recommended/287450/","velmarg","Velmarg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/velmarg/","148 products in account","The question on most of the minds of people who played this game:\n\nDoes it hold up?\n\nYes.\n\nUnlike Age of Empires II which, in my opinion, sadly doesn't stand the test of time, Rise of Nations is every bit as fun and engaging as it was more than ten years ago. It's also still a bit of a mess in its late game moments, which I'll address a bit later.\n\nFirst off, for any new players donning their commander cap for the first time, what is Rise of Nations? It's best described, I think, as a cross between Age of Empires and Civilization. It is a real-time strategy game, first and foremost - worker units are recruited and instructed to gather the expected resources in food, wood, gold, iron, and later oil. They'll also construct military barracks, universities for gaining knowledge (which you'll spend to research technologies and advance through the ages), castles and forts for locking down territory, and perhaps most importantly of all - cities.\n\nYou'll begin the match with one city. Structures like temples and forts will push your borders out a bit for you, but the only way to really expand your territory effectively is to build new cities. You can then recruit from your new city more villagers, which will proceed to build all the same farms, temples, lumber mills and schools you constructed at your first city - and eventually, you'll start the whole process over again. There's a great sense of satisfaction in watching each of your cities grow from a humble huddle of townhouses to its full sprawl of market, temple, barracks, school and more.\n\nCities, as I mentioned, expand your borders, which are important primarily due to unit attrition. You can move your workers and military units within your own territory unfettered... but set foot on enemy lands, and you'll notice a red glow pulsing at their feet and a health bar that will slowly begin to dwindle. Supply wagons can be built, and as long as your units are within its effective range, they can pass into enemy lands without fear of damage. Should your wagon(s) be destroyed by the enemy, your units will immediately begin taking damage over time. In this sytem of attrition and supply, Rise of Nations creates a very unique combat game that can force the retreat of a march larger force or encourage players to slug it out along borders where they can effectively fight without fear of attrition.\n\nAs stated above, you'll progress from the sticks and stones of the ancient world on through the crossbows and knights of the middle ages - the tanks and bombers of the World War II-era modern age, ending finally in the information age, where stealth bombers and ICBMs run amok. It's exciting and interesting to see what units will open up to you in each era, and every civilization has several unique units available to it throughout time that inject enough variety to encourance players to give them all a try.\n\nAs I also stated above, the end-game of Rise of Nations is definitely its greatest weakness. One would expect the introduction of fighter jets, bombers, nuclear warheads and rocket artillery to be pretty exciting, right? Well, it mostly ends up creating a huge mess of a battlefield where's it's almost impossible to keep track of what's going on, who's killing who, or what's best effective against what. As nuclear warheads begin to drop and level cities, and certain technologies completely remove the wait time for recruitment (meaning you can keep clicking the "Rocket Artillery" icon and it will keep building them click after click after click instantly), the game loses any sense of cohesion and almost feels like a test of who can control complete and utter chaos.\n\nLuckily, the custom options in the game allow you to not only set a limit on how far the game can progress (IE: you can stop all further advancement at the Gunpower Age, so no one can build anything more advanced than a musket), but also how quickly you can advance. At the slowest settings, you'll likely be able to fight several battles with each age's loadout of units - though you'll also be waiting around quite a bit longer for your research to complete.\n\nOverall, I'm happy to report that Rise of Nations is still a whole lot of fun. It lacks the depth of a game like Civilization V, and the combat will feel pretty basic compared to more tenacious RTS fare Starcraft II and Company of Heroes 2 - but there's really something to be said for a game that can marry the territorial expansion and slog through time of the Civilization with more bread and butter RTS mechanics. It you enjoy strategy games, it's a steal at $20.","June 13, 2014","true","8.1"," 34 of 45 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","34","45","0","4"

The gameplay itself is still very challenging and complex, especially managing the resources and multi-tasking armies, like most other RTS games.\n\nRise of Nations won many awards and presents execellent gameplay strategy and tactics due to it's realistic resource/market system. There's not many things that bring me more satisfaction than managing to get my resources going really well, and building up huge armies to invade enemy lands. The game itself is very complex, and with higher difficulties vsing the computer, it becomes very hard to win. The online in this game isn't very great, so I'd suggest playing 2v2 with bots when playing this game. Although you might think you'd feel like a loner, you definetely won't when you're managing an entire country, negotiating with your ally and crushing the enemies.\n\nThe five main campaigns in this game is also superb. You could play as Napoleon, conquering europe by playing very fun and interesting scenarios, such as when you gain a few armies to invade a whole heavily guarded Egypt (10/10 historical). The graphics aren't that bad either, considering that I'm very picky on graphics. There are over 40~ countries to play as in Rise of Nations, each of them with their own set of unique powers and units.\n\nOverall, this game still remains a great RTS, with challenging and rewarding gameplay. There's no better feeling than managing to take over two countries via a huge campaign of sieging while the AI on your team does nothing but take the brunt of the enemy's force.","December 15, 2014","true","48.7"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","20","21","0","0"

One day as I was browsing through the store of steam I was thinking to myself about life and the meaning of it when all of the sudden I saw this game. An unknown force took control of me as I clicked to purchase this game, and procceded to type my debit card information and part of my soul into the computer. Once the sacrifice had been completed I joyfully clicked the library button to download my new game, but I stared in tremendous horror as the download button was missing. I searched through the darkest points of the internet to find a cause to this nightmare to find that the game was to come out later this month. Throughout the month I've been preparing for the coming of this game, by sacrificing goats to the Microsoft gods, so when the game came out they would already be pleased with my actions. My parents took notice of this and sent me to therapy, saying I had a problem and that I needed "Help" but I knew that they were blind to the greatness this game would bring. Finally the day came for me to finally download the game I awoke at 4 A.M. to download the masterpiece Microsoft presented, and as I clicked the download button tears started to well up in my eyes as I saw the yellow numbers increasing until it reached 100%. When I saw the game perform first time set-up I knew that the game would be amazing for it had to be, so many goats, and rabbits had been put to rest for this cause. The game booted up and it was at that moment I knew the answer to my first question, the meaning of life is to play this game. So now I sit in the basement playing this game. I haven't slept or eaten for 5 days for food and rest is just a sorry excuse to leave this game. I write this review to tell people that we have been blessed by the gods of Microsoft and that when the apocolypse begins only those who played this game will survive.","June 12, 2014","true","11.7"," 51 of 75 people (68%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","68","51","75","4","1"

It is, naturally, better with friends - as most things are, except perhaps murder. Multiplayer on this game, especially with a tight group of close friends with whom you can have plenty of banter, just about beats every other RTS hands down. The thrill of armed combat across an enormous map (or Big Huge map as the game calls it) is gripping, and the delicate but simple mechanics of the Rise of Nations economy, and the associated feeling of a build up towards "greater things" (the Modern Age, where my favourite nation, Germany, receives all of its major bonuses) only intensifies.\n\nThe game has a population cap of 250, which isn't acceptable in this day and age when most people posess relatively decent PCs can thusly run the game on much better graphics. In the community guides you'll find easy, quick techniques which will allow you and your friends to up the pop cap to 1,000. I highly recommend this - if you wish to play with up to 8 friends, all of whom you know, not only does it increase the enjoyment of the game but prevents any "ganking". If you have: 1. a superb economy, 2. the will to fight two enemies at once, 3. the micromanaging powers to maintain your homefront during any fight, you may well win! Being able to balance out an optimal amount of over 750 units (not including your civilian population, depending on how large it is) across the map, as well as being able to cover your frontiers, makes for an interesting as well as much more enjoyable game.\n\nTL;DR, this game is fun.

It is a gem of the strategy genre that many are yet to experience, and should soon.\n\nDifficult to point out special virtues in RoN. Perhaps the 18 technologically and aesthetically delineated civilisations, or the fast-paced urban improvements and clever use of the Academy as the core of a settlement's upgrades. Perhaps the military attrition that has just the right rhythm, allowing both the player and their opponents to constantly and progressively advance in warfare capacity and strength, and in a match each invasion feels like a whole new emotion - much harder to bring down an adversary in one shot here.\n\nIt is also commendable the way BH Games found to display a balanced, yet challenging temporal advancement system that takes you from the classic age to contemporary conflicts and geopolitics. You improve your technologies and expand your settlement across the neighbouring territories (and yes, the territories are another exciting feature in RoN) as you are justly rewarded with the chance of gripping at the next moment in human progress. I've seen few strategy games in which age advance is so balanced and perceptible through the player's actions and upgrade management (a system very similar to Empire Earth II, by the way).\n\nThe Extended Edition looks fresh, especially visually. However, and this could be something particular to my system – I’m yet to find out –, the buildings and upgrades icons are missing, and I hope a future update shall remedy this little issue (edit: it is apparently a first-launch issue; for those having the same problem, just quit and restart the game, and all icons should be back on). Apart from that, looks like good old RoN to me thus far.\n\nRise of Nations can snatch many an hour out of your weeks, a strategy masterpiece with which I have a history, not in vain, since its replayability factor is always able to drag me back to it and renew that history bringing to it more pleasurable gaming experiences. Besides, I can finally say that Steam has come miles closer to bringing all my dream games to its repertoire.","June 13, 2014","true","20.1"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/biz_/recommended/287450/","biz_","Biz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/biz_/","232 products in account","Rise of Nations is one of the only RTS games that puts strategy ahead of micromanagement. The design was extremely innovative when the game came out in 2003, and nothing since then has even come close.\n\nIt takes the pacing and tactics of games like Age of Empires and Starcraft and combines them with the depth and strategy of games like Civilization. The result is something truly awesome.\n\nThere are a lot of different ways to customize games, so each player can set up games to suit his or her style of play.\n\nThe competitive play is very rewarding and challenging and really puts an emphasis on strategic decision-making. The balance isn't perfect, but the game has random maps that are different every time so that players are forced to adapt instead of memorizing build orders.\n\nPlaying casually is also rewarding and fun. Unlike other multiplayer RTS games that can feel like hard work instead of enjoyable entertainment, Rise of Nations doesn't require constant attention and giving orders all over the map at insane speeds (although you can control  your units like that if you want to). It's the ideal RTS for people who don't have the speed, energy, focus, and free time of teenagers.\n\nMost RTS games are a miserable experience unless the matchmaking is perfect and opponents are very close in skill level. Rise of Nations is different. The design of the game and the different modes ensure that fun and exciting games are commonplace instead of being a rare event.\n\nThe game has an extensive tech tree and lots of depth, but the learning curve is excellent as it lets you gradually discover what you need to know. There are lots of different civilizations with unique abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. All of this makes the balance less than ideal, but it ensures that the game doesn't get stale or repetitive, even after thousands of hours of play.\n\nRise of Nations represents the best strategy gameplay in the RTS genre. It's not a perfect game, but it comes closer than anything else. It's entirely possible that we will never see a game quite like this again. If you are a fan of actual strategy in games, you'll want to experience this gem while it still has a player base.","June 13, 2014","true","12.8"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

To date, no RTS game has surpassed Rise of Nations in how well it has incorporated typical mechanics/features of 4X/turn-based strategy games. Rise of Nations features many unique factions, procedurally generated maps, 8 ages (many more than Age of Empires), MANY creatively implemented mechanics, naval warfare, and much more.\n\nThe game is extremely fun to play with friends. If you have friends that play Civ or other strategy games, Rise of Nations: EE is a great game to add to your repertoire of games. For single player, I have not seen a better AI. This is not to say it is perfect, but only few can hold a candle to RoN AI.\n\nThis is a game that is truly excellent and reigns as king in its game design. I've played many RTS games including the Warcraft series, Starcraft BW, CNC series, Company of Heroes, Age of Empires series, Kohan series, Total Annihilation, and an assortment of 4X/turn-based strategy games.

Legends was done a lot better in my opinion but came at a later date.\n\nNone the less though expect a European Wars Cossacks style of play. The only difference here is you cannot build wherever you'd like. The campaign plays as so : you are given the choice of scenarios or are allowed to choose your own map to conquer (I chose the world map to conquer). You have different races to choose from with each their own tactical ability. What separates this game and what I like about it is that the more research you do, the more you are allowed to build (no duh right), but you are allowed to build cities a certain distance away from one another and establish trade routes. Serfs are needed to harvest food (5 farms per city), or can be told to gather wood (need to build a wood cutting camp), and iron and oil can respectively be collected. Buildings such as lumberyards are available to make your lumber gather skills better (likewise for food and iron).\n\nThe fighting is an RPG style of play and the formations the units line up in are awesome. Preparing your units for battle and lining them up accordingly and to which angle is made beautifully. They followed the idea of Knights and Merchants when it came to telling units in which direction to point - except this one does a better job of it.\n\nAfter a fight (or before a fight) you have an overview of your world map and from here can use strategic cards to your advantage or tell units where to move. You may also upgrade your current country's wealth.\n\nBack in the day this game would have received a higher rating from me, but as we are living in the present day and have quite the variety of games I will have to give it a 7.6/10. It has a fun factor, but it's re playability is sporadic.

Although it isn't as comprehensive as the technology tree of Civilization III, Rise of Nations' research fields are still broader than those of just about any other real-time strategy game yet. There are four main areas of research: military, civil, commerce, and science. Each area has eight levels, as well as a top-level technology for each area once you reach the eighth stage. However, each of these technologies is balanced fairly well against the others, so you're free to choose the technological path you most prefer without worrying that your unbalanced research might leave you vulnerable in some way. Additionally, you'll conduct most of your research in a single building: the library. The consolidation of most of the game's technology under one roof is a breakthrough in logistics--you no longer have to go hunting for different buildings to conduct research.\n\nLike Age of Empires, Rise of Nations features eight different ages: classical, medieval, gunpowder, enlightenment, industrial, modern, and information. Even though game's timeline begins in the Dark Ages and ends in a futuristic era, it manages to strike a perfect balance between the different ages and the breadth of technologies available in each. And despite all that depth, Rise of Nations is paced well and isn't overly complex--the game's interface makes it easy to understand what you need to do to advance to the next age, and the resource costs of advancement are challenging to meet without being ridiculously expensive.\n\nThe only really serious complaint that hard-core strategy fans could level at Rise of Nations is that the game doesn't have a story-based campaign like so many other recent real-time strategy games. Instead, Rise of Nations features a single-player "conquer the world" campaign in which the world is divided into sections, like in the classic board game Risk. You start out as one nation on this map and attempt to literally conquer every other country in the world. Controlling your nation on the world map is turn-based, but when you enter into territory you don't control, the game changes to real-time mode. Interestingly, the campaign offers different scenarios for different territories. In one territory, your mission might be to withstand a barbarian raid for 30 minutes. In another, it might be to race across a map to destroy a barbarian encampment. In a contested territory, you might have a normal conquest game in which you must eliminate the enemy. Capturing and holding additional territories gives you benefits, such as an extra army or resource bonuses you can take with you into every tactical battle. However, this campaign, which is really just a glorified version of Risk, isn't as developed as the actual real-time game. Still, it's enjoyable, if a bit simple, and it adds a substantial single-player component to the game.\n","January 31","true","391.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

I may not have many hours this far on RON. I just purchased it on steam but I've had it for years on CD. Therefore few hours in steam.\n\nRise of Nations is a real-time strategy game. You start off in Ancient age where you build yourself some farms and gather wood for future uppgrades.\nThis game is all about uppgrading from Ancient age into the much familiar Modern age, and ofcourse the more you uppgrade ages the better your units and overall income will be.\n\nIn RON you have " territory " being the area around your camp/settlement. You are limited to this area and can only build in this area. One exception being the small city ( a new city ).\nYou can expand your territory by building a new city somewhere close to your current one.\nHaving more cities will allow you to maintain some gold income and start the trading business.\nThere are also limits to how many farms, scholars, and trade caravans you can have each city. Therefore expanding is a must.\nI want to add that in normal mode the game has a sudden death mode. If a player reaches a goal in territory. Having an extreme lead in territory percentage, that player will win in 4 minutes.\n\nThere are ofcourse several ways and modes to play in RON. You can choose wether you want a fast game where you get resources faster and you rush the enemy, you can choose economic game where you gather lots of resources before the big battle, sudden death by wonders and many more.\n\nIn RON you build wonders. Like the great pyramide and statues. Theese wonders will grant you benefits like more income from mining, lumber, higher population limits.\n\nWhat I like about Rise of Nations would be the evolving battles. At first you start off with a handfull of men throwing rocks, using bows and spears. Then after a little while you get horses, catapults and attack ships.\nYou uppgrade and suddenly you have riflement, tanks, battleships and airplanes.\n\nThe huge battle after you have found oil and starting to build nuclear weapons and bomb planes. Having units with flamethrowers and bazookas. The feeling when your gigantic formation of soldiers  destroys the enemy city and you claim that city as your own.\n\nRise Of Nations is inexpensive and fun to play. The best strategy game I've come across this far.\nI would recommend this game to anyone being a fan of strategy games!","December 31, 2015","true","13.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","2"

As soon as you ask for updates because the problems with the sound, music and multiplayer still exists - no answer. The publisher/developer is answering in the forums but only to unimportant stuff. This is a shame and a no go!\nThis makes me sad because they re-released some games already which have not been sentenced to capital punishment. Age of Empires 2 HD e.g. or Age of Mythology. I see work from the developers there. Why not in this game?\n\nIf those annoying errors won't exist this would be definitely a recommandation.","June 14, 2015","false","52.3"," 105 of 194 people (54%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","54","105","194","17","12"

For 10 years this has been the high-water-mark of the genre, and most of us who had it on day 1 are veteran players of those 10 years. For those of you who don't know (and I guess that's why you're reading this after all) Imagine if Total War had a lovechild with Age of Empires. There's a turn-based global map where your civilization expands and fights on their way to world domination, and each turn there are battles for the territory you wish to gain or hold.\nEach nation has an innate advantage, and with the building of world wonders on the global map, can be enhanced further, while resources from captured territory are available in later battles too. All of this might make you think that the RTS part is less vital, but in fact the action is just as hot down there. A wide range of units and technologies in each historical period are on hand to take down enemy settlements, and a variety of defensive structures to hold them off.\nOn a downside, there are a number of known bugs right now, but the devs are releasing regular patches to deal with those.","June 19, 2014","true","9.2"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

Even though I played a LOT of different games during my time playing Rise of Nations, I always spent some time playing this game. I am no expert even though I spent hundreds of hours playing this game, since I only play games for fun, not to be a master at it. I did use the cheats for fun (cheat nuke on Classical age LOL) and it results to my lack of the skill to play the game. So pardon my incapability to speak about the technical details of the game.\n\nThe reason I spent so much time fooling around back then rather than seriously trying to master the game was because the fact that Rise of Nations is very fun to mess around with. You have a sandbox mode where you can pretty much create any scenario you want or make any kind of battles. The built-in cheats are also very fun to play with. I play games for fun, not to win.\n\nNow about the game type, Rise of Nations is a classic old RTS game. You gather resources, build buildings & upgrades, build an army, attack your enemy and destroy their cities. It's just like Warcraft III's multiplayer (not dota, dota is a mod), Age of Empire, Stronghold Crusader, StarCraft, etc. These kind of games had its golden age back in early 2000s. Now, it's mostly dominated by Total War series, which are way more complicated and detailed since it's more focused on realism and strategy rather than the old RTS games, which are focused on the balance between building and combat. Old RTS games tend to be much more simpler due to limited technology at that time + they must have doubt people will like complex realistic strategy game, until Total War showed its success with Total War Medieval. Rise of Nations started to implement some complexity in-game by giving the effects of the terrain on the unit's performance, attritions, upgrades, more resources types, etc rather than a simple build-and-attack RTS game, but its gameplay is still kept simple and easy to learn.\n\nRise of Nations offers a lot of choices in the game by giving you a lot of nations, ages, game mode and maps to choose. You can fight on air, sea, and land with a lot of unit types. Each nation has their own unique units, which are usually the iconic units of the country (e.g British's Scottish Highlander, US's Continental Marines, Russia's T-80 tank, German's Tiger Tank, etc). The ages is a really good system that rarely got implemented in other RTS games. I only know Age of Empire also implemented this but it was very limited, and Empire Earth, just like RIse of Nations also implemented a large amount of choices for ages. Each ages has their own unique strategy and play style, offering way more variety to the gameplay.\n\nThe game itself is without question, heavily unbalanced. For example, Chinese's ability to instantly generate citizens itself is already very OP, allowing rapid constructions all over the territory and rapid resource gathering. I doubt the devs will do anything about this in the future since there are A LOT of elements in the game that are tied to one another but it's still definitely fun to play. If you're looking for a simple, fun, and easy to learn RTS games, Rise of Nations is definitely a good choice. You can also check out Empire Earth if you don't mind ugly graphics and small unit count for the same amount of fun. Rise of Nations is like the upgraded version of Empire Earth, it looks much better and the gameplay is much better too.\n\nTL;DR It's simple, has a very large variety of gameplay, very easy to learn but hard to master, mediocre but acceptable graphics and animations (it's a 2003 game give it a break), and super fun gameplay.","January 8","true","6.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

My adventures with RoN started back about 6 years ago. It was one of those games I'd go back to year after year, I managed to get several friends in the meantime hooked on the game. It was contagious, as they'd occasionaly let their friends in on it. However, many of us had to rely on Gameranger for it to work, as not only was Gamespy a POS, different versions of the game didn't work with eachother correctly. For example, buying the gold version which was the normal game and its expansion didn't work with someone who had the expansion but didn't get it via gold version. So multiplayer was a weird hassle on this, and difficult to acquire legally. Then it showed up on Steam, answering all these problems.\n\nIt's an amazing RTS, and has some elements of Civ V that aren't really seen in other RTS games.

The interface is fantastic, it's easy to switch between controlling units and upgrading your economy, there's little to no "busywork", and you can slow time down to something glacial enough that even elderly gamers like myself can handle it. It's an RTS that's fun for people who generally prefer TBS, in other words. I played an absolute ton of this in single player back in the day and always thought it would be great for multiplayer, but I never got the chance to try it. Now it's going to happen. Can't wait!

Instead I will focus entirely on what this Extended Edition brings to the table, and if the promoted features are of any importance to you: the consumer. So let's go.\n\nRise of Nations: Extended Edition is a re-release of the classic RTS from Big Huge Games. But rather than just slapping a "Works on Windows 8" sticker on the packaging and calling it a day, the developer of this "Extended" edition decided to get creative and add some improvements on the original game. That's a fine idea in of itself. It's an older game, and can't quite compete with modern games from the genre. But was it necessary, and did it actually add anything of value to the game?\n\nNo. In short, no, absolutely not. The visual improvement added to the game were - in no way - a neccessity. In fact, I'd go as far as saying that they lower the value of the product. The enhancements include (but are not limited to): Faster animations for units, new smooth shadow effect for 3D models, blown out brightness, colours and contrast in menus, animated backgrounds replaced with static images, a subtle bloom effect, and "terrain depth".\n\nWhat does any of this mean? The game looks, and feels, very different from the game you remember. And no, it's not just from my rose-tinted glasses. Boot up the original game and have a look for yourself, the original - unextended - still works just fine, and then compare it with some images from this one. The EE looks... cheaper. I can't say I care much about the menu being broken, but the ingame improvements takes a bit getting used to. Luckily a few of them can be turned off, but many cannot be changed back.\n\nHowever. Having said that. It still plays the same as it always did, and that's really all we should care about. Yes, the changes are weird, useless, and somewhat overpriced, but it's still RISE OF NATIONS on Steam! With gamespy-free multiplayer! And workshop support! (And built-in streaming through Twitch, if you're into that sort of thing). So in the end, this "Extended" game is worth it - if you want it to be. No more CDs. No more multiplayer through Hamachi. No more ini-tweaks for higher resolutions. Just press Play and go.","June 12, 2014","true","32.5"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

Sure, a lot of this may be nostalgia, but RoN has a lot of refined RTS mechanics. All resources are renewable, so you don't end up mining all the gold and stone while chopping down every tree on the map that late game Age of Empires can turn into. The UI is amazing (top left corner tells you the income rate for each resource) and the control group system is better than any other RTS out there. You can set a unit to be the waypoint of buildingss, and newly created units will join the control group(s) of that waypoint unit.\n\nThe attrition/border system, the wonders, and the fact that the time frame of RoN spans from the Stone Age to the Information Age will make RoN feel like a Civilization game in RTS form, and that's definitely not a bad thing.

Each nation has its strengths and weaknesses, the goal is build your strengths and hide your weaknesses. For example, letting the British bomb you with their lancaster bombers is a terrible idea, but their groud forces are no match to the Americans. It's a diverse balancing game which works extremely well.\n\nThrougought the years I played the game, I hadn't played one multiplayer game, it was all spent in conquer the world, which is an incredibly fun game mode. You take control of a nation, and your goal is conquer.. Well.. The world. There are several different scenarios you can play though, including the reign of Alexander the Great and conquering the Americas as the Spanish.\n\nI touched on the multiplayer, it needs signficant improvement, although that was to be expected with such a game. The game starts to flicker at 1920x1080, although that's likely the fault of my integrated graphics over the game itself.\n\nAll in all, a great buy. For the lovers of the franchise, it brings back old memories blissfully. For the newcommers, it will be a new, unique journey.","June 13, 2014","true","17.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Well.\n\nIt was the 27th of Febuary 2016, it was saturday... The battle of the warring states (thats the map).\nKorea 1 and Mongolia against Korea 2 and China\nSo the game started off slow asf with nobody doing anything for about 10 minutes until the Chinese decided to ♥♥♥♥ and pillage the Mongols because it definitly wasn't the other way round in history.. Anyways Korea 1 which is me decides to turtle whereas my ally Mongolia gets bum rushed by crazy Chinese infidels from Chinaaaaa! While my ally gets destroyed and loses a city which I both cannot remember or pronounce the name off I decide to build a lovely statue in memory of classical era Kim Jong Un or the correct name for it is the Colossus but I wanted it to be the supreme leader therefore it is the supreme leader. After I built this incredible statue, my ally was able to push the blasted Chinese back and was then able to capture their city back. Where is Korea 2 you maybe asking? Well they literally just sat there watching China do all the work whilst they listened to PSI's Gangnam Style because that song is the true meaning of peace within south Korea. Eventually Korea 2 and China decided to double team my ally with an endless wave of firework shooter people things, this made me react with my supreme leader and his army of merry men! We pushed them back again only to have lost half of our army... "Stupid Mongolians!" The game went on for a good half an hour with constant border disputes which made our match be like the Korean War with both sides at a stalemate. Both teams were both expanding and colonizing islands whilst everything was going on, this allowed us to get more dumplings for our soliders to fight in battle. As both sides progessed to the industrial era, me or Korea 1 and my ally Mongolia were able to take the Chinese city Chengdu which created a foothold for our armies to give grief to the enemies. With the Forbidden City built by Kim Jong Un on one of my islands I was able to research nuclear weapons whilst my ally worked on fortifying the frontline with a giant army with the enemy doing the same thing. Eventually I was able to build several silos which enabled me to Korea the s**t out of everyone because I could press the red button and unleash thermonuclear warfare on the Chinese cities of Shanghi and Beijing along with 2 other warheads blowing up their military facilities which were luckily all clumped together. This finally allowed both me and my ally to push forward and take their cities with no hassle at all. While all this was going on I decided to choose my newly appointed president of north Korea, Kim Jong Un who was also the Despot and King of Korea several hundreds ago to lead this epic advance into the heart of China. With China uttely F****d, Korea 2 was the only one left standing with a useless army and low resources. Eliminating them was quick due to the ultimate ability to utilize nuclear weapons. F**K YOU KOREA 2! YOU SUCK MA KOREAN BALLS!\n\nSO! Would I recommend this game? Yeah I would! Its basically like Age of Empires only in my opinion its more in depth. The research tree is quite big and you are able to go from the stone age I think it is, all the way to the Information age allowing you to experience all styles of play. One age is full of swords, slings, bows, horses, crappy boats and pebble throwing trebuchet whereas the other age allows you to use rifles, bazookas, planes, helicopters, tanks, warships and everybodies personal favourite... Nukes! There's awider rang of unit types but there's a lot sooo if you get the game you can find out what they are!\nI would definitly advice you to get this game due to the fact that its just generally awesome.\n10/10 would Kim Jung Un again.","February 26","true","26.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","5","7","2","0"

You research four different categories Military, Civics, Commerce, and Science to progress from Ancient Age to Information Age (full on stealth bombers and nukes). There are tons of different civs to choose from, each one featuring its own unique units and civ bonuses. Where Rise of Nations really shines, though, is in its Conquer the World Risk-style campaign. This is hands-down one of the best single player experiences you are likely to get. Not only is it the best implementation of this style of campaign gameplay but each overworld encounter can lead to a multitude of different scenarios in the RTS proper. It's still my favorite campaign style ever made and it's a real shame it never caught on in other games.\n\nSo really, why should you buy this? Because even with the slightly outdated graphics this is still one of the best RTSes made of all time. This Extended Edition re-release simply makes a great game even better, with tons of multiplayer improvements across the board (especially as this game was originally hosted by now defunct Gamespy). This is one of those games that, even before it was re-released, I threw in my computer about once a year (from my original CD) and happily played.\n\nBuy it, you won't be disappointed","August 3, 2014","true","4.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JamesBastian/recommended/287450/","JamesBastian","James","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JamesBastian/","257 products in account","An epic classic that combines the elements of a more complex game like Civilization, with the less management based feeling of games like Age of Empires. A strange blend that somehow works for the better. If you're an RTS fan looking for a new stallion for the stable, or a Civilization fan looking for something a little bit more fast pased, then short answer is you'll probably like this.\n\nNow, the long answer is that this game is a blend of the empire management features from Civ, such as working about captured 'rare resources', expanding the available territory you own, and harvesting resources without them being harvested away completely.\n\nFrom Age of Empires, the game draws the faster pased action of the mixed unit combat, and the tactical rock-paper-scissors between units, along side the actual building of cities and structures, and rapid pase of gameplay to advance through the ages.\n\nHowever, Rise of Nations brings fresh concepts to the table, such as units in foreign territory having to deal with 'attrition' which slowly drains their health unless kept in supply with wagons. As well as a VERY customizable single AND multiplayer game hosting which allows you to adjust a fair few options to better suit your playstyle, and nations to support this without being cripplingly overspecialized.\n\nThe biggest negatives I can point to in this particular incairnation of the series are that the water reflection graphical option seems to cause severe lag issues on older, more middle range computers, and that the game itself does NOT like to be alt-tabbed in any sense, I myself have had issues where doing this causes my entire computer to lag severely, and re-enlarging the game has causes the in-game audio to drop out. Also, the largest maps seem to perhaps have issues with not playing well when hosted, often causing players to drop. Perhaps the worst though is that there is MINOR desync between players when the matches get particularly heavy, with multiple nations and massive armies squaring off, but even then it's minor at worst.\n\nIf you're willing to put up with a game that's got a few warts, being pretty much a re-release of an existing game, then Rise of Nations is a definate consideration. If you're looking for a unique, very underappreciated gem in the RTS genre, then by all means consider the game. If you're looking for a perfect diamond that fixes all the existing issues, then please consider something else, or just don't complain when it isn't flawless.","June 15, 2014","true","29.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you never played Rise of Nations, and you like RTS games, then you absolutely need to pick this up.\n\nFirst, remember it's a remaster of a game that, like I said, is 10 years old, so don't pick it up expecting it to look like Starcraft II.  The textures were updated to look like they did when the game first came out, but with today's higher resolutions, so they're not blocky, but you can't see the facial expressions on your citizens either.\n\nWith standard settings, you start off in what's basically the stone age.  You have a small town, you can gather food and wood, but little else.  With some basic research, you're off and running into the Classical Age, where you can start getting better buildings, mine metal, have your scholars conduct research, and start building your army.\n\nResearch takes you across eight ages, finally leaving you in the Information Age, complete with fighters, bombers, cruise and nuclear missiles, Space Programs, and Supercolliders.  If you've played Empire Earth, you should feel right at home.\n\nIt's definitely one of my favorite, if not my favorite RTS games of all time.  My biggest gripe is the population cap is limited to 200, or 250 if you have certain wonders.  For $20 I don't think you can go wrong with this, but if it's on sale and you're an RTS person, you'd be doing yourself a disservice if you take a pass on this one.\n\nJust as a caveat to my review, though, I have only played this singleplayer, and that probably won't change unless I get some friends into it, so if multiplayer is your aim, might want to check the forums and see if they've patched out the "bugs."  I put it in quotes because I haven't seen any, nor have a lot of people, but just be aware that there are supposedly a few at tht time of this writing.","June 15, 2014","true","33.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Radically different but also intuitive, Rise of Nations represents a clear evolutionary step in the RTS genre years after its initial release.  Excellently balanced between military and civic development, the game is perpetually a race to bigger and better things in lieu of the typical zerg rush of modern strategy trappings.\n\nIn the vein of turn based strategy games, the civic portion of your society is equally important to the aspect of military dominance of your opponent.  Moving at a constant pace seems like a frantic addition to a real time strategy, but it's handled expertly by categorizing the different parts of your society, such as military developments and economic additions.  As your society expands, you research different epochs of civilization, moving from simple trappings to a modern society.\n\nA starting civilization has a city, library, and a couple of farms and wood cutters.  It quickly grows to encompass a mighty empire, but does so in a logical way with resources evolving to fit the times.  At first, food and wood are the primary resources, but quickly this morphs to ore and knowledge, and then moves to finally to ore and iron.  The progression succinctly reflects a modern society, and is intuitive.\n\nFrom the humble worker to the greatest sea vessel, upgrades are represented visually and functionally, as fire ships eventually become submarines, biplanes become jet fighters, and cavalry turn into fearsome tanks.  Tactics lean slightly towards rock paper scissors and wolf pack tactics over strategic play, but largely a well governed force will overcome superior numbers if targeting is well managed.  This becomes apparent during the later epochs when submarines wreak havoc in engagements with larger ships.  Buildings follow a similar ascetic, reflecting your advancement through the ages.  Beyond being a visual treat, it serves as a visual aid for your progress in the game without having to hunt through menus.\n\nFollowing the ascetic are upgrades that are logically suited to both the locations they're available at as well as the time they're in.  Libraries act as a central research hub, and offer the multitude of civilization advances you'd expect for a modern society.  Mining organizations grow to improve operations, barracks improve soldiers, and so forth.  It's a simple design choice, but welcome due to the massive amount of improvements available.  Being appropriate to the age is an added bonus, further adding to your immersion.\n\nExcellent gameplay extends to the multiplayer arena, with excellent optimization for online play making play a breeze.  The options are somewhat limited for multiplayer, with only a handful of maps offered.  More variety would have helped, but the game excels where it counts.\n\nUnique and enthralling, Rise of Nations is a treat to play.  A brilliant reproduction of the history of modern societies, it captures the choices of a civil enterprise with the expanse of a military empire.  After all this time, it still stands as a strong testament of design and aesthetic which will keep you coming back for countless hours of empire building.","August 5, 2014","true","2.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You start in the early ages of wooden sticks and tools and slowly (or quickly if you change the settings) to the industrial age of muskets and redcoats and then even all the way up to the modern day age with nuclear weapons, tanks and machine guns.\n\nThis games has some features that I really like that other RTS's of this type don't have. These are things such as territories based on cities and castles you make, attrition damage to enemy or neutral nations in your territory and the ability to cause the game to end as a draw by the over use of nuclear weapons on a map.\n\nThere is a conquer the world campaign that can be done but requires hours and hours to complete which might leave some players bored but great supporters of the game to enjoy. It, in the simplest explanation possible, is a turn based map in which you chose to invade each time, another location to attack which leads into a RTS battle each time in which the winner takes the territory. This can cause some players to get bored of this but many game types are added into the battles to cause a variety of gameplay.\n\nOverall I think "Rise of Nations" is an amazing game which takes some of the greatest bits of other strategy games and combines them with unique ideas to create this masterpiece. 10/10 recommend this game.","August 8, 2014","true","25.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Anyway, why do you want to buy this game?\nIt's immersive. It sucks you in, spits you out, and you rebuild, start over and then do it all over again. Its unique, not repetitive, and just simply amazing gameplay. You can create your own scenarios, and now, you can download other peoples scenarios through Steam Workshop! Even better! You don't have to join through IP anymore, just invite your friend and off you go. Are you a beginner to strategy games? Don't worry, this is the perfect beginner strategy game, and is also for the hardcore strategy players too! Also with the Conqour the World scenarios, you can change history to suit you, such as being the Aztecs and taking over the whole of America (Spoiler: They didn't). This game is unrivaled by other strategy games, and is easily the best game I have ever played, my absolute favourite game in the whole world, even more than Halo 2 (But just a bit more)!

Annoyed with waiting another turn in civ when you could just tell that f*cking worker to come here?\nRoN is the logical extension of that, it goes beyond the tried and true modalities of standard rts fare and achieves something hardly any other rts or for that matter game has tried.\n\nWith the tech tree removed, the player doesn't have to wonder what logical pathways the authors followed when they had you go from wheel to the binocular to the atom bomb. What you've got here is streamlined: Pop cap bothering you? Military upgrade. Wanna expand? Civics. Commerce cap? Economy. Production too low? Science of course!\nAnd then you advance to the next age.\nWhich does look substantially different. The architecture, the playstyle (in part), the units all look like they're really from the future compared to the loincloth wearing barbarians you started with.\n\nThere are races, and they do get bonuses, which feel more like personalized cheat codes. What else would you call instant worker spawn (china), extra city expansion (zulus), 3 free horse archers per stable (mongols), 2 extra max farms (egyptians), no borders (some indian tribe), double capital (persians) etc.?\nWIth so many nations it's not hard to find one to suit your playstyle depending on what you feel in the morning.\n\nLittle caveat: The game is ideological, the two types of government have a clear bias, one "libertarian" (democracy/republic/capitalism) against one "authoritarian" (despotism/monarchy/socialism). But it's not as visibly overbearing as what civlization does, where the difference between being LITERALLY FASCIST NAZI HITLER and a snarky liberal late night talk show host is wether you pick assembly line or the scientific method.\n\nWhat's more like age of empires is the warfare, it's the good old rock paper scissor we all love to hate: cavalry beats archer, archer beats infantry, infantry crushed beneath the treads of a tank, tank is nuked by the science civilization.\nThe difference between one age and nother is evident, especially in gameplay, if you don't catch up you're dead behind.\nCastles and towers and barracks and siege workshops all work exactly like they did in aoe2, with the thing above as well as expanding and contracting borders.\n\nEspecially with the HD re-release, everythign is polished and overpolished, with one click you can get into multiplayer or stream on twitch or start a mod up.","May 20","true","29.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It is the standard by which I use to judge all RTS games and I'm glad to say the Extended Edition has brought it back, with improvements! This has to be one of the greatest RTS games of all time (course I'm a bit sentimental) and it is extremely pleasing to see it brought back.\n\nThe Good: Classic RTS that won 2003 PC Game of the Year remastered, still great controls, music is still amazing (always felt a sense of wonder when listening to it), fantastic RTS formula of gather and fight, killing bombers with arrows (I know what your thinking: "how'd Civ Rev get in here!? wtf!?"), cheats still work (type in "cheat nuke" without the quotes...or maybe it's just "nuke"...but anyways don't have cursor over your base!), graphics are aged but still impressive considering when game was done, comes with the expansion Thrones & Patriots which added some improvements to original game along with more people ('Murica & Associates), advancing through ages can be interesting (see "killing bombers with archers" above), great campaigns, nations are varied with both traits and units that can extend through ages (lookin at you Mayans & Aztecs), just a dam good game\n\nThe Bad: graphics are aged a bit (gotta crticize somethin), camera can be weird at times, not realizing cheats still worked and annihilating your Classical Age town, AI is more intelligent than you think (not a bad thing as much as unexpected), some research is a bit tedious\n\nThe Ugly: I WANT TO SEE RISE OF LEGENDS REMASTERED!! COME ON GUYS!!\n\nOverall, great remastery of classic RTS and something I completely forget about and put my orginal disc in everytime.

Rise of Nations permits players to advance through eight "ages", representing all of human history from the classical Greco-Roman empires all the way to the modern day. Critically, Rise of Nations manages to be engaging every step of the way.\n\nOnly one other RTS I know of shares Rise of Nation's gimmick - Empire Earth, a game with an inarguably stronger focus on detail and historical accuracy (And the addition of cool future ages). However, where Empire Earth excels in its detail and its mimicry of the sweeping changes in warfare which occur between each great technological age (and the complete uselessness of obsolete units), Rise of Nations is more accessible and more streamlined for the sort of gameplay both games forward.\n\nThe traditional RTS formula is a worker unit is sent to collect resources, it collects until its capacity is full, and then it returns the load to a central gathering point. This continues until the worker is killed, resources run out, the gathering point is destroyed, or the worker is given a different order. This is the formula used by StarCraft, StarCraft II, Age of Empires, Age of Empires II, Empire Earth, Empire Earth II, and nearly every other RTS game. It's a good system - it forces players to keep expanding to acquire new resources, attaches a hard limit to the amount one worker can help the economy, and gives the OPFOR plenty of opportunities to interrupt supply shipments.\n\nRise of Nations breaks from tradition in this respect. In Rise of Nations, it is necessary to construct specialized gathering points for each resource - Mines for metal, Farms for food, Woodcutter camps for Timber, Universities for Knowledge, and Oil Wells for Oil. Farms, Oil Wells, and Universities produce a set amount of their respective resources per worker garrisoned in them, and each have their own unique rules. Mines and Woodcutter camps have different maximum garrison capacities depending on exactly where they're placed - a small mountain may mean a Mine can only have three workers, but a huge forest may let a Woodcutter camp have ten. Once the gathering point has been constructed and the workers garrisoned, the gathering point provides a set amount of resources every 30 seconds until destroyed or the workers are given other tasks (Resources never run out).\n\nIn Empire Earth, the core gameplay is about the military-industrial complex. It takes so long to replace dead units and destroyed buildings that the game becomes about forcing the enemy away from those things. With resources scattered across the map, elements of risk are inescapable and it's just a reality that there will be no effective central organization of any army since walling a settlement in is so expensive. Everything you do in Empire Earth relates back to protecting your military buildings because if they are destroyed you won't get an opportunity to replace them.\n\nIn Rise of Nations, core gameplay is about map control. Map control is represented by "territory", multicolored lines drawn on the land itself to show which player has control of what. Territory grants a lot of benefits - it increases the firing rate of your artillery, damages enemy units, lets you place down buildings, and can grant other abilities depending on your nation specialty. The earliest, and most significant, provider of territory are cities. You begin the game with one city, and it is by cities that Rise of Nations is won or lost. If your capital city is taken, you have a limited amount of time to take it back or every building you own defects to the player who took your capital and all your units commit hara-kiri. Needless to say, you're defeated. The city is more than just a gaping strategic vulnerability, however - it's the biggest sole provider of territory, and the biggest contributor to a player in Rise of Nations.\n\nCities have a radius, called an "economic radius", within which they provide extra health to buildings and can supercharge the gathering rates of resource structures by up to three times. Additionally, some buildings can only be built in cities (Universities, Markets, Oil Refineries, Granaries, Lumber Mills, Smelters, Senates, Temples, Libraries, Farms). Most of these buildings are huge contributors in Rise of Nations, so cities are very important. A city can be upgraded, with its economic radius and benefit to building health growing as more types of buildings are constructed in it. On top of that, cities heal units garrisoned inside them and themselves fire on enemy units if there are units inside the city. Accordingly, a city and its civilians can stand off military units acting alone. Cities also provide small incomes of Food and Timber.\n\nCities are automatically named after historical cities of that nation, but can be renamed. Everything you do in Rise of Nations goes back to your cities, back to the complicated web of buildings you've constructed in them. Ultimately, even special world wonders can be constructed in cities to provide unique bonuses to your nation.\n\nAnd that brings us to the military aspect. War is very much a part of Rise of Nations, and it is the best way to win matches. In Empire Earth and most RTs games, it is necessary to order every individual soldier, but Rise of Nations offers us something called an "infinite queue" which causes a building to repeat its build orders until the building is destroyed, resources run out, or the population limit is reached. The infinite queue changes RTS warfare by letting a game as macro as Rise of Nations be about the macro. With enough resources, it is not merely possible but practical to overrun an opponent with sheer numbers or keep an airbase constantly supplying planes to a beleaguered front. But merely because I am a fan of the hammer that is a horde of thousands of soldiers charging doesn't mean there aren't other, more tactical options available. There are. Generals passively increase the survivability of your soldiers and offer special abilities useful for outmaneuvering and outguessing opponents while spies can make enemy units spy for you or actively turn them to your side and explorers kill enemy spies, blow up buildings, and snipe vulnerable military units. Missile silos can blow up any specific enemy building with a cruise missile, or devastate the economic radius of a fully mature city with a nuke. Airbases send out fighters to pick off enemy units, kill generals and shoot down bombers or launch brute waves of their own bombers to batter down enemy buildings. Attack helicopters pick off ridiculous numbers of tanks and submarines for their cost while being immune to any return fire. Ranged cavalry and armored cars can pick off generals and supply wagons to let enemy soldiers die from territory damage, or conduct deep raids to kill enemy workers and weaken their economy. On top of all this, special generals are available from the Senate who provide unique benefits in addition to game-long bonuses to your nation.\n\nIn addition, strategic resources are available which both provide additional income of basic resources but offer special abilities (Some of which are more or less overpowered). Basically, who your nation is and precisely what its good at evolves dynamically through the game based on what opportunities are available, what is exploited, what you started with, and what your opponent(s) do. On top of all this, there's a highly amusing "conquer the world" mode which serves as the game's campaigns. Basically, this mode links all the battles you fight to tell the story of a great empire from the beginning of its history to the day it conquered the world or failed to do so.\n\nBut the best part of Rise of Nations is how it all comes together. I'm about at the character limit, so take the fact that I'm not even close to done talking speak for itself. I highly recommend it if you have any room in your heart.","November 25, 2014","true","55.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Farms, Oil Wells, and Universities produce a set amount of their respective resources per worker garrisoned in them, and each have their own unique rules. Mines and Woodcutter camps have different maximum garrison capacities depending on exactly where they're placed - a small mountain may mean a Mine can only have three workers, but a huge forest may let a Woodcutter camp have ten. Once the gathering point has been constructed and the workers garrisoned, the gathering point provides a set amount of resources every 30 seconds until destroyed or the workers are given other tasks (Resources never run out).\n\nIn Empire Earth, the core gameplay is about the military-industrial complex. It takes so long to replace dead units and destroyed buildings that the game becomes about forcing the enemy away from those things. With resources scattered across the map, elements of risk are inescapable and it's just a reality that there will be no effective central organization of any army since walling a settlement in is so expensive. Everything you do in Empire Earth relates back to protecting your military buildings because if they are destroyed you won't get an opportunity to replace them.\n\nIn Rise of Nations, core gameplay is about map control. Map control is represented by "territory", multicolored lines drawn on the land itself to show which player has control of what. Territory grants a lot of benefits - it increases the firing rate of your artillery, damages enemy units, lets you place down buildings, and can grant other abilities depending on your nation specialty. The earliest, and most significant, provider of territory are cities. You begin the game with one city, and it is by cities that Rise of Nations is won or lost. If your capital city is taken, you have a limited amount of time to take it back or every building you own defects to the player who took your capital and all your units commit hara-kiri. Needless to say, you're defeated. The city is more than just a gaping strategic vulnerability, however - it's the biggest sole provider of territory, and the biggest contributor to a player in Rise of Nations.\n\nCities have a radius, called an "economic radius", within which they provide extra health to buildings and can supercharge the gathering rates of resource structures by up to three times. Additionally, some buildings can only be built in cities (Universities, Markets, Oil Refineries, Granaries, Lumber Mills, Smelters, Senates, Temples, Libraries, Farms). Most of these buildings are huge contributors in Rise of Nations, so cities are very important. A city can be upgraded, with its economic radius and benefit to building health growing as more types of buildings are constructed in it. On top of that, cities heal units garrisoned inside them and themselves fire on enemy units if there are units inside the city. Accordingly, a city and its civilians can stand off military units acting alone. Cities also provide small incomes of Food and Timber.\n\nCities are automatically named after historical cities of that nation, but can be renamed. Everything you do in Rise of Nations goes back to your cities, back to the complicated web of buildings you've constructed in them. Ultimately, even special world wonders can be constructed in cities to provide unique bonuses to your nation.\n\nAnd that brings us to the military aspect. War is very much a part of Rise of Nations, and it is the best way to win matches. In Empire Earth and most RTs games, it is necessary to order every individual soldier, but Rise of Nations offers us something called an "infinite queue" which causes a building to repeat its build orders until the building is destroyed, resources run out, or the population limit is reached. The infinite queue changes RTS warfare by letting a game as macro as Rise of Nations be about the macro. With enough resources, it is not merely possible but practical to overrun an opponent with sheer numbers or keep an airbase constantly supplying planes to a beleaguered front. But merely because I am a fan of the hammer that is a horde of thousands of soldiers charging doesn't mean there aren't other, more tactical options available. There are. Generals passively increase the survivability of your soldiers and offer special abilities useful for outmaneuvering and outguessing opponents while spies can make enemy units spy for you or actively turn them to your side and explorers kill enemy spies, blow up buildings, and snipe vulnerable military units. Missile silos can blow up any specific enemy building with a cruise missile, or devastate the economic radius of a fully mature city with a nuke. Airbases send out fighters to pick off enemy units, kill generals and shoot down bombers or launch brute waves of their own bombers to batter down enemy buildings. Attack helicopters pick off ridiculous numbers of tanks and submarines for their cost while being immune to any return fire. Ranged cavalry and armored cars can pick off generals and supply wagons to let enemy soldiers die from territory damage, or conduct deep raids to kill enemy workers and weaken their economy. On top of all this, special generals are available from the Senate who provide unique benefits in addition to game-long bonuses to your nation.\n\nIn addition, strategic resources are available which both provide additional income of basic resources but offer special abilities (Some of which are more or less overpowered). Basically, who your nation is and precisely what its good at evolves dynamically through the game based on what opportunities are available, what is exploited, what you started with, and what your opponent(s) do. On top of all this, there's a highly amusing "conquer the world" mode which serves as the game's campaigns. Basically, this mode links all the battles you fight to tell the story of a great empire from the beginning of its history to the day it conquered the world or failed to do so.\n\nBut the best part of Rise of Nations is how it all comes together. I'm about at the character limit, so take the fact that I'm not even close to done talking speak for itself. I highly recommend it if you have any room in your heart.","November 25, 2014","true","55.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There is a ton of variety, whether it comes to civ choices, map choices, victory conditions, etc, there is just a ton of customizability for each game you play meaning that the replay value for this title is immense.\n\nMy only complaint, which isn't really a complaint but more of an observation, is that late-game multiplayer can often end up being a stalemate unless a team fails to research Missile Shields and gets themselves nuked. I find this is mostly due to the static resources, where unlike games such as Age of Empires, your resources are unlimited in the sense  that you never have to worry about moving that citizen and finding another oil well, forest, or mountain, because they will never run dry, be completely cut down, or mined of all its minerals.\n\nOverall, I'd have to give this game an 9/10. It's a superb game, with superb replay value.","November 20, 2014","true","146.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a classic example of a game that's easy to learn and hard to master. A typical game starts in a medieval era and ends in a post-modern age, giving you a real sense of progression and escalation as more players unlock access to planes, submarines, and nukes. Oh, nukes. Love 'em or hate 'em, nukes are perhaps the most iconic part of Rise of Nations.\n\nI've mostly played multiplayer, so I can't say much about the Conquer the World campaigns, but they do look pretty cool.\n\nAs far as the what the "Extended Edition" offers, not much. It's basically the original RoN you know and love (and its expansion) brought into the Steam platform with achievements and all that stuff.\n\nIf you've never played it before, it's definitely worth checking out. If you still own the original, it's still worth getting if only for the sake of playing with your friends over Steam, but perhaps wait until it's on a nice sale.","December 25, 2015","true","5.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It captures so much of what Age of Empires does right and presents it on a slightly larger scale. The campaigns are a blast as you get to play various countries vying for control of different regions. You can play a North American campaign, for example, as either the the British, the Americans, the French, or the Native Americans. Each with their own unique requirements for winning. It has other campaigns in Europe, also with various countries requiring unique goals to win, and even a campaign to try and take over the word!

I was playing this yesterday on my laptop. 2 hours of ultimate warfare. This is a very addictive game, your choices on the battlefield influences the way which the battle is won. I am very impressed with the different eras in the game from the earliest stages of history to the modern. Technology advancement of unit changes with the era. Amazing battlefield match ups. There was a point in the game where I felt I was going to lose instead, I used my flamethrower infantry to burn the opposition down.\n\nFAST PACED GAME. LOTS OF UNIQUE UNITS, MUSIC IS ALWAYS HISTORICAL, DIFFERENT ERAS IN HISTORY = EPIC GAME TO HAVE.\n\nLike I said before 2 hours of ultimate OWNAGE. Lots of strategical moves to win the battle. I would HIGHLY reccommend this game to anyone that is a HUGGGGGGGE fan of RTS games.\n\n10/10 RISE OF NATION = TOTAL DOMINATION.","June 13, 2014","true","6.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

However it being a re-release of the orginal game from 2003, you might ask WHAT IS NEW? Well it has been given some polishing and tweaks to bring it into 2014, it features a ton of nations with a variety of units for you to play and advance through the ages of Ancient to Infomation age. Whether you just want to destory defenseless spearmen with your team of musket men or just be evil and launch nuclear armegeddon upon everyone, you should get this game for the love of all that is amazing and RTS.\n\nMy only drawback of the release to steam is at this current time they haven't added any mod support/Steam Workshop integration, and Steam's invite to game feature doesn't actually invite your friend it just informs you to look at the server browser.","June 14, 2014","true","12.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The tragedy is that only die hards of this game still play it and will be shooting missles at you while you just figured out how to shoot an arrow.\n\nWhat I am saying is, this game is very hard to learn and then compete with people online. Especially given it is a revamped HD version of a game that came out a decade ago.\n\nI recommend this game if you're okay with\n1) sticking to playing against AI for a long, long time\n2) enjoy getting stomped online very easily\n3) okay with playing a revamped game from a decade ago and willing to learn its high learning curve\n\nThe game truly is a blast from the past, if its on sale and you have friends willing to play with you I think you'll have some real fun with it as its a very cheap $4.99 on sale. I still think civ v is much more worth it and when civ v is on sale its $12.00 for the vanilla game and all the DLC.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/guiltyascharged/recommended/287450/","guiltyascharged","TheRealRazgriz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/guiltyascharged/","282 products in account","Microsoft lately has been on a quest to re-release every sucessful game they ever had, updated and modernized. I have mixed feelings about this. Although I love these games and the re-releases are good the prices have been an issue. I don't feel that $30/40 is fair for these games, and they are on the right path by decreasing the price of RoN to $15 pre-release and $20 on release, which would be a fair price for other re-releases such as Age of Mythology and AoE 2. Now to the game itself.\n\nRise of Nations is one of, if not my favorite RTS game of all time. It blends various game concepts from games such as Civilization and Age of Empires and makes a masterpiece. This game is HEAVILY micro-management centric, where the nation with the greatest economic output, and the player who can manage that economic output efficiently, is going to win. Resources on the map are infinite, however productivity is everything, managing exactly how many woodcutting camps you need to sustain your growth without sacrificing, say mining metal for example. The combat in this game is also well balanced, focusing on a good mix of units rather than unit spam. Unique units are brought to the table just like in Civilization that each Nation has that can give them a slight advantage, however every unit always has a counter or way to be defeated. There's no "stacks of death" or "zerg rush" in this game, and that is one reason I also like it. I've been the smaller nation holding off spams of cheap units from bigger nations sucessfully many times. I wish more modern RTS games existed like this....I could only imagine the cores of this game being molded into a modern RTS...it would be grand.\n\n10/10","June 14, 2014","true","95.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Whilst this version integrates with Steam, I feel it isn't a genuine improvement over the original. Yes, the models appear to be anti-aliased now, but this renders them blurry instead. It has annoying bugs like not respecting the volume of music for each track (you literally have to go and interact with the volume slider every track change - and I like the RoN music, thanks).\n\nThis is the same game, and this is a low price. As someone who loved the original, this was removed and the original reinstalled. Go and get a budget branded version of this game on CD, it's the original, superior experience. But that is somewhat akin to saying this is Pepsi and RoN original is Coke - on a hot day, it doesn't really matter.","December 21, 2014","false","16.6"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","9","17","0","0"

Perfect! I loved this game years ago and I still love it now. This game is the perfect older strategy game that blends combat and resource gathering without too much micromanagement. Simply put, You are not building 1000 farms and moving citizens around while you are in combat. The AI is still fairly strong. With lots of options, this game offers a lot of choices and interesting mechanics.\n\nGo from early ages to the near future and explore different types of combat options. From tanks to cavalry, you will experience dramatically different types of combat during each stage of the match. You can play early age only matches and enjoy some medieval combat or go go to the modern ages warring with nuclear arms. Protecting your cities will help, but wonders are your key buildings and keeping them standing will get you advance fighters much faster. Imagine how tense it can be when you are researching Nuclear Shield hoping that no one is going to nuke your wonders as a parting gift.\n\nWith tons of modes, a very unique and great campaign, great game play, and a decent soundtrack, this game is definitely worth the purchase.\n\nThis game is so much fun. Rise of Nations has nice HD, rarely ever crashes, runs smoothly and all around impresses me. Online is even much better than I expected. The lobby is especially helpful when looking for a game. My one and only gripe with the HD reboot stems with the online however. The problem is that no one is playing this game online. I occasionally see a game going but I can never get into a match or stay in one without half the players dropping at start. If you are thinking about getting this game for solo or local game play, you should. It has so much to offer. You will enjoy every second of it. But if you are expecting great online strategy battles,you might want to look elsewhere. As much as I hope that the online portion of this game will pick up, I don't see it happening anytime soon. Until this game gets more players, I am sticking to solo and local area net.","September 25, 2014","true","50.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The addition "Thrones and Patriots" was a bless and increased the debth of the game. With Extended Edition hopefully multiplayer is livened up again.\n\nThe graphics have never been important for me in RoN. True, the EE graphics are somewhat better, but that is not the reason to buy it. I would recommend to buy it for people who do not own RoN yet, as well to people who would love to participate in multiplayer. Hopefully the EOL system will successfully kick in and the amount of players doing PvP increases.\n\nThere are some bugs introduced with this version of the game, but it seems that currently they are fixing them, silently (for example the ALT + Tab sound problem seems to be fixed). Multiplayer crashes from time to time, making the game also crash/close. Single player seems to be working well, at least I have not gotten any problems with that (true, I mostly do multiplayer/quick matches).\n\nOverall a recommended buy for RTS fans.","June 16, 2014","true","46.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

That's what this game is, you research tech and build unique structures, but it basically is a RTS version of Civ. And I freaking love it. I played this game religiously as a kid, an now that I've come back, it's even better. More Nations, more units, more single player stuff, everything had been made better. Since war and alliances are the only option (A difference from Civ), the main stratagy comes from building more powerful cities, researching tech's at different times, and building a varied army from a wide selection of units. Everythings strong against something and weak against something else, but racial bonuses make some ventures more worthwhile. Do you build all melee and just overwhelm them? Or do you make an entire battalion of ranged units and kill them before they get close? And now, with an advanced Conquer the World campaign (Basically a game of risk with detailed combat) which includes awesome, unique scenarios, this game has wedged itself back into my heart, and my schedule.","June 19, 2014","true","19.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Snowraven/recommended/287450/","Snowraven","Ravenblade","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Snowraven/","149 products in account","Rise of Nations has been one of my favourite RTS franchises of the past and I am pretty happy to see a modern makeover of it with a fair pricing tag attached to it.\n\nMy favourite gameplay mode is Conquer the World also called CtW. It combines Risk-like gameplay during grand-strategical phase while providing a unique RTS experience "on ground" when the actual fight for a territory happens.\n\nDuring the RTS phase you are able to progress one age further than that of the world's phase offering a different style of gameplay for each of the 24 nations as the world goes through different ages starting with the Ancient Age where units die fast but come cheap to the fast-paced Information Age filled with danger and nuclear excitement.\n\nInstead of building traditional bases players build towns which can be expanded with buildings providing specialized civilian units such as the caravan, the merchant for controlling and mining unique resources, as well as buildings specialized for the economic needs and strengths of the area around the town starting with their regional capital. Each town may also expand national borders which can then be fortified by manned or unmanned towers and fortresses. In short the economical side of the game is very fleshed out and has an amazing depth.\n\nThe fierce fighting against an AI which is still ahead of most if not all RTS AIs I have had the pleasure to play against.\n\nThe choice of units is not huge even with the unique units aside it's down to three types of infantry units per age, 2-3 cavalry/mechanized units, and one type siege and supply unit each and 4 kinds of military ships.  This is not counting special units like scout units, generals and yes, spies which do spy-ey things, fishing boats and transports. However the difference is that with each major age they get upgraded to a different type of unit also shifting their roles and importance.\n\nThe game includes the addon Thrones and Patriots which adds government, all the remaining civs and wonders (only actively buildable in skirmish and coop but may appear as regional feature on world map still).\n\nOverall a recommendable game for those who want a different RTS experience and take a break from all that MOBA gaming.","September 23, 2014","true","38.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The strategic map is awesome, and the RTS component is okay, but you spend all your time fighting against your own troops.\n\nAttrition means your men take damage if they move away from a supply cart.\nYour men chase after anything they see in every direction and are always in an agressive stance, with no way to stop them.\nSupply carts often charge into the enemies.\n\nAs a result, the RTS game is a combination of:\n- Desperately trying to make your guys focus on staying in a group with the supply carts, general and catapults they have to protect instead of running off after lone villagers and leaving the former 3 to die.\n- Spam clicking on barracks/stables to replace all the ones that die all the time\n\nSo many good ideas, just ruined by the screwed up RTS component.

Her husband who was bald and named Walter was watching the movie Scarface with his son Flynn who was really named Walter Junior. However, he was not bald like his father. Who was named Walter. Not Junior. The bald man with lung cancer turned around and faced the woman who went by the last name White and the first name Skyler. "Do you want to join us in watching the movie called Scarface", asked Walter White. Skyler looked at him. She wanted to ♥♥♥♥ her boss who went by the name that was Ted, but he slipped and broke his skull. Because he did bad things. "No", she said, as she thought about dancing mushrooms in a forest that looked like Bambi's best friend Joe. "Well you can SUCK MY ♥♥♥♥ YOU ♥♥♥♥ING ANGRY ♥♥♥♥♥", Walt screamed as he pummeled his wife into the ground. Skyler screamed and tried to run, but her husband was too strong for her. "WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU", he screamed, "WHY DON'T YOU LOVE ME ANYMORE" "D-d-dad s-stop", screamed his son named Walter Junior who had a palsy of cerebral. Not celebrate. Like a birthday party. "♥♥♥♥ YOU JUNIOR, SUCK MY ♥♥♥♥ YOU CRIPPLED ♥♥♥♥♥♥", he screamed, as Walter Junior burst into tears. Walt then chucked his infant daughter named Hollie at his wife. The baby smacked her in the face, before hitting the floor and screaming. "SHUT UP", he screamed at the baby, then at his bloody wife. He pounced upon her and best her in the face a few times, before taking a break to squeeze her breasts. "Honk honk", he laughed. Then he grabbed Walter Junior by the neck, and also grabbed his wife Skyler there too. He dragged both of them to the oven, and set it for 360 degrees. "SEE YOU IN HELL, YOU ♥♥♥♥♥UCKERS", he screamed before shutting the door and ending his wife and son's lives, "THEN YOU'LL LEARN TO APPRECIATE MY WORK". Then he threw his daughter Hollie in there and sat waiting. Bored, he lit a match and poured some gasoline. He drove to the partner he called Pinkman first name Jesse, and burst through the door. Jesse was ♥♥♥♥ing his girlfriend, and her son was playing video games. "WHERE IS HE", Walt screamed at the kid. The kid stared at him for a bit. "TELL ME OR I'LL GIVE YOU POISON AGAIN", he screamed before the child pointed to the bedroom. Walt jumped into bed with Jesse and his girlfriend, and they did it. They had a surprise three way, and then a four way with Jesse's dead girlfriend's ghost. They dedicated the four way to Gustavo Fring, who loved doing four ways with the twin cousins and Hector Salamanka in the wheelchair. Jesse cried with angst, then screamed at his meth making partner. "Yo Mr. White, why did you ♥♥♥♥ me ♥♥♥♥♥". Walt licked him in the cheek. "I'm hungry, lets get some waffles". Jesse bit Brock on the nose and called him Poindexter. Walt became jealous so he carjacked Jesse and drove to find Mike. Mike was taking a dump at the park with his granddaughter. "And this is how a rhino takes a dump", the elderly man said to the child, before the ♥♥♥♥ came onto her face. Walt farted all over them and forced them into the car. Meanwhile at the police station, Walt's brother in law Hank Shrader was smoking cigars on the toilet and practicing his laugh. Suddenly, Steve ran in. "Is it time for sex already", he mumbled as he reached for the toilet paper. "No honey, your brother on law Walt is Heisenberg! And he's kidnapped everyone for a surprise orgy!" Hank put on his Superman outfit and ran to the Mystery Machine. "Good work Scoob", he said to Steve as he patted his Latino head. Walt then picked up Gus's corpse from the graveyard and used voodoo magic to bring him back to life. "Yo that's cool ♥♥♥♥♥", said Jesse. "Get back to work", said Gus. "I already started", Walt replied as he began a nauseating zombie orgy whilst driving near a cliff. Hank Shrader was behind Walt, but not literally. That only happened in Walt's dreams. "Come out with your hands up Walt, I know everything!" Walt said "♥♥♥♥ YOU FATASS IM STILL DRIVING". Hank taunted Walt and said "I ate Hollie before you got a chance to!" Walt screamed "YOU ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥♥", before swerving around and crashing into the Mystery Machine. Then Walt ♥♥♥♥ed everyone involved, and Marie too since she tried to steal everything at the scene. Then Gretchen and Elliot showed up and Walt ate them. Whole. They tasted like zucchini. Pleased with his massive twelve way orgy, Walt and Jesse tongue kissed while jumping off a cliff in a Tweety costume. "I love Yogi Bear's dad", they sang as they hit the rocks. "♥♥♥♥♥", Jesse said before his head went to smithereens. Walt ran back home, where his home was gone. Looking at the ready meat of Skyler and Walter Junior, he realized he could have gotten the names from Lydia. Then he farted poo water into his pants and ate it. The End.","December 22, 2014","false","0.5"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","3","12","0","0"

I played the original for countless hours when I was younger. It has solid RTS mechanics, only slightly below the titan RTS game of AOE2. On top of that it adds a ton. There are a large number of ages, giving the game Civ-like "epic" feel. On top of that, the game has Civ-style wonders that provide passive benefits. The campaigns are extremely solid, with a Risk-style strategic map that allows you to move armies between territories, mount attacks, secure bonus resources, strengthen your territories, sabotage others' and even place World Wonders in safe locations to boost your attacks and defenses across the globe. The game is incredible.\n\nNow... the relaunch. I was super psyched that this game came to Steam. I immediately launched the Conquer the World campaign, only to find it riddled with problems. From graphical and sound bugs, to unbearably laggy performance. I have the game alt-tabbed while writing this and for the first time in 10years I see my typed text appear asychronous with my actual input. I'll turn the graphic settings down next time, because I hadn't really noticed them anyway.\n\nThis relaunch is a poor, poor effort. I was glad it came relatively quickly after its announcement, but that turned out to be a mistake.","June 13, 2014","false","51.1"," 56 of 125 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","56","125","0","4"

Sadly, I was disappointed. Rise of Nations adds many new features that expand on the work started by its spiritual predecessor, the Age of Empires series, but sadly fails to create enough variety in gameplay to keep things interesting for long. Units die quickly and have annoyingly stupid behavior that makes them difficult to control, so combat lacks strategic finesse and usually relies on constantly building more units. This seems like this would require skills in economic micromanagement, but the economy is also overly simple and automated, so no part of the gameplay really carries much excitement. The civilizations are all generally the same, so the game gets old fast.\n\nFans of the original Age of Empires series are better off with superior titles like Age of Mythology or Age of Empires 3 with all the expansions, which both offer more replayability and strategic depth. RoN's saving grace is its campaign maps, but games like Total War and Dawn of War have similar features with better combat to mix things up.","November 23, 2014","false","3.0"," 5 of 17 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","5","17","0","5"

That means a huge blow to any sort of immersiveness. There are 8 epochs/ages, but WW1, WW2 and late cold war equivalents are terrible. Bad aircraft control even compared to its predecessors.\n\nAlso, when you are past age 2, and have docks, all land units cross water by turning into transport ships so any sort water blocking access means nothing, except that subs sink each transport in 1 volley,\n\nThe game is more complex and it is actually very good apart from combat. It is one of the worst games I played, if not the worst. If you enjoy the very narrow rock paper scissors with non-RL connections, then you might enjoy it.\n\nDo not expect that this game is as good as others say. It has its qualities but fails very hard in other ways. Unless you can succesfully install mods that work and change the downsides I mentioned, I do not recommend this game to anyone with tastes similar to mine, which you can understand from my text.\n\nSo, no I did not wait to play this game for 12 years, I simply stumbled upon it, tested it long enough before it became extremely boring, so no, if you dont have the nostalgia infatuation, this game will quickly turn you down. The last 3 ages are just bad on top of all.","May 29","false","24.6"," 0 of 7 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","7","0","0"

When I saw this on sale I was pretty excited for a trip down nostolgia lane. But unfortunately this thing has not aged well, and it has revealed that it isn't a game so much as an chore to be optimized.\n\nIts overly complex in what you need to keep track of, you need to simultaneously be researching key technology at a library while expanding new cities, keeping your military updated with the newest weaponry, building resource-efficiency buildings, researching efficiency upgrades at said buildings, building new workers, building a military to begin with, and expanding your commerce with trading with your other cities. This isn't even taking into account the building of wonders or tactical combat, or the specialization of what troops to build in what quantities.\n\nIt's a massive headache to play, even on easy difficulties. And even when you win, it's unsatisfying. In my most previous game, I ended up building wonders to boost my empire, and appearently that starts a timer which at the end of you just straight up win. And then you're back to the main menu. Now I know you can probably turn that off as a setting, but the anti-climactic end to about 45 minutes of pretty intense micromanagement of a realtime empire is frustrating.\n\nIt's just too complex. Too much. I recognize that the individual features of the game are probably solid, but its inpenetrable. I do like other turn-based strategy games like StarCraft II, Civilization, and Age of Wonders 3, so its not the genre, but this particular realtime strategy game is getting a pass from me.","August 28, 2014","false","4.0"," 3 of 15 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","3","15","0","2"

The units and villagers in particular cannot even walk on the paths through buildings.... but they have to walk ALL the way around the buildings to get to the other side. The fighting animations are dreadful. I personally  think age of Empires is better. This game was decent maybe 7 years ago when it first game out. Although being just as old, age of empires has got better graphics to my perspective. I wish i could get a refund as i could have got something a lot better for 20 dollars.

I was never a fan of the Age of Empires games because of the lack of national borders, which i felt were quite an important aspect of nation states! This game tho takes the style of AoE and adds many features that make it imo far better. The creator of this game was a team member of Civ2 and Alpha Centari and that was a selling point for me when i first bougt it as im an avid fan of both of those. This reboot by SkyBox is wonderful and i love that they left the core code and gameplay intact but brought up the dated textures. My only point of discontention here is that Big Huge failed to capitalize of this great game and make another(i know RoN:rise of legends but dont like the fantasy aspect)\n\nAll in all I will highly recommend this game as one of my top 5 games of all time!!","January 18, 2015","true","12.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Rise of Nations was released in 2003, with an expansion a year-or-so later, and this Steam edition combines both of these into a neat package with some graphical upgrades, workshop support, and some minor new features like the ability to stream directly to Twitch. A cool package, overall, and it has dipped to good prices during sales.\n\nRise of Nations plays like some kind of hybrid freak-baby between the Age of Empires games and Civilization. RTS gameplay is mixed in with some grand strategic elements like territory control, and if you play the campaign, you'll be treated to a big board game-esque map. Games are spread out across eight ages, from the ancient times to the information age. You'll start off slinging rocks, move on to swords and iron, eventually drive some tanks, and then you'll be launching nukes and stealth bombers. There are also a ton of customization options for skirmishes, ranging from old fashioned 1v1s, all the way to massive free for all games with special rulesets. You can dive in and customize games to your liking, eliminating certain victory conditions or even making the entire game a peaceful tech race. The nearly absurd amount of customization options are also well-documented in a simple way, making it very easy to digest exactly what each individual setting is. You can very easily set a game up in almost any fashion you want. There are a wide variety of AI options too, all of which are well explained so you know exactly what you'll end up playing against.\n\nI've always had a special place in my heart for RTS games - a cold, dark, unexplored place, that I don't like to venture to because I'm competitive in stupid ways. I've ragequit from many a Starcraft game because I rallied my workers wrong or something. Rise of Nations, however, scratches an itch that no other RTS can seem to reach, and it keeps me coming back time and time again. There is such a wide variety of things that can occur in a single game, from skirmishes with a bunch of javelins and horses to patrolling the seas with submarines, or sending planes on bombing missions over the enemy capital, managing your supply trucks to avoid attrition damage, managing spies, decoys, exploration... it's a really deep and packed game that manages to hit all the right targets and miss all the wrong ones. There are some balance issues, such as Germany being ungodly good in all things economical, but for the most part you won't notice these things unless you start trying to obsessively min/max your gameplay style... and if you're the kind of gamer looking for a min/max competitive RTS, you are better off moving to Starcraft 2 or something.\n\n\nIt's well worth a purchase at almost any price point if you're looking for a unique take on the RTS genre.\n\nSeriously though, just pick Germany. Your economy will spiral out of control and the next thing you know, you are sending infantry against a bunch of guys with spears and there's something strangely satisfying about that.","November 26, 2014","true","69.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This isn´t age of empires II, why is this on steam? well, let me tell you all, that this, it is an awesome game. although my play history on steam shows a pity amount of time spent on this game, I have played the hell out if Rise of nations on the cd fromat, since it was only recently added to steam.\n\nWhat is this "Rise of nations" then? well, Rise of nations is your usual RTS game (Real time strategy) and it is the old "gather materials, Make people and soldiers, advance and conquer" quite the normal rooster of mechanichs. what really differs this game from other games I have played (keep in mind i haven´t played all RTS games) is that the game has alot of mechanics and features that make the game really feel like you´re creating and advancing.\nE.g. is that the game has a feature with reasearch, basicaly, there are multible routes to develop in, economy, warfare, popuation and sience . this really changes the way you "advance through the game. that means you don´t just upgrade your army and then destroy the enemy base in one go with only kind of troops, instead you might find it better to upgrade your economy and simply "starve" the enemy out by being able to consistently attack the enemy.\nA very nice feature that i found amazing, was the idea, that when "creating" a offensive unit, it gives you a platoon instead of a single unit, which makes the end game end (lol) in a enoumrus fight against highly numbered armies.\nGoing back to the advancement, the game lets you advance from the culture age all the way up to modern age where you fight with rockets, tanks and jets.\nalso, the game has a feature, where you have a relation to other nations/players. this means that you can be netrual, allied, friendly or in war with other nations and you can, during a game, ally with another player.\n\nThe game, of course, isn´t flawless. E.g. is that the game is from 2003, which means, that the game has it´s limits, althoug the steam version is better, so the grapichs isn´t explecitly amazing. futhermore,  the terrain might seems a bit dull and it is quite easy to do a fast rush if you play a certian nation.\nAll in all, this is, imo, a really great RTS game and it hold a certian nostalgic fealing to me.\nI hope that you found it just slightly useful - WIlhelm","November 20, 2014","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
