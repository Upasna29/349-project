You might not like it, but it won't make you angry that you wasted $0.99 on it.\n\nPros:\n- Decent graphics\n- Good atmosphere\n- Gameplay concept is quite alright\n\nCons:\n- No story, well, actually there is, but the way it's told is very amateurish. "At least they tried", I said.\n- The gameplay is bad, it depends purely on luck. There is no "playing" at all.\n\nJust my 2 cents, perhaps they can change it into texas poker. The "bluff" system is as ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as any poker games out there. Need better AI to feel the gamble.\n\n\nI'll recommend this for now, maybe they'll try to optimise the game. It has rooms to improve and looks promising on paper.","February 16","true","6.6"," 29 of 35 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","29","35","2","0"

For those who don't know the rules - there is every card twice in the deck, except one, Lamia. Players take one card from opponent and match pairs of cards in hand until only the Lamia is in hand of any player - and that player loses.\n\nIn real life, this game revolves a lot around bluffing (fun and easy enough game to play it children) so even there is a sort of bluffing - as you can do specific emotions when opponents are picking a card from your hand. Every opponent will react differently to your emotions, some will get confused because of your grinning, some because of you'll be telling them to draw quickly.\n\nThe game, considering the low pricetag, has a nice artworks, especially for the cards. Sadly, if you are going to be playing the English version (which I assume), expect a terrible translation from original Japanese version. There are many typing errors and sentences that feel weird - it's sad that developers didn't pay a proper translator, I think it could justify increase of price to two euros.\n\nWith bad translation interest in the story goes off, and then there's just the repeating card game that's fun for one or two times, but not fun to play ten games in a row. Even though it's a cheap game and it has nice artworks, I don't think at all it could be worth recommending.\n\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","March 2","false","4.4"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","22","25","0","0"

Unfortunately you have to win 4 times in each of the 11 levels but don't loose more than 2 times. You win if the bad joker doesn't remain in your card deck. So it's totally luck based. You choose cards from other players and they choose randomly from you. Your only chance is a bluff which can be used 3 times until it's depleted.

Lamia's Game Room is a mystery card game that plays [for me] similar to Old Maid, with a visual novel type story tied to it. It's a bit short, it took me about 4-5 hours to beat and get all of the achievements. At the time I played, spelling and grammatical errors plauged the entire game.\n\nThe game is all about fooling your opponent by playing your cards and when you can, expressions right. You got a "Lamia" card you need to get your opponent to take and hold onto, so they "lose." I focued more on the gameplay then the story, though I didn't feel it very interesting.The levels starting out were rather simple, easy to catch on and get into the rhythm. Towards the end, the characters you're playing against get a lot better and their factial give aways are no longer always accurate.\n\nI recommend this on I enjoyed the gameplay and goth-style art, though this game is NOT for everyone.","April 2","true","4.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Although the premise involves 'finding out your opponents' weakness', that really only works until halfway through the game. After that point, the patterns of each opponent are so vague you have a better chance just doing random guesses.\n\nThe translation is terrible, but at least it's still comprehensible most of the time. The story is nonexistent.  Whenever it feels like a character is getting some development or the game is hinting to something you jump right into the next chapter and that's never mentioned again.\n\nSpoiler alert, if you manage to brave through 11 short but boring as hell matches, your big reward is a 'to be continued' screen as the game ends without even trying to explain anything about the plot it pretends to have. And that's just lovely.","March 4","false","3.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hawkzombie/recommended/434680/","hawkzombie","Hawk Zombie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hawkzombie/","1550 products in account","So, this is basically a visual novel that is poorly translated (or written, maybe both), and uses the Old Maid game mechanic.\n\nAt times even if you feel you have a read on your opponent's tell you'll still pick the wrong card, and there will be times no matter what you do you'll end up losing. This can work in your favor sometimes: I was in the clear on the first turn, as 4 of my 5 cards were matches, and my opponent to my left was the first to pick cards, thus eliminating my hand. It still feels very RNG-ish, however, which can be a bad for something like this.\n\nIf the 'tells' were a little more visual or if they said something you could make an educated guess from that would be a big improvement. There were several times I had to win four games in a row and lost on my fourth game due to sheer luck. Very frustrating.\n\nTo be honest, while the story had its issues, it was the only reason I kept playing. It isn't a BAD game per say, just not very well put together.\n\nHOWEVER, I am going to recommend this because of the price. The art is great, it has a creepy atmosphere, and you genuinely want to know more about the story. Plus, achievements simply for playing and beating the game (nothing missable). Worth it.","February 18","true","4.5"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

I was also enjoying the art style. Unfortunately there is almost nothing in this game that is enjoyable. The english was garbage, the whole game is covered in misspellings and grammer mistakes. The gameplay had no depth to it whatsover,  When the character's face shows the tell, it is the bad card, pick any other card. using that strategy, I was able to win everytime, except for 2 times, with there being about 10 card games* or so, makes the gameplay so boring.\n\nThe story is also horrible and non-existent. The game tries to be mysterious, and will after the occasional chapter, try to drop a "clue" like a mysterious family photo or something. They are for the most part, literally useless, they have no impact on anything. As someone who can get subtlety and can find hidden meanings, I can assure you there are none here. One last thing about the story, there is an extra chapter "twist", when viewed under the conversations of the rest of the game, actually creates some plotholes and was a clearly rushed ending.\n\nSo yeah, nothing really in this game is good, go get anything else.\n\n*The matches themselfs require 4 wins minimum, and you lose and restart if you lose twice. While this does make luck less of a deciding factor, it drags out the matches for soooooo long. When I was doing a quick mental recount, I could have sworn there were more card games in this than that, but nope, they are just really long. For someone who likes the card game it might be better, but for me who hated it, it was a real chore and dragged on and on.","April 6","false","2.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Finally beat the game and got all the achievements and the game is crap plain and simple. Not a huge piece of crap but crap nonetheless. I love the games art and aesthetic their both good but that's just about all the game has going for it.\n\nThe game is basically old maid where you seek to avoid having the old maid card (lamia card) in your hand by the end of the game. You'd think it would be an ok game being based off of a classic but the game here is played out in the most stressful and overbearing way possible forcing you to win 4 GAMES IN A ROW just to pass to the next chapter.\n\n-I would say it's an entirely luck based game, I WOULD, if only the game didn't cheat half of the time. At first i wasn't sure whether a luck based rng game would have been worse than a game that cheats. Stupid thought on my part because obviously a game that cheats like this in this sort of game is worse. I can't count how many times I've picked a card from the middle of my opponents hands only to be given another completely different card which is always the lamia card causing me to lose an otherwise winning game. And once you loose you have to play that match 4 MORE TIMES OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER SOMETIMES MORE if you lost once in the match.\n\n-The story itself is crap too. You only get a few answers to what's happening and the ending is nonexistant. Not to mention that the dialogue is in bad english. Weird grammar and broken sentences everywhere. They need to get a new translator if they ever do a sequel.\n\n-Also just found out that this is a cellphone game. I'm not sure which came first but if the app did I can understand why everything was subpar on pc.\n\nSubpar game not ULTRA horrible but they really need to fix the english, and stop the ai from cheating. The story HAS potential and they should focus on making it better in a future sequel.\n\n4/10 You get what you pay for and for this price it's fine.","April 24","false","5.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Plus, it had trading cards to sell.\n\nWhat I got is not what I was looking for. As written in the other reviews, it is not a VN, but a simple card game based on luck.\n\nThe story is awkward and cringeworthy, the English translation is terrible, and more often than not, the artwork is not pretty.\n\nOn a technical note, the game has a little reaction delay: where Ren'Py VNs react instantaneously on mouse clicks, this game takes a fraction of a second before it reacts. It's not much, but it's there and enough to annoy me.\nOn a 4:3 or 5:4 resolution, you cannot run the game in fullscreen without the graphics being stretched vertically - even although it is done in Unity, which allows extensive resolution configuration.\nApparently, this game only comes with 64 bit support. Seriously? There's NOTHING in the whole game that requires a 64 bit CPU. Even an old (32 bit) 500 MHz machine should be able to handle what is presented here. I can only speculate what might be the cause of this. Most likely, it's bad design.\n\nFor me, this seems like a quick cash grab.\n\nAvoid.

I honestly had doubts before pushing the "buy" button when I read the mixed reviews, I wasn't sure if this would be good enough, granted that impulse purchasing has always failed me one way or another, but boy- aren't I glad I YOLO'd this. I guess it's part of the gamble, huh?\n\nAs mentioned by other reviews, this game is played out just like Old Maid and your goal is to fool your opponents by playing your cards right, per se. All the cards were designed to symbolize the 7 sins (Pride, Wrath, Gluttony, Sloth, Lust, Envy, Greed), which sort of foreshadows the characters in a way. Alongside with an extra "Lamia Card", basically the Joker that you need to get rid of, if you ever find one landing on your hands. You have Suspic/Doubt (pretend to be suspicious), Nervo/Nervou (pretend to be nervous), Grin (literally), 3 reactions to trick your opponents into picking the Lamia Card, which is only available if you got one on your hands. It was quite easy at first, as soon as I found the pattern it was a breeze rushing through the chapters. At the later on chapters though, namely the last few rounds took me one or two tries to get through, because the opponents stopped reacting the way I thought they would and their poker faces fooled me quite a few times.\n\nI'm not a fan of card games, but this game definitely takes the cake out of all the others I've played. The story was told in such a way that resembles the Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors series and Sweet Fuse ~By Your Side~ (And especially the anime, Death Parade!). It gave off of this feeling that left me crossing my fingers and panicked whenever I failed to trick the others. It engaged me into feeling like I was in that room, playing by Lamia's rules, and that I had to do my best to help The Player (The main character) to escape this madness.\n\nAt most times, I don't appreciate open ended games with incomplete story, I guess that's just my preference. This game had exactly that, it dropped hints here and there, sometimes an important piece of information could be found in dialogues, and at other times, it was those obvious evidences that were left behind by the previous round's losers. The game expects the player to gather up information, organize them and conclude them on our own. Granted, the game does lack on the delivery aspect, as most often than not, it expected a lot out of the player to have a good understanding of the plot, while init of itself isn't as clear as day. If you so desire to throw on your wool coat and whip out your thinking hat to play detective, then this game would prove to be quite enjoyable, at least by my standards. Although in the end, the game didn't explain everything exactly, even when the situation was understood, because of how enjoyable the game was, I anticipated for a sequel (or a prequel) to this (soon to be made?) series.","March 11","true","5.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

It is not big mistakes, but small stupid mistakes which could easily had been avoided, if the developer had checked one extra time or have someone fluent correct them.\nAnother (semi)failure is the bluffing-system which works as intended most of the time. I had a lot of trouble with it in the final chapter, and finally I won at my 12th attemped.\nIf you are into using your skills instead of luck in a game, this is NOT the game for you. And if you cannot ignore the problems with the grammar and the bluffing system you should stay away from the game too..\n\nThe GOOD things about the game is the art. This was the pure reason for my purchase. At some points ingame I was even a little spooked by the art, which is a HUGE PLUS in my opinion!\nAnd then I personally like the game "Old Maid", or whatever you english-people call it. In Denmark it is named "Sorteper", and it woked a lot of fond memories from my childhood.\n","February 29","false","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The premise is simple, you have to continously play (and win) Lamia's game or you'll die. The gameplay revolves around you constantly picking random cards from your opponent's hand, hoping that the RNG favors you, no strategy required (or available).\n\nPro:\n-Low price.\n-Nice art and music.\n\nCon:\n-RNG\n-1 billion obvious typos (Cancle, frist...)\n-Translation is as good as a seahorse's foam soaked face. Like seriously, we're talking about cavemen level conversations. "Me want smash you" "GUHGUHGUH"\n\nFor the low price of 1 buck, it's alright... but I can't recommend this game, at least until most of the typos plaguing this horrible localization are gone. It really is immersion breaking.","February 19","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game truly failed to do what it set out to do so, make a simple but fun card game, however, instead, what we got is a long exercise in luck and random number generating. The game itself works so terribly, there's no way to control what the AI chooses, causing for it to be an unfun mess, the commands also, either work or don't work, and there is no pattern! No game should rely on luck alone, games are made to be an exercise in memory, motor skills and hand-to-eye co-ordination. Don't play this game if you're looking for something of that nature.","February 20","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"
