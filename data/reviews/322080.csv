The imagery is    a pixelated delight and the music and sound effects  add substance to the artwork.  Disorder is a creepy atmospheric platformer the like of which I've not come across before.

Navigate zany, topsy-turvy worlds to help him find them again!\n\nActually: Disorder is a grim platformer based on slow, precise jumps and the ability to switch between two slightly different versions of the world.  Expect to jump from a platform that exists towards empty air, switch worlds, and land on a new one.\n\nPros:\n- Great level design.\n- Challenging and interesting puzzles.\n- Solid exploration of the world switching mechanic.\n- Good replay value.  There are multiple endings, branching paths, and every hidden item you unlock can be "enabled" to add a challenging effect to gameplay.  (Think the gods in Bastion, or the limiters in Transistor.)\n- I encountered no bugs on my first playthrough, which is not something I say a lot.\n- The trick of the last level is pretty clever.\n\nAccording to taste:\n-  Tries very hard to keep a dark, gloomy atmosphere.  Let me put it like this:  I can imagine a depressed late-teen to early twenties person writing everything that the main character says in their diary.  That said, I wouldn't go out of my way to read that diary.\n- Some polarity switching games have very distinct flavors for the two worlds (Giana Sisters comes to mind).  Disorder switches between sad and agonized, or drab and creepy.  As a result, the two worlds aren't easily identifiable: at any given time, I couldn't tell you which one I was in.  This didn't bother me at all, but it was sort of unexpected.\n- Balanced around a slower character with a short jump.\n\nCon:\n- Pretty short.  I beat this game in 1.5 hours.  There could have easily been another few levels and at least one more major mechanic.\n- There should really be some sort of visible indicator of whether or not you're blocked from shifting.  I'd put an icon on the screen, but if the dev is really committed to not having a HUD, do something with the main character's facial expression instead.  The constant, cartoonish frown was a bit much.\n\nOverall, a good and innovative game, but I wish there were more of it.","January 13, 2015","true","21.4"," 36 of 40 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","36","40","2","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aprofilehere/recommended/322080/","aprofilehere","Gunderson Mallard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aprofilehere/","2359 products in account","Grieving is hard to do.\n\nDisorder is a puzzle platformer with a strong narrative focus. The mechanics of the game begin with duality (think "timef cu k" among others), but adds some more dynamics as it goes including the necessity of crouching, inversions, dodging projectiles and more. As puzzle platformer, it is demanding and very well made. The solution and execution of each puzzle grows more complex as the game sinks further into the darkness of despondency.\n\nAside from the core mechanics, cursory elements add more to the experience. Most puzzle platformers tend to be linear with a single solution, but Disorder eschews this with branching level design. It feels strange to narrowly escape from one puzzle sequence, only to look back and see that there are other ones that remain untouched and, now, unreachable, Some routes felt easier than others, but that's possibly because the more strenous route held a hidden trinket. These trinkets can be used to modify the game after completion and range from making your character float, or slip, to inverting the world. Finding and using these trinkets adds more replay value and challenge to the game.\n\nAlong with being intellectually taxing, Disorder weighs heavily on the spirits. Dealing with sensitive topics requires great finesse. At the center of the game is a young man grieving, with different facets emerging from broken homes to suicide. Putting these complicated feelings into a game is no small feat, and Disorder does not hold back. The text of the game relentlessly peels away at the layers. Text pops up throughout the game, written across levels, repeating some sentences that are then saved in the journal. Swapping dimensions will morph these repeating sentences into a different set that, again, are saved into the journal. The deliberate pacing of the story relies on the player sitting still long enough to read both sets of monologue. The story can be difficult to stomach sometimes and every line only adds to this. The conclusions are powerful, and the player is forced to decide how the story ends.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that Disorder isn't without its flaws. Though the controls work well (essential for platformers), I found that there were some framrate issues which led to some frustration. Although I much prefer a game to end too quick rather than drag on, some people measure a game's quality by its length. In that regard, Disorder is on the shorter side, and if you are not up to finding the hidden items then the journey can end to quick for some. Another factor to consider is how many platformers you have played. Sure, everyone's played Mario, but even the most interesting of mechanics in platforming can be found in flash games. With that said, dodging projectiles and hopping on disappearing platformers with two characters in an inverted level that changes behavior with dimension might just be old tricks for some.\n\nDisorder is an astounding accomplishment. It manages to feel rewarding and new in a saturated genre both in gameplay and story. However none of these things change the fact that it is emotionally draining. This is truly an unsettling and unforgettable experience, despite some minor flaws.","July 1, 2015","true","6.5"," 19 of 19 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","19","19","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingsigy/recommended/322080/","kingsigy","KingSigy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingsigy/","526 products in account","Depression is a lot more common than people realize. You probably know someone who is battling depression or has a relative with the disorder. I know that the past 12 years of my life were filled with it, ruining my college experience and nearly crippling me with anxiety and fear.\n\nThat a game like "Disorder" exists just makes me happy. I get nearly tear-filled when I see that a developer was brave enough to tackle subject matter that most designers would shake off. While the game doesn't go as far as I might have liked, the vague questions and platitudes make for some compelling writing that really sticks out for me, personally.\n\nThese thoughts have all crossed my mind at one time or another. You may not know much about the main character, but to see, "I'm not really worth it," cross his mind just reminds me of the hardships I faced to get through my mental illness. It is something that never leaves you, but you learn to cope.\n\nThe mechanics of the game seem to reflect that. Your character switches between a duality of light and dark. While this isn't exactly original, the story set-up makes the idea very interesting. The graphics also sell the dark atmosphere and sad setting.\n\nThe game is all about embracing your darkness and moving on with it. There is no sense in sticking to one emotion at all times. You will get nowhere in life, much as this game. You may come up to a dead-end, but switching around polarities can reveal another path.\n\nThis also lends some non-linearity to the level design. For a platformer to include more than one path is pretty damn excellent. Hidden items are often on those paths, but I did manage to find a couple that were purely alternative routes (often harder, too).\n\nThe enemies are limited, but each work within the games mechanics. There are dots which reverse their output with polarity changes. Enemies will fire in one direction while in light versus dark. There are some anti-gravity beams that will push or pull you, based on polarity. It makes for some great scenarios, even if a lot of them have been done before.\n\nThe game is incredibly short, so it never overstays it's welcome. I personally know a lot of the guys from Screwattack, so I know this was intentional. They were born and raised on NES games that didn't waste time. I believe "Disorder" could have used some more difficulty, but replaying the game for alternate paths (or endings) sounds like a very tantilizing prospect.\n\nWhen I said that I didn't feel the game went far enough with it's premise, it was mostly in how little there is to the story. You are never explicitly told what the main character is going through. This makes some of the later "revelations" a bit soft. The full impact could have been extracted had there been some more background.\n\nI also think that the very final level is a bit of a cop-out. I will avoid spoiling it, but dying and restarting at checkpoints pretty much negates the challenge. One section did trip me up, but it was mostly down to timing my button presses. Apart from that, you can pretty much breeze through the end game.\n\nThe price tag is also a little steep. I can see that it was lowered to $10, but I'm not sure if that is fair. I fairly enjoyed the game and would recommend it to people looking for something unique, but the length doesn't seem to justify the asking price. Maybe wait for a half-off sale (I did).\n\nWhenever you decide to take the plunge, know that "Disorder" is a very good game. Tackling darker themes and presenting mind-bending puzzles has given us a platformer that feels very different, despite borrowing heavily from it's predecessors. I wouldn't hesitate to say that this should be played by everyone (even if it's not A+ material).\n\n7.5/10","March 27, 2015","true","3.6"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

But Escape has its function, it switches the game from fullscreen to windowed mode.

On the keyboard you use the WASD for movement and the spacebar to switch between light and dark. Controls are intuitive and responsive which is required in a puzzle platformer to make sure its you who didn't time that jump right and not the fault of the games controls.\n\nAt it's core, Disorder is a puzzle platformer that has one major unique design feature. The game is all about duality, in essence the duality of the mind. On one hand you have the more positive side of the mind, the stable side, the side that sees positivity, the proverbial silver lining. The other is the negative side, the side of you could say each person's personality that sees only despair and negativity. This translates into a core mechanic that allows you to switch between light and dark which changes the game world around you. Some platforms can only be access while in the dark state and vice versa, creatures who will kill you in the dark state become harmless objects in the light state. The game implements the use of this mechanic in all forms of its being including puzzles, platforming and narrative.\n\nThe main purpose of each level is to go through and collect marbles which are also used as checkpoints. While I am certain it is a reference to losing ones marbles, the story is the reason the marbles are used. Each marble has what appears to be a cerebral nerve, a brain nerve if you will at the centre. Each level seems to reflect either a memory or delusion from the main characters mind. At the end of each level you'll reach a giant marble and your character will seemingly fall in despair, clawing at his skin and the disintegrate, almost showing his progression into madness.\n\nI always say that one of the most important things for a puzzle platformer to have by design is a progression of mechanics and thus difficulty. As you go through the game, making existing mechanics more challenging and the introduction of new mechanics is vital in this genre. Disorder has this in leaps and bounds, not only is there a progression of mechanics from floating platforms, traps and other traditional mechanics but there is also some mechanics that help reflect the theme of the game. After all your main character mind is fracturing, becoming more disturbed as he tries to internally resolve his issues. One of the interesting mechanics is when you come across a reflective surface on the ground, by then phase shifting you become that reflection, which makes you upside down. Its the little quirky mechanics like this with the addition of platforming, traps, enemies, timing, the increasing difficulty and complexity of levels added with the phase shifting that makes the game play fun, challenging and worth while.\n\nOne particular level I both loved and hated was the level which becomes black as night. The only way to gain light is by movement. Anything that has movement including objects will give off sound waves that light up the small area surrounding it. While I loved the concept of the new sound equals light mechanic, it did become frustrating when you got into a puzzle that require precision timing and you couldn't see a bloody thing. This coupled with the fact that the sound waves themselves were quite distracting and often led your eyes away from what you were actually doing was a nuisance.\n\nThroughout levels there are secrets to find including items that can be equiped by returning to your apartment which you can do from the pause menu. These items have a vareity of effects and will change the game play in some way such as boots that let you jump three times as high, almost like anti gravity boots.\n\nGraphically the game is great. The 2d pixel art looks good and the art style of the levels takes you to more abstract and surreal places as you delve further into the mind. The switch between light and dark is reflected tremendous well with the use of different colour pallets as well as a good use of lighting. The games musical score provides a great atmospheric tone that provide some really great moments. Both the music and sounds are very well produced and the music in particular does complement the game play and story to provide a unnerving immersive experience.\n\nFor me the star of the show is the narrative of the game. Like I mentioned the story is an ambigious one and everything that occurs can be interpreted in different ways. The story is told through the eyes of the main character and presented in text form while you play. As you move through the levels you'll see text appear like its being written in a diary. One thing I loved and I wish other developers would take a note from, its the fact the the story is integrated into the mechanics. Say your walking along and your in the light side of the duality mechanic, you'll see the text as the character talks about something, if you then phase shift and enter the dark side the text changes to the darker side of your character, the more negative thoughts on the subject. It's almost like getting two drastically different opinions, two opposing viewpoints on something from the same person. It's similar to reading the diary of someone with spilt personality, or someone who suffers from depression.\n\nThe game in both good writing and in its mechanics tells a narrative. Not only are you reading the thoughts of someone who is clearly going through a very rough time but your playing it. The duality mechanic helps you to feel the characters internal struggle when you shift by showing the change in sound, light, colours and overall tone. This is what good video game design is all about. Its about having mechanics that complement the story and vice versa, all aspects of the game should tell an overall narrative.\n\nOverall what I really like about Disorder is that not only its narrative but its quality. You could get through the game without getting the secrets and such in around three to four hours. There is more than one ending so there is some re-playability in there too, though not much. Instead trying to overreach as many indie developers do they instead opted to go for quality over quantity. Whether you like puzzle platformers or not, the quality of the narrative alone is worth trying the game out. The mechanics are solid, the story is through provoking and ultimately its a fun and interesting puzzle platformer.","January 13, 2015","true","4.5"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","2"

Controls are tight and responsive, and the story while confronting in places, is still a pleasure to experience. The only let down for me is the short play length, but the time I spent in each level I still enjoyed. Disorder is a great indie title and has earned 7.5 out of 10.\n\nDisorder is the first game developed by Swagabyte Games, a small indie studio operating remotely from various cities in the U.S. I am a big fan of games that take on adult themes, like mental illness, and was immediately drawn in by the tale of the protagonist.\n\nThe player on game start up is thrown straight into the control seat, and starts to unravel the story behind the young man. Disorder has an emotional story to tell, that is portrayed well throughout the levels. I won't go into any more detail about the story, as it’s the reason to play this game, but I will say, after only a short time I felt completely submerged in this young man's struggle.\n\nBoiled down, Disorder is a 2D puzzle/platformer, which uses one mechanic of swapping between positive and negative worlds to challenge the player. This swap world mechanic feels fresh in this psychological setting, and when applied on the different objects in the world has a varying effect. Moving from positive to negative, will freeze some platforms, reverse the movement of others, convert enemies to jump pads and generally change the landscape.\n\nThe story that is delivered in small scenes with floating text, is also affected by the negative, positive swap. Be sure to take the time to swap during these story scenes, as it is extremely interesting seeing the two perspectives. Disorder's level design on the whole is good, and I had a great time, taking on every challenge the devs threw at me. The play length is a little short at under 2 hours, but the collectables in each level may extend the game life for some players.\n\nI have a weak spot for retro visuals, so Disorders pixel art style was right up my alley. The levels look amazing and really help to convey the emotion of the memory it represents. Even with this pixel art style I found the gestures and animations of the protagonist very powerful, and I never quite got used to seeing the young man die. The music is another great addition, and provides the perfect atmosphere throughout the game.\n\nFor my full review and heaps of other delicious content see Glitch","January 18, 2015","true","3.8"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

It sends you into a psychological spin as you try to negotiate it's twisted world.\n\nYou play the part a disturbed young boy who has created a world in his own mind and can switch between the 'real' world and the world from his memory. I'm not sure if that is a reflection of the developers collective mind or not but it's not a world I'd want to visit in real life.\n\nThe graphics are 2D pixel art with particular attention to detail and I love the use different palettes for the two realms. The white noise planet/moon and clouds in the background create a stark world in which we can't help but feel a sense of helpless solitude.\n\nThe music and SFX are haunting and help to nail the graphics into your sub-conscience. I think the soundtrack is available to download from their website (link below).\n\nThe developers have done a marvellous job on this game and it's not one I would attempt myself.

The projected gameplay mechanics looked really quite interesting and unique, and I must say that I am very much into psychological and puzzle games.\n\nUnfortunatley though, my excitement was in vain. I was lucky that I got this in a sale for around £2 I think, because frankly, the normal price of £6.99 is way too high for a two hour game. Sure the developers released an expansion pack, but those levels are simply a bit too difficult.\n\nHowever, as a review, I think that it is best that I start with what I DID like about the game. In honesty, not much really. I liked how the family members and the other characters from his past were portrayed in his head. If in the light, there were stick figures with a somewhat bubbly animation, while in the dark they were shadows with creepy animations. Some were really creepy in the dark section. For example, one person was banging his head on a window. Thing is, my character was blocking my view of this and when I moved, he gave me a jump. I thought the music was quite charming when in the light, but it felt like it was either the same or very similar pieces of music throughout the entirety of the game, meaning that I lost interest in the music over time. Finally, the eerie feel of the game made the game quite creepy, thus drawing me into what was going to occur next.\n\nUnfortunatley, what was bad about the game greatly outweighs what I felt was good about the game. First of all, The switching between light and dark was very interesting to begin with, but eventually it just got annoying on how much in interfered with the world around the character. Also the transitions between the two modes had a glitchy effect (which was understandably used as it portrays the character's fractured mind), which was just very distracting after a while and simply it affected gameplay too much, and also caused me to die various times.\n\nThere are levels where the map is pitch black and the only way to see is through pools of light that are emitted through either you, enemies or objects around you moving. This just hurts my eyes and makes it even harder to concentrate on playing the game. Then when there are no enemies or objects around you, you can't really see much of what is ahead of you and end up either progressing very slowly, or running into something bad that doesn't emit light.\n\nThe story was very vague and really quite confusing. It is shown through three or four sentences of monologue in certain places in the game. I say confusing because when you approach the area where the text is shown, it's not specifically the start of the section of the story, meaning that you not only have to wait for all of the sentences to be played, but also figure out which sentence makes the most sense to be the first. After you do that, you find out that you have to do it all over again when you switch to the light or dark...\n\nThe main character isn't the best protagonist, being very neutral with emotions. I think that they could have devoloped on movment animations as the slowness of it also affected the gameplay, particularly in the parts where you have to be quite quick.\n\nOverall, due to the amount of negativities, I would give this game a 4/10, but if you are still interested in getting it, I would highly recommend getting it in a sale.","January 5","false","2.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","43","3","7","2","1"

XD But getting back to the review. This is a puzzle platformer with a intresting story and takes on many dark subjects that all vary  from person to person so this might hit close to home for some people or to others it might be a intresting take on subject matter that they have never dealth with before.  either way it's a journey that was well worth it. My only complaint was that it was kinda short but there is some extras and hidden items and even a timed mode for those people who are competitive that will add more to the replay value. If your still not sure wait for a sale but reguardless I still 100% recomend picking this up.","March 15, 2015","true","3.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I was hoping for a story about depression to give me feels, but I got puzzles. This game could have done so much more.\n\nThe story text (what little story there is) is repeated over and over in specific areas of the game. If you are trying to get past a puzzle and text comes up, you're out of luck. Yes, this happens occasionally. It seems to me that the developers came up with a puzzle concept using duality, light and dark. Then they had to come up with a story to sell it. To me, it's just not compelling.","December 22, 2015","false","1.3"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

But here's the problem I never felt bad for our main character, because I could not relate with him, for people with depression you could but if anything this game should make you more depressed for the people with actual depression, and if you want to relate for this character but you don't have depression (say like me) than you're S.O.L. It's way to slow to do the simplest things, making the already atrociously cheap difficulty even more irritating. And to pour salt on the wound this was made by the same people who made AVGN Adventures. You know that fun, colorful, and visually stunning game (for what genre it is anyway), and while most would say that AVGN Adventures has cheap difficulty as well, it's actually rather fair becuase most of the time I blame me for failing multiple times not the game or it's controls, not to mention that it's a game featuring the nerd obvioulsly it's going to be difficult. But this game sucks all color, fun, and it all looks bland. So no I do not recommend this game for anybody who's expecting the same amount of quality of AVGN: Adventures. All in all very poor follow-up.","April 4, 2015","false","3.0"," 3 of 14 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","3","14","0","0"

The story might grind on you depending on your tolerance for people who are intensely deep in their own despair. I will warn you that the game might have framerate issues and bad slowdown once you get to certain areas that have lots of projectiles and effects going on. It gets worse if you're running it full screen.
