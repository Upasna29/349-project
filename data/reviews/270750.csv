This is the core of what hardcore old school RPGs used to be and why they were glorious but also frustrating at times.\n\nNo single superhuman adventurer battling through hordes of enemies - no man could be that powerful. Instead, you have a band of adventurers with real needs like hunger, thirst, illnesses, and broken equipment. Magical items? They are extremely rare and not the absolute destructive force they are in current fantasy games. Skills? Ha! Every skill you can think of you can upgrade, even ones you'll never use.\n\nAnd there in lies the beauty and the flaw. You, the grand guide, have to decide how you want to handle your adventurers. In current RPGs, such details have been reduced or even eliminated to improve the gaming experience. If the concept of handling the challenges of weather, terrain, illnesses, wear and tear of equipment, and your adventurers' needs immerses you into the game, then by all mean you should purchase this game and maybe even the whole trilogy. If such details sound tedious and aggravating, then pass by this game.\n\nBut I shall also provide a warning; it still contains the bugs that the originals contained. They are minor, but they can still be irritating. The biggest of which I always had to deal with is the step wise error when trying to complete a quest in the swamplands. You must turn it off to access the quest-required sunken chest. Lastely, when in doubt, do an internet search!","February 20, 2014","true","29.7"," 42 of 44 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","42","44","0","0"

World of Arkania is very alive and dynamic, beautiful artwork and fairy music, a lot of secrets to uncover and mysterys to reveal. I am very happy to see this game on steam........install now and become a part of the epic adventure.\n\nA bit late , but i reccomend to edit - dosboxrealms2.conf - this file can be found in the game directory, few lines have to be changed: scaler=advmame2x ; cycles=18000 . scaler makes picture a bit softer and 18000 cycles looks like the optimal speed.","January 11, 2014","true","13.1"," 39 of 44 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","39","44","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ClarityFV/recommended/270750/","ClarityFV","Clarity","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ClarityFV/","219 products in account","Star Trail follows in the tracks of the original game released two years earlier but is still different in several ways with the graphics and general gameplay being slightly more refined. It is possible to transfer the party of the original game over to Star Trail for an easier start along with their stats and most equipment. Different bugs depending on the game version can still make this annoying though as e.g. weapon skills can become messed up and the money gathered in RoA1 is generally greatly reduced.\n\nThe story is a continuation of the first game. One year has passed in Arkania since the heroes were able to thwart the orc attack on Thorwal. But not all is well as the vile creatures have instead turned their attention east and invaded and conquered the greater part of the Svellt City-League. As the heroes arrive they are given two tasks. For one they are supposed to find the Salamander Stone, an artifact created to commemorate the short-lived alliance of elves and dwarfs. The artifact might rekindle the old alliance and incite them to drive the orcs from the land. On the other the heroes ought to find the legendary throwing ax Star Trail – for mere monetary reasons.\n\nWith just the tiniest bits of information the hero party, consisting of up to six characters, is off to explore the lands. And at that point the game shows the first significant differences to the original. Walking through towns is now smooth and not a step-by-step process, greatly resembling the modern title ‘Legend of Grimrock’ minus the strafing. Buildings have various styles now, the map system was vastly improved and range weapons and spells can now be fired diagonally as well. Speech and small cut scenes were also included.\n\nWhile in RoA1 even the smallest village could be thoroughly explored in RoA2 this is only true for the six major cities and the dungeons. Smaller hamlets are just handled through text boxes where the heroes are given choices to e.g. visit the local inn or temple.\n\nTravelling through the world of Arkania is still done on a large map in form of a red line. Diseases are a constant threat in the game, caused by bites of wild animals or inappropriate camping equipment in harsh weather conditions. Food and water need to be found or the party will starve to death. In addition the shoes of a hero might be destroyed, making him lose precious health points with every step. While camping the heroes can attempt to gather herbs, food and water, perform healing talents and put up guards at night to avoid surprise attacks by the local wildlife or bandits. A handy in-game function lets you repeat these tasks as required and you do not have to set them manually every night as in RoA1.\n\nEver present are the death traps ranging from an ibex that likes to knock overly daring heroes off the mountain, a deadly fire spirit that needs well thought persuasion, to mobs that arrive with pitchforks and torches to end the heroes unless they carry the correct item to save them. For the most part the death traps are easier to avoid than in RoA1 though.\n\nCombat is done on an isometric grid with each character having an amount of points per round based on how much weight they carry. The less your character carries the more actions (attack, use items, use spells etc.) he will be able to perform. New is the helpful but risky auto-combat mode where the game calculates the outcome of the battle. As the game does not bother with well thought out tactics it is good to always keep an eye on your health and when things go wrong quickly return to manual combat before it might be too late. The auto-combat speeds up battles greatly though.\n\nSpells are still important in the game, both in combat and outside, but just like in the predecessor some spells are a waste, meaning they have no use in the game altogether while others can only be used meaningfully a single time in the entire trilogy. The same is true for certain talents. It is good advice to find a game guide telling which spells or talents should not be trained or precious points are wasted in never used talents like ‘riding’ or spells like 'AEOLITUS'.\n\nAll in all Star Trail is a vast improvement compared to RoA1 and probably the best of the series. It is still difficult, requires lots of micro management and one wrong move can mean death. The fact that the game gives you few hints as to what to do and where to go does not help. You need to explore a lot and talk to all the people you can meet, no matter how unimportant they seem, as they can still carry the important piece of information you need.\n\nStar Trail might turn many players away due to its age and antiquated style but it is a grand adventure worth remembering if you give it a chance.","May 29, 2015","true","26.0"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/infindima/recommended/270750/","infindima","A. Yeager","http://steamcommunity.com/id/infindima/","680 products in account","This game suffers from the same problems as the first game (the window becomes unbearably small when alt-tabbing), but this one has a feature which makes the game tedious. Instead of letting you save whenever you like, you have to go into the manual and find a certain word they point out. Such as "Go to page 34, on row 7, the 5th word." And the manual linked from Steam has been scanned, which makes it so that the pages don't appear on the page you expect it to. And going to the manual forces the game into the tiny playwindow. It does leave the game unbearable to continue.\n\nI guess this was an old method to prevent piracy, but it just punishes the customer. If the window wouldn't resize anytime you alt-tabbed, I might have given this game a chance. The manual is needed not only for saving, but to learn what all the icons in the game mean, as there is no tooltip.","April 15, 2014","false","1.0"," 28 of 67 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","28","67","0","3"

Based on the most popular, German PnP roleplaying game The Dark Eye (Das Scwarze Auge). Overall a very challenging game, but quite playable.\n\nCharacter creation and party-building is very hardcore, the complex rules aren't explained at all, even the spell descriptions[www.gog.com] are missing from the manual provided by the Steam version. The game however allows the player to skip the depth of this part and provides pre-generated characters as well as automated character creation and leveling.\n\nThe game features a medium-sized open-world with overland travel and camping. The world is dynamic, it reacts to the players' many choices and is very alive. It has about five, multi-level dungeons and five towns (one of these is quite big), each handcrafted with great attention to story detail and puzzles.\n\nDungeon-crawling is superb. Navigating is not too hard, due to an excellent automap, but knowing where to go and what to do is much more difficult, the player needs to pay attention to details and explore a lot.\n\nCombat takes place in an isometric, grid-based environment and in a few cases it can get quite big-scale, with up to 20 participants. These can take a bit too long and are boring, so the game features manual, auto and quick-combat modes.\n\nSome random stuff:\n- Bring ropes, grappling hooks and shovels to dungeons, even if they weigh quite a bit, they will help in the long run. The same is true for sleeping bags and winter coats in the winter.\n- Sometimes splitting up the team and going to different locations is necessary to proceed.","February 23","true","24.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
