I found myself abandoning it rather early on for one simle reason, and that is its save points - or rather, lack thereof.\n\nTheres one save point in this game. One. While this might not seem like so much of a problem at first, since its easy to duck the basic infected enemies, when you come up against regular deaths such as The Gauntlet boss, this makes you want to tear out your hair.  Being of an old school RPG style, you don't exactly wander around the map at high speed (seriously dude, do some cardio - jog once in a while!), and so it takes a while to get back to your regular death spot where you'll have to destory your spacebar tapping through all of the text speech (AGAIN) to make limited progress before dying once more.\n\nBesides this frustrating cycle, the game showed a lot of promise. The moral decisions looked interesting and - while i was regularly walking back and forth to that b*st*rds lair and dying - I found myself seriously considering who to save and who to leave behind.  I also really loved the music, which  added intensity to the action scenes and avoided becoming an annoying background loop.\n\nHowever overall, I found the gameplay just much too fidgety and frustrating. When I took a break and tried to follow a different path, I found myself lost in a  system of caves which (after the gauntlet ordeal) I hadn't the patience to traverse.\n\nPerhaps this is all down to personal preference. Maybe if youre a fan of this genre then you'll find the game wonderful, but this was not the case for me and so I wouldn't recommend it.","April 24, 2015","false","1.8"," 29 of 40 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","29","40","0","4"

The puzzles are interesting, some take some time and if your not slick with your arrow keys, you'll soon find yourself reloading. I recommend this game because it forces you to make decisions in the end about who you will save (if you want) and who will die.\n\nThere is one thing I wish I could've seen more of and that is the end result of what happened after with the people I choose to save. I even imagined the game continuing after the bomb drops, being forced to use the skills and characteristics of those you saved, including the cons to that. Perhaps someone betrays you afterwards or causes problems with someone else while in the shelter.\n\nThe game is worth the 2 bucks.","April 27, 2015","true","9.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

It had a terrific premise, and a pretty decent plot to go with it. Gameplay mechanics were relatively sound and I would have enjoyed it.\n\nWOULD HAVE being the main point in that sentence. The game has a striking lack of save points and when I say lack of, I mean that there's just ONE save point. ONE.\n\nGenerally, a lack of save points doesn't condemn a game to being unplayable. However, when faced with events like the Gauntlet, where multiple deaths are unavoidable, this becomes a major problem. Particularly when the Gauntlet is obviously meant to be a trial-and-error point of the game, meaning you are MEANT to die. The only save point in the game is a good 1-2 minute journey from the Gauntlet.\n\nTL:DR, if you don't enjoy leaving running back and forth between a save point and an almost inevitable death multiple times, don't get this game. I finished it once and I don't intend on playing it again.","April 26, 2015","false","1.0"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","1"

Starts with the "plot" of a thief whom you caught red handed stealing from you; you have a gun, he's cornered in a dead end, but the script pauses so he can run away unscathed because ♥♥♥♥ logic. Then all people you could offer shelter to line up neatly and present themselves, and they each have something like 3 lines. The obnoxious thief is among them. Oh yeah, each person sheltered requires extra food and water, but guess who's expected to go risk life and limb fetching it while they chill in the hall?\n\nIf it hasn't become obvious by this point, the writing is ♥♥♥♥ing terrible. There isn't a natural sounding conversation in the game, nothing makes sense. The characters have zero personality; to say they are unidimensional would be giving too much credit to the barely existent characterization they get.\n\nThe gameplay isn't even worth talking about. This is an RPG Maker game that would sail or sink on the strength of its story, which is terrible.","August 2, 2015","false","2.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I love the atmosphere it creates and the story it's trying to tell. The reason I don't reccomend this game is because it struggles a lot with basic things- the controls are clunky, combat is difficult (although the aspect of only having a few bullets is interesting), and saving your game requires trekking all the way back to your bunker. Bottom line, this game is supposed to be about making hard choices and saving people; yet it seems you can't even make the choice until you've explored everywhere and completed every challenge- neither of which are easy to do because of the less-than-smooth controls. This game has a lot of potential and I would definitely play a revised edition or a sequel, but unfortunately there are too many issues with the mechanics of the game for me to reccomend it right now.","October 26, 2015","false","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
