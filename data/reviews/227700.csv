I have a feeling it will go under sooner or later so I really wouldn't waste my time on it.\n\nFireFall once allowed you to explore the land and play wherever you want. You had a nice and simple class system where you could pick up a class and start playing it without issues. You could play instances with a brand new class and no one would complain or even notice you were a low level.\n\nThat world has gone. The new FireFall (The release 1 year ago) feutures a leveling system. Which forces you to play in set locations until you have gained enough experience points to move on to the next level. Even after playing your faviroute class all the way to level 40 you will be greated for many players typing LFG or LFM into chat. As they're looking for items in instances which are only available at level 40.\n\nYou can no longer play any class you'd like. You have to stick in each level zone until you outlevel it. (If you get a class to level 20 but suddenly want to play a different class you have to go back tot he starting zone and play there instead)\n\nYou can't really play with friends as if you are 5 or more levels above them one of you is going to have a hard time getting experience points and therefore will end up leaving the lower level behind.\n\nI have been playing FireFall for 2 years but this is where I get off the fanbus and say farewell to all my friends I have met in this virtual world.\n\nI've spent over 150 pounds on this game hoping it would someday become the shining beacon that it had promised to be. Unfortunately this beacon is yellow coloured and I don't like yellow beacons if I'm honest.\n\nIf you're looking for a game with repetetive gameplay, an empty and boring storyline with a horribly boring operator talking to you every 5 seconds then this is the game for you! The AI is flawed in so many ways. The 'alien' race is weak and easily killed where as the common bandit will destroy you in a few bullets.\n\nThe whole 'horizontal progression' system of firefall went out of the window and now has been replaced with 'vertical progression'\n\nWe no longer travel the horizon, we take the elevator.\n\nEDIT: I'm glad so many people agree with me. Maybe this will encourage the developers to re-use or go back to some of the older assets :)","July 15, 2015","false","264.9"," 769 of 902 people (85%) found this review helpful 97 people found this review funny","85","769","902","97","63"

In the patch players had their stats nerfed, movement speed, HKM charge, durability, and those stats were put back in... as 1 hour consumables you can buy.\n\nAll vehicle and glider purchases, outside of packs, have been changed to be rentals for up to 30 days. Besides the tutorial bike you have to wait for "special events" for offers that get you faster perm vehicles or chances at perm gliders.\n\nCrafting has been disabled until patch 1.8. Endgame zones we had before have also been disabled till that time.\n\nThe classes have recieved massive revamps, almost all of them are a shadow of their former selves and if you are a returning player then you probably lost a ton of your progress in the migration.\n\nThe game is in a very buggy state, they had been working on this patch for 9 months prior, however due to the chinese parent company The9 pushing the patch before it was ready and layoffs hitting Red5 the entire combat system they worked on over those months was scrapped and reworked 1 month before Friday's release of the patch.\n\nThe old professional voice over work is gone, replaced with temp voices that were put in to cover until they could pay the VAs to do the recordings of the new script, and rerecord the old lines that were changed.\n\nThe real kicker is that this was Red5's last try. If this patch did not massively succeed then the game was going to be shut down in North America and Europe. With its last remnants moved over to China.\n\nIt had the opposite effect. The community is enraged. 9 months of feedback, bug reports, and warning not to push the patch through were ignored. The buggy migration code was pushed out before it was ready under orders from the parent company.\n\nCurrently China is not set to recieve the patch. They are using the entire North American and European player base as bug testers before the patch and the migration code goes over to China.\n\n\nI was first wave Closed Beta. I got to take part in the opening moments of this game when Mark Kern was at the helm. I was there at PAX Prime the days it was first announced. I got to help crash the game, I got to see PvP, PvE, Thumping, when they were all first implemented.\n\nThis game is not worth your money. I once would have recommended this game. I once got a bunch of my friends playing.\n\nWhat the game needed was to do as Mark Kern envisioned: push the melding wall back to reclaim the earth. To unlock more content to explore and play in as a community effort. We needed new frames to be released. Not for a massive revamp that removes frames and crippled the rest.","January 25","false","657.4"," 385 of 434 people (89%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","89","385","434","11","16"

So ignore low play hours on steam.\n\nThis game has gone through some rough times, and 2 major and complete overhauls since they first invited people to beta.

Then a bunch of whiny babies complained about it and thus left us with another Sub par major overhaul of the core game mechanics.\n\nThis game used to be all about exploring where ever you wanted. Thumping where ever you wanted, grinding where ever you wanted. An actuall sandbox about resource collection, crafting your own gear out of what you collect and true exploration.\n\nNow, it's just another "grind missions here, then move on to the next map, grind missions here, then move on.\nThey limited you sooo much from what their 2nd core systems had. Now you have to follow their paths, do what they want you to do. Not to mention you have to grind for yer gear. Stupid RNG system with Loot rolls, really original guys...\n\nWhile it is a unique game, they ruined what it could have been instead of taking a risk and sticking to the amazing game systems they had.","January 19, 2015","false","48.3"," 749 of 893 people (84%) found this review helpful 40 people found this review funny","84","749","893","40","23"

Although the progression system was quite close to the current one (level based gear with module slots), the game showed enormous promise to become its own "thing".\nIt started with 0.5, where the new tech tree involved a much more horizontal progression, which was less about inflating numbers and more broadifying your combat options. It also brought in a constraint system (fixed at the time), which forced you to make decisions about the gear you could equip. It sounds like a bad thing on paper, but it actually made you *think* about your character. You could decide exactly how to build it, how to specialize it. Your character was truly one you'd call your own.\nAnother milestone passed, and the tech tree was refined in a deep, complex crafting system while the character progression focused on constraints (which became upgradeable through gained experience and collected resources). As your constraints improved, you could equip stronger, better gear (bringing some vertical progression) while making sure you could never equip all of the top quality ones at the same time.\nIt was an ideal diagonal progression system, one that I sincerely hoped would stay for good.\n\nAs for the world, well... we were promised an open, sandbox-ish world that would evolve and change through the players' actions, and for a time we had something quite close.\nCoral Forest used to be quite a dangerous place where watchtowers and other key points could fall to the Chosen any time if left undefended. Places like Sunken Harbor and Thump Dump could even be submerged by the Melding, and that had consequences, albeit temporary.\nStill, we really had the feeling that the region was the last bastion of humanity surrounded by an implacable force from another world.\nAnd most importantly, anyone could contribute to an event (ares missions, thumpers, melding tornados and so on...) and be equally rewarded regardless of his own progression.\nEveryone mattered.\nEverywhere mattered.\nEvery*thing* mattered.\n\nSo, what happened?\n\nWell, progression is now back to being level-based with slottable gear and no constraints. The consequence is you don't need to care about your character, you just pile up level after, equip that white Gun'O'Pwn because it's better than your old purple Gun'O'Whack you picked up 5 levels ago, you see numbers inflate exponentially and it doesn't mean crap because your enemies' health increased by the same factor, you follow the same jobs over and over since they're all variant of kill/fetch/escort (Yep, there are escort missions. The kind that makes you ragequit 99% of the time).\n\nThe crafting system has been simplified to the point of being dumbed down, yet at the same time required several times more material grinding than before, especially when some components can only be gotten through the goodwill of the RNG.\nSaid RNG also govern the result of your craft, so you are not even sure if the result is what you want.\n\nThe old open world has been segregated into level-based areas, so players too high or too low for an ares mission, job or whatever would be penalized in the rewards gained (that's right, if you are a lowbie and want to try something challenging, you are screwed).\nVirtually all of the 'chosen war' aspect have been taken out of coral forest. No invasions, no incursions, a few strike teams every once in a while... the "last bastion of humanity" became a dull, unchanging place.\n\nWith the release patch, the game changed from an innovative, off-the-beaten-track MMOFPS into essentially WoW with guns. It had a lot of promise, but instead went the generic, unimaginative way.\n\nI regularly played this game for two years and enjoyed the hell out of it. I just don't any more the way it is now.\n\nFor people who never played the beta, you might enjoy it. You just wouldn't realize how good it could have been.","July 27, 2014","false","30.0"," 3,798 of 4,818 people (79%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","79","798","4","7","195"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mich2b/recommended/227700/","mich2b","[Cash.net] Mich2B","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mich2b/","63 products in account","I just realised I didn't reccomend this game. And I don't know why! (TL;DR VERSION BELOW)\nFirefall is unique MMO. Why? Because:\n1. It's really free - you can even gain pets without paying a single dollar. Just chance for pet is pretty low, but you have 100% for advanced frame YOU want after gaining max level.\n2. It's one of VERY rare MMOs, where there are guns, just like in good old shooters, not some auto-attack + abilities. Of course, there are abilities, don't worry, but there's even a class which has... Guns instead of abilities. Yep, 5 weapons instead of them. But ok, onto review here.\nBASICSGameplay\nGame is set in First Person or Third person perspective - you can change it in any moment. You play game as a mix of typical MMO (like WoW) and shooter (like CoD, but I'd say it's not very similar). There are 5 main character classes which you can change it every moment, you don't need to make new character. Of course every class has it's own level to level. Every frame (they're called like this in game) has it's two advanced versions, which are modifications of main one (with exception of Dreadnaught - he has 3 advances).\nCombat\nFirefall is shooter + abilities - Left Click to shoot your weapon, right click to use special ability of weapon and press 1-4 buttons to activate abilities. You can also use items from 5-8 buttons, like grenades, medkits etc. Also, there is meele under G, but I don't see many players use it. I'm a fan of it, though. Your primary weapon (each class has it's own locked to them, advanced frames can use their weapons + main frame shooty) has limited ammo, while your secondary one has unlimited. I won't say too much about them, I don't wanna waste space.\nMissions and world\nThere are 8 main missions (more coming with new update. MANY more) which you can do in normal mode or hardcore mode, solo or in group of 5 players. You can take smaller missions from Job Board, but they're a bit boring. But hey! But what if I don't wanna do missions? No problem. Firefall is fully-open world.  You can get anywhere you want, as long as it's not a big melding curtain. Because it most probably will kill you. You can do missions, you can go to randomly-generated events (plenty of them, you won't see many during 1-9 levels, but it will change) or you can just explore world - game even gives you achievements for finding hidden locations. However, game becomes grinding your way after some time, which is sad. You can avoid it, but leveling up this way will take very much time. There are 5 locations - Coral Forest (1-24lvl), Sertao (25-36), Devil's Tusk (37-40), Amazon (40) and Broken Peninsula (Desert where nobody lives. Sad)\nCrafting\nThere is crafting in game, but I won't call it VERY interesting, rather simple and easy-to-go. You place a thumper, a device which mines stuff, you collect things from killed NPCs and then you refine it. You salvage things for research points and crystite (currency), and then you research things like new weapons, modules, medpacks using research points and CY. After you researched a thing, you craft it with more CY and iron/tungusten/whatever/refinedthingsfromenemies. Voila, you've got your gun/module/ability or medpack.\nLeveling up\nHow to level up? Well, you can't level up by messing around city. Do missions, if you have LOTS of free time. Do random events, if you want to or you don't have too much free time. Level up with other guys, there are big numbers of these. I'd love to say PLENTY, but this game is so unpopular. I hope it'll change soon. Maybe thanks to my reviev ;)\nBut what after leveling up to 40? You can still mess around last location. You can go to Amazon, VERY hard location and try to fight with Chosen (enemies) for forest domination (yep, AI isn't best, but they'll try to capture your bases while you try to do same to them). You can go for raids or hardcore missions for better loot.\nSTUFFClasses\nThere are 5 main classes: Dreadnaught, someone who takes tank role, Assault, guy all-about damage and mobility, Biotech, healer (bad at it, tbh. Dragonfly rulez), Recon, NOT a sniper, I'd rather call him light infantry, and Engineer, a painful class to play. Sets up sentries and supply stations. You'll probably choose him as your first class. That's normal, I did same. They're just too weak at higher levels, and without support... Powerful at watchtower retake.\nEach class has two (or three) advanced frames. After paying some money or gaining level 40 you can choose one. Each advanced frame has his own set of abilities and weapon, but they can use main frame stuff. They look like this:Dreadnaught - Rhino (DPS) - Mammoth (Tank) - Arsenal (Screw abilities when I can have gunz)\nAssault - Tigerclaw (Specialist of PWNing single targets) - Firecat (AoE)\nBiotech - Dragonfly (Healer) - Recluse (Damage + poison, healing only with BIO skills)\nEngineer - Bastion (Right course for engi) - Electron (Powerful support, but nobody plays as him)\nRecon - Raptor (Sniper with charging rifle) - Nighthawk (Sniper with bolt-action rifle)Random stuff\nCurrency\nThere are some "money" things. We see here: Crystite (CY) - collected from almost everything. Used to almost everything.\nCredits (CR) - Collected from final box in small numbers (you gain them after some playing). You can also sacrifice CY for more CR, in exchange rate of 25:1. Used to buy things from market, self-revive or buy RB.\nRed Beans (RB) - premium currency. Used to buy things from shop, make your inventory bigger. It's possible to buy them, of course, but also you can request exchange of your CR for RBs. You place how many CR you want for 1 RB, and then number of RB you want. If somebody finds your offer lucrative, he'll trade it. I did it many times, safe.\nCharacter customization - You can change the way your character looks in any moment. You can change his head, skin color, hair style, hair color, even sex, why not? We haven't got a shortage of battleframes. Also, you can pay for additional customs - like helmets - or just drop them during gameplay. You have many options to customize your character, but it's not TES, expect rather a bit better-than-WoW customisablity.\nGraphics - Good. Very good from a distance. Beaches of Copa, forests of Redwood or Kearney's Transit Hub, desert of Sertao, lava pools of Devil's Tusk and Amaze Amazon of Amazon. From closure, it's still good, but not that good.\nCommunity - GREAT. THESE GUYS ARE AWESOME. Seriously, in my whole career here I saw only two guys being rude or spamming. New players ask questions, they don't get shouted, they get answers. There are multiple clans, I reccomend being a part of one - not hard to enlist. I'm in [WaR] and I received a warpaint from them, thanks :D\nTL;DR versionGame is worth any money. Best part? It doesn't need any. It's free in 100%, even pets. Has 16 classes. No auto-attack crap, you have your trusty weapons and 4 skills. Good graphics. Amazing community. Found a friend which most probably got banned... Woops.\nIn short:Gameplay: 9/10 Good idea as for MMO, guns, abilities, open world, but too much grinding end-game.\nGraphics: 7/10 Good from distance, but not very good from close-up. Also, some people may not like a bit anime theme here, I'm not sad because of it though.\nAudio: 0/10 Aero's accent is annyoying. (Joke) But in real, soundtrack of this game is awesome. Sounds are bit higher than decent, and are often buggy. So I give 7/10\nOverall: 8.5/10 - Dang it, it's a free game, if I have to add this little detail it would be 9.5/10. If you like shooting games, GOTTA TRY IT!\nUhh... Rating is appreciated? Thanks. Was typing it for 30 minutes.\nMissed something you wanna know about?

And they have me deterred from even FINISHING my install for the main client itself.\n\nSo, let's go over a history lesson of what the game had right and wrong from start to finish.\n\nSo, in the beginning when I start playing the open beta back in August of 2014, the game kicked ♥♥♥. There was so much variety it made my head spin! You could literally keep finding things to do... Thumping, fending off angry Chosen, ARES missions, Chosen Strikes, defending Sunken Harbor and Thump Dump....\n\nThat ALLLL ended when the game launched on Steam. The variety of things to do mysteriously vanished, along with the sense of direction the game initially had, quelling all chances of growth slowly as time went on. The first features to be removed of course, were the chosen activities. Next on the list came resource variety, taking away literally EVERY resource, ALL 18 of them, and replacing them with Iron, Tungsten, Titanium and Uranium. The bio- and mech- resources already in the game got more additions, increasing the rediculous ♥♥♥♥ING level of farming and grinding required to even step ONE foot forward in the damned game.\n\nMove on to 1.3, things have gotten even worse with the removal of the Battleframes' variety and reducing the progression style to your basic-♥♥♥ level up system, going even FURTHER BACK from the Constraint system. In addition to this, the unwanted and un-needed focus of story was put into the game, getting in the way of the gameplay itself and literally ♥♥♥♥ING with the pace nine ways from a Jesus' Chicken Sunday.\n\n....\n\n.............\n\n........................\n\nBUT AT LEAST AT THE TIME THE ♥♥♥♥ING DEAF-AND-HALF-A-♥♥♥♥♥♥ DEVELOPERS HAD A SUSTAINED IQ HIGH ENOUGH NOT TO DOUSE THEIR OWN GAME IN GASOLINE AND THEN CARPET BOMB IT WITH CRASHING ZEPPELINS FILLED WITH FOUR CUBIC ♥♥♥♥TONS OF HELIUM, PURE OXYGEN, CONTAINERS OF PURE SODIUM, AND NITROCGLICERIN AND LIQUID ♥♥♥♥ING NAPALM IN SEPERATE CONTAINERS, ALSO ALL IN CUBIC ♥♥♥♥TONS MULTIPLE MOTHER♥♥♥♥ING TIMES UNTIL THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT BUT A HORRIBLE DISFIGURED, SMOKING CARCAS SOMEHOW STILL ALIVE BEGGING TO BE SHOT IN THE HEAD FOR IT TO BE OVER WITH.\n\nTHIS... Is what 1.6 has done, according to what I've learned. And I DARE NOT get on for the sake of my own sanity. The introduction of lockboxes, Spiral Knights-and-a-half level grinding and farming, and temporary stat boosts have milked what remains of this victimized game for what little left it's worth.\n\nIn addition to that, literally EVERY MOTHER ♥♥♥♥ING BATTLEFRAME IN THE GAME HAS BEEN NERFED UNTIL IT IS A GOD DAMN FOSSIL DEEP ENOUGH IN THE CRUST TO HAVE SUPPOSEDLY BELONGED FROM THE ♥♥♥♥ING JURASSIC PERIOD OF DINOSAURS. AND OH MY MOTHER ♥♥♥♥ING *GOD*, DON'T GET ME STARTED WITH THE INSANE, SADISTIC ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T THAT IS REMOVING THE ALTERNATIVE FIRING MODES FROM LITERALLY EVERY SINGLE PRIMARY WEAPON THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE EQUIPPED IN THE GAME.\n\nAND IF *THAT* ♥♥♥♥ ISN'T ENOUGH TO SCARE YOUR STUBBORN ♥♥♥ AWAY, THE ♥♥♥♥ING WALL-OF-CHINA LEVEL OF BUGS WELL DEFINITELY TRY IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE HORRIBLE AUDIO RECORDINGS REPLACING WHAT WAS ORIGINALLY IN THERE ALONG WITH EVERYTHING YOU OWN POSSIBLY BEING DELETED OR RENDERED INTO A RENTAL.\n\nThis game suffers from something I call Destiny-itis. WHY Destiny-itis? IT'S THE ONLY ♥♥♥♥ING EXAMPLE ACCURATE ENOUGH TO DEPICT A GREAT ♥♥♥♥ING GAME BEING EXPECTED AND SHOWING ITSELF TO BE SO POORLY DONE IT DOESN'T EVEN QUALIFY AS A 16TH OF SOMEONE'S LEFT FAT ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥ CHEEK.\n\nThat being said.... There's literally nothing you can find you'll enjoy here more than you'll enjoy in most other games. HAVING finished my angry, relative rant to this review, I've learned a while ago, to hope for the best and expect the worst. In THAT respect, Firefall hasn't disappointed, but with the target goal of building back its playerbase, it's long since passed the point of no return with Red5 Studios being purchased by a Chinese business company. If you care for your wallet, money, sanity, time, ♥♥♥♥s, ♥♥♥♥♥, happiness and fun,... You won't EVER wish this game on ♥♥♥♥ing ANYONE. NOT YOU, NOT YOUR ENEMIES, NOT YOUR ABUSIVE STEP FATHER. NOT ♥♥♥♥ING *ANYONE*.","February 3","false","34.0"," 162 of 193 people (84%) found this review helpful 65 people found this review funny","84","162","193","65","29"

In the beginning you can use the basic versions of 5 unique battle frames, they each level independently and though you only have to do the main story missions once, you can replay them all you like.  Each basic battleframe has 2 or 3 unlockable advanced versions, these are unlocked either via cash shop, the player-run market with ingame currency, or using pilot tokens from leveling another frame to level 40 (max level).\n\nThe problem is that there isn't a very large variety of things to do, even at the start, there are about 4 different types of random events around the map, there are a few (not nearly enough) area missions you pick up at the bulletin boards in town, or main missions.  After you outlevel the area you're in, you move onto the next one.  There'll be some different monsters/people to kill, but essentially it's all the same.\n\nThe even worse problem is that you have to do this for any battleframe you use... There's no different story, no different events or missions, or quests... So essentially you'll do the same thing (which in the beginning is exciting but it only lasts at most a matter of weeks.) over and over again for as many battleframes you want/have.\n\nHaving friends in the game to play with only prolongs it so far.","October 30, 2014","true","193.6"," 199 of 252 people (79%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","79","199","252","5","2"

Well we're talking about developers ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the bucket.\n\nIn summary the problems with this game are:\n\n*No endgame content, whatever exists of endgame is a bunch of repetitive dailies that lead to a dissapointing bullet sponge boss. But hey, I can tolerate that because free mobility, jetpacks and gliders.\n\nMobility got nerfed to ♥♥♥♥.\n\n\n*Horrendous balance. 1/3 the classes in the game are broken overpowered, 1/3 are broken underpowered the remaining 1/3 is just broken.\nAs of this update, 3 classes are viable to use everywhere and only 2 are actually fun to use and everyone who likes the other 7 gets to suck a ♥♥♥♥.\n\n*Reverending grind (seriously warframe has less grind than this). It takes multiple HOURS to farm a single max tier item. Now, you might think "It's end tier, it SHOULD take a long time." and that's good and all, but here's the problem, you got 16 classes, each class has a unique primary and 4 abilities + a core.\n\nThe primary and the abilities need 3 modules each. Do the math and try to figure out how much time it takes to max a single frame.\n\nDid I forgot to mention if you want an ace custom (that is, personalized with special bonuses/stats that fit your playstyle) you need to craft an additional custom prefix for each your abilities and weapons?\n\nAll that plus 5 secondaries shared among frames.\n\nBut hey, I can tolerate that because free mobility, jetpacks and gliders.\n\nCrafting has now been replaced by tinkering.\n\nWhat does this eseentially mean?\n\nWell you can no longer craft your weapons and modules and you need to find them in random drops or crates you open with keys brought from the store. (Yes because that worked out so well for tf2, dota, csgo, payday, spiral knights and god knows whatever else, the difference is that in those games crates contain cosmetics, not upgraded weapons that you will need to use)\n\nIn order to upgrade said weapons and modules to make them upto raid stadard you need to spend thousands upon thousands of credits and salvage hundreds upon hundreds of weapons all paired with an RNG to have a crit tinker (that gives big bonuses) or a noncrit tinker (that gives smaller bonuses) (that you can pay premium currency in the store to get tinker tools to give you a higher crit chance) and said proccess has to be repeated for all weapons, abilities and modules 9 times. (Assuming every single tinker is a crit, if its not, you're gonn have to redo untill it is, because noncrit tinkers are worthless.)\n\nTinkers are essentially stat improvements that increase various stats of your weapons.\n\n*Lack of combat variety. Combat is composed mainly of braindead mobs moving slowly and shooting at you as you shoot them back. But hey, combat is still fun because free mobility, jetpacks and gliders.\n\nCombat now has even less variety since all alternative fires, a massive chunk of abilities and all signature perks got axed.\n\nYay.\n\n\n*The worst imaginable raid system to ever exist in the history of ever.\n\nYou can only do each of the 3 raids once per week with 20 people, and out of those 20 people only 4 get 1 item that's not even guartenteed to be epic (epic meaning that you won't need to replace it down the line with something better). If you got nothing, wait untill next week do the raid again and pray that you get something this team. What this means is that you can raid every week for a straight year and get nothing.\nBut hey, I tolerate that because jetpacks, gliders and free mobility.\n\nThe raid system is now EVEN worse.\nYou got only 1 raid, that you do once a week, BUT there is a cap on the ammount of reward tokens for it you can hold to a number of 8.\n\nSo, you got 2 insanely limiting factors at once at play.\n\nSo, that essentially means that you can only farm for 3 items out of 10 frames at a time, and you can't stockpile for when updates come.\n\n*Really bad optimization.  Not much to say here. It's reeeaaaaally reaally bad folks.\n\nBut it's ok.\nI can cope with all that because the movement system is extremely fun, you can fly forever, jump around freely perform airplane tricks while still in combat, never touch the ground and still be helpful to your team and generally mobility in this game is really fun and really invigorating.\nYeah, this doesen't exist anymore either. All frames took a massive movement hit as well as gliding. Infinite flight or really fast movement aren't possibly anymore.\n\nSo why is this review negative? There is no reason to keep this in anymore, the game has lost most of its redeeming qualities.\n\n2 important notes.\n\n1.)Every 2 months a COMPLETE overhaul happens every 3 updates that completely change everything into what is basically a new game.\nSo far we've had like 4-5 complete overhauls.\n\n2.)Usually, said overhaul is the for the worst.\n\nFor example, in an older version of firefall you had pretty much completely unlimited and free airplane flight with minimal investment which meant everyone could enjoy it and everyone could have fun without sacrificing other parts of their build.\n\nThere were no levels and all proggresion was horrisontal.\n\nIn the same update you could also craft 101% ace custom weapon with you being able to tailor every single stat of a weapon however you wanted to select what fit you best.\n\nThat got axed in favor of more grounded combat and the neverending grind of a crafting system I mentioned above that allowed nearly no customization.\n\n\nIf the devs don't trust their own game why should I?\n\n\nUltimately, I think the game is worth trying out just for the experience because it has jetpacks  and flying bikes.\n\nAs of today, the flying bike that needed 1 straight month of grinding has been nerfed to ♥♥♥♥ so the developers can resell it to us for real money which they are.\n\nLast but not least, remember those pay2win boosts I mentioned above?\nWell, if you pay red beans, the premium currency gotten with real money or with trading, you can pay for hourly boosters that reduce the damage you take, how fast your ultimate charges, how fast you move and how far you can fly. (More jet energy, that also affects how much you can heal someone if you're playing dragonfly because your heal gun uses jet energy as ammo)\n\n\nIn the end, I can't really recommend this game in its current state.\n\nBut hey, in 6 months another complete overhaul will happen since the lead designer got canned just like the 3 ones before him, I'll see you then.","September 11, 2015","false","213.5"," 392 of 528 people (74%) found this review helpful 51 people found this review funny","74","392","528","51","131"

They've ramped the dynamic content up a lot. For all those complaints about being 'forced' to do Jobs to exp, Red5 responded. You can now go from 1-40 doing nothing but randomly spawned missions if you wanted to. These include things like Chosen drop pods, bandit ambushes, lockbox assaults and similar. They added the mobility to Assault many were asking for, and did a tuning pass on a lot of other frames to fix a lot of problems people were having. All in all the devs have been really responsive to the actual issues.\n\nOf course you'll now see people on the forums complaining that the game is too hard now! All these enemies! We wanted a war not challenge!\n\nAll in all they've been doing an excellent job of polishing up what needs polish and adding in new events and trying to work up new live events for the players.\n\nUpdated the 9th of August 2014: I just wanted to update this a bit to say that the devs have remained constantly talkative in game, interacting with the community and answering questions and the like. I've gotten a chance to play with quite a few of the crew from Red5 and they are all pretty passionate people.\n\nThe forums for this game are turning into a pretty toxic mess, but in game I've seen nothing but positive changes as Red5 continues to try to iterate and get the game more polished. The first few weeks were pretty rough but I've got to meet a lot of cool new players who seem to honestly enjoy the game. Red5 seems to have a direction they want to go and seem to be following it much better then the kind of random experiments they were doing before. After yesterdays Firefall Live I have more faith in their ability to take feedback and data and move the game forward.\n\nJust, you know, avoid the forums. It's pretty much the bottom half of the internet. If youtube and news articles have taught me anything its that you never read the bottom half of the internet.\n\nI've been playing Firefall since near the beginning.\n\nI want to make something clear for anyone who reads the negative reviews: They are horribly nostalgic. The 'constraints' system boiled down to 90% of the population using the same build (Max cooldown and jump jets) so they could fly around in circles and spam abilities without a modicum of skill. Regen was high and it was easy to make yourself literally invincible. The game was incredibly easy and no one wants to admit this because that'd ruin their rosey naval gazing.\n\nOn to the game we have now: It's bigger. The world is really well made and has a lot of interesting locations. The different frames all feel different enough to be noticeable. You can hit level cap in a week or less if you just pay a bit of attention to how you gain exp. Crafting currently is too overtuned in that the prices are sky high, but that'll probably get toned down. (Dev's have said they wanted to start high and go down because almost no one whines about having to spend less to build things.)\n\nAll in all its a really solid shooter with heavy RPG elements. There are really fun raids at endgame and the instanced dungeons that tell that main story are generally really fun. You can solo all of them (Well not the raid. At least not that I know of.) but they definitely shine with a group.\n\nAlso the assault class plays like a Tribes spinfusor soldier. Huzzah to that.","July 31, 2014","true","174.7"," 827 of 1,148 people (72%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","72","827","1","3","23"

There is resource harvesting and dynamic world events that let you feel like you're in some kind of living world.  If you like playing team games, resource harvesting, basic crafting and killing aliens and bugs then you should like this game.\n\nIt's okay for a free to play game, there is time gated content that requires you to level up your stating classes to unlock advanced ones. There is visual styles like paint patterns and color schemes that you do have to pay for. You can pay to unlock advanced frames but you can’t pay to level up the equipment you use.\n\nYou can however pay for XP modifiers so you can level up faster, there are random daily incentives that lure you into staying logged in for up to about an hour and to do so daily.\n\nCrafting is time gated with the ability to pay to speed up crafting.\n\nThe cash shop has social items as well that don’t do anything other than in game fireworks and junk similar to making pets appear.\n\nYou shouldn't waste money in this game, the developers change features and flip/flop on designs when ever they feel like it.\n\nWhy is this not recommended? 3.0 2/22/2016\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nWell looks like the engineer got another nerf, thanks.\nOh yeah crafting has been disabled until the next update....\nLet that sink in: game features are disabled post release, pending major game changes...\npost release...\nGuess this is the NGE i was waiting for...\n\nWhy is this not recommended? 2.0 2/5/2016\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nSummary: Game released Jul 29, 2014, 1.5 years later they decide to change major game mechanics with several classes and flat out delete one class.

Complex systems rewarding crafting systems were simplified so that more players would join.\n\nResources are a prime example of something completely thrown away., Originally resources had quality levels. Anyone that played Star Wars Galaxies would have immediately seen the inspiration of the system from that game. You could ultimately affect your crafted equipment by the quality of the resources and the quality of those components you made from them.\n\n\nThere is this fog that kills you called "the melding" that you use to be able to push back, they got rid of this mechanic and just left the areas open for everyone.. ie no work they also removed alot of the npcs from the area that you would have fought and leveled up to push it back.\n\n\nYou didn’t have or need all of these frames, all of the specialized equipment that only the advanced frames have were originally usable by the base frames. You could mix and match parts to suit your play style.\n\nUltimately what you have today is H-O-R-S-E when originally they had basketball. It’s not a bad game, but it was a better game that was ruined for money.\n\nThey decided basketball was too risky and people might not want to play.","July 18, 2015","false","11.6"," 168 of 221 people (76%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","76","168","221","10","3"

I played it for 3 years, many many hundreds of hours I suffered it's buggy grind. No more. I just wish to prevent you from repeating my mistake.]\n[Disclaimer#2: This review is LONG. TL;DR version is at the bottom of the review]\n\nI am Megakoresh and this is my story in the game that set out to break the rules and ended up breaking only hearts:\n\nIn Novermber 2011 I have joined the beta for "Firefall" that was having all the right ideas for "fixing" the MMO genre, fixing all the things I hated it for. It also was coming up with a revolutionary method of development at a time - community-driven development was not nearly as widespread then.\n\nGame started with a PvP component and sheduled tests twice a week. People would organize, play, provide feedback, the next patch the feedback was directly implemented and fully documented a to what was changed and why. When PvE launched in April 2012, this continued, the game was slowly improving leading up to the major patch in August 2012, when the game opened the cash shop. That patch and the systems that came with it was the biggest and the last long-term imrovement to the game. 2 years ago.\n\nThe signs that the game doesn't really know where it wants to be, of mismatch between features, of the lacking gameplay and shooter component, were subtle at first, but community, has picked up fast and warned the developers of the things they needed to work on. These larger warnings were ignored, but smaller suggestions were constantly being implemented, often without considering their "compatibility" with the game's design, but it pleased those who posted the suggestions and created this illusion that the "community-driven" development was still going on, even if by now it was in fact searching forums for issues and solutions that the developers already decided on, acting them out and then claiming it was "requested by community".\n\nAs time went by the development focused more and more on economy, [mostly vertical] progression, adding various stats and senseless enemies upon a barebones stat-driven gameplay system which meant any additional content was suffering from diminishing returns as far as gameplay is concerned. Any extra ability didn't matter because of 30 second cooldown, which, like most things in Firefall, absolutely doesn't fit the fast-paced, spammy combat. Any extra enemies were just extra-buggy reskins of already buggy current enemies and so on, you get the idea.\n\nAs time went by, the players, who signed up for a game that promised to be a true MMOShooter, started getting frustrated at the continued focus on the MMORPG grind, economy, progression treadmill and ignoring the gameplay, despite consntantly trying our best and spending a lot of effort on feedback, thinking that the developers still consider it with the game in mind, not their own personal biases.\n\nWasted effort and continued degradation of the game are sure ingredients for conflict and as the feedback started to be intertwined with [rather reasonable and polite] calling out the devs for them ignoring the feedback on the topics of gameplay and variety, we all have realised who Red5 really were, as they began aggressively defending their philosophies without (unlike the community's complaints) any evidence to back it up. This followed into more negativity from the community, which in turn has followed into.... censorship.\n\nYep, in a totally unexpected display of unprofessionalism, seeing that the threads and voices of the "veterans" and people who wanted the Firefall from 2011, were being heavily supported by the rest of community, Red5 went over and simply banned the people in question, including me, from the forums, where 99% of the feedback is discussed. Following that, as soon as people recognized my name on their devstream in the twitch chat, they immediately banned me from it as well.\n\nAfter that they proceeded to keep making the same mistakes they were making ever since August 2012. These spanned across EVERYTHING in the game: from balancing:\nWeapon X is hit-scan, fast firing, high damage per shot, designed for "skillful marksmen"; too OP. Options: make it projectile, >>reduce fire rate to increase skill level<<, nerf damage. They did: nerf damage. "Skilled marksmen" my ♥♥♥.\n\nto resources:\nOur resource system is too complex, but not deep enough. Options: nerf amount of resources and levels, increased the imprortance of comboing resources for different results to give players more freedom; ADD OVER 9000 RESOURCES FOR MAXIMUM INVENTORY SPAM!!!. Guess what Red5 did. And then they added inventory limits a year later because servers couldnt handle it. Pfft...\n\nto enemies:\nEnemies are too easy for leveled players, need to make them harder. Options: add more abilities to current enemies, add telegraphs, high damage attacks, area-buffing, make each enemy a threat and scale spawn compositions OR BUFF ALL THE HP!!!!. Guess what Red5 did.\n\nIn addition they highly encouraged fanboish behaviour; screaming and flaming on forums was not punished so long as it was in favour of the dev's point of view. One of the CMs tried his best to try and bring the old spirit back, to be objective and fair, but ultimately his efforts were in vain. Still, he was the only bright spot after Red5 showed their true colours, I hope he quits and finds a good studio to work in instead.\n\nWhen you were just defending some stupid mechanic like death penalty (which isn't supported by this game at all, and you will see why as soon as you start playing), without insulting anyone, the devs would often "Like" your post, which you can guess what effect it has on a fanboi. The devs eventually hid visbility of "likers", just displaying their quanitity instead.\n\nEventually most of the older players got ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at being ignored, censored, screamed at by fanbois, and left. Those that tried to circumvent the game's grind through exploits after months of begging the devs to reduce the grind, were wiped and left too.\n\nThe game started dying and the devs started running out of money. So what did they do? Take a wild guess fellas. They started frantically implementing whatever 2 year old suggestions (that were screamed about to them over the course of the beta) they could implement in a short amount of time. But by this point it is much too late. The game was built upon a base design for a shooter with minor MMORPG elements, but the meat and most of the bones that were added in during the development are that of a traditional MMORPG grindfest.\n\n=================================================================\n\nAs a result you have a game that is an extremely repetitive and boring ability shooter, with abilities having 30 second cooldowns, adding nothing whatsoever to the variety (they scale down to 5 seconds, which in some cases makes it extremely OP, but it will require you to pay hundreds of $$$ or grind for hundreds of hours and babysit research for months to get to that cooldown).\n\nIt's jetpacks, freedom of movement and very lush colourful world coupled with excellent aesthetics and graphical fidelity will provide a high "WOW factor", until it blows off and you realise that the jetpacks are just tools for random bunnyhopping around, with that being the only reliable way to avoid damage. It's MMORPG elements are just as lacking, with a severe lack of content, buggy and grindy gameplay and enemies and the same boring "dynamic" quests, that have to be repeated thousands of times.\n\nA ton of money, tears, wasted effort and broken promises; this game is a testament to the "Never believe in 'ideas'" rule of modern gaming industry. The community is nice though. One of the best out there, so at least that is not a lie. If you are going to play this game, it would be nice if you tried and keep that tradition. It is the only good thing about the game aside from it's looks.","July 30, 2014","false","0.1"," 2,301 of 3,414 people (67%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","67","301","3","10","165"

I played back in beta where the focus was on the idea of thumping (obtaining resources) and teamplay, with open world events being common such as having areas taken over and such. There was MASSIVE potential for tech tree progression, the crafting system, and development of the storyline.\n\nAnd that's where it all went wrong. Nowadays, the focus is mostly on grinding up to certain levels and then instancing to fight the same things over and over and over again. The storyline is bland and has made perhaps 5% progress since closed beta, and the balancing is horrendous. Each time they make a change to a component such as crafting, something becomes "overpowered" or easier for the community. They then proceed to nerf this, which leads to another area becoming popular. Nerfs upon nerfs upon nerfs. No real content changes, failing to understand that their new crafting is fundamentally flawed to begin with.\n\nCombat wise they made the game too much of a mix. A focus on teamplay oriented mining, or solo adventure? How about we try to do both and fail miserably simultaneously? They are just all over the place. I could rant on and on about this game, but there is honestly just too much.\n\nTLDR: This game had potential and now it's a grindfest.

Then some of the harsh realities start to hit you.\n\nThe game starts you off by allowing you to choose one of several basic classes, like Assault, Dreadnaught, Recon, etc, and upon reaching level 40 (max level) with any of these classes, you are given 10 pilot points to unlock an advanced version of the class. Herein lies one of the game's irritating problems. The grind becomes very, very annoying. It's just continual back and forth between Job Boards, with a few world events thrown in like crashed LGVs or thumpers. It would be fine if it was fun, but once you do it a couple of times, the missions get extremely repetitive and tedious.  One of the annoying ways the Job Board missions can make life hell for you is by forcing you to travel long distances back and forth, and if you don't have an LGV (a type of vehicle) or your glider is on cooldown, it becomes very tedious. Yes, I understand the developers need to make money somehow, and this is clearly a way to make people consider buying an LGV, and that's fine, I just don't like it and I'm warning others.\n\nUnlocking advanced frames is extremely, extremely grindy for a new player that hasn't been in the beta for a long time and already has everything unlocked. Say you pick Recon as your starter class, and you want to unlock one of its advanced classes, the Nighthawk. Unless you straight up buy it with Red Beans (the premium currency), or from the Community Market with credits (another premium currency, you convert between the regular currency crystite <> credits, and credits <> Red Beans; it's not easy to obtain the large amounts of credits needed by exchanging crystite), you're going to have to first go through the grind of leveling up your Recon to maximum level, and then once you've unlocked your Nighthawk, you're going to have to start the leveling process all over from the beginning to level that up. If you want to unlock any other class, now you have to level up the Nighthawk to level 40, etc. etc. Simply put, it's extremely, extremely grindy.\n\nIf that wasn't all bad enough, that's just grinding with classes. The grind you have to go through regarding crafting is another pain.\n\nI will say playing some of the classes themselves are fun, but the process of getting to play any of them properly is nowhere near fun.\n\nEDIT: In fairness to the game, I will say that they have done a nice job designing the actual world itself. The graphics look very nice most of the time (unless you get close to any rocks in the game, my god those are ugly). Using gliders and the LGVs feels nice, it's just the process of getting there that's a huge pain. The game's soundtrack was also very nice to listen to.","July 29, 2014","false","35.2"," 1,018 of 1,540 people (66%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","66","018","1","3","36"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vurczi/recommended/227700/","Vurczi","Vurczi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vurczi/","510 products in account","2016 March Update: The most fun about this game for me was how the Dreadnaught, especially the Mammoth played out with some of it's special abilities. One that stood out was the Tremors ability which for one had one of the best animations and it helped you when your mate is overrun and is down.\n\nWith recent patch the Tremors and Teleportation Shot (another ability I enjoyed as it also was a helping hand in the same situation) were removed and replaced with abilities that are only useful for other situations which we already had the rest of the abilities for.\n\nThe direction this game is going is not really bright and I no longer have any interest in this game, it was fun and cool with friends, but not anymore.\n\nOverall: 4/10\n\nOrginal Review from 2014 July:\n"FireFall have delivered many great things since it was first released (closed alpha) and I can only say the game can be insanely fun, unlike other MMOs FireFall feels a little different, it's a game that you can hardly compare to other MMOs, which is good.\n\nHere are some of the positive things that make FireFall outstanding.\n\n- Random Events. (Randomness is the main reason this game feels different and it is the feature that makes it insanely fun to play)\n- Graphics. (It is not realistic, it stays closer to Borederlands style than reality, which gives the whole game a better feel, more smoother and relaxing feel)\n- Design. (The World is very nicely designed, with places that won't make you wish to never go back to, instead, it is something you don't mind to visit thousands of times)\n- Enemies. (The enemies in this game reminds me to Borderlands, every single enemy looks awesome and well designed. While some are cute and fun to squash, others are cool and badass "I'm looking at you Terrorclaw!")\n- Chosen attacks/wars (Invasion aint here yet. The game is capable of showing from tens to hundreds of enemies at once, making these Chosen attacks/wars an experience you don't get in any other MMO, fighting against an army of enemies is more fun than anything I've ever experienced in MMOs, it's like you are in a LoTR battle)\n- Battleframes (frames are your armors and each class has a different armor. These armors are for 1. look awesome and for 2. are paintable, they are not completely customizable, but you can still put on a different jetpack or a reactor on your back)\n- NOT PAY 2 WIN (Yes, it is extremely rare to see a F2P game that is not P2W in any form. FireFall is completely free, there is in game curreny "red beans", but everything you can buy with them can be acquired in game for free)\n\nNow, here are all the negative things that bothers me.\n\n- Playing Alone. (FireFall was intended for Coop, like any other MMO and solo players will suffer the same thing with this. The game is fun for solo too, but if you play nonstop, then it will become repetitive after a week or so)\n\nThese are bad changes that only early beta/founders feel as negative, it won't change the gameplay for new players.\n\n- Nerfing. (These devs like to nerf classes and when they nerf, they give hell, so it is hard to love 1 class for a very long time, if it gets a nerf the next month, cuz the best thing about it is getting too common)\n- Lack of Random Events. (Random Events are in it and are awesome, however, back in early beta, there were Random Events at every 100m, giving the player unlimited fun, but then they reduced the number of random events and now you only see a couple in a big area)\n- Nerfed Chosen Army. (Back in early beta, when there was an attack of chosens, the fight took well over 30min, everytime the chosens attacked, it felt like you are fighting the battle of the century, the legendary epic super awesome battle for humanity, those Chosens were FEARED by players, but then they got nerfed, yes that hell nerf, and now chosen attacks can be done in 5-10min, chosens' power were also nerfed, they are now just another enemy, not feared, not hated, forgotten...)\n- No Chosen Controlled Areas. (As I said before, back in the days, it was really hard to win a fight against the Chosen army and the game system is that the chosens can take over bases and watchtowers. Everytime I logged in I saw at least 3 bases/watchtowers taken over by chosens and I always went there and tried to take over the base/watchtower with like 20-25 other players, it was like an Epic LoTR battle, but after the devs nerfed the Chosens, everything went down, I havent seen a single base or watchtower taken over by Chosens ever since the nerf...)\n\nAll the negative changes are something that is bad for founders and early beta players, but for new players, those are things that won't bother much... so those things won't affect your gameplay, if you havent experienced them in the early beta/alpha.\n\nI still have a damn good time in FireFall and this game got more potential than most of the MMOs out there. If you have read this and feel that you should not play it, even tho I praised the game like it was a diamond in the MMORPG genre, then still, definitely give it a try, you will like it and you might love it.\n\nFinally, I know I pointed out many negatives, but the positives were all something that can only improve gameplay and the negatives are something that can be brought back into the game anytime.\n\n9.5/10"","July 30, 2014","true","118.4"," 563 of 856 people (66%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","66","563","856","3","4"

Missions are open to anyone.\n-Jetpacks make for a interesting dynamic.\n- The AI has been improved a lot, they hit things!\n-They reward your accomplishments, (each LvL40 gains a perminent stacking+10% exp bonus to your next frame, yes you can have +150% exp on your last frame lol)\n-New Events make for interesting things to do, the seiges or theft events, skyhook or OCT, all are things that people can just jump into and do.\n-At least amazon has action constantly happening and people call out when something is going on.\n\nCons:\n-The game needs its arena/PvP content back badly. The open area pvp needs to be fixed up or taken out and repolaced with jetball.\n-Once you have the Frame you want theres no real reason to level any of the other frames except for perks. and soon we'll have 90 perk points instead of 40.\n-They need to continue the story missions which have been untouched for a long time. :(\n-Materials for Crafting is getting pretty crazy. *Fixed*\n-New content is being worked on and released frequently enough to keep me interested. formally a pro Ive moved this to a con to say that its takes them so long to get this stuff out that my interest drops to the point I log on for maybe an hour or so when Im bored and play but thats it.","December 2, 2014","true","035.2"," 69 of 89 people (78%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","78","69","89","8","0"

By that, I mean there are a lot of almost saving graces. The gameplay is fun, the way frames are made to do something wildly different than most other frames is well done. But that's about where the good parts end. I let my hope get the best of me, and continued playing this and progressed quite far, so I've seen everything the game has to offer at this point, as far as actual content. I have 3 frames yet to unlock, but I think they'll probably remain locked forever, because I'm uninstalling. Let me tell you just a few of the completely broken things in this game.\n\n1) Bugs. This game is filled with bugs, left and right. At time of writing, I cannot login, because the login servers are down- DURING A 4 HOUR LONG EVENT. Which leaves innumerable players (including myself) unable to get the rewards from said event. I wish I hadn't logged out, because I'd at least earned credit for the event. But I figured that since my screen was frozen for up to two minutes at a time (Not a problem on my end; CPU, ram, gfx card all WELL within tolerances) I might restart my computer and see if that helped. Turns out, I can't login at all now. That's just one of countless bugs which plague this game from start to finish.\n\n2) The game is a grindfest. You can't play ONE frame. I mean sure, you get to level 40 with your first frame, "Yay now I can do the 3 endgame raids there are!" Yeah but not well. The thing is that to get the right perks to make your frame actually decent, you need to level up other frames. Some as high as 40, some only to 10, 20, or 30. Regardless, if you want to maximize your play experience, prepare to spend hundreds of hours grinding. This grindfest brings me to....\n\n3) The crafting system. Which is even more of a joke. For one level 40 epic item, the time spent grinding the same thumper in the same zone is maddening. Not to mention the fact that it's not just one zone you'll have to do it in, it's usually two or sometimes all three zones, for different items. 1200 uranium bars, AKA 6000 uranium ore, when you've got a chance at around 100 uranium ore average from a 5 minute long thump. That's for ONE of the materials involved. Bone fragments are much harder to come by, but required in similar numbers. Oh but you can just buy it off the market instead, right?? Lol, sure, if you feel like....\n\n4) MORE GRINDING FOR FREAKING CREDITS. Yup, the main source of credits being injected into the economy, comes from farming crystite(Warfront will get you 15-25k per hour, or would before they nerfed the drop rates). You can convert 25k crystite into 1k credits every day, and you can easily farm 25k crystite in about 1-2 hours, per day, at level 40. But 40 epic abilities? 20-40k credits. 40 epic core? 50-80k credits. So if you wanted to get those credits from just farming crystite, it would be close to a year before you could buy what you wanted to. Luckily, there are other options for gaining credits, it doesn't have to take that long. You could.... grind another frame to 40 and sell the mods from getting level 40. Or you could... grind world mobs on a thumper in hopes of an epic drop that you can sell for the credits to buy an ability for your frame. Have I made the point clear about this game being one long grindfest from start to finish?\n\n5) The content is mediocre at best. There's really a very limited variety in what works in the game. Yes, all the frames work quite differently. On a spectrum from "LOL you're playing THAT frame? /kick" to "Nerf Raptors." I wish I were kidding, but that's how it goes. This is partially mitigated by the fact that all players can play all frames. At 10k +- 3k credits each, or buying them for real money/red beans. But again, if you want to be able to solo thump, and do bane/kana, and do warfront, you're going to need at least 3 frames at 40, probably 4, and if you want them to be perked properly, you're looking at 8-10 frames at level 20-30 or higher, some more frames you won't use at 40, but you have to level just for a perk.\n\n6) PVP is a joke. Broken Peninsula is just that. Broken. The frame imbalances are so severe that if you don't use one of the currently OP frames, you're going to die constantly. Raptor, Rhino, Recluse, maybe a nighthawk, otherwise, get ready to eat lead salad all day long.\n\n7) Devs are very heavy with the nerfbat in areas that don't need it. Especially droprates, which they've nerfed time and again during my time playing. I'm just glad I farmed BWA while it was possible to get more than a single green. They went from a guaranteed two blue "necro" weapons, plus the chance at a green/blue mod or the warpaint, to ONE drop. It might be a green weapon. It might be the warpaint. But you get ONE. Did I mention they reduced the loot, at the same time they made the instance take about twice as long as before? Nerfiest Nerf I ever nerfed. It's not so much harder, as you're not allowed to skip mobs that you could skip before. Other times, they seem to forget the nerfbat exists, like raptors, which are currently the most overpowered frame for just about every situation. Or recluses, which simply gets better the more enemies you throw at it. At some point, the recluse turns immortal, simply because of the fact it is amazing AOE damage, and gets 10% of it's damage as heals. It is just... imbalanced isn't strong enough to describe the way that the frames work.\n\nI dedicated a lot more hours to this game than is reported by Steam, simply because I don't always launch the game through steam. I've played a LOT. And honestly. I wish this game was better. But for all the potential it has, I've seen it going downhill fast during the time I've played. I highly recommend not even installing this game. The gems it has are very visible, and it's easy to get hooked, and then gloss over the "minor inconveniences." But the inconveniences pile up, and when they add something new... be prepared for a crashfest. I personally showed a developer a bug in warfront, soon after it was released. It was one of at least 4 MAJOR and I mean game changing bugs. This particular bug was the difference between a 6 minute objective, and hitting the timer at 20 minutes and everyone dying, and having to wait the 2:30 to attempt the whole objective over again. Which I still don't consider as bad as the bug where the entire raid's game crashes. Both of which took WEEKS to fix (if they even are fixed, they weren't consistent bugs).\n\nI've been addicted to hope in this game for too long. The current staff responsible for the direction the game is heading, and the actual game itself, are incompetent. This game is going downhill fast, and I strongly recommend you stay away from it, unless you like reporting bugs constantly in a game which is *supposed to be* released. I can't stay addicted to hope. For all the good things in it, this game is just bad.","September 21, 2014","false","769.9"," 80 of 109 people (73%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","73","80","109","5","4"

The first few hours of gameplay was confusing as hell, because there was no tutorial for crafting, resource gathering, no information about the story etc.\n\nYet, I dug myself into the game. I wanted to learn it. I poured in it around 200~ hours in open beta. After I understood the mechanics, I was simply sucked in into this world.\n\nIt was a sci-fi shooter, with a moderately deep, but quite hard-to-learn crafting/leveling/gathering system.\n\nThe idea, that\n\n- a player had the choice to thump (mine) 4x4 different kind of materials\n- which each had a quality system from 0 to 1000\n- while you had the option to explore the whole map to get the highest quality for your gear\n- keeping low quality for the "level-ups", which was kinda like the talent-system in vanilla WoW\n- and depending on the quality and property of the material, freely modify what you are about to build\n\nwas fascinating.\n\nIt was hard. There were grindy parts, but the whole game felt like a big cooperation between palyers.

Enjoy my rant.\n\nAh Firefall, one of the few MMO's out there who have shown promise and does it's best to live up to it while other games   cough cough!* Destiny cough cough!   have failed to deliver and as a result developers (and publishers included) over hype it's content.\n\nNow you may ask: "why Firefall? surely there are better MMOs out there!" no, there really aren't. I have played Rift, SWTOR, WoW, Warframe, Runescape the list goes on and none of those MMOs have impressed me in the least. SWTOR is basically WoW with a Star wars coat of paint plagued by EA's greed and Bioware's massive ego. Rift, was 'okay' but it's still WoW with a new skin and nothing more. Warframe was 90% of the time a Dungeon raid grinding simulator plagued by microtransactions and slow progression all set to make more money, and while I am aware the devs must make money to continue development of said game sometimes it can get out of hand.\n\nAnd finally WoW, their business model is a dying animal from 1999 dragged into this modern world hoping for customers. And while WoW is addictive it's community is toxic as hell. If you don't know what I'm talking about I suggest looking up some of the role play.\n\nNow what exactly makes Firefall different from all the rest? Firefall is a F2P FPS/TPS/MMO with of course, jetpacks. It's setting is in the future so it's a sci-fi MMO and that all together is all the reason you need to play it. Why you might ask? because every other MMO out there is trying to be the same thing which is pretty much Dungeons and Dragons. This is a fresh breath of air within the MMO side of gaming that should be explored further, but everyone seems to be quite stupid so let them rot with their WoW clones.\n\nBut this isn't enough information for you to play the game and try it out for yourself. I am explaining this from my opinion, what I should really be doing is giving you the good sides and the bad sides of this game instead of hitting on other games for their lack of creativity.\n\nGameplay:  While Firefall's combat may not hang on button mashing a spell in multiple slots, the combat is no where near perfect. The combat is a little glitchy and tends to be awkward when fighting NPC's due to NPC's "skiing" around with poor animation quality. Which is yet another problem with the combat, the animations need desperate work because it makes indie zombie survival game combat look as fluid as clear water (although it isn't really that bad, but close enough.)\n\nFirst person perspective's animations are just as bad because the view model seems to break quite often either by random chance or exiting large frame drops, so for the most part you'll be playing in Third person. Now don't get me wrong the combat is fun enough to continue playing, but it needs help if it wishes to keep shooter fans such as myself invested.\n\nAnd now for the meat of the game, grinding! because that's fun right!? doing missions over and over and over and over until you get to the next level so you can go to the higher level area and do missions there over and over and over and over again it's so much fun I muted the game!\n\nWhy?! why do dev's think an MMO's primary goal is to drive yourself insane? I don't want to do the same things I did with the last class until I get my next class to 40! Can you guess what you get in return for grinding all the way up to 40?  *plays drumb roll*  if you guessed more grinding then you. are. the WINNNNNNAAAAAH!!! you get to go play Warzones in Devil's Tusk with other overly powerful level 40 players and get boat loads of XP you can't use! But wait! there's more! if you didn't think tedious resource gathering was enough for you, now you can go do tedious resource gathering as enemy players eat your limbs off in seconds while watching them ♥♥♥♥ your family in front of you crying tears of blood! FUN RIGHT?!\n\nHere's a better idea, make the end game worth it. You tortured people all that way just to give them the same thing they were doing at the lower levels but this time far, far, worse! Let's say for example: at the end game you can now get four player special ops missions that require certain skill types such as stealth, distraction, stealing, etc and in return you can get cosmetics or higher chances of getting purple items- something atleast worth leveling to 40. Because I couldn't give a damn about how powerful my character is when all you have to do is stay in the air and fire down death until you complete X Y and Z objectives. Plus mobs can't complain on a forum about how over powered you are so I really can't care about my strength unless fighting in PVP which pretty much boils down to who has the most purple gear anyway...\n\nStoryline:  Ooooooooh boy, I am not going to have fun explaining this. I'll get straight to the point and say it's a poorly written saturday morning cartoon show. The writing is so tasteless it makes me want to dry heave!  Everything  is predictable! for example: "jee, I hope giant crabs from space don't rain on us" *giant crabs from space rain on you* "oh no this was so unpredictable your  armor's power is draining and now you can't fly because reasons...Oh dear, let me bring them back up as slowly as I can." And they do nothing to mix it up. Whatever you do when you play this game, avoid job boards unless you are an achievement hunter.\n\nThe good news is the story can be ignored, the bad news is no one cared enough to make a compelling cast of characters. Yeah, you have your hot hacker chick telling you what to do and a redneck uncle engineer to add as comedy relief but at the end of the day you have no reason to care for these people. Yeah I get it, I'm not expected to care for the virtual characters, but for the sake of the player, at least make them half decent.\n\nThe plus side however, most MMOs don't have voice acting at all. Of course games like WoW have shop dialogue "oy! come to sell yer ♥♥♥♥ son?" "I buy and sell ♥♥♥♥" "hurry up on over here so I can buy your ♥♥♥♥" "I sell quality ♥♥♥♥ at the ♥♥♥♥♥iest price!" But the majority of it is text, it's not like I hate reading but when the entire game has a weak plot and a crappy UI I have already lost interest at level 1. So Red5 get's points for placing honest effort into it.\n\nFinal Verdict  So what are the good things I can say about this game? well it's free, you can unlock everything within the game for free if you are willing to work for it, and it has a great community as well as developers. But the glitches and the lack of content is what holds me back from speaking positively about this game.\n\nIt's not like I didn't try to like this game! I really wanted to enjoy Firefall, and I still do, but it's a love/hate relationship. I have 322 hours on record as proof that I enjoyed the game enough to soldier through it's flaws and eventually write a review on it. And in return I give Firefall a 6/10, it's above 5 because it is trying to be a good MMO that doesn't constantly try to harpoon your wallet every chance it gets like most MMO's I have played. Now do I suggest you install FF right now? well, the in game music is broken, the UI is always glitching (it can even go as far as restarting your game) and this cannot be fixed via hotfix. Despite that go ahead and install it if you have the space for it otherwise move along.","April 11, 2015","false","347.1"," 191 of 300 people (64%) found this review helpful 42 people found this review funny","64","191","300","42","29"

Its centerpiece is supposedly a world war between a besieged humanity and a superior alien civilization, but players spend most of the time roaming around engaging random clumps of indigenous bandits, mining for resources, and killing mutated fauna. There is a lack of sense about the relevancy or urgency of the war.\n\nLeveling mechanics, itemization, crafting, and questing systems are conventional and unremarkable. Narratives conveyed in missions are discontinuous, because the missions themselves are randomly sequenced. The encounter system is simplistic: most scenarios reduce to close-range engagements as enemies materialize into existence near you. Enemy AI is mediocre: No squad tactics, no flanking, no suppression, no cover. Combat is mostly reduced to jumping and backpedaling away from enemies. It becomes less about surviving enemies, and more about surviving the point-blank splash damage from your own weapons.\n\nPlay it for the eye candy and esthetics, and for the easy adrenaline. Look elsewhere for more filling and better execution. Intelligently challenging PVE battles, cohesive narratives, and a world story that invites urgency elude Firefall at this time.","July 30, 2014","false","37.2"," 93 of 138 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","93","138","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/snakewildlife/recommended/227700/","snakewildlife","Snake Wildlife","http://steamcommunity.com/id/snakewildlife/","335 products in account","Review and tips focused towards new players, i am a beta player with over 2 years test experience in this title.\n----\n\nFirst off, you need to know that this 3rd person shooter is also a MMO experience, so keep in mind you need to grind levels and components, a lot of time is needed to play this game, and with how the system works (and a good point i might add) is that you cant just sit there and leech from other people, you physically need to participate to gain XP and credit. So be prepared for a long-lasting (but awesome) experience so long as youre someone who enjoys actually playing the game and not just ya know..sat leeching from someone or not giving a crap.\n\n***Gameplay: 7 / 10\nThe content is good, the single player missions are good, the different variations of World events and randomly generated content work great! The only problem is, there's not enough different types of mission and it can quickly become repetetive, which goes the same for story missions, theyre enjoyable but there just isnt enough of them (yet). I highly recommend playing with friends especially if they can give you a ride, or (i highly advise) you puchase with Red Beans of ingame Credits, a BIKE. Without a vehicle this game is a looong walk simulator, but as soon as you get a vehicle and craft yourself a lot of 1-use glider pads this mobility problem goes away (it sorta forces you to get a vehicle, but thats ok they need to make money somehow to sustain these big servers).\nPvE Content is very well balanced and challenging, if you charge into a base full of bandits or chosen at your level, expect to get yourself killed very quickly as especially the Chosen, are a force to be reconned with. PvP is promising but ultimately, there's no balance and its only fun for the few. The classes you are allowed to play cover all the basic roles (tank, support, healer, dps etc) and the advanced battleframes (which i recommend Bastion, Dragonfly/Recluse, Raptor/Nighthawk or Mammoth for new players as these currently seem the most powerful) grant even further power to your class.\nThey have confirmed, and are adding a lot of content in the future including a level cap rise with (confirmed) at least 2 new world-zones, so expect a LOT of good things for this free-to-play title.\n\n***Sound: 7 / 10\nThe music feels very gripping with its orchestral quality and all weapons sounds great, you really feel the oomph of your weaponry and explosions from afar you can almost feel the vibrations from. Sound quality is excellent! Though the roaming music can sorta make you a bit sleepy. The musical score is wonderful in missions and cutscenes but the roaming music is too boring. The game's vocal content and all NPC's (and quest givers) is about 97% fully voice acted! Some of those accents though are not very well spoken, and may sounds a bit cheesy, several of the voice actors seem uninterested but overall, sound is good.\n\n***Graphics and worlds: 5 / 10\nThe maps look average and the systems overal graphics are well toned (character style inspired from Street Fighter 4). I wouldnt call firefall next-gen, its sorta in between last gen and next gen. It's optimized enough to run smoothly including in huge fights of 40 players and a hundred enemies at once on the screen (which is amaaaaziiiiing) but GPU Temperatures can run a little high so i highly recommend turning a few things down (shadows low or off, and antialiasing off unless your computer is an icecube). The worlds although they looks pretty, (gunna be honest here) will p### you off, as every obstacle, every mountain with no climbable surface, every tree/rock/nook and granny and just how lumpy the ground is, seems to do its utmost best to slow you down and hinder your ability to go someplace, which is why they sell glider-pads in game to make money off of you. Because of the terrible pathing in maps and how it fights and pushes you to the point of frustration when youre trying to be in a rush to go someplace, it heavily impacts this rating. The maps by design are agonizing.\n\n***Overall: 7 / 10\nThere's a lot of potential here, keep in mind you DO have to spend some money if you want to get anywhere near end-game here because of long distance traveling and the advanced battleframes being stronger (mostly), but with the extra content coming, the community being really supportive of Firefall, and the playerbase being really co-operative and nice in game, i highly recommend this title.\nRemember, it's free-to-play, but if you want to get serious about this game, you will need to spend a little money OR, spend a lot of time. Recommended: Get a vehicle, unlock the class you really want to play, tryout a 100% XP boost to get out of the first 10 boring levels and BOOM! You got yourself a really fun game, with great PvE experiences, and a solid future.","July 28, 2014","true","447.2"," 236 of 380 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","236","380","0","0"

I jumped on board the list, and a few months later, got in. I'll tell you, was a very new experience from that very beginning, and it has changed A LOT since then. From gameplay, to rpg elements, to crafting, to missions, to being Esports to now focused on PvE (which from my perspective was great idea, cause pvp isn't my cup of tea), and how you're introduced to the world. I almost want to say that first major year of PvE they had was part of their progressing story idea. They have an entire new area now that was "captured" by players a few weeks ago (of this posting). I've spent many hours on this, then took a break for a few months for them to work out a few more things, cause was getting very complex and broken, especially crafting and items. But hearing them finally annouce a launch, I had to come back and see the changes, and boy was I impressed.\n\nClass explanation: They went back to some classic rpg elements with their twists. A full level 1-40 system each with a white, green, blue, purple rarity system. Note that each class, battleframe, will start at level 1, even if you unlock the next "tier" of a frame. The 5 main frames are assault (blow ♥♥♥♥ up with a cannon, no seriously, a plasma cannon), dreadnaught (my fav, the tank, and mower of enemies), biotech (new version of medic, which yes isn't fully heal spec), recon (sniper), and the engineer (the engineer... it's a great frame, turrets and support stations). Now each has their own unique abilities and perks that you unlock as you level from 1-10, only 3 or 4, but they work so well that you wouldn't want more, tho you are able to take teir 1 abilities to their teir 2 version, which spreads to two difference classes each for a total of 10 new frames after tier 1. So that's basics, I'd recommend messing around with all before choosing main "class" and then their next tier.\n\nStory: Now about the story. Co-written by Orson Scott Card... that's right, creater of Ender's Game is helping write the story to Firefall, and boy does it deliever. A semi-typical apocalypse story... actually the only typical about it is the word apocalypse. The "Firefall" was started by a asteroid circling around earth, causing all the satelites to fall to earth, causing mass chaos and civil wars and near world wars for resourses to survive. That was until the asteroid finally crashed into earth, destroying japan (japan is just the worst place to live in btw), and someone looked at the crash site, finding the new element crystite. With it's discovery, humanity's power came back, and it's structure jumped our technology. We unified under the United Nations of the Accord We then wanted more, and found it's origin on the planet Alpha Prime. Sending ships took 7 years back and forth (that's 14 total so you understand the math), actually some ships even longer, so we experimented with crystites power to "fold" space. Thus the Arclight was built. A massive ship, a dreadnaught to the Accord fleet, with it's Arcfold Drives was preparing to test this new technology, and change humanity forever... in all the wrong ways. As the jump was "complete", it failed, and tore a hole in space. The Arclight crashed into Forteleza Brasil, killing everyone who lived there... but the worst to happen was what emmerged from the tear... The Melding. A purple cloud of energy that destroyed and morphed our world. The melding covered everything, and anyone caught in it was killed or worse turned into humanoids known as The Chosen, who now hunt the remnants of earth's population. The only thing stopping the melding from eating everything, was the arclight's drives still functioning... for 5 years, everyone has been scavaging to survive. Mining crystite from earth's soil, and the Accord fighting off the chosen, but it wasn't enough.\n\nOur Role: This is where we the player come in. We are the ARES Initiative, mercenaries hired by the accord to do the jobs the Accord can't do alone. They give us a battleframe and send us off into the world. Fighting back, chosen, the morphed wildlife, and even bandits as we all know, people get greedy and desperate near the end. There is much lore within this game, and an amazingly detailed world full of verticality, as you are given "jump jets" to climb higher areas. So explore, mine, craft, hunt, and become the ultimate badass as you discover the secrets of the chosen and the threat they pose, corperations fighting each other, and the threats of this altered earth have to offer you.\n\nI'm loving where this game is going and has gone, it's still a bit buggy and needs work here and there, but otherwise, try it out, it's free, why wouldn't you? You don't need to even feel bad about never spending a dime on their game :)\nThough believe me, you'll find something you'll like. I've also only scratched the surface of content in my review, cause there is a bunch. I've labeled about.... maybe 1/8th to 1/10th of the game really. Seriously, come join when you can.\n\nEdited: Didn't realize I'd get a bunch of views. I feel like I should say more. I realized I didn't say any disclaimers, though the game being free to play kinda throws those out right? not really... with that said. This game is going for AAA graphics, and indeed it delievers, meaning you'll need a fairly powerful machine. I'm using a Nvidia GT 555M, so you realize that my computer is way behind it's time, though 6 Gbs of RAM and an i7 cpu help. However, the game still runs great, runs near 30 fps on low/medium graphics with a few times dropping to, and even then the game still surpasses in graphics. The game will give you a warning in the login if you have below recommended hardware.\n\nAlso, gameplay may feel a bit... repetetive, because most missions are kill a certain amount then collect and item, or find a person and escort them, the typical missions in all MMOs. However, there are other missions that randomly spawn on the map, such as turning off a bomb, which requires you to find keys and put them in at the correct time. While also being attacked left and right by enemies. Though I think what this game excells at that most free-to-play games fail at, is that the combat is fun. It's great to unload hundreds of bullets of your machine gun, or blast them apart with your plasma cannon, or blow enemies away with your abilities. It's simple, but competative, and just enough of a challenge that will keep you moving around dodging enemy fire or claws. I've died plenty of times, I've run out of ammo on my main weapon even more (which is why your secondary is near unlimited ammo), these enemies are pretty smart (though I'd argue a little more work can be done to make them perfect) and they find many ways to kill you or ruin your objective.\n\nSo again I'll say, this game still needs work. I will say it's at a launch stage, and the more people discovering it and finding all the bugs will help the developers even more. By the way, these guys listen to you. I haven't had as good customer support as from Red5. Every time I sent an email with requests and bug finds, I'd get a personal email from them, I've even got into some nice conversations with them. Now of course not all my requests were met, as they shouldn't be. They have their idea to this game and we shouldn't mess with that... too much. They have met their goal of launching the game they wanted, and they only want to add more for us.\n\nAgain this is where we come in, the more we play, the more invested they're in. The more the community grows, the more fun they'll have making. So just try the game, it won't hurt you, and you might actually come to love it like I do.","July 26, 2014","true","66.7"," 149 of 242 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","149","242","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hano0k/recommended/227700/","hano0k","no0k","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hano0k/","106 products in account","Let's start with the bad since that's probably the first thing many people will notice before they can adequately give it a chance:  this game is a buggy mess.  At one point in my first week of playing the social network went down for about an hour or so, so there were no squads, no local chats, no zone chats, no private chats.  That was...interesting for an MMO.  Also count in the sheer amount of times youll have to /rui or simply relog on the game and it's easy to see more than a few problems with this "new" release.  One other thing I wasn't particularly impressed with was the voice acting.  Some of the higher 'brass' sounds like little more than some doughboy CS developer-type guy.  Some of the voice acting simply sounds LAZY, where you expect the person you're reporting to to at least SOUND like he/she commands some sort of air of authority.  Additionally, more than a few of the accents sound forced.  OK so fair enough, this game didn't cost me anything to download but spacetime.  Despite the issues, this game has a LOT of redeeming qualities and so now we'll move on to why I recommend it.\n\nWhile the level cap is low for an MMO (currently only 40; I've gotten a little more than halfway there at this point in time), Red 5 offers within Firefall a world lush with touristic scenery (the first town, Copacabana, is similar to an island vacation destination), Borderlands-esque graphics (cell-shading) and gameplay, and random bad guys including oversized bugs (giving it a Starship Troopers kind of feel at times), various rebel factions, and a cult of sorts that goes by the name of the Chosen.  In this world, the "Melding" has descended after a massive semi-apocalyptic event called the "Firefall", spawning the Chosen and as an ARES mercenary it's your inevitable destiny to push this purple tyranny back into the shadowy depths from which it came.  As someone who just hit their 20's in game, I don't know if there's ever an overall resolution towards this problem but I'm sure having a good time getting to that end point.\n\nAs you level up, there are several towns for almost every level range so location diversity is never really a problem.  Each of these towns has it's own job board which supplies you with a set of level appropriate gopher/defense missions to help you level.  There's also a main string of campaign quests that you steadily unlock as you level up that add to the story of the war against the Melding.  In some of these missions you actually push the melding back by activating a SIN Uplink in the area (so THAT's what those are for!).\n\nIn your time spent playing Firefall, there are several other things to do if you don't like the mainstream find/grind missions.  Several random missions occur in your local area, ranging from melding tornados (around level 15-20 it seems are the lowest ones you can find) that you have to spend some time shooting down to random LGVs and Thumpers crashing down in your area which you can save for a decent chunk of xp and resources.  Sometimes Chosen dropships like to pay visits to SIN Uplinks in towns or at watchtowers and attack/take them over, after which it's team ARES' responsibility to liberate and take back the area.\n\nUsing Thumpers in itself is another gem of this game's overall existence.  Yet another choice while exploring the world is to scout out mineral nodes that randomly spawn throughout.  Find a node, call down your thumper, and prepare to defend it for the next 5 minutes while it mines resources for you and bugs are trying to destroy it.  A successful thump gets you xp and resources based on the % of the minerals present in the area you're thumping.  An unsuccessful thump sees your thumper destroyed, but that's OK!  You can just craft another one!\n\nCrafting is one area of the game that seems a bit overwhelming at first, but it actually ends up fitting into the game quite nicely for those higher teens and lvl 20+ areas.  Almost everything you pick up is salvagable, which gets you research points, crystals, and refinable materials that can later be used in crafting.\n\nMobility EARLY game is KIND of an issue, but not really.  For the most part you'll be walking around everywhere until level 25 when you get a reusable ground vehicle, but there are some alternatives.  1-use ground vehicles drop from quests and I believe they're also craftable if you so desire.  In addition to the possibility of ground vehicles you have the entire hang gliding system which is it's own source of entertainment, not to mention a much quicker way to get places.  I especially enjoy climbing the highest mountains (there are achievements for climbing these mountains as a matter of fact) and spawning a glider pad to fly off of them.  Some of these mountains literally make it possible to fly clear across a region from one side to the other, just don't fly near the Arclight! :D\n\nAs far as replayability is concerned, you don't have to ever create a new character if you don't want to.  All the different classes are separated by what are known as "battleframes" in game, which one can change not unlike a shirt or some other equippable article of clothing.  Now, each time you equip a new frame you haven't played before it starts at level 1 but all the early missions are replayable for xp/resource credit.  I should also mention that starting out as a free player you only get access to the  5 different accord frames, which are the basic frames in each of the 5 different battle classes.  Here's the beauty of this particular free2play game, though:  you don't ever have to spend a dime of your real money in game to get everything there is to get, it might just take a while longer.  There is always the option of buying stuff for those that are impatient and want to try out some of the elite frames sooner rather than later, like me.  Bought Electron and Bastion on the first night.\n\nAll-in-all, I do recommend this game.  It has a lot of potential.  It's very engaging; the gameplay is moderately-paced and 3-dimensional based in a wide-open world.  Listening to the soundtrack is often pretty relaxing.  This game also does have PvP, though I've spent next to no time exploring that particular venue cause there's so much other fun stuff to do in PvE that, quite refreshingly, doesn't seem so repetitive.  Even the campaign missions you unlock changes up the scenery and the objective in each one so it's not simply a generic mission formula.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/squidsahoy/recommended/227700/","squidsahoy","SquidsAhoy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/squidsahoy/","287 products in account","A study in game design theory, Firefall is a title that is fantastic on paper and mediocre in practice.  Most of what's present is forgivable, but the primary attraction is ultimately its biggest liablity.  Ultimately, it won't appeal to MMO fans due to it's watered down questing and pve mechanics, and action fans will dismiss it due to a lack of refinement.\n\nFirefall's story revolves around the discovery of meterological elements that allow us to build fantastic technology, such as jet pack suits, advanced weapons, and space ships.  The goal of traveling to an Earth like planet is foiled by further plot mechanics, as the ship crashes into Earth, rendering most of the surface uninhabitable.  The obligitory aggressive alien species comes to Earth to take over, and this sets the stage for blah blah blah.\n\nPoorly written sci fi tropes doesn't compel a player to continue on with the story, so the game heavily relies on the action elements.  These are where the biggest problems manifest, because the actual meat of the game is mediocre at best.  The game has a one to one action component, which is unusual for MMO's as it's a genre that caters to point and click, but Firefall tries desperately to stand out.  Instead it feels like a mechanically stripped down shooter with very little to differentiate itself from the hundreds of other FPS games, and strapping a jet pack to your character does very little to help.\n\nThe actual physics of flying feel so static and boring that it really shouldn't have bothered.  Instead of using it as a method to travel quickly from place to place, it simply allows for altitude adjustments, and has very little “skiing”, something that the tribes games were lauded for.  Strategically, it's still important for melee centric enemies as you'll jet above them and shoot as they attempt with great futility to nibble your ankles.  If an inertial effect was added to the jetting the game would be a pleasure, especially with the varied terrain.  As is, moving from point A to B in the game is a chore.\n\nProduction values crush what enjoyment could have been gleaned from the rest of this game, as the graphics, sound, interface, and general design are adequate, but that's it.  The view distance for terrain, monsters and allies is good, but up close they look pretty meh.  This is in no small part due to an unusual cartoonish design, somewhere between Borderlands and World of Warcraft, but nowhere near as endearing as either.  It comes off as generic and unexciting, with little if anything unique about it.  Enemy design suffers the most, as it isn't just dull, it only has a handful of variations.  In about 3 hours of gameplay, I had seen the same arachnid design used for about half the enemies, and zombie like enemy soldier for the other.  From the sound of a machine gun to rockets firing, to my commander speaking to the lowly civilians, everything sounds awful.  The voice acting especially is cringe worthy, with the theater commander taking the prize for most obnoxious line delivery this year.\n\nPotential is squandered on a regular basis in the gaming industry, but rarely had expectations been so high; a 1 to 1 action mmo with jetpacks, a pvp component, and a free to play model.  All that's left is an excellent case study in how design doesn't necessarily equate to execution.  Firefall isn't terrible, it's just a really basic, stripped down action game that just happens to have an MMO component tacked on.  Both are incredibly basic and unrefined, and leaves very little to entice fans of either genre.  In the end, it really isn't worth your time unless major improvements are made.\n","August 4, 2014","false","2.5"," 214 of 356 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","214","356","0","12"

Yes this game had a rocky start, yes it didn't deliver right away and yes it used to be very buggy. But the team shows true love for their game and has been constantly upping the ante and making this a game that gets more and more fun. I think the developers are doing a truly admirable job turning this game around and delivering a very satisfying and addictive game. The free to play concept is worked out quite honestly while at the same time leaves some room to splurge on a few nice extra's. Just walking around, enjoying the scenery, questing and chasing random events is a fun, and if done properly, fast way to build a few nice characters. Atmosphere is great and as a busy man with not too much free time this is a really nice way to spend a few hours once in a while.

This game has been reworked about four times now. Even after kicking that idiot Mark Kern to the curb, development still has absolutely no direction whatsoever.\n\nMost of the balance changes are actually decent. However, this latest update disabled a lot of features because suprise, they're being reworked. For the fifth time. Also, end game zones? Being reworked as well, so good luck finding stuff to do at max level, especially since thumping is no longer fun in the slightest.\n\nFor those who played before, remember the arsenal frame? It had pretty decent firepower with its LMG, and abilities granted weapons with limited ammo to be used in certain situations. A shotgun with high damage, a particle beam for long range AOE, and so on. Its ultimate was great, my favorite one in the game. Ever see Macross? The mechs which could fire off a ton of missiles at once? Basically that, though the rockets here arc like mortar fire. And it was AWESOME!\n\nSounds like a cool frame, right? Well, it's gone. Just removed completely because the developers are too stupid to figure out how to bolster its shortcomings. And not one single frack was given when people who loved it clamored for it back. They did offer pretty nice compensation, but as cool as the vehicle is, I'd rather have my Arsenal back.\n\nSave your time and energy for something else. This game could have been wonderful, but they spent far too much time just figuring out what they wanted this game to be... and still are!\n\nIf you must try, I'd recommend not spending any real money. Let's face it, the game and Red5 are on its last legs. I'm actually surprised it's lasted this long, especially after its abysmal failure in Asia. I really don't think they'll make it to the end of 2016.\n\nNeed to get your shooter fix? There are plenty of better offerings on Steam. Go try one of those, and leave this game to die.\n\nBTW my play time was mostly using the proprietary launcher, not Steam.

Given it didn't have much content, but it was always updating and the story was opening up. I would've given the game a 7.5/10 score.\nIt's been a long time now and I have played a good chunk of time again, and I am sorely disappointed.\n* It's full of bugs and glitches that aren't typically fixed. Some are, most are not.\n* Updates don't always fix what's broken and they include what the community has called 'Ninja Updates' that they intentionally hide so as to try and avoid confrontation from their playerbase.\n* A game once made to reward skill and strategy is now just "Who can do the more AoE damage". Skill is no longer a thing. The deadliest and most used classes are AoE classes, aside from Dragonfly healers of course.\n* PvP is more or less dead. Now the PvP zone sees only the occasional battle but is more or less quiet and only for getting materials.\n* The game is horribly optimized. Beefy computers can see lag. Amazing connections will still see latency problems.\n* The phrase "Don't fix what isn't broken" is often seen in action.\n* Most of the crafting in the game is worthless. You can skip over it till endgame and not suffer for it much at all.\n* Just to keep up with most of the playerbase, you have to play for weeks to get daily rewards just to get VIP status to earn enough in-game currency to do anything.\n\nI tried to enjoy the game and even joined an army (guild, clan, whatever you wanna call it) and ran around with them but it was already too late. I had seen the game poisoned for me beyond repair.\nNow I rate this game 3/10. It's a waste of time.\nAs far as I am concerned, the only reason this game is still alive is because they have something that hasn't been done better yet. If someone came up with a game similar to this and actually did it justice, I would probably be all over it and I doubt there wouldn't be masses of players wanting in on it too.\n\nTL;DR - This game isn't worth the headache, the time sink or the urge to pay into the game just to get a leg-up. Skip it over and wait for something better.","November 17, 2014","false","261.8"," 31 of 42 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","31","42","2","0"

I didn't get to play Firefall again till it was on steam a week or so ago.\n\nThey took most, if not all, the fun out of this game. The areas are level based now, I remember being able to roam the whole map just about. The random events are gone as far as I can see. No more invasions by the melting or chosen, I remember watchtowers being attacked all the time, and random invasions here and there; don't see any happening now. The crashed thumpers and LGV's are still here, but seem to be fewer than before to me.\n\nThen there's the crafting and reaserch. There wasn't any research when I was playing beta. I don't mind it, but they put in TOO much; it needs to be combined and have AT LEAST 50% of it cut out. Either that or make a lot of other ways to get reaserch points other than savalaging, or reduce the points costs as well. And what happened to all the minerals? There's nothing but sand/dirt and iron now that I found around the starting area, there used to be at least a third mineral too around the starting area.\n\nI also remember a horizontal skill/gear/weapon tree that you got a point (or whatever) to spend on every level up for a frame; that was option based, as in every level of the tree had at least two choices (such as between two weapons, a weapon or skill, booster/gear item or something else, and etc.) and you could always wait another level to get the second (or other choices) if you wanted both (or all). There was also a particular "upgrade" path to advanced frame 1 or advanced frame 2, so you could get to an better frame quick if so wanted, or both advanced frames.\n\nAnd there's durablity now, and for EVERYTHING? Wasn't in the beta and we don't need it.\n\nI'd really like to know wtf happened to this game, it was so much better in the beta when I played it. Which is usually the opposite of betas/games I've played, usually the beta sux more so then the release for a game; but not this time, firefall beta was much better then released firefall.","July 29, 2014","false","30.7"," 263 of 450 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","263","450","0","11"

That it was great while it lasted? Those are the words that should be said for an awesome game that's closing its doors for the final time; celebrations of the life of a community and good game that ran for well over a decade. I had a few of these experiences. Phantasy Star Online for example was one of these, (the first one mind you. There's still Private Servers, but no point since PSO2 exists). I played a few other little MMOs here and there in my youth. In 2012, I found this awesome game called FireFall, and fell completely in love with it. It had the makings for an awesome story, awesome gameplay/gunplay, it was an MMO and an FPS combined... and something like this was new to me. Hell, it was one of the firsts... by which I mean if I point my gun at something and pull the trigger, it dies. No tab-targeting to be seen.\n\nI was a founding Commander too even. Watched the game grow during the early days of beta. You could go anywhere in the world, you could shoot whatever moved... there was actual things to do. Pretty sandbox-y for those early days. I remember spending a couple good years with this one group... well, several groups actually, although with this one community army, I could never really get into it offically... so I just operated as an outside agent. It was the game that got me to buy my first graphics card since I wasn't really big on the PC market back then... so I can thank Firefall for that. The other group, we had a teamspeak and good times. Sure it was a little rough... but I'm generally pretty chill. Good times were had, before that got broke up; this of course being after everyone else had quit... the game became stagnant due to a MAJOR flaw; the developers at Red5 Studios were rebuilding the game from the ground-up, so that left us with little-to-no updates outside of hotfixes. They'd started this whole entire promotional bit with a bus (which is sitting in a warehouse somewhere now), prizes to be given out for their Founder Packs (which were available for a good year or so), and no actual NEW content. No new guns or gun designs, no new Battleframes; nothing.\n\nThen comes a new update that kills PvP off (which was fine for me since I didn't play it anyway), which was pretty lackluster to begin with... adds some new zones to teleport to which didn't let you go very far. They rebuilt crafting, and progression to a near-unplayable level. For example.... you could have this really nice Tier 3 Plasma Cannon (Assault), but then you can't get anything else.. abilities, armor, servos... nothing. Or you could kit out your plating and become a little bit better than paper mache (READ: tinfoil), but then you couldn't kit out anything else because of constraints. Math went in and between a few people collabing together, they figured out it'd take 13.5 years to max out.... one Battleframe. ONE. Not all 15... just one.\n\nWell, come later on and after enough hell-raising, instead of fixing the stupidly-high progression requirement ceiling (they reduced it a little bit but not by much), they spend more time with their Twitch streams and social garbage such as Red 5 TV... and rebuild the game yet a second time. More waiting... more time spent... and still as friends left, I stuck with it. I stuck by them... and little did we know that Red 5 was pretty turbulent internally; all the senior staff had been fired off at this point, The9 which was the people funding Red 5 at this point had a complete strangle-hold on them at this point, and returns were being requested. They booted out Mark Kern... one of the main CEOs of Red 5 (READ: the guy who FOUNDED Red 5 in the FIRST place!!), and hired another guy to lead development for a little while.\n\nProgress got quicker, and then Open Beta hits... after 2½ years it finally hits and people are estatic. They added a new Battleframe which was pretty cool... until I figured out how bad it was. It was called "Arsenal" which was this hulking Frankenstein-esque junk frame thrown together from various other frame abilities and parts, made fat as an insult, and carried a pretty poor LMG with did crap-all to anything you shot at.. and its abilities were poor imitations of other weapons which didn't even last but a few seconds, a butchered Engineer "Salvo Proxy" called some sort of new lame ability and made its ultimate. That's right... ultimates replaced the fourth ability... which had turned this game's skill system into that of a damn MOBA's abilities (three boring abilities, one half-decent ability)... which seemed great at first for the other abilities, until they changed those too! They kept throwing nerfs about, making the enemies stupid-hard, and making us stupid-weak. No skill anymore, just the feeling of being curb-stomped into the ground over and over.\n\nAnother half-year in Open Beta, and finally comes the 1.0 release... but not before yet ANOTHER rebuild of the game. Now we're reduced to levels (in which the only frame I ever was able to play; Accord Assault) insta-leveled to the cap of 40 due to all the XP it had obtained, and a semi-linear storyline. There's still open-world stuff to do, and everything. And surprisingly... my best friend decided to come back! And a new generation of people joined us in the new community I was a part of (READ: Still am, still proud. PG forever, I tell you what), and together... we completely dominated the game. The fun was back, with stuff to do and new places to visit... although those older places (Area Y; Jungle, Area Z; Antarctica) were still on hold..........\n\nUnfortunately... good times have to end I suppose. Eventually, things got pretty bleak after more members of Red 5 got let go. The9 was increasing its grip on the company from what the community could see; what with Reddit being that thing that seems to bring out the best and worst in people (though I don't use it myself; I can read, however), Various AMAs from disgruntled employees who were struggling at this point to survive (For example, Tony Reyas whom I had spoken to personally a few times while he still worked there... good guy that one.), and talks of yet ANOTHER rebuild of the game (We had gone through three-four at this point? I lost count years ago)....\n\nAnd so now we arrive at what I could only describe as the Chrono Trigger-variant of post-Apocalypse 2300 as far as this company goes, (if you want, you can listen to that piece of the soundtrack... it's called "2300 A.D."). The last Firefall Live was quite some time ago, last year in 2015 if I recall... they don't even use their studio for it anymore (which looked pretty "repo'd" to me). Most of the CEOs are gone now. There might be someone there but I have only loosely followed the game and the resources of the company at this point... as I've moved on. I was a mentor for the longest; still am... had life issues to take care of course, but there... there's just no point anymore in worrying about it. At this point, the forums are dead and broken (see the following screenshot[puu.sh]), the community is completely divided and broken, the devs don't bother speaking to us anymore except for FadedPez (AKA: Frank Lettieri... I salute you, you poor soul) who is already attempting to hold everything together with what appears to be some lint, some cloth string, and scotch tape.\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n(More in the comments)","May 29","false","640.0"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","8"

Crafting and the endgame zones have been removed and still havn't been put back in, and plenty of other changes people are unhappy with have been implemented. Everything I liked and cared about in the game has been removed.

You could find first graders who could design a better early game leveling than a zone full of 40 long boring escort missions that are exactly the same but randomized lengths from 10 yards to 5 miles.

The game starts you off landing on copacobana, a resort town surrounded by a beach on one side and a forest on the other. You have multiple battleframes to choose from to suit your play style, such as the assault, recon, or the engineer. With each battleframe you get to max level you can unlock a advanced frame that sports new abilities and access to a new primary weapon.\nThe world allows you to reach max level without touching a job board do to the abunance of ares missions that are scattered around the map. They will give you as much if not more experience than doing a job board mission in a fraction of the time, however the game is a huge grindfest and gets downright aggravating at times.\nThe gameplay is alot like a watered down borderlands mixed with warframe. You fight dangerous wildlife, rouge bandits, and the infamous chosen which is humanitys main foe. There is not a whole lot to do in the game besides grind, grind, and grind some more.  After leveling my second battleframe I tried yet again to begin leveling another battleframe, but i couldn't bring myself to go through the tedious grind for a third time.\nWhen i was reading chat, every now and then the conversation would lean toward talking about the beta and how great it was compared to the way it is now. I did not have the chance to play the beta, but then i think i would be even more dissapointed in the game like so many others who have played and reviewed this game. It is very repetive, lacks content, and is honestly a snoozefest that couldn't keep my interest.

But if you're a veteran like I am, playing this game again will just get you thinking about the "Good ol' days". At least it did for me.\n\nI really wanted to be able to give this game a positive review. I wanted it more than anything else in the world. It has so many good memories for me, and when I first played in the summer of 2013 near the end of the closed beta, I remember thinking that it the most fresh and innovative MMO that I had seen in a long time. (Granted, I'm sort of an antisocial person, so I tend to hate MMOs because I don't play too well with others.) But since I picked it back up a few weeks ago, I can only say that things have gotten worse since I last played, which was about a month after the Sertao patch first went live.\n\nEven then, I thought FireFall was going down a negative slope-- but back then I thought it was either just a fluke that would be fixed in the next few patches, or because I had simply burned myself out by playing it too much. But now it's become clear that Red5 has fallen so far that they can't recover. Especially after the buyout by the Chinese company "The Nine", (Which sounds like the name of a terrorist faction in a cyberpunk movie, by the way.) and when you take the time to consider that the members of Red5 that recieved the money basically immediately blew it all on hats. It kinda shows how little respect and care they had left for their own game near the end.\n\nAs for the quality of gameplay, like I said before, it's been on a negative slope for a while, but I only just noticed how steep the slope was. The open world experience overall used to be much better. There wasn't a set level barrier between areas or even strict "levels" at all. The whole world was open to anyone at any power level, and you could proceed and explore at your own pace. If you ♥♥♥♥ed up and went somewhere too strong for you, that was your own mistake. Now the zones (Coral Forest, Sertao and Diamond Head) have fallen back into the classic MMO mistake of being segmented and cordoned off into areas with seperate level requirements. It really cockblocks the fun factor of exploring this game and forces you back into grinding in one spot until you're strong enough to move on rather than growing through exploration. Back in MY day, anyone could go to Sunken Harbor any time they wanted, but now it's a level 30+ zone.\n\nThe quality of the quests has seen a sharp decrease as well. Except it's not even consitent. The old ARES missions that have been here since the summer of 2013, and even the first 25% of the main questline are still pretty fun and well designed. The remaining 75% of the main quest and the new open world missions, however... Well, it's obvious where Red 5 dropped off and The Nine picked up. Even based off of voice acting quality alone and ignoring the rest of the missions. The bad voice acting was funny for about 15 minutes but then it made me die a little bit inside after I realized why. That being said, the new "missions" are also horribly broken and glitchy. Overpowered bosses, convoluted objectives that could just be replaced with something so simple as a door key, et cetera. I was having troubles defeating a level 20 boss in my level 45 armor because of how broken he was. I've also heard complaints from guildmates (who are also veterans in maxed out armors) about the exact same mission near the end of the questline (which I have failed to make it to because of a game breaking bug earlier in the campaign). The9, convolutedness isn't a substitute for balanced difficulty at higher levels.\n\nLike I said, I wish that I could have given this a good review. I really wanted to. Despite its greatly increasing flaws, this game is still very unique, especially in the F2P MMO scene. With its true 3D movement mechanic and diversity between classes, FireFall's potential was immense. But now when I look it all I see is what could have been and what soon won't be. One of my favorite games is circling the drain, and it's breaking my heart.","May 30","false","115.4"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","0"

Team cooperation for random encounters and bosses was encouraged, and a PvE environment allowed a friendly, and helpful community to thrive.\nThe premium currency in this game is a wonderful thing to have to quicken the rate in which you advanced through the game, but wasn't a necessity.\nThe art style didn't knock my socks off, but it worked with their futuristic, yet sort of leisurely, and laid-back feel of the environment. It was in a Post-Apocalyptic scenario, so I wish the game's storyline would cohere with a darker, more serious tone, to prevent the game from looking like a "Paradise Paintball" a bunch of pre-teens would play.\n\nWhat disappointed me, and led to the desertion of this game that I once thoroughly enjoyed, was the lack of apparent progression. The developers seemed to have forgotten to polish some key aspects of MMO's that made them fun. Levels, new abilities, and gear did not provide any distinct differences in playstyle, and offered little pleasure in using.\nThe game unfortunately ended up in a grind, with run-of-the-mill quests that rewarded you with a whole lot of dissatisfaction. I wanted to keep in touch with the game, by waiting for new content, but by that time, my friends were already bored, and subsequently abandoned the game.\n\n4/10. I'd recommend this game to those with a couple friends that want to fool around for a while, but is not a game you should invest a lot of time or money in.\nWarframe fits the same Free-To-Play, Sci-Fi niche, and offers a better arsenal of weapons and classes.\n","January 12","false","42.7"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","16","22","0","0"

The game then quickly gives you insight to each class and have you choose one to begin the campaign. Despite giving brief desciption, you do get a sense of lost on how truely worth wild some weapons/class are more than others. In most cases, I ended up using the AOE type gun because the mobs move around so fast and I'm spinning around looking for them because they might be going after your buddies or some stranger behind you then at the bottom of your feet, you got alien roaches poking you and you don't really know until they hit you because they are small and jump at random targets sometime. Being ammo based(you can replenish it with several ways), if you're not accurately skilled at aimming, you could be ending up wasting a lot of ammo. A lot of times when I shoot monsters, the whole feel of it doesn't feel right because I shoot, they stop, twitch then die and I'm standing there wondering wtf just happened.\n\nIn one quest I had to go blow up some reactors or something in some enemy base? Base is empty, I freely walked through, then random enemies spawned that I quickly took out. SO BORING. Killing Hogger was more fun.\n\nCustomizing your character is a bit lack luster, I wasn't impressed at the choices they offered. Their guns, although look different when compared to the next, didn't give that same feel like when you play other games like WoW. Getting stuff like a Thunderfury even though its subpar when compared to higher tier items like warglaives, is still a great vanity and awesome weapon to have around. Firefall, to me, all weapons look and feel the same to an extent or using the same template thats altered for unique-ness sake.\n\nDidn't understand upgrading much either and I got lost pretty easily. Because its so open world, you can get lost pretty fast when you're new or just traveling is a chore unless you use the glider. I found myself bumping into things way more than I would like. With other MMO, despite being less opened, players aren't likely to get lost or get caught somewhere like between two rocks under a hut and is not quite stuck yet not loose enough to get free. With enough patience, you could find fast routes.\n\nThe quest though important for certain game mechanics, seems pointless and falls off the cliff of being side tracked. Placed me in an important military group only to make me run dumb errands like finding someone's husband? Hello?! I'm a elite warrior thats going to save humanity! Ain't nobody got time for this sheez! I didn't bother reading nor care what I was getting. I didn't understand the point at all.\n\nI felt very lost, out of placed and out of context when it comes to syngery or immersion in this huge epic story to save humanity. Didn't make me want to play more to unlock stuff. For a FPS type MMOG, I don't know how well it'll do. If any of you played Tabula Rasa, I felt more immersed into that game than this one and you had to walk everywhere... EVERYWHERE! Too bad it had some short comings it didn't fix in time.\n\nHopefully Firefall gets back on track. There's some pretty embarasing and funny bugs and glitches that im surprised they didn't fix. As of now, I'm lost, bored, not caring much about the main/side story. Looking at the battleframes and such, I don't think my time will be of any worth investing either. It's a shame. Being how old WoW is, I still considered it one of the top tier games atm and they executed it very well. Only reason it's not as popular now is because people want something fresh. Some might contest because they like their "FREE MMO". Nothing tops SWG, pre Combat Patch.

All in all, if you like running, jumping, jetting, flying, riding bikes and shooting stuff, and getting rewarded for it, (like 'Pandora', but it's actually Future Earth) this one is well worth a look. Free to try. Free to play. Sure, there's a cash shop, and the swag is pretty sweet, but you don't have to buy a thing. f'reelz.","July 23, 2014","true","939.7"," 50 of 89 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","50","89","0","0"

I haven't played this game in a long while. But when I saw the Rocketeer DLC I got hyped about playing the game once more. So I installed the game again and bought several DLC Packs actually. I was really looking forward to playing my awesome Engineer once more.\n\nSo I start the game and watch that awesome trailer where this group of ARES Pilots gets attacked by Araneas, amongst other things, while defending their Thumper. The trailer brings back sweet memories of all the awesome combat I've had with my Engineer. The Engineer quickly changes weapons on her wrist-mounted device and kicks ♥♥♥ etc. It's sooo awesome.\n\nSo then I eventually get into the game only to find it almost completely redone!! (in my eyes atleast...)\n- The story is remade as far as I can tell...\n\n- The equipment/gear is completely changed. The armor looks reaaaally clunky and unbalanced...\n\n- But the most noticable change? I no longer have a wrist-mounted secondary gun.... I hold it in my fri**** hands... why?\nThe wrist-mounted version was soo awesome.... why change that? That's what made the Engineer stand out from the other classes...\n\n- And the visual design on the Engineer/Bastion isn't even the same as the trailer anymore... that made me reaaaally pi****!... I mean how can you have the original trailer and not have the original visuals on the fri**** Engineer?!\n\nNot happy, not happy at all....

I was looking for a fun RPG to play, and came across it browsing Steam.  I have enjoyed this game immensely, getting to know the crafting, jobs, instances, and world events.\n\nFirefall has a lot of different stuff to do, though as many other reviews bring up, sometimes it can get a bit grindy(what with 16 or so frames to level).  That being said, there's a decent community on Firefall, and it's a lot of fun to run with other people in a squad, really letting you see the different classes work together.  The Types(classes) all feel different, and the Advanced Frames have some pretty fun changes, such as the Mammoth's ability to teleport, or the Raptor's Powerfield.\n\nIt's not perfect, sometimes the job boards can take a while to load objectives, and sometimes the UI doesn't work.  While it might not be the best to say at least they have a quickfix(/rui) that usually corrects it... but hey, at least there's that.  The devs are still active, working on game systems and fixing issues as they can.  In fact, I even have gotten the chance to go on a run with a dev, which was super neato.\n\nAll in all, I've really enjoyed this game's feel, from the combat which can often be intense and fast-paced, the myriad of events going on, and the variety of ways to play with the different Types and Frames.  Oh, and it's all voice acted, from all the job boards to the Campaign instances.\n\nLooking for something fun and free, give Firefall a try :)","March 20, 2015","true","559.5"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vallinek/recommended/227700/","vallinek","Vallinek","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vallinek/","82 products in account","To be honest, the things that made me try this game out were the fact that some of my friends recommended it to me and that Yahtzee said that "combat was fun". Otherwise I wouldn't even notice it.\n\nFirefall is a futuristic MMO/shooter hybrid. After some meteorite hit Earth and everything went to hell, the humanity managed to survive, the player is some kind of mercenary, and whatnot, typical MMO stuff, or so it seems at first. The plot is actually quite good, at least when it comes to missions you take from job boards, which create certain story arcs, some of them even interesting. The voice acting is surprisingly very well-done, and it's a pleasure to listen to dialogues and whatnot. And then we get to gameplay...\n\nAt the very beginning, we are given five battleframes, or classes of sorts: Dreadnaught who's slow but has tons of health, can put up shields and uses a huge minigun, Assault with a launcher that deals splash damage, high speed and mediocre defenses, Engineer who puts up sentry guns and disp-er, I mean supply stations, Biotech who heals and uses a needle gun, and Recon who's the fastest but also the weakest class, sporting a machine gun with a scope and huge range (TF2 counterparts would be Heavy, Soldier/Demoman, Enginner [duh], Medic and Scout/Sniper). Granted, those classes have "upgrades" or rather different battleframes that work similarly but use slightly different weapons and abilities, but those have to be unlocked by maxing out battleframe levels (they max out at 40). Fortunately, unlike other games where you pick a class and stick to it for the rest of the game, you can switch battleframes at every battleframe station. They level up separately, though.\n\nNow, let's get to the combat. You can freely switch between TPS and FPS modes (the former being easier to see what's going on around you, the latter being easier to aim). Enemies usually try to swarm you or run around and shoot you, and there are also special variations of enemies - bigger, stronger ones, exploding suicide bombers, freeze ones that slow you down if they are killed in your vicinity... this makes for a huge variety of different opponents you'll face. You can also use jet boots and jet packs mounted onto your battleframe to take off into the air and shoot enemies from there. The combat is fast-paced and full of action, and makes for a pretty fun experience.\n\nYou can grind out your levels (as is usually the case in MMOs), but what I really like is the fact that there's tons of quests that can be repeated. Also, killing enemies doesn't really give that much experience points, the bulk of it will come from completed quests. This is a good thing, as grinding while doing quests feels much better than just grinding. It gives you a sense of purpose other than seeing virtual numbers increment.\n\nWhat is really good, though, is the fact that you will see some events going on around the area - some broken equipment ready to be repaired, other players trying to mine resources and defending the mining machine from monsters etc. Nothing stops you from joining in and helping out, and it lies in your best interest, as you will gain experience or resources of your own. That was a very pleasant surprise, as it's rare to see a MMO that actively encourages co-op.\n\nHowever, this game doesn't come without its downsides. The combat and gameplay might be fun, but in the end, it still comes to just grinding stuff out. At least it's a pleasure to grind out stuff, most of the time. Also, this game tends to be glitchy at points, and not all of those glitches are of the "fun" variety. I gotta admit, this game is still better programmed than some other ones I've seen before...\n\nOverall, this is a good MMO and game overall (which is saying something, considering I usually loathe grindfests). Obviously, the game is most fun when played together, but solo play is good, too, especially that you'll frequently come across other players with whom you will cooperate to achieve common goals.","August 23, 2014","true","145.3"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","1"

I love this game and cannot believe this has happened.\nThe game is technically "free to play" but because of recent changes I cannot recommend it for anyone. Because of shifts in management and terrible desicions on implimentation of game mechanics, Firefall has changed wildly from what it used to be.\nMassive server wipes have claimed maps, items, abilities, and characters.\nAudio files over most of the game have been corrupted or completely wiped, this means sound effects are either gone or rarely work. Npcs were previously professionally voice acted, that is all gone now, and the few times things are voiced now it is done badly.\nServer lag is now rampant, along with huge numbers of glitches, and disconecting.\nCrafting was removed and the market as a result has been almost wiped out.\nItems, abilities, and frames players had were removed without compensation.\n\nUpdate: All the stuff above is still a large problem but some fixes have been introduced, the most noticable being the character models don't look like rag dolls anymore.\n\nI am still going to error on not recommending this for the time being because not enough has been fixed.","January 26","false","85.8"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","11","16","2","1"

Rather than address these, the devs completely revamped the game in other ways and basically dumbed the whole thing down.  They claim the recent "improvements" were down to community feedback, yet I am unable to find many members of the community who agree.\nThink Star Wars Galaxies if you recall that game. It was an awesome in-depth game that required at least a bit of intelligence and commitment to achieve anything, then came the "new game enhancements" which dumbed the whole game down so that even a 5 year old console player wouldnt be put off.

Its not a deep game with lots of intricate game play and deep stats. What it is though is a heck of a lot of fun to play. Jump in and go guns blazing. You can play for hours jumping from thing to thing but its also very easy to get in and play for little snippets since most events are only 5-10 minutes long. And Jet Packs. . . who doesn't love Jet Packs?! I keep waiting to get tired of them and just don't. I think many will disagree with me but I also find the game to be very well optimized. I can be on screen with about 20-30 other players and at 30-50 mobs with all sorts of abilites and effects going off and have very little FPS drop. The game is able to dynamically downgrade your quality to keep FPS up which is a nice feature. It could be that it is not that well optimized and its this feature kicking in that does the trick, but honestly, I'm not focused on textures when I am hopping around like mad trying to blast baddies.\n\nIts also a pretty good F2P model. You can reasonably get everything you want in game given enough time, and the time spent isn't even that egregious. The main things people will want in the store are new frames and transportation. The frames can be obtained by leveing one of the free frames which gives you the ability to unlock a new one for free and so on. The transportation is really something you need to spend money on. You can get a free LGV (motor cycle) at level 25 but thats a pretty long way in and single use gliders will just get frustrating. The company has to make money somewhere so I think this is a good trade off. The other thing to buy is cosmetic stuff but that in no way is required and is just fluff.","September 11, 2014","true","190.6"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","0"

Almost as long as it's been losing players, in fact. Slowly, but steadily, the game shifted from amazing me with its quality, to instead amazing me with just how terrible the devs could prove themselves to be. It's kind of like most shows on TV these days, with the only exception being that you don't come in with the expectation of it being terrible from the get-go.\n\nWith the most recent update, the game finally stopped clinging onto mixed-quality limbo and dropped into the flaming pit of no return, screaming in agony with Electronic Arts, Activision, Ubisoft, Aeria Games, Nexon, and Perfect World Entertainment. Purchased by a Chinese company, Firefall was pressured into pushing out an update that wasn't even ready, and my goodness was it ever not ready. "The update that killed Firefall" as the community calls it, has essentially taken what little good there was left in the game and thrown it out the window. Or rather, that's what I would say, except they actually did that quite some time ago, so really what's going on here is they dragged the game back in, decided it wasn't dead enough, so they then drove a knife through its heart and threw it from the roof instead of the window, then finally ran out there with a hammer and hit it once, just to be sure. In one single update, this has gone from a good free to play title with a few flaws to "how not to run an F2P 101".\n\nNo quality remains. You can salvage more from the debris of a nuclear apocalypse than you can from this game. The only thing between this game and death is the server being shut down. If you are a new player debating whether or not to play this game, I STRONGLY recommend you decide against it, for all you will be doing is wasting your bandwidth, harddrive space, and time. There are many other F2P games out there, and at this point, almost all of them are better than this.\n\nEven if you much prefer tormenting yourself with repetitive gameplay, bad design choices, and bugs, you'd still be better served with the latest CoD title instead. Because this game is so bad now, that even if you were - for some reason - wanting to play a game that was bad, you'd still feel that this was too terrible for you.","February 3","false","4.8"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","12","18","3","0"

And we definitely had a lot of ups and downs in all this time.\nBut I think this (most likely) last iteration on it is by far one of the better, if not the best. Since the game is not released yet, I can only review the beta as it is right now and leave some thoughts on what is planned for launch.\n\nFirst of all in this MMO you do not have to choose a character, and a class for it that will forever stay with you. Not at all, your character has access to any Battleframe you wish. Well, 5 of them at the start. 11 of them if you purchase them with an ingame currency (called pilot tokens which you get by simply playing the game) or, if you really can't wait, Red Beans which is the real money currency. These Battleframes, the very well thought-out futuristic armors of Firefall, aren't set classes either.\nEvery Battleframe has access to a big variety of abilities and perks which you can find or unlock to build your favorite Frame around your favorite playstyle.\n\nSecond point, it is indeed an open world. Quite an impressive one too. Not only visually but it always has something to do in it.\nNow for your freedom of exploring, you might not be able to go anywhere and kill stuff right from the start, but every corner of New Eden, which is the place you will start the game in, has a quite a few things to be discovered while you level up your Battleframe. This does not mean however that you can not just walk anywhere you want! You're free to go to any place you like to your own risk. No portals or gates that will kick you out! But own risk because enemies will get stronger in different parts of the world. Which for the most part shouldn't be a problem however if you play with friends. And the veteran players are always there to help too.\n\nSpeaking of the community. So far, it has been one of the best gaming communities I have ever participated in.\nQuestions will get answered, you will always get revived or supported and everyone is being nice to each other.\nSure there are sometimes exceptions to every one of these points, but they're really rare in Firefall. At least in beta.\nOutside of the game there are plenty of fansites and guides from players too.\n\nWell, then there's of course the combat which I should talk about.\nI personally never play in first person. Which is why I will just say that I didn't find anything to complain about in the few minutes I played in that perspective. FoV goes up to 120 and everything's pretty fluid.\nFor third person I have to say that it feels just wonderful, which isn't a surprise considering Firefall had once plans to compete as an esports shooter. The character handles very well, and everything feels really responsive.\nNow for the combat itself against the environment. There are a whole lot of enemies with different different abilities and characteristics. Aranhas in example, the spider-like creatures come in many different sizes and ways to kill you. Little, fast sprinters that try to bite off a piece of you, or bigger acid-spewing bugs.  Some even try to explode right in your face!\nThen there are of course the main enemies of the game. The Chosen. Even those aren't just the same cloned trooper. Some carry sniper rifle-like weaponry, others whole cannons. Some try to get you close to them, others will take you out from further away.\n\nThe story so far is pretty interesting too. It is not only told by campaign missions or little jobs though, throughout New Eden you will find recordings which contain a lot of lore too. It's a good balance between getting the story told to you directly and to find out yourself by exploring the world.\n\nTo finish a review that got a lot longer than I expected, let's talk about the favorite topic when it comes to free to play.\nIs it pay to win? No. Red5 said they will never sell any power to you. And so far they have never done so and don't seem to ever will. The only "advantage" you can get over other players is shorter crafting times or currency boosts in example. Just optional convenience items and cosmetics.\nAre you forced to pay to get anything out of the game without grinding for years? Well here's a point where it's pretty much opinion versus opinion. You see, it is an MMO. The grind will always be there to some degree. But trust me, it is and will become way less of a grind and more of an adventure to you to level up. Not only that, but you can always do whatever you feel like, of course, at your own risk as stated before. But after a day of playing you should be very much good to go to do quite a lot of things already. Or let me make it shorter. You will never be forced to do little things until you level up a lot.\n\nNow, maybe I should add some cons though, as this game definitely isn't perfect as much as I wish it was.\nThe weapon variety isn't very big YET. Until they'll implement new ones, you're stuck with one primary weapon choice on Accord Battleframes and two options on advanced Battleframes. Also, five secondaries. This might be a huge turn-off for you.\nI don't know yet if and what they will do about it, but sometimes the shards don't seem to be enough to handle the playercount. By that I mean that at least in beta you sometimes rarely saw some content like Chosen taking over parts of the map as there were too many players to even give them a chance. I'm sure they'll do something about it and I hope they have something ready on launch.\nThere probably will still be bugs. You see, I would like to think that Red5 came out with a magic patch that fixes every bug that is currently in beta, but I doubt it will happen. They will definitely fix them, but at launch there might still be things like soundbugs.\n\nAnyways, I think that's it from me. To answer the question that lead you to this review yes, I would definitely recommend this game. Without a single doubt you should at least try it if anything you saw so far seems interesting to you!","July 8, 2014","true","854.1"," 44 of 79 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","44","79","0","0"

I have always enjoyed basically any blend of First-Person Shooter and Role Playing game, so I approach this with a heavy bias.\n\nThe main story is actually pretty engaging in a big space opera, future of the entire species kind of way. The side-quests are... on the whole, less like that, but some of them still manage to deliver in terms of ineresting and attention grabbing story. Some (but not all) of the voice acting is so bad that it's funny. Similarly to the queastionable writing, this mostly affects side-missions, but since these can be a very quick way to level, it's not like this stuff is stashed out of the way where the player might never hear it. In spite of being a hammed up cliche(at times), the story is consistent within the game world, and at no point do I find myself wondering why I'm doing anything.\n\nThe open world PVP is excellent, but sadly the OWPVP zone tends to be a bit of a ghost town. Every time I've been there I've spent long amounts of time wondering where everyone was only to be quickly ganked and ambushed by the first person I see, who then disappears as suddenly as they appeared. I see potential here, but I can't really tell you what kind of potential since all of my experiences in PVP land have been strange and surreal.\n\nThe F2P is not P2W. You advance at a decent rate even if you insist on spending no money on the game. IRL currency can be used to buy basically anything that good old fashioned mining and grinding will get you, but it can also be used to purchase things that make the overall game experience much more convenient (vehicles and gliders, XP and money boosts) or lively (customizations and cosmetics) without giving paying players any sort of advantage over other players (no weapons or kit that only paying players get).\n\nIf FPS isn't your thing you can play it in third person.\n\nIt's space opera.\n\nThe jump jets are just like the ones in Tribes (old Tribes, not the new garbage the kids are playing now, though they're probably just liek the ones in there too, if the new tribes even has jumpjets... can you really do tribes without jumpjets? God I hope they didn't try to do that).\n\nDude yeah, it's actually just like Tribes and Borderlands had a little F2P MMO baby that bears a strange resemblance to Destiny, but doesn't have Bungie's weird pretentious stench all over it (and it's actually a little less of a grind... yeah, a F2P game is less grindy than B2P Destiny... not sure which game that says more about).\n\nIf you read this far just download it already.","September 26, 2014","true","497.2"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","13","20","0","0"

I have been a Firefall player since the first days of closed beta. Anyone that tries it now wont believe that back then there was only missions, thumping (the resource gathering), and invasions/watchtower fights. They have furthered the experience one can have on Firefall through a Campaign that I give 9.5 out of 10.  The adding of leveled npcs and the leveling of battleframes will take some getting used to for me but hey, its still fun.  I highly recommend this to any serious PvE player. The NPCs get a 10/10 despite the glitches (which make it 10/10 because they are almost always hilarious). The developers of the game often play alongside the players and I have the honor of having two said developers on my friends list. Overall I give this game 9.7/10 for enjoyable campaign, fun PvE combat, seasonal events, the motorcycles (known to us Firefall gamers as LGVs), and the like. Also one more note: Have your friend(s) play with you for a more enjoyable experience. I am normally a "lone wolf" on some games, but on Firefall its a lot more fun and memorable with friends. I cant count how many times I stood shoulder to shoulder with fellow ARES pilots in a squad fighting the antagonist faction known as the Chosen. The game still has some issues however, but they are working more and more each and every day to fix them. Should you read this review and try it, I want to recommend you possibly look around as soon as your in for a teacher on the various functions of the game. The game isnt hard to learn, but many will have questions. Just type "/z Hey I am new" and people will welcome you with friendly greetings. If im ever on when you try it, I can lend a hand! Just type /addfriend Cyberwolf309 and then type /w Cyberwolf309 and tell me who you are and ill help~  One last thing is customization.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kuroyukihimeeee/recommended/227700/","Kuroyukihimeeee","Kuro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kuroyukihimeeee/","210 products in account","So this is my own personal review/feedback/whatever on Firefall as it stands right now at release. At the time of writing this, I have clocked 500 hours on the release version of Firefall, along with 62 days since it went. It’s based on my last few weeks playing, levelling lower frames from New Eden and beyond, taking on Titan bosses, campaign, etc, etc. Feel free to leave your thoughts or replies here, but like I said, this is my opinion on the game, yours may differ.\n\nReview was written 9th August 2014, Firefall build V1.0.1793.\n\nStory 6/10\n\nThe story and lore behind Firefall is really quite good. It’s not just your standard end of the world survival or fantasy game that 90% of the market seems to be flooded with. It’s a great change of pace, the campaign storyline, be it a little short is engaging and I find its biggest issue is the lack of real character development since virtually every character you talk to once or twice, and then never see, or hear of them again. There are a few exceptions to this, like Aero, your operator for example who you will be with your entire Firefall career and Hobbes from the campaign, The Meddler from ARES Jobs but nothing sticks out long enough, or gets enough explanation to make me care about them, their backstory, it just leaves me thinking what a missed opportunity to dive into the Firefall universe. Sure, we don’t need to know about that one random farmer you helped retrieve a bracelet or something, but when it’s a character, really out of the ordinary, like the Meddler for instance, it really would be good to see their backstory.\n\nAs you progress in Firefall, the story changes considerably. You start out as a brand new player in town, so you get the low work, collect this, collect that, etc. Once you start to gain the trust of the Accord and fractions though, you are allowed to move on to higher level work, like sensitive data recovery, target elimination. The story really does do an excellent job of keeping you interested in the world, since unlike most characters, Firefall gives you loads of lore, backstory, etc about the world you are living and fighting in. Moving thought the zones, the story is consistent, and gradually builds up from simple tasks to moving on to fight the Chosen in an all-out war with strikes, kidnappings, ambushes, etc.\n\nI am really looking forward to chapter two and beyond for the campaign arcs, if the first one is anything to go by, Firefalls story is only just getting started. Based on what I have seen, I personally rate the story a 6/10. Whilst it is very fun and engaging, the missed opportunity of lack of character development and very short nature of the Campaign overall is a huge downside, once the next chapters come out, I would very much hope I can improve this rating.\n\nGraphics 8/10\n\nOne of Firefalls strongest points is its beautiful world. Coral Forest has vast open beaches to rocky cliff faces, to lush forest. Sertao is a rocky desert with dust storms, mountains and small areas of forest more inland. Devils Tusk is on an island covered with lava from erupting volcanos. These are just the zones that players will travel through and they really give the game a sense of vastness and beauty. Playing on Ultra, this game is out of this world.\nFirefall has this very unique art style, I can’t quite place my finger on it but it’s like a mix of Manga and Borderlands and to be frank, it’s something that works really well. This game is not designed to be hyper realistic like say Crysis is, but not completely out of the ordinary, like Borderlands goes for.\n\nMy only problem is in some places, textures really are stretched out, ruining and scene. There also are quite a few spots where a texture goes into another, and you can clearly see how one is higher resolution compared to the other. Now this could be down to the way Firefall streams in textures as it needs them, as a player with a slow internet connection, I cannot give the game huge bandwidth to download textures, and there is no way to just download them from a launcher or via Steam.\n\nI personally rate the graphics of Firefall to be an 8/10, the only reason I drop marks for it is because in those patches where graphics suck, it just ruins the experience for me. I would like to think in the future, we can see more detailed models, textures, etc being rolled out and any areas where it is a little off can be patched.\n\n\nSound 7/10\n\nFirefalls sound when just shooting, running around, etc is average at best. Pretty much every gun of the same variation sounds the same, no matter how good or bad it is, and most sound assets which you hear early on, you will likely hear again, and again, and again.\n\nWhat really saves the audio for Firefall is its voice acting and its background music. The voice acting for some is really hit and miss, some characters sound really out of place, but overall they do a great job of sucking you into the world, and it’s really nice to see that a AAA MMO went for full voice acted missions, on every job, campaign mission, NPC, etc. For some, this isn’t a huge issue, but for me I really like to have the story read out and brought to life, this is what Firefall does very well.\n\nThe background music in Firefall, or its entire OST for that matter is nothing short of amazing. My favourite piece is from the first campaign mission, Crash Down. Sometimes I will want to go and play that mission just to hear that music again and again! I find that even 500 hours in, I love having background music at full volume still, something on many other games I find myself muting due to its repetitive nature or just average music.\n\nI rate the sound of Firefall a 7/10. Whilst many assets are used far too often, the voice acting and the background music and OST I would rate as a 10/10 on their own. Props to the composers and musicians involved in Firefall!

For me these are the big ones, no fun trying to aim at every target, might as well play COD or some other first person shooter...think the devs lost a lot of focus on what they had.\n\nThey have also, well looks like... down graded(changed) the graphics in expotions and bullets shooting quality of what looked good, to some form of what is almost comical.\n\nLost abilityz / equipment that owned.  By the sounds of things items purchased from real money for to own, are now only reanted( not sure on that as haven't played enough to see what will happen and wont be playing much at all).\n\nDevs had a great thing going and was kind of looking forward to new things but they should have made a new game rather than make this one crappy.  maybe in 2020 when the next change happens thay can make it more like the old and I will play again.  why do these game makes take steps bacwards and ignore feedback for a quick buck return is any body guess.   well I guess this leave me with more me time and to find a better game that the garbage they have now created.\n\nNow in saying all that you may love this new version, might be great to play if you never played the old one, there is still some great aspect to the game like jet packs and walking about shooting stuff, but its not even a shaddow of what it could have been in the derection they took...sry devs a big thumbs down from me.\n","February 27","false","889.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

Each patch broke more than it added and everything seems half ♥♥♥♥♥ from quest item drops (from killing mobs) not showing up in caves but rather on top of the mountains above to the long awaited return of Devils Tusk (which has been in game for a couple years but they "re did it") which turned out to be a complete mess.  No atmosphere, you walk up to a lava pit and no sounds... No events, all the quests were broke (took 20 mins for the quest giver to give you the quest and another 20 for the quest to show up on the map).  The new world event they talked up for a month before the release was broken for weeks.  All the end game raids wouldn't allow full raid groups to enter.  Not a peep from R5 about this for over a week.  It was like they just said F it there's nothing we can say at this point.\n\n1.6 came out earlier this year and the player base took a nose dive because everything was broken.  There's currently like 300 people on durring the day (that's probably generous) and maybe 600 at night although that probably has dropped since I quit playing a week ago.\n\nIt's a shame this game had potential in Beta and it just never progressed correctly.  I have never been more dissapointed in a developer as R5.  They are the absolute worse bunch of clowns.  They NEVER test anything before releasing it for years they relied on players to do the testing. And, even when people went through the trouble of testing and writing bug reports they NEVER listened to them and just released the patch with all the bugs.\n\nThey just lost the crafting designer which was supposed to be their next patch (to add that back into the game) and now I've heard that they scrapped it to start over because they don't have competant people there to take over what he left them.  I mean the incompetance just keeps evolving faster than the game.  Go read their glassdoor comments from past employees it will explain how terrible that company has become since the9 took over (A Chinese company) that funded them after the ♥♥♥♥♥ that ran the company wasted all their cash on a multimillion dollar bus that doesn't work and started a video production company that only did some crap parody music videos in someones back yard...  You cannot write this stuff the drama is something to really take in!\n\nIf you want to be depressed thinking about what this game could have been feel free to level from scratch... You will see the possabilities but probably by the time you reach max level the game will no longer exist.","May 23","false","838.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Saw it got fully released, didn't initially want to play it. My friends started playing it. I got bored. Downloaded Firefall after a week with hopes of playing games with them. The only thing we ever did was add each other as friends.\n\nDidn't wait for me to catch up in level. Didn't switch to a new battleframe (can do it at will for free) until I was the same level as their main battleframe. Nothing.\n\nThe game is terrible and lackluster and a massive walking simulator for "the first 20 levels" as it was put to me by multiple people, friends and otherwise. They claim it revolves around "dynamic events." I barely encountered any at all. The Thumper minigame you can do is the only way you can have anything resembling a "dynamic event." Even that is terrible. No one joins in. Nothing. The only time I ever saw other players was in the main city.\n\nThe game's idea of objectives (if you're doing missions from the job board) being "near" each other is have one objective 1km away in one direction, and then 2km in the opposite if there are multiple objectives.\n\nThe art style is appealing only to those with a sense of style comparable to a 12 year old's.\n\nOverall, I cannot recommend this game. Not a single bit. How people find it to be enjoyable is completely beyond me.\n\nOn a positive note, the soundtrack is good.","August 8, 2014","false","8.8"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BudleysGaming/recommended/227700/","BudleysGaming","Budley","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BudleysGaming/","23 products in account","While this is a review in itself, it may contain spoilers/\n\nIntroduction:\nI have been a Firefall player since back in Closed Beta. The game was never good enough to live up to expectations, of course, this was just in the beta. But, since v1.0 came out for launch, playing in the early access proved that the game has come a long way. Throughout the beta, a lot has been changed, a lot added to the game, and a lot removed, and some even added, made the game worse and then removed(Professions and leveling, gg), but the game took a turn for the best and proves a whole new experience to retain the original story of Firefall.\n\nFree to Play?:\nThis has been an ongoing conflict. Red 5 claims that Firefall is free to play, and while others may disagree, I agree with Red 5, that this is a truly Free to Play game. A player will never have to spend money to advance/progress/win/play and fully experience. Where there may be some exclusive items(cosmetics, boost, vip, transport) that can only be obtained with the purchase of/with red beans, you won't need these items to fully enjoy the game as most of these items same items can be obtained in game through actually playing the game. Some items that howevever can only be obtained through red beans. Red 5's recent Red Bean exchange fixes that. This is where a person can use in game currency(credits<obtained by trading in crystite) to buy red beans from other players, or sell those players their red beans for credits. In my opinion, this new addition makes firefall a truly Free to play game.\n\nNew Player Experience?:\nBeing in the closed beta for so long got me so accustomed to the UI and the generalfeel of the game. With some parts being far too frustrating and complicated than it needed to be, how it is now, it's far better. While I agree that the research tree could use some more work, UI-wise(actually more complicated than it was before), everything else seems to fit in perfectly in Red 5's(the studio) attempt to make the game easier to understand.\n\nNew Content:\nFrom the beta, the game has gotta a lot new content(with more to come I hope). From finally adding the much loved Sertao(the area we saw in early days with dredge), to *TITANS*, yeah i said it, Titans, there's a lot of content to keep someone busy. The open world PvP is to die for, while i haven't been able enjoye it much as times when I go to Broken peninsula(the place where open world pvp is), there is hardly anyone there. The "Zone Information" Addon would state that theres only 5 people in this BP Shard when i'm there and after exploring, I still would not find anyone. Ares jobs have been a great addition to firefall, in a smaller way to explain a much larger story(Ares 35?). Nevertheless, Ares Jobs needs a lot of work and tweaking. Well obviously, its been brought to the attention of Red5 the problems with escort missions, such as NPC's getting stuck and having way too little health to get through the mission. Another thing that could be different is the way these missions play out(PCGamer's first launch review also highlights this). I find myself getting an objective to go to, lets say from Copa to Thump Dump, to meet someone there, and upon meeting that person, telling me to go back all the way to Copa. Even though I have an Omnidyne LGV to make it easy for me, it wont be that much satisfying to newer players. The implementation of Titans in this game have been long coming and is very satisfying, however, in the Campaign Mission 8 to return to BWA, the Necronus(1 type of titan/spider like thingy) is very boring. While I understand the boss needs to be extremely tough, especially one as large as him, the fight is not very interactive. When my friends and I do BWA(NOT, NOT, NOT in hardcore mode) playing lvl 40 frames with purple gear, we would be forced to go to certain Titan "Blind Spots" to kill it, and just sit there and shoot, only to move and take cover when the Titan does his "missile" attack or that insanely awesome 1-shot laser. While I am eager to experience the Kanaloa(Giant lava worm) in one of Devil's Tusk's 20-man raid, and hope it's very interactive and fun(which the trailer that Red 5 released for it makes it out to be), BWA's Necronus could maybe do with some more tweaking to make it more fun.\n\nWhat shouldn't have been changed:\nA lot of stuff were changed that should never have been, for one, INVASIONS, where are those lag fest invasions we loved so much? Strike teams are way too easy, watchtowers are hardly if not ever attacked :(. Also, I personally am not fond of level restrictions in the open world area, I would like to be able to be powerful wherever I go. Additionally, I dont see how the mammoth is working out as being the mammoth, with the new battleframe cores, for some weird reason, both my bastion and my mammoth have almost the same lvl 40 health cores in them, yet my mammoth has like 27k HP and my bastion has 30k HP, I dont think the health cores should make a tanky class, made to tank ♥♥♥♥, differ so shortly from a support class. Just my opinion though. Dynamic events seem to not be soo dynamic anymore btw, just saying.\n\nWhat has changed that needed to be changed:\nProfessions, R.I.P and you will not be missed except from those who were grandfathered, GTFO PROFESSIONS. The new resource system, although I wouldn't have though that this would have needed to change, but after changing it, it's much better. I'm glad they got rid of constraints(weird progression), it mad putting all purple tier IV stuff on a frame almost impossible, but they reverted constraints' progression back to the good old levelling. *Sniffles* I miss Soaring Afterburner :( :( :( :( :(\n\nDo I recommend Firefall?:\nIndeed I do recommend Firefall, in it's core idea, Firefall is a fun game to play. It's general playstyle and UI is great. It's compatibility isn't all that great since others have reported experience "fps" issues on a high end gaming pc, but, it's still barely manageable. The game itself can keep players active with stuff to do, till they level at least two battleframes to level 40, then they may run out of new content. Hopefully Red 5 would release the other two chapters of the campaign soon and make it longer(lets say 10 chapters? plox red 5 <3).\n\nIn conclusion, Firefall is a great game and has gotten better from how it was in it's beta stages and is definitely worth playing, if not, at least trying, cause it is Free to Play.","July 29, 2014","true","045.1"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

The game world is large, beautiful, open and very alive compared to other MMO's. I love the exploration in this game, the combat, the mechanics, and the community is top notch. Red5 has done a really good job shaping their game based on player feedback from both closed beta and open beta testers.\n\nI would recommend this game in a heart beat. ;D","July 8, 2014","true","946.9"," 20 of 34 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","20","34","0","0"

We have several new ways to hone our abilities, and grow stronger, to improve on our skill as a whole, while not overshadowing other players completely in the process.  Firefall is now a game about building yourself up for a fight that you can eventually win, and that's the fun of it.  The journey is there, and it is long.  It's fun.  It's exciting to share it with others.  And overall, I feel everyone who enjoys a shooter with MMO mechanics will love this game.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful for their style, offering a unique look from the drab "Realistic" we see every day.  The game performs well, with constant optimizations that have made the game play well even under hectic firefights.  The gameplay is solid, with missions being straightforward, and although at times shooter mechanics can be repetitive, the combat stays fresh because you can easily switch to other classes on the fly, rather than having to deal with multiple characters or accounts.\n\nThis is the MMORPGShooter that the world deserves.

I played since closed beta, was a founder, and spent a ridiculous amount of time on this game pre-steam. Every time I go to check back in on it and possibly come back, I hear about yet another wipe. Yet another core system change. I  played thorugh probably 3 tree wipes, weapon system redesigns, etc. They kept changing their mind on things right after people got fully used to the new system. It's absoutely unreal and if you want a good stable game that you can eventually learn everything in and not have to worry, this isn't it. Odds are they will rework an entire system every few months like it seems they've continued to do. And then you have to re-learn and re-grind.\n\nThis game was so golden when it first released and in beta.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fenum/recommended/227700/","fenum","Fenum","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fenum/","274 products in account","Really cool and fun game. And while it might seem like it's pay 2 win at first glance it's actually not since you have currency exchange to buy all the premium currencies with basic one (well you upgrade crystalyte to credits and credits to red beans) ofcourse there's a daily limit to how many you can convert but still. Alos majoroty of the "premium" stuff can also be sold on exchange for credits.(I guess I could say it's pay to obtain stuff faster).\nAnyway overall the game feels like mix between Borderlands (graphics, questing and open world wise) and warframe considering you have multiple battleframes and only one character. I haven't tried PvP aspect yet personally but people claim it's fun so I'll take that for granted atm.\n\nAs for battle frames at the moment start with 5 basic frames and there's 11 more advanced frames so there's 16 in total at the moment. Now to get advanced frames you have 3 options:\n1(captain obvious): Buy them for red beans,\n2 buy them for credits from exchange\n3 level up any frame to lv40 to get 10 tech points with which you can buy the for.\n\nNow while the game is extremely fun it doesn't come without flaws. For instance jobs get repetitive and boring as hell and since the objectives get placed randomly it sometimes places them on weird places like on top of the mountains. It also seems like the game requires a bit of skill to progress since ranged enemies hurt like hell and mobility is key to not getting shot so use your jetpack all the time and don't stand still.\nAnother flaw I noticed is lack of "extensive" tutorial so it might get confusing for new players there is tutorial for basics but it doesn't involve the crafting system which and how to obtain materials (besides thumping).\nAlso 1-use items are quite annoying especially the glider pads since I tend to use them every cooldown cuz they're fun. They are reusable(permanent) ones but they're a bit expensive.\nThumping to gather resources while fun at first it gets tedious when you have to wait for 5min to get that x amount of metals and dirt.\n\nNow let's go back to the fun parts.\n1. Quite emersive selection of frames which involves different playsyles also you can combine skills from basic with advanced frames of same type.\n2. OMG jetpack. fun to use especially if you're like me and use it constantly to climb mountains and then...\n3. ...use glider pads to glide around like a baws.\n4. nice graphics really nicely done world and different settings from beaches, mountains, forests and deserts.\n5. Random events that happen across the map and some give quite a bit of experience (especially tornadoes)\n\nSoo overall I'd give the game about 8/10 grade since it's not perfect there are some issues and it's not next-gen either but overall the fun I had in the game for past couple of days beats all the flaws. It's especialyl fun when you play it with friends and just mess around.","August 14, 2014","true","158.3"," 14 of 23 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","14","23","0","0"

Nothing has changed. Performance is a joke for a game that looks like a PS2 game, controls are decent, combat is fine if not basic, controls are good tbh, story is a throw away, environemts are littered with adverts for in game item that cost real money. Now back onto performance, for a game that looks this bad graphically it should run a million times better than it does with everything maxed out 1080p Ultra settings I get lowest of 38fps in starting town, and highest of 190fps... that is a massive jump. Even using vsync does not help as the game still has random loading sectons where you can tell its buffering the next area and the fps goes nuts. I have the lastest drivers and updates for my system and my system is no sloutch with an i7 4770K @ 4.5GHz and a 3GB HD7970 1150/1650 and 16GB 1866MHz RAM. I can max out Crysis 3, Metro LL, even ESO and still get smooth playable frame rates in those games that look ten times better than this game.\n\nOverall, download it and try for your self, it is free afterall but I bet you will uninstall it after an hour.\n\nPS/ I sunk 16 hours into the BETA 2 years ago and I sunk 1.5 hours into this release on steam....

I can only pick a few games which developers have been so forth coming, talkative and able to listen to a community like ours (during beta). I could only name another few games that i've been involved in where we were so close to the developers, and they made it a point to roll with the community in terms of feedback and gave their interpretation to that feedback in a subsequent update.\n\nSo you know about firefall right ? You can simply visit the store page for more information, but from what I've seen I can make a few  good points of this game.\n\nProgressing:\nYou have about 16 battleframes to choose from. You can choose only a few if you're picky about your game style (as a support or, healer, sniper or tank), or you can choose to level up many of these frames and join in on the massive world in battles with the game style which you think is right for the specific battle at hand.\n\nCustomizing,\nYou can customize how you look ingame, (in the 24th century you can even change your sex, allong with the rest of the usual suspects, body/hair color, battleframe color, some logo's etc....\n\nCrafting,\nIt's completely OPTIONAL!. You'll be able to just play because firefall is foremost a shooter first!. You'll earn new rewards as you just shoot away and do quests/missions. But if you want to specialize in certain craftmanships you can do it and make your awesome weapon, to use for yourself or to sell on the market!\n\nMarket\nFirefall has a market where - if you don't want to craft, or if you want to earn some money - you can rely on to get supplied.\n\nDynamic content:\nYou can literally wander in this vast world and do ares jobs/missions, then as you are doing your duties for the Accord, you stumble upon other dynamic adventures that you'll have to solve such as crashed objects that arrouse wildlife around it, coy transportation raiders, people being trapped, criminals on the run for the Accord and much much more.\n\nGlobal events, invasions\nAnd if that's not enough, there are organized massive events in this game which take place from time to time and invite everyone to contribute to the global war against te... umm I mean the chosen!.\n\nIn Firefall, you participate at your own level, sometimes in a squad, sometimes solo, sometimes in a hefty fight against a boss that will make your neck stiff. These titans will be for the hardest of the hardest (or so Nostromo says.. well at least I think he says that)\n\nYou can travel the world on foot inbetween missions, or benefit from gliders and vehicles to soar high above the sky when you go on your adventure.

I say so far because I can see me putting in a whole lot more. Now I can see why people wouldn't like this game. Yes it has bugs (other than the ones you kill). Yes sometimes mission objectives don't load & you have to restart the mission again. Some times enemies just vanish while your shooting them. But having played a lot of this over the last 2 weeks I can say that there is a lot more to this game which will outway the glitches & bugs.\n\nSo how is this different to any other MMO? Well apart from being a FPS or 3rd person shooter not much really. It has the same go kill this for this reward quest system. It has instances. It has raids. You find better gear to increase your character to be better for end game content. You can farm missions for resources and currency. You grind to get certain items. So pretty much the same story as any MMO.\n\nWell yes. But there are a few things that make this game stand out from the others. The dynamic world events are always ongoing. You will not be left standing around very often with nothing to do. From killing death teams to fighting for control of a thumper (machine used to extract resources from the ground). There is always something going on. I know other games such as Guild Wars 2 offer world events but not on the same scale as Firefall.\n\nThe fighting in this game feels great. Feels like a really good FPS or 3PS. It feels like it should. I personally play in First Person and really enjoy jumping around dodging snipers and plasma cannons trying to shoot me down as I fire thermal rounds burning everything in sight. Its a lot of fun.\n\nThats this games biggest asset. FUN. Yes it can be played seriously in a group in a raid situation. And yes if you roll in to a group instances under geared your probably going to be getting some abuse from the other players. But if you gear up properly you and your friends can have a lot of fun blasting away the enemy using plasma cannons, thermal cannons, poison shots, grenades, bombs and more. It can get really hetic.\n\nI would recommend this game to people who enjoy MMO's. This is not a pick up and play FPS. There is crafting and researching and levelled gear which you would normally find. So if your a MMO player give this a go. Yes its rough around the edges but its always being updated, theres tons to do and in a group its a hell of a lot of fun. It's also free to play (and can be played for completely free. Only real money is used for vanity items & VIP status which gives you a xp, money and reputation boost.)","February 10, 2015","true","262.4"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

One would think being open world would make it fun, it doesnt. There is just no real clear sense of direction. Your running back and forth in each level range hub taking and completing quests from a job board. Also lets not forget to mention you have to level each frame (class) from 1-40 separately. EACH frame. Even the premium frames and i believe theres a total of 16 different frames. Now i know most peoples response to this is "You have to level each class itself in other MMO's." Well yes, thats true, but most often the quest line is different for each class, or at least parts of the questlines are different.

However I have been playing this game since beta in about 2012. So when writing this review I want you to know that I have had some time with this game.\n\nFor those of you that don't know, Firefall is an MMORPG/FPS with optional 3rd person view. (Nice to have both honestly.) In terms of look and feel its kinda like Halo and Crackdown had a baby then sent it to WoW School. You may read that last sentence and say "but...I...how..." Just trust me on this. A lot of gameplay will feel familiar and natural. Much of the mechanics will seem very familiar as well if you have ever played an MMO like WoW.\n\nOne unique aspect is that each "class" is a wearable suit (called battleframe). Some are meant for getting up close and minigunning your enemies to pieces, others are more like snipers, picking off enemies from afar, still others are more utility like and meant for enhancing yourself or your team. Each frame levels up like a class would, but you don't have to roll another character to be a different "class". You simply change your frame. I like it because it means you don't have to roll alt characters and no need to worry about rebuilding rep or doing a bunch of pre reqs all over again. It's still your character that the people know and trust, you just changed your outfit. This may not apeal to people that are big into RP (something I do enjoy) but it's great when you don't have to grind everything all over again.\n\nSo what else about this game? Well, If you've made it this far, lets jump into the pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n- This game looks great! The art style is unique but awesome!\n- Combat takes skill, but isn't overcomplicated\n- Customization. While fairly limited, you don't usually feel like you look like everyone else.\n- There is always something to do! I mean this! Always something on your map that's relatively close. Usually it involves shooting things\n- It's not terribly grindy. Rarely was I sitting there going "please just ping already...."\n- Free to play. Yep you don't even have to buy the base game, you can just download and give it a whirl!\n- Gun play with badassery. Yes you shoot things a lot. But you also get abilities that make each frame feel and play differently\n- Player base. The community has been really fun and friendly. It helps that the game isn't designed to be able to cast blame, but people genuinely want to work together to accomplish bigger things.\n- Its genuinely fun. It's not deep thinking fun. But run around with friends saving the world fun.\n\nCons\n- It's small. They do a good job of making it feel big, and they have just added more content areas, but its sill kinda small.\n- Slightly glitchy. Overall, the game is really well polished, but occasionally there will be a glitch messes up your interface or send you trying to figure out a mission location for a half hour.\n- Free to Play. Yes, I said this as a pro, and its true.But you know why its bad. I will say it's definetly not pay to win, but that sweet paint job you want...$$$\n- Build timers. The crafting system is fairly in depth IMO, but its not instant unless you spend $$. Don't spend time building or researching at lower levels (you'll level too fast) and always try and keep something in the oven.\n- Limited starting frames. There are 5 base frames, all of which are viable, IMO. But you have to level up to get tokens in order to unlock more. Unless of course....$$$\n\nIn summary, this really is a good, fun game that I feel like is starting to find it's stride. It's fun enough that it keeps pulling me back and I have a blast. Yes you have to throw down cash for certain things, but its a "free" game. And if you enjoy it you should be spending some money to support the game, especially if you are getting novelty items to go along with it. (BTW, if you do decide to pay, I recommend buying a DLC pack because you usually get more bang for your buck.) Hope to see you in game!\n\nTL;DR\n\nIt's a fun game that looks great and feels well polished and definetly unique. Its F2P but its not Pay to win. Good times to be had!","August 1, 2015","true","110.3"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

The graphics play smoothly on any settings, yet on worst settings the game still looks... good, suprisingly, the paid for currency does not, I repeat DOES NOT, run this game, if you want the paid for currency, you can trade the normal currency in game to other players for it, most of the marketplace it completely run by the players, it is honestly a great game.

I'm really surprised at just how well this game turned out at launch.  I would highly recommend this game to anyone, and I'm generally pretty wary of free-to-play games.  The gameplay is solid, and being able to choose between first and third-person perspectives is a wonderful addition.  Each of these perspectives functions equally well, as opposed to some other games that don't handle the transition well at all.  Shooting, questing, resource gathering, crafting, customization, it's all here.\n\nThe graphics aren't too taxing to play on older systems, and they look nice and stylized, though it's apparent they were not going for a realistic style.  The art direction is very unique, and the world never feels "dead" or copy/pasted.  There are tons of nooks and crannies to explore, and even months later the starting zone is still interesting.  I've never experienced that in an MMO before.\n\nThe sound design is equally as well-thought-out as the gameplay, and I've found myself humming some of the tunes to myself on more than one occasion.  It's an interesting mix of instrumentation that I wouldn't expect to find in a game like this.  Whomever composed this soundtrack did a wonderful job.\n\nThere's a lot to enjoy here, and being free-to-play, there's nothing to lose if you're not playing every single day.  The sheer amount of content in Firefall is unexpected, and welcome!","July 29, 2014","true","99.2"," 113 of 215 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","113","215","0","0"

It also has much more exploration due to larger content increases.\n\nCons: The mechanics such as crafting are really simplified to the point where the only harvested minerals you recieve from crafting from lvl1-20 are basically raw earth, iron, tungston and crystite. There is a lot of traveling around which would disencourage lower leveled players; however there is a transit system.\n\nThis iteration of the game is really casual; however, it still makes unique differences to clasical MMORPGS mechanics such as combat and travel. It lacks in complexity, making it easier to learn, but leaves the player empty because progression is slow and learning stops at a certain level of play.\n\nI would still recommend this game solely for it's combat. ie: jet boots mixed with gunplay. It makes the grind somewhat bearable at least to level 40 for one frame.","July 30, 2014","true","48.3"," 73 of 138 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","73","138","0","0"

It's free to play; microtransactions are present, but for the most part you can get items off the Cash Shop (Red Bean Store) with currency earned in game. It's a first person/third person shooter with jumpjets. The game world is interesting if you are into the sci-fi genre. I started playing when it game finally released a month or two ago, and I'm still enjoying myself. I haven't spent a penny on the game, yet I've unlocked almost all the advanced frames within that time frame. Also, the gunplay isn't too bad, only annoying thing is sometimes the enemy's movements are a bit off/unpredictable/laggy, but that could be due to my horrid wireless connection.\n\nI'll end my gibbering with a pros vs cons list.\n\nPROS:\n+Interesting Sci-fi world with vast room to expand (both lore/story-wise and game content-wise)\n+Third/First person shooter\n+Jumpjets!\n+Free to Play with not alot of Pay to Win content (A Bike/LGV is great for running around, but I believe you can get one early on now, instead of waiting to level a frame to 25)\n+Cash shop items can be bought with in-game currency.\n+5 base frames with different playstyles mixed in with a fair number of advanced frames to change it up.\n+Customization of your character is free (recent patch gave everyone all the haircuts/facial hair options)\n\nCONS:\n-Not a huge amount of things to do once you've hit max level (level 40 right now)\n-Glitches/bugs can sometimes be an issue (which is normal for an newly released game, sadly)\n-Mostly a PvE (Player vs environment) game with a PvP (Player vs Player) mode and area sort of tacked on.\n-Is a bit grindy ( at least your not paying for it, eh?)\n-Some parts of the game aren't as well balanced as they could be.\n-Crafting in the game is widely considered a bit of a joke and a waste of time (Recent patch has reduced the cost of some items as well as allowing for you to pick what subtype of item you want, but the reseach costs I believe have stayed the same. Less of a crapshoot, but still costly).","October 20, 2014","true","448.2"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","13","22","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bryanharmon/recommended/227700/","bryanharmon","Harmon--twitch.tv/harmon7805","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bryanharmon/","104 products in account","This is a Borderlands type MMOFPS. It's basically a beautiful, open world play ground where you roam from job to job, while enroute being constantly side tracked with fun events that randomly spawn through the world. Every 2 or 3 levels the game moves you to a new location, keeping things fresh. Hang gliding through the sky never gets old. The core game is PvE based and highly encourages players to help each other as you pass by them. Everyone reaps the rewards as long as you pitch in. The crafting system is fun along with the mining system. Send a thumper crashing into the earth to mine resources. Refine those resources. Research abilities, weapons etc from research points you get from salvaging junk and old gear and then craft items based on all of those factors. The instance based missions are challenging if you do not get a fair amount of players on your team. The voice acting is great and the graphics are still nice to look at after almost 40 hours of gameplay.\n\nThings that I do not care for. Job board missions take you all over the map. This is to entice you to purchase either VIP which gives you a special anytime glider pad to put down or purchase a motorcycle. Motorcycles are badass but cost a ridiculous amount of real world money. There is a way to exchange in game currency for Red Beans (real world $) but as usual this takes such a grind that you would have to "dedicated" (a nice way to put it) to get anywhere doing it. I have VIP'd a for a few months but I also think that is a little pricey as well.\n\nThe cosmetics for your player are great. Battleframes to purchase with real money look great along with accessories. All the class in the game are available for free and all are fun to play. Whether your healing or throwing down turrets or just walking down Chosen with a huge gun. There is something for every play style.\n\nThis game took a beating in the reviews when it first dropped but has greatly improved since. It is free to try and definitely worth a shot.","October 21, 2014","true","34.4"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","13","22","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/excruciate/recommended/227700/","excruciate","Excruciate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/excruciate/","717 products in account","YES I recommend this game! I've been playing it since way back in 2013 beta and even before that. There are some things that have changed for the better, some not. At first a character leveling system with zones with suggested level requirements seemed like a bad idea because while the game was back in beta everything was no level and free open roam. The game is one big grindfest from start to finish and everything starts to feel the same fast, but there are much more side things to do now to help lessen the grind and many more areas to explore. The combat is somewhat more janky than a AAA could have done with the game but after getting used to it and cutting them some slack because they are a indie dev, the game's combat can be pretty enjoyable. I personally just wished the game's combat mechanics would have evolved and feel more smooth but the combat is the same now as it was in early beta years ago. However overall it is pretty satisfying once you get into it. Pretty much the game's biggest problem is just being extremely grindy.\n\nThe game looks and sounds beautiful. The graphics are, generally speaking, not great in technical terms. But what makes the game look so outstanding are the color palette's used and the art direction, and the colors of the water and the sky. Everything does look very good art-wise and pretty clean. The game is bright when it needs to be bright, without being offensive, and in darkness everything being lit up at night looks fantastic. The sounds are great and the music sets the tone perfectly for whichever situation you are in. Definitely one of the best looking games you can find.\n\nFlying on gliders across beautiful landscapes and riding a badass fast motorcycle across them never gets old. But continually grinding BK and job boards does. Thankfully you can mix it up and while doing a job board mission you can do side activities on the map while in the mission.\n\nThe game has shaped up nicely over the years. It stayed in beta so long I thought it would never be released. I have put a lot of hours into it and have just recently got back into it after over a year absence. Do I miss how it was back in beta, the no levels, go anywhere you want/thump anywhere you want world? Absolutely. But the game has not changed for the worse. There is a lot more in the game to do now and a lot more areas to explore. So overall, I like what I see right now and will be putting some more time into the game for at the very least a moderate while.\n\n*** A quick word on optimization/coding. It isn't optimized and/or coded so great. I don't run it on ultra with my gtx 970 because in big events it gets hardcore slowdown. 'Very high' is where I run it, and switch to high or medium during massive event firefights. The game has its share of hiccups and stutters, but not bad stutters from video problems, just some hiccuping from latency and texture loading and even occasional rubber banding, but overall not enough to detract from your experience provided you have both good internet and a good gpu. ***\n\nOne of the best, or at least most fun, mmo's out there that is f2p. Tons of fun, especially to play with friends. Do not pass this up if you like mmo's, third person shooters, or top notch art direction. Just be prepared to invest a lot of time into it unless you bore easily from inevitable grinding.\n\n8/10","August 16, 2015","true","61.6"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","13","22","0","0"

Your skill will dictate your progress and rewards.  Perhaps, your rewards more than your progress.  Sometimes, the two are inter-connected.  It's possible to be in the same place as another player experiencing the same objective.  Yet, because you didn't contribute as much to the battle, your experience will be lower. You'll recieve no reward.  In some cases you may not get anything.  This feature ends the idea of someone being carried by the team -"Riding on the shoulders of others."\n\nYou decide your level of involvement.  That being said, I can understand one's desire to level up to the max as swiftly as plausible.  Don't do that.  Take your time.  It's an open world game with much to do.  There's no reason to do everything as fast as possible.  You have to get your videogame foreplay on - Yeah, I said it!\n\nThe game has bugs up the wazooo.  This is true.  What I've experienced are clipping into a rock and having myself auto suicide - not cool bro.  The other problems are weird interface bugs mostly tied to selecting items in a stats screen -Sometimes nothing works, WTF man?!\n\nWhen a game is fun you can tolerate a few bugs.  It remains to be seen of they will be fixed.  I hope that they are.\n\nI like the crafting system in the game. I also like how that system makes it feasible to make almost everything you have the option to purchase either via real money or in-game currency.  You don't have to pay to play or pay dominate the world. You can purchase a VIP membership that boosts your XP and other features but the game also gives you a free daily boost for 1 hour so that's sugoi.\n\nI hope that the world gets bigger and better because I really like it.  Did I mention that I really like the day and night cycles.  Somethings the atmosphere is very pretty.  Firefall is a very beatiful game.  Sometimes the view and the lighting can give, "FarCry" a run for it's money.  But then the character models in this game through me off a bit.  They look like poser models to me.  It's not that bad but it leaves me with a little, meh in my mind.\n\nI know that a game like this is very challenging to make and maintain.  They did a good job despite some internal tumoil at the company.  As a designer, I know that this business is not a walk in the park.  It's hard work and you want to keep it fun.  If it's not, then what's the point of it all?  Money as creative impetus never lasts and it looks like they had fun making many parts of this game.\n\nRed5, you guys gotta get back to basics and have fun.  It's the only way that the world you have created will continue to florish.  It's paramount to make it the game that you want and hold on to it.  You can't be everything to everyone.

It's also the most fun I've had in an MMO. I don't really even know how to describe this game. It's had a crazy long open beta, a lot of bad press, and an incredibly rough development. It still manages to be a unique diamond in the rough. I bet it will have a ton of bugs when it comes out on the 29th, but give it some time. This game is amazing despite adversity, and I have a feeling it's going to keep on getting better.","July 8, 2014","true","430.9"," 19 of 34 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","19","34","0","0"

Here's what my opinions are.\n\n1) Don't complain if the games feels the same type of mission all over again, ALL GAMES are like that including REAL LIFE.\n\n2) The borderlands game franchise feels right in this game, which is a plus.\n\n3)Open world, lots of places to go through out all countries all areas. It's how you progress that lets you explore.\n\n4)Slow lvl system so that no one can just burst through levels, they actually gotta craft, get better gear, team up to complete missions.\n\n5) By judging at this game as a closed beta tester, I say there's lots of new contents/DLCs the devs can do.\n\n6) Cool customizations, guns, rides and also the texture of the world itself.\n\n7) my personal favourite, it makes you immerse into FireFall universe.\n\nHere's the cons\n\n1) Some gears can be purchase so those who spent on real $$ have the better chance of Solo-ing or PVP\n\n2) The Quest board is a little bit slow on loading the next objective, a minor complain but still need to improve on that.\n\n3) It wouldn't hurt if there's cinematics after certain levels you have gone up to. It makes the game more attractive, more fun, and you will feel like you're doing something like SWTOR. They have each cinematics after each mission completed, which is why the story line is darn good. I just hope FireFall will take that as a consideration.\n\nDO I recommend this game? I say YES, this is BY far the second or THE BEST Shooter MMO besides Defiance of course.\nYou shoot monsters, bandits all sorts of Aliens that screwing you. It's a war here, just like Borderlands, Defiance ect. Also it takes place in the future on earth and you need to defend it.","July 22, 2014","true","6.3"," 19 of 34 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","19","34","0","0"

Name one MMO that does not have a grind of some fashion... go ahead... I'll wait... That's right, you can't! So while this game has a grind, it's a LOT more satisifying because of the gameplay itself. The fast paced, skill based shooter mechanics are wonderful and help keep the game entertaining.\n\nThe people that complain about the "grind to unlock advanced battleframes"... they are doing it wrong. Simple as that. While you can spend money to unlock them, or level up to Level 40 with each of the battleframes... you can also buy them off the Auction House with credits you earn in-game. "BUT THAT IS A GRIND!" ... not really! You get a mineral called Crystite that you can directly exchange for Credits. By the time you reach level 15, you can EASILY have enough credits to buy an advanced battleframe. Look under the "Unlocks" tab, they are typically 4-6k credits. At level 22, I have 18k credits. Sell what you dont need.... convert to credits... DONE! In half a day of playing, I have unlocked 4 advanced battleframes. You can also use Credits to buy ANYTHING that you could spend cash on. DO NOT LET PEOPLE FOOL YOU because they didnt see the information right in front of their eyes.\n\nYes, questing consists of going to a Job Board, accepting a quest, and turning it back in. This can feel grindy, but remember... name an MMO that doesnt do this? The difference is that you also have world events going on almost 100% of the time. So jump in and help defend or attack a location. You don't even have to be there for the full encounter... just kill a few things and you will get FULL credit for completion.  Leveling is incredibly fast if you get into the habit of actually looking at what is going on in the world around you.\n\nThe customization options in this game are AMAZING! You can freely switch the way you look, your battleframe's colors/patterns, your cosmetic gear, etc... at any of the "New You" stations or Battle Garage (located in every quest hub, city, and outpost. They are everywhere!\n\nYou can spend money... or you can simply look at what the game has to offer... You can buy ANYTHING and EVERYTHING with in-game credits. You can sell EVERYTHING. And everytime you complete a Job Board quest, you get a token to take to a slot machine for bonus prizes... some of which are worth quite a bit!\n\nI HIGHLY recommend this game to everyone. This is game isn't perfect and it is not for everyone... but if you like fast paced shooters with an amazing open world and the ability to jump in and out of encounters, plus being rewarded for helping other players... THIS GAME IS FOR YOU!\n\n","July 29, 2014","true","41.1"," 22 of 40 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","22","40","0","0"

Good environment, good background story, nice praphics and a very good soundtrack. And when you start playing for your first couple of hours the game feels very good as well and seems to be a lto ot fun. That is until you've played a while, have hit level 15 or so and see the repeting of missions starting.\n\nFirefall uses 'Job Board's to give you missions. Sadly the number of different missions is pretty limited. This results in missions starting to repeat themself, though not literally, but you will see the same kind of objective on new places and an other sugarcoat around it.\n\nSkills and progression is an issue as well. You only have 4 skills and at level 8 you alreayd have them all. At that point you'll only be working on upgrading the skills itself. Either through research & crafting or by grinding vouchers to buy them from NPCs. Research & crafting really takes forever, while vouchers drop you back in the repeatative mission grind.\n\nOn a positive note, the cash shop is not Pay2Win. There are no game breaking items in there, and you can obtain the cash shop currency (Red Beans) from in-game grinding. With that, cash shop items are tradeble, and you can find almost everything from it on the auction house.","August 6, 2014","false","20.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

Just going to start off by saying I've been around with Firefall for ages now, all the way back since closed alpha, hell my character is still the same original one. Over the years I have seen A LOT of core game changes, like so many I don't even remember all of them. A few changes were for the better, such as when progression was sideways, you aren't trying to gain levels but work on aspects about your frames by gathering resources to use. At least to memory this was my favorite of the systems, it was good.\n\nSo right now we're sitting at version 1.7 if I'm not wrong, and yet again more changes to the core systems. Battleframe cores, which wasn't something I liked all that much to begin with, are now gone and replaced with generic armor pieces.  Old modules were replaced with new ones, honestly can't tell you why this was changed. Best guess is to have one kind of module rather than weapons and ability varients, still all in all I don't know why this even happened.\n\nEntire weapon classes have been changed, and this one seriously pisses me off. Rhinos are one of the dreadnaught arctype frames that used to carry a laser heavy machine gun, it was pretty awesome, and it worked basically how it sounds, a machine gun that shoots lasers. It also had an alternate fire that was a fairly neat and useful single continuous beam. Well the new Photon Lance has all the features of the old laser HMG, but without the machine gun part. To put it bluntly, what used to be an alt fire is now a completely standalone weapon. Oh it also has a fantastic range of 20 meters which basically puts the least defensive of the slow dreadnaught frames at a very close range to the enemy. Makes complete sense obviously.\n\nLook, Firefall is my baby. It is a game that I've been coming back to time and time again over the ages, no other MMO has ever received the same treatment from me. I care about this game a lot, and I seriously want it to succeed, believe me. Just... someone out there has decided to shoot themselves in the foot in a really bad way, in the past Firefall has been amazing and fun as hell. That Firefall isn't what we have anymore, its a shame honestly. Well, with the game's constant history of changes maybe we'll see something good again in the future, but I don't think so.","May 22","false","116.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I wish more games would take the approach in a way that atleast when I look at areas specially the newbie zones they be bit easy to traverse through - I kept on flying to timbaktu trying to get to the marker that my quest showed. Same reason i never liked WILDSTAR too the starting zones were just too confusing to my taste - ofcourse you are suppose to read the wall of text that follows the quest but most of us don't do that. I never really cared about lores or story really. The games should ease in player and then throw them into more complex terrains to traverse through later on.\nMaybe i just don't like steampunk/sci fi lores. Also early zones there is vast unexplored sea area but don't think you can go into deep waters.\n\nOn flip side - gliding is fun till it lasts. Jetpacks is fun. Sniping was fun but you don't kill anything one shot even if they are well within your level range.\n\nAnd from looks of it this looks like Pay-2-Win or atleast make your life easy scenario - which is most of MMO these days. This doesn't appeal to me much. But I would like to say this is probably the better version of FPS/MMO genere out there. The review will be updated as I try it more.","August 3, 2014","false","5.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

If you like Borderlands or other FPSs, this is well worth a try.  It's truly free-to-play; you can play this indefinitely without paying a cent- you will not reach a point that you have to cough up money for.  Leveling will take you a bit longer without buying VIP membership (which boosts XP and some other things), but it's not all that big of a deal.  I have friends that have played for over 100 hours without buying anything.  Plus, you can buy the vast majority of items with in-game money if you want to put the time in.\n\nThe big draw for this is the fun of leveling different classes, and developing gear.  There is more end-game stuff to do than in Borderlands, for instance.  Don't get me wrong... the BL franchise is my favorite by far, but you reach a point where you have everything and have done everything.  I found that in FF, there is always something to do, if you adjust yourself to wanting to do it.  If you can find a few buddies or join a squad/ army, the possibilities increase.  The MMO feature allows you to meet new players, if you want to, and go from there.\n\nI've read the negative reviews, and most of them seem to come from disappointed beta players.  I came to the game just after official release, so I can't really speak to what is was like and what may or may not have changed.  There is a grinding aspect to the leveling, but more so because there are 16 frames to level up, if you want.  However, it's no more grindy than BL, with the increasing level caps and having to repeat Vault Hunter modes several times.\n\nSo, I'd strongly recommend giving this a try.  I continue to be surprised that more people haven't tried it, but I suspect it's because of suspicion about the MMO feature.  I felt the same way, but I gave it a try.  What game have you played that you can play for a year or more and still find fun things to do in it?\n\nGraniteHead1","June 11, 2015","true","729.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I have several thousand hours put into this game, though the amount shown on Steam is certainly lessbecause Firefall only went onto Steam somewhat recently. I have played, levelled, and mastered nearly every battleframe (battleframes are Firefall's version of classes) and have been endgame in every major expansion this game had since the release.\n\nFirefall is an open world MMORPG that is played as either a third person or first person shooter. It is a scifi style game in the future, so your guns and equipment are futuristic and you get a jetpack that lets you fly/hover in the vast open world. Combat is extremely fluid and the class (battleframe) options let people of all play styles enjoy the game in their own way. Do you like to jump around while shooting, being extremely agile and hard to hit? Pick an assault battleframe. Do you prefer sitting in the back while sniping? Recon battleframes are right for you. There are many other options to choose from if you have different play styles, and you have access to every frame on one character (though you have to unlock the ones you didn't choose to start with).\n\nThe story is original, the graphics are appealing, the audio effects are nice, and the character customization options are awesome. Unlike most MMORPG's, you can change your character appearance and sex for free, so your customization options are completely unrestricted. There are many different ways to build your character for combat, with tons of different upgrades to weapons, a perk system, multiple weapons to choose for each battleframe, plenty of secondary weapons, and a wide variety of abilities. The game is completly free to play and you never get forced to pay real money. Firefall is not even close to pay to win. Spending real money gets you: cosmetics, experience boosts, toys, and currency conversion (which you can easily get for free with ingame currency as well).\n\nThe community is AMAZING. If someone asked me which game I think has the best community, I would immediately answer Firefall. Even GM's come and play with us, creating massive events that give amazing rewards just for fun. To me and many others, this community is a family, and every new player is welcome.\n\nFirefall sounds pretty great, right? Well, a lot of people are leaving/complaining about the game because of some big changes that happened in January 2016. The game used to have a lot more content, more open world zones, more raids, a better story, and fewer bugs. After the big update in January, the game essentially became a worse version of itself. There are a lot of bugged missions that may make levelling a bit more annoying because players will have to find working jobs/missions. If you can ignore the bugs, Firefall is actually a great game still. Sure, it's not what it used to be, but it isn't bad.\n\nThe game is free, so it's always worth a shot. Playing with friends would definitely make the game a lot more fun, so try and talk to others in the zone chat. Firefall players are generally very friendly and helpful. Firefall is one of those games that can keep you hooked for ages, so if you want something fresh and exciting to keep you going for the next few weeks, months, or even years... you've come to the right place.","May 4","true","713.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

When the closed beta first began, there was little more than instanced PvP on a single map, and Red 5 has slowly but surely fleshed out a MASSIVE and incredibly detailed game world full of activities and adventure.\n\nThis is not your average shooter, nor is it your average MMO - but rather a truly sandbox world in which you are free to explore and tackle any activity you desire, whether that is completing missions from an ARES Job Board, roaming the world in search of wandering encounters, harvesting minerals while fighting off huge waves of enemies via the process of "Thumping", tackling campaign missions which help tell the story of the world around you, or jumping into a squad with friends and participating in some high level open-world PvP.\n\nStarting with the default 5 battleframe archetypes, you will gain access to advanced frames over time which fill more specialized roles. Your character can jump into any of your unlocked battleframes at any time, allowing you to change your playstyle to suit your mood or desired activity. You will level each battleframe individually (similar to leveling a character in a traditional MMO), finding, purchasing, or crafting gear along the way.\n\nThere are 5 man instances (complete with a "hardcore" mode for high level characters), 20 man end-game raids, and as previously mentioned, a massive open-world PvP zone to explore.\n\nFor fans of first-person or third-person shooters and action games, I highly recommend checking out the world of New Eden. It can be a bit daunting figuring out what to do at the start, but stick with it, and join an Army early on, so you always have people to play with. You'll be having a blast in no time!\n\nGood luck Ares 3-5.","July 8, 2014","true","903.7"," 25 of 46 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","25","46","0","0"

FireFall is an addictive MMOFPS with a mixure of elements from Borderlands, Sanctum 2, an a little bit of Section 8, and while it doesn't deliver on the best aspect of each one, the way it meshes together is really great, and adds for a fun experience. The way people get together whenever a mission pops up, while not original (I heard Guild Wars 2 has a similar mechanic), is a blast, which raises it above other F2P MMOs, and the gun combat is engaging and satisfying. Progression feels genuine, and more often than not, FireFall does NOT feel like a free to play game, though there are times when it does lose that illusion, such as a store window popping up for "red beans" and cosmetic items.","August 27, 2014","true","12.6"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

So far I've been impressed and have been more into playing this than Advanced Warfare (I got both at the same time). The game is open world and full of things to do, giving the player hours of enjoyment.\n\nOne thing that I love about the game is aesthetics, which most games (especially in the triple A industry) don't have. The colors green and blue are quite common. It's nice for some producers to understand that we don't all want maps or overworlds that are obliterated. A large undevastated world awaits people. I wouldn't say it'll make your jaw drop, but you'll notice some other colors in the world.\n\nThe combat is a little wobbly with the game lagging or freezing for a brief moment. However, as long as your internet is decent and your computer can run the game semi-well then you shouldn't have an issue. Now, I mentioned AW for one reason. Both of these games involve vertical gameplay somewhat. AW you have the extra jump, and in this game you have a jumpjet (I call them jetpacks). It makes it fun when you need to avoid an enemy, so you jump around him like a queer fairy lighting him or them up. The combat is interesting, but quickly turns into a grind, as most mission involve you going to a location to kill something or escort, or rescue. But all of them involve you killing something.\n\nAs for the pay system, it's overpriced. After a while I decided to look into some outfits. I picked out the Bandit eye goggles and the straw hat. 240 Red Bean total, or to put it in easy to understand term, $25. No, not going to happen. You can earn virtually everything in-game by grinding it, but it'll take some time.\n\nOverall it's a good game. 7/10\n","November 13, 2014","true","27.9"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","0"

The scenery is AMAZING, but the battleframes are junk compared to what they were, dont even care about the damage aspect of it, its what they did to the abilities and modules.\n\nIf i was a new player and 1.6 was my first build to play, then it wouldnt have such an impact other than reading a flooded chat lobby of everyone complaining about how messed up everything is now. 3 major impacts that really ruined what the game was is leading me to not want to play because the way the game was in 1.3 was what i wanted the game to be in terms of abilities/weapons etc. Sure there were some glitches, and some overpowered weapons/abilities/perks, but instead of ballancing that stuff, they trashed everything in a "throw it up in the air" manner.\n\nThe new method in equiping your battleframe is great how they itemized sections of the frame, the upgrades to the terrain are most excellent, but the mutillation of abilities just makes everything feel week and limited. All the time and effort put into learning, gathering, crafting etc, wasnt properly addressed in the compensation package they offered.\n\nAll of the modules previously mounted on weapons and abilities are gone now, and salvaging what was left over doesnt cover replacing what was there before.\n\nI understand with a new build, there are going to be glitches and bugs etc, but playing the game over to get a far shadow of what was, is really hard to get behind and into.....\n\nIf you are a "new" player and never played 1.3... GO FOR IT, mute the chat box, and blast away!!! If youre a 1.3 fan, then by all means get your feet wet, but if rhino, bastion or firecat were your top frames, then you decide.\n\nNot a fan at all","January 23","false","396.4"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/raycharr/recommended/227700/","raycharr","Ray Charles","http://steamcommunity.com/id/raycharr/","84 products in account","I downloaded this game with good hopes, and when I finally started playing it, I lost all hope. This game is 8GB of glitches and bugs.\n\nMost of the quests are simply walking from Point A to Point B, then killing either 5 People with spikes on thier heads and arms who were chosen for something, or killing 30 Crab-Bug things that spawn with different abilities such as the power to commit suicide and slow you down for all of 3 seconds, and usually there is a group of about 5 to 10 Able-Bodied soldiers with Guns and Armor more powerful than yours that are sitting there acting like a civillian and the quest says "HELP them kill 30 Crab-Bug things" yet if they do ever decide to move thier arms up to the gun that is mysteriously floating infront of them and KILL SOMETHING, IT DOESN'T COUNT TOWARDS THE QUEST THEREFORE IT ISN'T HELPING AT ALL! Half the time when you have to kill a large amount of things they barely spawn and when they do the soldiers decide to move thier arms up to the mysteriously floating gun infront of them and kill it before you do and then you don't get to make ANY progress towards the quest and it will take about 10 minutes just for the Crab-Bugs to respawn and then they kill them again and basically from there on it's basically the same thing over and over until you get enough kills to finish the quest, and then it's back to Point A (usually on the other side of whatever town your closest to) and then you get barely any EXP and it takes about 20 more quests like that to get to the next level. And that's just the questing system.\n\nThe main reason I even slightly wanted this game was because I heard my friends talking about Motorcycles and Hang Gliding and doing this thing called "Thumping" where they have to defend some sort of mining rig while waves of mobs are thrown at them. Hang Gliding was probably the best part of the game in my opinion, Except for when you even slightly look up your thrown at the ground and your hang glider gets destroyed. You can't even get a Motorcycle until level 25 or apparently if you buy some DLC then you can have it from the start, along with an infinite use Rainbow Hang Gliding Pad. Also, you can't hang glide unless you step on some sort of magic pad on the ground that gives you a hang glider. Did I mention it takes a couple hours of questing to level up?\n\nAnother problem I have with this game is the NPC's. The Soldiers will wander around dangerous areas and act like civillians, and the civillians will walk around safe areas acting like they are holding a gun whenever they aren't and acting like a soldier.\n\nAnd also, the character customization is awesome! (No it's not) Everything is free! (No it's not) And everything totally doesn't require some form of VIP currency! (Yes it does)\n\nI think you should take my advice and NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME! IT IS NOT WORTH IT! IT IS VERY GLITCHY AND BUGGY! Unless they take a Hot Iron to the game and Iron out all the bugs, I'm never downloading it again.","August 5, 2014","false","4.6"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

Alot of the changes are pretty nice too.  The beta was a glitchy, buggy, repetitve(thou still could/can be), and kinda boring due to not having any content in the game to be involved with).  Since my few hours or so playing on the steam release I do gotta say....thank god no more half pants battle thongs on my bastion battleframe chick! lol (you beta guys know what i'm talking about). Anyway, here's my pro's and con's so far for new players interested in Firefall...\n\nPROS:\n-Beautiful graphics and not too tolling on mid-grade computers\n-Action based combat system (no point and click)\n-Rewarding Dynamic Events\n-Simple crafting system (All depends on the person, some people like more complex crafting, I just find this one easy to learn and use.) (CRAFTABLE MOTORCYCLE AT LEVEL 25, AFTER DOING BOARD MISSION IN DREDGE CALLED "In the Wheelhouse" *hint hint*)\n-Guild Wars 2 style market system (trade in-game currency for cash-shop currency system)\n-Storyline/Personal mission progression added to the game since beta ( looks like they might develop more story later on)\n-Voice Acting for every mission and dynamic events (note: some of it is a bit amateur, but hey...i've heard worse in dubbed anime)\n-Leaching from squad thumpers don't hurt the thumper owner now\n-NO pay to win cash shop grabs; this one is an important one i look at when hopping into a free to play mmorpg. I'm a heavy pvper and the first thing i look at is, is the guy with the fatter wallet gonna kick my ♥♥♥?  This game avoids that 100%, everything in the cash shop is all cosmetic or getting cooler looking  and faster moving mounts and gliders and VIP boosts which just helps speed up leveling and crafting processes.\n-NO restrictions on free to play users\n\nCONS:\n-Server stability could be a little better (we'll probly see some fixes for that soon; this could be due to busy servers)\nexampes:  -occasional long loading time for missions  -occasional rubber banding\n-Gets repetitive at times\n-They are still working on balancing issues between battleframes for pvp\n-Farm heavy when focusing on crafting\n-Currency exchange: Red Beans(cash shop currency) can be bought with Credits(Marketplace currency) at a minimum of 100 Credits (Which doesn't bother me personally, but could have some more freedom on that depending on the playerbase economy)\n-3d modeling on characters could be better aswell as some of the cosmetic customization\n-Limited content compared to other mmo's (more content in the future i hope)\n-Able to unlock another battleframe only by getting a battleframe to level 40, using red beans, or buying the battleframe off the marketplace for a few thousand credits\n\nThis is now my final review, now that i've put a good amount of time playing the released game.  I really enjoy this game personally and see much potential for it to develop into a bigger more grand mmo.  Keep in mind that this Pro's and Con's list was made for new players that haven't played beta. There are many things I miss from beta that I personally wish were still in the game, but who knows, maybe they'll add some stuff back in later. Anyway...I highly recomment this game, it's great for what it is. Especially if you're looking for a free to play game that doesn't restrict you heavily unless you got a fat wallet.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read my review and please rate the review as you see fit.","July 30, 2014","true","525.7"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

The end game raids are chaotic but the classes are all too independent and theres very little incentive to actually work together the "instances" are even worse there are only a few and theyre almost identical to the rest of the game. Theres little variety in environments and I'm not sure why the second area(of three) is supposedly in brazil when its clearly designed as a depiction of the American West, Overall the emphasis on gunplay and movement enhances the early game experience but by the late game starts feeling more repetitive than any other MMO combat model I've played(theres a reason most shooters are only a few hours long and rely heavily on prescripted events). In the end its alright but as with most MMOs unless you turn it into a social affair youll run out of enthusiasm for it long before the developers intended for you to. In the end I'll recommend it Just because its free though I wouldnt advise spending any money on it.","October 28, 2014","true","94.3"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","8","13","0","0"

Quests have you trek for stupidly long distances on foot, then take almost a minute to load the next objective for you after you get there (and the next objective is a mile away). The "random" encounters and events are very predictable and can be camped all day for an easy grind. Enemy movement seems very buggy, as they'll sometimes slide around at high speed, and other times walk normally. Weapons feel bad to use, just generic hitscan pew pew rifles and such.\n\n\nThe game does look decent however (as long as you don't go off the beaten path, then you'll be greeted by low res textures that would've been disgusting even in the 90s), and the resource gathering and crafting are fairly enjoyable, but not enough to make up for the game's shortcomings.\n\n3/10, such a shame.","August 11, 2014","false","30.9"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","2"

Then 0.5 happen an the skill aspect began to fate away, and then hackers began over running the PVP. Then they added 15 frames removing the ability to customize your frames, and adding a grindy unenojable progession system. Then the game just turned into a stupid AOE spamming party with 2 seconds CD on abilities that would last 6-10 seconds. Lasty we have this a game with feature that are all poorly designed, very grindy, boring instances, unbalanced PVP that full of hackers, and with zero sandbox elements because of the new leveling system forcing players to stay in area that fit there level an following the dull mission board story line.\n\nMy best time playing this game was when they first added the chosen war system which made chosen come out of the melding, and take over watchtowers an towns. I would be heading to a town after gather materials thumbing an as i was heading back i would see a massive chosen platton just walk out of the melding, and starting capturing watchtower. Now chosen invasion are scripted events that happen ever so an so hours an weather you win them or not they don't affect anything.\n\nAn the gameplay so boring, and easy now i can solo a Squad 3 thumber with max level enemies. When they first added thumber soloing a personal thumber was brutal most people could barely fill it to 50%, Now enemies would be lucky if the health of a squad 3 thumber that being defend by one player falls under 75%.\n\nOverall if you really want to enjoy this game beg the developers to reset the game to 0.4 or 0.5 (if you can stand the stupid poorly designed Tech tree progession) I personal liked 0.5 the most the tech tree was stupid, but the gameplay was great.","December 10, 2014","false","62.6"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

But reading some of the other comments some people do not feel the same way, so Im giving my views on the key issues people are talking about below. I hope you all atleast try the game and judge it yourself not what I or some one else says.\n\nWell I played more then some of these most helpful reviews. I will be honest and will be fair I played sicne the 2nd beta wave. Since then I played 5 differnt games called firefall all were great some were better but this lastest one isnt bad. I like the levels give the game some direction (Some people may not like direction but it helps the most of us out imo). I love the new crafting system anyone seen the old one would of died trying to figure it out, sure some of the things have long research or build times just like ESO so log on put some thing on the cooker go to work come back bam its done! Yo umay want to plan ahead with the crafting system which some may see as a draw back but you dont have to afk  smelting like other mmos such as WoW. The class system, I have most of the classes but I do prefer the odler way of getting classes, but now you max a character then get a new one or farm one out with credits (In game currency) which isnt easy but isnt hard either after you do it amny time it may get old but take it slow enjoy the game dont rush it.\n\nYou get a free Bike if you do the right quest I had seen compalints about it but if there giving them away (Mid/late game) dont complain about them selling to those who "want" it early game since they have a decent taxi systemj early game making bike not a need but a want. When you "need" a bike is when you get the quest for it.

Everything in the game can be bought off the market, including the RedBeans, (Real Money Currency). The leveling system is like most MMO minus you only have one character, and use battleframes which hold the levels on each frame.\n\nThe crafting system is coming along, i would assume it will still being tweak after the 29th, but once you figure out salvaging, and research points, you will be crafting in no time.\n\nFirefall feels like a true living world, and a game.

A name that means bugger all, yet is still easily insulted. Firefall is an FPSMMORPG and maybe some other letters of the alphabet with lyrics within songs that suspiciously remind of you of ♥♥♥♥. What kind? ♥♥♥♥ed if I knew, the blue kind that comes out of Aranhas. The crab-like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s within this game. You could even add RTS genre if you were commanding the monsters against the worthless human scum-- Which sounds like a much better game.\n\nAnyway, Firefall is of a genre that even when abbreviated is longer than its actual full name. But at least games no longer have fifty seven digits after them, or enough colons to make a hard drive dry heave into the jet-blasters.\n\nOh, right, Firefall. The story starts after everything interesting happened, where the terrans, no not those ones, discover a space rock, made a ship from it because they suddenly know what space rock does, And then smashed it into the planet for plot! Well, that's my guess at least. They don't really explain why the ship crashes into the earth. Either way you were hired to use gun on bandit. Possibly smash it in the face- which is actually a more viable strategy than the guns that might as well fire BB'S. Unless you're the assault where the BB's shatter. Though, there aren't really that many bandits, it's mostly the wildlife because that's suddenly more dangerous than human with gun.\n\nActually, everyone whinges about these space f*cks that invade earth or whatever, but you never see them until about 10 hours in, or perhaps the story quests that you only have within the first area. But who cares about the story? Well, Me. The sole patrionist of Single player. Though the story is fun, I guess. But again, it's only in the first area, so there's nothing to interest you after the first area.\n\nToo many negatives! I need to put my smiley mask on and dance around this pile of ♥♥♥♥ pretending to look I know what I'm doing, I mean until I find a good spot, like looking for carrot within vomi- I can't use that analogy because that's not hard to fin- OH I FOUND ONE! The class system is probably the best part of the game. There are five classes, 11 more that you can unlock either by dinging to level 40 with one class or using micro <Dry heave> micro transactions.\n\n"But wait!" I hear you say. "I thought you were going to talk about the good parts?" Oh, ♥♥♥♥, right. Well, you can change class whenever you find a station. You essentially change clothes, but whatever ♥♥♥♥ing reason you forget all your old skills and abilities or whatever. You do keep all your crafting <dry heave> stuff. What is it with MMO's - Wait, with ANY game now days that includes crafting. You keep all your weapons too. Though for some stupid ♥♥♥♥offing reason you have limited inventory space eventhough you have to keep everything for every single class ever. And to finish the game 100% you have to play the game about 16 times\n\nI've managed this long without mentioning Navi- I mean the Goddess- I mean cu- Oh f*ck it, Aero. It's your decision on whatever you call her. Perhaps a French/Russian Navi who likes reminding you how what a "great job" you did "taking out that bandit camp". F*ck off Navi, I was hiding in the corner sucking my thumb because I was an engineer who was only good for hiding behind his turret, and demanding it to do all the work.\n\nThough if you've ever played the game, you would be yelling at me that it is pretty. The game is split into three sections, Coral forest, Desert, volcano. You can already see where this is going, can't you? The game starts out beautiful, and then suddenly Brown. Brown everywhere! Like you mixed all your colours together and threw them against the monitor. I actually quite enjoyed Firefall in Coral forest. It had the story mission, beautiful areas, fun missions and you didn't want to hang every character you met.\n\nYou then get to the second area which is a pain in my ♥♥♥♥ to navigate. You get a vehicle at the start of the area, which is nice, but what the f*ck is that going to do when the rest of the game mostly has canyons? There are also consumable glider pads which make navigation that much more fun from higher areas, but I swear the canyons were designed to be big enough for you to not be able to fly over. It is as if they do not want you to get to your destination. One town genuinely has been walled off so there's only one way in.\n\nSo previously the game was in all the colours of the rainbow, which enjoyed dancing across the room, jumping into your eyes then f*cking your ear lobe. You then enter desert land, lava land with so much brown you would confuse it with a modern FPS.

I liked some of the changes they made since the game had part of Copacabana and mobs dropped Tires as loot.\nBut this final game. Isn't for me anymore.

It's free and as i said, new user experience is quite good. Exploring is cool and even better with friends to goof arround.\nShould you keep playing it?\nNah, Red5 isn't going anywhere with this game.

Everything seems incredibly accessible, tightly packed and gorgeous. A few UI hiccups and the normal MMO bugs like odd mob spawning and lag seem to be worked around so it's not too bad.\n\nI played a bit of closed beta so I'm glad to see this game finally released, I'll update my review after I get a few more levels and hours!\n\n*Edit* 17 hours in and I'm addicted. I've been craving an MMO and FF far exceeded my expectations. I wish it was a bit more FPS than MMO but I can't complain. For a f2p, this game is tight. Better than most current MMO's.\n\n*57 Hours Edit* Well I'm almost level cap and I'm excited to play a new class tomorrow for the actual launch. I'm thinking engineer but I want to hit 40 to get a pilot token and unlock Dragonfly.\n\nI'm upset there's hardly any low level pvp, and I'll give a new edit after I hit cap and kill other people. I'm excited, but almost 60 hours in and I'm almost level cap with the 25% bonus experience, I'm very sure that there's not enough choices when it comes to grinding to get to cap level without VIP status. So while I want to say it'd be an extra 20 hours of grinding, it's even worse than that, because there's hardly enough missions after level 20 to get to the next level appropriate zone even with the Exp Boost. You'll probably end up running around, looking for ARES missions, crashed lgvs/thumpers and tornados.\n\nUnless you just want to Thump all day with people.

It is free to play. You do not have to pay to win, but I would advise a player to at least  buy a glider and bike for traveling purposes. While you can get both without having to pay, it is worth the early investment for time.  I use the glider probably as much or more than the bike. The advanced frames (classes)are unlocked by maxing your level on the regular ones, or you can buy a new frame with the in-game currency. Most real money expenses come from cosmetics an short xp buffs. You don't need them to do well. The classes are all useful in one way or another. The "Thumping" in the game is very enjoyable. Thumping is a way of mining, which is basically a "Protect this drill and kill everything that tries to eat it" game. There are invasions where the enemy Chosen will try to take over a city. There are real consequences if you let them do that (no access to quests/vendors in the area until it is retaken).\nThe storyline is also worth looking into; it will enrich the traveling and questing experience.","July 24, 2014","true","29.1"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","14","25","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Skytis/recommended/227700/","Skytis","Skytis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Skytis/","294 products in account","Not interested in a full review? Well here you go: This game is awesome, one of the best developers (if not the best). Can't see any pay-to-win either. Is pretty grindy, but hey, it's an MMO. Just try it.\n\nI've been in beta for nearly 2 years. This game was in beta for an eternity, because Red 5 actually wanted to release a good game, not like many others today, releasing half-finished/broken games.\nNearly every game system/mechanic has been overhauled a dozen times, which, in my oppinion, shows, that they really want to find the best systems for this game.\nThe developers really listen to the community and are overall just awesome.\nThe game itself has awesome graphics, has a customizable UI and allows UI addons.\nThe story itself seems solid so far, but further episodes are not out yet. Most of the missions are replayable instances which are actually really fun. They also feature hardcore modes with all enemies at the maximum level.\nThe level cap is set at 40, though there are 16 frames (which are kind of like classes) that all have to be levelled individually. To earn experience you either do the mission instances, ARES Jobs/mission which are comparable to repeatable quests in many MMORPGs, do open world events or thump. I'd recommend getting some friends in, since higher quality thumpers (for better resources) and high level ARES Jobs are pretty hard.\nWhat is thumping? It's basically mining. You call down a thumper which attracts enemies and has to be defended by you. Once it's full you recall it and get resources, which are used for crafting.\nCrafting is one of the major aspects in this game. It's one of the ways to acquire better gear. You can also rely on drops, but it will probably take quite some time to find, what you're looking for.\nThe areas are vastly different, you will encounter pretty much everything from frozen to desert, with according enemies.\nIf you're ever bored, just go around and explore the world.\nThe nice thing is: You can go nearly everywhere on the map, no matter the level. You will probably be dying a lot in the high level areas, but it's not all about levels... if you are good at the game, you can also handle high level enemies. It's skill-dependent up to a certain degree.\nThe movement is also very unique in Firefall. You can walk and run, of course, but there are also Light and Medium Ground Vehicles to transport you faster. You have jumpjets, which are like jetpacks. You have enough energy to go about 3 seconds into the air, but it quickly recharges. This system allows for advanced movement. Another way to move around the world are "gliders", which will launch you a few meters in the air and give you temporary wings, allowing you to glide through the air. If you want to go from one major town to another, you can also use the Dropships, which are free. Just enter them and wait to arrive at your destination. You can also directly teleport, but that (at least right now) costs a ridiculous amount of money.\nThere are 5 different types of frames, each with 3 (one with 4) different frames.\n-Assault, which is focused on mobility and damage. The primary damage is a type of plasma cannon, firing a ball of energy, which explodes on impact.\n-Biotech, the healer/poison class, has different primary weapons, depeding on the frame you choose\n-Dreadnaught. Tanky Machine gun dudes. One of the frames has many different weapons, from shotguns over SMGs to Assault Rifles.\n-Engineer, which has a short ranged laser/tesla gun. Supported by his own placed turrets. Can also deploy health/ammo stations, making him a supportive guy.\n-Recon. Sniper. Depeding on the frame, you can have an auto-sniper or charge rifle.\nBut just because the Biotech for example can heal, that doesn't mean that you don't deal damage, every frame can also survive alone, if the player has some skill, but grouping up is of course more effective.\nIf you like supporting others but are afraid that you can't play alone - don't be afraid, you can. Also, you can always group up with some random people around the world.\nEach frame type has the "basic" frame and 2 or 3 advanced versions. Once you hit level 40, you can unlock another frame. The advanced frames have some advantages, making them mandatory, if you wanna go all out on Firefall, but if you just want to play it casually, you don't have to do it - the advanced frames are not even 1.5x stronger than the basic ones.\nAs I just said, if you wanna go all out, you'll have to use the advanced ones, because levelling frames will unlock new perks. Perks are passive abilites which you can equip. Perks cost a certain amount of points, depeding on their tier. You have a limited amount of points which depends on your level, so you have to choose the perks that fit your playstyle/frame best.\n\nEach frame also has 3 skills plus one HKM. The skills are only limited by cooldown and cover nearly everything. Place turrets, heal teammates, poison enemies, burn them, shoot stuff at them, get more defense, etc.\nHKMs are kind of like ultimates. They have to charge up (by doing damage) and deal massive damage or provide a massive buff.\nThe game has a marketplace, where you can buy and sell cosmetics, pets (which have no effect), gear and even Red Beans (real-money currency)! Some people may argue, that it's pay to win, because you can buy good gear with real money, but it can also be obtained by playing the game and as stated before, gear/level isn't everything. You also need skill.\n\nAlso the launcher is quite notable - it uses none (in the Steam version)! It actually updates itself via the Steam-update-system! There are not many MMOs out there which do that...\n\nThere is also Open World PvP, but I haven't tried it yet. If requested, I will add few lines about that. The "problem" with it is, that it's not really balanced, so people of level 40 will have a major advantage over low level players, making open world PvP a type of endgame content.\nRaid bosses are also available at level 40, but since I'm not at that level yet, I can't review those.\n\nOverall an exceptional game, with many unique mechanics.\nThe early levels may be kind of boring, but for me it got more fun, the higher level I got.\n\nNow for the bad things. The ARES Jobs are all pretty similar and repetitive, consisting of much running around and can be pretty tough at higher levels, if done solo. Also there are some bugs, but I haven't encountered anything game breaking yet.\nIf you dislike repetitive questing/grinding* until you reach the level cap, don't like dynamic events or different/unique gameplay Firefall is most likely not the game for you.\n*There are many ways to earn experience, but the most consistent and thus fastest for most players are the repetitive ARES Jobs, or instances which will probably get boring if you do them over and over\n\nWanna know how fast you can reach the level cap? 50-90 hours, depending on skill, playstyle, solo/group, boosts and such stuff. But after reaching the level cap you still need the perfect gear, of course... and levelling the other 15 frames.\nThe first ten levels will take probably 5 hours\n10-20 my guess is 10-20 hours\n20-30 I'd estimate around 20-30 hours\n30-40 will need 40 or more hours\nThese times are assuming that you're new and don't have boosts or anything.\nP.S: It's probably even faster now, since they increased the spawn rate of dynamic events and rewards for ARES Jobs.\n\nIf you have newbish questions about the game, there are many guides on Steam. The official forums have some nice information as well (you might also want to visit them to get some addons). And finally there are "mentors" ingame, people who volunteered to help by answering questions. You can spot them by the green leaf in front of their name.\n\nAnything I forgot?

If you like the feel of an open world environment (like most MMOs) and like third or first person shooters I recommend you give Firefall a try.\n\nMy fav features:\nMovement.  Just getting around in the game is very fun.  Motorcycles, gliders, jump pads and personal jetpacks!\nDynamic quest system.  Repeating a quest does NOT mean you will go to the same location(s).\nOpen world content.  Imagine you are fighting some aliens for a quest and more (aliens, bandits, critters, etc) show up unexpectedly, due to random public content/events.  Time to react or die.  You have to think on your feet and be aware of your surroundings.\nCrafted gear is useful!  A large percentage of the gear I use was crafted by my character.\nOne character, multiple battleframes (classes).  This means that your inventory and crafting is tied to your character, NOT your class.  So your battleframes level independently, but that cool level 20 submachine gun of doom you crafted for your main battleframe is usable by the battleframe you have reserved for playing with your group of friends (once you get that battleframe to lvl 20)\nFree to play which means it should be easy to get your friends to try it.\nYou can buy things with actual money, but it's just cosmetic, quality of life, and fun items.  NO Pay to Win.\nIt's very common to be knocked down and have a complete stranger come by to revive you.\nPlaying with a group is fun.\nWhat I don't like:\nSoftware bugs.  Not a ton, but they are there.  Note:  vendor support is responsive.\nLot's of good changes coming in an update soon (maybe in January).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cain073/recommended/227700/","Cain073","Farker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cain073/","225 products in account","I really want to like this game, but the "2edgy4u" story and hilariously awful voice acting turn me off of it. The shooting mechanics are alright, I guess. All the player models tend to look the same and the game's art style follows the annoying trend of female characters essentially wearing plate bikinis.\n\nThe biggest gripe I have with this game is that its questing system is so unintuitive and boring that I can't even be bothered to play any further. To start questing, you walk up to a job board and it gives you a selection of 5 quests. Every 5 levels, you get a story quest which takes you to the next questing zone. That's it. But the individual non-story quests are probably the most annoying. You get your objective which is probably kill 10 enemies at a location 300 - 700 meters away, and once you kill them, you wait a solid 5 - 20 seconds while the game loads up your next objective. To put that into perspective it takes my computer less time to actually load up the game and log in my character. It really breaks any immersion and it's kind of annoying the 50th time you go through the process of kill, wait, kill some more, wait, return to base.\n\nThe only good thing I have to say about this game is that there's pretty much no loading screens, the game world itself feels very cohesive and the multiplayer aspect of the MMO is used quite well, since you're encouraged to work together with other players. The P2W aspect of the game is also non-existent, since the in-game cash shop is used only for exp boosts, mounts and vanity. However, you are also able to purchase frames (basically classes if you're coming from a more traditional MMO) for red beans (the currency). This is slightly problematic because the game in itself is already quite grindy and to unlock the next frame you must level your current frame up to the level cap (40).\n\nI only got to level 10 before the questing aspect ruined it for me, but you might enjoy it. I did too for an hour.","August 5, 2014","false","6.0"," 18 of 33 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","18","33","0","1"

I love it. Rather than telling you about abstract qualities however, I'll just give an example of play. So this is what happened to me. I began in a richly detailed and populated city wearing a BattleFrame. I moved over to a terminal and got a mission from the local post-apocalyptic authority to help find a lost girl. I moved over to a glider-pad, was launched into the air and with a sonic-boom was projected forward with wings extended. I glided (under my own direction) down to a ridgeline before arriving at a bug-infested canyon. I proceeded to blast and grenade my way to gory victory by engaging in both horizontal and vertical combat before my ‘operator’ told me to start looking inside the bugs for the girl’s genetic material. Awesome.\nWith no genetic material found (she had not been eaten), I was directed over the hill in search of her SIN ID. That was went I came across another player managing a Thumper (basically a piece of mining equipment). She was holding off scores of bandits trying to steal her stuff. Back to back we fought, dropping goons all around us while exchanging instructions and words of encouragement. Achievement and experience were flashing before us as we looted the looters. Nothing was stolen or claimed and everything was fair. Finally, with a cinematic boost, the Thumper launched into the air and I was rewarded. She thanked me before I continued my mission.\nI found the lost girl, finally, who had simply run away from home. As the mission was random (or at least I think it was) she happened to be in the middle of a nest. The ground erupted around us and the fighting began, as I struggled to save her. Turns out a convoy was being attacked nearby too so the result was a three-way firefight that got even more complicated when a team of three other players turned up. The gun-play was amazing and everyone had a great time fighting off the staggering number of critters that were involved. That was when I returned to base and began crafting. Let’s just say that the fun continued long after this.\nThe graphics are amazing, the quests are dynamic, the gameplay is solid and the community is supportive. Seriously, buy this game now.\n","July 23, 2014","true","43.8"," 27 of 51 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","27","51","0","0"

At its current state it has a couple of flaws so your milage on how much you enjoy it might vary.\n\nPros:\nA quite large world to explore and a couple instances to tackle (with an optional hardcore mode for increased challenge)\nFast paced movement (jetpacks!) and skill based shooting (you actually have to aim, no tab targeting)\nTrue "free to play" - You can level to the maximum and play all the content without paying a cent.\nNo "pay to win" - You only pay to speed up progress (xp boost), get conveniance items (e.g. permanent rechargable gliders) and cosmetics. None of this is necessary to level your character. Vehicles and many cosmetics can also be obtained on the market using ingame currency.\nPlenty of jobs (think quests) to do with dynamic missions and encounters thrown in. There is always something to do even if you're not looking for anything.\nIn case you hate finding a random group and ending up with undesirable people, you can solo almost everything (except for a few story based missions).\nPlayers can only exchange goods but no currency, so hopefully gold sellers might find this game less attractive.\nPlenty of add ons that make your life easier (check the add on forum on the Firefall site)\nCons:\nSluggish user interface and convoluted dialogs. Basically everything that is not related to moving and shooting seems to have been done by interns that just started there first lessons on user interface design and had a knack for eventually consistent databases. Oddly enough this is an area where the game has been redesigned a couple of times but never really improved.\nCurrently there is only Open World PvP, which is rather pointless as both casuals with green gear and hardcores with epic gear battle on the same instance. There used to be a skill based arena PvP with standardized gear but it was disabled quite a while ago and no schedule has been announced on when it will return. Either way, PvP is more about spaming your abilities than actually aiming and hitting or slowly building up proper team tactics.\nNo reasonable way to try an advanced battleframe before buying it. Sometimes there are weekends where you can try a single advanced frame for free. And there is a short period for new accounts where they can try out all frames (which sadly is at a time where you are already overwhelmed by figuring out the basic mechanics of the game).\nThe current endgame (at level 40) is mostly pointless grind, there isn't anything particullarly useful to do.\nThings you should be aware of:\nPlaying through the various areas is linear, content is gated by level. You can replay lower content though (e.g. to help your newbie friend), your battleframe automatically downgrades to a (somewhat) appropriate level.\nDistances between jobs can be quite large, which is annoying if you have no vehicle or recharable glider yet. You get a free LGV (think motorbike) when you reach level 25 with your first frame though. Be prepared to invest a little money to buy a vehicle early on.\nFrom the beginning you can use 5 different battleframes (think classes) which offer a lot of different play styles. Once you level a frame to 40, you can unlock one of 11 advanced frames. As a rough estimate, it takes about one hour to reach a new level.  Be prepared to invest a little money to buy your favourite battleframe early on.\nThere is no instance finder that automatically assigns you to a group, so you have to go and find other people using the /zone chat. (There is a rather limited /lfg command, but hardly anyone uses it, thus it's pointless in practice.)\nThe crafting and researching mechanic require a lot of grind to use them effectively. I tend to ignore this and get by using random drops. This makes the game more interesting as you have to compensate the lack of decent gear with skills.\nThere are still quite a few bittervets around that complain about what the game could have been and how they have been betrayed by investing early on. Just ignore them. Yes, it started out very ambitiously and ended up very traditionally. If you are looking for an innovative game, better play something else.","July 30, 2014","true","355.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

However this game seems pretty freak'n awsome...\n\nFirst off im really glad to see an mmo move in a fresh new direction, i'm also glad to see the shooter genre being worked with in a new light. These two very popular game catagories havent seemed to chage much at all since mmos like Guild Wars 2 and the more recent Tera Rising which unfortunatly lacks a little depth. Even less evoulution has come from FPS (first person shooters) and 3PS (third person shooters). I have yet to play Destiny so i cannot comment on how it may have changed the shooter genre, but i have played a wonderfull 3ps mmo called Global agenda and let me tell you, was that game fun. Global agneda died out quite awhile ago it seems, even with rumor for a remake. But from what i have experienced so far, Firefall gives a very similar feeling to Global Agenda.\n\nTo be honest i was first sceptical of the MMOFPS Firefall. The screen shots depicted bulky looking character models and an impression of just another delevoper failing to reimagine the mmo genre -I was wrong.\n\nIt started on a night like most, I was dwindling on steam browsing for a new mmo to play, because for some reason i just couldent get back into playing WoW. I decided, hey what have i got to lose by atleast trying this new game? ahhh but first let me check youtube. And wow nothing but beople complaining aobut things like the inability to pick up multiple quests and finish them all at once and even more so about how long the game took to get out of beta. Sifting through all the hate i realized that DIFFERENT is exactly what i was looking fore. I have come to absolutly love that i can only do one quest or "job" at a time in Firefall it makes the game feel more real and immersive for me. Each Job has new and unique fully voiced dialog with multiple characters and a suprisingly intricate story depth (per mission, or town set of missions). However there arent too many to do per town, city, station, or whatever you like to call it, this is totaly OK! because there are things happening all over the map, that in most cases can be joined at any time without the need to group or even started on your own to take on the challenge of soloing the game. Oh, and might i add all of these random occuring events are also fully voiced and do a good job at making you feel like you are a high tech, bad ♥♥♥ space cowboy.\n\nAll in all what i mean to say is i like the direction this game is going. Fire fall gives all the feelings of both an mmo and a console game, the artwork and graphics are beautifle while not needing immense power to support them, and the questing/ PVE of this MMOFPS  has kept me entertained more than any other MMORPG with the exeptions of GW2 and WoW wich i rarely play either of the two any more. As far as PVP goes i am reluctant to say i can not yet report, i can say however, i cant wait to hit lvl 40 and run off into that open world, no rules, anything goes pvp island i have heared about.\n\nP.S.\nCould someone please explain to me how this game is completely free? im entirely baffeld at how such a nice game requires no money to play. I understand Firefall uses a type of micropayment like LoL's methods, but LoL has a very lage user base buying things like skins and wards. Firefall doesent seem to have an extencive list of really cool stuff to buy.\n\n\n","December 9, 2014","true","92.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Standard gameplay largely consists of being tasked to go to a place, shoot at things, then go to other places to shoot at things until you return to the place you started.  Often these tasks consist of multiple jaunts of 400+ meters of travel and all this running quickly becomes dull even with the jetpack your character is supplied with (The jets are primarily for upward mobility rather than lateral movement).  While there do exist ways to expedite the time involved in travel by way of gliders and temporary vehicles (With, as I understand it, permanent vehicles available at level 25?  Apologies if I'm wrong in this regard as I was unable to keep motivated to play to that point).\n\nI personally experienced combat as the Engineer frame and was rather unimpressed with it overall.  The frame's primary weapon is a dual purpose beam weapon that can damage enemies or repair friendly structures, but I found myself having to expend 60% or more of my weapon's ammunition on targets on a fairly consistent basis in spite of receiving weapon upgrades at a fairly decent pace.  This was made more unfortunate by the fact that you can only carry a maximum of four full reloads for your primary weapon and this led to me mainly using my secondary weapon.  The engineer frame starts out with a shotgun as a secondary and I just found the weapon outright appalling.  I found that I had to pretty much be point blank and dead center on a target to deal a worthwhile amount of damage to any enemy.  Later I switched to using an SMG as a secondary weapon.  It had better accuracy at range but I quickly found myself having to reload its 65 round magazine multiple times to deal with enemies of equal level using an SMG that was of my level.  The saving grace to these secondary weapons is that your ammunition for them is infinite...but in practice they seem to be rather weak in utility.\n\nI can't speak for later game but the game rather quickly lost my interest early in, and if a game cannot hold interest through the early stages that speaks of a considerable flaw with it as a whole.  As it stands now I cannot recommend that you spend a considerable amount of time playing Firefall, though if you simply have some time to kill and space on your hard drive you could do far worse.\n\nIf nothing else, give the game a few months to get on its feet before making any real investments on it.","August 11, 2014","false","4.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Glitches that sometimes prevent you from advancing further in the mission, major graphical glitches and Pay 2 Win. The community can be helpful at times but it is extremely fanboyish, even if you point out a bug they instantly turn hostile\n\nCrafting is complex and a pain, by the time you get the needed supplies for a item you have researched (crafting is in 4 stages, collecting raw materials, Refining, Researching Then Manufacturing said item) you have already passed the level where it becomes useful.\n\nThe Marketplace is also overly complex and not helpful, there is no tutorial to help you for it and it goes something like this; To sell an item you need to create a sell order for said item so someone can pick the order up and purchase the item for credits (the player currency) or you could fill in a buy order where the person who wants to buy something puts in a order for someone selling to fill it (no one ever creates legitimate buy orders that is not spam like 500 of 1 item for 1 credit)\n\nThere is no fast way to travel early in game unless you want to spend some money IRL to buy a permenant vehicle so the only way you can travel without reaching level 25 (which takes roughly 30 hours of pure gameplay for a new player) or using 1 use, bad vehicles which you have a chance to get from slot machines is to buy one of the games packages for XX amount of 'Red Beans' which is a currency you buy with real money to purchase just about anything, even advanced versions of the default classes for 100 beans each, which of course, is a rip off.\n\nYou can convert Crystite (a material you get from refining, killing, doing missions etc etc but you use for crafting) into credits for 1:25 which is only useful to use in end game when you are making too much Crystite or have no use for it as you have researched everything you need. However there is a conversion max you can do each day (i believe it is 1000 however im not sure) and the same you can do for Red Beans however it is much more credits to convert for a single Red Bean.\n\nYou can buy 'pilots licenses' from the marketplace which gives you access to the advanced classes that you can purchase with credits however it costs roughly 2000 credits for a single license on average as they do fluctuate which adds up to roughly 50,000 Crystite!\n\nPlease note this review is not complete and I did not have sufficent time to complete it all in one sitting, I will add more to it in further detail at a later date","August 5, 2014","false","113.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Saw alot of changes, good and bad ones. But recently i decided to check on release and i was totally dissapointed. So, if you liked complex old crafting system and good rewarding thumping in pockets - then move along. Nothing for you there. So here's my impression and feedback.\n\n- Game became alot more friendly to new players, also alot more easier\n- Crafting got simplified as maximum as possible. You don't need to worry abough energy, weight and stats. You just craft pre-defined items every time.\n- Thumping now can be done blindfolded. Resource veins is a total mess - there is a huge lack of resource quantity. So thumping is a pain now really.\n- Battlframes. Have levels now - takes ages to grind. Gear got simplified as well. No more servos, jumpjets and platings. Just core and weapons. Also repair pools are gone and now gear is permanent and can't broke. You can repair it as much as you like. Right now you just grind the best gear and that's it.\nMissions. New field missions are just the same as ARES just another name. Slight imprivement tho - voiced dialogs and some kind of a story. Still boring.\n- Currency and Market. Biggest con for me. New currency been added - credits. Once per 24 hours you can exchange 25k CY for 1k credits. Now you need credits for everything. Prices are rediclous. White metal and purple metal costs the same. Very frustrating to use. Crystite became almost useless.\n\nAgain - just my opiniion and impressions as old player. Right now alot of things are broken\not working as intended\missing or w\e. Some changes are just weird\stupid. Honestly after i played for a bit i just feel that i don't have any desire to log in back. I know things most likely gonna change. I loved this game, really. And i don't want to bash it but this just plain redicilous.\nYou still feel free to try.","August 11, 2014","false","34.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Bring me back to what the word "Fun" means. Many modern titles try to push quest lines, and stuff like that. Firefall has a decent questline, but it isn't what truly brings me towards it. It's the sheer amount of random, silly, dumb, stupid, but amazing things you can do with your time. It's both entertaining as a system to work with, through jobs, events, and thumping. When I'm not doing that, I'm trying to explore, and climb the tallest structure near me. The best game in my opinion, is the game in which you are so unrestricted in your choices, that you can play your own games within the game.\n\nThe last game I've played that was this entertaining was Halo 3. Some people might look at me as if I were crazy for saying that, but Halo 3 in it's day, you didn't have to play the game as the game itself. Matchmaking was mediocre at best, and the storyline was short. But the Foundry, the Custom Games options, and the fact you and a couple of friends could do what you set your hearts out to on your own, made it worth every weekend night I spent making memories.\n\nFirefall gives me that precise feeling, all over again. It's a great game. I hope whoever reads this review will give it a try, and if they do, don't try to play it as though it were a conventional quest-driven MMO. It isn't. It's whatever you, and a couple of your buddies want to make it be.\n\n5/5","September 22, 2014","true","33.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/venoabyss/recommended/227700/","venoabyss","Voraga","http://steamcommunity.com/id/venoabyss/","172 products in account","I loved this game and I hate to add some perspective but I still see it listed as Mostly Positive on the reviews, it went from 90% positive to about 70% positive all with the release of 1.6. Don't let my 500ish hours on record fool you, I played back in closed beta and before it came out on steam my character had literally thousands of hours on it, I don't use the steam client anymore either because it seems to be more buggy than the stand alon release.\n\nShort Review:\nThe 1.6 patch made it so that new players were locked into a single frame (class) which in most MMO's wouldn't be an issue but Firefall was about freedom to swap classes at will. They changed almost every class from the 1.3 standards and weakened every stat on them. Crafting and high level zones (DT & Amazon) are currently suspended. Thumping doesn't yield resources but a small amount of crystite (in game currency). The new tinkering system requres credits which you can buy with red beans (real money exchange currency) and crystite (at 25k CY for 1k credits), originally credits were listed as the player to player purchase currency. PvP is back, but only one map and game type. Most vendors are broken in Sertao (30-40 zone now). Instances are broken into several types: Standard level and Challenge level seem to work fine. Hardcore (lvl 40) missions are 50/50 as to if it will launch for you. Hardcore Operations are buggy on launch and some times don't launch. Raid (yes singular) doesn't always launch and currently has a bug with the final phase so it's 50/50 if you'll be able to complete it. They took out 3 other raids: Baneclaw (expected to return in 1.7), Kanaloa (no return date yet) and Warfront (no return date yet). The Red Bean store went to rentals over purchases, thus you only get to rent the nice bikes then have to pay again next month. So in conclusion they took away most of what make Firefall Special, removed 70% of the content, and made it so if you do buy into thier game you get nothing in return.\n\nLong review:\n\nPro's:\nFree to play - if you don't buy beans\nAbility cooldowns are very short\n\nCon's:\nAll the frames feel similar\nvery little diversity in play styles\nfeels like every other shooter on the market with slightly better jumps\nno more ZipZaping the chosen, they are no longer confused by mid-air acrobatics\nCover is the only defense against chosen fire\nno crafting\nno thumping\nno new player frame switching\nbuggy quests (called jobs)\nHardcores rarely work right\nOperations rarely launch\nOnly one Raid, takes about 30 mins.\n\nI can't even play it anymore much less recomend it to new players. The game went from alot of fun to a pointless grind with real world money sinks. It feels like they are running out of money and trying to get the player base to pay for further development, the parent company The9 is ignoring player feedback and focusing on the Chinese Console release. From the direction the game has gone I would expect that the game will be shutting down in the US EU areas before long, players are leaving in hordes, the bad reviews are piling up, support tickets are getting stupid responces to bugs. IE they have 2 inventory tabs Inventory and Account Items. Account items are apparently character bound and character specific so account items not showing on all character on the account is "Working as Intended" which seems to be the responce to 90% of the strange bugs. the other responce is "We're working on a fix."\n\nUnderstand I waited a month hoping they would fix the bugs they introduced, no luck. After over 3 years of playing I'm leaving firefall at this time, no further red bean purchases, no futher PTR testing, I'm tired of the crap they keep pulling. Goodbye Firecat, Recluse and Bastion. The rest of the frames good riddens.","March 17","false","471.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

It has a jetback-and-plasma-cannon gameplay that's reminiscent of Starship Troopers Mobile Infantry (the novel!) Some have said it's also similar to global agenda.\n\nWhat's everyone missing? A long, long time ago Copacobana felt... alive. Y'know. Like a real place. There would be wildlife scurrying through the undergrowth, players everywhere. Even thermal updrafts that blew your gliders higher for more exploration. There was only one zone available for a while, which was smaller, granted - but much more seamless.\n\nThere's just less players now, which is a result of the mission system forcing less players per given shard. You also had no level-gating to keep you from joining friends whenever you wanted, and people helping each other was both more commonplace and more meaningful.\n\nI know that vertical progression brings in the money and is more financially viable. Yes, I know there's hardware limitations on how many events you can have. But it feels so ♥♥♥♥ing barren sometimes in the game. It doesn't help there's no real progression after level 40 on a frame except spamming missions for better loot.\n\nWhy am I sticking with Firefall? Well, despite the screw-ups in the past, I really like Red 5 as a studio. They listen, they patch fast, they've fostered a great community. They've also been working their asses off with new events to bring in new people. So hopefully it keeps getting better and more like the game we all loved before.","August 2, 2014","true","462.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The gameplay is intended to be fluid and fairly rapidly-paced.  The questing (other than campaign quests) is fairly 'lite' on the story and I enjoyed the possibility of 'leveling' the same character in different roles in a way that made sense.  Red 5s stance on cheating is delightfully straighforward.  There are plentiful simple semi-randomized quests with middling rewards.\n\nThe bad:  There were several quests I could not finish due to bugs.  There was a quest with a node in 'deep water' (think damage zones) which, once you used, you took damage until you died (which then teleported me two zones away to a different respawn point).  There were two quests that sat at "loading next waypoint" (or the equivalent, I forget the exact wording) the quest wouldn't progress, and relogging cleared the quest from your active quests.  Finally, as Acidule mentioned in his review, the tuning for enemy advancement is rather awkward.  You usually fight packs of 3-12 mooks at a time, and a large pack of equal-level ones will kill you.  I feel like if their net code was better, this would be less of an issue.  (I run off broadband with sub 15ms ping and 90/25 mb bandwidth so there is no shortage on my end).  A further point brought up in another review is the decidedly monetized feel for a lot of what I would consider fairly basic things.  Inventory isn't an issue at relatively low level (although with all the different crafting materiels I could see it becoming one) but purchasing more slots requires use of the cash currency.  As do most of the permanent travel options.  I wouldn't have expected the vehicles to be such a big issue, however there is *SO MUCH RUNNING* needed that I can only feel they are trying to perform the same "2nd-class citizen" action that has ruined the appeal of so many other F2P games.  There is a big difference between "freemium" games where you get either cosmetic or minor benefits and ones that feel 'gated' by the payment requirements.\n\nBottom line, if this game was still listed as being in beta, I could be much more forgiving of the flaws and bugs.  I may give it another shot in a few weeks or months to see if there are any improvements or fixes... Then again, with all the various MMOs and other F2P games to play, I might not.","August 9, 2014","false","12.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I just checked in to what is supposed to be the pvp area and I was literally the only person in the zone. The combat mechanics are mediocre at best, all the classes while different inappearance and abilities somehow manage to feel all too similiar. (possibly due to the lack of npc AI which for the most part just requires you to stand aim and shoot at the enemy to take them down, unless presented with a swarm then maybe you'll need some cover) Travelling is a pain as if you want to get anywhere quickly, in fact if you want to do just about anything outside the bounds of running around grinding in one of the boring basic classes you better be ready to shell out some cash. There are ways to implement free to play games and this game is on the very wrong side of the spectrum.

It went through a developer hell (you can research if you want to know) to arrive at its current state.\nYou are an ARES agent equpped with a battleframe. There are 5 classes of frames each with 2-3 advanced subclasses. Assault, Dreadnaught, Engineer, Recon & Biotech are the basic ones available right away. To unlock an advanced sub-class frame you need to level any already unlocked frame to 40. Alternatively, you can just buy a pilot license with cash or purchase one off the player market. The latter method involves a decent amount of grinding as in-game currency is harder to come by than usual.\nThe game game certainly has its charm - the colourful world, a few interesting personalities, fresh combat. But all of that is balanced out by the monotony of grind once the initial novelty passes, the somewhat boring crafting system and a rudimentary player economy.\nWhile the release version is quite OK there are some things that turned to worse since closed beta. The game's resource and crafting system went through many iterations, some more in-depth than the others. At present you can only boost any one base stat of your frame with mutually exclusive 'cores'. I see this as a huge step back as before you were able to boost most stats by crafting better battleframe components. Jumpjets allowed you to have a better, faster boost, plating gave you armour and health/regen, servos were responsible for run/sprint speed and jump height and so on.\nWeapon and other gear crafting has gone through some dramatic changes as well. As the game is right now, crafting anything except the highest tier gear is pointless as you'd have to grind for resources and, chances are, you'll sooner get an item drop comparable to the one you're looking to craft.\n\nIf you want a few hours of fun the game will deliver, but beyond that it turns into a grind-fest to get to end-game of which there is very little. Keep an eye out for future content updates. Hopefully, those will improve and expand Firefall.","July 30, 2014","true","96.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

It’s good for what it is, but it’s not my thing.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/BoenItmBfSA\nI didn’t really know anything about this game before today. So I wasn’t sure what to expect. When it said FPS MMO I thought maybe that would mean it’s sort of like Planetside. But it’s not like that, so far it feels like a cross between WOW and borderlands. Gameplay is primarily PVE. I’ve pretty much only played solo so far. I mainly found myself taking one quest, travelling to a location, killing a set number of hostile aliens, picking up an item and returning to the quest giver. Unfortunately for me after having played WOW and borderlands before it felt very ‘been there, done that’. Especially with having to travel by foot to objectives, why would I want simulate walking? But it still feels better than what I remember WOW being like which is the main MMORPG that I’ve played. I really wanted to just to get stuck into some team PVE instances or PVP matches. I did participate in what I think was a matchmade coop PVE instance. But I didn’t have a lot of time to look at that today which sucks, because it actually started to get interested once I reached that. There is supposed to be PVP as well but I didn’t have a chance to experience that today. After a little bit of research I found how you’re supposed to add yourself to the queue for that but it didn’t work for me. And I haven’t found any information about when you are able to do that. I can only assume that I need to progress further in order to unlock PVP matchmaking. One feature that I did like in this was the jetpack ability, that’s a cool if limited way to move around.\n\nInitially I felt that the graphics were actually below what I expected. I felt maybe the textures weren’t that detailed. I really got sense that the game is geared towards being able to support action on a large scale i.e. large scale battles with a large amount of players. But actually after playing it for a while I felt that the graphics aren’t bad at all. The cutscenes and dialogue in the beginning I didn’t really pay a lot of attention to because I really just wanted to get stuck into the game. So I can’t really say much about the lore and the story\n\nWhat are you getting with this game. It’s sort of a Borderlands like experience that costs nothing. If you really like MMORPG games this might be right for you. At this stage I don’t know how restricted you are in the long run as non-paying player. But hopefully you are not put at an extreme disadvantage if you don’t invest money into the game. I would have liked to have just been able to engage in PVP combat right from start. If I get around to it I want to do more on PVE instances and PVP matches in this game hopefully do a let’s play on it/add more to my review. That’s all I have to say about this game for today.\n\nClick here for my YouTube gaming channel","July 29, 2014","true","5.0"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

For some reason it is filled with more bugs than the client from the actual website.\n\nFirefall wise, this game is pretty awesome. I feel bad for the new players though because you only get to choose one battleframe and you can't change unless you pay money or get it to level 40.  In the beta you started out with all the accord frames and had to unlock the others.\n\nGameplay wise it is fun, you can switch between first person and third person, glide around, grind resources, quest, craft, get pets, and play different classes. The crafting system is intense and requires you to "thump" for resources.\n\nThumping is basically an auto mine feature where you guard the thumping device from constant waves of enemies that get harder and harder the longer you "thump" or mine for resources. This is what you will be doing for a really big portion of the game. The only downside to this is that it can get really redundant and boring. Just take a break and do something else and go back to it!\n\nYou can also join other players in thumping and recieve a portion of the resources they are thumping. The bigger the thumper the harder it will be to defend it. It doesn't take away from what the owner of the thumper recieves so dont be afraid to hop in and help. Free xp and resources! Can't complain.\n\nThe red beans are the cash shop of the game. Pretty well balanced in my opinion, I think the battleframes are a little pricey at around 15 dollars per frame. Each frame cost 100 beans (or get a frame to level 40). 50 bucks will get you 4 frames (450 red beans) because you get bonus beans for buying in bulk so obviously the more beans you buy the cheaper the frame.  If thats all you buy then basically you have bought yourself a game anyways so do your research and pick 4 frames to love. Or just get frames to level 40 and unlock them yourself.\n\nAll in all it is fully free to play, no pay to win, fun, and DON'T GET THE STEAM CLIENT!

I've heard a lot of criticism about it, and frankly, I don't see it. Here are some of the major problems people have with the game.\n\n1. Transportation is only available after level 25 - While true, what you have to realise is that that is level 25 on one class. There are a total of 16 classes, meaning that level 25 is relatively early in the game. In addition, I've only been playing Firefall for 36 hours, at this point, and I have leveled one class to level 23, another to 15, and the other three basic ones to 6/7. So, it doesn't actually take that long to progress anyway.\n\n2. Pay to win - This is absolutely not true. Because of the way the currency system works, you can convert in-game currency to Red Beans, which is the paid-for currency. Therefore, it is possible to earn any item you want just by playing the game. Yes, it will take time and effort, but the alternative is for everything to simply be given to the player, negating all semblance of progression. Not to mention the fact that most of the things that you buy with Red Beans are vanity items anyway.\n\n3. No variations on weapons - I put this claim down to people not playing the game long enough. While yes, each class has only one type of weapon that they can use, they do vary somewhat. For example, the Assault's weapon is a plasma cannon, with an alt-fire of a shotgun-style blast. Around level 18 or so, I found blueprints for a version that spits fire instead - it keeps the feel of the Assault's weapon, but with a slightly different twist. In addition, I am now level 23 on the Assault, and I haven't found a replacement, so it's definitely paid off.\n\n4. No variation on abilities - This is basically the same problem as the above, but I didn't want to write too much in one section. I've heard some people complain that at level 8 (when you unlock your 4th ability), you don't get anything new. This is far from the case. You unlock new abilities at level 15 and 23, which means that you will need to switch out abilities and try new things. The amount of levelling between these abilities is such that it gives you a chance to try the new abilities and playstyles, without letting the game stagnate too much.\n\nThese are the 4 things I've found to be the most common 'downsides' to the game, and personally, I don't think they stand up. My belief is that people who complain about this game do not understand what the game is about. Firefall is *not* a normal FPS. It is a MMO, first and foremost, which is why I do not understand why people complaining about having to work for their rewards. I do not claim to know everything about MMOs, but Firefall doesn't feel particularly grindy to me. Personally, I think people judge Firefall as an FPS first, when it is an MMO. The majority of people that I have seen bad reviews from have judged the game around level 8-12, without giving the game a chance to show it's diversity.\n\nObviously, this game will not be everyone's favourite, but it is for me. Also, for people who say that the game has become worse since beta, I played this game during beta, and it was too complicated for my taste. Firefall is currently in a much more enjoyable state.","September 5, 2014","true","365.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

It’s good for what it is, but it’s not my thing.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/BoenItmBfSA\nI didn’t really know anything about this game before today. So I wasn’t sure what to expect. When it said FPS MMO I thought maybe that would mean it’s sort of like Planetside. But it’s not like that, so far it feels like a cross between WOW and borderlands. Gameplay is primarily PVE. I’ve pretty much only played solo so far. I mainly found myself taking one quest, travelling to a location, killing a set number of hostile aliens, picking up an item and returning to the quest giver. Unfortunately for me after having played WOW and borderlands before it felt very ‘been there, done that’. Especially with having to travel by foot to objectives, why would I want simulate walking? But it still feels better than what I remember WOW being like which is the main MMORPG that I’ve played. I really wanted to just to get stuck into some team PVE instances or PVP matches. I did participate in what I think was a matchmade coop PVE instance. But I didn’t have a lot of time to look at that today which sucks, because it actually started to get interested once I reached that. There is supposed to be PVP as well but I didn’t have a chance to experience that today. After a little bit of research I found how you’re supposed to add yourself to the queue for that but it didn’t work for me. And I haven’t found any information about when you are able to do that. I can only assume that I need to progress further in order to unlock PVP matchmaking. One feature that I did like in this was the jetpack ability, that’s a cool if limited way to move around.\n\nInitially I felt that the graphics were actually below what I expected. I felt maybe the textures weren’t that detailed. I really got sense that the game is geared towards being able to support action on a large scale i.e. large scale battles with a large amount of players. But actually after playing it for a while I felt that the graphics aren’t bad at all. The cutscenes and dialogue in the beginning I didn’t really pay a lot of attention to because I really just wanted to get stuck into the game. So I can’t really say much about the lore and the story\n\nWhat are you getting with this game. It’s sort of a Borderlands like experience that costs nothing. If you really like MMORPG games this might be right for you. At this stage I don’t know how restricted you are in the long run as non-paying player. But hopefully you are not put at an extreme disadvantage if you don’t invest money into the game. I would have liked to have just been able to engage in PVP combat right from start. If I get around to it I want to do more on PVE instances and PVP matches in this game hopefully do a let’s play on it/add more to my review. That’s all I have to say about this game for today.\n\nClick here for my YouTube gaming channel","July 29, 2014","true","5.0"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

For some reason it is filled with more bugs than the client from the actual website.\n\nFirefall wise, this game is pretty awesome. I feel bad for the new players though because you only get to choose one battleframe and you can't change unless you pay money or get it to level 40.  In the beta you started out with all the accord frames and had to unlock the others.\n\nGameplay wise it is fun, you can switch between first person and third person, glide around, grind resources, quest, craft, get pets, and play different classes. The crafting system is intense and requires you to "thump" for resources.\n\nThumping is basically an auto mine feature where you guard the thumping device from constant waves of enemies that get harder and harder the longer you "thump" or mine for resources. This is what you will be doing for a really big portion of the game. The only downside to this is that it can get really redundant and boring. Just take a break and do something else and go back to it!\n\nYou can also join other players in thumping and recieve a portion of the resources they are thumping. The bigger the thumper the harder it will be to defend it. It doesn't take away from what the owner of the thumper recieves so dont be afraid to hop in and help. Free xp and resources! Can't complain.\n\nThe red beans are the cash shop of the game. Pretty well balanced in my opinion, I think the battleframes are a little pricey at around 15 dollars per frame. Each frame cost 100 beans (or get a frame to level 40). 50 bucks will get you 4 frames (450 red beans) because you get bonus beans for buying in bulk so obviously the more beans you buy the cheaper the frame.  If thats all you buy then basically you have bought yourself a game anyways so do your research and pick 4 frames to love. Or just get frames to level 40 and unlock them yourself.\n\nAll in all it is fully free to play, no pay to win, fun, and DON'T GET THE STEAM CLIENT!

I've heard a lot of criticism about it, and frankly, I don't see it. Here are some of the major problems people have with the game.\n\n1. Transportation is only available after level 25 - While true, what you have to realise is that that is level 25 on one class. There are a total of 16 classes, meaning that level 25 is relatively early in the game. In addition, I've only been playing Firefall for 36 hours, at this point, and I have leveled one class to level 23, another to 15, and the other three basic ones to 6/7. So, it doesn't actually take that long to progress anyway.\n\n2. Pay to win - This is absolutely not true. Because of the way the currency system works, you can convert in-game currency to Red Beans, which is the paid-for currency. Therefore, it is possible to earn any item you want just by playing the game. Yes, it will take time and effort, but the alternative is for everything to simply be given to the player, negating all semblance of progression. Not to mention the fact that most of the things that you buy with Red Beans are vanity items anyway.\n\n3. No variations on weapons - I put this claim down to people not playing the game long enough. While yes, each class has only one type of weapon that they can use, they do vary somewhat. For example, the Assault's weapon is a plasma cannon, with an alt-fire of a shotgun-style blast. Around level 18 or so, I found blueprints for a version that spits fire instead - it keeps the feel of the Assault's weapon, but with a slightly different twist. In addition, I am now level 23 on the Assault, and I haven't found a replacement, so it's definitely paid off.\n\n4. No variation on abilities - This is basically the same problem as the above, but I didn't want to write too much in one section. I've heard some people complain that at level 8 (when you unlock your 4th ability), you don't get anything new. This is far from the case. You unlock new abilities at level 15 and 23, which means that you will need to switch out abilities and try new things. The amount of levelling between these abilities is such that it gives you a chance to try the new abilities and playstyles, without letting the game stagnate too much.\n\nThese are the 4 things I've found to be the most common 'downsides' to the game, and personally, I don't think they stand up. My belief is that people who complain about this game do not understand what the game is about. Firefall is *not* a normal FPS. It is a MMO, first and foremost, which is why I do not understand why people complaining about having to work for their rewards. I do not claim to know everything about MMOs, but Firefall doesn't feel particularly grindy to me. Personally, I think people judge Firefall as an FPS first, when it is an MMO. The majority of people that I have seen bad reviews from have judged the game around level 8-12, without giving the game a chance to show it's diversity.\n\nObviously, this game will not be everyone's favourite, but it is for me. Also, for people who say that the game has become worse since beta, I played this game during beta, and it was too complicated for my taste. Firefall is currently in a much more enjoyable state.","September 5, 2014","true","365.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

In order to unlock missions (that's basically the story of the game) you have to reach a certain level, and in order to level up you of course need xp, and the only way to get it is either a couple of side events, jobs or thumping, and that's it. The jobs get extremely repetitive, it always sends you LONG distances to the waypoint, and once you reach the waypoint there's little to no things to do, you either kill things, defend something by killing waves of things or it's an escort mission where you have to travel a whole kilometer and defend the person you're escorting to a certain waypoint by killing things. And there is little enemy variety. Once you're done with 1 objective you get another, take a guess what you need to do in the next objective... That's right! Kill things that are miles away. Once you reach level 25 you get a LGV ( motorbike ) recipe which helps you get to places faster, but that doesn't solve the problem that for EVERY SINGLE JOB you need to kill things AND NOTHING ELSE. In the game there are about 4-5 classes and each class branches about in about 2-3 different styles of the class, for example you have the basic Recon class with a mid-long range assault rifle, and the class branches out to a recon class with a long range bolt action rifle ( Nighthawk ) but in order to unlock a different class apart from the basics you need to max out any class to level 40 which as you may have guessed already, takes a craplot of grinding\n\nMy final verdict for the game would be 4/10","August 11, 2014","false","41.1"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

In order to unlock missions (that's basically the story of the game) you have to reach a certain level, and in order to level up you of course need xp, and the only way to get it is either a couple of side events, jobs or thumping, and that's it. The jobs get extremely repetitive, it always sends you LONG distances to the waypoint, and once you reach the waypoint there's little to no things to do, you either kill things, defend something by killing waves of things or it's an escort mission where you have to travel a whole kilometer and defend the person you're escorting to a certain waypoint by killing things. And there is little enemy variety. Once you're done with 1 objective you get another, take a guess what you need to do in the next objective... That's right! Kill things that are miles away. Once you reach level 25 you get a LGV ( motorbike ) recipe which helps you get to places faster, but that doesn't solve the problem that for EVERY SINGLE JOB you need to kill things AND NOTHING ELSE. In the game there are about 4-5 classes and each class branches about in about 2-3 different styles of the class, for example you have the basic Recon class with a mid-long range assault rifle, and the class branches out to a recon class with a long range bolt action rifle ( Nighthawk ) but in order to unlock a different class apart from the basics you need to max out any class to level 40 which as you may have guessed already, takes a craplot of grinding\n\nMy final verdict for the game would be 4/10","August 11, 2014","false","41.1"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

They already completely reworked their core mechanics once without much success.

The only thing limiting you to seeing more of this world is the giant purple wall of melding.  Back in beta this melding is what controlled server populations as well as explorable game world. It'd slowly creep closer and closer if players couldnt hold back the hordes of chosen, and then that server instance would eventually die to the melding.\n\nThis was the game i was introduced to. this beautiful world to explore and see and ignore all the player gameplay because "hey its still beta they are still tweaking things, who cares if voice acting and model animations are incredibly robotic, combat is repatative unless you play assault, range means nothing when quests have scripted ambushes so theres no real reason to play the recon advanced classes.  engineer classes have this weird dinner plate thing with lack luster weapon models and lack luster weapons that could easily just be tertiary weapons.  I dont even use the Tesla, i have my engineers using two secondary weapons (an assault rifle and the RPG) because the tesla is just flat out lame.  Maybe if it had a cone of effect or somthing that didnt just make it a shiny looking assault rifle.  But again, tangents.\n\nAll these tangents are the built up frustrations of one player,  Red 5 has kept looking at the big stuff, new maps, new monsters. but they have constantly overlooked the little details that really flush out a game.  the bones are there but it has no muscle.  Combat in general is pretty boring unless you are fighting random mobs out in the world, because then you can use your own combat playstyle to the best of your ability (but assault is pretty much the best combat experience in the game currently), Game models are great looking normally, but some animations are just...unnatural.  quests are still served best cold and alone, with no one acknoledging them.  then theres the fortress system, it wouldve been somthing like Wildstar's, but we don't know if they even remember talking about it.\n\nbasically, we are all waiting for a bigger company to buy the game and use it as a quick cash bull, maybe revitalise the game world as we grit our teeth through never ending grind of producer run gaming industry.","May 13","false","109.4"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

Are you helping a mother find her son? Are you helping some civilans getting food?\nThe game atleast says what you're doing and that can instantaniously makes you care. And the voice acted bits aren't shoved down your throat like in The old Republic, they are just some messages that you recive and they dont hinder your gameplay.\nBut unlike in the old Republic, your character is silent and doesn't talk at all (they do even joke about it).\n\nBut let us talk more about the combat. As i said, the game feels more of a co-op game, and even in combat that is clearly visible. Your main source of dispercing damage is your GUN! That means that combat is more Borderlands-esk and even the enemy variety is closely similar to that of Borderlands. But you also have 4 abilities, 3 that you use and have a cool down and the forth ability charges through combat.\n\nBut besides your regular missions Firefall is also structured to have a more dynamic feel to it. You will find your fellow players gathering resources and some side-mission, which you can ither start yourself or help your fellow soldiers in the field.\nThe gathering of the resources is especialy fun, since it is more of a team oriented thing and you and your friends are besacly just mowing down bugs and enemys as they come coming towards you.\n\nThere is also a crafting sistem, which works like your usuall crafting sistem with some twists (i have never seen a lot of the crafting sistems in other MMOs). Firstly you need to research what you want to make, and then actualy make it. Fearly basic, but the hard part is actualy juggeling your resources/money.\n\nI have mixed feeling on the business model. The devs sure need to make money and i belive they might have actualy been able to get a functioning sistem into their game that is not really pay to win. In game, you can buy red bean coins with real money, that in turn allow you to buy special items from the Red Bean store. Most of these items are luxurious, like a bike (you can make one yourself for free to) and some other cosmetic items. The only problem i have is that the giant gameplay changing item, the one that allows you to play different classes (battleframes) is (for me) kinda costly, since you can pay 10€ just for another run in the game with some different abilities.\nBut its not as bad as it sounds right now. You can actualy earn those Red Bean coins ingame, for free! You can excange your basic money, to credits (which are used for the marketplace) and then those into Red Bean coins. Sure the excange isn't exactly linear, but you can earn the Bean coins without spendint a dime.\nHow ever, the time it takes you to aquire even an usable amount of Bean coins, so it is still very harsh, but hey, you can speed things up with spending money and supporting the devs.\n\n\nIn short, Firefall is in my opinion one of the finest MMOs and if you liked Borderlands, Planetside 2 or Global Agenda, you should give this one a look. The begining few levels might be boring, but after you get into the game a bit it just takes off and unlike some MMOs that have you just spaming some abilities you can actualy have tons of fun here!","August 11, 2014","true","244.6"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

Missions stopped updating in my mission journal, one stuck at loading next waypoint, the tutorial mission bugged out and remain in my journal with the last objective even though I completed it the day before.\n\nThe server was very laggy, at the last login it was continually beeping with a server lag warning and other players were getting this same message.

Allow me to explain.\n\nThere's this other game, called Defiance (launched April 2, 2013). It's essentially the same game. Now, since Firefall was launched July 29, 2014, you'd think it would be better... well, it's not, it's... just different.\n\nSimilarities:\nBoth third person MMORPGs\n"Something" happened that made the Earth as we know it.\nThis "something" transmutated the fauna / flora.\nThere are different classes for your character.\nYou can level up your character.\nThere is a tech tree.\nThere are weapon mods.\nYou can upgrade your characters personal equipment.\nThere are bugs. Why always bugs. Anyway, think 'bug like extra-terrestrial animals'.\nThere are multiple areas, as per any MMORPG\nThere are quests - again MMORPG.\nYou play an alignment where the locals don't take too kindly to you. But you earn their respect by not being a turd, and helping them.\nThere's a local presence by the world wide millitary, then don't like you much either\n... look you get the idea.\n\nDifferences:\nIn Firefall, you're an ARES pilot - in Defiance, you're an ARK Hunter.\nIn Firefall, there's the option of being an Engineer. (yay!) You can place turrets etc.\nIn Firefall, If you get in too much water, you fritz out your power armor. <insert no swimming sign here>\nUmmmm.

Either studio that made Firefall or the game as an entity was purchased, and the update of doom was pushed out, prior to being ready.\n\nI don't think I'll be revisiting this game, as I would like to remember it as it was, and not as what I'm seeing represented in the reviews / on the internet.","February 5","false","23.8"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","8","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stanleypain2/recommended/227700/","stanleypain2","StanleyPain","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stanleypain2/","123 products in account","UPDATE:  Skip to the end for impressions on the new War in the Amazon content and faction changes.\n\nI'm coming up on 400 hours of gameplay in this fellow, so I suppose I should write a review of some sort.   Much has already been written about Firefall, and while I recommend the game to anyone looking for an action MMO, I almost feel like anything I say would hardly encapsulate the game because it is always changing and shifting (with a major endgame area to be debuted in the next few weeks after I write this).\n\nI suppose what most people want to know when reading user comments on this game is: is it actually free to  play or is it "Freemium" nonsense where the game is basically unplayable past a certain point without investing lots of money?  Well, I can definitely attest: this game really and truly is free to play.  There is no content behind paywalls and while real money can, in theory, buy you better in-game equipment and such, everything in the game can be obtained, in some manner, through gameplay.   Now, I won't lie....paying for the VIP membership is probably the smart course for a player who enjoys the game, but the game is not unplayable without it.  People who spend lots of real money for in-game currency to buy stuff off the player market will have an advantage in PvP, I won't lie, but as PvP is an entirely seperate part of the game, the PvE kinda benefits from having some people with purchased items.\nHaving said all that, here's my brief pros/cons rundown:\n\nPros:\n-Interesting variations in gameplay and playstyle based on the class you choose.\n-The perk system allows interesting synergies between different classes since the different classes can actually share most of the perks that you earn from leveling.\n-The game only uses ONE character who has access to all of the class "Frames", which makes sharing equipment easier and helps with leveling frames that are around the same level.\n-The singleplayer "jobs" actually bother to try telling a coherent story about the setting and background of the game.\n-A healthy amount of open world content that gives players a break from just doing jobs to level their frames.\n-Once you complete major milestones in the game once (like unlocking new areas etc.) the stuff unlocks for your successive frames, so you have more freedom and options with your lower level frames as you get further into the game.\n-Large-scale open world events allow for fun, co-op play with other players without being too exclusionary for lower level or newer players (although there are some basic level limits on certain things).\n-The ability to "thump" (mine for your own crafting resources) adds an interesting, self-initiated activity to the game.\n-Players share exp and loot for open world events in a very fair manner and no one player can either take all the rewards or prevent other players from getting their rewards either.\n\nCons:\n-The game balance, in terms of overall difficulty, is problematic at times and is always being tinkered with.  (as I write this, major updates to how combat functions are being planned probably to be implimented in the next month or two)\n-A fairly good chunk of the usual bugs and glitches that large, open world MMOs have.  Some are generally fixed fairly fast, while others have been around for ages without hope of being fixed any time soon.\n-Getting around the world can be awkward and slow even with vehicles and gliders and other assistance.  One entire section of the game (Sertao, the world for characters lvl 25-35) has no means of quick travel at all except to go back to the exit/entrance travel points.\n-The "advanced" frames are sometimes very superior to the normal, free, counterparts, making the base frames a little on the weak or disadvantaged side.\n-The major server events do not happen with anywhere near enough frequency, in my opinion.  All major events at this point only occur once an hour which can sometimes make areas of the game very barren of content depending on the time of day.\n-Special open world content rated for single players is not even remotely able to be finished by solo players, and often requires several people.\n-The in-game crafting system, while very useful and functional for character up to about level 30-32 becomes so insanely grindy and impractical in the later game that there is almost no point in using it to supply characters above lvl 32 or so.\n-Some of the instances and special missions have serious issues with what kind of loot they reward.  This is slowly being improved, but right now it is often not worth the time it takes to do some of the more advanced, end-game instances and such.\n\nLike any MMO, there are players who take a lot of things about this way too seriously and will often have a negative effect on the overall community, but anyone who just wants to have fun taking out some bad guys and maybe joining some large-scale events will find a lot to like here.  Just be aware that a lot of content and features have been added to the game over a relatively short period of time, so things are always being tweaked and modified.  The community, in general, has been very positive and the strong focus on PvE means that most players understand the benefits of helping out each other.\nIf, however, you are looking for PvP, Firefall might not satisfy you much.  While the game has an entire world set aside for PvP, it suffers from a few major problems; mostly balance and the fact that not many people play in those areas.  PvP will probably undergo major changes as well in the coming months, but right now I cannot reccomend Firefall for people who want the PvP aspect as a strong element of the game.\n\nDamn...it's almost impossible to really get into everything in this game except to say: just give it a try for a bit and see what you think.  The community is usually pretty helpful and I always try my best to help out newer players.  There is also a strong "mentor" system in the game where players get appointed as mentors.  A few of the mentors are jerks, but they get weeded out pretty fast.\n\nOh, and one more thing...the game is very playable with an Xbox controller (support for which is built-in) but you will have to fiddle with it to get it where you want it.  There are a lot of hot keys in the game and it's not possible to operate the entire game witn a controller, but the bulk of the game (running around and shooting things) can be done very well with a controller.\n\nUPDATED STUFF:  So, not long after I wrote this, Red 5 did indeed add the "War in the Amazon" content and a new faction system, which changes some aspects of my review.\n\nThe Amazon is a new region of the game geared solely towards high-level, end-game characters (the game says it's only for level 40 players, but I think level 37+ could probably handle themselves OK)  It's difficult to describe the region if you are not already familiar with the game, but to summarize it, it's basically just a place for lvl 40 characters to go nuts because there's nearly constantly combat.  It's a lot of fun, but as usual, one of the downsides is that the rewards are not that great and you need a lot of people to take over the region.   The new faction system is amazing and gets rid of so much of the grind.  Instead of having to slowly earn faction currency to buy things, you now just permanently earn reputation and can buy things with crystite (which is the standard currency) when you reach the appropriate faction level.  No more spending days of your life just trying to buy some high level abilities or weapons.","January 22, 2015","true","403.8"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","9","16","2","0"

Unlike most F2Ps, it doesn't act like a Pay to Win, rather Pay for convenience and cosmetics. It has an excellent crafting system, but it takes a while for the items to be completed. You can, however, pay 1 Red Bean, which is the game's paid currency, to instantly complete the crafting process. You aren't required to pay for Red Beans, however. With using the game's common currency, Crystite, you can obtain Credits, and convert those credits into Red Beans. You can obtain nearly everything in this game without spending anything, which I would like to see in more games. I didn't think this game would've changed much from the Beta, but it turns out that this game finally made it's way out of development hell. Replayable missions, great combat mechanics, fun dynamic events, good loot system, beautiful open-world, this game is really good and I think people should at least try it as it is Free to Play.","July 31, 2014","true","129.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you enjoyed Tabula Rasa back in the day, or you've played Global Agenda more recently, but wish they'd had a larger PvE zone, then you really owe it to yourself to give Firefall a try.  You should find each of the Firefall battleframes very familiar.\n\nFirefall continues to be actively developed, and the developers are not afraid to try new things, keeping what works and modifying or retiring what doesn't.  The developers are also quite responsive to player feedback.  Don't expect every pet feature to be magically implemented, but quality of life improvements do get added and bugs do get fixed.  Many of the improvements implemented over the years have been the direct result of player feedback.  (So be sure to report any bugs you find using the “Submit Bug Report” button or by opening a ticket at support.firefall.com.  And be sure to submit feature requests on feedback.firefallthegame.com Don't just gripe on general chat.)\n\nThat does also mean that as the game continues to evolve, the older reviews you read about Firefall become increasingly outdated.  Those who played only at various points during the beta experienced an entirely different game than the one that is currently offered.  (I know.  I was there.)  Even those who played shortly after launch missed out on such quality of life improvements as the 1-hour daily XP/resource buff, daily login rewards, the level 15 and level 25 LGV (aka – motorbike) quest rewards, as well as the 10% permanent XP buff you earn for each battleframe you level to 40.  (Which makes the game fairly altaholic friendly.)  They'd also be missing out on the new world events like Brontodon King, OCT, and Skydock that are regular staples now, and are generally a lot of fun to participate in.\n\nAs I write this the 1.3 update was just released a couple days ago, adding a large new open-world endgame zone, War in the Amazon.  Vouchers from the job-boards have been replaced with a more player-friendly reputation system.  And blueprints for building your own LGV are now available at the start of the game.  The core game engine continues to be improved as well, most recently adding a new adaptive particle effects scaling feature that helps keep the frame rate up during large scale firefights.\n\nIn short, if you like the idea of a cooperative action MMORPG with lots of guns an explosions, Firefall is definitely worth a try.\n\n\nSome advice for new players:\n\nIf you're motion sensitive, you may want to adjust the 1st and 3rd person FOV (field of view) sliders, the 3rd person camera zoom, 3rd person sprint zoom, and the camera animation check-box under options, gameplay, on the opening screen.  (I have my 3rd person FOV set to 110 with the camera and sprint zoom set at zero, and the camera animation turned off.)\n\nIf you're playing on an older computer and getting poor performance, try setting the shadow quality and model quality to LOW under options, graphics, advanced, on the opening screen.  Those two settings can give quite a performance boost for very little loss in video quality.  (If you're still getting poor performance, try lowering the texture resolution to medium or low as well.)\n\nAs soon as you have the materials collected, consider crafting yourself a stack of small stim packs, glider pads, and jump pads.  I usually keep those three things bound to my 6, 7, and 8 keys.  Using them along with the LGV, you'll be able to get around a lot easier and last a lot longer.  (Also note that you can earn a permanent glider pad by visiting every SIN tower in the game.)","February 13, 2015","true","906.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are great things about it. You can have multiple classes and switch at any civilized area. You have the jump packs, and the Gliders which allow for long distance "flying".

Or you devote hours are quests and convert what you get into Red Beans (VIP currency). I wouldn't recommend doing that though, my friend spent several hours trying to get enough stuff and only got 28 Red Beans which is practically nothing.\n\nThere are issues I have with it. There's VERY little campaign, as in you get a campaign mission every few levels. The missions are pretty straight forward, you go somewhere, shoot some people, and then go back to where you started. I also believe the game was supposed to be originally PvP, but I've only seen that in some much higher level areas. Which brings up another problem: the maps, while very large, are few.

If you haven't played it yet, I suggest you give it a shot - it's FREE!!\nWithout getting too philosophical, I've noticed there are primarily two kinds of people that play this game...\n\nType 1: The realist. This person realizes the game occassionally has issues like any other MMO and they don't expect it to be perfect. This player knows that MMOs get repetitive and doesn't complain about it. This player knows that even though they like the game, they know it's not for everyone. I consider myself to be in this category. I like the game for what it is and don't whine about the game not always being "100% SuPeR AwEsOmE!!!!!". I know the game has some bugs now and then - all games do. Type 1 players diligently submit bug reports to the developers (who have always been very kind and helpful!!!) and focus their time on areas of the game not affected by the bug until it is fixed.\n\nType 2: The idealist. This person believes all games should be totally perfect and never have problems - not even little ones. They think that if they don't personally like the game, the game must be crap and undeserving of anyone's attention - ever. People that play this game for 100, 200, even 300+ hours then leave a review about it being "too repetive, not all that fun, or too broken to play" are in this group. The idealist thinks that a game should be equally engaging at hour 1, hour 50, and hour 250. How painful it must be for them to be smacked upside the head by the cold hard paddle of reality. So painful in fact, that the only way they can make themselves feel better is to try and deprive others of 200+ hours of enjoyment by leaving bad reviews or complaining in the chat window.\n\nSo... if you're expecting Firefall to be as exciting as sex for an entire 1,000 hours of gameplay --> just move along and touch yourself to other things the internet has to offer.\nHowever... if you just want to play a fun MMO, with friendly people, set in a unique universe, for some undetermined amount of time --> start downloading this game NOW!!","April 17, 2015","true","118.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I think the system for crafting is very adaptive and balanced considering the amount of advantage to be gained from a crafted weapon.\n\nThe only complaint i have is that you have to get a frame to a max level before unlockign the next frame, this will force someone to play for months on a frame they dont like before getting the one they like. I hear rumur they will be fixing this and i hope its true.

Otherwise I would have wasted some good money.\n\nOkay, so it's TRIED to be individual, and to "fix" things that are wrong with MMOs. Well, trying is fine in alpha and such, but now? It just doesn't cut it.\n\nUpon first entering the game, you enter a tutorial to teach you about the game's basics. That's all well and good, and tutorials aren't meant to be absolutely amazing and show the game at its best, but they should show you a taster of the game and encourage you to indulge more time into it. However, this isn't the case. Graphics are poor, textures are just splotchy and undefined. This is slightly less on your gun, but even so, the background and scenery is not fantastic. Looking past this, I endevour to listen to the awkward narration informing me about the classes. Slightly generic classes, yet they look fun to play, especially the one called "Assault" where you have a rifle and jetpack-thing. The jetpack proved to be the only fun part.\n\nYou're thrown into some shooting and you need to defend certain locations from enemies, which is standard for tutorial, and I accepted it. So I was shooting away, along with various other people, and the first thing I noticed was that there was no satisfaction for me. I was shooting these aliens or whatever, and they gave no response. The only thing you notice is their helath dereasing, but then you're not sure whether it's you doing that, or other players. There's no change when shot, they just keep coming at you until they're dead. Now that's a fantastic part of all shooters, the satisfaction of eliminating your targets in the game, and receiving a reaction, whereas you may not be able to do the same thing "irl".\n\nSo this, along with other reasons, discouraged me and drained the fun out of the experience. The tutorial kind of sucked. Which made me not want to play any more of the game. Well I tried to play more, but upon finishing the tutorial and loading up the next mission, the game crashed and shut down. Zero motivation to load it up again, zero motivation to play it again.\n\nTry it, as it's free and might be your cup of tea, but I wasnt satisfied with FireFall.","July 31, 2014","false","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I was wrong.\n\nFIREFALL was unique game. One of its own kind,free2play,with massive map,nice animations,graphics,possibilities and PvP............and its most unique and iconic feature: Thumping.\nIt was a great game,before the Red5 did not did the stupid things.\nUpdating made the game worse.\nI was a closed beta player,and i can tell you all,that Firefall was AWESOME game.\n"Updates" are meant to make the game better.\nHowever,Red5 studios were fools. They ruined it. Some players can still see the hope,that i lost few months ago.\nRed5 are NOT a good game developers. They are like HiRez Studios...some of you may know them for their most "Famous" MOBA,the Smite. However,do you know what they did to their previous 2 games?\nGlobal Agenda and Tribes: Ascend?\nThey abandoned GA,stopped updating it,same with Tribes:Ascend.\nHow do i put it,well,Red5 does update the game-> 1MB/year maybe,unlike HiRez.\nRed5 made mistakes in past,that cannot be fixed. This game was once so great,i would play it since morning till late night,sleep few hours,wake up and then gamble again.\nWell,i was blinded,i thought it has a bright future,but it has not.\nI know about one thing that could save this game...Steam Workshop. I know,that other players can contribute making games so amazing. Take Killing Floor for example: You can make maps,weapons,other stuff,and others can play with it.\nWhy not implement this feature into Firefall too?\n\nOriginally posted by The Kodiak: "Heroes" who thought they were somehow unique. But this is a lie. You are all the same - Roaches that we must crush beneath our heels.\nGreat quote on Red5,written by themselves. They made unique game,but then...its no longer unique. Its now like any other average mmorpg.\n\nBUT HONESTLY,the game is not bad if you play it first time,its a really great experience for first time...but once you play it long-you will find out.\nI cannot deny,that i have really enjoyed this game.\nIt requires skill to aim with weapons,tactics and planning the paths with your abilities,vehicles,gliders...and all of this stuff. It doesnt matter if you have the best weapon in-game. Its useless if you cant hit your opponent. But as i mentioned,its extremly irregularly updated.\n1 minor patch per year. If it was regularly updated and if they brought new stuff,like Digital Extremes and their Warframe F2P game does...that would be nice.\nRECAP\nGameplay:      10/10\nGame Devs:    1/10","July 23, 2015","true","825.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(world bosses, invasions, etc.)\n+ Good gunplay combined with the skills of the Battleframe.\n\nCons:\n- Quests are very similar to each other, for example: go to point A, kill some dudes or scan some trash, then go to point B, then kill some more dudes or scan some more trash, then go back to the questgiver. The Only quests that stand out are some story missions and dungeons/ instances.\n- Leveling up Battleframes takes a long time.\n- Large amount of bugs and glitches, which range from graphical bugs, sound bugs and even some nasty gameplay bugs.

I have been playing since it's somewhat long beta, before it was released on Steam, and have seen the game change quite a bit. It started out as a open world, sandbox game. But, as the deadline for release got closer, the developers opted for the typical linear MMO model. For this game, it may not be a bad thing, as the sandbox portion from beta was somewhat lacking.\n\nThe FPS portion of the game is excellent. You'll only need one character, as your "class" is determined by what battleframe you are wearing. Battleframes are basically wearable mech suits with jump jets. You'll find your standard questing, a job board so you always have something to do, mixed in with open world missions and events that will randomly spawn. You can easily play solo, team up for missions and event, or just follow everyone to the event, as everyone that's participates gets credit for completing open world missions.\n\nThe game is fully free to play, no tricks. You can pay for new battleframes, frame paint, etc in the in game store, or you can max a starter frame to unlock a new frame, or save up your money ingame and buy it from another player on the auction. Everything is earnable with a little work. As with any free to play with cash shop game, drop a couple dollars on the game if you like it, only way it will stay running.\n\nThe game is lacking somewhat in the content department. There isn't much group content as you would expect. There is a handful of instances at endgame, along with a warzone, where you fight for land control vs The Chosen (the big baddies of the game), and there is a open world PvP zone if you like that sort of thing. For most people, the endgame is leveling up new battleframes.\n\nOne thing to note, as of 7/2015, there are major changes on the way. With the game getting ready for it's release in Asia, many of the frames, perks, and equip will be reworked in a major patch coming soon. Hopefully, there will be new content released.\n\nAs of now, I'd recommend trying the game out, but not getting too invested until all the changes have been put in place.\n\nAll in all, the game has huge potential, and definitely worth a look if you're sick of the standard tab target MMO.","July 5, 2015","true","341.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You will want to play through the areas again and again with your lower levelled classes, as they are all enjoyable.  The world is overflowing with events, and though standard questing has been added it can be ignored in favor of endless events (thank goodness, because the questing kinda stinks).  I have never felt pressured to spend money, though I have (once, on a good deal for a respawnable glider).  All classes can be unlocked by levelling your other classes, and the in game currency can be exchanged for the premium currency.\n\nThe game is beautiful, bringing a vibrant outlined look with a sci fi setting that somehow feels right.  Inspirations from the Tribes series are seen in the jetpacks, the art design, and the class design.  The music is similarly beautiful, particularly the ambient synth tracks and the mournful piano melody.  Sound brings the same excellence in quality, though occassional bugs have me hearing an object producing static instead of the intended effect.\n\nFor the problems, though, which do exist;\n\n- the game continues to have bugs.  It is a large game, so it is to be expected, but I feel like they should be worked on some more.\n\n- the game used to have very limited content.  This has since been expanded with more events, more zones, the main storyline, and the quest system... but the storyline and quest system kind of stink.  As such you will likely find yourself focusing on doing the event missions over and over, and even though the missions are random and will have different enemies and objectives, they will take place in the same locations.\n\n- the grind.  With one of the (many) revamps of the game mechanics, the focus was changed from crafting focus to levelling focus.  To get the most out of your frame, you will need to level up several frames.  Right now it seems to me like the perks you get for levelling frames are not so powerful as to force you to level them all, but are still coming off as rewarding.  Others may feel differently.\n\n- slow updates.  The game does not seem to have enough people working on it to pump out updates at the pace of.. pretty much any other game.  I assume this is because of their overly generous f2p model, which basically lets people have the game without spending a cent.  Maybe I will stop being part of the problem and spend a little more on it.\n\n- finally, it must be said that the developers of this game have completely revamped the game many times.  Now that they consider the game "released" I do think it is less likely that we will see another complete rework of the game, but it is worth noting that there have been some extreme changes several times since the game became playable.\n\n\nTo wrap it up, this is an amazing game that I think must be played.  It is the type of game that you fall in love with and then end up resenting for not being as incredible as it could have been.  Just do not forget that it is still pretty incredible even with the shortfalls it has.  If you ever thought Tribes would make a good PvE game, or thought that a shooter could make a good MMO, you need to try this game.  If you just like co op, you should try this game.  If you like open worlds with tons of events, you should try this game.  Really, give it a shot already, the whole thing is free.","June 7, 2015","true","23.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've been TRYING to figure out how to write a short review for this game for quite some time, and I think I've got it figured out.\n\nThis game has come MILES from where it started in some good ways (like simplifying gear / crafting), and in some bad ways (like simplifying gear / crafting). Let me explain that briefly: There used to be a BAJILLION resources, seriously look it up, and it was completely silly. They managed to trim it down to base resources, and it was certainly (unless you have some form of crazy you agree) a vast improvement. The problem is, this game with a complete dumbing down of the gear system. You used to be able to deeply customize your frames (jump jets - armor - energy - speed) all kinds of stuff, and it was pretty cool (though a bit rough to keep up with in crafting). The new version basically lets you equip a "core" that modifies energy, jumping, etc. and then lets you equip ability modules, and guns, that's it. I know, I know, it's way more simple, but in a strange way, it also killed some of the MMO feeling to the game.\nThe story is ... well ... there now, which is another huge step up. The voice-over missions are a nice touch, and the expanded zones hare pretty sweet as well (though it's a bit sparse in terms of content).\n\nNow, for people that don't give a crap about what the game used to be in contrast, here's the quick and dirty list:\n\nGOOD:\nThe game is easy on the eyes, has character for days, controls are tight, combat is fun, guns feel good, kills are gratifying (even after your millionth one).\nBAD:\nGetting around sucks, which means you are going to buy a vehicle from the cash shop rather you want to or not (unless something has changed in my off time in which case I'll edit this), Thumping for resources doesn't feel as meaningful as it should, crafting is a bit shallow, no reason for alts / re-rolls at all (possibly a good feature), world (though huge) still doesn't feel very fleshed out, and it's oddly demanding on system resources for a fairly old game (poor optimization).\n\nShould you play it?\nYeah, sure, why the hell not? As a FTP title, it's fine. Install it, run through a few hours, worst case scenario you don't like it, and you uninstall it. If you have a few buddies to play the game with, it's a pretty good time (I don't much care for it solo but maybe that's more your bag).\n\nThere you have it.","May 15, 2015","true","41.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's in no way "pay-to-win", which is good.\n\nEdit: So I have a much better computer and DAMN does the game look so pretty now. Anyway, a could of things have changed, though overall I still recommend the game.\n\nFirstly, grinding. Unfortunately, the late game is full of it. Levelling slows down around the 30s, and the end-game areas (Devil's Tusk, Amazon) are quite lacking in polished content and options. Many of the later game missions feature at least one protect or escort mission, which at that level, you can only hope the Accord teleports them to the end of the route, or you get really lucky.\n\nSecondly, I dealt with the Rangers who handle support and I have to say, they're very friendly. So that's good.\n\nThirdly (and this is really just me), there's still a lack of a decent wiki. This could be seen as a good thing, as an incentive to be a part of the community (of which some members are very helpful)... But as someone who likes to read, it's a little annoying having to always ask for information.\n\nLastly, Red Beans. The game still isn't pay to win, not in the slightest. I still don't fully believe that the amount they give you for your money justifies the purchase in the first place. I would recommend to anyone looking to support the developers to purchase the "Mercenary" pack, get an advanced frame to the level cap and exchange the low-tier currency up to into Red Beans.","February 24, 2015","true","504.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Otherwise I would have wasted some good money.\n\nOkay, so it's TRIED to be individual, and to "fix" things that are wrong with MMOs. Well, trying is fine in alpha and such, but now? It just doesn't cut it.\n\nUpon first entering the game, you enter a tutorial to teach you about the game's basics. That's all well and good, and tutorials aren't meant to be absolutely amazing and show the game at its best, but they should show you a taster of the game and encourage you to indulge more time into it. However, this isn't the case. Graphics are poor, textures are just splotchy and undefined. This is slightly less on your gun, but even so, the background and scenery is not fantastic. Looking past this, I endevour to listen to the awkward narration informing me about the classes. Slightly generic classes, yet they look fun to play, especially the one called "Assault" where you have a rifle and jetpack-thing. The jetpack proved to be the only fun part.\n\nYou're thrown into some shooting and you need to defend certain locations from enemies, which is standard for tutorial, and I accepted it. So I was shooting away, along with various other people, and the first thing I noticed was that there was no satisfaction for me. I was shooting these aliens or whatever, and they gave no response. The only thing you notice is their helath dereasing, but then you're not sure whether it's you doing that, or other players. There's no change when shot, they just keep coming at you until they're dead. Now that's a fantastic part of all shooters, the satisfaction of eliminating your targets in the game, and receiving a reaction, whereas you may not be able to do the same thing "irl".\n\nSo this, along with other reasons, discouraged me and drained the fun out of the experience. The tutorial kind of sucked. Which made me not want to play any more of the game. Well I tried to play more, but upon finishing the tutorial and loading up the next mission, the game crashed and shut down. Zero motivation to load it up again, zero motivation to play it again.\n\nTry it, as it's free and might be your cup of tea, but I wasnt satisfied with FireFall.","July 31, 2014","false","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

As a whole the game keeps the player involved and gives them a set goal that looms throughout the game while still maintaining the importance of side goals and missions. Besides this the graphics maintain a great quality throughout the game even on the lowest settings. It is worth noting that the game does have a slight "pay to win" feel at first, but with effort most if not all of the things that can be defined as "important" can be earned with time and not money. All this coupled with it's well written missions and stellar player interaction makes it a must have in most gamers' libraries.\n\n9/10\nWell worth the "nothing" it costs\nWould recommend to most players interested in MMO RPGs and Indie type games","April 29, 2015","true","100.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are pretty nice encounters and dungeons with fine voice acting that i liked. Bosses are fun to kill and PvP is also enjoyable.. Shooting MMO is something kinda new and this one is from the better ones... BUT... The loot policy in this game is TOTALY wrong. Imagine 10 hours raid in WoW with nothing but green drops. Yes, thats Firefall. They try to slow down players progression that much, that is unacceptable. The fact that shooting game isn't for relaxing (like WoW mainly is), it makes raiding more fun, but you also feel more tired after an hour raid for example... And if you find totaly nothing (No DKP / token system) from that raid.. i really mean NOTHING.. you are pretty disappointed and you feel like you wasted your hour. Every single patch they do follows this loot policy... like a week ago they added a new patch with new dungeon. It was fun to play, again.. i enjoyed it. The dungeon run took me around 40 minutes with other players and guess what i got from the last boss as only reward? Green item. Thats it, 40 minutes wasted, i don't want to do that again.\n\nRaid timers reset at wednesday, people usually login just to do time-locked raids (where you have like 10% to get 1 purple item, which is the biggest chance you get in this game) but today, there was like 10 people wanting to raid in the whole EU server. After the last patch, where devs promised "changes to loot system" but players still got screwed, most of them just left the game...\n\nThe game is dead, no playerbase and im leaving too. Great game killed by series of bad decisions and horrible loot system.","November 26, 2014","false","308.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There was a lack of content at launch for the Americas and Europe but they've added a lot of content since then.  As a free to play game I can safely recommend it but I should note several caveats in doing so.\n\nThis is really still a game in beta development at this point despite the fact that it was launched as finished product in the Americas and Europe.  This is pretty much undeniable as they have already gone through several small iterations of changes in core game mechanics such as the perk system, the module system used to customize player gear, an overhaul of the crafting system and changes in group loot distribution mechanics.\n\nThe real launch is probably going to be the launch of the game in China at which point they are going to implement a gigantic block of changes that are going to substantively change core game mechanics such as weapon characteristics such as rate of fire, recoil and unique characteristics for some such as overheating for the Plasma Canon for the Assault Battle Frames, removal of a core aspect of the modules (power rating which scales damage up), and a complete redesign of the crafting system, scaling of mob damage and many other things.\n\nWhat this means is that the game you are going to be playing if you choose to play this game now instead of waiting until the end of the year will not be what the game is going to be with the China launch.  That also means that your gear will most likely be devalued with those changes which some players may want to avoid because that is a significant loss of investment of a player's time.  There has already been mention of item migration (the exchange of current in game items for new ones) for the crafting system but historically item migration in this game has meant inventory nerf.\n\nTherefore while I can recommend the game to play as a free to play game, I cannot recommend you invest any actual money in this game until there is a clear vision of what the game is after the China launch and, if you believe you would be frustrated seeing all or many of the fruits of your in game labor getting nerfed, I would advise you to hold off playing the game until then as well.\n\nOne final note, the state of PvP in this game is pretty bad and probably as low as you're likely to find in any game.  The PvP comprises of duels and open world pvp in a region called Broken Peninsula, but the open world PvP has been shut down by the devs as a failure even though players can still engage in PvP there without the rewards system.  Arena PvP is going to be part of the China release version but currently no one has any idea what that will be like.","June 1, 2015","true","282.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Even so they changed alot in the process and you gotta start over a couple of times, I´m quite satisfied with the state its in right now.\n\nIts rare in any MMO for having so much opportunities. All the Battleframes for example. Even if you dont wanna spend any money on the game you got 5 frames to start with and once you leveld em up you can unlock even more frames.\n\nAnd if you get bored by one frame (which doesnt happen if you choose the right one for you), you can just switch to another frame.\n\nYou got alot of quests, missions, weapons, skills, areas and pvp just to name a few things.\n\nThe game takes quite some time to explore and find all the features in the game, but seriously who wants to finish an MMO in one week? :)\n\nYou dont even have to spend money to level up faster, coz with a group you´re allways leveling up no matter if you got the xp boost or not.\n\nAll the new missions are fun too and the worldmap is alot bigger then in the beginning. The game isnt as complex anymore with all the diffrent resources gone, which some people like and some hate, but its easier to understand if you´re new to the game.\n\nSo all in all the game is awesome and was definitely worth the 100$ for the founders pack and I´m spending another 100$ for the Digital Deluxe Edition coz in my opinion I had alot of fun in this game and will have in the future:)\n\nTry it out, if you like it support the game^^","August 3, 2014","true","48.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Up until December 2015 it was actually looking promising. Then they decided to ♥♥♥♥ up everything again, because apparently the devs can't go more than 6 months without changing everything. They removed all the weapon alt-fire modes just to slap on ADS on everything and turned down the run speed so the game is slow as hell. All the passive perks that made the frames different were removed because they were too confusing? What the ♥♥♥♥ Red 5?\n\n\n\nFirefall was a promising massive open world shooter with arena PvP, now it is just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ crafting/economy based MMORPG with no PvP. Another game killed by its developers. It seems they fixed most of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t! No more gear breaking permanently, crafting and resources have been simplified, and although it not Arena PvP there is Open World PvP in the game now.\n\nBiggest issue right now that I see is inventory slots. I had 700+ items in my inventory since the last time I played last summer/fall. The item cap is at 155, so the first hour or so I was just salvaging junk to get under the cap so my character could move, and I spent all the Red Beans (ingame currency) I had left on buying item slots to get up to 235. Having the cap start at 200 and go up by 25 at same prices would be better.","July 17, 2014","false","403.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Most Of The World Events Are The Same Like Crashed Thumpers And Crashed LGV Which Are The Most Common. The Best Time For World Events Is When The Servers Come Back Online After A Update. You Will Find Your Self Running Back And Forth A Lot To Job Bords. A Lot Of Grinding Is Involved. Having Friends That Play The Game Makes It A Little Better Due To The Fact That Mobs Spawn Depends On How Many Players Are Withtin The Area.

You Start With The Basic Warframes And Can level Them To Level 40 By That Time You Can Get An Advanced Warframe Which Is A Little Diffren From The Basic. You Do Not Have To Get A Advanced Warframe Form The Same Class Set You Can Get A Warframe Form The Other Set. For Example If You Get And Recon To 40 You Can Get An Advance Enginer Warframe Insead Of An Advance Recon Warframe Due to The Fact You Only Earn Pilot Credits To Unlock Frames. Walking is Pretty Slow And The Map Is Pretty Big So It Will Take Some Time To Walk From One Side Of The Map To The Other Unless You Take The Ships From Town To Town. The World Map Is Bigger Than Just The Area You Start In. if You Scroll Out You Will Find That Thier Are Other Areas Other Than Just That One Location Free Of The Melding.

My personal opinion on this game is pretty neutral. As for why I put a thumbs down on this review it felt like right thing to do at the time. Alrighty then, here is my review.\n\nOkay, before anyone says anything about the steam timestamp I want to say that I had been playing Firefall since the closed beta had really kicked off at some point just after 2010. The game is fun for if you want to go kill things and the visuals are good. I even put many many hours into the game. However, even though it has a certain amount of good things going for it there are a certain amount of things that happened to make me feel like I won't reccommend it. Am I being unreasonable? Maybe. I know it's just a game, and the developers can do whatever the like with it. But to be honest, I guess it's more about how dissapointed I am with where the game has gone since I started playing it.\n\nFirst off, to understand where I am coming from I need to say some things about the beta and how the game had really changed from the initial designs when the game first started out.\n\nStarting out, I thought the game had just about everything going for it. You had the different kinds of battleframes which you could switch back and forth from with no penalty costs, the begining tutorial was pretty good in introducing you to the idea of having to kill the bugs and the chosen, and in getting you to try and collect the resources by "thumping". They even had a pretty fun setup for doing team matches and deathmatches.\n\nAfter a while a new update came out and took out the medic battleframe and changed it into the Biotech. It really affected some of the playstyles that you had come up with at that point. Which was okay since it was something different and it just took a bit of getting used to.\n\nLater on, there was another update that added assault fights with the chosen and those were fun to. They even upgraded the battleframe system too and it looked cool and was fun to use.\n\nBut, then things started to change when the Founders packs showed up and the Bean market started. When I first heard of it I thought that it could be cool, but when it was enabled it wasn't anything like I thought it would be. Starting out, the prices were pretty outragous. While the first tier of the the founders pack was around the price of a new game and would have been okay the higher ones were kinda rediculous. But even worse was the Bean market and it's prices. I remember that one pair of cosmetic goggles was like $5 and higher. While I understand that since the game is free to play they needed money to keep it going it was just like "Wow, are they kidding me?". I put up with it because for me the rest of the game was still fun to play at that point and things could change.\n\nChange they did. After a number of months after being inactive because of being busy, I logged back in just before the game came out on steam. The tutorial is completely different and even parts of the map are different. The Bean costs are still way too high and I don't think its right to charge people that much for cosmetics, especially since from what I can tell it is pretty hard to earn beans in game.The parts that bugged me the most though is how the Battleframe system has changed, and how it penalizes you with a cost for if you want to change your class.\n\nI don't know what happened to make them end up putting those changes in the game but it kind've ruined the experience that I had with them.\n\nI personally say that you should download it and try it for yourself to determine what you think about it. You can't always solely rely just on other people's reviews to determine if you will like a game or not.","August 22, 2014","false","1.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Graphics are pretty, combat can be fun ( has some big firefights), classes have different cool abilities. However, it lacks a lot of things to do in game. You pretty much just go back and forth from job boards doing essentially the same thing: killing either bandits or monsters, and/or collecting crap. Thats it. Scenery hardly changes so you really start to get tired of looking at the same jungles and swamps and crap by level 20. Customization is essentially crap, no skill trees or anything to make your dreadnought different from other ones. Most the basic cosmetic customization costs money, and theres no customization for armor besides paint, so you'll look the same from level 1 to 40 unless you want to pay to change your color a few times.

Bit of the same hopes I had with Defiance.\n\nBut it is the same kind of disappointment.\n\nDon't get me wrong : if you like endless and mindless grinding, graphics coming straight from 5 years ago in a game having a hard time being stable (those freezes, man...), a chat window full with Cyrillic, you'll love FireFall.\n\nIf you're searching for a good shooter with nice mechanics and non stop action, please do turn back. You'll be running and/or Jetpacking a good 70% of the time here. Vehicles are mostly 1 time uses (because when you don't need you bike anymore, make it explode), if you don't have credits.\n\nThis leads me to the economic system of the game. Minerals/Metals, Research Points, Crystite, Recycling products, Time (yes, time is kind of something you have to take in account while crafting), Credits, Red Beans... There is way too much currencies in this game. You'll spend a huge amount of time acquiring said resources, for a very, very small reward. While leveling I had this issue more than once : I research a crafting recipe (needs : Time, Crystite, Research), once it's researched I need to go farm some recyclables, crystite and ore. Then I need to craft (Time & Metals) the components for my final recipe. Then I craft my recipe. Aaaaand it's 2 levels below me now, a green loot would render all this farming useless.\n\nAlthough there are some good points in this game too, mainly the fact that you can unlock any BattleFrame (= Classes) when you level one at the maximum level, this does not outweight the bad.\n\nBy the way, I would have recommended this game before. So if you want to test it, level up to, say, 15, you'll probably have a  nice time.

I probably will still play it, but if you played the beta, you will be dissapointed.","August 23, 2014","false","66.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dysfox/recommended/227700/","dysfox","Dys","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dysfox/","66 products in account","TL;DR and Pros and Cons at bottom.\n\nFirefall is an interesting and diverse take on the FPSMMO genre of games, allowing a player to take on many different roles, and exploring team dynamics in a way very few other games have mastered. Each squad member will find themselves useful and needed at one point or another because of something that only they can do, and that's one of the things that makes Firefall a beautifully executed game. However, it's certainly not without it's faults. There are several instances where the game will become a long stretch of repetitive mission grinding, or thumping for resources. It can be excruciatingly annoying when you have to grind just to level up your character, doing missions that are essentially 'go here, press e, go there, kill these guys, etc.' The game does redeem itself however. Some of these missions you find at ARES job boards actually have fairly interesting stories and characters interwoven into them, making the repetitveness worth it. For example, a job at Sunken Harbor had me laughing quite a bit at a character known as the Meddler. Her personality was so over-the-top ridiculous, that it was hard to NOT love her. In addition to the job boards, the game builds upon the story through campaign missions which can be played at any time, so long as you meet the minimum level requirements. Some of these campaign missions will have you traveling into dangerous territory in order to save a crashed dropship pilot. Others will have you escorting a cart carrying broken equipment. Even more will pit you against seemingly endless waves of enemies as you desperately try to keep your foothold in their territory.\n\nThat's what makes Firefall beautiful. It's an incredible experience, and I highly recommend you jump into this enthralling universe.\n\n\nTL;DR // PROS AND CONS:\n\nFirefall is a very different take on the FPSMMO genre of games, and is well worth your time.\n\nPROS:\nMassive world\nGreat graphics\nPlethora of random events\nDiverse classes allowing for incredible team dynamics\nTons of weapons\nPlayer-driven economy system via the in-game Marketplace\nOtherwise, ridiculously fun\nCONS:\nCan be extremely grindy\nMissions found on Job Boards tend to be repetitive\nSomewhat steep learning curve\nOVERALL RATING: 9.5/10","February 25, 2015","true","117.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

In that time a lot has changed.  I used to think the game was beautiful before I upgraded my video card.  Now I can't believe my eyes.  I used to like the fact that the playable world was big.  Now it's more than 4 times as big.  I used to get a kick out of going from missions to mining to dynamic world events to watchtower defense to full-scale invasions because I could play for hours on end without doing the same thing twice.  Now there is so much to do that I haven't even done it all.\n\nWith a single character you can trade out at any time between 16 different battleframes (basically different classes), focusing on whatever playstyle you choose at that moment.  If you're not sure what to do, then just go do anything; it all gives xp, it all gives loot, it all gives currency.  If you really have no idea, there are job boards in every town with a variety of short missions.  If you don't feel like doing anything in particular, just explore.  The scenery is gorgeous and varied, the music is incredible (I once spent several minutes sitting at the login screen just listening to a favorite track), and the community is generally talkative and quite helpful besides.\n\nMix all that in with a rich storyline from Orson Scott Card (Ender's Game), and you have a winner.  Also, there are 2 things I almost forgot to mention; first, every frame has jumpjets and access to gliders.  From a mobility/travel standpoint, this is pretty big.  Every time I go back to Borderlands, I find myself wishing I had a jetpack.  You really do miss it when you don't have it.  Second, this is the most Free-To-Play F2P game I have ever played.  99.9% of what's in the game can be obtained with in-game currency.  As for the other 0.1% (which mainly consists of the larger vehicles), it has been confirmed that most of it will be available for crafting with in-game currency in a future update.  You never have to spend a dime on this game to be competitive (or pretty).\n\nAll in all, this was my favorite game of the past couple years, and one of the best and best-looking MMO's that I've ever played.

And I want to address those 2 things.\n\nNow I can't claim I've played it all, and I am sure there might be some pattern breakers out there, but every game has some form of grinding to it. How otherwise would you discern the players that have spent hundreds of hours playing from the ones that spent only a few. At least here in Firefall you can chose your grinding grounds as it isn't specified to a certain single mob you have to kill over or so. Anyway I dare you to think about most MMOs nowadays and then honestly claim they don't have some form of grinding, I dare you!\n\nAnd about that "game gets boring" thing. Those are players who never played co-op. Playing this co-op with friends over any form of voice chat is just awesome. The laughs and the giggles. Changing tactics and the way you approach things while you play is priceless.\n\nKeep that in mind when you decide to play Firefall.

Well, you can have all this and more! With a graphics style making small nudges towards the Borderlands series this game can be difficult to run at best, it needs some optimization. The devs also need to improve the quality for their server connections and UI to CHOOSE WHAT ZONE TO JOIN! Other than the key UI pieces that are missing, gameplay-wise this game is great, it can get tough if you get too close to an area that is too high level for your current Battleframe (Hmm, where is that other game about frames that are used for battle right now?) in all honesty as I play the game it becomes more and more addictive because of the fun elements that this game brings to MMOs in general.\n\nDue to the difficulty to get the game to run on less powerful PCs and the patchy server connections I’d give this game a 7/10.","April 1, 2015","true","46.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I guess it's time to do it.\n\nMy concept of Firefall in a nutshell is "three Cs": cozy, comfortable, and casual.\n\nIt is a small world of several islands of life amongst an ocean of sinister, death-bringing dark energy.  You won't be lost amidst huge wastelands like you do in Planetside 2, for example. Nothing is far from you, and quite soon all the whereabouts will be familiar to you - as if it was a humble village where you spent your childhood. The bright and sunlit Coral Forest will be a place you'll always want to return to.\n\nGame creators invested a lot of effort into making Firefall friendly, easy, and fun. You'll constantly feel their care for you - just from the moment when they'll give you a personal bike at the very beginning, so that you would not have to waste time running around on feet. It might even be demotivating a bit: you've just started, and you already have everything you basically need.\n\nIt's a game where you can come to and find some activity to engage in for an hour or two. Or more. There's always something going on. A minor mission. A zone-wide event. A huge three-staged operation. A mining enterprise. Whatever.\n\nThat's what Firefall's appeal consists of for me.\n\nOther things you might be interested in knowing:\n\n- This is an MMO open-world sci-fi skill-based shooter set in distant future.\n\n- The game mostly consists of PvE content. Principal accent is made on players' cooperation against said environment; in most cases, solo playstyle is possible as well.\n\n- Open-world activities are randomly generated in certain spots. The selection of possible mission types is not very rich; seeing how the same mission develops differently each time is a more likely source of fun than the diversity of missions themselves.\n\n- Everything can be achieved for free. Any thing that can be bought for real money can also be bought for in-game money. With donations, you only get things faster.\n\nMy basic advice is the same as for any other free-to-play game: it never hurts to give a try. Enter this world and see if you like it.","June 18, 2015","true","813.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There is crafting, progression, and end game currently, and it looks like it's only going to get better from here.\n\nIt does have some negative points, but most of them are either being worked on by the dev's currently (engame content, PvP,etc), are being planned to be workd on (crafting, repetitiveness, etc.), or are a matter of personal taste.","November 28, 2014","true","951.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","1"

I guess it's time to do it.\n\nMy concept of Firefall in a nutshell is "three Cs": cozy, comfortable, and casual.\n\nIt is a small world of several islands of life amongst an ocean of sinister, death-bringing dark energy.  You won't be lost amidst huge wastelands like you do in Planetside 2, for example. Nothing is far from you, and quite soon all the whereabouts will be familiar to you - as if it was a humble village where you spent your childhood. The bright and sunlit Coral Forest will be a place you'll always want to return to.\n\nGame creators invested a lot of effort into making Firefall friendly, easy, and fun. You'll constantly feel their care for you - just from the moment when they'll give you a personal bike at the very beginning, so that you would not have to waste time running around on feet. It might even be demotivating a bit: you've just started, and you already have everything you basically need.\n\nIt's a game where you can come to and find some activity to engage in for an hour or two. Or more. There's always something going on. A minor mission. A zone-wide event. A huge three-staged operation. A mining enterprise. Whatever.\n\nThat's what Firefall's appeal consists of for me.\n\nOther things you might be interested in knowing:\n\n- This is an MMO open-world sci-fi skill-based shooter set in distant future.\n\n- The game mostly consists of PvE content. Principal accent is made on players' cooperation against said environment; in most cases, solo playstyle is possible as well.\n\n- Open-world activities are randomly generated in certain spots. The selection of possible mission types is not very rich; seeing how the same mission develops differently each time is a more likely source of fun than the diversity of missions themselves.\n\n- Everything can be achieved for free. Any thing that can be bought for real money can also be bought for in-game money. With donations, you only get things faster.\n\nMy basic advice is the same as for any other free-to-play game: it never hurts to give a try. Enter this world and see if you like it.","June 18, 2015","true","813.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Anything can be obtained through sufficient playtime.\n- Combat is interesting. Generally solid, fun to engage.\n- Community is great. Players are generally good people.\n- Many playstyles available.\n\nCon's:\n- Still a lot of bugs.\n- Mission diversity is very low. A lot of the same objectives with different voice actors.\n- Enemy diversity is pretty low. End up fighting the same mechanics frequently.\n- Gear is very limited.\n- A lot of game mechanics are poorly explained, if at all.\n\nI think the game was a lot of fun, getting my first frame to cap. The world events and mission lines were a lot of fun on my first playthrough. However, even with the XP boost, I just can't seem to muster the interest to go through it all again. The quest base isn't diverse enough to do anything but grind through the same dozen or so quests per area, and since random mobs are all but non-existent (and ridiculously low XP), you're all but forced to do them. Yes, there are random encounters, so to speak, but again, they are the same few events all the time.\n\nThere are only a few instances, which were pretty well done. Finding groups isn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be, given the relatively small player base. Running solo could usually be done as well, if you're decent.\n\nCrafting was... unimpressive. I liked that it was fairly straightforward, and that I could craft most things in the game. The problem is the cost/benefit. Crafting is very, very expensive and time consuming on the front end, for relatively mediocre outputs. Given how easy most useful items are to obtain, versus how long it takes to get anything useful from crafting, it's basically not worth doing.\n\nI think the game is worth playing through at least once. It did offer some things that most F2P don't, which I enjoyed. While it's not perfect, it's still a pretty good offering.","March 21, 2015","true","82.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

I first tried installing it on steam but once I got done with it the "redhand error" would come up. after trying to work around it it came to the point the game would not open the launcher. I then tried downloading it from firefalls site and the launcher would crash very 10 minutes.. I tried the other full download which i had to chage browsers to get it to work which it also stoped farly often making me take about 10 hours longer. even fter all that the same error would come up then seems the firefall folder was empty so I can't even find the launcher or try to make any of the changes... and trying to run it again just made the thing ask to unintall it or do close it. So this game just has a bunch of crap keeping it from actully playing the game which really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off I even tried bothering with this annoying as hell game.

It was a pretty nice game though. You could play with different types of gears, and playstyles. The game itself looks nice, but it's not exactly an open world. Also for dungeons I didn't understand any of it. There's a hole in what should be party making. I also didn't experience anything like a clan or guild or some sorts. That was very disappointing. The questing was alright, sometimes a bit dull and you keep running all over the place, while getting attacked by monsters all the time. There were events too, but I never really saw an announcement so I never knew what to do with it. I mainly did normal quests and leveled up several gears. Theres not really anything else I could do, because I didn't understand it too much.

(3 level restricted maps. 1 pvp zone and a handfull of mission maps)\nIts extremely easy to level up. You can do it solo all the way to 40 or with a group, it doesnt matter. In the end it should take you no more than a week to hit 40.\n\nOnce you hit 40 you have a few options.\n1. For every class you get to 40, you get to unlock one advanced class. In which you can get that one to level 40 and unlock another one.\n2.You use your level 40 and do the same 2 end game missions with a small group and hope you get good items for your end game build\n3. You can participate in some utterly broken PVP where people fly around and spam their AOE weapons and destroy the other classes with no AOE and cant hit fast moving targets.\n\nWhen it comes to skills, you get to use only 4 plus an extra 2 that you can change out ones you dont like. And with an advanced class you can use the 6 from the basic default class, but thats about it. Not alot of variety.\n\nThis game lacks serious content for a game thats been around since 2012 and will end in extreme boredom for any serious gamer.

I played this game alone for 10-15h and found it "really not bad". Univers setting are pretty cool. (I dont like medieval fantastic things, so that probably why I never really tried any mmo).\n\nGameplay is cool. Multiple classes that you really feel are differents.\n\nStory ? hmmm I can't tell, I pretty much didn't care about it. But one of the NPC has a cool voice with nice accent ... (sorry, can't tell that much)\n\nVisuals : clearly not  "top notch graphics" but it's fine enough. some models are clearly ♥♥♥♥, some are good. The general univers is kinda nice to look at. It's always a pleasure to get a look at the full panorama when you're on top of an high mountain :D\n\nsound ?  bah... I can't tell... I muted the music after 1-2hours because I prefer to listen to my own spotify playlists while runing around\n\nf2p/p2w ?  seems fine enough. Played the first 20h without investing. Was good enough, but a lot of time "wasted" in walking around.  then I decided to give it a "retail price" and put 50€ in. Bought some way to move around and ... It was worth it :D\n\nother : pretty good lag compensation management. I was looking for a game to hang out with a friend who went in china (I'm in EU) while chatting over mumble.

There's a strange lack of open-world MMO shooters, but this one has still managed to mostly slip under the radar somehow, and it's a shame because it's a pretty decent game.\n\nThe core gameplay is pretty simplistic, but it's reasonably challenging for the most part without relying on being grossly unfair, and the "big gimmick" of being able to jump around with your rocket pack while you shoot at enemies from above works fairly well, with most combat taking place in big open areas that allow you to make good use of the environment. Although the basic combat never really changes, the five basic battleframes that you start out with have enough little variations in weapons and abilities that they feel pleasingly different from each other, with the advanced versions building out on the basic ones to accentuate a particular playstyle.\n\nThere's not much in the way of equipment, but just about everything can be upgraded and modified by adding modules, so you have quite a degree of freedom to tweak your loadout to suit you. Unfortunately you can't really modify the appearance of the battleframe itself other than paint colours and patterns (most of which are locked behind a gambling/paywall) but there are a decent enough number of options to customise your character, and there's a good number of customisation options unlocked without having to pay extra so you shouldn't have much trouble making your character look how you want, and you can re-do your character's appearance at any time for free.\n\nThe levelling curve has been smoothed out considerably, and you can quite comfortably keep at an appropriate level to progress through the campaign quests without having to take time out and grind for excessive amounts of time. The plot is paper thin, but the quest text is mercifully unobtrusive, to the point that you'll probably miss most of it if you're not paying attention, leaving you to focus on the important business of killing everything in sight. Even with what little expositionary dialogue there is, it does a decent enough job at keeping you interested in the world with a mixture of one-off quests, short chains that lead you around a particular zone, and longer quests which tie multiple zones together and reveal a little bit of backstory, together with a much longer campaign quest chain that will keep popping up all the way to the level cap. There's also countless random repeatable quests which pop up randomly in the world, and zone events pop up fairly frequently that break up the monotony of questing and grinding.\n\nThere's no avoiding the fact that it's a F2P game, however, and the game's certainly not shy about reminding you about it at every possible opportunity. To its credit though, there's very little which is essential to the game that isn't available for free, and as the premium currency is tradeable in-game it's possible in principle (although very, very tedious) to grind your way to anything. In any event, most of the premium content falls under the categories of pure vanity items (battleframe paint jobs and decals), slightly better versions of things you can get a free version of (vehicles and consumable items) or convenience (XP bonusses, or instant unlocks for advanced battleframes).\n\nUltimately, the core gameplay is entertaining, there's plenty of content to keep you interested, everything looks great, and while the F2P mechanics are everywhere they don't utterly hamstring you like so many games do.

I started playing Fire Fall about 3 years ago. Like many people I was dissapointed iwith the direction it seemed to be taking. The crafting was impossibly difficult to understand, thumping was getting old, aand I decided to waiot until its official release to give it another shot.\n\nThere are some minor issues, but don't let these distract from the truly awesome game that Fire Fall now is. With the release to the public, this is not the end of the development. It is the beginning. Red 5 plans on continuously updating FireFall with new missions, new enemies, and a progressing story line that who knows where it will go.\n\nThe world is massive and growing. the gameplay is challenging and the Campaign missions keep you motivated to level up by completing jobs and Ares missions. While these may seem to some a bit repetitive, they are the tasks you complete to play the real meat of the gameplay which is the campaign missions.\n\nThe crafating has been revamped and although I am just now starting to explore that aspect of the game, I already like how it's implemented. It makes sense without having to google it, and the many battleframes available with their own unique weapons offer different ways to strategize.\n\nNO PAY WALL. This isn't some freemium game meant to trick you into committing time into a game only to slam into a poorly implemented pay wall. There is NO pay wall. The stuff you buy is cosmetic, the abililty to upgrade faster will appeal to many, but for those not interested in spending a dime, you won't be committed to grinding endlessly to up your experience. there's some grinding but I find it quite well balanced and not a chore to complete but rather a nice way to really get to know the world.\n\nSome minor issues are inconsistent quality of animation, some of the early missions are a bit annoying and overly simple, but once you get to about level 10, things really start o get interesting.\n\nIf you played this game before and gave up on it, you must really give it a try. This is not the game from beta testing, this is a seriously awesome game that I look forward to spending many hours  playing.\n\nExcellent job Red 5!\n\nI have approximately 99 hours logged in so far, and just hit level 21","July 30, 2014","true","434.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

No real indepth crafting.\n\nMaybe I'm spoiled, maybe I'm used to sandbox games, but this game just doesn't do it for me. I didn't get a chance to try the pvp but that's because I was so bored by the time I figured out what I was doing I just stopped playing.\n\nBoarderlands 3, thats it, play it if you like borderlands or facepaced shooters, but stay away from it if you are looking for an mmo to try.\n\nI can't even compare it to an mmo really, it's an mmo in the sense borderlands had a baby with wow, but then it inherited none of the wow traits. I don't get why this game is even being made, it's just some rehashed mumbo jumbo with nothing new to spice things up. During my time playing I didn't find anything that made me stop and say "cool". It's was like I was being tricked into playing because I was wearing a mech suit.\n\nThe voice acting is terrible as well.\n\nI will try this game a bit more and perhaps change my review.

There are three types of currency, and like STO you can upgrade the base to a second tier, and then use that second teir to get the Cash shop currency via currency market.\n\nCombat is ballenced with a group in mind, synergy is a strong point, however you can solo should you wish, its just a bit harder depending upon frame.

It's fun, single players can enjoy it just as well as group players. It has a very unique atmosphere and unique mobs to come across. It's a mix between borderlands 2 and an mmo. It sort of has a hit box along the lines of Neverwinter, except with battlesuits instead of magical powers. There are classes in the game that are akin to tank, dps, healer. You start off with one base class of each category and can pick which one you want to level first. If you want the tiered classes you can either purchase them or use a currency exchange. Interestingly, you have two options, you can either sub to the game or be a f2p member. As of yet, I don't see much difference except that V.I.P. members can enjoy exp buffs, and the ability to use a hang glider whenever you want - which  might sound silly but really cuts down on travel. The story was compelling enough and the landscape lush enough to just draw me right in.","July 20, 2014","true","55.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

New players however, wont know the difference obviously. Though they will have a fun time untill they hit the bugfall wall.\n\nThey completely changed the game. Not for the better. My rhino is pretty much useless now unless you enjoy aiming a boring laser beam within 30m. The movement system got nerfed the same way that warframe nerfed theirs. Much slower, and you now have to camp like a ♥♥♥♥♥ to surivive. The class that supposedly was a tank has now the most damage. And people are straight out blocking all your shots with their moving thunderdome. Oh, and ofcourse you got like 6 blocking thunderdomes, because everyone plays mammoth because its op.\n\nThe amount of bugs are unreal, and in all honesty some bugs should be fixed within no time. Not just annoying side bugs, but also alot of critical ones. Raiding? have fun trying to even get into the queue with you group, and if that works, there is a 80% chance someone dropped out. Forcing you to do it all over again just to be fair to that person.\n\nAs far as ive seen about 60% of the campaigns arent working, and the ones you can queue for are absolutely redicioulous. The bosses do no damage at all, while the adds can simply 3 shot you.\n\nThis game wont even remember your armor paint & decal. If you simply joined a raid you can customize it all over again. As alot have mentioned aswell, its all about tinkering now, and getting boosts. The tinker system has been used for so long in other games, i never thought red 5 would go down this road too.\n\nWith this update they took everyones items, promised us we would be compensated. All my frames were pretty much full gear. Now i only have 1 fully geared. Some people spent more time in farming items than me. Like for instance the lancer bike which takes a good amount of time to get, and its simply gone now.\n\nSome people are still playing and claiming to be smart in making good investments or by kissing moderators butts. They just dont know yet its all for nothing and they will never get anything back. Its not even worth the time to get anything at this point since L45 and L50 patch will drop IN LIKE 6 MONTHS.\n\nin all honesty its a update in progress, but i think they are already losing to many players. And there are posts from players that proof that the game is dying, with a current 800ish playerbase and dropping (which used to be over 2000). Well at this stage, it deserves to die.","February 9","false","765.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I love the crafting portion of the game and the refining of crude materials to be used as the base for more complex items. The server stability is not the best, but it is far from the worst also. This past week end it was impossible for a squad to stay together. The server chat, friends list, quest reward system and general NPC interaction was broken.  Today (Tuesday) the server keep rubber banding and dragging back to where i wAS 5 secs prior.\n\nI like the reward for logging every day.  you getting bonuses for experience or gather of resources based on consecutive days of logging in and playing. Once you miss one day, it resets and you start building up again. The FPS feel of the game is right and the graphics are beautiful. The enemies are challanging and the gear earned as rewards are good enough to carry you through without crafting at all.\n\nTravel is a bit challenging but even that is a sort of fun challenge in that you have to glide to your next location. It becomes a game within the game to make it without landing short. There are lots of regional events that spawn in that typically get all those int he area involved and the rewards are satisifying enough for you to stay involved in the next one you see pop up.\n\nIt is early but so far I think Red5 has a winning combo in FireFall. Overall score is 4 out of 5 Stars so far.","August 5, 2014","true","80.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","1"

And at the time I thought it just needed more content. But since then, with every new mission type they nerf an old one that used to be fun, make the progression system even more punishing. Hell, in the last update they REMOVED A CLASS from the game. Primary weapons used to have two fire modes, now they have one. The amount of enjoyable gameplay they have REMOVED from the game for NO REASON significantly outweighs any improvements the game has accumulated over the years.\n\nAnd it just makes me feel betrayed. Why bother to play, they'll just reset your progression in the next patch? Why bother to unlock the frames, they'll just remove them. Why farm when the resources will be deleted? There's nothing this game can offer you, because all the devs do is take it away again and again to try to eke out just a little more money from their dwindling player base.\n\nBut now even the whales have left. Look at the gameplay stats. This is what happens when a game with so much promise is released into the world to be enjoyed, only for the devs to continuously change EVERYTHING without improving ANYTHING.\n\nMaybe you'll have fun if you haven't played it before. But don't spend money on it. And for the love of god, if you have played Firefall in the past, DON'T COME BACK. It will just make you angry, and sad.\n\nEdit: I know I've played more than Steam says I have.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OwlG5/recommended/227700/","OwlG5","Owlkin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OwlG5/","242 products in account","Firefall has been through some rough times. I started playing in April 2012 and have seen the game change many times. Not every change has been one that people have liked, and months of progress have seemingly been tossed out at times. Not a few months ago I was of the mindset that Firefall was a dead game and nobody should bother playing it anymore. However, I don't feel that the game should be discounted yet, though. The launch patch will be Red5's final shot to show the world that their game is worth playing, and I feel that they might really pull through this time around with all of the things they've shown to the public so far. Launch looks to be the biggest and boldest update they've put out, from what they've shown in their "Path to Launch" series of blog posts on their site. More than tripling the size of the playable game area, adding in craploads of new creatures to fight, generated quests with dialogue, going back to a leveling system, removing permanent breakage of items, and many other changes that people have wanted for awhile.\n\nGive the game another shot come launch! I've been pleasantly surprised so far, and I'm sure I'll continue to be as I finally get to see what the game looks like at launch in the next few weeks.

I liked it in a way that when you fix all the bugs and other problems its perfect for me! A huge MMO where you can interact with a lot of players, You can do quests together, you can climb rocks, use your jetpack from here to there. Its like borderlands with a twist of other games, but sadly problems are there to ruin it. I know its P2P but damn! its like its still in beta. Theres a lot of bugs like the main menu freezing picture, MAJOR AUDIO DESYNC. 2 background music playing at the same time, multiple NPC talking to you, etc. Also theres no character customization at the beginning? or am I supposed to do that later at the game? or was my game bugged out? Running the game in ultra high but still i get jagged edges, blurry textures, etc. Also I always get a lag spike and getting delayed actions in some ways, I don't know if its my internet or the server. Also, it would be greater if theres another server. Players are all crammed up in 1 server! You don't know anymore what will you do with the mission. I expected more from FireFall, considering its been in Beta for quite some time and I think a lot of players paid for the closed beta which should make the game better. Well I guess I should wait for a couple of days or weeks to get a better quality of the game.\n\nI would recommend it IF YOU ARE PATIENT with the updates, fix, etc. I guess for now thats the condition, but when all problems are fixed, well I would really recommend it to those who are fans of 1st/3rd person shooter, jetpack action, MMORPG, with a lot of weird stuff games!","July 30, 2014","true","2.4"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

Yes right now there is room for polish, it has been developed by a small company (red 5) and this is currently their only / first (I think) project. This game has gone through some major changes since its inception. It is almost a completely different game from what it was back in the closed beta.\n\nThis current patch is only a couple weeks old and as such is still getting ironed out.

They've redone the UI a few times both ingame and the crafting menu's.  The skill shots are are one of the biggest flaws of this game.  Most of the time your fighting endless waves of TINY little critters that are just more of a hassle to hit then begin and actually challenge.  You never actually care about anything you do, the missions are generic go here do this, talk to this guy go get this stuff.  Begin so open and so free to b able to reroute to something else creates allot of inurgency for your current mission/job.  Besides the random missions that can happen around you the whole game centers around thumping (collection resources) which is either extremely ez or over the top difficult.  Ai is pretty stupid, its only with sheer numbers do things become a challenge.  There are many other things i could rant about but i will wrap up with this last bit.  Traveling yes you should explore and there are ways to get to other areas quickly.  But even with the ability to fly/glide/ride a bike you will still be thinking i wish there was a faster way to get to where i'm going.\n\nPros:\n\nVariety, ranging from what your doing and how your doing it there is many "diffrent" options.  I think there are 20+ different frames you can chose from and change at at hub.  Snipers, enigneers, medics, heavy gunners everything is here  the other 15+ are a mashup of these previous frames. Anyone interested in lore this game has a wealth of it, the story is pretty great i'd like to see where they go with it.  ITS NOT DEFIANCE, now for some of you this could be a good or bad thing but the jumpacks make this game open up SO much more.  Delv down into deep caves or climb the highest mountians in the area you will love flying around from place to place.\n\nAs of 7/26/14 this game needs allot more polish for me to throw some money at it, but its certianlly worth a try.  You will either b a lifer or you will not b intrested in it at all.  Just be a responsible player and give it 2-3 hrs before you uninstall it forever.","July 26, 2014","true","56.8"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","11","21","0","0"

The game is a pleasent blend of Planetside, Borderlands, WoW, and a flight sim.\n\nGraphics- The game's asthetics are pleasing to look at.  While nowhere near groundbreaking, the terrain looks nice and the people feel allive (as long as you can ignore the awkward animations). The many different places are all beautiful to look at and glide through.\n\nMechanics- The game machanics are what really sets this game apart from other MMOs.  The simple change to 1st person makes the combat so much faster and difficult.  While most games force you to learn what each move does in order to be good, this game makes you rely on your own skill to survive.\n\nStory- What can I say? It's an MMO, so the story is a little convaluted.  A giant space thing hit the earth and made everyone sad. Then aliens came to Earth and made everyone dead.  You're their only hope...blah blah blah... A few interesting questlines, but nothing to brag about\n\nCommunity- The community-from what I've seen-is very welcoming and friendly.  Sure there are one or two morons and jerks here and there, but overall it's a good community.  The economy is very, what's the word?... oh yes: unpredictable.  Realistic sure but frustrating too.\n\nOverview- The game is very good.  I give it a 9/10.","August 2, 2014","true","25.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

First 10 levels goes quickly, like within the first 2 hours quickly, so the next 10 were surprisingly slow.\n\nIf you're big in to the RPG/Loot system of today's "modern" massive gameplay titles (Borderlands, Destiny, etc etc) you'll be very disappointed.  I've replaced my main weapon on my Assault frame twice.  At level 17 I was still using a level 6 weapon.  I've replaced my secondary four times, but it was swapping between two types of rifle modes, burst or auto.\n\nBecause the gear system is so shallow in the first 20 levels (not sure if it gets better), be prepared for a lot of monotonous gameplay.  Your abilities aren't good enough to use as soon as they're off cooldown.  You are forced to use them in close range, making you take way more damage than you otherwise would, so often times you're just spamming six shots, reloading, spamming six shots, reloading.\n\nLeveling and going through missions is VERY typical of an MMO.  In firefall, they take that typical mission gameplay and they make it even more repetitive.  You'll visit the same spot for 5-6 different missions.  In the level 20 area, you'll be forced to climb an obnoxiously tall mountain to essentially play "errand boy" and be forced to glide down to get another mission just to go back where you were.  It's INSANELY repetitive to the point of frustrating.\n\nSo why am I recommending this?  Why does this game hit the "right notes"?  I played 8 hours with a friend and that's where the game shines.  Tag teaming fights, helping each other out, even trying to beat each other to mission checkpoints based on who could jetpack better or fly the longest on a glider was more fun than the actual missions being presented.\n\nDespite the monotonous gear and "kill this, fetch that" mission type, the game is still incredibly addictive and fun.  Getting to level 40 on one frame, just to start over on another frame, I suspect, will get old very fast.\n\nIf you're a big MMO fan, this game will be right up your alley.  If you're sick of MMOs and love RPGs or FPS games, this might be worth a try, but expect a lot of the same MMO shortfalls.","October 26, 2014","true","10.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Customer service that dont make you feel stupid or like cattle? As in, Red 5 responds to us in the forums, they play with us in game, they give us rewards, everything can be earned, i cant say enough about certain aspects of this game, aspects that really make a game worth sticking around to play and seeing what new content comes out,\n\nyep, new content comes out, new perks, weps, abilitys, warpaints for your battleframes, everything,,\n\nthis is how a gaming company should be, despite if they are BIG or small, just the interaction from red 5 with us in game and how they actually seem to care about its core players, this is how certain games should have been released (defiance) to name just one..\n\nwho dont want to fly around the world with a glider up high over mountains, oh you got tired of the glide? release from it and free fall, use your jetts and fly around, there is alot to do in FireFall, if you like to earn, farm, grind, group up, pve, oh and one of the biggest things for me about this game, since i was a GUI/video game skinner, i love to customize my character, this game is one of the best ever for that,,,\n\neveryone starts with a male or female model, you can switch from male to female on the fly, but you can customize everything, from whats on your head, face, eyes, ears, mouth and my favorite thing, Warpaints,,\n\nall you can buy with CREDS from the market, i have allmost everything nice and had them for awhile, working a full time job and just playing this game when i can.. nothing is out of reach, often you can find deals where ppl just want to move a item fast and boom, next thing you know, your BattleFrame is totally unique to you, never seen another one of me (Bimmie) in the game, one of the best things in this game by far..\n\nsorry, tried to make it short..\n----------------------\nSo, lets put it all out there about this game, FireFall MMO..\nfirst, i have over 1300+hrs in games like defiance, played games like D2 & tribes/T2 for over 6+yrs straight, at first i thought this game was a rip off of defiance, but no, this game was in beta way before defiance was even thought of..\n\nthis is not a P2W game in anymeans, unlike a lot of F2p MMO's, you can fully earn and farm for every item in game or that you see in the red 5 store, which is extremely rare, i work full time, so i still find the time to earn my creds in this game..\n\ncreds can be used in the market or turned into red beans which then can buy stuff from Red 5's store, yea no trion worlds or defiance here, everything can be obtained..\n\ngame play: at first game was so, so for me, then i kept playing it for a few hours, once i got a few lvls and felt the speed of my battle frame pick up, i fully enjoyed the game, only thing i wish for is skiing like we had in the tribes series, but the speed of some of the frames, the freedom of open world and flight, you can craft your vehicles needed to travel around the world with..\n\ngame play of this game matches my more intense personality, especially once you unlock some of the perks and certain battleframe cores, like run speed core..\n\nyou have AOE, you have single target dmg, healing, pretty much everything you need to make a complete balanced team play event..\n\nEnd game: there is plenty, but in my case, i dont care to JUST do end game content, i enjoy lvl'n a frame to 40, then you get 10 pilot tokens to unlock a new advanced frame with, or you can just buy the 99$ pack and get them all now, but once you get the hang of the game and how to lvl, it dont take that long to reach 40...\n\nthere is plenty of bosses to fight, you can use thumpers to mine with and gain your resources to craft with or sale your crafts on the market and yes things sale..\n\nits not a stale game, plenty of ppl on daily...\n\nDevs:  never have i played a game where the Devs take control of the enemies and fight us, they have special events which have been pretty much each weekend where they do this and they give out special rewards and unlocks for taking part of these events..\n\nthere is nothing shady about this company at this time, some ppl may complain, like they do in every game (league of legends) about balance, well, red 5 releases patches, they listen to us on the forums and for the most part they make changes according to what will benefit ppl, not just what they, the devs want,,\n\nHear that Trick dempsy & trion worlds? take note other game companies, even though red 5 may not be that big, they are doing alot of things right and they are not being greedy about it..\n\nits that simple to me, i am happy to see a gaming company like this, get tired of other ones who treat us like we are nothing..\n\ngood job with this FREE, yes, F2p, NOT P2W MMO by Red 5... 20/10 will continue to support these guys..","September 30, 2014","true","937.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's a solid MMO FPS.  It is quite honestly what you expect when you hear those terms combined.  It's not only playable, it's replayable and enjoyable.  It's absolutely not pay-to-win, and everything in the game can be acquired simply by investing time and energy - not cash.  It really doesn't even take too much time to get what you want with in-game credits, either.  Play the game, never spend a dime, and invest in unlocking all the cool stuff you want for your character.\n\nThe neat part is that all "classes" are played from your one character - you swap your "Battleframe", or powered armor suit, and you're a new class.  No logging our and changing characters, no stashing stuff in a storage and mailing things between people.  Everything in one place, just your character the way you want it any day any time.  (Yes, you can change your appearance and even sex at any time, too)\n\nThe in-game community is great.  It's not filled with trolls constantly ♥♥♥♥♥ing at everyone else and calling everyone names for no reason.  The players help each other out when questions are asked, and much like Guild Wars 2 mechanics it's core gameplay is set up so that even if someone attacks or kills your target they're only helping you.\n\nPlay the game for what it it, not what it was in Alpha and Beta.  It's streamlined and easier to understand what stats mean (World of Warcraft stats crunch, anyone?).","September 30, 2014","true","163.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Don't let the time on my record fool you, I played this for a while before it released on Steam, so I have closer to 50 hours playing this game. Anyway, let's get into the pros and cons.\n\nPROS:\n\n\n- Combat is a lot of fun\n\n- The jetpack makes this game differ from other games, with you using it more than any games I can name off the top of my head\n\n- Playing co-op with friends and blasting through the Chosen is fun no matter what level you do it at\n\n- Great customer service\n\n- Their battleframe system is unique\n\n- Even the so called "medics" are very powerful\n\n- This game is truely free to play, with every item in the game being craftable for free, and without paying money\n\n- The developers are very active in creating new events to change things up\n\n-  Even though there are micropurchases,you are not getting them shoved in your face every five minutes.\n\nCONS:\n\n\n- NPCs aren't memorable\n\n- There is no quest log that you can use to abandon a quest\n\n- Lack of a clear direction can be confusing to new players\n\n- You have to grind a lot\n\n- Crafting times and matierals are ridiculous\n\n\nWhile it may look as if the game is bad, trust me it isn't. On paper it may not sound that good, but once you play the game, it works. I definitely recommend getting this game, especially with it being free to play.","September 28, 2014","true","22.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

That just goes to show you that you shouldn't always follow the majority.\n\nThis is the most fun i've had in a shooter in years. That's the keyword here... fun.\n\nYes, the game's buggy. There have been some awful immersion-ruining moments that I have personally experienced, a large number of times. However, the game has been behaving itself for the most part, and the issues i've run into have had some pretty easy to figure out workarounds.\n\nYes, the game is not beautiful. It looks like a slightly blockier version of Planetside 2 with some really downright weird looking character models at times.\n\nYes, the PvP is weird (that's the only word I can use to describe it)\n\nYes, the voice acting is corny. At the same time, it's really charming once you get used to it. The characters and their corny dialog/voice acting just sort of starts to grow on you.\n\nBut none of that mattered to me. The game was easy to follow. The mechanics were easy to learn. The classes, though not distinguishable at first glance, has a nice big icon over each player that shows you what they are. All of the game's flaws were overshadowed by the fact that I just had so much fun playing this game.\n\nI don't like the thought that the Video game industry rates gems like this so poorly while continuing to give high marks to the usual shooter excrement that comes out every year and never changes the formula.

It is anything but that now, as it seems like its turning into a cookie cuter version of Guildwars 2. so they went for organic to mechanic. Good job on the beta, but now there is so many things missing and the reallity of its making the game easier instead of making the game that they said they would Create.","August 24, 2014","true","266.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"
