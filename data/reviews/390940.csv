This could be a positive if you've overplayed all those other games and want a challenge. Or it could be a negative if you want a relaxing game that never lets you paint yourself into a corner.\n\nPersonally, I'm not fond of the art style (especially since it makes it hard to tell where the paths are). But tastes vary, so judge for yourself.","March 26","true","135.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The core loop is simple â€“ You want to get from Point A to Point B and you have a mini-objective along the way. Clear the path to your end goal by gathering resources and clearing obstacles. Obstacles cost resources to clear. Spend resources to build buildings that give you more resources.\n\nThe game gradually introduces more mechanics as you go (crafting, inventory items you can equip for bonuses, boosts, etc)\nThe levels and objectives are varied, the story is simple but sweet, and the music and sound FX are enjoyable.\n\n10/10 Recommended","August 24, 2015","true","4.8"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","11","18","2","0"

I also liked how simple the plot is as well. Although for anyone who wants to play this game it requires a lot of patience and time. the only thing thats sucks is that if you do one simple mistake you have to restart.","October 2, 2015","true","23.9"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","6","12","0","0"

It's not super challenging but definitly not too easy either.  You do have to be careful of how/when you use your resources because if not you will get halfway through a level and realize you have to start that level over because you mismanaged.  Fun game!","October 12, 2015","true","24.7"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","4","8","0","0"

Nice to see these kinds of games on Steam. If you enjoy a thinking type game here and there grab this, Ive been enjoying it even with the "Oh crap, 20 minutes in and I messed up...lol "","August 22, 2015","true","36.5"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","9","19","2","0"
