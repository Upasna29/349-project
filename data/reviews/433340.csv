Over 60,000$, fully upgraded everything. I could pump out 200+ plorts in a day no problem. The stock market had crashed with how much I sold and it had gotten to the point where I had three silos filled to the brim with plorts and I didn't have enough patience to sell them. Eventually churning out plorts gets boring. So I released most of my slimes, and now I keep four slimes in each cage, name them, keep them well fed with their favourite foods. I even feed the local slimes outside my home if I have time.\n\nOne day I was going about business when I saw a pink slime had wandered into my farm (I don't keep pink slimes, I find them annoying) Now, ten days prior I would have fired him straight into the sea to see the rest of his murdered family, but he was so bouncy and I was a somewhat of a Slime Activist now, so let him live.\nDays past. Weeks. I get attached to the slime, naming him Wanderer. I feed him a balenced diet of chickens, fruits and veggies. I swear he loved me! Sometimes he jumped on my head and he would follow me around as I fed the other slimes.\nDay 33 dawns like any other day. I get up and do my daily duties. Wanderer is hopping around and I throw some carrots at him for breakfast. I leave after my chores to get some fresh water for the puddle slimes and I come back with some pogo fruits for him. As I round the corner I see him hopping towards me. But, unbeknownst to him the Exchange machine was online and asking for pink slimes. I see his smiling face coming towards me, and I readied my gun to shoot the pogo fruit for him to catch when  *poof* he's gone. Wanderer vanished. I look at the Exchange machine's screen and it says, "1/12 Pink Slimes"\nHe had ♥♥♥♥ing sacrificed himself to the Exchange machine in his doglike haste to greet me.\nI was frozen in shock for a good three minutes before I quit the game. I haven't been on it since.\nRIP Wanderer.

I checked the game out briefly, but quickly went back to other stuff as it did not really peek my interest. The game seemed a little bit weird to me (as in: it looks boring and stupid) and I was about sure I wouldn't enjoy it. About a week later, I saw one of my favourite youtubers play it and decided to eventually give it a watch. The video was over before I knew it and I clicked on the next one. And the next. After a while it was clear to me: I want this game! NOW! There was just something about it that I can't really describe, but it drew me in. And a lot of other people got drawn in too. It's like a disease being spread, the only difference being that it's a good disease. I admit I've been a little bit too quick in my (wrongful) judging of this game, and will therefore give it a (fair) second chance in this review.\n\nYou play as Beatrix LeBeau who decides to leave earth and set out for the Far, Far Range; a magical and adorable planet filled with slimes! Your goal? Finding slimes to Suck up their plorts (aka slime poop) with your VAC to ... sell them! Yes, correct. Plorts come in many forms and are used for various things on earth; mainly food and products (eww!). You sell these plorts on the plort market to earn some cash, which can then be spend on upgrades (for either yourself or the ranch). When slimes are fed, they'll leave one of these treasures behind for you, or two even if you are lucky. As of now, there are 3 main categories of food: fruits, veggies and meat. Each category has different types of food for you to find and feed to your slimes. If you so desire, you can also plant your own food - you'll run out less slowly (and it's fun too!). Believe me, your slimey friends will be thankful if you do. It is especially useful to plant your friends' favourite food; they'll love you for that and will definitely return the favour via plorts! I hope it is now clear that plorts are extremely valuable and so is your task as slime rancher.\n\nThe gameplay, however a bit unoriginal (find slimes --> feed slimes --> get plorts --> get money --> get upgrades etc) is very satisfying. Finding new slimes is always exciting, especially since you can create mixed breeds that are more efficient for money making (and they are just so adorable too!). The game thus encourages you to explore the planet on your 'quest' to find more and different slimes, find food and start your own farms ... and getting upgrades will make all of that easier. Be careful though, not everything is peaceful on the Far, Far Range. Under certain circumstances, a Tarr slime will come out and devour all the slimes in the vicinity - even you! So be cautious and take good care of your 'pets'!\n\nThe 'thing' that makes Slime Rancher so much fun for me, is the fact that there is so much freedom as to how you play. You can approach this game in a very casual way, and just go on an adventure, enjoying the different and beautiful areas with their inhabitant slimes (I could see this game used for therapy so to speak). The total opposite would be finding the most profitable slimes, combining them, putting them in a corral and making a lot of money - a dream for people who want to create a very efficient farm (or ranch rather). Or you could go inbetween and do a little of both: enjoy the slimes in their natural surroundings, but take a few home to take care of because they're so darn cute! The game is also suited for all ages, which is great. I'm pretty sure both young and old will find a certain joy playing this game and I love it for that. I could totally see a grandfather and his grandchild play this game together having a lot of fun.\n\nThe game in its current state is already super fun and stable, with minimal bugs. I estimate about 5-10 hours of content. There is still a lot of content waiting to be added, like more slimes, more types of food, more areas ... more everything! I also hope that they will add different 'modes' besides the "do-whatever-you-want" experience. I think it would make for much more replayability, which is what I'm looking for in the long run. I want to be able to play this cute game for a long time, without it getting tedious, hence my idea for different modes. (Ofcourse, this list is totally personal, and I will still love this game if it keeps up development like this - whether there be different modes or not). I'm thinking about:\nA story mode: right now there is a little bit of background in the form of mail that you receive, but I think playing through a real story would be pretty amazing. Maybe one where you have to save the slimes from evil or something? I don't know, maybe I'm just babbling nonsense, but I think some kind of story would make things even more interesting.\nChallenge mode: Think about having to complete certain objectives in a certain amount of days. That way, players would have to make smart use of the day-night cycle.\nSandbox mode: The current mode (aka do what you want)\nPros and Cons\n\n+ Unique concept\n+ Relaxing and/or challenging\n+ Nice, soothing soundtrack\n+ Satisfying gameplay\n+ Excellent tutorial\n+ Gorgeous looking world\n+ Cuteness overload!\n\n+- (this is temporary): lack of content\n+- (this is temporary): some may find it a little bit too expensive in its current state\n- The gameplay is not very innovative (as in: get slimes -> get money -> get upgrades -- repeat)\n\nI will revisit this review when the game is fully released, as to edit it accordingly\n\nThe Verdict\n\nI definitely recommend this game, but please keep in mind that it is still early access. Not all the content is in the game yet, and weird stuff (buggs) may happen. If you don't mind that, by all means, please support the devs. Otherwise, just wait a couple of months for the game to be a little bit more polished.\n\nPolite criticism is always appreciated (especially when downvoting)!","January 22","true","9.3"," 421 of 446 people (94%) found this review helpful 57 people found this review funny","94","421","446","57","22"

I really liked the way it looked so I bought it.\nFirst few minutes i was getting used to the controls, doing the tutorial. Seemed easy enough; Though the one thing is, is that having too many slimes in one carrol is hard to do/ hard to take care of them all at once.\nKnowing this, I take care of as many slimes as I can handle. When I came across the cat slime, I was going so crazy over it; but then, it ate a pink slime's poop thingy [Plorts] (I can't believe I already forget it) and it turned into a big pink kitty! There was also these rocky spike slimes; they are adorable... but hurt you. ;u;\nI took care of the kitty with my other slimes but kept it outside. Then... I discovered the tarr. A really messed up slime that you cannot absorb or keep; well because it's evil. I had to throw them into the sea so i could easily destroy them. Then i found out i could take water and shoot it at them till they died or put them into water. Where is when i found boom slimes. Well they explode; that's pretty much it, but they have a good worth of newbucks(?).\nThere are different slimes and they can all combine into a largo which is a big slime that is both of the slimes through eating the [plorts] poop stuff.\n0.25\nGraphics and music update!\nThe music transitions very nicely between areas keeping an alike theme, making it feel like you are actually going places. Alot of lighting difference with slimes and the ground. Water texture is a bit too blue but i get the point it's supposed to be fresh water. Geysers look fantastic, slime sea has seaweeds now and a bit of a tint change.\nIn all 0.25 is very beautiful.\n\n\nSince this game is an early access there is alot more to come to this, so bear in mind i shall update this review over time.\n\nTl;dr\nThe game is wonderful, you should buy it because it's really fun.","January 25","true","16.2"," 366 of 395 people (93%) found this review helpful 90 people found this review funny","93","366","395","90","5"

Well... it's what slimes do when they gorge themselves on tasty food provided by the environment or by yours truly. Ok, I will stop beating around the bush and say it - it's slime poop that various corporations buy from you to turn into different products. So pretty much everything in this game revolves around poop, and while that might be offensive to some people, never forget that humanity is very much based on poop - mainly because we breathe the stuff that the trees across the world poop every second. Who needs that worthless oxygen when all the good stuff is carbon-based :D\n\nSo, let's see what this game does well and what poorly.\n\nTHE GOOD:\n\n1. An extremely relaxing, non-invasive music that perfectly fits the atmospehere.\n2. The game gives you this zen feeling that makes you wonder just when did those 2-3 hours pass while you were having heaps of fun.\n3. The world is cartoonish and quite pleasant to look at.\n4. A good amount of areas for you to explore, and way more to come, with a few of them already programmed, but not yet populated and unlocked.\n5. Adorable slimes of different colors for you to herd, feed and even cross-breed, making all kinds of cute sounds that easily put a smile on your face.\n6. Casual gameplay that is extremely easy to pick up and just have fun.\n7. You cannot lose the game - which is a great touch for a fun casual game.\n8. Exploration is very rewarding, with many hidden areas for you to discover.\n9. A rather big and expansive ranch at this stage of developent with plenty of building spots for corals, ponds, chicken coops or gardens.\n10. Cross-breeding slimes is totally doable and gives you different outcomes with new animations and needs that add another level of cuteness to the game.\n11. Early access done right - I can foresee this game getting glowing recommendations by everyone. That's how you do early access - you pack your game with a good amount of content, provide an engaging gameplay and then ship it to steam.\n12. Tons of achievements for you to unlock and strive for.\n13. Jetpacks: intrepid explorers can even use them to get to locked areas or places the developers never intended you to go, which is always fun.\n14. Controller support is available, should you choose to play with one.\n\nOk, now let's take a look at the BAD:\n\n1. While the ranch is big, the plots at this point of development are in fixed locations, which may be off-putting to people who want to squeeze max effectiveness.\n2. While the ranch is big, the plots are ultimately not enough if you want to have every slime type and subsequently, cross-breed of slime in the game and the food needed to feed them.\n3. There is no story to speak of, and even if not really necessay in my opinion, may turn a few people off the game.\n4. At this stage of development, you will be looking at about 10 hours of gameplay to do everything and finish the content.\n5. A price tag that is off-putting - the game costs 20€ for me, and while I am 100% sure that I will get my value for the money, it's too much for a good number of people - both for financial reasons, or because it's still an early access, and pledging 20€ to an early access game is always a risk.\n6. No steam cloud yet - so if you happen to be using two separate PC's to play Slime Rancher (like me, but I only discovered it today), you need to manually transfer your saves for now. Hopefully it will be resolved in the future.\n\nTHE CONCLUSION:\nI wholeheartedly recommend this game to everyone who enjoys cute open-end games with decend amount of exploration that promote casual gameplay and put a smile on your face. The amount of content and the adorable world you are put in at start are part of the strong selling points to this game. What sets it back for now is the limited amount of plots to build in order to enjoy the full experience and the number of locked areas with an "under construction" sign, which you need to wait for a bit to get populated.\n\nTo me, even at the current price tag, Slime Rancher is a good purchase. You can't put value on good feelings and smiles, and anything or anyone (!) who lets you have them in throves, is priceless :)","January 14","true","16.1"," 252 of 265 people (95%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","95","252","265","35","13"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/armani8/recommended/433340/","armani8","Armani","http://steamcommunity.com/id/armani8/","331 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAdore the game for what it is: a lighthearted, beautiful romp into a silly farming simulator. Then again, I also adore the Rune Factory franchise, so its really a matter of taste.\n\nNow why do I like it you might ask? Well theres 5 things in particular I liked.\n\n1) Its fun to make a farm and get money. Its been fun for ages actually, oddly enough. Ever since Harvest Moon, and then to Rune factory, I've liked the whole farming/economy simulator type games. Were they a bit repetive? Yup. Did they manage to let me unwind and work at regular challenges and tasks? Yes, and as odd as it sounds its quite fun.\n\n2) The game is adorable. They have a cat slime. That you can mutate with several other genus (?) of slimes. That also somehow makes them larger. Why is that? Because its adorable, thats why. And the cat slime isn't even the cutest one.\n\n3) You get a vacuum cleaner gun. Color me biased, its fun to use and I flipping loved Luigi's Mansion.\n\n4) Upgrades feel meaningful. Early on, your pretty strapped for cash. Get some money? Neato, time to upgrade that pen with a Solar shield so the Phosphors don't disintigrate at daybreak (like vampires). Got some Phosphors? They can fly, ya'll need a higher wall. Got a solar shielded, giant walled corral? They are hungry, grow them some food. And so on. Money is not impossible to come by (far from it), and makes life a lot easier for you in noticable bounds with every penny you pour back into your farm. Higher walls offer more containment, fertile soil grows plants faster, silo upgrades give you more space. Also almost every upgrade has a asthetic associated with it. Thats quality right there.\n\n5) Its a game that just wants to be a game. Honestly its a real problem nowadays with economic styled games - they force you to suffer until you can get better off. And I don't mind that, in fact I enjoy that in Rune Factory and Harvest Moon. Working to get your feet off the ground and be successful with less work isn't just fun, its actually basically the most human desire I can think of in gaming (besides sex). And this game is hard at the beginning to get off the ground. But getting off the ground is fun, and its not ever a grind to do it. Jetpack? Buy it in 1 day, easily. Ranch upgrades? Each one might be expensive, but the essentials are incredibly easy to get. The game lets you have fun with it, and it feels like a real game the entire time.\n\n\nEasily a 7/10 right now, and personally thats likely to go up if they continue working on it at a good pace. A lighthearted gem of a farming sim. Not a ton of content, I'd probably benchmark it at about 5 hours of genuine game content (not counting getting the farm up to speed) as of right now.\n\n\nEDIT (As of May 22, 2016):\n\nWanted to make a quick note about the development of the game for those who are interested. The development team for this game is (from what I've gathered) rather small, and as a result development is rather slow. That being said, its actually not so bad. The game gets regular updates (roughly every 3 to 5 weeks), and each update adds something concrete. Still a very happy recommendation of a very playable game.","January 18","true","5.0"," 171 of 177 people (97%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","97","171","177","21","0"

Every night I locked them up and made sure they'd get fed with fruits and veggies. I had just started a chicken coop the same day and had a decent number of about five or six chickens. I slept during the night knowing tomorrow I'll need to round a few stragglers up. In my coop sits one Pink Tabby Largo, smiling and staring at me. Upset I move him back to a pen and leave him and continue my day. I head to bed making sure everyone is locked up and very well fed, ensuring not one slime can get my new chickens. Sure enough the next day there sits the same slime smiling, the only one to escape was him. At this point I'm a bit scared so I create a solitary confinement for him and lock it down tight. I replenish my coop and head to bed worried. The next day I return to see this slime, out of solitary confinement and in my coop, smiling after eating all my chickens for the third time. He now lives in the coop and feeds of the sacrifices I deliver to him and he smiles at me each morning from his feast. This evil creature has been named now and I fear the wrath of Squishers.","February 16","true","6.0"," 118 of 127 people (93%) found this review helpful 172 people found this review funny","93","118","127","172","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EmilyPawpaw/recommended/433340/","EmilyPawpaw","Emily","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EmilyPawpaw/","339 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis is a Review written for Version 0.2.4b, it may be updated at a later point, like the game itself.\nLet's assume, since their second version numbers are the "content" updates, that the game is around 20% done so far.\n\nI can say this after my first... roughly 4 hours:\n\nGraphics: Bright, Colourful, Cartoony and even in dark areas it's cheerful, rather than gloomy.\nHard to comment on it, since it's not for everyone. I personally like it, but that's just me,\nin fact, it's what drew my attention to the game. It's very visually appealing to me.\nThough, you'll have to see for yourself. If you like the way it looks in the screenshots,\nit certainly won't disappoint you.\n\nSound Design: While the slimes' squeaks are rather adorable and the "totally tense suspense music" pops in each time danger is around,\nit does get repetitive after a while of playing. It did not stick with me either, so either it's not too repetitive or not very memorable. This may just be the only actual criticism I have though and it might certainly change over time.\nHowever: The sounds besides the background music are pretty clearly indicating when something is around. The Squishing of slime or "Bawk bawk bawk"ing of chickens helps very much should you e.g. look for chickens in tall grass.\n\nGameplay: It's exactly what you think it is: You catch slime, feed them, they produce the goods you can sell, you do so and move on. Your Stats and Abilities can also be upgraded with said money, making the aforementioned process a bit easier.\nLet me move the negative-ish things out of the way first:\nIf you wish to plant both fruits and veggies in your garden though, and your slimes only eat fruit, your veggies don't really go anywhere. I guess you can always take them with you and feed wild slimes, but I didn't see much point in that either, but since there is no way to sell them either, they just use up Silo space instead. Maybe I'll have slimes that like veggies at some point and then I'm happy I kept them, I don't know.\nAnother minor annoyance would be wild slimes getting in your way as you try to collect ... pretty much anything. Especially the big slimes will get in your way. A lot. Though.. that's really as far as it goes.\nRespawn rates might also be a little bit.. unbalanced currently, seeing that I got about 50 Chickens within 3 minutes taking a tour through the Garden part of the Ranch after buying it. That's not really a complaint because it's very helpful if you need meat, but it might just make everything a little bit too easy.\nNow the good things:\nBesides my minor complaints here and there I had a looooot of fun. It's relaxing and the whole exploration aspect makes finding something new, something interesting much more rewarding, even more so when a pop up informs you what you even got/did just now, yes, there are ingame Achievements.\nFor the sake of not spoiling anything (since you don't really read reviews after getting and playing the game, now do you?) I can't really say what I enjoyed the most, but it was great. Really great.\n\nAnd for an Early Access title? This is how it should be. It's playable, I didn't encounter any bugs and it's a lot of fun.\n\nI'm pretty sure it's not a game that'll die either, this will be finished over time and it will only get better,\nand knowing that, I can wholeheartedly recommend it, if anything you've already seen on the store page appeals to you.","January 27","true","5.0"," 108 of 114 people (95%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","95","108","114","8","0"

Every now and then one will break out and get a small taste of freedom and feast on the plentiful gardens you've worked so hard to plant. At which point you have a choice, you can either throw it back in its box, or throw it into the ocean and listen to its grasp for air. (Not really, but I like to imagine it)\n\nSlime Rancher looks like it’s going to be an incredibly fun game. Catching slimes, growing gardens, and exploration make this game very addicting. The game is really short right now, and I only got about 2 hours of gameplay out of it before I had caught all the slimes and built everything there is to build. But that’s expected with it being an early release.

It's still quite new in early access, so at the time of this review the game still feels very bare-bones and hopefully that will be fixed with future additions.\n\nThe core gameplay idea is interesting. Slimes can absorb the "plorts" other slimes make after they eat and become a larger hybrid slime of the two types. You can also collect and sell these for upgrades to both yourself and your slime corrals (and you can also build a few different buildings). Also, there's a "stock market" with different prices each day on different types of slime plorts, which forces you to diversify, since they are unique to each type of slime, and it also encourages you to make lucrative slime hybrids of two high-value types since hybrid slimes give plorts of both their constituent types.\n\nIn my opinion it could either become a really great game if they keep adding interesting things to it or a really bad game if they just take their money and run. I feel like the game could stand to use a lot more land for slimes and exploration as it is now, but being early access it could either happen or not happen at this stage.","February 10","true","5.2"," 62 of 71 people (87%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","87","62","71","7","0"

Surprised?  Your home-base is a ranch with a house and several empty plots of land.  Your goal is hunt slimes, suck them up with your vaccuum pack, then take them home and take care of them.\n\nWhy?  Because slime poop is very valuable, of course!\n\nWhen slimes eat, they 'poop' little crystals called Plorts.. you can trade these Plorts in for money.. then use that money to expand your ranch, transform plots of land into corrals, coops, gardens, storage units, etc, and buy upgrades to make yourself a more effective slime rancher.\n\nYou can raise chickens, grow crops, feed your slimes, and explore the world for new and exciting things, all in a physics-enabled First-Person adventure, with your trusty vaccuum pack to manipulate the world around you.  Slimes can also be bred to create new types of slimes for bigger profits.  Just be careful, because combining the wrong types of slimes can be dangerous!  I warned you!\n\nSo far, an excellent game.  Could perhaps use a little more content, but the developers are still adding new environments, more slimes and more resources, so I have confidence that my wishes will be fulfilled. You should at least wishlist this game and keep an eye on it.\n\nPros:\n-Beautiful graphics (as long as you don't hate bright, cartoony visuals)\n-Fun and vairied gameplay.\n-Appropriate for younger players, and still fun for older players.\n-Very stable for an Early Access game.  No crashes, and no major bugs for me so far.\n\nCons:\n-Could use more content, but that's being worked on!\n-Wish I could somehow specify I want to pick up with vaccuum pack.  It can be a little frustrating to be collecting plorts, and end up picking up a lot of slimes and other stuff in the process.  This is a minor gripe.. you can always drop stuff you don't want.","January 14","true","1.3"," 55 of 62 people (89%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","89","55","62","6","0"

This release (I am on 0.2.4b) had two expansions on the ranch (thankfully, I was worried when I started really getting into the game).\nI also love profit.  This game had a satisfying method of cross breeding that helps maximize income.\n\nThe world is well designed and I didn't experience any common issues you would find in early access games like crashes or 'stuck in the floor/wall' issues.\n\nAs long as the content updates keep coming, this game can be replayed again and again.

The role as caretaker for these slimes is really nice, and understanding how mating them gives advantages and disadvantages is the meat of the game. Sadly, its a short meal, and not a very fullfilling one. The game is good however, and if you have a few hours to waste, this is a nice timewaster. And thats exactly what it is; a waste of time.\n\nIts only in beta 0.3 when I write this tho, and there seems to be areas yet in development. I wish the game would focus more on caretaking and not exploring in future updates, as managing the slimes is the most fun part. Hopefully there will be more evolution and mating, and perhaps some hidden slime you have to r&d before you can get to the next parts.\n\nAnd thats what I want from this game, explore the side effects of mating, and perhaps even bad mating?\n\n6/10+, the game is a reminder to startups how simple the writing can be, and the product still be entertaining, so I recommend it.","January 17","true","4.5"," 56 of 73 people (77%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","77","56","73","4","0"

You feed them, protect them from the evil tar slimes, clean up after them and even shelter some, it's amazing and they can even warm the coldest of hearts with their smiling faces! These little slimes are so innocent and pure....\n\nBut then the money starts rolling in from their magical little poos. Money really is the root of all evil especially in this game. I have done terrible things...COMPLETELY ♥♥♥♥ED UP THINGS! I have literally been taken over by the dark side, I am so ashamed! In the beginning, when tar slimes attacked, I screamed "NO! YOU WILL NOT EAT THESE BABY SLIMES, YOU ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S!" and would save them all! I thought I was a good person but oh how things have changed in the matter of hours. Now, I will just  run right passed them watching them get devoured with the look of horror in their eyes...literally not giving a ♥♥♥♥...When did I become a monster like this?!\n\nNow, let's talk about your ranch. You start out with one coral and some machines. I ended up putting a very special slime in the coral, the 1st slime I caught since he was the cutest of all, I was so inlove with this little cat slime, I even named him Catrick Swayze. Everything was great at the start, Catrick ate the food I fed him and he was so happy. I was making a little money off his tabby stripped poop, things were great. I knew Catrick would eventually get lonely, so I decided to put this little pink slime named Ditto in the corral with him, they got along so well and even combined their awesomeness to make a Pink Catricks....so cute! Now I was making even more money with the pink poos and the tabby ones, so I decided to upgrade the corral to give my babies the best corral ever with a music box, auto feeder, higher walls and polort sucker to keep the cage clean! I'm such a good mommy! Why stop there I thought...the more the merrier right? In a matter of 15 mintues, I had about 15 Catricks stuffed in a little box, I swear you could hear the muffled screams...If only I cared enough to put a stop to this madness!  But they looked so happy and I was happy too with all this money! MORE CORRALS I thought as I twirled my Snidely Whiplash looking mustache in between my fingers. Within an  hour, I had about 9 corrals filled to the brim with all kinds of  unfortunate slimes. When I was on the hunt for more slimes, let's say an undesirable slime crossed my path, I would not hesitate to suck up the little slime in my vacuum gun and look them dead in the eyes as I shot them off a cliff into the water below...never to resurface again. I even resorted to personally feeding the slimes that explode to the tar slimes, just because I could! I AM A TERRIBLE PERSON!\n\nOne may wonder, How do you go about feeding so many slimes that all have different diets...Well It started out innocent enough, I would personally go pick the food for my slime babies, whatever their little hearts desired! I'm assuming it was Organic of course, only the best for my slimes! I would even go into the corral and feed them myself (have I mentioned, Im a good mommy?). They tend to eat a lot so I grew my own garden which was all funded from their poo money.  At this point, I had unlocked a new area and discovered more types of slimes, these slimes brought way more money in than Pink Catrick Swazyes, so I rounded up my first ever slimes and threw them all to their death off the cliff, I was a business woman now and couldn't be bothered with traveling to release slimes back into the wild. These new money makers were meat eaters, so I had to invest into chicken coops. I no longer had the time to go out into the wild to find hens to bring back to my ranch. Chickens are pretty easy to find and reproduce fast so I began having an over load of chickens on my ranch but I found a simple solution to this problem...Silos. I literally have a Silo filled with 100's of chickens all alive on the inside! So not only am I factory farming silmes, I'm doing the same with chickens now....As I said I am a business woman now, I literally force these hens to lay eggs until they are elders  and then feed them to the slimes. I feel I should mention, I no longer feed each slime myself, I just put their meals into a machine and let it do the job. If a slime doesn't get a meal, I hold no responsibility...surivial of the  fittest mother ♥♥♥♥er!\n\n\nI turned into a monster about 3 hours into the game but with all this said 10/10 would factory farm slimes again just for their ♥♥♥♥...literally.","February 12","true","20.3"," 29 of 31 people (94%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","94","29","31","35","4"

This game is such a gem, IMHO.\n\nBasically, you are on a far away planet and you decide to run a 'ranch' (or "range :) ) to make a living. In order to earn a bit of money, you need to  wander around a beautiful 'cartoonish" environment, populated with different kind of slimes, and feed these slimes with local food you can find (or grow). You can take these slimes back to your ranch in order to have them at hand, in special areas called "corral" that you can expand and/or upgrade with more money.\nAlternatively, you can also decide not to make any money at all and just play around with the many many slimes roaming in the big wild world :) ; oh..and, you can have a jetpack for easy travel !  (still reading ? )\n\nNo 'game over', if you die, you come back at the 'ranch', just loosing what was in your "vac pack".\nDie, you might say ??  Yes, some slimes are dangerous and must be handled carefully :D, and you can also die if you fall in the sea surrounding the whole land. There are also some more dangerous things out there in the far far 'ranch' but I let you discover that by yourself.\n\nThe music is nice and catchy.\n\nThe story is not the main focus in the game, but if you take the time to read the informations about the land and the creatures (infos found in a handy menu called "slimepedia" :D ) you will see that the devs have a nice sense of humor.\n\nThe game is currently in early access, but already offers a lot to do/play around. I can't wait to see what the full game will be like. It took me around 15 hours to explore all the game had to offer back in the first build, before they added more areas and more slimes ! The updates are not very often (so far) but have a lot of content and/or fix.\nThe devs are friendly and welcome every feedback/reports. (seriously, still reading ? )\n\nIf you like playing with very cute things that you constantly want to hug, buy this game !! :)\n\nAnd again... a BIG thank you to the devs for making such a gem.\n\nNeed to go ! My puddle slimes are throwing each other all over the place, thinking they are a frisbee.\n","May 18","true","20.8"," 26 of 28 people (93%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","93","26","28","8","0"

They remind me of a Poring, Nekoring, etc(ring) from Ragnarok Online, which why I have bought this game. It's simple as it is:\n1) You are a famer abducting slimes from their homes\n2) Sell their coloring, gooey poop for money! What a strange sensation!\n3) Run around exploring avaliable worlds and slimes!\n4) Cuteness of the slimes, especially those Cat slimes. <3 They jump on your face like a derpbag you are.\n5) Find tard and spit him to the ocean. Way to go, slugger!\nLast and at least, it's a fun time consuming game. Whenever  you are bored from other games you just finished, come play this to hunt down a very special thing: the Golden Slime! Little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s runs away the speed of light the minute you take a feet in. Anyways, it's very enjoyable, relaxing and stress-free.

So regarding the price, you're getting your money's worth.\n\nSo summerize what you do in the game: you play in first person with a vacuum gun, you suck in slimes and food for them, you spit them out in your ranch and keep feeding them by planting and growing food to have them produce gems for you to sell and get money and get yourelf upgrades, and you continue on doing this. You can also combine different types of slimes to get a new type of slime.","January 14","true","1.9"," 24 of 34 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","24","34","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Emsy-Tf2/recommended/433340/","Emsy-Tf2","Emsychando :3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Emsy-Tf2/","30 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nTime for another 8000 character review because that is just how I role when I do reviews out of bordem(Yes I litterly take the time to count all 8000 characters, thats how bored I get. But I stopped that bordem for a while with this fantastic game though). Would recommend for 20 bucks. So many things to do like grab a bunch of boom slimes and have a micheal bay simulator or grab a bunch of water nad have a tarr zombie outbreak and such. If you don't do anything other than grabbing slime to make cash you can probably run out of wahys to make cash about 3 hours but if you do some other crappy stuff like drown 5 million pink slimes into the ocean or make fire works with boom slimes it can defintley keep you gooked for quite a while. not to the mention the facts that there are many mods to. Slime rancher is like one of those like mobile app games where you work for the sole pupose of making your work easier. Which is kinda cool for a pc game that you can get on steam and carry everywhere with you. You grab slimes, put them into containment corrals and then feed them. You can force them to eat eachother's poop to become hybrids[10/10 best genetics simulator 2016]or you can sell them for cash to upgrade their containment corrals or buy food producing areas such as coops(Meat as in the chicken) or gardens(as in fruits and vegetables). And the point fo upgrading their containment corrals and upgrade their farms and coops or buy farms and coops is to well, make even more cash to do it over and over. It's a pretty addicing thing until you run out of space or types of slime to contain. Which is about the only complaint I have about this game and nothing else. It's that you can finish the game quite quickly and there isin't that much of a variety of things to do once you've explored everything and done side stuff such as forcing puddle slimes to walk on land. After 6 hours in the game I had a spare slime key and 60k newbucks.I understand that it's in early acess and that it's still kind of new but it still saddens me that it's so short before you go out and say "I'm bored now."(<---NOT CALLING IT BORING. IT'S REALLY FUN!!! AND I RECOMMEND GETTING IT! IT'S THE VARIETY OF THINGS TO DO THAT MAKES ME WONDER) Otherwise, running out of things to do this is by far the best pc cute simulator. It's rare to see cute simulators on steam with major shooting games running around and sucking up everyon's cash(borderlands,tf2,cs:go,saints row, gta, and other stuff). If you're the one to love cutness and you have a pretty decent income coming to your household I'd highly recommend this game for you! The cute slimes aren't the only thing that amazed me. The scenary and the smooth and beutiful world makes it very entertaing to explore and has an endless feel of lushious forrests to it. Not a single place have I looked at and went "Eh cool" more like "Wow! How'd they do that?". There isin't much danger other than angry hungry largos that appear or rock/boom/tarr slime that roam, so you can defintley enjoy the scenary. *COUGHS* You might get knocked into the ocean by some b.s way every now and then *COUGHS*. Some things that I'd like to see the creators add to slime rancher is the radiation slime. For a while now the creators have taunted us with showing us the radiation slime in the main menu and making it aviable to sell their green plorts, despite it being impossible to even get their plorts.(Worth about as much as honey,boom,or pond slime's plorts so I guess they'll most likley appear somewhere in the jungle area like the other slimes that are in its range price.) I saw a youtube video that put a mod in that was able to spawn them and the guy like made hybrids of every rad slime there is and it seemed that there was nothing wrong with the slimes so why didn't they add them? Theres a hybrid of it for every slime there is(Execpt for tarr,gold,and liquidwaterpondorwhatever slime)Not to mention that in the store page they show us the pickle fruit thingy or is that a vegetable I DON'T KNOW but there is a prickly pineapple? PURPLE LURPLE LURPLE pineapple thingy. That we cannot seem to obtain in the game as said in the wiki the fruit is called. PICKLED PEAR! and yes it's a fruit. Not to mention the oca oca you can find and silver parsnip you can find in the games file. At the moment is impossible to get the achivement that requires us to grow 3 vegetables at once because theres only 2 vegetables in the game. Why do they taunt us with these items by making us aware that they exist but not adding them. Maybe they're planning to add it soon? The world may never now as of this moment but I'd be nice if they added them along with the game seeing how they worked very properly and there was nothing buggy about them. Not that I'm rushing the devolopers to make the next update right now becasue I can't make a better game than this. Before I stop putting random crap about stuff I want I have one last thing to say I want. I want more regions to buy gardens,coops,incernators,silos,ponds,and gardens in. It have at least 2 coops/garden for each corral and it is still difficult to feed all the slime in the corrals because they eat them so much so I live off of depending for their to be more fruit by the end of the day(It's like living and relying off of paycheck by paycheck. One of those situations.) Okay I said I would stop but one more thing that I'd like to see is being able to catch gold slimes. We can't make hybrids of gold slimes sadly and they're already rare, so can they add like a upgrade in the upgrade store thing-a-ma-jigger-jiggy in the upgrade place where you buy jetpack,energy,nano,hp,and sprint stuff. Maybe add a "Gold Slime Catcher" for a crap load of cash and make it so the gold slime won't despawn if we do somehow get them into a corral(Yes, they will despawn after your hard work of launching them kobejordanjamescurry style into your corral. They're already rare enough so at least. All and all it's noy mt right to complain about this game's flaws because I can't do any better in making a game. As we can see with the large amounts of marked off places that are marked off by wooden planks and with a sign of a blue slime with a construction hat on it that they're working on more areas that could possibly contain more foods and more slime. (Like how theres a giant stone place with the slime sign on it near the palce where you find rock slime, that could be the place where you find radiation slime and ocra ocra(RADIATION SLIME'S FAVORITE FOODS(Yes I just used parenthesis inside parenthesis inside parenthesis)). And the 2 regions in the jungle that have the same construction sign could quite possibly lead to more beutiful and lushiously lushious jungles with new slime that perhaps won't radiate you like a grass slime ro something(SLime thats green at the top and brown at the bottom and has grass sticking out of it, tottaly a creative idea and not based off of the minecraft icon of the grass block). Or it could possibly lead to a new area where you can live there instead of living at where you start at and ranch slimes there and build stuff there like corrals and gardens and coops and hav ea whole entire exxchange rate there and 2 areas that you can purchase for 1,500 each (Like the grotto and the overgrtowh) to enter and place even more civlized buildings in. Or maybe 3 so we can say illumnati confirmed or to be different from the orginal 2 and just being more because more is always better right? Like more tarr RIGHT RIGHT? AMIRTIE> Okay back to task on hand. Bassicly theres a lot of future in this game as of this moment despite the low amount of things to do AT THE MOMENT because then again it's just early beta. So I would recommend getting it now because the content thats out right now is still pretty good. And in the future go look at it and go wow so much stuff since I bought it because I know they're working on more stuff right now. So bassicly, JUST BUY THE CUTE SIMULATOR.","February 14","true","26.2"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","83","15","18","12","8"

It looked like a nice peaceful chilled out game.\nThis is partly true, for the most part you will be calmly collecting slimes and food. Farming them for their plorts and making a stack of cash to make farming plorts that much more efficient. However there came a horrible moment for me when I looked at my ranch and thought "I'm doing well here everything is set up nicely". Then cue the slightly creepy music as I turned my back for a moment. Horrible black ooze creatures descended upon my ranch and slowly spread like a virus. Claiming the lives of Chicken and slime alike. Before eventually turning their eyes to me. With my vacuum gun I had only one option to pull in these giant slimes who were too big to pull into a storage tank and then blast them off a cliff to their deaths. After Holding off their attempt on my life I saw the ranch empty. Corrals and coop all silent. It was a cruel moment.\nThe game can be a little light on content for now with it being Early access but in time I feel this game will be a perfect game for those of use that like gathering/farming/collecting. Seeing which slimes you can morph with another is a subject I'm very looking forward to seeing it develop in future.\nIf you don't mind the wait for the game to grow I'd highly recommend it right now. Its fun and very pretty.\nIf Early access is not your thing please at least keep this on your wishlist till the day it leave early access. I doubt you will regret it.","January 20","true","1.6"," 23 of 33 people (70%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","70","23","33","5","0"

It's very fun and very cute.\n\nThat being said, at time of writing I have about 5 hours of total play time. I am at the end-game of Slime Rancher. In its current state, it's fairly easy to get to the end due to lack of content (if you know what you're doing, anyhow). Bare in mind that this is early access and this isn't a bad thing but, unless you REALLY want to play around with cat slimes who boop your nose, you should give it a few updates for the sake of enough content.\n\nSlime Rancher is really fun though. It's pretty interesting coming up with strategies for how you'll get the most valuable plorts and how you'll manage and upgrade your slime farm. There's a lot of stuff to consider. For example, what should you focus on for your slime stock: Getting lots of one kind of slime, or keeping multiple variants? What are the risks of both? You could flood the market with plorts and get much less profit with one way, but the other opens up the possibility of cross-breeding and infection (Largo slimes and Tarr slimes, as I refer to them). And the slimes... oh god, where do I start? They're all very playful and adorable. Everything about them just screams "happy" and that makes me happy too! Keeping them happy is pretty interesting, since every one had different preferences. It's a challenge, for certain. All part of the fun! \ovo/\n\nIt's not without its flaws, of course. I wish there was a way to only suck up one type of object at a time, especially when Largo slimes are around. They should make it so that only an empty slot on your vaccuum gun sucks up everything around while a filled slot only sucks up that particular item. (as an upgrade, I would love this feature). Additionally, Tarr Slimes appear FAR too often in the wild. Whenever I go near a group of three different slime variants, I make bets on how long it will take for them to commit suicide. I understand that there should be an element of danger on the range, but not to the extent that it's this annoying. There should be some sort of system for wild slimes to avoid this eventuality (perhaps domestication or starvation would lead a slime to eat plorts of other species). If anything, Tarr slimes should be slightly less annoying to deal with. Some sort of means to make a bigger impact with a blast of water would be cool - maybe an upgrade to the vac that lets it change into a water-shooting minigun.\n\nThis game is definately worth is, but it needs more development before it's truly worth buying imo. I can't wait to see what other unique twists they add to the far, far range.","February 6","true","8.2"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","12","13","2","0"

That is probably why I have liked it so much. Though, only after playing a little over two hours of the game, Ive unlocked both farm sections, collected almost every slime, fed two of the super-large slimes. I actually think the game needs to be far more difficult so that players get a lot more in-game time to really reach some of these goals. While I havent done everything yet, for what I have done in two hours, I feel like maybe its just a little "too" easy. Other than that, the "farming" aspect is great. I would recommend the game to my friends simply for what fun you can get out of it, and the super adorable slimes you get to collect.

Think games like Rune Factory, Harvest Moon.  Those games are cute, they're interesting, their gameplay is relatively simple and compelling.  Slime Rancher takes all that and blows it out of the water and it's only in pre-alpha!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0VDaaLK4mk\n\nGameplay in Slime Rancher is VERY simple.  You have a vacuum and can suck things into it and shoot things out of it.  Next-gen gravity gun.  You can collect slimes, carrots, and lotsa poop.  Yep, I said poop!  Your main means of earning money in Slime Rancher is by feeding slimes and collecting their poop to sell on the poop market.  Poop.\n\nI'm not joking.  You literally collect their poop and sell it to the poop collectors who turn the poop into all sorts of commodities for humanity including lights, foot, and decoration!\n\nAnd the Slimes are adorable little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.\n\nOn a more serious note, it's been a long time since I've seen such polish on a game that says they're in early alpha.  It's impressive and refreshing.  The art style is gorgeous and there's quite a bit of content already, with more to come.  If you're into the Harvest Moon style of games or you simply love the idea of collecting adorable little slimes and harvesting their poop for your own personal gain (and humanity's) then consider this game!","January 14","true","1.4"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","16","23","0","0"

The graphics are smooth and well made. The game shows promise of more with various "construction" signs placed in the explorable zones. You have a variety of slimes to start off with and a good intro into the game itself, while still having you actually work for it. Now, here's where you can really tell it's early access. I had caught up to the development after playing for a couple of hours (albeit consecutive hours, but still) Once I had my farm going, even after I collected Slime Keys and unlocked other places, I started to find less things to do. I can still mindlessly play this game for a couple of hours but the thing I'm doing the whole time is collecting food to feed my slimes to get plorts - for what? I've already bought all of the upgrades I can. I have every spot occupied. I have nothing left to do.\nI'd love to be able to have more time to explore without feeling like I need to go back and farm in order to keep all of my slimes productive. I already have over 20,000 cash and I don't know what to do with it.\nI made a post in the forms about thoughts for future updates - it's rather long so here's the link if you're curious. http://steamcommunity.com/app/433340/discussions/0/451852118777491443/","January 26","true","14.3"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","7","7","2","0"

However, I was able to gather all resoucres and explore every part of the game in under 5 hours. I had the best slimes and everything upgraded that I needed to profit easily. As of now, I cannot reccomend this game especially for a $20 price point, this would have been an amazing $10 game considering the length. I look forward to updates in the future that will expand the game, but from what I can see, the game will only be implementing a couple new slime, 1 new area, and a couple more food items in the next major update. I don't see this expanding the game much further than another hour, or two hours max. This will unfortunately be one of those games that I keep in my library and reinstall it a year later to see if anything has changed.","January 28","false","6.6"," 241 of 447 people (54%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","54","241","447","16","11"

Here are a few things that I think should be included in and my reasons as to why. I will be making some comparisons to Harvest Moon and Animal Crossing because I think they can help get my point across.\n\nAs of this moment there is no endgame, no larger goal to complete. I explored all that there was to explore at the moment. I currently have Honey Slimes because they can give me the most money the quickest. Upon buying all the upgrades they have so far, upgrading all the farm lands, slime coops, etc. As of this moment, there is nothing else to buy.\n\nI'll compare this to Animal Crossing and the debt on your house that you can pay. In the beginning of Animal Crossing there is already a motivation to earn money. Using that money to pay your debt is up to you, but if you do, you can upgrade your house, put more stuff in it, etc. In Slime Rancher it seems to me that I can use the money that I earn, to earn more money faster. That's great, if there is a bigger goal, but so far not really anything to spend the thousands of coins that I have.\n\nI believe this can be improved by have a debt like Animal Crossing, and everytime you pay the debt a new Ranch opens up somewhere else on the planet or open the new farmland that is attached to your Ranch.\n\nI fail to see the use of combined slimes late game. In the beginning I combined a Tabby Slime and a Pink Slime, this had an advantage in the beginning because Tabby Slimes only ate meat. But now they will eat anything, so that's a good way to get money in the beginning quickly. But once you have a steady supply of "Insert Slime" favorite food. It will produce double the amount of items to sell. It is then more cost effective to just toss the Hybrid Tabby and Pink Slime aside for just Tabby Slimes.\n\nI think that the best way to improve this is to have the Hybrid Slime make a Hybrid Item, because as of right now, the Hybrid Slimes produce one of each. As in a Tabby Pink Hybrid will produce one Tabby Item and one Pink Item. I also think that these Hybrid Items should be used for something else other than just being sold. For instance, there is a Request device where someone will make a request for slimes, slime items, or food and upon completing this request they will send you items in return. However, the payment tended to be food\n\nThis part is going to cover automation of the Ranch and Side Activities. Like I said earlier you can upgrade Slime Coops and Farming Lands to the point where the Coops would automatically feed the slimes and automatically gather the slime items for you. This will free up some time for you to do other things. Sadly, there isn't anyting else to do in the game besides explore, kind of gets boring once you exlpored everywhere, and go after achievements. For Example, in a majority of Harvest Moons your farm is what makes you the money, but there are contest, dog/horse races, holidays events, people to talk to.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't have much to add on this point. There is a giant ocean everywhere, maybe put in some fishing in there. To push the fishing further have it so you have to spend money on bait so I can relieve myself of all this currency. There are some NPCs that mail you in the game, but they are basicaly just tutorials. It would be nice if you could have a convorsation with them, even if it was every two days you get a message you can reply with a set of three replies and two days later they reply to you. To make this more complex we can link these people with that Request device. After a while of doing requests or forming a relationship with the NPCs you can specifically request items that you want/need and trade the items that they want for the items that you want.\n\nInventory Management. This one isn't really a big deal but I still had a problem with it. The way inventory management works in this game is you have four invintory slots, each slot can hold one type of item and can hold up to a max of twenty of that item. I didn't have a problem with that, but what I did have a problem with was when you are going to sell the slime items for money. You have to shoot each slime item out of your inventory one-by-one at the designated area to sell it. It takes about one second to shoot ten of the twenty. So, if you have all four inventory slots full, takes two seconds per slot, that will equal about eight seconds to empty your inventory. Not bad, not much to complain about there. But when you can upgrade the max quantity to forty, thats about four seconds per slot. That comes to sixteen seconds total per trip. That can waste a good amount of time.\n\nI think the best way to solve this is to have an upgrade that I buy for the Market and have it so all Items in my inventory are automatically sold. Or a menu to pop up instead with the amount of items I want to sell. This not only goes for the market but also for the storage Silos. Depositing and Withdrawing both suffer from this problem. You have to take them out and put them in one-by-one.\n\nThe Little things. The Pulse Wave, and upgrade that can emit a pulse that pushes slimes away. While it's true that they do go away, but two feet away is still IN my way. A little more force would be nice. The isn't really anything to do at night time, there is a slime that you can get but because I already had others that provided more money I didn't bother. When using the vaccum gun to suck up items the items would sometimes fly in a spiral pattern around the barrel or get stuck on the edge of the barrel.\nWow, would you look at that wall of text. It kind of sounds like I'm bashing the game. No, I'm saying all this because I want this to succeed, for these things to be thought about. Let's move on to the stuff I liked.\n\nIt looks cute and good, very colorful. It was awesome getting the jetpack and flying around a little and when you were flying around you found a hidden area with some food that you had never seen before, and then you found even more hidden areas above you and on the other side of the canyon walls. The game itself ran very well, I didn't experiance any lag or crashes of anykind. The types of slimes are creative and fun. The music really caught me attention, It reminded me of one of my favorite games Dark Cloud 2 and you are in the town of Palm Brinks.","February 7","false","3.6"," 85 of 155 people (55%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","55","85","155","5","7"

One is when one of my pet Pink Tabby largos that escaped turned into a Tarr while i was collecting some food for them on the other side of the ranch which resulted in something that resembled World War Z as it ate and spread to the other corrals. I turned back to see hundreds of poor innocent slimes and dozens of chickens being eaten from at least over 50 Tarr, all because of 1 happy largo wanting some more food. The other was a glitch when 4 Rock Tabby Largos were trying to eat the same carrot, which resulted in them starting to rotate faster and faster until they eventually obliterated the airnet and catapulted themselves off into space.\n\nThis is the sort of game that can be recommended to almost anyone, and I cannot recommend it enough.","May 26","true","13.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","88","7","8","9","0"

(Im not entire sure as I haven't tried a lot of combinations), upgrades to health, energy, storage, a pulse wave, and a jetpack. There are boxes spread around the island that contain the basic items you can find, but also have some quick gold inside. There is the wonder of seeing your first golden slime and wondering if youre supposed to pick it up or feed it really quick. And upgrades for the ranch? Dont even get me started. Around 25 possible areas to house slimes, chickens, fruit farms, vegetable gardens, an incinerator, a silo for storage, and a pond for storing puddle slimes. You can house your basic slimes there seperate so you can collect them all, or combine them to reap a better harvest! But hopefully you have the food and money to keep up with them!

The game feels very polished even in its current early access state. There is certainly a mix of farming and adventure game in here.\n\nEssentially, you are a slime farmer who is grinding to best manage a slime farm into something very profitable. You risk adventure to help expand your farm. There are many different tactics and choices to make that could be successful, which adds lots of replay value (I haven't reached a final point with any of my farms yet, which is probably after ~15 hours so far). There is a nice little economy system, as well as a really awesome 'breeding' system (I use that term litely here, since its not quite that - but close!).\n\nPros:\n+Very polished.\n+Great mix of farming and adventure.\n+There is nothing very difficult in the game so far. It is quite relaxing and is definately casual.\n+Quite addicting to learn how the whole system works, and to keep grinding to make your farm better and better.\n+Lots of awesome upgrades for yourself (ie. rocket pack, health-ups, and many more), and your farm (ie. more pens, better safety and capacity, among many many others).\n+The economy system can really offer a bit of strategy at the moment with prices that fluctuate with in-game days, as well as trading, etc.\n+Music and graphics are very well done. Very fitting, too.\n\nCons:\n-I'm hungry for wayyy more slime varieties and wayyy more upgrades! Game has sooo much room for expansion!\n\nI know its fairly pricey, but I really think its worth it - especially if you like really addicting casual farming games.","January 14","true","4.1"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","12","18","2","0"

Even at this early stage the game mechanics are solid though at times hilariously chaotic.  It's charmingly adorable if not a bit indulgantly saccharine.  Everything is round and bouncy and colorful, and there's a satisfaction to be had in vaccuming up and penning in small round creatures.\n\n\nHOWEVER, this game is probably not worth $20 as it is right now.  While it's very easy to figure out and the path you take to make progress is rather concice, the game currently lacks any solid or even vague end-goal.  So far it's ranch slimes to make money so you can buy upgrades.  At a certain point you run out of upgrades to buy and a bunch of the game areas are yet to be implamented (as indicated by a cute little sign of a slime in a hard hat).\n\nMy advice?  Get this game, but wait for version like 0.7 or the full release, as right now you can get through pretty much all the games content in about 4-5 hours.\n\nThat being said I don't really regret the early access purchase, and I'm excitedly looking forward to more content.","February 2","true","6.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GreenTomator/recommended/433340/","GreenTomator","GreenTomato","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GreenTomator/","1598 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis will be a basic review as I've not played the game enough to know everything yet.\n\nThe game is adorable, the visuals are great, I love all the little slime animations and interactions.\nThe background music and the sound effects fit the game perfectly. Some of the noises the slimes make remind me of lemmings (yep, I'm old enough to talk about lemmings >.>).\nThe game play is fairly simple; you're a rancher in first person view with a vacuum/launcher that catches slimes in the wild, you build holding pens for then and little gardens or coops for their food and you take care of the little critters. Your income comes from collecting their crystallized poop and selling it to a vending machine. There is a miniquest vending machine as well.\nThere are a few areas still locked for me, as I only played the game for a little while, so I'm not familiar with everything yet.\n\nThe engine of the game runs very smoothly on my machine even though it's not exactly brand new, I love that the game does not require DX11 as my card can't handle that, there's a lot of things I can control in the options menu including the shadows and textures, so I'm sure if anyone has some issues with the game running smoothly they can tweak those, I have even streamed the game and had no issues with that.\n\nObviousely I haven't seen everything in the game yet, but I still get the impression that there isn't a lot of content in it, I hope more things get added soon, I would like to have some steam achievements as well, and maybe have some more customization available for my farm, including the house and things beside the corrals and holding pens. This game would benefit greatly from some kind of coop mode, that would greatly enhance the gameplay on it's own.\n\nPros:\n- Looks great\n- Sounds great\n- Runs smoothly\n- Adorable little game\n\nCons:\n- Needs more steam content\n- Early Access (don't know what to expect in the future, some EA games changed drastically before release, some didn't do enough)\n- No Multiplayer (I really hope this changes)\n\nI highly recommend this game","February 14","true","6.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","5","6","2","0"

The graphics are great and it is rare that your ranch messes up while you are out exploring. There are still a few glitches and the game's current state is rather short (about 10 hours long if you know what you're doing). Like most 3d games, if you are running this game on a potato it can occasionally lag, but this can be solved by reducing the graphics. Slime Rancher really is a better experience with some knowledge going into the game and it is recommended that beginners read the flavor text and "Slimepedia" entries under each object.","March 16","true","36.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","5","6","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxfire28/recommended/433340/","Foxfire28","Epsilon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxfire28/","89 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSlimer Rancher is a interesting game where you find and capture creatures called slimes to crossbreed them with other slimes to eventually harvest resources called Plorts. These plorts can be sold for money which can then be used to upgrade and therefore improve the way you capture and house these creatures to better harvest them for their plorts.\n\nI spend hours going from a single and very basic corral for my slimes to multiple different high level corrals to house my ever growing collection of different slimes. The mechanic where you breed different slimes to combine traits of either slime is a very nice mechanic and allows players to strategize a little. For instance, I decided to only breed my slimes with a certain slime called a Rock Slime. The nice trait that rock slimes have to offer is their diet. They eat vegetables and therefore when bred with other slimes, their diet will also be veggies. Breeding all my various types of slimes with rock slimes allowed me to only grow veggies rather than a mixture of different things.\n\nThe game itself felt responsive and actually well polished. Never lagged or stuttered a bit. Never encountered a single issue or bug in the 14 hours I had played. Feels like a AAA title. The art style is great as well. Everything fits together perfectly and the design of the textures and models are top notch.\n\nAs for the breeding, the game allows you to only breed two base slimes together to create a final "Largo" slime which cannot be breed any longer. There might be a dozen or so different types of slimes, so for their to only be a single breeding per slime was unfortunate. It would be nice to see a in dept breeding tree of some sort. Breeding 3 or 4 different slimes together to finally reach a desired slime. A old mobile app called Dragon Story did it pretty well. You were given different base dragons and were given the option to breed them together. Each pair of dragons you bred together had a list of possible offspring it could create ranging in rarity, the more rare dragons having a lower percentage of actually getting. Those dragons could then be bred again with other dragons to further continue down the "ladder" to get more rare dragons.\n\nI love the upgrade aspect to the different equipment you can purchase. Upgrading your corral to have, for example, an auto-feeder or auto-collector was a nice feature to have in a game like this. Almost every type equipment, whether it be a chicken coop, garden, or silo, each gave me options to upgrade and improve to make my life easier.\n\nHowever, this game does seem to get quite repetitive after you've captured and breed most of the slimes and upgraded the different buildings. It went from adventuring to find more and cooler slimes to babysitting my slimes at my ranch. It got to the point, every quickly I may add, where I had pretty much every base type of slime in my ranch. At that point all you can do is continue to feed them and harvest the plorts for money, but already had purchased everything I could buy to improve my farm. I had 4 corrals, all upgraded to the max, 5 gardens growing veggies, a pond, and a silo. Now those aren't the only things you can buy but that is all I needed to keep my farm self sufficient.\n\nPros\nEntertaining game. Kept me interesting for hours and had me missing it when I couldn't be playing it.\nOverall idea of breeding and selling resources for money works and is actually pretty fun.\nFeels like a polished AAA title\nGreat art-style\nNeutral\nThe upgrading mechanic for buildings and tools is nice, but I wish it could be developed further with more long-term upgrades. I found myself having everything unlocked and with ton of cash to buy nothing with.\nHarvesting crops to feed my slimes became a huge chore and took up a huge amount of my ingame day to make sure my 4+ corrals were properly feed. Would be nice if there was some sort of high tier upgrade that allowed more automation to solve this issues, possibly with food/resource transport pipes or something connecting gardens to silos, and silos to corrals for automatic feeding. This of course would be late-game stuff. (See suggestions below)\nThe environment itself was very nice to the eyes, but felt too linear and closed off. Rather than it feeling like a vast and open world, it felt like hallways and corridors with a nature facade.\nCons\nGets boring after a while (at least for me). Quickly had all the upgrades and was in a loop of gathering plorts and selling them. Had over 15,000 currency with nothing to do with it.\nBreeding feels a bit lacking in my opinion. Could be more in-depth with different levels other than the single level breeding the game features now.\n$20 USD does not seem like an appropriate price tag for this game. $14.99 could possibly be a better price.\nOverall it is a good game. I would recommend this game to a friend.\n\nMy Suggestions:\nAs for things I would like to see added to the game, my biggest suggestion would be to allow players to almost nearly automise their ranch. It would be nice to see a game mechanic that allowed players to automatically transport finished crops into a silo via transport tubes or something and then distributed via different tubes to nearby corrals. Possibly having plorts be extracted for corrals and sent to silos via transport tubes as well. I love the upgrade mechanic but I wish I could see it be more used and more in depth than its current state.","June 3","true","18.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It has a lovely art direction, simple gameplay and it just makes me smile so much.\n\nBut the negative comments do bring up a good point. As of right now, not much content is in the game yet. I'm sure a lot more is coming but for the moment, it is missing more meat to it. I understand why people love it though. It's one of those games you can play for hours while listening to something else in the background.\n\nI'm not entirely sure in what direction the devs are going to take it, but it'd be nice of them to pull other things from similar games in the genre. Add little ideas here and there. Slime guards for your ranch or pet slimes that help you carry things back to your ranch.\n\nIf you really must have a cute management game with colorful slimes, by all means buy it. I can see a lot of potential here to make something wonderful, but as of right now, wait a bit longer before buying it. At least until the next update to see what they add.\n","January 17","false","7.6"," 393 of 761 people (52%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","52","393","761","18","44"

I really didn't. Okay, I've seen people play this game on YouTube, and I thought "What the heck, I'll try it." Seems I made the right choice, although I really do hope that there is more to expand upon in later updates.\n\nFor right now, what you get for your money is a game that lets you build some corrals within which you get to keep a bunch of little slimes that give you "plorts" that you can exchange for money. Which lets you build more corrals. Which gets you more plorts and... okay, you get the idea.\n\nThe graphics as a whole are really simplistic with the whole cellshaded look that seems to be a standard with Steam-based Early Access Games. Not that I'm complaining about this fact; the graphics as a whole are simple but beautiful, setting the mood entirely within the first second that you boot up the game and load into your burgeoning Slime Ranch.\n\nThe music is along the same lines as the graphics: simple guitar music, a little bit of a wind section, and then you add in the atmosphere provided by the silly little noises that the slimes make, and you get a really enjoyable and relaxing experience. Sure there's these evil slimes called the Tarr that make the music get all dangerous-sounding, but that's about as dark and gloomy as you will ever get when playing this game. Maybe they will add more enemies in later updates, I'm not sure.\n\nThere is some complexity to the game, though I have a feeling that the developers stressed the importance of simplicity and ease of play - making it easy for both "casual" and "hardcore" gamer crowds to pick it up and start playing like a pro as soon as they get through about ten minutes of play. You vacuum up slimes, store them in corrals, and feed them their favorite food. You can upgrade the corrals to let you hold more and keep them all safe and secure, and you can also have corrals in different areas in order to allow for different species of slimes to live contently, but that's as deep as things get.\n\nHowever, this causes a lack of depth for players that can and will sit and play it for hours. I've almost put in five hours and I've already filled up every single corral with money-making slimes. Sure the exploration is nice, but as of right now there seems to be a very linear path that the developers have set up for us, with little sections cordoned off. Possibly for later updates?","February 21","true","7.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

It's a nice change from the games I usually play. Active games such as Rocket League which take so much energy to play that you have to take a break after an hour. Slime Rancher is a nice, relaxing yet challenging game. I don't know what I could say that others haven't already mentioned. Since it's an early access game, the amount of content is little. Although, even with the little amount of content it is already a fun game to play.\n\nThe only option I would really love to see is a local co-op or internet co-op. I'd love to be able to have a ranch with friends.

Ever.\n\n\nThe slimes are adorable, and there are more where those came from, the game devs aren't even done making the new ones.\n\nSo many things you can do and make, like farming slimes, food, sotring that food, getting blown up by a boom slime, falling down a hole without being able to get up because you didn't buy the jetpack yet, trading, discovering new slimes, farming those slimes, getting rich, buying more things for your slimes to get more money to buy more of that (rinse and repeat), and finally, blow up massive largo slimes by feeding them a ton and getting that key to unlock a new part of the massive world.

Something so diametrically opposed to your very foundation that it makes you doubt that the ideals of goodness and righteousness not only have ever existed, but possibly can never exist.\nIf there was 387.44 million miles of printed circuits in wafer thin layers that filled your complex and if the word "hate" was engraved on each nanoangstrom of those hundreds of miles, it would not equal one one-billionth of the hate you feel for this thing at this micro-instant.\n\nSlime Rancher is the exact opposite of that.\nIt is literally the anti-Hitler.","February 13","true","13.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I'm kind of at a stand still at the moment because of limited content, but I can't wait for updates to continue to come out.\n\nThe only thing I would maybe like to see is an upgrade to the gardens? If we could be able to grow more than one thing per garden (Even if it's the same item already planted). Even with the upgrades to speed up growth and number of items produced, it still isn't quite enough to keep up with the slimes. Unless the updates are planning to open more areas for corrals, coops, etc. I also agree with a post someone posted about having an area off of our ranch that has a fresh water area to keep puddle slimes instead of the pond.\n\nI still rate 10/10, though!

The only thing you can really do past that is continue to explore and gather slimes, and buy a few neat upgrades for your vac and farm, but even despite the lack of things to do it can still be incredibly fun to just open the game, feed your slimes, and explore a bit.\n\nPeople aren't lying when they say this game is a feel-good game either, I've been on depression meds for 14 years and this game is more effective in minutes than any of my meds have been in years.\n\nWhat can I say though, I have a huge weak spot for cute ♥♥♥♥, and these slimes are really ♥♥♥♥ing adorable.  If I die, it's probably because my heart couldn't handle the tabby slimes.","February 18","true","25.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","1"

I played it before it was available on Steam and so far have enjoyed countless hours of mindlessly farming the cutest slimes I've ever seen. You can not only herd, collect, and combine different slimes, but you can turn them into horrible abominations that will try and eat you if you aren't careful.\n\nFor being early access, it's very well developed. The graphics are nice and cartoony that lends to a relaxed, and fun feeling. You could easily play this game for hours and barely notice. Don't get me wrong though, there is still a lot of work to be done and currently it doesn't have a story which may turn some people off. The devs have mapped out their road map to show you what is up and coming on their website. There will be new slimes, new areas, a story, and more to upgrade at the ranch.\n\nIt was easily worth the buy for me, but as for any early access you may need to weight the pros and cons as well as take a look at exactly what they've laid out for future releases.\n\nHappy ranching!!","January 15","true","1.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","3","4","2","0"

Yes the game doesn't have much content but you see there's a reason why this game is an "Early Access Game". "Early Access Game" means there is not going to be much content because the game is nto done yet. So the fact that you're negatively reviewing an unfinished game for lack of content either means a) your a ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥. or b) your a ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥ and you don't even know what an "Early Access Game" is you ♥♥♥♥ing plebs. That being said this game is awesome. Buy it. Collect cute little slimes. And be the best god damn rancher you can be. ♥♥♥♥ you you god damn negative reviewing plebs.\n\nTake this next section with a grain of salt, im just raging at a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ for being ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nBecause of the user     DonTheDon    I felt the need to expand upon my review. DonTheDon is the perfect example of the types of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ im telling you not to listen to. He clearly did not read my comment because he said and i quote "You should seriously stop caring about what other people think, You might live longer". If he even read my comment and had above a third grade education he would understand thats exactly what im telling people to do, not give a ♥♥♥♥ about the negative reviews. But this kid is clearly too ♥♥♥♥ing dense to even read at a third grade level. On top of that he's a hypocrite. He's telling me not to care about someones opinion meanwhile he clearly cares about mine. So DonTheDon hop back on your short bus and go back to special ed because you're ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and thanks for proving a point.","February 16","true","6.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","63","5","8","4","3"

Turns out slimes can jump over the edge. No problem. Raised the walls. Slimes are still climbing over. Damn. I put a net on top!

I didn't think it'd be as fun as it was when I first got it, but I am glad I did.\n\nWhat I think could help benefit it:\n1.) I think there needs to be more conflict/punishment with things that happen in game. It'd be interesting for the dynamic of the game if there were by chance more ways to lose money, like a random chance/event role or random misfortunes here and there. Otherwise it is REALLY easy to stock up on money and all the slimes necessary in the game.\n\n2.) It'd be interesting to incorporate special hybrid plorts. So say you have 2 different types of slimes made into a hybrid in the game (like the deadly Rock Boom Largos that I made on accident), and they had their own "Rock Boom Plort" which would be worth more/less depending on demand.\n\n3.) Lastly, the world definitely needs expansion and more places to explore. It wouldn't hurt to add more "easter egg" like things here and there, or even maybe slime lore. :) The Slimes have keys, yes? It'd be interesting to hear how they managed to make it and maybe see like ancient slime stories here and there or something like it.","February 9","true","14.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But if you mix too many you can get tars and they will wreck your ranch fast.\n\n+Game has a good art style, can't wait to see more areas unlocked and playable.\n\n+More slimes are coming!\n\nCons every game has em\n-The trading system seems to be pointless at best, a waste of over all time and effort for next to no rewards.\n\n-Lack of music, game has a few songs but nothing to fantastic or immersive, would like to see more music in the game.\n\nI really did try to think of more cons but that's it, besides this game being in Alpha I won't be including any of the bugs\n\nSome sort of rivalry to add some sort of goal/competition to the game even if its just AI.\n\nSome improvement to some of the basic functions, such as when you plant something in a garden after a few harvests the plant will die, I would like an auto planter to replant or maybe a counter letting me know I should hold one of these fruits/veggies so I can replant.  (ooks like in the newist version they did something about this sorta)\n\nA better trade system...trading 43 pink slimes 30 rock slimes and 20 tabbys for 10 carrots is not a good deal.\n\nA competition or such that say the over all ranching federation hosts and has categories and rewards based on them.\n\nSelling plorts straight is alright, but I would like to see a system where you can turn those plorts in to something else and then sell the product for even more credits.\n\nHelpers/robot hands something to help mange the sheer numbers that you will be getting in to as you can capture sooo soo many slimes.\n\nIt's cool you can make your ranch how you want, but I would like to change the visuals of my over all ranch, maybe paint the area or lay out some carpet or change how my little hut looks and such.\n\nThis is just a few things.\nTL;DR Game is good, has its ups and down like every game but this game is worth it,  and the devs seem to be really involved in their project so I recommend giving them your support.\n\nFor everyone who did read though it, Thank you for reading :D I hope some one will find this helpfull.\n\nA message to the devs, this is a fantastic game keep it up and you get all my support on steam for this game, if you need people to be more involved or would over all like to reach out for any reason, I would be more then happy to help.","January 17","true","1.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can gather slimes and resources with your Vac-Pack (Think, a gun that's also a 4 container vacuum cleaner) and then bring them to your ranch to tend to them, all to strike it rich with a resource only slimes produce: plorts.\n\nFirst off, allow me to note that I wouldn't normally review an Early Access game unless it left a solid impression, and man did this game leave a strong impression.\n\nNow, the game's simple mechanic that is made obvious right away is how you tend to slimes, and it works really well. You bring slimes to ranch, you feed them, you collect their plorts, you sell their plorts, all the while making sure all your other resources are doing well or if you have to go out and about to get more. It's a nice relaxing feel, that I haven't exactly felt in a game in a long time. Just going around and tending to the slimes, then exploring to bring more home with me just is a nice way to relax.\n\nThe relaxing part is aided by the beautiful soundtrack. Each area has its own music, and every song is simply suiting and relaxing, and it makes the world just a bit more lively.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful as well. Everything is colorful without being eye-searing. The pallettes all work well together, and it leaves a beautiful image that is fun to simply traverse and admire. Not to mention the slimes are made to be extremely cute, if you couldn't tell by the trailer already. Overall the visuals give the game a nice sense of charm and gives the game it's own unique style.\n\nGameplay is also pretty interesting, and does something I wish more games these days would do: Not hold your hand. Sure, it teaches you the basic controls, but that is literally it. It's up to you to figure out what is and isn't possible, either by observing the world around you, or going through the "Slimepedia" (Basically a booklet explaining what things you've found do). It leads to a nice sense of discovery, learning what does and doesn't work, and what you want your dream slime ranch to be, as well as dangers of what happen if you screw up.\n\nOne final note that I applaud the developers for: Interacting with the community. I've been to their forums, and they not only actively show progress but work with fans to come up with new and brilliant ideas. Few devs seem to do this these days and it's nice seeing game developers not trying to hide behind closed doors.\n\n\nThat all said, there are a few issues, namely that money becomes a bit too easy to get for no real reason. Granted, this is Early Access and from what I've read they seem to plan something about this but as it stands once you get a ranch going you never can really run out of money unless you try. I've seen people reach 100k in about 10 in game days, so it's not terribly tough.\n\nThere also isn't much in terms of exploration for now, though they clearly have a lot planned in that regard as well.\n\nFinally one big issue I have is the slow speed it takes to grab and sell plorts from machines. Put it nicely, if you hold about 50 of a kind of plort, it takes about 30 seconds (real time) to empty them into the market. Thing is, it's not tough to get about 200 per run, assuming it's ONLY a single run you are doing, and it just kills the pacing of the game, as I sit at my desk holding my mouse button down waiting for it to be done just so I can go do something else (if you don't sell them, they can easily start to overflow).\n\n\nOverall, a brilliant early access game that is fun and relaxing. Great atmosphere, and looks amazing. Definitely suggest getting it if you're into relaxing games.","February 14","true","9.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Again it is still early access, early early access if I'm to be honest.\nI spent 5 hours my first day blowing through what content there was other than in-game achievments. After that there wasn't much else as I already bought all the equipment upgrades and land expansions. That doesn't mean there still isn't anything to do though as you can explore the unfinished areas, perfect your ranch setup, hoard chickens and goof around causing destruction via shooting poo out of your vacpack.\n\nI feel my $20 was a bit of a costly investment for a game this simple, however if it keeps to path the developers have planned it'll definiatley be worth it in the end!\n\nFor all those who are on the fence: I'd say wait a bit for the next few updates or even complition unless you really want to see this game finished!","February 3","true","15.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Build gardens and coops to keep your feed up to date and micro-manage food intake and money retreival.\n\nIt sounds simple an it is, there's no real large challenge here. All your goals can be achieved at a pace you set for yourself. There's minor problems you need to avoid like hostile Slimes and the ones that turn into freaks of nature but in the end, it's just really chill. And I for one am glad to have played it. It's just what I needed.","January 19","true","6.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Illius19616/recommended/433340/","Illius19616","Illius","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Illius19616/","88 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSlime Rancher is a farm-type game where you tend to slimes and explore the planet in search of new slimes. You can gather slimes and resources with your Vac-Pack (Think, a gun that's also a 4 container vacuum cleaner) and then bring them to your ranch to tend to them, all to strike it rich with a resource only slimes produce: plorts.\n\nFirst off, allow me to note that I wouldn't normally review an Early Access game unless it left a solid impression, and man did this game leave a strong impression.\n\nNow, the game's simple mechanic that is made obvious right away is how you tend to slimes, and it works really well. You bring slimes to ranch, you feed them, you collect their plorts, you sell their plorts, all the while making sure all your other resources are doing well or if you have to go out and about to get more. It's a nice relaxing feel, that I haven't exactly felt in a game in a long time. Just going around and tending to the slimes, then exploring to bring more home with me just is a nice way to relax.\n\nThe relaxing part is aided by the beautiful soundtrack. Each area has its own music, and every song is simply suiting and relaxing, and it makes the world just a bit more lively.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful as well. Everything is colorful without being eye-searing. The pallettes all work well together, and it leaves a beautiful image that is fun to simply traverse and admire. Not to mention the slimes are made to be extremely cute, if you couldn't tell by the trailer already. Overall the visuals give the game a nice sense of charm and gives the game it's own unique style.\n\nGameplay is also pretty interesting, and does something I wish more games these days would do: Not hold your hand. Sure, it teaches you the basic controls, but that is literally it. It's up to you to figure out what is and isn't possible, either by observing the world around you, or going through the "Slimepedia" (Basically a booklet explaining what things you've found do). It leads to a nice sense of discovery, learning what does and doesn't work, and what you want your dream slime ranch to be, as well as dangers of what happen if you screw up.\n\nOne final note that I applaud the developers for: Interacting with the community. I've been to their forums, and they not only actively show progress but work with fans to come up with new and brilliant ideas. Few devs seem to do this these days and it's nice seeing game developers not trying to hide behind closed doors.\n\n\nThat all said, there are a few issues, namely that money becomes a bit too easy to get for no real reason. Granted, this is Early Access and from what I've read they seem to plan something about this but as it stands once you get a ranch going you never can really run out of money unless you try. I've seen people reach 100k in about 10 in game days, so it's not terribly tough.\n\nThere also isn't much in terms of exploration for now, though they clearly have a lot planned in that regard as well.\n\nFinally one big issue I have is the slow speed it takes to grab and sell plorts from machines. Put it nicely, if you hold about 50 of a kind of plort, it takes about 30 seconds (real time) to empty them into the market. Thing is, it's not tough to get about 200 per run, assuming it's ONLY a single run you are doing, and it just kills the pacing of the game, as I sit at my desk holding my mouse button down waiting for it to be done just so I can go do something else (if you don't sell them, they can easily start to overflow).\n\n\nOverall, a brilliant early access game that is fun and relaxing. Great atmosphere, and looks amazing. Definitely suggest getting it if you're into relaxing games.","February 14","true","9.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

After that there wasn't much else as I already bought all the equipment upgrades and land expansions.

There is a blend of farm management and exploration/discovery that works wonderfully together. I love that I can work on my ranch, strategically combining and corralling slimes for as long as I like, and then go wander off into the world without feeling pressured or obligated to return until I want to. Slime Rancher is a farming game where the player genuinely enjoys working on their ranch and feels rewarded for doing so, without having the activities feel like chores or obligations.\n\nThe slimes, of course, are wonderful! Not only are they ridiculously cute and make adorable little squeaky noises, but there is also strategy involved in raising them. The player can choose to keep them in corrals or free-range their slimes, both options of which have their own challenges and rewards. Slimes can also be combined with the power of science, and hybrid slimes add an additional level of strategy and thought to the game. More dangerous slimes, for example, may be more profitable but potentially harder to take care of or keep under control. You may also want to combine a slime that prefers a harder-to-come-by food source with one whose favorite meal is more readily available, creating a hybrid that is easier to feed.\n\nI first played Slime Rancher in the Pre-Alpha stage, and even then was utterly captivated by the game, playing it for hours. This is an Early Access title of course, so many of the features and much of the content has yet to be implemented. However, I was surprised by the amount of depth already apparent in this game and I am now eagerly awaiting future updates! Great job guys!","January 18","true","5.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The sum of the content presently (0.2.4b) takes about 3-4 hours to get through, and it's a lot of fun.\n\nCapture a bunch of weirdly happy slimes and stick them in sci-fi cages. Feed them and gather poop for fun and profit! Breed them and make a lot of really weird and questionable mixed-types! Breed too many and create an abomination that will ruin your livelihood!\n\nOr just run around exploring the cute world with the fun terrain and a complete lack of invisible walls.","January 23","true","3.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Start a ranch and gather slimes and put them in Corrals. Customise these small cages to fit the sub-species of Slime and feed them their favourite foods. Build gardens and coops to keep your feed up to date and micro-manage food intake and money retreival.\n\nIt sounds simple an it is, there's no real large challenge here. All your goals can be achieved at a pace you set for yourself. There's minor problems you need to avoid like hostile Slimes and the ones that turn into freaks of nature but in the end, it's just really chill. And I for one am glad to have played it.

Lol. Anyways, when I first played the game, there was allot to it even though it had early, non finished textures.When I kept playing on, the game grew, more land, more slimes, plus more food textures. Man that was a big spoiler. It is a first person gameplay and NOW have awesome graphics and textures. I highly recommend this silly, but awesome game. If more of you guys join in this game, maybe the creators can add new supplements and other stuff to the game. Also maybe a chance for a multiplayer slime toss game! WHO KNOWS what they can add.

I've already spent 6 hours playing and I plan to spend more, though I've already done most of what is available. It's very soothing and nice to be able to perfect the production of your ranch!\n\nI'm not sure how far this game has to go before being finished, but I want to throw in a few suggestions I think may help!\n\n• More slime types! I know you plan to add more anyway, but maybe slimes that will interact with each other in certain ways? The best I can think off the top of my head if a Mouse slime, because of the Tabby slime... *cough* anyway;\n(an obligitory "Ice slime" comes to mind as well)\n\n• I'm the type of person that doesn;t mind a more linear game, though whenever I find secret off-shoots along the path I get very excited! I like getting rewarded for my exploring, so maybe more secret areas?\n\n• Perhaps different fauna or flora in the environment? I understand that the premise of the game is that you're on an alien planet with slimes, so maybe more alien environments to explore?\n\n• I like the idea of having water-based slimes in the game, so maybe more slimes of their type and more ways to care for them on your ranch? The "Pond" is incredibly bare-bones at the moment and I'd like to see it expanded.\n\nAll in all, a great start! I look forward to seeing this game complete so I can lose more hours to it on my days off. At the moment I'd reccommend buying it if you watched the trailer and thought "This looks like my type of game", cause it most likely is!\nIf not.. well, wait till it gets finished I guess.\n","February 12","true","9.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In the space of a few hours, I had done everything there is to do in the game. I was going to wait for a bit more to come out with the game, but I couldn't resist.\n\nThat... is really my only negative thing I have to say about the game. For now, I'm blaming it on Early Access. Updates seem to have come out fairly regularly, so I have high hopes that progress will continue to give players more things to do and explore. I'm looking forward to updates that give larger and more dangerous areas. While I can't imagine this game going into the "Hardcore" area of gaming difficulty, it would be nice to have even the smallest bit of danger from the things that the game warns you to be careful with.\n\nThe slimes are adorable. The farming is somehow less than boring. Exploration is fairly simple. The colors are bright. The music is nice. I sadly cannot say that there is anything spectacular about the game, as I didn't feel really challenged, intrigued, or drawn into it by anything in particular. It's just an overall nice and friendly game for casual gamers to enjoy.\n\nIf you're worried you won't get your money's worth out of game time, then wait for future updates. Currently, I have not gotten my money's worth, after doing everything the game has to offer. Despite that, I still recommend the game to anyone who enjoys exploration and farming. There's no lie in the title or game design, it's exactly what the game is. You ranch slimes for money, so you can afford to ranch more slimes and test out various slime combinations.","February 25","true","13.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The range of slimes so far are pretty cool, especially the Tabby Slimes as they are cat slimes. All of the Slimes are frickin' adorable, and can traits from another. My favourite Largo Slime is the one that’s a mix of the boom and rock slime, as it looks like the Bomb monsters out of Final Fantasy games, and it looks so frickin' cute. I am really interested to see what Slimes they may add in the future, like Woolly Slimes, or Mossy Slimes, or even Draco Slimes. It would be cool to see more slimes that are kinda environment dependent like the Puddle Slimes; it would be cool to see Icy Slimes that need a cold climate in their cage thing or even in an icy cavern or something or Slimes that can only live underwater, or Ecto Slimes that can go through normal walls of the cage thing and require special walls to contain them, stuff like that. Or other mechanics such as Slime behaviour between one another, like one acts aggressively to another, plus different environments. The amount of different slimes you could have is immense.\n\nIt would also be cool I think to add different types of Tarr Slimes and possibly implement a tower defence like mechanism, where you have to add defences to keep them eating your slimes and what not. Or that certain upgrade can be available after certain events, and these can help you get different slimes that couldn’t be captured before, or even just upgrades that allow access to new environments, such as mentioned previously underwater, this way it changes it from having to get slime keys or paying to open new parts.\n\nThe only problem that annoys me is how much the auto feeder dispenses food, it just seems like a waste and then having to go pick all of the uneaten food up is just a hassle. Or then again I might not have enough Slimes in my cage things lol. But it would be nice if the feeder knew how many slimes there were and adjusted the amount of food it spits out accordingly.\n\nSo yeah I went on a bit haha, this game is definitely worth a play, especially if you’re having a stressful day or just if you want to past the time, and I'm really excited to see what they'll add to it in the future 8.5/10 ^-^","January 30","true","13.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Being in early acces and having my type of PC gives me a tiny bit of lag here and there but nothing to big or really noticable (or atleast that often).\n\nThe game is about the player being a Slime Rancher in an unknown World. Overall you could say that it is a mix between Harvest Moon and Rune Factory - being able to activly fight the Monsters of the world. And yes, there are Monsters besides the normal Slimes which are... SLIMES! In all seriousness: The Monsters basically are a corrupted version of the normal slimes that have combined with another slimetype. If they now eat something they shouldnt and would basically transform again because of it they corrupt and turn into an evil entity that tries to kill everything that is around, meaning that it even attacks the adorable Slimes that it was created of.\n\nEven though there isnt much to the game it has a big area to explore, farm upgrades and upgradable areas and a wide variety of Slimes. And is up to you to capture and combine them. If you do this, Watch out. Like mentioned above the Slimes, if they eat something they shouldnt, will corrupt. And this has nothing to do with what they like to eat or what not. Because what they dont like/dont want to eat, they wont eat. But there are things they dont know as food and they might get curious as to what it tastes like. And then it is up to you to save your little slimes.\n\nIt is an early access game and I know how many people dislike this sort of stuff. But maybe it helps when I say that I bought this hours before it was released on Steam just so I could finally play it.\n\nIf you really want the game: Buy it. If the overall game looks nice but you dont know if it would be a game for you: Dont buy it. I say this is a take it or leave it kind of game because you will have to invest alot of time and thought into what you are doing on your farm.","January 14","true","8.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Where to even start with this game?! Let me just start by saying I tend to play only games where I can be competitive with other players in a multi-player setting. A single player game that I play "alone" has to be REALLY good to grab my attention, let alone keep it. I am not easily impressed, I'm cynical at times, and I think I am a hard judge. Slime Rancher is one of those rare games for me that just won right away. I've been playing for a while before it came out on steam - when I first downloaded it in Alpha and booted it up, and I think I played about 6 hours straight without a break, and then finally snapped out of it and realized how long I had been sitting there captivated, and that I had made more in-game currency than my character could spend on any more upgrades, gadgets, or buildings.\n\nYou know what really defines this game? It's just fun. Everything about it is fun, and enjoyable to be a part of. The graphics are fun, the sounds are fun, the music is fun, the way the controls work and how you interact with the world is fun. A game has to be fun to grab you and not let you go for hours and hours on end. I wouldn't say it will appeal to everyone, but if you're like 'Ooo, that looks like something I would probably like", then I think its fair to say you will really dig it. If you like simulation games, farming games, collecting games, adventure games, or any mix of those - this is a game you can't pass up.\n\nI am SO excited for the future of this game - it has so much potential, it could grow and grow until it was a Massively Multiplayer Online game if it wanted to. It could be like World of Warcraft, but it would be World of Slime Rancher. I hope the Slime Rancher "world" will expand hugely if it gets the support it deserves on here. I think the Devs are really professional and have a lot of talent - this game takes concepts that you may have enjoyed before in other games, and shines them up to a perfect mix that has to be played to be understood. The sheer enjoyment you get out of simpley running around and vaccuuming up all the various resources and living things the land has to offer is mind-boggling enough - it's like an easter egg hunt on drugs. This game is drugs.\n\nPLEASE Monomi Park, expand this drug of a game so I can stop reloading your website and twitter feed 5 times a day! We wait with baited breath, and hang on every word. We're not completely sure why, but we want MORE =)","January 14","true","0.1"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

I know the game is in early access but I'd suggest not showing off stuff which isn't in the game. Such as the green slimes (rad slimes) in one of the teasers and putting green plorts on the list. Also, the unattainable achievements such as "visit the quarry", "visit the glass desert", "stand in a rad aura", etc seem very misleading as to what is in the game. Since it's full of secrets I'm not sure if I missed something or not.

It is so fun and can be fun to explore and experiment with your slimes as well as gathering more slimes and building your ranch to the best it can be. However.. There is limited gameplay but it's only been out for a month or so, so I wouldn't really complain. Making a game is hard (Most of the time). I totally recommend it if you like looking at cute little creatures while feeding them and gaining money to buy more upgrades and such to expand your ranch. Yes, I understand that people don't want to pay for it for the little gameplay it offers with the cost of $20 but like I said.. It's in Early Access and it just came out a month or 2 ago (however steam was about a week).

You can play it strategically, define your own goals (achievements, total munz collected, creating every possible Slime hybrid available...) or just go nuts and run around creating mayhem and havoc.

I put off buying it for awhile, I finally gave in and I'm glad I did. I think this is going to be another one of those games I'm going to be up all night playing without noticing because it's just drawn me in so well. Everything is so calm and cute, atleast until "The Tar" appears, then all hell breaks loose with slimes everywhere. Some are nice, some are nasty and others that are imagnitive to say the least.\nStill it has got a few cons, it's very pricey for how little is there and some people maybe turned off by that. But I'm ok with that, I can see it keeping me entertained long enough to justify spending $20. The map isn't very big and is interesting but very small for this type of game. The devs have said more is planned, but currently small is the best word for it.\nI'm not calling it a must buy yet, but I probably will if the devs add what they plan to.\nIf you like cute and just want a relaxing game, it forfills that. But like I said it's pricey, so if you can live without it, so you might want to wait for a sale.","January 30","true","10.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You feed the slimes all kinds of fruits, veggies, and chickens and collect their poop known as Plorts and sell it to the ingame market with varying prices to which you can use to purchase upgrades and unlock knew areas. Find giant slimes, feed them enough to explode and collect a key use to explore new areas. But don't forget to admire the Beautiful enviornment and the slimes that reside within it!\n\nSlimes eat other slime plorts to become a slime hybrid {largo} of two species which will generate 2 plorts, 1 of each of it's two combined species. But watch out, if a Largo consumes another plort unlike the ones it makes, A Tar slime will be made and will wreak havoc on your slimes! Throw them in the water quick!\n\nThe game is rather small at the moment and can all be easily explored in at least 3-5 hours but still leave more to entertain. It is Very early beta so it is expected to be small, but soon bigger and better updates will come to bring more areas and cute and squishy slimes to the game.\n\nIf you are ready to endulge yourself in a world of crazily cute slimes, explore, and earn lots of money, then hit that Purchase Button Like I did.

The gameplay consists of exploring areas for slimes, abducting slimes, and farming for crops to feed your slimes, use said crops to feed your slimes, and sell the ♥♥♥♥ that comes out of them. It seems fun at first glance, but it gets really repetitive after a while. Not only that, but the game itself has a little amount of content for the price it's set at. Yes, it is in early access, but if you ask me, that is a ♥♥♥♥ excuse. Using that logic, I could publish a game that looks good, but only has 1 hour of content for $30. Sure, I could add more content, but you won't be guaranteed that nor will you know when the exact date that it becomes a finished product. I'll give the creators credit for creating luscious areas to explore along with the cute slimes they created, but regardless, they really shouldn't have priced this game at $20. The most you're going to get is about 2-4 hours of content, and that's if you're enjoying the game and not abducting all the slimes to profit out of them. You might be thinking "but they're going to add more content, right?". They most likely will, they aren't Code}{atch. That is a bit reassuring, but according to this development roadmap [forums.monomipark.com], even though they're working hard on this game, you're not going to get much from future updates. Alongside that, their small team is going to take a long time to accomplish all the things that the roadmap has to offer. It took them almost 2 years (excluding the recent update) to make this much content. That is impressive for a small team, but that doesn't mean that you should release a game with this much content at a price of $20. They could've either spent more time to add more content to this game and then release it, as opposed to releasing this game now and lowering several people's expectations. If you ask me, don't buy this game if you aren't too sure on buying this game, use that money on some other game.

Its really fun and really stress releasing when you can take out your daily stress by throwing slimes especially the little s*** rock slimes you rush at you and hit you. :p\n\nIts fairly easy to make money when you get your slime ranch going, I always recommend building high walls and air nets once you get enough money because the slimes will stack on each other and get out. Also if you see any wooden crates grab them and bring them back to your ranch and shoot a slime at it, it will give you goodies inside.\n\nOverall this game is really fun and my 4 year old loves to sit in my lap and watch me play it and tells me what slimes to get :) The UI is friendly and easy to use. There is lots of info about the different things you can build and slimes you can catch, so your never wondering what to do or what things do. The only glitch I have encountered is when you unlock the ranch cave to store your phosphorus slimes, if you shoot food at the ground it will glitch through the ground and the slimes can't get it, they know its there and look at it but you cant see it. Other then that no other problems with the game.\n\nNow time for the things they could improve on, I really hope they can add bigger coral cages, I feel like a slime hoarder with all my slimes cooped up haah and I think it would be a nice addition if you could buy an upgrade and make your slime cages bigger. I know you can store food in the silo but it would be nice if you could store the plorts in there, I haven't tried it yet but the description said food. It'd also be really nice if they could add multiplayer and visit others ranches :)\n\nI give this game a 10/10 (Would hoard slimes again) great graphics, barely any glitches or bugs, fun for the whole family, very user friendly!","February 24","true","8.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It has adorable slimes, cool upgrades, and TARR SLIMES ARE THE SCARIEST THINGS EVER.\nIn slime rancher, you play as a young woman named Beatrix LeBeau who travels many lightyears away to capture slimes. In this game, you have a gun. Not a shoot-em-up violent gun, but a vacuum gun. With this vacuum gun you can suck up many resources like veggies, fruits, slime plorts, and most importantly, slimes. You can upgrade this gun to hold many more of those items. You can also buy a jetpack and upgrades for that.\n\nNext, there are the slimes. In this game, there are many different types of slimes. I think at the time of 03/10/16 there are around 9 slimes, including The Tarr. You can collect all of these slimes, except for the Golden Slime and the Tarr. Also, there are larger versions of them, called Largo Slimes.\n\nIn this game, there are a wide varitity of items. There are many fruits, veggies, and meats (mostly chickens). All of the slimes have a favorite food, and only eat one type of food. An example is the Rock Slime eats all veggies, but its favorite veggie is the Heart Beet.\n\nNext, is the habitats. In Slime Rancher, you keep your slimes in corrals. There are also gardens, ponds (which you use to keep the water slime in), coops, and incinerators. There are also many upgrades for these, like auto-feeder and auto plort collector.\n\nLastly, is expansions. In this game, you save up money you make from plorts to buy expansions to the map. Don’t worry, it’s not real money. At the moment (03/10/16) there are 2 expansions. I’ll leave the rest of the secrets of the game for you to find.\nNow, since the basic information is out of the way, it’s time for some pros and cons.\n\nPros\n-Fun to Play\n-Pretty Graphics\n-Simple\n-ADORABLE\n-Many Upgrades\n-You Want to Keep Playing\n-It Makes You Feel Powerful\n-Semi-Cheap Price\n\nCons\n-Semi-Expensive Price\n-I Pretty Much Beat The Game In 6 Hours (By Beat I Mean I Got All The Upgrades and Captured All The Slimes)\n-FRICKEN TARR SLIMES (Just Kidding)\n-No Multiplayer\n\nThere are not very many cons, but they are still ones to keep in mind.\n\nConclusion: I feel that this game is very fun, cute, and entertaining, but it only has a limited amount of gameplay and it needs some further updates. I recommend you get this game, as they have announced new slimes, multiplayer, and expansions. You may only play for five or six hours, but when the new update comes out, it will just get better.\n\nZachator Rating: 9.7\n","March 10","true","13.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

Vibrant, bright colors that are easy on the eyes, cute graphics, incredibly easy to pick up. Relaxing to play at any level. Huge ammount of potential, and totally worth playing right now.\n\nLong Review: This game is great. There are not many games that I immediately fall hopelessly in love with, but this is definitely one of them.\n\nThe "down and dirty" description of the game is simple. You have a vacpack, a tool able to both vaccuum things up and spit them back out. You job is to care for and feed slimes, collecting the colorful, gem-like "plorps" they create when fed, so that you can sell these plorps for money. Sounds simple enough, but each slime is a little different, and you can even end up with big cross breeds of slimes, complicating their care. Even worse, under certain circumstances, slimes can become Tarr, a horrible menace which likes to bite you and turn all f your lovely, cute slimes into more Tarr. As the only (current) antagonist, it's horribly effective at adding difficulty and suspense without ruining the happy, cutsey mood.\n\nSpeaking of which, the visuals are stunningly cute. I mean. I'm a full-grown man and these teeney, bouncing pink slimes, with their smiles and burbling, made me grin like an idiot. Even the more intimidating slimes retain that adorable asthetic, and there's narry a time I'm playing that my dumb smile leaves my face. The HUD is very clean and simple - incredibly easy to understand in an instant, and fits into the games atmosphere very well.\n\nThe sound is also just as atmospheric, for a game about ranching slimes. Upbeat and as happy as the slimes are, the music was absolutely fantastic. Adding onto the great sound design are the sound effects. The sounds in this game are a great blend between "slightly amusing", "physically accurate", "cute as hell", and "perfectly fitting".\n\nIn fact, the only complaint that I can muster is the lack of content. It's clear from wandering around that there's a lot more of the world that's going to be made, and that's super cool. Even as it is, there's quite a bit to do, and a lot of fun to be had whilst doing it.\n\nIn its current state, If I had to describe the game in one word, it would be "fantastic". If you have $20 in your pocket, PLEASE do yourself a favor and play this game. You won't regeret it, until you come back from the range, and find all your slimes are now Tarr.

The bright colors, beautiful designs for all of the Far Far Range, and the variety of Slimes and thier behaviors, fruit/veggies/meat with their respective designs, are very interesting and cute which the game incredibly addicting to play.\n\nMy greatest complaint(s) is the amount of Slimes that spawn in an area, especially the Pink Slimes that have no limits in terms of living conditions. This absurd number (which can usuallly range from about 20-30 Pink Slimes) in a single area causes extreme lag on my laptop to the point where I have to either leave the area or close the game in fear that will cause my Graphics Card to burn out or crash. This also causes an absurd nubmer of Tarr to spawn to the point where they pratically cover EVERYTHING which makes the lag even WORSE! And it's not just the number of the Slimes, it's also the fact that there are almost always 3+ types of Slimes in one area, which makes the chances of having any Tarr spawn even higher, if not inevitable.\n\nTo the game devs, if you're reading this, could you PLEASE cut the number of Slimes to spawn per area in half, or a third - maybe even keep the Slime types separated to their respective homes? Also, if we could get maybe an extra row of Vac tanks so we could have more room for Slimes/Plorts/food, as only having 4 tanks with 20 storage space as a default is REALLY inconvinient.","May 21","true","17.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Very cute and entertaining! When you first start it gives you a very short and simple tutorial. Build a corral, Collect slimes, Feed slimes, Collect slimes poop [Plorts], sell poop upgrade corral, build more corrals and gardens and stuff, collect different slimes to get different poop to sell for different prices. <-- that is pretty much the game in a nutshell without giving away the few secrets that this game has. After you have an array of slimes and an excess of money the game kinda gets a little dull, but once again it is an early access game. I look forward to what this game will become!

She's got this pink ♥♥♥♥ flowing out, and sometimes its blue and sometimes it looks like a cat. She doesn't ♥♥♥♥ing know, all she knows is some MS paint drawings ask her for ♥♥♥♥ everyday and she has a bunch of slems in a crate and they ♥♥♥♥ Crystlers which is how she buys money with it and then spends it on more ♥♥♥♥.\n10/10 Spoiled Teen simulator. Jetpack sucks. Only two things pose a threat. The rainbow sludge that sometimes secretes from her snatch every now and then and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s which either explode like me watching documentaries or charge at you with a smile.\n\nLooking forward to the updates. Now here's an obnoxious list to fill my desires for this game which are unobtainable but I feel like I'm a special enough person that this matters.\n1) Food. I want to eat some Cuberries too. Also I want to have to drink water and have this game be survival.\n2) I'd like, within the next update, to have all slimes and areas available. $20 for an unfinished game? ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I demand more because I'm entitled.\n3) Porn. I wanna see them slaems ♥♥♥♥. Hard. Like, really raunch ♥♥♥♥. I want to see one part enter another part. Either way I'm masturbating to this game.\n4) I want a space ship. Is this not space? I want to visit other planets. Where there are other slimes. With a long line of lore to go behind it. Because my desires are unobtainable.\n5) Comic Sans. Entire games text should be Comic Sans. Fight me.\n6) Online trading with other ranchers, and there should be at least 756 variations.\n7) More MS paint drawings.\n8) The ability to fire bullets from my gun. It's a gun.\n\nGet on that, developer who's name I didn't care to look up. (Super sweet game, though.

Discovering how certain slimes work and what you need to feed them is a pretty fun process. Also, learning how to maximize your profits is quite enjoyable as well. Combining slimes also provides a unique play style depending on what  YOU  want! I have only played through one time, but I can see myself testing different slime combinations on a second play through.\n\nEarly Access:   (Version 0.2.3b).\nI am glad this game is early access, but it does come at a cost. I wouldn't say there is currently $20 worth of gameplay right now, but I have high hopes for updates in the near future. At most, you could probably play 5 hours and achieve everything the game has to offer.\n\nFinal Words:\nI am seriously looking forward to the updates for this game. Slime Rancher has so much potential to be an excellent game. I rate it 7.5/10 right now, just because of the lack of current content. If the updates continue to expand the game with the quality of content it already has, it could easily be a 9/10.","January 16","true","11.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I loved runing around feeding them. breeding them you could say but it more like mixing well slime . and turning them into hybrid slimes. and then selling the slimes excess protects produced after feeding them well I'm saying their poop.\n\nhowever as the game is right now you will be done in no time not even a day I was done with like 3 hours while not having done everything there is to do iin the game it might as well been everything there is. but I never did find those green slimes.... Anyways. there is not a lot to the game yet it is very fun. but not much. there are not many kinds slimes yet  I have to say that auto feeder kind of goes though food a little to fast. I sleep and in the morning it drops like almost all the food and then it just sits in the cage waiting to rot becouse later more food will drop so it gets time to rot. also feel like their should be some farm events that would make farm more entertaining at the least. well it does suck when yoiu get a tarr (the monster of the game) in your cage. but other then your slimes escaping there not much. of couse more land is need more slimes too maybe even a town you could go too that would be fun. anyway like I said the game is early access. but the big problem is I worried that guys working on this game will just take too long I hope not.\n\nBut hey if you enjoy harvest moon you will enjoy the game well without the dates or town or other people you should just wait for more to this game. unless just super cute slimes that you just want to pinch their cheeks they don't have is eoungh.","January 17","true","2.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Games in Alpha are often barely even games. Slime Rancher is a pleasant surprise to me.\n\nIt already has a fully functional, very smooth engine in place and a world that is actually larger and more fun than most betas. And it is in Alpha. Even if you explore the whole current world quickly, there's still a pretty decent amount to do in managing your ranch.\n\nWhile it is very good for an alpha, I think what is more exciting is its potential. The alpha currently showcases the fundamentals of what the engine and game mechanics will be capable of. As more content and choices are added, I am sure the simple and intuitive mechanics will evolve to create interesting narratives and complexities in play.\n\nOne thing I do think it needs is a little more threat. Right now, Tarrs and wild slimes pose little threat to the ranch itself as long as you take proper precautions with your greed. Air nets and high walls are nearly invincible, even against many boom largos. A well funded rancher faces very little threat from internal tarr creation, and slimes in the wild don't ever encroach on the ranch itself. But these are all things that may come later, in one form or another. There's plenty of time and this is definitely an encouraging start. I'd say it was worth the 20 dollars.","January 17","true","1.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Discovering how certain slimes work and what you need to feed them is a pretty fun process. Also, learning how to maximize your profits is quite enjoyable as well. Combining slimes also provides a unique play style depending on what  YOU  want! I have only played through one time, but I can see myself testing different slime combinations on a second play through.\n\nEarly Access:   (Version 0.2.3b).\nI am glad this game is early access, but it does come at a cost. I wouldn't say there is currently $20 worth of gameplay right now, but I have high hopes for updates in the near future. At most, you could probably play 5 hours and achieve everything the game has to offer.\n\nFinal Words:\nI am seriously looking forward to the updates for this game. Slime Rancher has so much potential to be an excellent game. I rate it 7.5/10 right now, just because of the lack of current content. If the updates continue to expand the game with the quality of content it already has, it could easily be a 9/10.","January 16","true","11.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It is a very early stage of development, but already much fun. And did I mention, how cute the slimes are?! I now will feel bad for sure, if I encounter these in other games and have to slaughter them...","January 14","true","2.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I don't even care that there isn't really anything more to do, I can't seem to stop harvesting crops, feeding slimes, and selling poo. At this point I'm seriously wealthy but I can't stop!

I demand more because I'm entitled.\n3) Porn. I wanna see them slaems ♥♥♥♥. Hard. Like, really raunch ♥♥♥♥. I want to see one part enter another part.

These cute little gelatinous blobs have populated role playing games for decades and never seemed to catch a break from the impending defeat at the edge of a sword. This time around they are being imprisoned in plasma and laser cages with the sole purpose of producing plorts that would catch a pretty penny on the intergalactic market. It is not that easy to care for the tiny critters when you have plort evolution to combat. Will this unlikely combination of farming simulator and animal breeding mysteriously create an unforgettable adventure or evolve into a scientific abomination?\n\nLet me get this out of the way: the slimes are cute. One look at this gelatins and you will be making a face usually reserved for humiliating cat videos. You would have to be heartless or down right cynical (or emotionless) to take one look at them and scoff. It helps that the cartoonish aesthetic blossoms with vibrant colors and rich detail that makes even the smallest of baby chickens look stunning. Soft melodies populate the background as playful tones from the slimes are heard over the suction of your gun. Audio used from pulling vegetables to clucking chickens add a layer of robust sound to the environment. It all looks and sounds enchanting with very little to pull you out of it (until the bugs hit).\n\nGameplay falls under three general categories: search and capture, nurturing and farm maintenance. Multiple slime types are scattered around four main areas with fruits, vegetables and chickens that will be used to feed them once brought back to the farm. It is only possible to capture original slimes, but by feeding a slime another type of plort you can evolve the slime and increase the plort yield. Selling these plorts provide the funds needed to enhance farm equipment (coops, cages, silos, gardens), purchase land extensions and upgrade your suction pack with more storage capacity, health and even a jetpack. The only real issue I had with this was how quickly the routine became repetitive and the content flew by, having gathered enough plorts to fund a fully upgraded backpack and enough rad kitten slimes to shame the craziest cat lady in a couple of hours. There is just not a lot here to fill the span of a afternoon.\n\nNot everything is rainbows and cat (slimes) in this rancher paradise with some annoying bugs and horrible slow down creeping up. Slow down happened on a number of occasions were I would save and then reload the game, only to have a very staggering movement and the world following suit. Clipping issues and terrain sticking (getting stuck to terrain) can force the player to shut down the game to fix. In time I am sure these will get ironed out, but for now the slow down is extremely annoying in more ways than one.\n\nSlime Rancher has taken a unique idea and molded it into a great concept. The slimes frolic in a natural way and look cute on a weaponry level. It is unfortunate the adorable gelatins cannot escape the quick repetitive nature of their capture and exploitation for plorts with how quickly the content goes by. For the current price, more is needed to keep the investment profitable. It is just not a recommendation I can give at the current development level. I will be checking back on these adorable critters with the hope of new lands to venture, but for now I set my slimes free to massacre the chicken population.\nPros\n\n- Adorable level is set to 11\n- Environments look polished\n- Beautiful music\n- Rather fun for the first couple of hours...\n\nCons\n\n- ... Before the repetition sets in\n- Very minor content\n- Massive slow down","May 18","false","7.1"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Cuteness, is self-explanatory, I mean, their lil' balls of slime that make adorable squeaks and noises. And when I say challenge, I don't mean stressful, I mean challenging as the game will keep you on your toes as you have to find enough food sources for your growing farm as it expands and gets new types of slimes.

You can combine slimes, feed slimes, expand your ranch, and play a simple stock martket but it doesn't really keep me playing after I've coralled every kind of slime and explored everywhere; it's currently too small and easy. Hopefully in a few more years it will get bigger and have more content but I've already fully upgraded all that I could to the point where I no longer need to leave the ranch to have a stable live stock. As for adventuring, I've explored every ounce of island that I could see and get to and they are beautiful areas but again, it's too short feeling.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I don't hate this game as there are barely any bugs and it's cute but right now it's not worth the price until it has recieved more content.","February 2","false","9.3"," 12 of 27 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","12","27","0","0"

It offers cute gameplay and exploration to see what you can find and what you can collect. However, I decided to review it and say not recommended because although it is alpha, there is little game content and I've owned the game for a couple months and there has been no new content. Perhaps I am being greedy, but the game really only offers 3-4 hours of solid gameplay and a good portion of that is just harvesting slimes and exploring. Eventually you realize that there is only 1 area you can't access and once you access it and get your honey and blast slimes, the game is over. Nothing more to do but harvest slime poops and unlock the ranch areas. If what I described sounds ok to, then I believe the game is an ok purchase, but I fear this will be a one shot game where the developers pretend to update but they never add much content. I have played a few alpha games, one being subnautica which has added a large amount of additional gameplay functions and depth. I have owned slime rancher for probably half the time and there is 0 new aspects to the game. I hope this game does receive updates since it is a good idea and has a lot of potential to be very enjoyable.","March 31","false","6.2"," 9 of 21 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","9","21","0","0"

I decided to keep it, which is why I have around 6 hours now. Anyways, here are my personal thoughts about Slime Rancher.\n\nI played the game blind. Seeing YouTubers/Commentators play games such as this is so tedious. This game doesn't look interesting when you're watching someone else play it. However, if you play it hands on, it's more enjoyable. As of now, I know that the game is still in very early access, but there aren't that many things to do after a few hours. By then, you should already have a successful ranch growing food to make your ranch hardly any better due to the fact that you have the best things possible. I already have all of the upgrades, all types of slimes, and there probably won't be any more content for a while.\n\nThere is a type of slime called the "Rad Slime" which is a radioactive slime species that will be in a future update. However, you can see how pricey the droppings of a Rad Slime are at your ranch. I don't get that. Why have some cocktease content when that particular content isn't even officially released yet? I'm not hating on the game, it's just my personal opinion. Overall, I find the game fun, but after a while, it gets bland. It just turns into piling up on cash with nothing left to do with it.\n\nIf there were more content to the game, I would find this game mostly enjoyable. I know this game is in early access, but I would prefer it to stay off of steam until it's close to out of the Early Access boundaries. To me, there is no purpose running across the map consistently going back and forth from your ranch to collect higher-tier slimes when you can just grow the best-tier slimes right there at your ranch. It seriously does get a bit stale.","February 26","false","7.5"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through." I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette.

And looking at the future plans I can't really say if I would buy it again. I had fun for 1 hour until I realized, is this it? Will the whole game be just collecting these slimes and shooting plorts to get money? I looked at the whole concept and I think this game needs more than just this farm. Other areas in the future sounds good, but will it just be more of the same? This game needs other types of interaction. Things to do.\n\nThere's no other game like this, that's for sure so kudos for something original on early access! The closest thing I can think of is Harvest Moon, but that still doesn't cut it.\n\nI'm sorry to say I asked for a refund as I don't think I will play it more. Again I looked at the whole concept, future plans and not only what is in the game now before I decided to ask for a refund. I will still follow the development of this game and if more things are added outside just more slimes and areas that sound fun I might buy it again.\n\nAnd yes the slimes are supercute.","February 6","false","1.7"," 10 of 24 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","10","24","0","0"

Now that's no bad thing what the game does it does very well, it's polished has a whole host of the core game mechanics in and working and is really fun to play. The downside though is the price vs content factor. Having blasted through most of the content, done most of the stuff and seen most of the stuff the 2.4beta has to offer inside 4 hours at a cost of £15 the game just can't be recommended.\n\nIt's a very good game and if later expansions add more content, greater depth and or greater complexity or failing that you can pick it up in a sale for under £7 then yes by all means buy it but just now I have to stick with not recommended but let me make this clear IF, the game does add more content then this WILL change.","February 1","false","4.2"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","5","14","0","0"

You go out, grab some slimes, put them in a pen, and feed them to make them poop. Setting aside the beautiful graphics, cuteness overload of the slimes, and the beautiful land to explore, there's just a really good sense of progression.\n\nAfter making some money, by selling the slime poop, you can unlock more plots. You can turn them into additional pens, gardens, chicken coops, storage, etc. Each of these options also has a bunch of useful upgrade available to purchase. After spending a few hours, I really felt like I was making great progress, and I enjoyed every minute of it.\n\nThere's also a sort of breeding mechanic to the game, where you feed poop from one kind of slime to another kind of slime, and you'll get a hybrid slime. That new slime will eat whatever kind of food the first two liked, and poop two poops each time, Additionally, those poops will be the types you'd get from the original two slimes.\n\nIt all seems rather like I'm writing notes about the game, but it's really hard to encompass how enjoyable the entire experience is, running around and taking care of things.\n\nMy advice is, you'd be hard pressed to find a game that's quite like this.","February 18","true","9.5"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","4"

By then you have seen everything, upgraded your farm and that's that.\n\nOn top of that I didn't find the farming that enjoyable. Plant a bunch of gardens and you'll have enough food to feed the few slime corrals you need to get everything there is in this game. It's hardly worth thinking about any choice to make when it comes to food, or I missed something and still got any content there is within 4 fours. The farming just feels very very casual. I know this isn't Farming Simulator 2016 but given there's pretty much nothing else to do and the game is called Slime Rancher, I'd expect a bit more from the core mechanic.\n\nSo in summary: There is potential in the game, the setting is obviously super cute but the money is better spent elsewhere, if you're looking for the most fun you can get for it.\n\nBuying Early Access is a gamble, and I personally feel this is one of the titles I should have passed on.","February 10","false","5.8"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","3","12","0","0"

This premise of this game is to vaccuum up some cute lil slimes that come in many different species. and then you are able to gain "money" by feeding them for these plorts. And thats almost the whole concept of the game. sure you can do minor improvements to your items and buy plots of lands for growing food easier.

Slime Rancher offers little in these respects\n\nThe player builds corrals to contain slimes and gardens to grow crops. These structures are prefab and can only be built in certain locations. Structure placement doesn't matter as there's no synergies between buildings. Structures may be upgraded with 4 or 5 upgrades to improve their performance.\n\nOutside of upgrades, there's nothing the player can do to influence the growth of crops and slimes. There's no risk of crop failure. Slimes aren't in danger of dying. Essentially the player runs around, throws food into corrals, collects the plorts, and earns gold. There's no challenge to this game.\n\nAccording to the roadmap more slimes and zones will be added, but I don't see anything that would add interesting challenges. I have haven't written off Slime Rancher, but for now I must give it a thumbs down. $20 is too much for a 5 hour game.","February 7","false","3.4"," 5 of 17 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","5","17","0","0"

Boom Slime. It's nearly freaking impossible. I have to commit genocide every single day by throwing all slimes I see that I already have ranched into the ocean. And it doesn't even seem to help for longer than five minutes.\n\nThis game is more of a micromanagement sim than Dwarf Fortress is. At least losing control in that game is FUN. Here, it's a friggin' chore and you know it's a losing battle.\n\nThis game is definite early access and alpha and whatever, and my review may change later on, but for right now, screw Slime Rancher.","February 2","false","7.9"," 3 of 13 people (23%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","23","3","13","2","0"

I just bought it yesterday, after debating about it for a few days, and was disappointed that as soon as I left the ranch to go explore, everything started to lag. Even at the lowest possible setting and screen resolution, along with opening the game in safemode, if I get anywhere close to where the rockslimes show up the game immediately starts to lag. I know that my computer's not the issue for the game, because it's brand new and I don't have much on here. I've even deleted some stuff from my computer because I either didn't need it, like wild tangent or photoshop, or it was just taking up too much room. I understand that this is an early access game, but if I'm going to spend $20 on a game then I want to be able to "play" it; I don't want to wait for my screen to catch up to the character, only to find out I ended up walking off a cliff and lost everything in my inventory. It might just be better to wait until the game is actually finished and then buy it. I don't think I'm going to play it again until it IS finished, maybe it won't be as bad then.

Eva Kazowski","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shayodarkleaf/","156 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nOh boy, this game. <Sigh>\nLook, I wanted to love this title. I really did.\n\nSlime Rancher is a Harvest Moon-esque game; you go out into the wild, and you capture slimes with your vacuum gun, to bring them home, put them in pens, feed them, and sell their poop for money. You use said money to expand your ranch, to upgrade your pens, chicken coops, and farms, and buy upgrades to your equipment.\n\nThe core gameplay is perfectly fine - it does exactly what it needs to do. The slimes are adorable, the controls are very well polished, and there was not a point in the game, where I felt confused; the game does a good job in easing you into the game. Its fun, it's cute, it's innocent. The music is also quite pleasant, reminding me of FFXIV:ARR's soundtrack. I was honestly surprised how much I enjoyed it.\n\n... Then I ran out of content.\n\nIn 3 hours.\n\nYes. Really.\n\nThe current Early Access build barely has any content. While getting to the limits of the current content was enjoyable, the developers are charging 20 USD / 20 EUR / 15 GBP for this title. For that sort of money, the current content is woefully inadequate. It's a skeleton of a game.\n\nYes, I understand it's an Early Access title. Yes, I understand that it got released only a few days ago on Steam. However, we had several feature complete games in the past, with vast more content released, on much lower price tags. From a raw value standpoint, compared to the E.A. successes of past, this game is woefully inadequate.\n\nThe game does, however, have promise. I would recommend that you keep an eye on it, and buy into it later, when there's a lot more to it. As it stands right now, unless the developers drop the price tag, or it goes on sale, save your money.","January 15","false","3.8"," 121 of 269 people (45%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","45","121","269","2","33"

But honestly one you can easily get bored with if not careful.  Currently it isn't worth the $20 dollars I paid due to lack of content.  It's more at this barely ranges above a trial version at times.  It MIGHT be worth $10 and in ways I wish I waited for it to be on sale before buying, if it ever goes on sale.  IF they add to it like it seems like the plan, a good amount then it may be worth it.  When I started to write this I was going to give it a thumbs up in fact until I realized during doing so how . . . well I honestly didn't get what I paid for.  Even if they added in the missing slime and the spots I found (snuck behind some) that are incomplete then it would be border worth the $20 I paid.  It's not that there is bugs, there is just . . . lacking of content.  Lacking something to keep you playing unless you're like me who goes oh, gonna max out my three silos full of different stuff.

It's cute, adorable, and has lots of huggable slimes. But at the end of the day I'm stuck with the realization that it took the developers a very long time to get the game in its current state, and that current state is both short and buggy. If you press hard you'll be lucky to pull 8 hours from the game before you get bored.\n\nI'm basing my review on the developer's target date of Fall 2016. I do not think this game will be worth $20 by that point in time. Especially with the scarcity of updates and the sheer amount of content they would have to add to make it worth that price. If this was a fully released game at this point it would be worth no less than $5, as an early access title with a more reasonable time range of Fall 2017 or Fall 2018 then $20 or even $25. At that point I could believe a game worth the value was being made.","January 26","false","8.7"," 18 of 50 people (36%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","36","18","50","2","0"

I get it- it's early access, a lot of stuff (hopefully) isn't in the game yet. But the fact that they charge $21 is insulting. I've played seven hours, and I'm bored. So bored. In addition, in order for this to not be the LAGGIEST GAME IN THE UNIVERSE, i had to put all the graphics settings down to their lowest, which didn't actually change the way the game looks all that much. due to the lag (before i remembered i could put the graphics down), doing anything was super frustrating. Tarrs are EVERYWHERE. Fighting them is fun the first few times, and their sound effects are REALLY COOL, but after those first few times, it becomes a lot less repetitive to run from them and into the next area, since they rarely follow you. I'm really dissappointed because I had several full releases like undertale and binding of isaac rebirth on my wishlist (all of which are cheaper, by the way), and I decided to test this instead. when i checked the reveiws, they were all pretty positive, so i figured i'd give it a go, and i played so long trying to find the 'fun' in this game. there isn't any. just asked for a refund. we'll see how that goes.","February 4","false","13.0"," 3 of 18 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","3","18","0","4"

Lack of content no real drive to do much after honey and boom slime captures. Achievements don't cross over to steam only in-game, the creators have walled off about 65%-75% of the game (no i really mean walls) that have "under Construction" signs placed. They also show off slimes on title screen that ARE'NT in-game yet which is a big let down, and some might call it false advertising especially since that slime's plort is on the market.\n\nThose were SOME of the cons, here are some Pros\n\n-Brings me back to days of harvest moon\n-easy controls make it playable by anyone\n-Its cute, like pokemon, harvestmoon, and spores had a baby and this was result\n-easy mechanics to learn\n-the price wont change after it is out of EA\n\nBut, i digress.\nSo does it have potential to be a Outstanding game? Yes.\nWorth the $20USD price tag no not at all.\nI did everything 20 times in 8 hrs ish and i dont know if i want more or not, i lean more to yes, but, just because i already spent the money.What really should happen is they should release a demo, to show off game instead of the $20 rip off it is ATM. But, it is your money do with it as you wish. I'll update as this game slowly gets new content because the current patch is only at 0.2.4b, only one new slime will be coming at patch 0.3.0 which is the slime i spoke of earlier the "Rad" slime.","January 24","false","8.5"," 8 of 37 people (22%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","22","8","37","0","0"

However, I unfortunately can not recommend that anybody buy the game right now. Yes, it's fun and I've had a blast with it, but there's so little content in the game (understandably, as it is a pre-alpha) and that makes the price of $20 a little too steep. I'd love to see the game grow into that price and I definitely think it will. But for the moment being I think it'd be a better idea to simply watch the development continue until you think it's worth $20.","January 14","false","1.0"," 75 of 197 people (38%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","38","75","197","5","23"

It is for games like this that I wish there was a maybe option.\n\nOverall this game is fun to play. The art style is cute, colorful, and compliments the gameplay wonderfully. However after playing the game for a few hours (I bought it before it came on steam), I discovered that I was running out of things to do. In fact I had done everything within about 4 hours. For a game like this I think that it should have more content than it currently does to make it worth getting.\n\nSo with that said, I wouldnt personally recommend getting it at this current point in development. If you are okay with only getting a few hours of gameplay and then putting it down for a while, then by all means get this game. Otherwise, wait.","January 26","false","1.1"," 2 of 24 people (8%) found this review helpful","8","2","24","0","0"

They should've done what Dirt Rally did: Start with a low price thats worth the amount of content, and then get higher until it reaches 20 for when its done. Its a lot of fun, but there is no way you can recommend this to someone for 20.","January 21","false","1.5"," 11 of 46 people (24%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","24","11","46","0","0"

The slime also have to be fed using particular foods that are either foraged or farmed. Luckily the "Poop" from slimes are valuable resources that can be traded for money - a valuble currency that could be used to upgrade and expand the farm.\n\nThere are additional gameplay offered by finding and collecting different slimes. Or feeding slimes to make hybrid slimes (this is probably the most experimental part of the game so I won't spoil it here)\n\nUnfortunately this core gameplay does get old after a 1-2 hours and the game doesn't offer much more in its current state.\n\nThe price is a very steep for the gameplay offered.","January 18","false","4.0"," 13 of 51 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","13","51","0","11"
