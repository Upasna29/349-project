For how much time this game was in developement (even by one guy), I would certainly expect more polish. Just look around the indie scene, and it won't take long to see how many crazy beautiful games are made by one person. This game is by no means in any state fit for sale. I will painstakingly go over some details.\n\nMajor issues:\n-The title. It says 'Pixel Art Action'. While the main game area is certainly classic pixel art, the character avatar pictures are not. Edit: even some of the enemy-entrance smoke and effects do not seem like pixel art. We can debate it all you want, but its a different thing. Just don't use the words 'Pixel Art' in the title - PROBLEM SOLVED.\n-Clipping between your character and literally every single object in the level is horribly off. I mean it *looks* like there is room to walk around that table, but nope, you will get stuck. And oh boy this is a problem when trying to survive, and frustrating as all get-out when added into a roguelite.\n-Wanna change to fullscreen/windowed mode mid-game? Forget it, it kicks you to the main menu, ending your run, with no warning.\n-Wanna exit the game, or return to the main menu? Forget it, there is no option to do so.\n-Wanna attack up/north or down/south? Forget it.\n-Wanna have a visual or sound clue as to when you get hit? Nothing. You need to watch your life bar at all times. It took us some time to even realise we were being hit. Onto the next point:\n-Going back to the shoddy clipping - you will get hit even when you are not touching an enemy. Its horrible.\n-Level design/generation certainly leaves something to be desired. For example, why the first three room in my very first run all end up as shops? None-the-less, they had chairs set up in such a weird way that you had to walk completely around the room in an awkward fashion. Weird broken levels.\n-Even for early access, there are way too many features 'coming soon' or 'not yet implemented'. I mean why couldn't you take 30 minutes some night and write up backstories for the characters? Thats as simple as it gets, if you ask me.\n\nRun away. I wouldn't even say keep this on your watchlist. It doesn't even promise anything at all remotely either 1) fresh, or 2) better or competitve with modern roguelites.\n\n---\nEndnote: I've also spent about an hour watching other LetsPlays, in case your issue is with my time played. We didn't need to suffer this any longer.","January 16","false","0.6"," 34 of 55 people (62%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","62","34","55","3","11"

So while I DO like it, and I can see the vision the develop has, I just cannot recommend this game at the current time right after this game launched into early access on January 15, 2016.  ..To recommend this game just because I like what the developer is TRYING to do would be dishonest and unfair to both potential customers and to the developer himself.  The game needs quite a bit of work to get it to a state where I could honestly recommend it to other people online.\n\nHere are my big reasons for the non-recommend, and suggestions to the developer:\n\nFirst off, I LOVE this kind of game and where the developer is trying to go with this game.\n\n- Too much randomness.  While I love procedural dungeons and randomly generated loot, even starting stats on starting equipment, you need to be able to make some choices like what class to start the game with, as that is currently random as well and the only way to change it is to roll the dice by restarting the game!  Ugh!  Also, leave all the random mobs and loot in, that's awesome but just set boundaries on some of it.  For example, put in a simple 'IF-THEN" statement that IF character has just began a game and level 1, THEN we can't spawn 20 mobs in the first room he enters"  ..Limits.  I don't mind 20 bats spawning after i get the feel of the game, but to play the game the first time and get my own life handed to me in 3 seconds by 20 bats almost makes me want to un-install the game and break something in RL.  ..You (dev) don't want potential customers experiencing THAT feeling in the first 5 minutes of their game experience!\n\n- Your character moves too slow, combined with the frustation of not being able to attack up and down from your characters location!  Either make new sprites and add the ability to attack up and down, OR give us about a 25%-35% increase in movement speed please.  Either solution should make this game feel and play a lot better!\n\n- Fix the bugs!  Sometimes when I'm moving right and hit space, my character jumps left right back into the mob I'm running for dear life from!  ARGH!  ..Not cool!  Same thing on the spells, some spells seem to not work when fired in certain directions.  Look at your code and fix it please.\n\n- Maybe add in a device we can find or buy in the game to allow our character to "suck in or vacuum up" all the coins and loot once we kill the mobs in a given room.  This could be really cool and add an incentive to want to finish more rooms jsut to suck in all that money!  Woot!  Woot!\n\n- Add mobs sounds/voices/insults!  Adding even cheesy sounds that come from the mobs could add a lot I think.  make the skeleton warriors say something, and use your randomness generation to have them select from perhaps a number of funny lines or insults when they spawn in and see your character!\n\nExplosions!  We need BOOMs in this game badly!  I don't care how you do it, dynamite, explosive barrels, mines, whatever!  Get some BAWOOOMS! in this game please!\n\nThat's about it from me for now, mainly.  Oh wait.. the most important suggestion to the dev:  A lower price please!  This game doesn't compete with current games that do this style of game better and this game is a dollar higher then games like the first Binding of Isaac and Overture!  I recommend a price tag of $3.99 tops, but that's up to you.  I think the increased sales you'd get at $3.99 over the current $5.99.. as well as the lower amount of refund requests would pay off bigtime for you!\n\nBy the way, my early access score on this game was a 39%.  Watch my video to see how exactly I scored it if you want to see how I came up with that score for this game!\n\nPlease keep working on this game dev!  I want to re-evaluate in the coming months and be able to give it a lot better score!  ..Rememeber, that "value" is the most important part of every score I give games, psst.. your price [..wink, wink]  ..Thanks again for the free evaluation copy of this game dev, and please take my negative score as inspiration to make this game better!","January 18","false","0.8"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","67","12","18","5","0"

Active Developer, but it's too raw still. 2/5\n\nThe "Meat & Potatoes" Review:\n\nThe game was just practically unplayable on release date, so I waited a day or two to drop a review. I am glad I did. While I still cannot recommend this game in it's current state, I can at least point out that the developer has been incredibly responsive and active in updating the game to try and fix it quickly and efficiently. The visuals and sounds are what you expect from a game like this, it doesn't pretend to be artsy at all. That's not the problem, the problem is in fact the gameplay itself. The dungeons are perhaps TOO random, which I realize sounds odd at first, but when you have spawned multiple playthroughs that begin with multiple shopkeepers in a row before you even get to a single encounter, and then your first encounter is nearly a dozen enemies which obviously quickly overwhelm you and end your game before it even gets rolling. The clipping/hitbox issues were even worse, making it impossible to collect items after a battle. Fortunately, the second problem there has already been somewhat addressed, just not enough for my tastes yet. Also, while your enemies can cause damage to you from any direction, your attack is very limited. There is no ability to attack up/down or North/South at all. Only to the left or right, which makes some rooms virtually impossible due to enemy placement. All in all, it is just to raw still to recommend. On the bright side, the developer is active so you can at least take a wait & see approach to this one and come check it out again later and see how much it has progressed. Merely yesterday I would've given this a 1/5, but already it is up to 2/5 for the recent, quick update.\n\nHappy Gaming!","January 17","false","4.4"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","12","19","0","3"

It aims to be a Binding of Isaac style room-to-room action game with RPG elements like different classes, levelling up and gaining increasingly powerful equipment. But very little has been implemented. Your character is sluggish and can only attack left or right (!). Most enemies do essentially the same thing: walk up to you to try to hit you, with the occasional slow ranged attack. Since you outpace them, the game consists of kiting them around (or getting them stuck behind furniture) while you slowly chip away at their health. Graphics, sounds and music are basic, there's no minimap, and overall it's just a monotonous experience with no end goal.\n\nIn its current state, there's no point paying for it. If the developer wanted to gather attention and feedback from more players, this could have been released as a free demo. The dev is actively responding to feedback, hopefully the game will shape up in future.","January 21","false","2.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It's waaaay too rough with too little to do and the balance is extremely off in many areas.  However, this game seems to have some potential and I will be revisiting this game in the coming months to re-evaluate my review and see how it has grown.  Unfortunately, at the time of writing this review, this game falls straight into my list as being released TOO early, even for early access.\n\nAlso, this is a roguelite, not a roguelike.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8jEnuP-5qs\n\nTo the game's credit, there is a tutorial but the tutorial forgets to explain a few very key features including the ability to full heal at campfires (I found this on accident) and a sprint button (which I also found on accident).  Discovering these two features turned the game from nearly-unplayable difficulty to mostly a cakewalk.\n\nSpeaking of the sprint button, it feels like a wasted feature.  It costs no resources and the game feels lethargic and syrupy when you're not sprinting, so you have zero reason not to use it.\n\nCombat feels more like a brawler than a top-down action game, because you're limited to left and right attack directions.  It's a bit frustrating, but seems to be a deliberate design choice.  I don't agree with it, but I came to accept it when I starting thinking of the game more like a brawler than a roguelite.  The combat is pretty shallow, too.  Aside from your (very situational and high-cost) spells, you're pretty much relegated to hit and run tactics: move in, swing, move out, repeat.\n\nEnemies drop gold and XP which you are forced chase down.  That's never a fun mechanic and, to make it worse, there are VERY expensive unlocks that take a long time to get that will mitigate this need by giving you a vacuum ability that, according to the tooltips, cost your stamina resource.  Blegh.\n\nWeapon balance is very VERY off, such that there is absolutely zero reason to use anything but the fast-attacking weapons.  The slow weapons take up to 2 full seconds or more to fire again, which is so soooo not worth it.  They don't even do that much more damage than the fast weapons!\n\nAlso, as far as I could tell, the game is endless right now.  With a decent gear upgrade and the hit and run tactic and a minimal amount of practice, you won't die.\n\nKey provided by the developer.","January 19","false","1.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I am addicted to this game and wish it the best of luck through its life.\nP.S. if you want to know why the name is so fitting just get in a room with 2 Legendary weapons, make your choice wisely because only 1 will go with you the other stays behind and there is NO turning back. :)","January 20","true","9.5"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","1","5","0","0"

If the game got cleaned up and fixed it could be lots of fun, but as of this review - nope.\n\nThe graphics are simple but nice\nThe soundtrack (I only heard 1 song) is nice\nIt looks like there's a lot of opportunity for unlocking characters and progression\n\nbut it's not good yet.\n\nThere's no up/down attacking, so you just have to try to line yourself up with the monsters horizontally and hit them that way, but the hitboxes/aiming are a bit screwy.\n\nFirst char I tried was an archer, and your attack speed is SOOOO slow - and then you have to hope the arrow doesn't go into the wall behind you, or a nearby table, or just 1 pixel too high/low.  It's ridiculous and frustrating. Unplayable.\n\nI could use my special skills about once each before running out of stamina or whatever they cost, and that didn't seem to replenish\n\nI found a claw weapon, but I thought it was gloves.  The game wouldn't let me pick them up/equip so I thought it was bugged and quit to the main menu.\n\nNext I tried a sword & board guy, his attack speed is okay, but it's melee, so you have to get up close and personal, which is the only spot you're in danger.\n\nMade it further with him, found a few of those claw weapons, as well as a helmet that I couldn't seem to equip (it said it required a cuirass?)\n\nI also found 2 ornate rooms, one with a green chest, one with a red, and I couldn't seem to open either.  So it was a huge sense of excitement followed by a sustained "aww this sucks"\n\nsaw at least 3 NPCs, but couldn't seem to interact with them at all.  Trainer, Apothecary(?) and Blacksmith(?), sooooo.....no idea.\n\nOnly saw 3 monsters - bats that just fly straight towards you (slowly)\n-robed figures that just walk straight towards you (slowly), or some of them shoot a bolt\n-plants that come out of holes in the wall and shoot left/right\n\nThey still managed to kill me.\n\nThird try is a "mage" who just uses a dagger, so not really magey at all (yet?).\n\nI left a room before picking up an item by accident, and couldn't go back for it :(  But it was a shield so I probably wasn't able to use it anyway.\n\nI saw a 4th monster!  A skeleton or maybe it was an armored guy.  It moved FASTER!  got killed by the 2nd one of those.\n\nAttack-speed seems to be a huge problem in this game.  I intentionally stuck with the starter dagger just for a more frequent attack speed.  I found a powerful axe, a powerful sword, a powerful bow, but if I wanted to use those, then if I either miss, or don't kill a thing in 1 hit, there's gonna be a problem while I run around defenseless until I'm able to attack again.\n\nStill nothing to do with those NPCs.  Maybe they're like crafting stations?  I found a couple non-equippable items that I think are crafting materials, but you can only carry 1 at a time and I never found out what to do with 'em.\n\nIf an enemy spawns inside you, free damage!  And there doesn't seem to be any way to heal.","May 7","false","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
