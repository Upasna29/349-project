"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfuzzytiger/recommended/6270/","thatfuzzytiger","Hobbes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfuzzytiger/","3197 products in account","Some games take hours before a decision can be made. Some take just minutes. Some games are glorious. Some...\n\n... some are just hideous.\n\nDucati World Championship is the most putrid, plagueridden piece of decomposed penile tissue I have had the misfortune to review. I wish that was hyperbole. It's the gaming equivalent of lutefisk. I'm sure someone, somewhere enjoys this game, that someone probably lives in a dark cave, and lives on a diet of raw fish. They probably want to know what I have in my pockets.\n\nThis game is often bought as a gag gift, for good reason, it's cheap, usually less than a euro or a dollar, it has a horrible metacritic rating, sub 30's, and like another gag gift, bad rats, it's an odious piece of garbage. The stink of sewage can be sensed long before the game has had the chance to imprint its' accursed signature upon your hard drive, and believe me, once it has, uninstalling it will be something you follow with religious rituals. You may need to burn the hard drive and scatter the ashes somewhere sacred, just to make sure the game doesn't come back from the dead.\n\nThe store video promises that we'll be in for a treat, giving us glorious footage of a badly rendered CGI woman who wears what looks like two strips of shiny gaffer tape over her wobbly bits to ensure that the video doesn't get an R rating, and only occasionally a look at the bikes in what is a bike racing game, all the while subjecting us to some hideous "rawk" music (and the music follows you into the game, it gets worse, it's musak, it's musak for videogames).\n\nBut wait, it gets better. This horrific satanic mutation requires you to delve into the install folder and set it to compatibility mode, if you're in windows 7, and not what you'd expect. Normally compability means XP. NOT SO here, dear reader. Nope, here, it's compatibility for windows Vista.\n\nLet's pause to consider this. A game that requires windows vista compatibility. Windows Vista. The Operating System from hell. In case you needed any clearer a signpost, this is it, this is "Abandon hope all ye who enter here", and hope is quickly extinguished. The resolution caps out at 1680x1050, which for current day computers means you're going to be upscaling to get it to fit onto 1920x1080, it's filled with some horrific motion blur, the graphics would look modern on an Atari Jaguar. Yes, that -thing-. That dared call itself a console back when the original Playstation was owning face back in the day.\n\nThe control system is poorly documented, and was designed by someone who had no idea how racing game controls SHOULD work and probably didn't CARE. Requiring you to fumble about like some poor sod in the dark hunting for the light switch in the bathroom whilst trying not to urinate all over the floor, when you do finally figure out what keys make the bike actually -go- in the relevant directions you find that there's zero smoothness in the response, the bike literally slides over the course like it's 1989 and we're playing ENDURO RACER ON THE ***KING SINCLAIR SPECTRUM WITH TAPE LOADING GAMES. ARE YOU HEARING ME? A SODDING 128K MACHINE DID A BIKE EXPERIENCE BETTER THAN YOUR ***KING DUCATI ***KING WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP YOU ***KING USELESS ***KING ***KERS.\n\n*ahem*\n\nI'm trying not to completely lose my temper here. I know that the programmers probably tried their best, and that people invested time and effort... oh who am I trying to kid, this is shovelware. It's the lowest of the low. It's frothing knobcheese of the most torrid variety and like Bad Rats, only barely qualifies as a "game" and only qualifies as "entertainment" if you're looking to put up youtube videos of you suffering through playthroughs to give other people a cheap laugh. If that's something you want to do, go ahead, be my guest. BE MY ***KING GUEST. BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT? I QUIT. ***K THIS GAME. ***K THIS ***KING GAME. NO MORE. I WILL PLAY THIS NO MORE. IT WILL TAKE UP NO MORE OF MY TIME AND NO MORE OF MY HARD DISK. I CONSIGN THEE TO THE FIRES OF HELL AND MAY IT BURN THERE FOREVER MORE.\n\n...\n\nAnd if you really need to ask? No. No I do not recommend this "Game".","March 23, 2014","false","0.6"," 172 of 222 people (77%) found this review helpful 39 people found this review funny","77","172","222","39","10"

Just save your money and the 2874mb it takes to download this putrid piece of s♥♥t. Don't even buy this as a joke, you'll regret it faster than Sonic on speed. Do not make the same mistake as me. Just because it was on sale for $1.24, do not buy it. No one deserves to be tortured by playing this. I wouldn't even call this a game, it's a mish-mash of quick, untested coding they managed to jam up and price it for $4.99. Even if this is on sale for $2, $1 or even $0.01, do not buy it. You regret it instantly. Controls are so buggy, I would rather choose to play Cheetamen II in a locked prison cell. Not even Silver Dollar Games or LJN can make a s♥♥ttier game than this. The sound of the motorbikes don't even sound like motorbikes. I would rather listen to chalkboard scraping. I would protest for a refund to all the people who bought this, but because of the Steam no refund policy, I cannot. I've only played a couple minutes and I deleted it straight after. I'm even embarassed to have this product on my games library. You'll have more fun playing with rocks. I am not even joking. If you don't buy this, that instantly makes you a smarter person than I am, because I wonder what kind of drugs someone needs to take to enjoy this. Anyone can make a more enjoyable game out of Microsoft Powerpoint. Anyone who played this for over 2 hours deserves a medal.

This game is definately worth 50 cents.  No way to exit a race.  You use Q to go forward, but the arrow keys to turn.  The soundtrack is some orchestral chick rock band. I think their Janitors decided to make a game, and then decided they had better things to do and outsourced this game's development to a couple 8 year olds in somalia, who were using a Pen and paper flipbook made of hippo toenails to program.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hexelf/recommended/6270/","Hexelf","Hexelf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hexelf/","813 products in account","This game is not nearly as bad as everyone says. The handling takes some getting used to, the commentary is best when it's turned off and the game is best played with a 360-pad along with the knowledge that the P-key brings up the in-game menu which you can use to exit or restart races.\n\nThe game has several modes, including a career mode, championship and a challenge mode. The championship is a pre-determined series of increasingly difficult races, the challenge mode tasks you with performing various timed trials such as wheelies. The most interesting mode however is the career mode, which has you competing in a variety of race types while working your way through several license classes.\n\nYou get to create your own racer for this mode and you earn new bikes by completing races. These new bikes allow you to enter even more races and once you've completed all of them, you move into the next class - the goal being to eventually win The Race Queen - the girl from the intro.\n\nThe races can be as simple getting to first place within two laps, to a multi-stage endurance race where your performance carry over between stages, meaning your bike or even your character can become beat up over time. You can enter the pit stop to allow either your character or your bike to recover. You also gain nitro by racing well. Staying on the road gives you a slow but steady build of nitro that you can use when you need a boost, driving outside the road will drain the meter quickly, and performing stunts such as wheelies will make it rise dramatically.\n\nThe visuals for this game are quite old-fashioned but they did employ the RenderWare engine for the game and it does a good job of maintaining a smooth frame-rate with no pop-ups to be seen anywhere. The stages are pretty varied too, with plenty of locales like arenas, deserts, tropical, mountain- and country-side tracks -  and in some of them you can literally see for miles into the background.\n\nIf you like classic arcade racers (especially those made by Sega and Namco) and don't mind old-school graphics, taking chances with low budget titles and dealing with an initially harsh learning curve - then this game might be for you.","September 8, 2014","true","4.2"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","15","18","0","1"

It placed its exhaust pipe to my pipe and blew it clean off.\nYou'd be forgiven for thinking this is just a mere racing game, but the underlying plot is one of gripping suspense and subtle romance.\nAt the new game selection, you're told to pick a girl to race with. Be extremely careful in doing so, for picking anything but a caucation female will make the romance part of the game a real challenge.\nAfter that, the story slowly unfolds and you'll find yourself moved to tears as you discover the true nature of the game. Not to win a simple bike race, nay, to discover your humanity.\n\n10/10 - Inspiring plot, interesting character development, a love story that shouldn't be ignored.","July 15, 2014","true","5.1"," 29 of 48 people (60%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","60","29","48","5","3"

Artematica, creator of Ducati World Championship, is such an artist.\n\nDucati World Championship is a game that innovates the racing game genre. The gameplay is simple to comprehend yet truly shows and rewards mastery of the gameplay mechanics, with crisp and fluid controls to boot. The graphics, while seemingly outdated, provide a powerful and immersive asesthetic that makes the player feel as if they are actually in the game. The scenery is breathtaking in its simplistic beauty with vivid and evocative colours. The soundtrack is incredible with unique and ground-breaking orchestral pieces that truly inspire passion and wonder. The story is a gem not seen in videogames, period. The story maintains a realistic nature while exploring thought-provoking questions that have plagued society for ages, possibly since the dawn of man. The characters are relatable with interesting idiosyncrasies that truly make them seem real and relatable. Character development and depth is common theme throughout the story.\n\nIn short, Ducati World Championship is a magnificent, towering achievement for video-games, it's unique, creative, and memorable. If you haven't purchased this game, you are not only hurting yourself, but those around you.","January 26","true","347.9"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","71","10","14","5","0"

Overall I would personally rate it a 11/10 due to its replay factor, and I am surely gonna kick back and race some more dudes on Ducati for sure!","December 20, 2014","true","0.1"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","46","6","13","3","0"

You will unlock new bikes and drivers via career mode, and all the other modes are interesting in their own ways. Yes, the controls are a little touchy, and a few of the bike setup options seem to make very little difference. The graphics are not pretty or up to date. But with that said, I've been having great fun with it. In career mode, you have driver health and motorcycle damage to keep in check. Almost every race so far in C Class has unlocked either a new bike or a new driver for Championship mode. While I haven't finished the game yet, I have definitely had great fun with what I have played. I usually play very modern driving games like Gran Turismo 6, GRID 2, MX vs. ATV, Motorstorm, etc. Despite it's very visual age, this game is still fun if you like to race. It is a bit strange and is sponsored by a specific motorcycle company. But the strangeness makes it charming and the Ducati sponsorship means great bikes to ride and unlock.\n\nHighly recommended for fans of motorcycle racing games, especially if you don't mind slighty better than PS1 graphics and controls. I think it's great, but your experience may vary.","August 10, 2014","true","3.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I was hoping for a decent motorcycle racing game, nope not even close.\n\nIf you have problems with the game starting, it's because you have to go to "C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\ducati world championship" and set the compatibility mode of Ducati.exe for Windows XP.\n\nOnce you've done that, you get to watch the cut scenes that look like they're from a Dreamcast game. Then you get to customize your character by selecting different helmets and "faces". I started the game with a quick race and was confronted with graphics that look worse than the original Playstation.\n\nI used my xbox controller, but the controls are awful. You have to use the "A" button to accelerate, no triggers for you. "X" is your nitro boost, which fills up from driving at top speed. Also the start button makes you look backwards. In fact, once in a race I couldn't figure out what key could bring up the menu to leave the game. I was forced to alt+tab to close the game.\n\nI can't tell you to, or not to, buy this game. Every game is worth getting for the right price, and for me that price was around a dollar, though now I'm thinking that dollar would be better spent on a coffee.","March 1, 2013","false","0.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Sure a bit older, but works great with Gamepad, decent graphics for being older, nice controls and speed and handling, plus a large variety of courses. I suggest playing Career Mode first, Quick Race is fun but it takes time to learn the fast bikes and handling. Nice small game though and easy install.","May 1","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
