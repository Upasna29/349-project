Stronger weapons have, in general a longer cooldown, etc\nThere is often a delay between firing and the projectiles actually hitting their targets, so smart aiming and predicting your targets\' movements is essential.\nIt is based on the tower defense gameplay but unlike most tower defense games you dont just place them and wait what happens. You have to actively destroy your enemies.","June 1","true","1.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

It's a difficult feeling to describe how well this game seems to coalesce all its various parts into such a harmonious experience. The audio track, the visual experience and the gameplay blend together to deliver quite a satisfying gaming session. I guess that's the benefit of being a one person dev-team, you have the opportunity to create and refine the experience into exactly what you want without hindrance.\nA very talented solo indie-dev.\n\n","June 2","true","5.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The amount of money he's asking for this little gem is a pittance; I spend more on breakfast every day.

Especially the "survive X time" and "get X Ram" challenges can end up being a game of see and wait. Higher difficulty does alleviate a bit of this, but there are some issues with that...\n\n..as the higher difficulties are flat out "upgrade" locked, and impossible if you don't unlock the higher end upgrades, so there is no reason to revisit an older challenge once you complete it at gold, because it'll only become easier due to higher upgrades.\n\nThe upgrade system is the games weakest part, being a flat and linear upgrade system. No reason to mix and match and no thinking needed. Just get the next one asap to make challenges easier / possible to complete. I feel this is also the part where the game lets me down the most. I have no reason to "switch it up" based on a challenge, i know that if i fail, i just wait to upgrade and that does remove some of the tension of otherwise pretty compelling game play.\n\nAnd while the game is limited in it's scope, the game play and map design does make up for it a fair bit. With towers being restricted, resources limited and a need to switch between Shooting manually using towers, getting resources and balancing these aspects, the game throws in a few curve balls with map design and unit variety (in mechanic, if not look and feel). Forcing you to be active across the map and keep track of several things at the same time makes this game shine at it's best.\n\nIt feels great to switch between dropping a tower, jumping to a missile to blow up a clump of enemies, using a CPU module to start my resource chain, switching to my machine gun to take out a roaming ram unit switching to different part of the map to make sure i'm not getting overwhelmed on that side... it's pretty good fun and most challenges take 5-10 minutes to complete - win or lose.\n\n\nOverall a nice and fun casual experience for short bursts, not something i would play hours on end, but not a bad game to enjoy in short bursts.","June 1","true","9.7"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","7","13","2","0"

You can then continu to rain hell from the sky while also building automated turrets to intercept enemies that get by.\n+ You can upgrade your weapons, turrets, and so fourth with currency you get from completing challenging and levels\n+ Great Electronic Soundtrack\n+ Personally, I feel this game is really refreshing to a rather stale TD Genre\n\n- I found it a bit strange that each level continue to plays even after you complete your objectives and will continue until your OS dies or you manually \"Shutdown\". While not really a problem I sort of felt like I was quitting out or aborting rather than finishing the level (which seems to go on endlessly until you shutdown).\n- The \"bosses\" are not very threatening, and could probably be improved a bit.","June 1","true","1.5"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

(Sorry about that, I just love writing long stuff.)\n\nFor a game developed by only ONE person, I am indeed impressed by how he managed to create something as awesome for a small game as Artificial Defense. I've been supporting/following this game ever since its early development. I admit, I was interested in its simple concept: Top-view shooter game where you shoot at things trying to intrude your system (base) about a computer (the player) trying to defend itself from waves of triangular viruses that want to make the computer explode. (This would be funnier if it features a virtual BSOD)\n\nGoodies(Things I liked about the game)\n\n‚Ä¢ Interface has simple design, with right combination of colors such as light blue and white, or yellow and gray, which makes the letters and signs visible.\n‚Ä¢ Simplicity in graphics and animation, requiring almost minimal system (the real one) requirements.\n‚Ä¢ Bits of humor in certain descriptions. (Herb needs a lesson, too.)\n‚Ä¢ Mixture of attack/defend. No rush. It's only a bunch of creeps approaching your OS from all directions.\n‚Ä¢ Ability to choose system upgrades (weaps, def. towers, hardware) with freedom, in between missions/levels.\n‚Ä¢ 7 different maps/levels with different soundtracks and difficulties.\n‚Ä¢ Groovy techno-style (correct me if I'm wrong with the genre) background music.\n‚Ä¢ Difficult and challenging gameplay. (Git gud)\n‚Ä¢ Rage-inducing worms.\n\nBaddies(Some issues/Things that I dislike. Of course, I don't want to be biased.)\n\n‚Ä¢ Interface can be a bit confusing at first look. I guess it happens to almost all games, anyway.\n‚Ä¢ Some tasks in missions can be found repetitive.\n‚Ä¢ Rage-inducing worms.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed playing the game and I've spent quite some time with it.

I noticed myself sitting and nodding in beat with the music as soon as I got into the menu, and that continued ingame.\n\nThe tutorials were easy to understand but didn't prepare me for the first actual level of the game. It was quite dificult since I didn't have the tools available I had in the tutorials. That's not a huge problem though as you gather points to buy improved tools and weapons  from every mission played, even if you fail.\n\nAll in all this seems like a fun take on tower defense games.

It's really the kind of game you get better and better at, both through upgrades and through skill.

The game feels pretty challenging because it has a "last as long as you can" mechanic with more and more chaos to deal with as each game progresses. There is a precision component which means as you get more frantic and stressed you need to keep your cool and be accurate with your aiming.
