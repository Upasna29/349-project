This is not inherently a bad thing, but it should be noted that this game does a few things differently:\n\nFirstly, you have less control over your soldiers than you do in Synapse. Sometimes your soldiers will feel like doing things that you didn't tell them to do. This can sometimes be good, other times bad. For example, I sighed relief when one of my soldiers was smart enough to turn around and shoot at an enemy that had flanked him, but other times I wished that he would keep his original target and let his buddies take care of the bad guys creeping up on him.\n\nSecondly, there is no way to order your soldiers to wait. This can be a problem if you want to synchronize time-sensitive manuevers (for example, rushing into a room after your teammate's flashbang has blown). You can order your soldier to walk in a little circle to burn time, but that's not always viable when you're pinned down by enemies. This means that the tactical aspect is a little watered-down compared to Synapse.\n\nThirdly, this game has character progression. Soldiers accumulate experience, gear, and level-up. This process is fairly enjoyable, and there is also an extensive character customization system which allows you to pick your soldiers' clothes, hats, weapons, accessories, etc (there are no female characters are available though, which is somewhat disappointing). Synapse had none of this.\n\nFourthly, there is no "preview" feature. This is unfortunate, because planning attacks before you finalized your turn was an extremely useful feature in Synapse. In Breach & Clear, you just kinda have to visualize everything beforehand and roll the dice. Sometimes this is fine, as this game is far more forgiving than Synapse is - You won't die in one hit if you make a mistake, for example, as all your soldiers have health and evasion stats that help them survive longer.\n\nLastly, there is no multiplayer. At all. Which sucks. This game seems perfect for playing with your friends, but instead you only have the option of playing against the lackluster AI.\n\nSo, I'm kinda torn on Breach & Clear. It does some things right, but it is also lacking in other ways. Frozen Synapse is a superior game overall, but it isn't going to give military genre fans their fix of atmosphere the way this game will.\n\nIn this respect, that's where this game does right - It does deliver a solid tactical experience against a backdrop of beautifully rendered (and diverse) hand-crafted maps.\n\nSo really, my choice to recommend this game comes down to the question of whether I had fun playing the game or not. At the end of the day, my answer is yes - I definitely did have fun playing Breach & Clear.\n\nI'm just glad that I didn't pay full price. I'd recommend you do the same.","July 26, 2015","true","8.0"," 75 of 81 people (93%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","93","75","81","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mafiaguy7/recommended/266130/","mafiaguy7","Mister Maf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mafiaguy7/","235 products in account","Breach & Clear is an interesting marriage of Frozen Synapse's hybrid turn-based/real-time style of tactics gameplay with XCOM: Enemy Unknown’s customizable class-based soldiers and carefully-constructed mission levels, then given a Counter-Strike terrorists-vs.-special-forces makeover - right down to the almighty flashbang grenade.\n\nUpon first starting up the game, the player will be greeted by a series of screens to set up their first squad.  They can choose from a variety of different special forces outfits from around the world, from the American Navy SEALS to the German Kommando Spezialkräfte, among others.\n\nThe player can choose the faces, names, and soldier classes for each member of their 4-man squad.  Each of the six classes has a unique role to play with their special abilities and passive traits, and having to choose which to bring and which to forego should be carefully considered, as it will significantly affect how you approach different situations from that point on.\n\nEvery mission starts by selecting which entry points to place the soldiers at before they storm the room, or otherwise enter the combat area.  Enemies inside rooms that have no open doors cannot be seen (conversely, every enemy in an outdoor area can be seen), meaning you will sometimes be storming a building blind.  As such, the player has to carefully survey the map layout, note cover near to every door, and account for every angle an enemy might be waiting at before breaching the entrance.  Sometimes it might even be favorable to split your team into two groups of two as opposed to keeping all four together.\n\nAt the start of each turn, the player will issue orders to all four of their soldiers during a “planning phase” - where to move (and along what path - an option XCOM sorely neglected), what direction to face, what inventory equipment or special abilities to use.  When everything is set, all four men will simultaneously execute your orders in real-time during an “action phase”, as will the enemies act.  Some of the enemies’ actions are proactive, and some are reactionary - especially in response to any grenades you throw.  This is unlike Frozen Synapse, where the enemy soldiers will follow their turn’s orders to a T regardless of what yours do.\n\nThis also leads to an important interesting factor introduced in Breach & Clear that XCOM notably fails to consider: noise.  Guns are loud, and if you hear a bunch going off in the next room, most militiamen would go check out what’s going on.  Every gun you give your soldiers and some modifications you can apply to said guns have a “noise” trait which affects how loud the weapon is.  The louder the guns in your squad, the more likely an unseen enemy in another room will come and investigate.  This can lead to some real “Oh shi-” panic moments if your men are caught flanked or out of cover when this happens, especially in areas with many closed doors and little cover - such as the living quarters on a cargo ship.  To account for this, the player must carefully position their soldiers to cover the squad’s flanks at all times, or trade in some lethality for low-profile, silenced guns.\n\nThere is a half cover/full cover system similar to the one in XCOM: different objects in the environment will either provide moderate or significant protection to the soldier behind it, depending on the object’s size.  There is one notable difference to XCOM’s implementation, especially on the higher difficulties: barring sniper rifles, soldiers shooting at each other from cover to cover will often have a very hard time actually scoring hits.  This forces the player to use all of the tools at their disposal to outmaneuver the enemy and gain flanking shots, rather than simply relying on a boosted aim stat.  This really strengthens the tactical depth of an otherwise relatively simple set of mechanics, which is great - it makes the fundamentals easy to grasp, but achieving victory is a very deliberate process that rewards planning and smart execution.\n\nThe soldier progression and customization system adds that XCOM-like personal attachment to your men.  As the player completes missions, they will unlock items for your men to use.  These items range from weapons and attachments to body armor and helmets to cosmetic-only elements like camouflage and sunglasses.  Each man can also be kitted out with two inventory items - typically a grenade of some kind or a medkit, or a revival defibrillator if your squad lacks a medic.\n\nCompleting missions will also earn each soldier XP.  As they level up, they will unlock new class-specific passive bonuses and, eventually, a powerful special ability that can only be used once per mission (for example, a Fireteam Leader can provide a “morale boost” that grants a large stat bonus to the entire squad for one turn).\n\nLeveling up soldiers also allows the player to choose what stats to upgrade on a given soldier, whether it be how fast they can acquire targets, how far they can run in a turn, the effectiveness of their class bonus, etc.  This lets the player choose whether they want to make a squad of jacks-of-all-trades, or to specialize their soldiers to excel at certain things at the expense of others.  For example, Breachers (the grenade-tossing class that often leads the charge) might find specializing in health and target acquisition useful so that he can more effectively fight as he crosses open ground.\n\nWith the variety of mission environments offered by the game’s numerous mini-campaigns, collecting a range of gear - sniper rifles, machine guns, loud and silenced weapons, fast-but-light and slow-but-sturdy body armor, etc. - is important to maintaining a flexible force, especially considering that every level can be played in three different scenarios with varying levels of enemy numbers and emphasis on speed.  Overall, the persistent soldier system and surprising amount of content offers a considerable amount of gameplay for such a small title.\n\nDespite all these features, Breach & Clear is not without its flaws.  The relative simplicity of the movement system compared to the one in Frozen Synapse - mainly the lack of an option to tell a soldier to wait a couple seconds before moving - can sometimes make synchronizing your soldiers’ actions difficult.  This is especially noticeable when attempting to follow a flashbang grenade into a room; it won’t stun your own soldiers, but it will give the enemy a moment to pepper your men with bullets as they enter before the grenade goes off.\n\nAdditionally (and this was an enormous gripe that I had with XCOM: Enemy Unknown, too), all the voiceovers are in a standard American English dialect, regardless of which international commando outfit your soldiers belong to.  Not only, but the vast majority of weapons in the game are ones used by the United States and Canada, despite the wide international breadth of options for the men themselves.  This can likely be attributed to the game originally launching with only American and Canadian task groups, with the others being added only later.  Given the size of the team making the game (spoiler alert: it’s pretty small), this is somewhat understandable, but it's still disappointing that I can't arm my Spetsnaz team with the latest Kalash AK-12s and have them bark responses in their native tongue - or at least in a cheesy Russian accent.\n\nThese blemishes, however, are relatively minor stumbles on what is, at its core, a very satisfying experience.  While the soldier progression system isn't quite as fleshed out as XCOM's, and the unit movement system not quite as intricate as Frozen Synapse's, the two fused together with the game’s own handful of unique features make a very fun and surprisingly deep tactics game that is both easy to pick up and complex to conquer.  For only $15, I would consider Breach & Clear worth checking out for any fan of tactics or small-scale strategy.","September 23, 2014","true","18.4"," 74 of 87 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","74","87","0","5"

I do like the game, and I will probably get 10-20 hours of gameplay out of it, but I can already spot some problems.\n\n- Poor weapon variety. There's lots of AR-15 and M4 varieties, with similar stats, but no AK-47 (despite that you can play as spetznaz) or weapons of other origin than US/west Europe.\n- Poor gear variety. With a few exceptions, you can add something that adds a single value. For almost the same price, you can get a bonus of 5, 10 or 15. Why would anyone ever buy the +5 gear?\n- Poor mission variety. 35 SMALL maps. 3 different missions on each (hunt, defuse, extraction).\n- Bland AI. Nothing surprising about it's moves.\n- No sidearms, no magazine count, no reloads.\n- Poor use of grenades. If you want to use a flashbang, then use it on turn 1 and move into the room on turn 2. There's no way to tell your squad to wait until after the detonation before they move in. Which leads to the next point...\n- Poor ways to coordinate your movements. You can't tell op 1 to wait until op 2 arrives and then move together, unless you wait a full round. Which might hurt your score.\n- Poor damage model. Everyone always fight to the death. Injuries have no negative effect, armor only adds HP.\n\nNone of this is game-breaking, but my impression is that they should have added more features and more complexity to the game, and definitely bigger/more maps.

Not recommended.\n\nThe game just feels unfinished. It seems to have had a few good ideas that never got implemented or got abandoned later. It lacks a lot of essential features of a tactical combat game and some features (breaching charges, flashbangs, no reloading weapons) are implemented in a very sloppy, bad and pointless manner. The game is also short, missions lack variety.\n\nOverall the game feels rushed, sloppy and incomplete. I had to check back the store page to make sure its not an early access alpha game. This game had potential, but I'm very disappoint that the devs released it in its current state.\n\nIf you want a tactical close combat game, go play good old SWAT3 or "Door Kickers" which is available on steam and a much better game on the same topic.\n\n\nFor a more in-depth review, check the pros and cons list.\n\nCons:\n\n- Worst of all, you cannot coordinate and time the moves of your squad mates with one another. You can forget about simultaneous entry into a room from two doors. You can forget about a SWAT-style "throw in flashbang and then whole squad moves in once it goes off". This is a real game killer which makes the game lose a lot of tactical depth.\n\n- The above point also makes a few weapons (like said flashbangs) useless. You will be using frag grenades 99% of the time. Things like door wedges that were vital in a game like SWAT3 when used properly? You have these here, but the maps are so small and simple and the action so fast and so straightforward that you will never really have a need to use them.\nThe game has a lot of guns, but most of them are unbalanced or useless.\n\n- Short and repetitive. There are just 7 maps (Afghanistan, Turkey, China, Germany, Mexico, Russia, Colombia) and 5 missions in each, which gives 35 missions in total. It sounds like a lot, but it is not. Each mission takes just around 05.-3 minutes to beat. These are really very simple missions, forget about complex missions like SWAT3 had. There is also a bomb-difusal mode and a "evacuate your squad from the site" more, which sadly take place on the same mission maps as the regular mode.\nThe maps are also uninspired and feel bland, no real mission briefing worth mentioning. No memorable locations.  I think only the china map feels any novel and that's because it takes place on a freighter. The maps just feel laz and unfinished, though the graphics are often pretty ok for a tactical game.\n\n- AI is forgettable. I have not seen it do anything outlandishly stupid, but it is static, lazy and fails to ever surprise anyone.\n\n- No snake camera or anything of this sort. Most of the time you just need to go into a room and "spray&pray".\n\n- No CS gas. The game has an option to buy gasmasks for the squad, but its decorative only. Seems like a feature the devs decided to abandon.\n\n- No formations. No prone stances, no crouching etc.\n\n- No hostage rescue missions.\n\n- No arrests or wounds. Opfor will always fight to the death.\n\n- No secondary handguns for your team. You just have your main assault rifle and that's that.\n\n- While weapons have a rate of fire, they do not have a magazine size and there are no reloads. Very unrealistic and sloppy. Again, this just makes the game feel very rushed.\n\n- The cover system (while it has a very clear and good UI) is very hit and miss as far as gameplay goes. Example: I have a wall behind my back, nothing in front between me and my opponent, but the game treats me as being in hard cover because of that wall BEHIND my back.\n\n- There are several SF units to choose from, including spetsnaz. But sadly these do not have accurate gearfor the most part and spetsnaz comes with no Russian weapons whatsoever (despite AI opfor sometimes using russian weapons). So yeah, again feels sloppy and unfinished.\n\n- Breaching charges are very poorly implemented, you can only use them on the initial entry door at the start of the mission, not for doors withing the buildings. Same with lockpicks, just usable on main door. That is just absurd.\n\nPros:\n\n- I like the "plan moves than have a few seconds go in real time" mechanic. The game itself is played in turns. You plan your moves, then the actual action occurs which takes several seconds of real time. Then the action pauses, you can again plan moves, then the action real time segment continues etc.\nThis allows for tactics, while the actual turn being played in real time does depict the chaos and "split second" nature of close quarters combat.\n\n\n- The whole option of customizing your weapon right down to scopes, grips etc is fun, but again feels unfinished.","May 20, 2015","false","7.3"," 101 of 141 people (72%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","72","101","141","3","5"

Perhaps the closest analog to Breach & Clear would be Frozen Synapse's asynchronous turn-based tactical combat, with a dash of XCOM's classes and SOCOM's aesthetic.\n\nEach mission places you in control of a small squad (each country has a small perk, i.e. SEALS have faster reactions). Your team consists of different classes, each with special abilities. For example the medic can heal a soldier or heal himself, the Fireteam Leader can draw all enemy fire to him, the Weapons Sergent can lay down suppressing fire, Intelligence can jam doors. As you level up, your troops unlock new abilities. Your weapons are equally customizable, from optics to grips to gas systems. Limited use gear like flash bangs and snake cams provide more strategic options.\n\nGameplay wise, Breach and Clear is all about the tactics. Place waypoints, aim line of sights, move to cover, cover your angles. Since enemy placement is randomized, you can never rely on one tactic for each level, instead always playing smart and considering how best to approach a room without leaving a blind spot that could bite you in the ♥♥♥. Don't do that, don't plan well, and your men will die. Your missions will take you across the globe, from Afghanistan and Russia to China and Germany, from simply taking down enemies to defusing bombs and reaching extraction points. Each requires you to play a bit different. The tactics to breaching a room is different than setting up to defend an area while defusing an explosive or moving to the extraction area.\n\nWhile Frozen Synapse is certainly more complex, I actually prefer the realistic special ops aesthetic and the laser focus on close quarters combat and breaching compared to FS's sci-fi virtual style. And this isn't some crappy port either. The game runs silky smooth, the controls feel great, and the visuals have definitely gotten a nice upgrade. Setting up waypoints and firing angles feels even better with a mouse than touchscreen.\n\nVisually it's not Crysis or Battlefield, but neither was Frozen Synapse. And Breach & Clear makes up for its visuals with cool little touches such as your troopers realistically leaning around cover to fire\n\nI'd definitely recommend Breach & Clear if you enjoy tactical gameplay with a realistic edge.\n\nEdit: PC additions include new weapons and maps, improved visuals, a permadeath setting, and probably some other stuff I'm not aware of\n\nWill update the review once I've played more, tried out permadeath","March 21, 2014","true","1.2"," 117 of 175 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","117","175","0","1"

Well, now you can perform similar types of missions on a much smaller scale with a lot less meaning. All you need is Breach & Clear, which is a tactical strategy game along the lines of XCOM: Enemy Unknown, but with a focus on realism. You take command of US Navy Seals, US Army Rangers, Canada’s JFT2, and other highly trained military squads in global missions.\n\nBefore you even begin the game, there are a number of decisions for you to make, including which of the real-life elite military groups to purchase and play as (US Navy Seals, US Army Special Forces, US Army Rangers, Canada’s JTF2, etc.), what to name your squad members, what their physical attributes should be, and which class each should represent. The chosen classification will bestow the given individual with a related special ability, with more earned as each person levels up through experience. You can also outfit each soldier with unique weaponry, attachments, uniforms, helmets, and the like. Better  equipment can be unlocked and purchased as you progress through the campaign. There are several locations to play, but Afghanistan is the only one unlocked from the start, so you’ll begin there.\n\nYou are presented with a top-down/isometric viewpoint of a set of rooms wherein enemies are hiding out, invisible to your omniscient eye. Your goal, as the game’s title suggests, is to breach the location and clear it of all hostiles. Most maps have multiple breach points, so you can select where you want your soldiers to enter and how. Each round involves a planning phase and an action phase, much like Frozen Synapse or any of the Rainbow Six titles. For each soldier, you select where you want him to move to, as indicated by circles that appear upon an invisible gridded floor.\n\nAdditionally, you determine each soldier’s vision cone at each waypoint, of which you can have several in a single turn. This ability allows you to own every angle, as the saying goes. Buttons are available to allow each soldier to use his special ability, too, such as laying down suppressive fire, tossing grenades, and more. When you are satisfied with your plan, tap the Breach button to watch the action play out. Soldiers will engage enemies automatically when one is spotted or they are fired upon, allowing you to see the enemy location from that point forward.  Any soldier standing next to an object is considered to be in cover, with the protection aiding them in surviving a firefight.\n\nThe action phase lasts a few seconds before you are allowed to adjust your strategy in a new planning phase. The level ends when all members of one side have been killed. If you are successful, you can earn stars, experience, and money. Stars are used to unlock access to gear, weapons, consumables, etc. Experience offers you 5 points to add to each soldier’s stats at each new experience level, which can be used to boost health, accuracy, reaction, speed, etc. Money is used to purchase the items that you’ve unlocked.\n\nEach scenario can be played in multiple difficulty levels, with each offering stars to earn. You’ll want to replay each mission several times to nab the stars needed to unlock everything that you can. The gameplay is engaging and it gives you a lot of control over what happens and how you conduct your business. The focus on where to move, when to move, and where to train your focus are the essence of the game, and I applaud the devs for not trying to add too many options that could overwhelm the player.\n\nGraphically, the game looks terrific, with an impressive level of detail if you really drill down. The choice to use real military units and real weapons is commendable, as it offers a great sense of authenticity that’s lacking in similar titles. The sheer number of weapon/attachment/uniform combinations available for each soldier is dizzying. The environments have plenty of places to utilize cover and nooks in which to hide. Character animations and movements are great, and you’ll really need to act responsibly to escape unscathed. Switching between a top-down and isometric viewpoint is only a button away, and dragging to pan, twisting to rotate, and pinching to zoom ensure you’ll always have a great angle on the action.\n\nAll of these options and deep levels of gameplay are all well and good, but they happen to be in service of a game that quickly becomes repetitive. With the exception of the level designs, which are really well done, every level is played exactly the same. You choose your tactics, choose your positions, choose your path, hit the Breach button, and then watch the action unfold. There is very little variation to the gameplay, and after a while you might find yourself getting kind of bored. The lack of any kind of story to put anything in context here just adds to the problem. You have no idea as to why you’re doing any of this, who you’re fighting or even who your soldiers are.\n\nThe one thing the game does extremely well however is its marketplace. Here you will find a plethora of guns, lights, grips, IR devices, suppressors, and gas systems which you can buy and equip on your weapons. You can also buy various gear that you can outfit on your squad and some of the clothing will even give you a stat boost. If you are the kind of person that loves to collect items like this, then you will find reason to keep going back into missions to earn some more cash.\n\nBreach and Clear provides a strategic RPG-style look into the world of Special Operations that provides an unusual spin on both the Strategic RPG genre and the military gaming world. Breach and Clear is a solid title worth playing.","March 7","true","88.9"," 34 of 40 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","34","40","2","0"

Right off the bat the graphics, customization, and tutorial are beautifully remade and remastered. I have long awaited this to come to Steam a long time. This game is like a game of chess, you gotta play the right moves with the right pieces. The game allows a very elaborate armory with well over a 100 weapons, tools and armor to choose from. This game is an outstanding strategy game with lots of potential. I would recomend this to anyone who enjoys Arma and Jagged Alliance.

I dunno, shooter? Can you put this into the strategy category? Who knows, let's go with thing. So it's a tactical turn based isometric thing, yeah got a nice ring to it. Now when going into the game I have to tell you, unless you are as excited about the prospect of breaking doors and killing people as I was, which pretty much sums up the game by the way, you won't be impressed. Graphics are... dated, soundtrack-- well I would comment on it by I was listening to my own music while playing so I really don't remember, I am sure it was alright. The options menu also was lack luster, it sure wouldn't impress TB much. But enough from the technical side of things, honestly there is not much to say about it anyway as you might have noticed.\n\nIn B&C you start off by forming a squad, you can choose between one of 7 types of special forces from all around the world, and when I say all around the world I mean half of them are from the US/Canada. Anyway, you pick your special forces and create your teammates, each one of them can have different specialities like Breacher, Fireteam Leader etc. Note, that, depending on your type of Special Forces the stats of your soldiers will change.\n\nI have to say that when I started the game it was really fun, it felt quite cool to get your team through a mission, though I suppose that they weren't all too challenging in the first place. The game feels tactical, and as you progress through the missions the better your soldiers and your equipment gets, which allows for a different approach while breaching.\n\nBut here is where the problem of this game lies, it's easy as hell, at least on normal difficulty with perma death. Why? I hear you ask, well first off, perma death doesn't mean anything since you can quit the mission if your soldier died, and oh hello, here he is again. But more importantly, the progression system of B&C is flawed, the higher the level of a solder, the stronger he gets, makes sense right? Think again, since a single mid to high level soldier could probably clear out levels alone without too much trouble. Another criticism I have is that I didn't care much about the soldiers, when I played XCOM: Enemy Unknown and a soldier died, I was devastated, maybe if perma death would work I wouldn't have that issue, but as it stands I do. Not that this is game breaking but it was something I felt was missing.\n\nSo, what is my conclussion? Well, like I said, I don't know. This is a solid game that can be fun, however I think it got weaker as it went on especially since the two, secondary modes B&C has, Bomb Defusal and escape plan felt kinda boring compared to terrorist hunt(the "kill everyone" mode). Did I enjoy my time with Breach and Clear? Yeah, most of it at least. Is it a great tactical experience? Meh...\n\nTL;DR\nGraphics: Dated\nSound: Ok? No idea, wasn't listening.\nOptions Menu: That don't impressa me much.\nGameplay: Solid and simple gameplay, easy to graps. Good fun....\nFlaws: ....at first, then your soldiers get OP and it gets boring.\nNotes: Probably a good idea to turn down the volume a bit. Shots are loud.\nVerdict: Buy it on sale. Then you'll get your money's worth for sure.\nPrice: 14,99€\nDevs: Mighty Rabbit Studios ,	Gun.\nPublishers: Gambitious Digital Entertainment, Devolver Digital, Gambitious\n\nFOLLOW MEEEEH: https://twitter.com/AndGeoGames  @AndGeoGames","August 6, 2015","true","15.5"," 44 of 60 people (73%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","73","44","60","12","0"

The normal price of 15€, however, is way, way out there for a product like this. That's why the thumb down.\n\nThe female voice in the opening sequence is talking about how this is "the most advanced tactical simulator which revolutionised the world of urban combat and is used throughout the world for training puposes in various military forces" etc. Well that's just utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, like claiming Paranormal Activity is actually composed of real life footage. I would describe this piece of software as a "silly little game", rather than a tactical simulator, and if this is "most advanced" I really wouldn't want to see what the less advanced versions look like.\n\nBasically you have a team of four dudes (why is it always four? the SAS apparently assaulted the Iranian Embassy in London with some 30 soldiers, against six terrorists. The Russian military assaulted the Moscow theatre in 2002 with some 200 men if I remember correctly...), who you will use to clear rooms of enemies in scenarios which last about 2-15min of real time, and some 7-40 seconds of game time (talk about blitzkrieg! :D) There aren't any terribly complicated tactics or techniques involved, you can tell your men to walk from waypoint to waypoint, stay still, or throw a flashbang or a granade. Firing at enemies is automatic. You give commands to your men simultaneously while the game is paused, and then press OK and the gametime advances by some 5 seconds or so, during which you have no control over what happens. After the 5 secs it's another order-giving turn in pausemode, and so on. There is no command to wait for two seconds and go, which means that when you're about to assault a room you either throw in a flashbang first and wait until the next turn to go in, by which time the effect of the band has already worn away. Or, you can charge in right away with another soldier while another man is deploying the bang, which means that the guy assaulting the room has already dispatched all the baddies and maybe taken some damage himself by the time the flashbang goes off.\n\nCompleting the missions give you experience which improves your soldiers, and money which you can use to buy new gear and weapons. Some of the gear is strictly cosmetic, and has no impact on gameplay, such as sunglasses or uniforms in funny camos. For some reason one of the bulletproof vests is by far the best, with a +145 bonus to health (or something like that), while all the others have something like +20 bonus to health. And the superarmour is not even the most expensive one, and it has no drawbacks... :D and yeah, in the true videogame fashion, the soldiers have a simple numerical value of health, which means that it doesn't matter how much lead they eat during a mission, if they finish with at least 1 health left they are ok in the next mission. Incredibly advanced and realistic.\n\nSo yeah, all in all, it's a casual little tactics game, with hardly any real substance and very little flavour or immersion. Maybe the devs made the opening video first, and actually intended to make a realistic tactics simulator, but once they had the graphics somewhat ready they just thought "f*ck it, anyone fancy a pint? Just wrap it up and publish it on Steam." I'm glad I only paid that four Euros for it.","December 9, 2014","false","19.8"," 27 of 32 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","27","32","3","0"

Don't buy the DLC either, it sucks in every possible way, unless you like having green blobs and red blobs moving about a blue screen.\n\nThe gameplay is entertaining enough, you can set field of view and there is a bit of a tactical element but you can't prioratize targets, you can't tell your men to throw a grenade then move in after it goes off (leading to several instances where one man has thrown a grenade and the other instead of waiting then moving has charged in and blown himself up) and you can't use any form of snake camera to peak through doors.\n\nPurchasing weapons is stupid. first you complete missions in the fastest time possible to unlock the 4 star rating, then you need several thousand £££ to buy the gun and the accessories like scope, suppresor, light ect. with the most expensive accessory being superior to the others in every way leading you to wonder why they included the possiblity you'd buy one of the ♥♥♥♥♥ier ones.\n\nThe stats for the guns vary wildly, with the FN P90 being far far less accurate than a shotgun which is more accurate than the first few assault rifles you unlock and the TAR21 being as accurate as a sniper rifle.\n\nThe AI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and comes in one variety, so long as you set your field of view to point at them, even on the hardest difficulty, you will win relativley easily.\n\nThe levels begin to all feel the same and use the same level design for all three modes of play. this is only broken up by the fact a harder difficulty means more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ enemies and enemy placement is slighlty random (you play the same level more than oce and you know there will be 2 enemies in that room somewhere but are they stood near the coffee table or that bookcase 4ft away) There are enough levels that this isn't a problem though.\n\nThe tips that appear during loading screens sometimes seem to refer to elements of the game that don't even exist, stating their is a ranger training mode that all teams can participate in when thier isn't. When it doesn't gives these tips it provides out of date or incorrect "facts" about the military groups you  can play as.\n\nAnd to top it all off this game is no longer being developed so all these problems will remain, have fun getting used to them.\n","December 10, 2014","false","15.3"," 48 of 68 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","48","68","0","0"

The game has more in common with call of duty scenarios than real life counter terrorism operations. Soldiers acquire perks and weapons are only effective a fraction of the range of their real life counter parts. It would also be hard to argue that the soldier classes bear much in common with real life soldier roles instead displaying strange attributes like the intelligence specialist's ability to disappear.\nThe combat itself is fast paced and interesting. It doesn't often feel cheap except when your squad isn't leveled enough to tackle a map. There aren't any game breaking flaws in the combat system  which is more than most tactical level turn based combat games can boost. The game offers incentives to use fire and movement realistically and the ability to flank and suppress means the player has to keep their team on the move. Perma death thankfully can be enabled which gives a lot more weight to the player's decisions. The game uses a WEGO system for the turns but you'll hardly notice because the AI doesn't move around much.\nEnemy classes don't offer huge variation but they do provide enough to allow the designers to create some interesting tactical puzzles. Heavily armoured soldiers can cause your team serious trouble if they can close with them and snipers obviously operate at the other end of the spectrum.\nThe graphics are quite nice with your soldiers displaying the weapons and gear you issued them with. Everything is clear and easy to interpret except some more obvious fog of war would be nice so players would be provided with some idea of which areas had been cleared. The spotting system is balls, soldiers can see through walls and some items completely negate the fog of war completely. This game certainly could have taken a few lessons from the original Xcom in that department.\nThe level design is often pretty good but the game's original platform holds it back. Maps are too small and quite clearly were designed with short playtimes in mind. They get better as the game goes on but it feels a bit strange that multi story buildings are absent and the game's attempts to emulate this by making assaults on large buildings take up multiple missions doesn't really feel convincing. The game modes provided are Terrorist hunt, bomb diffusal and escape which are all pretty much self explanatory. They all change up the maps slightly but in the long term aren't enough to keep things from going stale. Bomb diffusal maps feature the ever annoying enemy reinforcement spawns that are the bane of several srpgs but within the context of this game they work extremely well and give the mode a bit more tension.\nThe game tries to keep the player's interest by offering what seems at first to be extensive customization options, but realistically half the weapons and gear offered aren't ever really going to come in useful. The outfitting screen could also do with some work as no indication is given how prospective weapon and gear purchases differ from what is already equipped(unless you click back through some menus). Unequipping all the modifications off a weapon can be quite tedious as well.\nBesides tactical combat, the game doesn't offer much else and what's there feels somewhat lacking. The potential of the system is never fully explored because the maps never really get that big and the squad size stays at four men. Insertion methods never change with rappling and helicopter assaults never making an appearance. This lack of variation results in the game getting a bit stale after a while.\nIt can feel a bit half ♥♥♥♥♥ at times too with some design choices(no ability to use smoke is the most glaring one)leading to the player's units taking unavoidable damage in some situations.\nThat said fire and movement in the title generally works well and dumb tactics are often punished. The market isn't exactly swimming in squad level turn based strategy games so this is a welcome addition.","June 3, 2014","true","18.6"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

Including you and the bad guys\nThat's not a bad thing, however. In fact, it's a pretty neat concept, although not entirely new.  It's always nice to see some varitey in the genre, and only few games handle their turns the way B&C does.\n\nHoewever, where B&C doesn't manage to hit the spot is the challenge.\n\nIn B&C most missions are either too easy or too hard.\nIf a mission is too easy, you simply ignore all the little intricacies the game has to offer, so for example you rarely if ever set waypoints or plan your men's field of view. Instead, you just charge in, gunning down every enemy on the way.\nIf a mission is too hard, this is often the game's fault, when the random generator for example places one of your men right in a room with four foes nearby, leaving him no chance for survival.\n\nI still had fun with the game, but overall I can't recommend it wholeheartedly.

I found this game really suits me for cuople of reasons.\n\nOne is that it's not overly complicated. You can easily learn and master the controls and fundamental gameplay in minutes after the tutorial. Each missions are not too long, just enough for my rather short concentration. Now, that does not mean this game is shallow. It will give you quite a bit of options you can take, as well as tactical challenges you will need to work around.\n\nSecond is the Stats/Gear system. You can build your own squad with operators with different class, stats, and gear. Since there are 6 classes and only 4 operators can be in a single squad, you will need to adjust your strategy depending on what kind of operator is available.\n\nThe third is the overall "tacticoolness". If you are firearms/military enthusiast, you will probably appeciriate this game. Most of gears and wepons dipicted in game is realistic, as well as appropriate. Authentic weapons and tactical gears from manufacturers such as Surefire, LaRue, First Spear, LBT, etc... are availble at your operators disposal and you can kit up your team of real-life global warfighters, ranging from 75th Ranger Reg., German KSK, Canadian JTF2, Russian Spetznaz, and everyones favorite, SEAL/DEVGRU. You can outfit Army SOF with BALCS and DCU, give the seals JPC and Airframe helmets. Sadly there are not too many variations at the moment. I hope the devs add more choice of weapons and gears.\n\nSome ways, this game really reminds me of Medal of Honor: Warfighter. Gameplay aside, you can feel that the creators of both gmaes defnitely put a lot of effort into military authenticity. However, the gameplay is enjoyable, but ordinally and really not outstanding.\n\nOverall, I reccomend this game to anyone looking for casual tactical game and like guns and operators operating operationally.","January 12, 2015","true","8.5"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

Getting sub 15 second clear times on multiple room levels is one of the fuzziest feelings I've gotten playing a turn based game and the game does a good job of trying to teach you the idea of efficiency of movement.\n\nIf you, like me, grew up playing the OLD Rainbow Six games, then this will feel very familiar, as you plan out the movements of your team every turn and then they rush to execute that plan. Play with Permadeath on, it adds an element of stress in the later levels when there's some very hard to handle corner and hall combinations that the enemy will easily take advantage of even on the easier AI settings. Great game, 9/10.","November 15, 2014","true","7.1"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"

It features a plausible game mechanics, dated but nice  graphics; the missions are fast-paced and action-loaded. However, as with many games that try to avoid micro-management, the developers seemed to forget at times that the game is intended to be played by a human being. There is a ton of interface constraints which I cannot help but call stupid, like being able to throw grenades only at the beginning of the turn, excluding any movement for that soldier, or being unable to command soldiers to wait for a specific number of seconds to ensure simultaneous action. Another issue is balance. To name just one example, the UAV is like a legit cheat which shows all position and movements of all enemies throughout the mission, even inside buildings, which renders the recon class absolutely pointless.\n\nBut the most glaring disadvantage is the lack of tactical possibilities. I mean, in a tactical strategy, where are the smoke grenades? Where are those nifty hi-tech gadgets like motion scanners? They would be a lot more fun to use than the aforementioned UAV. The scarcity of the tools offered to the player quickly makes the missions monotonous - Breach & Clear, Rinse & Repeat - making the game suitable to kill off half an hour from time to time, but not more.\n\nThese are all correctable flaws, and it's a pity that the developers released Breach & Clear too quickly, without testing not only stability but also playability. The should have invested more effort into their product.","April 24, 2014","false","4.3"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","14","20","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/266130/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","I walked into Breach & Clear hoping for some serious copy of former SWAT series. What I got was a sort of XCOM copy. Although the games tactics may appeal to you, some of the lack of attention to minor details may upset you. I got this game on extreme sale and would recommend you do too.\n\nPlain and simple, this game is no where near the level of what SWAT 3 or 4 was. Still to this day, there hasn't been a SWAT game that has managed to immerse the player as much as those two have. Breach & Clear is a top-down turn based swat action game where your main objective every time is still simply wipe every enemy out on the map. It's fun at first, but the lack of diverse objectives make the game redundant. At the very least, opponents do move about the map when you initiate contact. Meaning, if they are not taken out and you do not having any squad member watching your back, they may sneak up on you. Upon starting a level, the player can scope out what entrances are available and can tell each officer where to start. The game play itself is not bad. You are in control of four units in which you can tell them where to move and how to move. Choosing movement paths was decently done.\n\nSay for instance you would like to go down an open hallway as it can be a little tricky sending one unit at a time to deal with the danger. The system in place lets you choose multiple points on where the unit should go (so broken paths) and additionally, let's you choose which way to face. This latter fact is important in providing the appropriate cover for your units. If your unit is caught off guard due to not looking the right direction, there is a good chance he'll be shot and may go down. The movement itself can be modified as a unit can be told to walk slower to increase his accuracy and allow other units to catch up or overtake. Grenades and flash bangs are available to use upon purchase. Yes you heard me right, this police force has to replenish it's supplies after every run. Every time you use it, you're going to have to replace it if you want to use it again.\n\nThere are some units that are able to throw and continue their movement while some units spend their turn throwing the ordinance. This dependence is directly related to the classes you choose. For instance, a fire team leader has the ability to draw fire, a weapons sergeant can use his suppress fire ability to possibly save a comrade in trouble, a breacher can throw a grenade and continue to move along his path instead of ending his turn, a medic (I'll leave this one up to your imagination) and a direct action soldier can go in quietly. Depending on how you want to go in, it's really up to you to choose what's the best combination. I use a fire team leader, a medic and two breachers just because I like making noise. Each individual can upgrade (level wise) as you progress. You can upgrade stats such as accuracy or speed to improve your character. As well, their weapons can be modified with special sights or with fore grips. What drives me extremely mental in the game is the fact there is a pause after every turn to tell you it's the next phase. I believe that could have been done by being a lot more subtle.\n\nThe graphics themselves are okay. Their nothing extremely over the top or triple A, but simply okay. The player can maneuver the camera but it can never go exactly where you want it (or if your an explorer don't count on looking around too in-depth). What is nice is that sometimes the camera will go over the shoulder when shooting down suspects or going through a door. The sounds are okay as well. Gun shots sound more or less similar while there is no real dialogue going on.\n\nHonestly, it's an alright game if it's on sale. I'm not recommending it because truth be told, I'd rather play XCOM or UFO when I start playing this. I also don't like the fact it's turn based and how the equipment scheme was set up.\n\n\nRATING : 6.95/10\n\n\nScreenShots\nBe ready to see this after every move\n\nWhat a few downed enemies look like\n\nMultiple room breach with two separate teams at two different locations\n\nCamera shifting angles\n\nCan you see where my units are exposed\n\nMultiple arrows showing my breach tactic\n\nCamera will often go to this angle when initial breach occurs","January 31","false","2.1"," 19 of 31 people (61%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","61","19","31","3","0"

Just........Awesome. If you like tactical military sims, this is a great purchase. A friend gifted me this as a birthday present, but I would probably have purchased it in any event. This game is defintely worth the 17 CDN, if you like turn based tactical games from the third person perspective. Games that are similar to this are Frozen Synapse, and XCom Enemy Unknown. Weapons are upgradeable, tactical gear and equiptment to make your soldiers more efficient on the battlefield are also upgradeable. Enemies toughness and difficulty scale nicely through the difficulty levels. Different nationalities garner different bonuses.

The graphics are a port from a mobile game so the visuals do leave a little to be desired, and the stop and start gameplay can get a little annoying after a while. I would have liked to see the ability to view the whole mission from start to finish as a replay that you could save and upload to YouTube (or similar site) later. I also think that with the introduction of a level editor or multiplayer component of some kind, but hey that’s just me. But the biggest issue with the game is actually its price currently the mobile version of Breach & Clear is listed at $4.99 while the Steam version is listed at $14.99, currently it is on sale for $9.99.\n\nThe games publisher has defended this price difference by noting that everything is included in this version of the game out of the box unlike its mobile counterpart, some fans are still finding this hard to swallow but if you haven't played Breach & Clear yet and don't like to game on mobile devices than it is worth playing especially while its still receiving a discounted rate.\n\nMy Full Review is available at QJ.Net [www.qj.net]","March 23, 2014","true","18.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I was a little concern about how well it would "upgrade" to the PC. I was concerned it would just be a rehash, but to my delight it is not. Full support for resoultions and proper mouse and keyboard controls.\n\nA very unique and tactical minded game, highly recommended. Build your squad, load your weapons and gear, and start the missions. As you complete missions you gain stars to unlock more missions and more game modes. Your squad also levels up, allowing you to distrubute points in different areas. And a nice replay feature after each mission.\n\nTIP: You gain stars for finishing missions, the better the score the more stars, stars are used to unlock more missions and modes. Don't be afraid to start at Easy level or Normal level, that will give you more stars because you can replay each mission at each level for a full set of stars.\n\nGet this game if you love tactical planning and excution.

That's the short version.\n\nThe long version is that this game does well to cover a market that really isn't thriving right now. For so long strategy games have been more about commanding large armies rather than smaller squad levels of highly specialized soldiers. The few that do attempt this are either outdated or poorly executed. Breach and Clear provides a breath of fresh air to a genre that seemed stuck for a long time.\n\nI will admit, the gameplay is rather simpe and somewhat repetitive, but still will suit true strategy/military genre fans out there. You are allowed to control 4 man squads of some of the world's best specialized combatants (American Special Forces, Army Rangers, Navy SEALs; German KSK; British S.A.S.; Russian Spetsnaz; Canadian JTF2). In this squad creation of whatever force you decided to pick(you cannot mix and match, if you pick Rangers, all four members of that squad are Rangers, but you can create multiple squads), you create four operators each with default skills and loadouts(the loadout is by default the M4A1 SOPMOD, the skills vary somewhat based on what kind of force you pick. Special Forces, for example, will have higher health stats by default). Upon creating a squad, each member of the team you create must be assigned a role, and depending on this role he will have special abilities and skills(the fireteam leader provides bonuses to his squad as well as being able to draw enemy fire, for example). As you complete missions, your soldiers will  earn experience, thus allowing them to upgrade certain stats, such as health, movement speed, accuracy, etc. Also, with each successful mission, you earn moeny to buy new gear and weapons for your operators(only qualm I have about the guns is that they are almost all American used weapons, most of which AR-15 derivatives, so there's not a whole lot of variation there).\n\nWhen you start a mission, you are given an aerial view of the area of operation(this is the main viewpoint for te entire game). This will allow you to examine the area before sending your guys in. Once content with what you see, you can select which entry points you want your guys to stack up on(most maps will have at least two entry points, though there are several that have just one). You can divide your team to tackle multiple entries and cover more ground, or you can keep your units together and lessen the risk of one of them going down. When you send the guys in, you have a movement stage, where you coordinate where you want your guys to go, what direction they cover, what actions they should do, etc. Once you got all that figured out, you can execute, and your guys will follow your orders to the best of their ability. Be mindful, when you activate this and they start moving, the enemy starts moving to, and will therefore react to your guys, this is where turn based strategy meshes with real time strategy. Assuming that your team is well equiped and your tactics are sound, you should be able to complete the missions without many casualties.\n\nSo the gameplay, unfortunately, doesn't vary much. The same principle is applied over and over. But the gameplay is solid and once again those who enjoy this kind of commanding style will be pleased. Overall, I'd give it a solid B rating. Could be more varied in terms of gameplay mechanics, but what it does offer is well rounded and well executed.","January 17, 2015","true","53.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's a strategic doorkicking strategy game with enough content featuring 3 modes currently (Terrorist Hunt, Bomb Defusal, and Hostage Rescue/Escape).  You control 4 operatives from the Rangers, SEALs, SpecOps, Speznaz or other such organizations through each area in a series of phases where you issue commands.  The "special" element to this game is it's perspective concept and "owning every corner" by controlling the direction that your guys are looking as they enter and clear each room.  The shooting on it's own is fully automated if the soldiers are looking in the right direction but it does allow you to aim thrown grenades and medkits only work on nearby allies.  The enemies will react to noise and often charge out of rooms so covering doorways is still a concern (or you can use an intelligence soldier to wedge the door)\n\nCertain weapons get unlocked in the store as you achieve a certain number of stars but any completionist out there might want to revist the stages to aim for the 2100 stars achievement.  I found a certain amount of "violence of action" was required to 4 star the missions later on.\n\nThe problems with this game lies in it's somewhat hollow customization options when it comes to the marketplace options as outfitting each unit feels more like equipping Stat-sticks rather than anything new an improved (especially when it comes to gear).  The consumables make the game much easier if you're willing to grind out a few of the previous levels to pick up a few defibilators (completely negating permanent death) and UAVs but for hardcore fans/gamers they might choose to avoid those completely to artificially amp the challenge.  The level up perks and stat increase from grinding experience makes the game a snap for anyone playing on harder difficulties but struggling with a particular stage.\n\nThe other issue is that the gameplay itself feels tedious as you continue on through it's somewhat repetitive missions of pointing your guys at enemies and watching them do their thing.  The context for the missions is very thinly described on a mission brief but not integrated into the game very well (as you have to escape to the main menu between each mission in order to even read this excerpt).  I found very little keeping me attached to the story or my unit itself without some personal imagination on the "terrorists" we're hunting.\n\nI'll still recommend the title for being a foray into something different but it's not without it's own set of issues.","December 20, 2015","true","13.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

You choose a preset face for each team member, from about 20 preset faces, and then you select their role in the unit; team leader, breacher, intelligence, medic, etc. Each unit gives a special stat bonus (the Spetsnaz give two bonuses), and each role has unique skills that benefit the team, such as the ability to throw a grenade and move in the same turn, to revive allies, or to draw the fire of all nearby enemies so your teammates can move safely. The customization continues as you level up your characters, allowing you to upgrade their skills as you would in a regular RPG, increasing their hit points, accuracy, etc., as you see fit. The final touches on your team comes in the form of gear, such as helmets, that can add health to the wearer, various vests that differ in weight (which affects movement speed) and health bonus, weapons (the game includes a large arsenal of automatic rifles, shotguns, submachineguns, etc. to fit any role.. and oh yea, you can customize those too), and finally cosmetic stuff such as face paint and the clothing that your operator wears. Hell, just playing around with the customization in this game can be very impressive, but naturally the fun doesn't really start until you starting breaching doors.\n\nBreach & Clear scenarios are divided into the standard kill scenario, where you must breach a location and kill all of the targets, a bomb defusal scenario, where you must breach the location, find the bomb(s) and then protect the bomb while it is being diffused, and then an escape and evade scenario where your team is already in the thick of it, and you need to help them fight their way out of there. All three modes are available right off the bat, with higher difficulties unlocking as you receive stars for completing missions quickly, and with minimal casualties.\n\nIn order to accomplish each mission successfully, you must effectively utilize your moves/turns, which are commands that decide the actions of your teammates in 5 second intervals, and the general goal of each turn is to do as much damage to the enemy as you can, while taking as little damage in return. Naturally, you can choose to run and gun willy-nilly on lower difficulties, but higher difficulties, and the later missions, require effective teamwork within your unit, utilizing tactics such as covering fire, taking advantage of flash bangs and grenades, and properly clearing rooms in a way that covers all of the corners. In the end, what you have is the satisfaction of planning out the perfect raid, followed by the even more satisfying task of watching the assault play out, and then finally basking in your own excellence as you successfully clear an entire compound of terrorists in under a minute, without getting so much as a splinter from the door you just blew up to take out the first three terrorists you came across.\n\nSure, the game is repetitive, you don't think actual Special Operators grow tired of clearing the same kill house for the 1,000th time? The break in the monotony comes when you change tactics, when enemies decide to spawn in new places (yea, enemies change spawn locations), or when you decide to change the kit for your team. Want to go all-out stealth, with no armor and silence weapons? Go ahead. Want to go loud, with heavy armor, helmets, shotguns and machine guns? Feel free. So really, the monotony only comes from a lack in creativity. There are tons of ways to go about tackling every single mission in this game, just remember; slow is smooth, and smooth is fast.\n\nRight now, I give this game a solid 9/10, but I would certainly love to see some stuff added to the game to make it even more awesome.\n\nHopes for future updates:\nMore military units to choose from (MoH: Warfighter definitely got this right)\nA wider range of weapons beyond just rifles and a couple of submachineguns, shotguns and a sniper rifle.\nMore breach options, please. No bang and clear? Prybar? Having a class that can breach through a wall would be awesome as well (Again, Warfighter covered these very well)\nHostage/VIP rescue missions (grab and extract, or escort)\nStealth missions","June 7, 2014","true","19.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

At one hour into it so far, this game has become one of my top ten favorite strategy games for several reasons. Not only does it have a huge bevy of missions to choose from, it has a large section of gameplay devoted to customization as well as (optional, sadly) PERMADEATH - my favorite aspect in any "hardcore" game.\n\nThe gameplay is easy to learn; I was able to figure out how to play in roughly 15 minutes. The problem comes with tactics - in true to life fashion, what can go wrong WILL go wrong, and the came is fairly unforgiving. On the base difficulty and the first mission, I still lost a squadmate after he got shot in the face for getting a little too hasty, which, ironically, is what cemented this game as a favorite of mine.\n\nIf you like games that challenge you, like strategy, or enjoy blowing things up, I heavily recommend Breach and Clear as an excellent choice - especially during the Steam Summer Sale, while it's half off.","June 28, 2014","true","3.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The tutorial covers the game mechanics very well, although the gameplay is a bit lacking in depth if you are used to more hardcore tactics games.\n\nAs you plot waypoints for your 4 squad members, you can click on any gridpoint in their routes and switch where they are facing, effectively allowing you to cover maximum area and actually "check corners" as you move. The action points come in the form of your "speed" rating for each character, as seconds are passing throughout the stage. The game captures the intensity of what I would imagine a real "breach and clear" situation would be like pretty well. If your "turn" is over and bullets are still flying, the game will enter slow-motion and you will even see characters in the process of falling to the ground if they've died.\n\nThe character level progression is pretty fast, and you can repeat/grind levels fairly easily.\n\nThe length of the game is decent, there are 3 game modes (terrorist hunt/bomb defusal/escape) for each location, and each location consists of several stages.\n\nThe customization in terms of gear is not too expansive, but still very nice. You will unlock weapons as you beat stages and earn "star" rating points (up to 4 per level), but all the other equipment is available to purchase immediately.\n\nSomething I like to do over and over is click the "replay" button after I've planned out and executed my moves for the round, watching from different viewpoints.\n\nAesthetics are nice, nothing too fancy. Using cover is easy as the shield feedback will immediately tell you what level of cover your character will have. The "undo" button allows you to cancel any waypoints/actions you may have planned out.\n\nOverall, the game is very fun if you are into this type of gameplay. Price-wise, I don't think you would miss out on too much if you wait for it to go on sale, however, I think it is worth the current price.","July 3, 2014","true","3.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hippyshake/recommended/266130/","hippyshake","Hippyshake","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hippyshake/","1352 products in account","Breach and Clear is a turn-based strategy game in which you control four members of a squad of your own design. While there is no over-arching story, the game offers plenty of scenarios and challenges to overcome.\n\nPros:\nThere's quite a bit of content: three types of gameplay ("Terrorist Hunt," "Bomb Defusal," and "Escape Plan") across 35 settings (in seven campaign scenarios). That's 105 levels in the core game.  On top of that, there's a lot of replay value here, especially if you care about earning achievements, acquiring different gear, or improving your mission rating.\n\nI've read that this is an import from iOS and Android. In no way does B&C feel like it;  it feels as if it was designed from the start for the PC. This, of course, is a very good thing.\n\nMany details, whether aesthetic (such as first-person perspective views using the first four number keys), or mechanical (such as the ability to drag and move paths that have already been placed) are welcome.\n\nOffers seven different, specialized squads to play, as well as dozens of weapons that open up as you progress.  Also offers several personnel types (Medic, Intelligence, Weapons Sergeant, et al), each with their own perks and preferences.\n\nThoughtful (and occasionally complex) level design, coupled with a clever mix of random and strategic mob placement, offer serious challenges and extend the playability of the game. I spent nearly two hours, failed attempt after failed attempt, trying to take out Gus Fring's a cartel's meth drug lab; when I finally succeeded, it felt good.\n\nThere is the option of Permadeath (yay!), and even a "Memorial" area where you can view your fallen heroes. Nice touch.\nCons:\nThe tutorial is so bare-bones that the game has an unfair reputation for being shallow, when it's simply that players are never taught correctly about the deeper features and functions available to them.\n\nThe number of stars  (the game's rating system, from one to four stars) you get is, for the most part, entirely time-based. That is to say, losing team members obviously makes your rating go down, but it will also drop to a one star rating if you go past a certain time limit, no matter how well you did on the actual mission (even if everyone survives with health intact). This seems, to me, to be a bit unfair. Give me two stars at least for completing it with everyone alive.\n\nIn the last campaign of the "Terrorist Hunt" mode (in Columbia), my soldiers simply refused to open doors, often walking right up to them but not bothering to swing it open (maybe they were busy setting up the Livestream). In any case, changing the rules this late in the game wasted valuable turns staring at the door's presumable lovely wood grain instead of killing whoever stood behind it (although this was inconsistent, even on the same map...some doors they'd open, others they wouldn't, so this was more likely a glitch than a design decision).\n\nEnemy AI can be wonky. If mobs are facing the opposite direction, they may not even notice you. I had my whole squad throw open a door and walk past an apparently deaf cartel member only two tiles away. Also, Snipers can often see through walls and high obstacles, but this mainly just affects corners.\n\nThere is no real story to speak of. That's fine, but it would have been nice to have some kind of feeling of accomplishment at the finish line. "A winner is you," or "Conglaturation!" Anything would have been nice, particularly because some campaigns promise a big finish and never follow through. For example, in the Columbian campaign, you are told you're chasing a major drug lord throughout his compound; the game leads you to believe there will be a massive shootout on the roof, complete with a helicopter waiting to take him away, only when you get there - no drug lord, no helicopter.\n\nIn "Bomb Defusal" mode, terrorists can suddenly appear behind you, coming through the door you've just breached! What the heck is that?\n\nYou can't sell an item you already own unless you have enough money to buy another one. Makes no sense to me either, but apparently it does to one of the developers, so there it is.\n\nA few of the 64 Steam-specific achievements are just plain broken, and support is, from the forums on Steam and the developer's own website, most likely not coming.\nThe Bottom Line:\nIt may sound like I'm complaining, but I'm really only nitpicking. This is a solid effort that provides a lot of hours of fun. There's nothing here that a patch couldn't fix (not that I'm expecting one; it seems as if the devs have long since given up on supporting this). It's just that Breach and Clear is so close to being a really special, great game that it feels like a bit of a shame that the developers didn't feel the need to take better care of it after the birthing process. As it stands, though, B&C is a very, very good game, but one which requires some time, online research, and experimentation to truly see its depth.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tamren/recommended/266130/","tamren","[GWJ] Tamren","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tamren/","216 products in account","I saw this game featured on the Autumn sale and seemed like a decent game for the 5$ asking price.\n\nThe best way to describe the gameplay is a mix of Frozen Synapse Lite and XCOM. Units move along a path you designate and face in specific directions, engaging any enemy they see. Unlike Frozen Synapse your units can take cover behind objects and units in cover are much more durable as in XCOM. There is a major emphasis on flanking and use of grenades to flush out enemies. The game offers three game modes based around the same set of maps. The first one is straight up Seek and Destroy where you move through a level and clear it of enemies. The second involves getting to and defusing explosives. And in the third mode your units start in the middle of the level and must fight their way clear.\n\nThe game is not without issues and lacks polish in many areas. The game's mobile origins are very clear in the setup of the interface and the level-based progression system. One point in it's favour is a detailed options menu for controlling sound and game resolution. Something which many games lack, especially mobile ports.\n\nWhen you first start the game up it immediately forces you to create a team of soldiers. First by picking the unit they come from (Navy Seals, JTF2 etc) and a class for each character of the 4-man team. However since you haven't even done the tutorial yet you will have no idea what stats do and what classes mix well together. Annoyingly each class has a set of perks you can't even see until you make a squad and examine a soldier's stat page.\n\nEvery soldier starts with a set of basic equipment matched roughly to what they would use in real life. You can upgrade each soldier by unlocking and then purchasing new equipment. Progression is linear in that later more expensive equipment is better in every way. Weapons can also be upgraded with components such as a new trigger or gas system to modify the statistics. However these upgrades can easily produce weapons that break the game or weapons that deal no damage at all. In all honesty whatever assault rifle your men start with is perfectly adequate and most of the specialist weapons like the light machine gun or shotgun are useless.\n\nSoldiers can also wear various clothing and body armour, but this is another area where the lack of polish shows. Hats can clip through hair and beards. No matter what they are equipped with your soldiers have a tan coloured pistol belt that probably won't match the other things they wear.\n\nThe third mission type is extremely silly. The premise of having your men escape the level is good, but the implementation is terrible. Your men start scattered around the level with each man in a mexican standoff with 1-3 gunmen standing not 10 feet away. 90% of the time all you have to do to win the level is to hit the end turn button, watch your men gun down everything and then spend a couple turns moving them to the exit. Personally I just pretend this part of the game doesn't exist and stick to the first two mission types.\n\n--\n\nAll in all I would recommend this game for sale price only. There is fun to be had, but don't get into it expecting Rainbow Six. The developers are working on a new game called Breach and Clear: DEADLINE which promises to be an improved version of the game built with the PC in mind instead of the mobile platform. Sales of this game can only help them in that endeavor.","December 2, 2014","true","2.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlyingShisno/recommended/266130/","FlyingShisno","Flying Shisno","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlyingShisno/","769 products in account","This is a great Squad Tactics, turn based strategy. When you load up a game, it'll ask you to make a Squad. First you choose what kind of Special Forces you want your dudes to be: US Navy Seals, Germany's KSK, Canada’s JTF2, UK's SAS, and if you get the DLC, you can play as the Green Frozen Synapse guys too. After that, you choose each one of your 4 guys portrait/face, which is pretty limited, and their class, such as weapon expert, medic, direct assault, etc., which governs what kind of skills you can use in game and what kind of passives they have. You can name your squad too.\n\nOnce you're in the game, you have your squad move through the level eliminating terrorists. If you've ever played Frozen Synapse, moving around and killing is like that, but less in-depth. Click where you want to move, and where you want him to face when he get's there. You can click along his path and have him look in a different direction when he get's there. You can also have them throw grenades and other equipment if you've purchased them(more on this in a bit). You do this with all 4 squad members, click 'breach', which starts the turn, and they'll all do their orders immediately, shooting at enemies that enter their line of site. A 'turn' is pretty much 5 seconds, and clicking Breach will have them carry out orders and shoot people for 5 seconds before time stops and you can issue another set of orders Some have skills and passives, like the Weapons Expert has 'Suppressive Fire', which does what it says. The Intelligence class can see all around them, a 360° range of vision for a fairly short distance, about 5 feet. Normally, a soldier has  the standard 40°-45° cone line of sight in front of them(no distance restrictions), simulating a person's eyesight. The Intelligence class has this stanard 45° cone, plus a much smaller 360° view, which extends maybe 10-ish feet. This is great for when an enemy is in a place you didn't expect. Normally a soldier will turn around by himself and shoot back at an enemy that shot him, but that's a precious few seconds of getting wailed on. The 360° view let's the Intelligence class immediately start to turn around the second he enters his range. You'll still get hit since you'll still have to turn around, but the chance of dying has been drastically lowered.\n\nAfter each mission you get money, experience, and a 1-4 Star rating depending on how well you did,  Experience will level up a soldier, and when he levels, you can put 5 points into one of their stats. Each class has some stats all on their own, like the Intelligence Class has a stat that increases his 360° view distance. All Classes have some similar stats though, like all have a 'Moving Speed(distance you can travel in one turn). 'Accuracy', 'Health', and 'Reaction', which is how long it takes for them to 'lock on' to the enemy and start shooting. All stats can be increased to 100, and each stat starts at around 45-55. The type of squad, such as US Seals/German KSK/UK SAS/etc, plays in here too. Each type has a beginning bonus to one of their stats. I believe either the US Rangers or Seals starts with their Accuracy at 75. Each squad type has a bonus, and that bonus can pretty much aid in your preferred play style.\n\nAs for money, You get a $200-ish bonus for completing a mission for the first time, and I think $200 per Star(rating), at least on normal difficulty(4 modes). There are other bonuses and penalties that reward/subtract too. Anyway, in the main menu there's a Marketplace, where you can buy new clothes, armor, helmets, weapons, all sorts of weapon attachments, and consumable items. Most of these items will offer some sort stat boost, like scopes increasing accuracy and armor(vests) increasing health. This isn't Door Kickers btw, where buying the gun once unlocks it for free use with everyone else. If you want your 4 squad members to wield that shiny rifle, then you'll need to buy that shiny rifle 4 times. I wasn't  mocking Door Kickers btw. I love that game too. If you're short on cash, and there's a particular level you like, you can simply do that level a few times to earn money. Just keep in mind that you'll only really earn money for the amount of stars you get on that run(4 max). So at most, on normal difficulty at least, you can only get $800 max, and you'll probably have some of that subtracted due to taking damage or taking too long. The prices are not ridiculous btw. They're not expensive, but you won't be buying everything in the first hour(or week).\n\nThere are a good number of missions to do, and lots of gear and weapons to get and play around with. I definitely recommend this game.","December 7, 2014","true","5.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rr10nov/recommended/266130/","rr10nov","rr10nov","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rr10nov/","99 products in account","N.B. my recommendation for this game depends entirely on the the fact that I picked it up for 4$. If I had paid full price for this game, I would probably feel a little more lukewarm about this. Now that that's out of the way...\n\nThis game really shines in its mechanics. There is a strong incentive to be careful, plan ahead, and make the right choices in terms of tactics and equipment. Moreover, there are multiple paths to success, and the variety of maps makes it difficult to confine yourself to a single strategy.\n\nAs compared to other turn-based tactical games (I'm thinking X-Com: EU in particular), the action plays out in a very satisfying way. Simultaneous movement of your troops and enemies adds a lot of realism to the game. The ability to choose firing angles along your path, rather than picking targets with hit percentages, really gives you the sense that you're in control, not the RNG. The cover system is excellent, with flanking angles being the default rather than an option. Stealth is a viable option with suppressors and a welcome addition to the game.\n\nUnfortunately, this game does have some issues. Most glaring, and something that puts a bit of a damper on the strength of the gameplay, is that the AI is very bad at adapting to you. I've often seen the AI deliberately take a flanked position en lieu of something which offered full protection. Higher difficulties do not seem to increase intelligence but buff enemies. Alert states seem a bit off, since enemies only really react to seeing you, instead of, say, being alerted when the person in front of them is dropped by a gun with a silencer on it.\n\nThe most glaring flaw of this game is customization and the menu system. For a game whose selling point is massive customization, the system feels far more shallow once you actually delve into it. There are clear winners in attachments and upgrades, so you end up sticking to those when you can afford them. The menu system for upgrades is by far the worst feature of this game. Having to unequip each upgrade and then confirm the unequip so that you can switch weapons and put those upgrades back on is clunky and slow. Doing it once is bad, doing it for each of your four soldiers (and then back again after a mission) is torturous. In addition, the cosmetic features of your soldiers reduce to face gear and camo patterns. X-Com may not have the depth of this game's tactical play, but I felt way more invested in my individual troops in that game.\n\nAesthetically speaking, the game isn't much to look at. The graphics are sloppy, but since you're spending so much time zoomed out, it hardly matters. What you see conveys what you need to know, and that's fine. Less fine are the sounds. I get that they're sticking to realism, but none of the sound FX seem to have the necessary 'weight', if that makes sense.\n\nTL;DR if this game is on sale and you need a quick fix for realistic tactical combat, this is a game for you. It's loads of fun for a little while and outshines its contemporaries in its mechanics. There are some areas that seriously require polishing, but if you can overlook those, you'll have a ball.","December 4, 2014","true","7.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

First you choose what kind of Special Forces you want your dudes to be: US Navy Seals, Germany's KSK, Canada’s JTF2, UK's SAS, and if you get the DLC, you can play as the Green Frozen Synapse guys too. After that, you choose each one of your 4 guys portrait/face, which is pretty limited, and their class, such as weapon expert, medic, direct assault, etc., which governs what kind of skills you can use in game and what kind of passives they have. You can name your squad too.\n\nOnce you're in the game, you have your squad move through the level eliminating terrorists. If you've ever played Frozen Synapse, moving around and killing is like that, but less in-depth. Click where you want to move, and where you want him to face when he get's there. You can click along his path and have him look in a different direction when he get's there. You can also have them throw grenades and other equipment if you've purchased them(more on this in a bit). You do this with all 4 squad members, click 'breach', which starts the turn, and they'll all do their orders immediately, shooting at enemies that enter their line of site. A 'turn' is pretty much 5 seconds, and clicking Breach will have them carry out orders and shoot people for 5 seconds before time stops and you can issue another set of orders Some have skills and passives, like the Weapons Expert has 'Suppressive Fire', which does what it says. The Intelligence class can see all around them, a 360° range of vision for a fairly short distance, about 5 feet. Normally, a soldier has  the standard 40°-45° cone line of sight in front of them(no distance restrictions), simulating a person's eyesight. The Intelligence class has this stanard 45° cone, plus a much smaller 360° view, which extends maybe 10-ish feet. This is great for when an enemy is in a place you didn't expect. Normally a soldier will turn around by himself and shoot back at an enemy that shot him, but that's a precious few seconds of getting wailed on. The 360° view let's the Intelligence class immediately start to turn around the second he enters his range. You'll still get hit since you'll still have to turn around, but the chance of dying has been drastically lowered.\n\nAfter each mission you get money, experience, and a 1-4 Star rating depending on how well you did,  Experience will level up a soldier, and when he levels, you can put 5 points into one of their stats. Each class has some stats all on their own, like the Intelligence Class has a stat that increases his 360° view distance. All Classes have some similar stats though, like all have a 'Moving Speed(distance you can travel in one turn). 'Accuracy', 'Health', and 'Reaction', which is how long it takes for them to 'lock on' to the enemy and start shooting. All stats can be increased to 100, and each stat starts at around 45-55. The type of squad, such as US Seals/German KSK/UK SAS/etc, plays in here too. Each type has a beginning bonus to one of their stats. I believe either the US Rangers or Seals starts with their Accuracy at 75. Each squad type has a bonus, and that bonus can pretty much aid in your preferred play style.\n\nAs for money, You get a $200-ish bonus for completing a mission for the first time, and I think $200 per Star(rating), at least on normal difficulty(4 modes). There are other bonuses and penalties that reward/subtract too. Anyway, in the main menu there's a Marketplace, where you can buy new clothes, armor, helmets, weapons, all sorts of weapon attachments, and consumable items. Most of these items will offer some sort stat boost, like scopes increasing accuracy and armor(vests) increasing health. This isn't Door Kickers btw, where buying the gun once unlocks it for free use with everyone else. If you want your 4 squad members to wield that shiny rifle, then you'll need to buy that shiny rifle 4 times. I wasn't  mocking Door Kickers btw. I love that game too. If you're short on cash, and there's a particular level you like, you can simply do that level a few times to earn money. Just keep in mind that you'll only really earn money for the amount of stars you get on that run(4 max). So at most, on normal difficulty at least, you can only get $800 max, and you'll probably have some of that subtracted due to taking damage or taking too long. The prices are not ridiculous btw. They're not expensive, but you won't be buying everything in the first hour(or week).\n\nThere are a good number of missions to do, and lots of gear and weapons to get and play around with. I definitely recommend this game.","December 7, 2014","true","5.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rr10nov/recommended/266130/","rr10nov","rr10nov","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rr10nov/","99 products in account","N.B. my recommendation for this game depends entirely on the the fact that I picked it up for 4$. If I had paid full price for this game, I would probably feel a little more lukewarm about this. Now that that's out of the way...\n\nThis game really shines in its mechanics. There is a strong incentive to be careful, plan ahead, and make the right choices in terms of tactics and equipment. Moreover, there are multiple paths to success, and the variety of maps makes it difficult to confine yourself to a single strategy.\n\nAs compared to other turn-based tactical games (I'm thinking X-Com: EU in particular), the action plays out in a very satisfying way. Simultaneous movement of your troops and enemies adds a lot of realism to the game. The ability to choose firing angles along your path, rather than picking targets with hit percentages, really gives you the sense that you're in control, not the RNG. The cover system is excellent, with flanking angles being the default rather than an option. Stealth is a viable option with suppressors and a welcome addition to the game.\n\nUnfortunately, this game does have some issues. Most glaring, and something that puts a bit of a damper on the strength of the gameplay, is that the AI is very bad at adapting to you. I've often seen the AI deliberately take a flanked position en lieu of something which offered full protection. Higher difficulties do not seem to increase intelligence but buff enemies. Alert states seem a bit off, since enemies only really react to seeing you, instead of, say, being alerted when the person in front of them is dropped by a gun with a silencer on it.\n\nThe most glaring flaw of this game is customization and the menu system. For a game whose selling point is massive customization, the system feels far more shallow once you actually delve into it. There are clear winners in attachments and upgrades, so you end up sticking to those when you can afford them. The menu system for upgrades is by far the worst feature of this game. Having to unequip each upgrade and then confirm the unequip so that you can switch weapons and put those upgrades back on is clunky and slow. Doing it once is bad, doing it for each of your four soldiers (and then back again after a mission) is torturous. In addition, the cosmetic features of your soldiers reduce to face gear and camo patterns. X-Com may not have the depth of this game's tactical play, but I felt way more invested in my individual troops in that game.\n\nAesthetically speaking, the game isn't much to look at. The graphics are sloppy, but since you're spending so much time zoomed out, it hardly matters. What you see conveys what you need to know, and that's fine. Less fine are the sounds. I get that they're sticking to realism, but none of the sound FX seem to have the necessary 'weight', if that makes sense.\n\nTL;DR if this game is on sale and you need a quick fix for realistic tactical combat, this is a game for you. It's loads of fun for a little while and outshines its contemporaries in its mechanics. There are some areas that seriously require polishing, but if you can overlook those, you'll have a ball.","December 4, 2014","true","7.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

First of all, this game is HIGHLY addictive, be warned.\nBut, there's some major problems with this game I've found personally.\nAfter levelling up my whole squad to 35+ and unlocking most of the guns..the game lost my save files and causes me to start from square 1 with a whole new squad.\nI don't know if that is a common problem with other people, but this has happened 3 times to me. The first two I was only just into the game so was only slightly annoying, but when I lose 10+ hours of gameplay, it is infuriating.\n\nSecondly, many achievements do not unlock first time. Eg. achievement to finish a map under 5 seconds. It took me 8 attempts till it finally registered that I completed the achievement.\n\nTl;dr - I would recommend to get the game. You will get addicted to it. You WILL get very annoyed.

I got this thinking it would be fun to play the Spetznaz, but as far as i can tell there is literally no reason to pick anyone but the American special forces because they all speak in American accented english, and the only thing worse to me than a baddly accented cast is one that isn't even accented at all. Hell, they could have plugged voice lines in to google translate and had the voice actors say their lines in broken Russian and German for all i care, i wouldn't have noticed and it would have made me happy to know they at least made them speak the right langauge.\n\nNow that all the hate is out of the way, for what irked me it was a simple and somewhat fun game for the twenty minutes i gave it. I wish it was fleshed out more, maybe an economy or base building, but since its not i can't really say its worth the $14 i paid for it. If your going ot port an iOS game to the PC, you have to not only change it to fit the controls, but to also fit the price your asking for, if it was a better version of the iOS game and not just the same than maybe, but since its the same they should have priced it like it is, as a fun little I-pad game you play now and then, not like a full game your meant to play for more than a few weeks just a few weeks before going "Nope, not playing this again" and deleting it from your computer because its not worth the hard drive space to keep it on there","July 22, 2014","false","0.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I will update my review if they update their game. The attachments for the weapons are really unbalanced there is one vest you can buy that give your men something like +175 health while the others for the same price will give them +5-10. I don't know if you had to pay for this vest in the phone version or what? Plus many more weird things. When I select a different trigger the picture doesn't show it on the gun. Silencers lower damage come on in Call of Duty that makes sense but this is a simulator. Many weird things with the attachments.\n\nWeapons are weird as well. You can only buy two weapons at the beginning and even after unlocking a third the gun your guys start with is better... So I'm not sure wny they would give you an option to buy a new crappier one?\n\nTool tips would be nice. There are 6 classes but you can see the differences while lining them up at the door. It would be nice if you could tell this. There are a lot of places more tooltips would come in handy.\n\nIf you your walk up to a door they open it. I wish there was a way for them to sit next to it without opening it. Not a huge deal you just after to remember this when telling them where to go.\n\nThey also need to put a restart put in the game. If you lose a couple guys you have to either finish the map, kill your other guys, or get out of the game to restart. As soon as your are done with the map you can restart so its not like they don't let you replay the maps.\n\nOverall this is a fun game. But I think if I could go back in time I would have waited to see if they patch it first.","March 23, 2014","false","6.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Yes with upper cases because that's what gives an 8 year old playing COD wetdreams. One word defines my whole experience on that : "disappointment". To explain it better the customizations options for clothing and apparel is giving a decent choice but : the plate carriers and chest rigs all look the same and the arsenal  comes straight from your average US armory. Why is it a problem ? Well, because the armory is an AR-15 based orgy (seriously, you got more than 20 variation on the M4/M16) and a couple things more "original" live a 1st version TAR-21 and SCARs seen thousands of time before... where are the real guns like, I don't know, Aks, HK416/417, FAMAS, G3 or even the base gun all KSK use : the G36K (and I found that many people think only the C exist)... I have more variaty in my own armory.\nAlso : where the hell are the side arms ?\n\nAlso one might think given the realistish approach the gun stats may have reflected their actual use in real life, but in fact is a linear progression where the next gun is better only by virtue of being unlocked later.\n\nGraphics and animation are less than appealing but as stated in many other reviews the game was mainly built for mobiles devices but given the price tag on this game I seriously cannot excuse the lack of work put in textures that seemed to have just been stretched and ludicrous animation (special mention for the pathetic door kicking at initial rounds).\nThis is not acceptable at all for a 15$ game !\n\nIn the end I had some hopes for this game but fact is this game does not just fail to deliver, it is simply a money grabbing operation on TBS amateurs such as myself and all the Kikoolols thinking they could become SAS by snapping their fingers (thanks Modern Warfare...).\nTo sum it up : you want a real TBS game, just type X-COM in the search bar and save yourself.","April 28, 2014","false","2.7"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","1"

There will not be multiple objectives in one mission.\n\nPros:\n\nHigh Customisation. in guns you can attach lights, IR systems, sights, different triggers, and gas systems and muzzle attachments, note that you can't customize all of them on all guns.

Several out there will tell you otherwise because of a few reasons.  Some complain about the graphics being dated, well I am an old school gamer from the Atari 2600 days so lemme say that great graphics do NOT make great gameplay.  I'd rather have a blocky ugly game that plays great than some photo-realistic crap that simply isn't fun just pretty to look at.  Another group of players will say there's no varity in weapons, equipment, etc.  Folks being a former active duty U.S. Marine I can tell ya that in the real world you don't always get "varity"  you get what your issued and make it work.  You improvise, overcome and adapt.  Those are the two biggest complaints I see from some reviews, most of these only have one sentence and in no way justify their complaint on the game in any way.  There is plenty of weapons and equipment and as you unlock harder difficulties you'll fond plenty of challenge and replayability.  There's no one way to beat each scenario, you can try different approaches each time and see which works best.  Graphically the game is just fine and reminds me of the models used in the original Rainbow Six, whuch was way better  than its better looking sequels.  Plus this is available for iOS now so you can play on the go.  I think multiplayer is the only thing I'd add or improve in the game at all.  I highly recommend this title to any fans of urban combat, close quarters simulation.

Does not come close to its competitor Frozen Synapse, but delivers what  promises in parts, getting impossible not to compare each one.\n\nDespite having a description on page extremely tempting, promising a highly tactical and complex game, is hardly so.\n\nStrategies and options are simple, basically limiting the positioning of soldiers and their handling in each phase. You simply enter the room and see the shooting happen. You can break down doors, throw tactical devices like grenades and flashbangs, and choose which way to look. Nothing else. The game is an infinite looping entering the room, get lucky for the soldiers first shoot the enemies and start all over again.\n\nA typical game for mobile phones that was poorly ported to PC. It is very clear looking at the layouts and menus of the game, very badly adapted.\n\nSome soldiers have certain specific skills for each class, such as locking doors and having improved reaction time but also by the structure of the game such skills make little difference in the time of action.\n\nThe graphics are typically mobile. Few animations make the game boring (like terrorists falling in the same position) and the sound effects are amateurs.\n\nDespite being a mobile game badly ported to PC it's a little amusing. There are options to purchase equipment and a wide customization possibilities. Probably as the game grow with their development (giving more respect to the pc's users) it can become better.\n\nBriefly comparing the competitor, are almost two different games. The complexity and tactical strategy are much deeper in Frozen Synapse.\n\nI'm not recommending the game, I suggest you wait more to spend your hard earned money and go for Frozen Synapse.\n\nGive a score 06/10 with a certain twinge of conscience.\n\nI hope you enjoy my review, any questions just ask in my profile.","June 25, 2014","false","1.0"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

Many of the expected tactical options are either missing or only unlocked at higher levels, and it often comes down to either hiding and sniping behind cover or advancing straight at the enemy. The first few maps have an intenseness that is needed, but as you progress to bigger, more open maps, it becomes a chore to clear out the area and there is little in the way of breaching.","June 23, 2014","false","4.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Does not come close to its competitor Frozen Synapse, but delivers what  promises in parts, getting impossible not to compare each one.\n\nDespite having a description on page extremely tempting, promising a highly tactical and complex game, is hardly so.\n\nStrategies and options are simple, basically limiting the positioning of soldiers and their handling in each phase. You simply enter the room and see the shooting happen. You can break down doors, throw tactical devices like grenades and flashbangs, and choose which way to look. Nothing else. The game is an infinite looping entering the room, get lucky for the soldiers first shoot the enemies and start all over again.\n\nA typical game for mobile phones that was poorly ported to PC. It is very clear looking at the layouts and menus of the game, very badly adapted.\n\nSome soldiers have certain specific skills for each class, such as locking doors and having improved reaction time but also by the structure of the game such skills make little difference in the time of action.\n\nThe graphics are typically mobile. Few animations make the game boring (like terrorists falling in the same position) and the sound effects are amateurs.\n\nDespite being a mobile game badly ported to PC it's a little amusing. There are options to purchase equipment and a wide customization possibilities. Probably as the game grow with their development (giving more respect to the pc's users) it can become better.\n\nBriefly comparing the competitor, are almost two different games. The complexity and tactical strategy are much deeper in Frozen Synapse.\n\nI'm not recommending the game, I suggest you wait more to spend your hard earned money and go for Frozen Synapse.\n\nGive a score 06/10 with a certain twinge of conscience.\n\nI hope you enjoy my review, any questions just ask in my profile.","June 25, 2014","false","1.0"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

Several out there will tell you otherwise because of a few reasons.  Some complain about the graphics being dated, well I am an old school gamer from the Atari 2600 days so lemme say that great graphics do NOT make great gameplay.  I'd rather have a blocky ugly game that plays great than some photo-realistic crap that simply isn't fun just pretty to look at.  Another group of players will say there's no varity in weapons, equipment, etc.  Folks being a former active duty U.S. Marine I can tell ya that in the real world you don't always get "varity"  you get what your issued and make it work.  You improvise, overcome and adapt.  Those are the two biggest complaints I see from some reviews, most of these only have one sentence and in no way justify their complaint on the game in any way.  There is plenty of weapons and equipment and as you unlock harder difficulties you'll fond plenty of challenge and replayability.  There's no one way to beat each scenario, you can try different approaches each time and see which works best.  Graphically the game is just fine and reminds me of the models used in the original Rainbow Six, whuch was way better  than its better looking sequels.  Plus this is available for iOS now so you can play on the go.  I think multiplayer is the only thing I'd add or improve in the game at all.  I highly recommend this title to any fans of urban combat, close quarters simulation.  One of the best, period.","September 8, 2015","true","0.2"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Graphics aren't great, it looks pretty brutal (for modern gaming standards) in my opinion. Similar games like Doorkickers use minimal artstyles and graphics but they definitely looked and felt a whole lot better/polished than Breach & Clear; Breach & Clear seems to try to look good, but doesn't really pull it off.\n\nWorse of all, I found myself bored within the first few minutes of opening the game. That doesn't necessarily mean that all of it will be, but I definitely don't feel invested the same way I was with Doorkickers.\n\nI bought this game because of the positve reviews and because I LOVED Doorkickers. This definitely is in the same exact vein, but so far hasn't excited me. I'm not going to count it out yet, but first impressions aren't great so far.\n\nI guess the gist of my review could be as follows:\n\nIf you're interested in this game but haven't played Doorkickers, go buy/play Doorkickers.\nIf you're still interested in this game and own/have played Doorkickers, you're likely better off to go back to playing Doorkickers...\n\n","May 5","false","0.2"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","45","5","11","2","0"

It's tons of fun and very well polished for a mobile port. Most things in this game are done right, but there are a few huge flaws about that keep it from greatness. First off, there's no multiplayer mode... Really!? A turn-based strategy has no multiplayer gamemode!? Secondly, the camera controls are a bit wonky. You'll get accustomed to it, but it just feels off. Finally, there isn't a story. You're just dropped into singleplayer missions. There are 3 game modes and about about 95 missions in all, which will give you about 15 hours of game time, but they dont have much replayability, so once you play them, then they're done... I got it in the humble bundle and I can say it was easily worth that price. If you enjoy games like XCOM: Enemy Unknown, Frozen Synapse, or Jagged Alliance, then you have no excuse to not buy this game.\n\nSo, lets review.\nPros:\n+Great addicting gameplay\n+Large amount  of character and squad customization\n+Decent visuals for a mobile port\n+Good AI (on Hard and up)\n+Large amount of missions\n\nCons:\n-No story\n-Wonky controls\n-No multiplayer (Seriously?!)\n-Missions can get repetitive\n-Is a mobile port\n\nOverall, I give this game a 7/10.","July 15, 2014","true","11.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Sure, it's fun going through the missions and leveling up your team in their respective specializations and getting them new gear - but then what?\n\nIt's completely satisfying watching your team burst through a door and open up a can of whoopass on some unsuspecting misfits.\n\nOne of my main complaints about the gameplay, which may be a bit strange, but here it is:  You can see almost everything.  The only thing I have to wonder about is where the enemies are standing and which direction they are facing.  Surely things could be more interesting if I had a kind of blueprint of the building, and some not-so-trustworthy intel about what objects and obstacles may be where.  There's no peeking through windows or tiny spy cameras to get a better idea of what's on the other side of a door - it's all just there and you know where everything is.\n\nI like the game, but I also want there to be more variables.  I know my team can breach and clear a room in seconds and shoot at anything that isn't themselves.

Decent customization even though the weapon and gear models look too similar. The weapons are balanced and there are several nice levels which can be enjoyed in 3 modes: Terrorist hunt (kill everybody), Bomb Defusal, survival/escape.\n\nGraphics are decent but not eye-popping. Far from it, actually. The human models all look pretty much the same even if you select different characters. Mediocre at best and could have used a more vivid style and color palette.\n\nThe gameplay itself is turn based tactical battles. about 70% of the maps are indoors and use tight corridors and covers to keep the action pumping and the rest are outdoors which focus more on tactical play and choosing the best ways to strike.\n\nYour squad of 4 (which you can create yourself and customize) level up as you gain more stars in missions and more XP. You also receive money to purchase new weapon upgrades and gear. You choose specifically which attribute to level up for each soldier (e.g. accuracy, speed, special ability, reaction etc.). This all helps to give the game longevity as well as harder difficulty settings which make the game much more demanding. I'd also like to note that the music is pretty cool.\n\nI only wish there was a "Restart Level" button in the pause menu because you need to go back to the main menu every time you choose to restart a level mid play.\n\nAll in all, a great bargain game and I'd say it's worth the full price even though there aren't many maps to play around in (there are new ones in a DLC though). But if you liked Frozen Synapse or want to give the games a try I think you'll like what you find here.","October 14, 2014","true","8.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

And especially tactical simulators.\nMy first run was near 2 hours.\nI enjoyed this game and played the first mission, 5 times.\nThis game has very much to offer in terms of difficulties,missions,equippments,replayability,roles and ofcourse the main reason we purchae this game - tactics.\n\nGameplay:\nGameplay is very simple once you get used to it (I got used to it very fast and the tutorial was short and clear).\nYou have 4 characters, each one has same options and your role is to control them.\nBesides that, there is the map itself which has easy acess to it (all you need to do is to move the cameras to your like, and manovering the soldiers on the map.)\nMe as a hardcore tactical fan player I like to complete each mission on the best side so it took me around 15-20 minutes to complete a mission but after you do the same mission few times you do it faster and easier, and while still enjoying the mission. (8/10)\nCons: 1) Repetetive. 2) Full Members each mission (Annoying thing is you can only use all 4 members and not 2 or 1 or 3.)\n\nGameplay Styles:\n1) Go loud and use breaching equippment / Loud weapons / Frag grenades etc\n2) Go quiet and use silencers / lock picks / Flashbangs etc\n3) Split your team through the rooms or work with all of them togather in each room.\n4) Enjoy your time in investing and planning each mission to your liking and your own tactical strategy.\n5) Difficulties - 5 Difficulties. (8.5/10)\n\nGraphics:\nOnly saw one map so far but each room looks realistic with objects and tactical props (Walls/Big Closets etc that can block the A.I view so you can take cover behind them). (5/10)\nCons: 1) Lack of FPS.

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198122248263/recommended/266130/","76561198122248263","I AM THE LIQUOR","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198122248263/","273 products in account","This game IS fun, but it is plagued by many problems.\n\nFirst and foremost, in my 20+ hours I've found so many glitches, little things that aren't necessarily game-ruining, but are VERY annoying; especially if you're a perfectionist like me (I HAVE to get 4 stars on every mission). An example being my medic unable to "stabilize" downed teammates. That isn't game-breaking, but it gets on my nerves. Sometimes I find my team shooting in the wrong direction. For instance, if I send them to an area looking a certain way, and they happen to pass up an enemy, sometimes my guys would just shoot in a random direction, then turn back towards the enemy and shoot, then back forward. I'm not sure what the point of leveling up "reaction" when your team doesn't even react to certain enemies. There is no real-time changing of position or anything like that, the game plays in turns. This isn't bad, it can just be annoying considering the enemy can run/advance MUCH faster than any of your guys (unless you level up speed to 100). Another thing I noticed is once in a while one of my guys, despite me having set a path for him, does not move at all that turn.\n\nAs other reviewers have stated, this game feels unfinished. It really bugs me when developers let known glitches (like the medic 'stabilize' glitch) persist within a game and then work on a DLC. I know that the medic glitch is known because I saw a Facebook post for the app version of the game with comments from the devs to a guy who had brought it up. This game could be AMAZING if more things had been added. I feel like "Doorkickers" nailed it with the real-time movement and the fact that you can switch tactics on the fly instead of being stuck with whatever plan you chose.\n\nAs for the positive, the game has a lot of customization features, which I love. It almost feels like an RPG. You can name each member of your squad, choose their profile pic/appearance, then buy and customize ALL of their gear. It's really neat. I also love the star system (you get rated on your performance on a mission by stars--1-4 stars). It makes the game kind of addicting, and adds replay value. The mission locations are unique and on each game mode, you must change your tactics. The game modes are: Terrorist Hunt (basically just sweep a level until you've killed all the terrorists), Bomb Defusal (defuse a bomb within the time limit), and a mode where you escape the map out of an extraction zone (your men are placed in random parts of the map).\n\nThe game is by no means easy (on higher difficulty levels at least). Sometimes my fully-leveled squad struggled to clear certain levels, which I like. Challenges are good and as stated before, add replay value. The main reason I dislike this game is because it has many unfixed glitches/bugs, and it just feels unfinished.\n\nFinal Verdict: 6.5/10\n\nBuy this game on sale and you won't regret it. Don't pay $15 for an app.","May 29, 2015","false","23.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

This is a tactical strategy game that has you take command of a 4-person team that "breaches and clears" small areas. You command each unit individually, controlling things like their exact movement patterns, which way they will face, equipment to use, and so on. Has a huge amount of superficial depth, meaning that there is a ton of stuff to the game that doesn't really seem to impact it all that much, like unit stats. My unit with the worst reaction time, worst accuracy, and using the weakest gun would regularly clear out rooms of 2-4 enemies effortlessly, while my unit specially designed to kill enemies would fail to kill a single enemy out in the open. Despite this, it's definitely worth picking up and playing around with if deeply discounted.","May 13, 2015","true","4.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

And especially tactical simulators.\nMy first run was near 2 hours.\nI enjoyed this game and played the first mission, 5 times.\nThis game has very much to offer in terms of difficulties,missions,equippments,replayability,roles and ofcourse the main reason we purchae this game - tactics.\n\nGameplay:\nGameplay is very simple once you get used to it (I got used to it very fast and the tutorial was short and clear).\nYou have 4 characters, each one has same options and your role is to control them.\nBesides that, there is the map itself which has easy acess to it (all you need to do is to move the cameras to your like, and manovering the soldiers on the map.)\nMe as a hardcore tactical fan player I like to complete each mission on the best side so it took me around 15-20 minutes to complete a mission but after you do the same mission few times you do it faster and easier, and while still enjoying the mission. (8/10)\nCons: 1) Repetetive. 2) Full Members each mission (Annoying thing is you can only use all 4 members and not 2 or 1 or 3.)\n\nGameplay Styles:\n1) Go loud and use breaching equippment / Loud weapons / Frag grenades etc\n2) Go quiet and use silencers / lock picks / Flashbangs etc\n3) Split your team through the rooms or work with all of them togather in each room.\n4) Enjoy your time in investing and planning each mission to your liking and your own tactical strategy.\n5) Difficulties - 5 Difficulties. (8.5/10)\n\nGraphics:\nOnly saw one map so far but each room looks realistic with objects and tactical props (Walls/Big Closets etc that can block the A.I view so you can take cover behind them). (5/10)\nCons: 1) Lack of FPS. I get this is a sim game but they did add fps moments but I'm not feeling it cuz it's only in start/end of the mission. it would be better if we could switch between FPS and Map-Look modes of the cameras but oh well I guess it will take the tactical-strategy element of this game.\n\nEquippment:\nWhat can I say about this one..\n4 Sections - Weapons , Gear , Headset , Consumeables.\nThere is an in-game store (Buy/Sell items from the money you've earned in each mission).\nIn each section there are many things to buy include Vests/Guns/Gun Parts/Suit Colours/Camos/Grenades etc..\nSome of them are locked, you need to unlock them as you progress through the game.\nThere are also stats like Speed/Accuracy/Noise etc in some of the equippments. (7/10)\nCons: A bit more organized menu would be better, and there are some items I don't think I will use.\n\nRPG Elements:\nI should talk about this one cuz there are 6-7 special op teams you can choose from.\n6 Roles to choose from and stick them to your soldier.

But, instead of taking place in the future, it takes place in the present day, with real life missions, guns, and Spec Ops Units. In short, where as games like Xcom and Arma:Tactics are very stratgy based, I found this game to be based on "instinct". Missions took me a matter of a minute compared to an hour. I didn't think about what I was doing, I just was. And I ended up murdering everything with my squad of Zero Punctuation, Black Booker DeWitt, Chuck Norris and Duke Nukem. For $10, it is, well, worth it.\n\nI guess ill do a quick pros and cons, for the sake of putting this out there on launch day. When I spend more time with this, i'll attempt to have a good review.\n\nPROS\n+Fast Paced Combat. Like I said, its a welcome brake to be able to spend a few minutes in a game instead of an hour\n+Easy to learn. You can pick this up, spend about 10 minutes with it, and truley get it. Some may take that as a minus, but I see it as a very large plus\n+Amazing soundtrack, much better than CoD ghosts, and thats a $60 game.\n+Deep Costimzation. You can pick out your troops guns, hats, attachments, and more\n+Replayability. I feel like i'll be playing this for a long time due to all the different possibiltys in pathtaking\n+Varied maps. From Russia to Mexico, the missions felt different. More than I can say about most games.\n+Decent Port. In two hours, i got one gamebreaking bug. On hour one. GG\n+Fun. It seems like endless fun to go all Real Life and say "Contact Down"!!!\n\nCons\n-Bad UI in menus. Seems to be better suited to the tapping of a tablet than clicking of a mouse\nNo real other gripes exept a few things that didnt make it from the IoS version.\n\nI'd give it a solid 9/10.

Too much infact that I kept thinking this is in Early Access.\n\nIt's your average turn-based combat game but it feels quite bare compared to something like Frozen Synapse. I was expecting to be able to fully control waypoints and time everything so that the squad performs a lot more efficient, but at the moment as far as I'm aware I can only set where the soldier goes and which way he looks and that kind of feels repetitive and not very tacticool. "Deep tactical strategy simulation" doesn't feel very depthful or simulating at all at the moment.\n\nThe game does bring me back to titles like Police Quest: SWAT 2 and it is just as fun to play, but I just really wish they'd make the gameplay a little more intricate. Also there are about 7 regiments of special forces but you can only have 4 squads which is kind of disheartening.\n\nIt's not only the gameplay I wish they'd improve, the game still has quite a few bugs. The Skullcap which is a piece of headgear doesn't fit many of the soldiers and needs some adjustment which makes it unusable unless you're used to half the soldier's head poking out of it. The Ballcap and the Skull Mask don't fit together and also during a Shotgun breach if your soldier is equipped with the LMG he pretty much shoots himself in the face.\n\nIt has bugs and like I said it's missing a lot of potential. But it is massively addictive. I only recommend this game just by an inch.","September 26, 2014","true","26.9"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nubbarus/recommended/266130/","nubbarus","Nubbarus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nubbarus/","123 products in account","Shallow and greatly unpractical gameplay. The PC version of this game looks like it was made for tablets. Coordinating your squad members' actions proved to be quite difficult and limited. Here are some features of the game:\nYour tactical options for each soldier in a turn are:\n-Moving the soldier (you can set multiple waypoints and also choose between moving quickly or carefully);\n-Choosing on each waypoint where the soldier will be looking at;\n-Telling the soldier to hold his position;\n-Using the soldiers' special ability;\n-Checking intel on the enemy.\n\nSo far, your options are quite limited, but that is not inherently bad. Sometimes, a small array of options may be backed up by a great gaming experience. Now that's this game's undoing.\n\nThe AI is almost as smart as real person... if said person was blindfolded and told to find a way out of a maze made of death lasers that made noise so they could still be avoided... and even so the person decided to run and hug death.\n\nCoordinating your team's actions proved to be quite the challenge when you can't even tell one of your soldiers to take another soldier's position; you can't tell them to hold fire or to focus one specific enemy; if you tell a soldier move up to a door, he will immediatelly open it! Now THAT'S some real tactical decision right there, phew.\n\nDid you make a mistake while placing one of your waypoints? No problem! You just need to press the undo button and remove every subsequent waypoint you had set untill you delete the single one that was wrong... and now place them all again! (I guess the game does that so you don't lose track of what you had in mind...)\n\nEvery time you select a unit, your camera moves up to them, which is simply annoying. You then have to keep moving your camera all over the place because it seems like the game wants you to have full awareness of your team.\n\n"Juarez? You selected Juarez? Here he is, look! Look closer! See? That's Juarez! Want him to move over there? Okay! Lawrence too? Good! But let us just take a look at him! Oh my, how well positioned he is right here! Now go move your camera back!"\n\nThis game is quite good for on-the-go casual gaming, but definitely NOT for someone who's looking for some real squad-tactics game. The tactics you employ to win this game are basically, in order of priority: 1-Put soldier behind cover; 2- If enemy is still alive, throw grenade; 3-Win game.\n\nThe soundtrack is good, it fits in nicely.\n\nThe graphics are fine, nothing to complain about.\n\nThe camera movement is "meh". In addition to what's been already mentioned above, sometimes the action camera is badly positioned and you can't really see what's going on, but that's not gamebreaking.\n\nThe real problem is charging US$15 for a game that seems poorly optimised for PC and with little replay value. Frozen Synapse costs roughly less than two times this price but brings you four times more entertainment.\n\nLuckily I got this through Humble Bundle though, phew!","June 8, 2014","false","1.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

I always would have liked a mechanic or atleast a way to link my android scores and content. The graphhics and frames are vastly improved compared to on my phone.

Hopefully releasing onto PC means that you'll be supporting mods and adding more content for PC users. That said, as glad as I am that I bought it, it looks like it'll dry out pretty quick in the current state. Even starting with small things like expanding the marketplace content would go a long way. There aren't that many guns, and once you unlock all the weapons there's not much motivation to keep playing missions for the mission credits to buy things for your squads. As well, things like Multiplayer, a Level/Mission Editor and custom Campaign planner, Workshop Support, to name a few things, would all be very welcome additions. And probably necessary ones, before too long.\n\nOtherwise, this is a solid foundation from which to work. Definitely worth the $10.00 I spent on the sale price, though I wouldn't recommend paying the full tab for it. Not -yet-, anyway.\n\nAlso, just on the side, please fix the CADPAT pattern.

But when they are done right (because most arent) they are great fun. Its a genre that requires special attention to many details. Breach and Clear does all of those details right...even in the weapons and gear customization sections; an entire section that I was happily pleased to find, use, and have it actually matter in the game.\n\nThis was obtained for $6 on sale but I wouldnt be mad if I had paid full price. In conjunction with B&C I also purchased "Recruits", a aesthetically similar but substantially different game. I only mention that because I thought I was going to like Recruits much more than this.

В игре много интересных карт и снаряжения. Радует то, что игры такого формата стали наконец-то распространяться. Я думаю игра будет пользоваться большей популярностью на территории России, если введут оружие российского производства такие как, легендарный АК-47, современный АК-12, АЕК-971 и так далее. Хочу отметить, что наряду с прекрасной возможностью устанавливать на оружие различное тактическое оборудование в данной игре к сожалению отсутствует оружия  формата PG или PDR и дополнительный режим "Освобождения заложников". Надеюсь, что это даст дополнительный стимул замечательным разработчикам игры для введения новых образцов оружия и режимов в игру.

But when they are done right (because most arent) they are great fun. Its a genre that requires special attention to many details. Breach and Clear does all of those details right...even in the weapons and gear customization sections; an entire section that I was happily pleased to find, use, and have it actually matter in the game.\n\nThis was obtained for $6 on sale but I wouldnt be mad if I had paid full price. In conjunction with B&C I also purchased "Recruits", a aesthetically similar but substantially different game. I only mention that because I thought I was going to like Recruits much more than this. However, Breach and Clear is clearly winning right now. You dont have to love (or even like) turn-based tactical games to have fun with this.

What unit you select decides the starter attributes of your guys, one will have their special ability trained up nice, other will have reaction time up, other accuracy etc.\n\nThen you run through the missions, and I really mean run, as once you discover the one tactic that works 100% of the time against the AI, you'll just breeze through. Not much depth here, and the occasional weird glitch with your guys running backwards or facing a wall for no good reason.\n\nYour guys gain experience, and you get money, so in-between you level up your guys (in the end, it doesnt matter much what squad you made, they'll all end up the same just look different), buy them some new weapons and gear.\n\nYou can upgrade weapons to modify their stats, but here you'll end up again with all the same upgrades as there is one good combination.\n\nSounds like not much, but it is a decent enough time-killer, pick it up when it is on sale.\n\n\nIn case 3d is not that important to you, I'd suggest to take a look at 'Door Kickers', that one has tactical gameplay down to perfection.","January 18, 2015","true","4.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I played the heck out of it on Android, and decided to get this on Steam even though I basically completed the game on Android. Decent PC port I'd have to say, though it is a fairly basic game as far as PC games are concerned with a focus on gameplay.\n\nI'd compare it most to Frozen Synapse, though this with a real-life visual interface makes it better for me and it is also much less complex to get into. Some elements of XCOM thrown in for good measure as well.\n\nLots of content, that's one thing for sure. To merely complete all the missions (7 locations, five maps per location, 3 scenarios per map), you have 105 missions to play. Which is a lot. Missions aren't super long. The earlier maps are smaller, while as you progress they get much bigger.\n\nLots of different weapons customization, and the 5-point difficulty scale adds quite a significant amount of depth to the game. There are six different classes, though I must admit I never fully utilized each class to its advantage in the mobile version so this is something I seek to correct on my current PC playthrough.\n\nAt the end of the day, Breach & Clear is a game that would delight tactical strategy gamers. It can be played in short bursts, rewards planning (and risks) and has a lot of content to offer. So much of content I am sure you'll never play all the levels in the game! $15 may be a tad too high an asking price, but the $10 it is on launch sale now seems like a good trade-off.\n\nRecommended!","March 24, 2014","true","19.1"," 2 of 50 people (4%) found this review helpful","4","2","50","0","0"

There isn't anything seriously bad about it, but there isn't much that is great either.\nI bought this game during a sale for less than $5.00 and I don't think I would have paid more for it.\nIt's fun little game, but it feels just a step above a java game that you could play on your browser. It's pretty addicting just like some of those simple games are as well.\nI haven't played a game like this before, but I hear that there are similar ones with more depth.\n--WHO THIS GAME IS FOR--\nSomeone who is just interested in some casual tactical gaming. Pleased enough with moderate strategy gaming.\n\nThe Good:\n++Levels aren't dreadfully long (about 6 minutes) but there are 7 countries to visit, each with 5 levels to play in. Also 3 game modes (Terrorist Hunt, Bomb Defusal, and Escape Plan) using same maps, This may not seem like alot but it manages to have just enough variety\n++There are a lot of options with costomization and I've found myself really thinking about my purchases for guns.\n--However, there is a problem with costomization that I will get into later\n++Option to play with Permanent death of squad members to earn extra XP (You get a replacement if one dies but you have to rank them back up) You keep the dead members expensive weapon equipment, which is good.\n++Upgrading skills for your soldiers is pretty solid with the variety of options (Responce, Accuracy, Health, Speed, Evation and an Skill that goes with the soldier's role; Like Squad Leader gets leadership skill you can upgrade). Not too easy to upgrade but not too hard.\n++I like that you can assign roles to your 4 person squad (Leader, Medic, Breach, ect) and that they get perks unlocked as you level up.\n\nThe Bad:\nI'm going to begine with the costomization options\n++There are MANY different guns (some same price and same specs though)\nOn the guns you can pack them with Optics, Lasers, Grips, Flashlights, Supressors, Gas System, and Triggers\nThe problem is that There are only a handful of attatchments in each category and it's easy to max out on the Optics, Lasers, Grips, Flashlights. There are no tactical thinking involved in these options because they only improve accuracy and have no negatives, so you don't weigh your options. -It's pretty mindless\n--The good thing is that Suppressors, Gas Systems,  and Triggers provide certain pros and cons that make you consider what perks you want and the expense of something.\nThere are vests and other things but to buy that are important, but there are many items like clothing, goggles and facepaint that provide NO perks.\n++The Main Menu is slow and kinda laggy and brings a bad first impression when you put your mouse over a button and it takes 3 seconds for it to light up. The response when you select it is absolutely normal. But makes the game seem cheap.\n++The strategy is pretty basic. I've only felt trapped and in trouble a few times. The gameplay is mostly all about keeping your guys near cover and know how to split up your guys (which isn't challenging)\nIf you 4 star all the maps as you progress Like I do and not jump ahead two counties (with harder soldiers) it doesn't stay very challenging. (I went two counties ahead and within two moves I was surounded and lost a guy right when he got shot at) -RIP Brett Breachers\n++I'm playing the levels in Germany, (which is the 4th country) and the environment is pretty static. Only a few levels actually had 1-3 of the soldiers walking around in real time as you plan out your strategy.\n\nTHE UGLY\n++The ugly part isn't in the gameplay. It is with selecting items in the market and selecting the items when you choose a new gun or add attatchments.\n+The interface with the Market and costomization is terrible.\n+When I purchase a new gun I have to make sure to detatch everything on the previous gun, and there isn't any fast/easy way to do it (Such as putting a small 'x' in the corner). I have to select the icon individually for Lasers, Optics, Grips ect. THEN select to 'unequip' this gets very Tedious when there are 7 attachment types.\n+The interface only shows you the picture of what items are attached to your gun with no name of them or what their specs are.\n+You have to go to unequip it and then mouse over it to view its specs.\n+Another problem is that it doesn't tell you the name of what gun your soldier is equiped with. You have to memorize its shape and look in the market so you can compare it to a new weapon.\n+When you want to compare weapons in the market you can't do it side by side. You have to click the gun, then scoll down/up the list to view the next one. That is teious as well.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nI give the game a 6.5/10 -Would not pay $15.00, wait for a sale of less than $7 if you aren't sure about this. Addicting to play but almost too simple to call it a strategy game.\n\n+It needs improvements to make the game more interesting and needs its interface to be changed.\n+Would be interesting to add multiplayer of terrorists vs Spec Ops. Where each team has to make their moves and then it plays out.\n+Another request would be to add new scenarios (This might be later in the maps, IDK yet) with a less static environment and enemies. Like Helicopter, or enemies driving in the stronghold with vehicles.","January 10, 2015","true","20.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Squad customization is moderately deep, but there simply aren't enough options for equipment and gear to make it a true tactics sim. Some of the animations are a little buggy, and the whole game feels like it's not quite polished. The maps are pretty well made and provide good variation in theme and replayability. Some are a little hard to read or see clearly but they are great for the current game - but again, they lack the depth of strategic options that I would like.

The game has 3 different mission types, unfortunately all played on the same maps, there are a few different nations that maps take place in, Afghanistan, Turkey, Germany, China and i believe there is also a South American country, can't remember which one, there are 4 different star ratings and 4 or 5 difficulties (can't remember), this equates to 2,000 possible stars, once you unlock a certain ammount of stars this allows you to buy weapons and gear for your squad with in-game currency called "Silver", i'm assuming there are 2,000 possible stars because the last weapon is 2,000 stars to unlock, i've played 10 hours and have approximately  140 stars. If you buy this game you're in it for the long haul, but if truly invested this game will keep you playing for a long time.

PDW or the P90 is too easy to use, just add a -0.2 gas system and you get the fastest rate of fire in the game which is 0.01 ROF. I mean who cares about the -30 accuracy when you can just spray like a noob =) and steamroll room after room. Also, snipers are WAY too underpowered, low dmg when it hits, low accuracy at long ranges. stats should be increased twicefold to like 150 ACC and 200 DMG(around 2 hits long range and crits close range?) which makes this the lowest DPS in the game and hense the worst gun in the game. If you are only going to get it for supression on the germany maps, i mean theres no point since in 5-6 moves my team will probably finish the game by then. Shotguns should also have their dmg increased since they are also rather weak due to low ROF. you should remove the birdshot feature(cone dmg to room) and go with buckshot. perhaps like a high dmg close range to justify the worth but i guess overall right now its usable.(perhaps intended feature for clearing crowded rooms? useless when shooting on the move and turning a corner, able to get one shot off before enemy takes him down.) Anyways looking aside these recommends, a good game!","June 5, 2014","true","34.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The simple yet expansive ideas it brings to the table makes it the best (if not one of the best) games I've ever spent $5-10 on.\n\nPros:\n+Artwork is really nice.\n+Seemingly endless customization. You pick a spec op group (I think there's 5). You pick out a pre-made face for that person. You pick out each individual person for your 4 person squad. Each spec op class has specific duties. There are more than 4 different classes, so it forces you to be creative with your team.\n+ Each person carries weapons, apparel, and equipment that you personally customize for them. You can buy and sell all of these at the marketplace.\n+If you want to earn money you can grind on any particular mission. Also, these missions have slightly radomized locations for your targets.\n+There are 3 different mission types and each type has 7 locations and 5 missions per location.\n+You can create and switch between multiple squads.\n+Great tutorial\n\nCons:\n-I almost went insane trying to get 4 stars in some levels due to the slightly randomized target location.\n-Some of the guns don't get the stats they deserve. Primarily in range and damage.\n\n9.75/10","July 22, 2014","true","20.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is easy to understand what needs to be done, with previous tactics games experience.\nGame engine is very fast, loading times are almost non existent. No customizable key bindings and very few options to choose from.\n\nStoryline (if we can call it like that), is almost non existant and boring and it is up to player to understand, why and where something should be used.\n\nNo dialogues, but at least they are not like in "Arma Tactics". I don't know, do I need them, if there is such a low level storyline.\n\nLevel design is cool. Enviroment allows many different routes and entry points, there are cover possibilities and ability to lock the doors, to limit movement of enemy. in addition to that, there are random spawns and at the start of the map, you are able to time the best situation, when to start to fight, because there are patrolling guards.\n\nI play it on hard mode and find it only bit challenging. Enemy AI is ok, still, there are different enemies that are made "dumber" and some, are made much stronger and uses better cover. It is hard to tell quality of AI.\n\nPlayer is able to choose which missions to play and they are located all over the world. There is no feel of some specific game world that you are in/sorrounded, which is sad. With same options, but in different arrangement, this would be much cooler game. There is money and between missions, you can change loadout of squads. Many weapons, but most of them are only slightly different, and are not ever bought/used. Loadout is uncomfortable and could use some help from UX specialists.\n\nGraphics are nice. Only couple graphical issues during loadout, but none during gameplay. Has some usability issues, and UI inconveniences, but overall, very nice experience. I would like destructable environment and more realistic explosions and bullet marks on walls, etc.\n\nSound effects are OK, because music is repeative, some effects has annoying sound and could be more realistic.\n\nAfter horrible experience with "Arma Tactics", I recommend this game, to any X-Com, Fallout BOS and Commandos fans out there.","July 5, 2014","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You get to command squad of four elite soldiers in various missions. There are a lot of missions to complete and they are fast going, so it is good for casual players. All missions come in three variants - kill all bad guys, find and defuse bomb (just like kill all but additionally defuse), escape (kind of wierd, you need to quite the map full of bad guys as they ambushed your team).\n\nTactical combat is easy - you set path of move for your soldiers and what way they look, they will attack themself. There is cover system easy to use, so your soldier hide behind walls, or some low covers and keep shooting, you can also open doors and shoot inside the room.\n\nYou get to equip your team with vests, weapons, consumables like granades or medkits and few just wardrobe items. What bothers me is a complete lack of any description of the items, like there is energy drink consumable but I have no idea what it does and why take red bull instead of frag or medkit ...\nLack of descriptions gets a bit worse when it comes to guns, they have stats, so you would think that more the better yes? Well not always, you wanna get more accuracy, but you wanna lower your ROF because the lower ROF the faster soldier states, although descriptions states *increases the amount of rounds being fired*, wierd. It would be also nice to see before buying a gun what attachments it accepts, I have busted some resource cash on guns with nice stats but without option to use silencer.\n\nAll in all it is nice game. I recommend it.\n\nFew ideas what could be improved in the game:\n-difficulty balancing (even without best guns and top levels of soldiers you can easly clear highest difficulties)\n-limit FOW to soldier sight, not to open doors (I can sometimes see what's inside very last room because some terrorist opened doors to it, and none of my soldier have line of sight there)\n-possibility to switch soldier in team, as of now you create squad of four and only that four can be in that squad for ever.","June 30, 2014","true","22.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The combat was very good and provided room to run different strategies many times on the same level. Personally I found that the difficulty of the levels varied significantly. For example, for the Germany missions, I had to use 5 defibrilators and had to replay the previous missions to purchase the sniper rifle to be able to complete them on EASY. Whereas with the subsequent Russia missions, it was basically the Afghanistan missions with more enemies. I liked that you have a variety of teams to choose from (Even though the majority are American), and I hope that they add more operators in the future. One thing I  did not like was that there is very little variety in the weapons. Every unit other than JTF2 gets an M4 SOPMOD as their original weapon (Including the SAS, KSK and Spetznaz), and then, when you choose to upgrade your weapons, almost all of the weapons are SCAR, M1014 or AR15 based weapons. The ONLY exceptions are the pump action shotguns, the AWP, the LaRue OBR 7.62, the MK48 and the P90. Not a single AK, L85 or G36 based weapon in sight. Honestly, the lack of accuracy with weapons bugged me a lot more than it would probably bug other people. All in all, its a solid game but it could use or could have used some work in my opinion. 6.5-10","August 25, 2014","true","34.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

The game is simple enough to get the hang of with just enough customization to keep those already locked in further entertained as the game progresses.\n\nI lost many hours to this game, but just be aware that most the missions are very similar, so if you are driven by story and lack of continuity, this is not your ideal game. But if you love just trying to complete mission after mission while trying to reach the max ranking (4 stars) then look no further.

I usually don't like this style of game and I wasn't expecting much when I purchased it, but I was quite impressed.\n\nThe amount of customization is enough to keep you occupied for hours. There are several special forces factions to choose from, each having a minor stat boost to differentiate from the others. You can customize every soldier in your squad, unfortunately you do have to pick from premade looks but there's so many that it's not that big of a deal. After you've given your soldier his look you can pick one of the classes/roles, each having their own bonuses and skills that unlock as you level the soldier up. Then there is gun customization, there are a lot of guns to choose from, though it can take a while to unlock some of them. Unfortunately most of the guns are just different versions of the same gun with different stats. Furthermore you can equip scopes, lasers, flash lights, triggers, grips, and even change the gas system. After you have your soldiers outfitted with guns there are several helmets, vests, camos, etc. to choose from. It's really amazing for such a small game to have customization that rivals games like Battlefield.\n\nThe gameplay is fun and thoughtful planning is your best weapon. Once you get a handle of the game the earlier difficulty levels can become sort of a faceroll, but don't worry there's multiple difficulty levels and you can tell a difference on each one. If you want to make it even harder on yourself you can select the permanent death option which is exactly as it sounds, contrary to the regular mode where your soldier will just be out of that battle but back again after the mission is over. I've always been a fan of hardcore modes in games so this was a great feature for me, though it caused me some pain a few times when I had almost max level soldiers die, then had to replace them with a fresh level 1.\n\nMy only issue with the game is there is I guess you could say an "OP" gun. I will not list which gun this is as I don't want to ruin anyones experience with the game. But once I outfitted all four of my soldiers with this gun the game was too easy even on the hardest difficulties.\n\nAll in all, a surprisingly impressive game. 9/10","January 23, 2015","true","154.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I liked that I wasnt forced to pay for half of the content like in the mobile version, where you had to pay for 2 squads (KSK and Spetsnaz), clothing and headgear, along with the Russian and Colombian locations. I liked playing with the content I havent purchased on mobile. I did buy the Frozen Synapse DLC and really liked the level design so far. Overall if you are a fan of these types of games I would highly reccomend. The customization of your own squad is a really cool feature, being able to use different uniforms and body armor, plus brightly colored guns. Not very difficult to play at first, but as you play higher difficulties it does require some tactics to overcome the many enemies you will find in those insane-level missions. Overall a 9/10. Fun tactical turn based strategy dosent take long to learn, with plenty of replayability once you have maxed out one squad. Just move on to another.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/comandobee/recommended/266130/","comandobee","comandobee","http://steamcommunity.com/id/comandobee/","212 products in account","TL;DR: Great light strategy game that will be very addicting for the first few hours for most. In a nutshell, it is a turn based strategy game in which you must complete levels to unlock new and better stuff, to be able to accomplish new and harder levels! Standard procedure really.\n\nBreach and Clear (B&C) is a port of what was original a mobile game (IOS, Android). It does have added content, however its origins still show through its simpicity. The graphics are decent and hold up to HD displays. but this the main improvement. It depicts multiple representations of real world Special Operations groups in a variety of environments, with the player being the commander that holds an eagle eye of the battlefield. The authenticity of much of the info in the game (such as the loading screen tips) is indeed relevant and true to modern day SOF, although the "tactics" the game pushes aren't necessarily completely accurate due to the reliance on user input of what to do.\n\nTechnical Performance: Although I am running this on "gaming" (albeit aging) hardware, it should hold up on almost any machine at a very nice framerate. There's really nothing intensive computationally in the game. Loading times between levels  are minimal. The only adjustable settings in the graphics section are antialiasing (up to 8x), game resolution/full screen, and vsync.\n\nStarting out: There are 7 factions (squads) that you can choose from to customize, each with their own unique skill boosts. There's no context on why one might be better than the others, so it's essentially just luck. There's no reason to slave over the decision, I'd recommend just picking the squad you think looks the best aesthetically. You then select from a multitude of soldier types to fill your squad. This decision matters quite a bit as each has its own special abilities that have huge value on the battlefield. As long as you pick a variety (one of each), again don't think too hard about it. Afterward, you go through a relatively short tutorial that shows off the game's mechanics and basic strategies. Very easy to pick up, unlike some strategy games that overload my brain (and processor) from the get-go.\n\nEntertainment value: I personally wore out most of the game around 10 hours, going through every mission (7 total) and sub level (5 per mission, making 35 total playable stages without DLC) at first on normal difficulty then attempting them on insane. I've found that insane generally is actually quite doable for the most part, although on some levels (especially on the "escape plan" gamemode) they are quite impossible to perfect. There are 3 game modes: terrorist hunt (eliminate all hostiles), bomb defusal (reach and defuse one or two bombs), and escape plan (get as many squads members as possible to a position on the map). Each gamemode reuses the same missions and sub-levels, however the initial position of your soldiers varies. The reuse of the stages does get tiring eventually, but each stage provides enough enough entertaininment for a few plays. At the end of each sub level, player performance is rated on a scale of 1-4 stars, 4 being perfect or somewhat close to it. Criteria (as far as I can tell) is the time spent and how many squad members went down during the course of the sub level (this is the larger of the two criteria). Stars actually matter as they unlock the ability to purchase new guns (all accessories and gear are unlocked at default. Completion of a sub level also awards a certain amount of money, which can be spent on better equipment (guns, gear, etc).\n-As a little side note, it's interesting to see B&C incorporating a lot of big name brands into the game, such as but not limited to Crye Precision, Tyr Tactical, and Surefire. Even if the company doesn't have a nod, their equipment is still featured (LBT 6094, Giessele triggers, and a LOT more). This defintely is a seldom-seen feature that adds a authenticity.\nOne of the flaws I see in the game is the lack of thought as far as gun and equipment upgrades. It's somewhat 2-Dimmensional, as there is often a clear "X plate carrier is better than Y plate carrier in every category". It seems almost carelessly done, as it significantly dims the strategic value of many purchases. In the end, out of the 18 long rifles featured, I purchased maybe 10 of them, skipping from the default rifle (M4 carbine) to some of the higher end guns by patience and thriftiness.\n\nGameplay: Quite fun, but reptitive after everything worth buying is unlocked. Each turn is worth 5 seconds, and works in a way similar to Fire Emblem. You start each sub level by picking from 1-4 entry points that your troops can breach through, and work your way to the objective. Each soldier has a movement range, effective firing range, etc depending on their stats and equipment, so each squad member has the potential to be very diffferent from the next. Sub level design is actually quite thorough, albeit somewhat linear at times. Usually, there are a few ways to approach an objective, through different paths. Object placement is realistic, and although this sometimes does not work out tactically, the developers really try their best to keep gameplay relatively balanced. Experimenting with new unlocks in different situations also adds to replayability, however in the end there's really only a couple of guns that players might choose to switch betweeen as they are superior to all others. I feel that some of the elements of the game, such as stealth, do not matter in the end. The developers seemed to have added them in as they are viable in real life, but the way the game works makes it relatively ineffective and I end up shooting my way through every mission anyway.\n\nPlot: There is no plot to B&C, not really even a true attempt at one, however this works out for the game. There are 7 "missions" that take place in different countries/stages, each with 5 sub-levels that have short descriptors which are essentially formalities.\n\nUser Interface: The UI is especially important for strategy games as it can be confusing for newer players who have not learned what each button does. However, B&C is a relatively simple game that, once you go through the initial tutorial, you've pretty much mastered the controls. Everything is very intuitive and well organized.\n","July 26, 2014","true","13.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Gameplay is in the title, you're counter terrorists breaching an area and clearing it out.\n\nIt gets a little more complicated than that of course, who goes in first, what weapon they're equipped with, how long you look at an area, you plan it out hit "Breach" and watch it all go to plan. Or all go to hell if you didn't take into account a possible sniper.\n\nIt's not as good as Frozen Synapse, but FS is on a whole other level compared to most games and a lot of people find find FS a bit too cereberal. For those who want the challenge of planning but don't want to start counting miliseconds and take every single possible combination into account, Breach And Clear is for you. It's thoughtful enough to be a challenge, with a clean UI, reasonable customisation, a nice learning curve, and enough maps to keep you busy for a while.\n\nNotes:\nYou unlock weapons with stars, you get stars from clearing maps on each difficulty. 4 stars for a good clear on Easy, on Normal, on Hard, on Insane, on... Elite? Either way, when you see firearms that need 400 stars to unlock it isn't as bad as it looks as when you clear a map on Hard, it automatically registers as cleared on Easy and Normal as well. 12 stars for once through.\n\nYour units level up and you can apply their stats wherever you want, there's six classes to choose from, four in a squad, and yes you can run four of the same type. Should you? Well that depends on your playstyle. Four Direct Action units with different weapons can be one hell of a rush. Literally, lots of sprinting and shotguns in that style. Those damnable snipers never saw it coming.\n\nMax level of 30, turn perma death on and you'll hit 30 by the time you're through your third country (7 countries, 5 areas each, three game modes (Clear, Defuse, Escape), that's 105 different runs you can make before it gets repetitive, 120 with DLC), which gives you plenty of time to start on another squad or three.\n\nEach class is balanced, Direct Action and Intelligence are fun as rushers and ninjas/scouts respectively, Medic's make sure no-one goes down, Breachers have a thing for grenades, Weapons Sgt can suppress, and Fireteam Leader's give everyone bonus everything, but none of them are clear winners. It depends more on playstyle than game stats.\n\nReasonable amount of guns. I'd have preferred more, and more variety, as well as grenade launchers, rocket launchers, etc, but it's not bad.\n\nIt's definitely a port, there's a little too much clicking when equipping mods to weapons, but it's laid out nicely so there's that.\n\nSeven squad types, eight with DLC, each of them give bonus points to certain stats so again there's no clear winner. Simply go with the one that fits your playstyle or which you find the prettiest of them all.\n\nSummary\n\nIf you don't like the idea of a tactical turn based squad shooter, then this is going to suck. For those who do enjoy the genre or would like a nice entry point to it, Breach And Clear is it. And afterwards if you feel like more of a challenge, Frozen Synapse it is; because chess was just too easy.\n\n9/10, worth full price, DLC worthwhile.","April 12, 2015","true","31.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game alllows for very fast progress, and you can get into it very quickly. It allows for the option of class specialization, and that prompts you to create new squads for different mission scenarios. I highly recommend getting the Frozen Synapse DLC if you don't own Frozen Synapse. Ultimately, this game is very well put together, although, the UI might be able to use some work to make it more convenient, but that's my only complaint with it.","April 12, 2015","true","54.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The enemy AI is kind of a joke and you have no way to tell your guys to hold fire. They spray lead at everything in their view instead of waiting to get in to a superior position. This often leads to them taking unnecessary damage and is tactically idiotic.\nExample: 4 tango with backs to entry point. Your team enters and opens fire as soon as they enter while moving to cover. They kill all 4 tangos but take damage in the exchange of gunfire. Had they held fire till in cover, they would be far less likey to take damage while maintaining their advantage of surprise and position.\n\nGame lacks "go codes" like Door Kickers does so well. In the planning stage, there is no time representation so you can't see how many seconds it will take to move someone to a position. No hold position/delay for X time command. No shoot at this target till threat is removed, then continue with plan. You can't pick which targets to shoot at so no way to prioritize targets. Therefore you can't tell your guys to focus the sniper standing in the open vs the shotguner in heavy cover who happends to be a bit closer.\n\nAnother glaring problem is that every gun unlocked after the CTAR has not been an upgrade. Currently at 472 stars. Laughing at how many stars are required to unlock the later shotguns. Game is getting far too boring and repetitive to ever reach 1400 let alone the 2100 for the last rifle.\n\nFrom the Devs "The higher star guns are more for 'prestige' than anything else. They were added as    a prize for fans who wanted something out of the ordinary, so they are camouflaged or Platinum/Gold versions of earlier guns."\nPrestige in a single player game? Umm OK.\n\nNo way to tell what is required to reach 4 stars on any given map. Every map and scenario has different requirements, but game fails to tell you what you are aiming for.  Use an item on one map, ok. Use the same item on another and lose a star but won't tell you are being deducted. Did I get 3 stars on my last try because I didn't make time or due to using an item? No Fn idea. Huge fail IMO.\n\nNot enough variety of weapons. One assault rifle after another. Outside of the of the P90, game lacks submachine guns like a variant of the MP5, MP7A1 or UMP. Guess this is due to the squads being military and not law enforcement. These are guns I would expect to find in the arsenal of a game that focuses on CQB regadless of the operators.\n\nGame is more arcade'ish than tactically sound.

PDW or the P90 is too easy to use, just add a -0.2 gas system and you get the fastest rate of fire in the game which is 0.01 ROF. I mean who cares about the -30 accuracy when you can just spray like a noob =) and steamroll room after room. Also, snipers are WAY too underpowered, low dmg when it hits, low accuracy at long ranges. stats should be increased twicefold to like 150 ACC and 200 DMG(around 2 hits long range and crits close range?) which makes this the lowest DPS in the game and hense the worst gun in the game. If you are only going to get it for supression on the germany maps, i mean theres no point since in 5-6 moves my team will probably finish the game by then. Shotguns should also have their dmg increased since they are also rather weak due to low ROF. you should remove the birdshot feature(cone dmg to room) and go with buckshot. perhaps like a high dmg close range to justify the worth but i guess overall right now its usable.(perhaps intended feature for clearing crowded rooms? useless when shooting on the move and turning a corner, able to get one shot off before enemy takes him down.)

It's not an in-depth strategy/tactics game like Jagged Alliance 1&2 and even less complex than XCOM:Enemy Unknown, but it's still a fun game that applies the same principle: find the right mix of weapons, skills and positioning to beat the opposition. Since you can't target enemies and have to rely on your squad to pick the targets, positioning and telling your squad where to look is key. Your options may be reduced, but it's also focussed and does this part really well. The pacing for unlocks is also done in a good way, by completing missions and doing well in them you earn stars which in turn unlock equipment for your team. Since you can jump in and out of campaigns it's a game you don't necessarily need to play for longer sessions, you can just jump in and play for 10 minutes and still finish a mission or two.\n\nThe price in comparison to the mobile version is also not as horrible as it seems at first glance since you get alot more content than the mobile base version has.\n\nMy main complaint about this game would be the lack of information or tool tips. Some things are left unexplained an you have to figure it out yourself, some information is only available on the loading screens - which you will never get to read on a modern gaming PC, because they pass by in seconds. Some might see that as an oldschool approach to game design, but that doesn't make it any better.\n\nOn the technical side this game is a port from a mobile platform and it shows. The graphics are simply outdated, the variety of animations is very limited. On the plus side the optimization seems to be decent, so loading times are swift and the performance is very good, even on older machines. The sound design is okay, too. Balance is ok, music isn't annoying, shots go pop and grenades go bang, some radio communication inbetween. Nothing special, but it works.\n\nIn about 11 hours of playtime I have experienced one interface freeze, but no crashes, sound loops or graphical errors. And this also gives you a rough estimate of playtime: if you like round based tactics, this will entertain you for ten to 15 hours, depending on how much you are into unlocks and earnings stars.\n\nOverall this isn't a contender for GOTY, but a enjoyable round based snack for inbetween and at 9€ this was worthy buy.","March 28, 2014","true","11.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For example, the British SAS specializes in Evasion.\n\nIf you're looking for a good top-down tactical shooter (or disappointed with Black Ops II's Strike Force missions), this is most definitely for you.

It contains fun squad tactics and a nice customization system, however it does not have any base manage ment and I felt very little difference between each soldier also my UI seems to be a little bugged my weapon attachments for trigger and gass system does not show me what I have equiped (just the blank grey slot). Overall there are some Improvesments that would help this game apeal more (base management, some sort of global event system with a persistent story line that drives the missions, a way to move soldiers from one squad to another, squad wipes [yes there is NO WAY to wipe out your squad one will always survive even with perma death enabled], and a way to delete squads, oh and  better UI for PC) I give it a 5.7/10.\n\n(after a few more hours and an update)\n\nThe experience can grow old a little bit after you reach that 5 hour play time mark when it comes to your squads. I just feel there isn't that much variety with the soldiers (and even the squads for that matter), a perfect way to fix this is to allow players to move soldiers around from squad to squad revamp the whole system. If the changes were up to me I would make it so you buy "squad slots" and soldiers. So instead of having a squads with just one type of nationality you just buy a squad slot that allows you to have a squad then you buy men from the factions (S.A.S, SEALS, etc) this way you can have an intelligence officer and a weapon sergeant from from say JTF2 a SL from the Rangers and a breacher from the Seals. This is just a quick raw idea to give the players more dimensions to play with. The replayability of the missions is quite high and still very enjoyable I didn't think it would be so since you don't really have that many maps to choose from but the random enemy position with different game modes (well done with the game modes devs, I would like to see more of those maybe a hostage rescue game) really make this game experience last. So tho the squads are quite lacking the fact that it got me hooked until now forces me to give it a new rating of a solid 7/10 (which surpasses the rating I gave X-Com 6.3 not saying BNC is better it just gave me more fun for allot longer than X-Com did, I got bored of X-Com : Enemy Unknown after my first campaign and with Enemy Within same story) assuming BNC gets more work done on it, it might become the best squad tactics game ever made (strictly squad tactics, and I did try allot of squad tactics so I am entitled to say that.)","March 26, 2014","true","15.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Winning missions yields experience to level up allowing distribution of skill points and buying loadout upgrades for all team members.  Acheive level milestones to unlock perks that can help you successfully complete missions.\n\nThat's it - Play to win.  Nothing more or less.  While I too agree there could be an extra element of depth be it in customization or tactics,  I've paid way more for games that I stopped playing after only an hour so in my opinion, this game is a winner.","March 24, 2014","true","20.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is easy to understand what needs to be done, with previous tactics games experience.\nGame engine is very fast, loading times are almost non existent. No customizable key bindings and very few options to choose from.\n\nStoryline (if we can call it like that), is almost non existant and boring and it is up to player to understand, why and where something should be used.\n\nNo dialogues, but at least they are not like in "Arma Tactics". I don't know, do I need them, if there is such a low level storyline.\n\nLevel design is cool. Enviroment allows many different routes and entry points, there are cover possibilities and ability to lock the doors, to limit movement of enemy. in addition to that, there are random spawns and at the start of the map, you are able to time the best situation, when to start to fight, because there are patrolling guards.\n\nI play it on hard mode and find it only bit challenging. Enemy AI is ok, still, there are different enemies that are made "dumber" and some, are made much stronger and uses better cover. It is hard to tell quality of AI.\n\nPlayer is able to choose which missions to play and they are located all over the world. There is no feel of some specific game world that you are in/sorrounded, which is sad. With same options, but in different arrangement, this would be much cooler game. There is money and between missions, you can change loadout of squads. Many weapons, but most of them are only slightly different, and are not ever bought/used. Loadout is uncomfortable and could use some help from UX specialists.\n\nGraphics are nice. Only couple graphical issues during loadout, but none during gameplay. Has some usability issues, and UI inconveniences, but overall, very nice experience. I would like destructable environment and more realistic explosions and bullet marks on walls, etc.\n\nSound effects are OK, because music is repeative, some effects has annoying sound and could be more realistic.\n\nAfter horrible experience with "Arma Tactics", I recommend this game, to any X-Com, Fallout BOS and Commandos fans out there.","July 5, 2014","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The combat was very good and provided room to run different strategies many times on the same level. Personally I found that the difficulty of the levels varied significantly. For example, for the Germany missions, I had to use 5 defibrilators and had to replay the previous missions to purchase the sniper rifle to be able to complete them on EASY. Whereas with the subsequent Russia missions, it was basically the Afghanistan missions with more enemies. I liked that you have a variety of teams to choose from (Even though the majority are American), and I hope that they add more operators in the future. One thing I  did not like was that there is very little variety in the weapons. Every unit other than JTF2 gets an M4 SOPMOD as their original weapon (Including the SAS, KSK and Spetznaz), and then, when you choose to upgrade your weapons, almost all of the weapons are SCAR, M1014 or AR15 based weapons. The ONLY exceptions are the pump action shotguns, the AWP, the LaRue OBR 7.62, the MK48 and the P90. Not a single AK, L85 or G36 based weapon in sight. Honestly, the lack of accuracy with weapons bugged me a lot more than it would probably bug other people.

I usually don't like this style of game and I wasn't expecting much when I purchased it, but I was quite impressed.\n\nThe amount of customization is enough to keep you occupied for hours. There are several special forces factions to choose from, each having a minor stat boost to differentiate from the others. You can customize every soldier in your squad, unfortunately you do have to pick from premade looks but there's so many that it's not that big of a deal. After you've given your soldier his look you can pick one of the classes/roles, each having their own bonuses and skills that unlock as you level the soldier up. Then there is gun customization, there are a lot of guns to choose from, though it can take a while to unlock some of them. Unfortunately most of the guns are just different versions of the same gun with different stats. Furthermore you can equip scopes, lasers, flash lights, triggers, grips, and even change the gas system. After you have your soldiers outfitted with guns there are several helmets, vests, camos, etc. to choose from. It's really amazing for such a small game to have customization that rivals games like Battlefield.\n\nThe gameplay is fun and thoughtful planning is your best weapon. Once you get a handle of the game the earlier difficulty levels can become sort of a faceroll, but don't worry there's multiple difficulty levels and you can tell a difference on each one. If you want to make it even harder on yourself you can select the permanent death option which is exactly as it sounds, contrary to the regular mode where your soldier will just be out of that battle but back again after the mission is over. I've always been a fan of hardcore modes in games so this was a great feature for me, though it caused me some pain a few times when I had almost max level soldiers die, then had to replace them with a fresh level 1.\n\nMy only issue with the game is there is I guess you could say an "OP" gun. I will not list which gun this is as I don't want to ruin anyones experience with the game. But once I outfitted all four of my soldiers with this gun the game was too easy even on the hardest difficulties.\n\nAll in all, a surprisingly impressive game. 9/10","January 23, 2015","true","154.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's got a lot of customization to it, which I really enjoy, but from what I can tell there aren't that many missions to play.  In addition, once you figure out the proper "plan of attack", which I figured out in the first 5 minutes of the first mission, you can pretty much use the same tactic every mission and you'll never loose.  It's a pretty good game for what it is, but I wish it would have had "more" to it.  Never the less, I'm going to recommend it.","June 7, 2014","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is a simple tactical game based on movement and angle of sight. Levelling up your soldiers makes the game enjoyable. However the game does feel it is missing more content, like more mission or even more perks for your soldiers. There is plenty of gear to purchase using you well rewarded in-game cash. There is also a large range of mods for your chosen guns.\n\nThe graphics are simple with only little bit of detail but enough for the game to look good.\n\nThe sound effects are very simple specially the environmental tracks while playing the missions.\nThe gun shot effects are again simple but effective.\n\nControls with the mouse can get a little annoying at times. When you try to move the camera around you will regularly place a move node for one of you soldiers.\n\nI do recommend this game because it is fun and enjoyable to play but the game does feel cheaper the its current price tag of £10.99p.","May 10, 2014","true","59.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You take command of a special forces squad of your choosing, and plan your attack on objective based missions (terrorist hunt, bomb defusal or extraction). You have a reasonably wide selection of weapons available, though weapons used by some special forces are absent from the game. Enemy engagements are always lethal, as there is no option to simply incapacitate. The inability to set timings is also detrimental to tactics.\n\nOverall the game is entertaining enough to keep you playing for hours, but it lacks scope and depth in comparison to tactical predecessors such as Deadline (1996, Millennium Interactive). The graphics and audio are good, but I'd like to see some destructability, and a greater range of weapons and consumables (no smoke grenades or CS gas?).\n\n7/10 - Still playing it.","January 15, 2015","true","129.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is a simple tactical game based on movement and angle of sight. Levelling up your soldiers makes the game enjoyable. However the game does feel it is missing more content, like more mission or even more perks for your soldiers. There is plenty of gear to purchase using you well rewarded in-game cash. There is also a large range of mods for your chosen guns.\n\nThe graphics are simple with only little bit of detail but enough for the game to look good.\n\nThe sound effects are very simple specially the environmental tracks while playing the missions.\nThe gun shot effects are again simple but effective.\n\nControls with the mouse can get a little annoying at times.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sirknum/recommended/266130/","sirknum","SirKnumskull","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sirknum/","433 products in account","Enjoyable round-based tactics game. It's not an in-depth strategy/tactics game like Jagged Alliance 1&2 and even less complex than XCOM:Enemy Unknown, but it's still a fun game that applies the same principle: find the right mix of weapons, skills and positioning to beat the opposition. Since you can't target enemies and have to rely on your squad to pick the targets, positioning and telling your squad where to look is key. Your options may be reduced, but it's also focussed and does this part really well. The pacing for unlocks is also done in a good way, by completing missions and doing well in them you earn stars which in turn unlock equipment for your team. Since you can jump in and out of campaigns it's a game you don't necessarily need to play for longer sessions, you can just jump in and play for 10 minutes and still finish a mission or two.\n\nThe price in comparison to the mobile version is also not as horrible as it seems at first glance since you get alot more content than the mobile base version has.\n\nMy main complaint about this game would be the lack of information or tool tips. Some things are left unexplained an you have to figure it out yourself, some information is only available on the loading screens - which you will never get to read on a modern gaming PC, because they pass by in seconds. Some might see that as an oldschool approach to game design, but that doesn't make it any better.\n\nOn the technical side this game is a port from a mobile platform and it shows. The graphics are simply outdated, the variety of animations is very limited. On the plus side the optimization seems to be decent, so loading times are swift and the performance is very good, even on older machines. The sound design is okay, too. Balance is ok, music isn't annoying, shots go pop and grenades go bang, some radio communication inbetween. Nothing special, but it works.\n\nIn about 11 hours of playtime I have experienced one interface freeze, but no crashes, sound loops or graphical errors. And this also gives you a rough estimate of playtime: if you like round based tactics, this will entertain you for ten to 15 hours, depending on how much you are into unlocks and earnings stars.\n\nOverall this isn't a contender for GOTY, but a enjoyable round based snack for inbetween and at 9€ this was worthy buy.","March 28, 2014","true","11.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I personally don't have an iOS or Android device, so I wasn't able to play the game prior to its PC release.\n\nThis game simulates rapid close quarter engagements from a top down view. You as the player controls a squad of elite counter-terrorist forces. Using careful movement and tactics, your goal is to move throughout a building complex and eliminate all hostiles as fast as possible.\n\nThe different factions you can play as gives me a really nice immersive feel when I give my men orders. It's not just an aesthetic thing either, every faction has a different stat bonus. For example, the British SAS specializes in Evasion.\n\nIf you're looking for a good top-down tactical shooter (or disappointed with Black Ops II's Strike Force missions), this is most definitely for you. Do not jump into this game thinking you can force your men in rooms like supermen and expect them to go gun blazing, killing terrorists.\n\nMy only gripe with this game is that the game freezes up my computer during the after action reports, forcing me to use task manager to close the game.

Design is tight and levels are short, if it took less time to load and exit I'd call it a coffee-break game. If you played X-COM Enemy Unknown/Within and thought the battles needed to be shorter and tighter, give this one a shot.\n\nThe main draw for most people is probably going to be gun porn, there are dozens of gun and gear options, most of which only require the money you get from clearing missions.  Additional guns, however, are unlocked by scoring well on those missions.  It's a cumulative thing, so if you do horribly on 10-20 missions, you get the same gun as if you did great on five missions.  And of course you can replay the missions to get better rankings.\n\nSound design is nothing to write home about.

Breach & Clear has more in common with Frozen Synapse than it does have in common with X-Com though.\n\nThe gameplay is rather simple. Enemies are randomly seeded into a map, where they will do their terroristy things like inspecting the carpet in an otherwise empty room, and you are tasked with clearing the bad guys, finding a hostage/bomb or escaping to an exfil location. The random seeding of the enemy gives the game quite a bit of replay-ability.\n\nEach level has one or more entry points and you as the player are tasked with dividing your 4 people team among the entry points and then go from there. You plan each move in its entirety and then once you have planned it, you execute said plan. Covering all the angels, trying to use cover to your advantage or throw flashbangs or regular grenades into an area to deal with the enemy.\n\nThe game's simplicity is also its strength. Nobody ever said that chess was a boring game because it had a bunch of simple rules and Breach & Clear is like that as well. You do have a couple tactical options but for the most part its simple facing, facing and positioning, that wins the day.\n\nGraphically the game isn't impressive, but being a spiritual successor to Frozen Synapse it is still a step up from a blue backdrop and green and red enemies. Also I can't quite put my finger on it, why I am liking this game more than I did Frozen Synapse, but I also couldn't name any real difference between the two other than Breach & Clear having the more appealing aesthetic.\n\nBreach & Clear also offers a class and level system, with your team getting more experienced and unlocking more abilities. And there is a shop allowing you to buy new unlocked weapons, equipment and cosmetic items.\n\nAll in all a solid game with, at the very least, the early missions taking about 10 to 15 minutes tops.","August 15, 2015","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

Breach & Clear is a simulator and straightforward. The marginal story only serves as a simplistic backstory to why you are in one country or another. It doesn't matter; you are there to eliminate terrorists. The story only serves to support that.\n\nThe levels are well designed and compact. Graphically the game is simplistic but they serve well enough to set the stage. The locals are diverse and enjoyable, though I found myself employing the same strategies on most occasions. Yet I suppose that’s realistic, whether it is some Russian compound or an office building the principles of clearing a building are the same. Even though the game can feel repetitive I always found myself reloading the game and coming back for more. I still am. I hope they add more maps later on. I know it is wishful thinking but it be endless fun if they added the ability to make your own scenarios and show them to your friends.\n\nThere are a handful of game modes to partake in. Such as bomb disposal, hostage rescue, and the generic eliminate all threats. There are also a handful of difficulties to take part in to test your skills.\n\nThere is also a large amount of upgrades you can do to your characters. There is also a store where you can buy new weapons, accessories, clothing, helmets, and vests. Despite the wide array of options available I never felt that my characters had unique skills that affected my gameplay substantially. I found myself using characters interchangeably regardless of how I loaded them out.\n\nThe UI is simplistic but allows a decent amount of diversity. I do wish they had a mechanism by which you could delay a characters movement. It would have been rather helpful. Overall the game has been enjoyable and I hope to get another five-ten hours out of it before I’m done with it.\n","June 21, 2014","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also, lacking polish in regards to the little things, one of the most clawing is the AWP sniper rifle ejecting multiple brass casings when it fires.\n\nSo, graphics aren't a deal breaker nowadays, so what's the tactical gameplay like? Basic. The game features cover, breaching tactics, and grenades, All were great in X-com: Enemy Unknown, but here they feel very contrived. I have yet to find a good position for my sniper, and enemy snipers start in very good positions. Starting positions in later levels are very impractical, leaving your squad open during the most critical entry moments.\n\nFurthermore, any feature involving doors (any breaching methods, and the ability to wedge doors closed) are not even present in many missions because they take place outside, with no other 'breaching' methods to replace them. I figured outside grenades could serve as a breaching method, but many of the maps are designed in such a way that you cannot throw grenades directly out the doorway to clear yourself an opening.\n\nWhich brings me to enemy placement, which is randomized. Don't get me wrong, randomization brings replayability, but unless you want to spend a fifth of your mission earnings on UAVs for each mission, then you are left with no way of knowing where even basic enemies directly at your starting position are. This turns most missions into a bloody slug-fest as you pray your soldiers can even make it in the door without dying. Especially when mexican cartel snipers are far better shots than your special forces sniper with max accuracy and loaded with high-tech targeting devices.\n\nAt the end of the day, the game uses many of the tired and cheap methods of increasing difficulty that I thought we left behind in the 90s, and for me, that makes this game a far cry shy of being worth 15$.","July 27, 2015","false","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Good and simple controls that make you play in multiple different ways. Could do with more missions, weapons and ways to play once.

It is just the type of game I was looking for, military strategy, that doesn't require 12 hours to play.  Sometimes you want something that is deep and makes you think, but that you can play quickly.  You acn knock out a few rounds in a few minutes, or play for hours.\n\nDeep game play, lots of strategy, and replay value is high.  Highly recommended.","April 12","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
