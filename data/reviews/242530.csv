It still ranks among my all-time favourites.  This version, however, does NOT do it justice.  Rather than being emulated, this version was fully ported to Windows and adapted to support modern machines.  Normally this would be the preferred approach to 'modernizing' a game such as this one, but through porting the game the developers introduced a number of bugs and timing issues that did not exist in the original version.  In a game where twitch-response movement and firing is key, this can be a HUGE problem.\n\nGraphically there's not much to complain about if you turn the pixel smoother / bloom-effect off, but there is still a complaint to be made:  The developers based this port off the AGA version of the game rather than the original ECS version, and as such they adopted the AGA version's heavily critisized over-saturated colour palette and modified sprites.  The ECS version, despite having a lower colour depth, actuall had better sprite detail which was sadly lost in the AGA version.\n\nAchievements and net-play have been added to this port, which is appreciated, however the achievements are broken and the net play is laggy to the point of being almost unplayable.  The devs attempted to fix the netplay code and some of the sound/timing issues, however in doing so their latest patch created other more annoying sound issues which in my opinion actually make the single player campaign unplayable (unless you like a constant distorted screeching sound effect playing at all times after the computer-controlled character teleports to you.)\n\nNormally I wouldn't hold such bugs against the developers if they were still actively working to fix it, however they seem to have given up after the most recent patch (which broke way more than it fixed) and have abandoned the game in its unfinished state.  This really upsets me, as I at least found the game playable before the last patch.\n\nI highly recommend playing The Chaos Engine (Soldiers of Fortune on the Genesis/SNES) but steer clear of this lazy, buggy, abandoned port.  It's not worth the money at all.  Just go download WinUAE and emulate the original ECS Amiga version instead.","December 23, 2013","false","3.8"," 91 of 108 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","91","108","0","3"

Reactions "This game is too hard whine whine whine"\n\nChaos Engine year 2013. Reactions "This game is too hard whine i want this whine i want that what a shame i have been a fan my whole life whine".\n\nI have not yet read any good points why this truly original HD remake game would suck. this game is rock solid in design. I can't even name another game that would be like it and have the same level of thought used to design it. And dont even start on the graphics. they are bitmap brothers style graphics. Their trade mark. Whoever wants to mess with that needs to jump into an icy lake.\n\nRemake adds some functionality but doesn't try to add too much to the mix so it's just 'a HD remake'. Skip the HD jokes. it's 1920x1080 resolution so it's enough to qualify for the 'HD' title in my books. You can even add filters to make it look different - something that can be usefull when played on large TV screens. I personally don't need the extra gimmicks but i don't condemn the game for including them.\n\nSince i dont have a amiga lying around nor will i download pirated images of this game then bying this game is the only way to go. No, i will also not get an amiga just to 'compare the original to the HD remake'. I have fond memories of the original and thats the way i want to keep it. Nitpicking about details that just doesnt matter and then degrading this game furiously is plain stupid.\n\nNo advances in game mechanics in 20 years? Really? New players dont need that and veterans will play it with nostalgia anyway. Formula was perfect then and it's perfect for new players too. Don't spoil it for them.  Too many classics have been spoiled by trying to make them 'better'.\n\nRemakes are always a bit risky for the buyer. some are money grabs. others are cultural events where good games of the past are resurrected and passed on to the next generation. This game (along with another Bitmap Brothers game on steam) is not counted in the money grab games section.","June 24, 2014","true","9.3"," 92 of 110 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","92","110","0","0"

The Chaos Engine is from a time when players were expected to practice until their skills improved enough to progress. If that doesn't sound appealing, then you really won't enjoy this game, nor a great many others from the same era.\n\nI loved this game twenty years ago, and nothing has changed. Literally - despite talk of improvements, this is a thinly veiled emulation job of the Amiga A1200 version of the game. It's a tad disappointing, but the game itself is still as much fun as it ever was. Hopefully one day we'll see some proper Bitmap Brothers remakes, but I don't regret having paid the Â£6.99 for this in the meantime.","December 5, 2013","true","49.3"," 36 of 42 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","36","42","0","1"

Not only that, but they upgraded it with achievements! For those that don't know, Chaos Engine is a difficult cooperative top down 8 way shooter known as Soldiers of Fortune on the Super Nintendo. You select from six mercenaries each with their own weapons, special talents and stats. The stats can even be upgraded every 2 levels by spending currency that you find on the ground and from killing enemies.\n\nSpeaking of killing enemies, don't think this is some cake walk. Every enemy is deadly and can kill you. Your mercenaries body is just as chunky as the enemies, so if they can't dodge your bullets, you can't dodge theirs without some quick reflexes. That alone is a warning, if that's not you, turn around and find another game.\n\nThe controls feel stiff, using the special abilities feels odd, you need to hold one button to prime it and press another when it is ready. Sadly this takes a while, to top that off you can often use two when you only mean to use one. The shooting forces your character to a stand still. This is not a dual stick shooter like Smash TV, you need to face the enemies before you shoot at them. On top of that collision detection seems off in terms of things hitting you when they shouldn't. Even with all of these issues, somehow it all works, its fun and entertaining. Map design is good, each level is almost a maze of staircases and walls that open up to reveal other paths. You'll never get lost and everything seems bite sized in the maze. Finding gold keys will open walls, silver keys will move objects. The object of the game really seems to destroy nodes / towers in each level to open up the exit door.\n\nChaos Engine is a quick game, each world has 4 levels and they feel like a healthy size, just because you can't just run through it, you need to take it slow. The game has limited lives, and you'll find lives along the way, but you can also buy lives and health every 2 levels as well. When you die, you restart at the last checkpoint, but lose all of your lives, you'll need to restart from the last save at the beginning of each level. The gun upgrades are nice and offer more bullets for a wider gun.\n\nThis game is also a forced cooperative game, meaning, even if you're one player alone, the game will stick you with an AI partner. The AI seems competent enough, but you'll still be doing the majority of the work and pushing forward. You can still use 2 player cooperative on the same computer and also 2 player cooperative over Steam, but honestly, I can't find anyone whenever I try to host game or join a game. You can invite friends, but alas no friends have this game. You can make use of your partner's special abilities as long as they're alive. Its a nice feature.\n\nI was lucky enough to pick up this gem of a game in a bundle, and Steam has had it on sale for $2. While I can recommend the game at a full $10, its best that you wait.","July 30, 2014","true","3.3"," 34 of 41 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","34","41","0","0"

It was fun.\n\nThis is not. It's not fun, it's not worth the money I paid for it. The only reasons that I haven't uninstalled it are due to the nostalgia I get from playing it every now and then, as well as it's not taking up a lot of hard disk space. But seriously, you're better off downloading an emulator for the consoles and getting the rom if you're planning to play the game at all.\n\nIt's supposed to be a "remastered" version of the original game, but little about this game seems "remastered". Pointless and useless features don't count, especially those that make the game look worse.\n\nOnline multiplayer is poorly optimized. The framerate drops drastically even if you're playing with a teammate sitting right next to you in the same room.

I highly recommend this game to anyone who was gaming in the early 90s for a good dose of nostalgic rage (when then CPU player takes all your food/power ups!). The majority of the game is flawless but there are still issues which have not been addressed. Like for instance the online multiplayer being laggy to the point of unplayability and some of the achievements are inaccessible/broken. Apprantly there are "minor sound issues" and a friend has also mentioned "laggy menus" but I myself have not experienced these problems or neglected to notice them.

This is not a new remake. As I noticed they changed only three things:\n1. Added a filter that makes pixels look smoother. Can be disabled, but I really liked it (steam store screenshots have it turned on).\n2. Added autosave of the last unlocked password. No need to write them down on a sheet of paper. Handy.\n3. Not only local, but also a network multiplayer (2 players coop campaign).\n\nNone of these features really make this game better or worser than it was before. I hightly recommend it to those who played this game years ago and liked it. It's still the very same fun game. On the other hand, mashing Fire is still a need as this way you shoot faster than if you just hold Fire key/button.\n\nFor those of you who didn't... Well, it's a good 2 players coop game, played good if using the same computer (keyboard or controller for each player). The game is of average difficulty. It can kill you really quick if you are careless, but not unbeatable and doesn't require super reaction or precision. No combos, dirty tricks, you can play it straight out of the box. A lot of guessing elements appear later in the game and make you life easier or harder depending on your choices. This game will not take much time, it has autosave every half an hour or an hour at later stages when you reach a new world.. or if you loose all your lives before that :D. If everything goes good, you'll be able to complete it in one go in somehting like 3-4 hours. Six different characters and different special power (unlocked later) give this game some replayability, but not too much. Finishing it 1-3 times will probably be enough for most players.\n\nIf this sounds fun - you should try it. If not - pass by, this game is quite good, but not a must see.","March 19, 2014","true","4.2"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","19","22","0","0"

I thought the Music was fantastic, very steampunk and in some parts intimidating, the gameplay was enjoyable and simple to understand, the characters were clever and well designed and the worlds were also very well designed. The story is easy to understand and plays well through the campaign. This re-release is about as good as it gets as far as The Chaos Engine is concerned, they have correctly identified the positives in the game, such as the Music, and amplified them to be better on newer systems, the controls are smooth and simple, as was the case back on the old Amiga, the achievements are entertaining and though there may be a small glitch when it comes to fully upgrading your character, I would strongly recommend this game to anybody out there who a) Wants a challenge, this game is tough as nails. b) Enjoys the typical run and gun style game. and c) Want a nostalgia trip.\n\nI have played the Co-op mode through Steam and it is alright, does take a while to adjust to the slight delays but soon it wears off and plays very well. Those of you who remember this game will know that the co-op mode was always difficult to follow and takes alot of practice, I regularly play the game with my borther over Steam and we do enjoy the challenge.\n\n10/10\n\nSteven Owen","October 21, 2014","true","73.9"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","18","22","0","0"

It's not exactly a remake, as the graphics haven't been redrawn and the presentation is pretty much exactly what it was twenty years ago. There are a few tweaks to the checkpointing system and control set-up, but, for better or worse, this is exactly the same game the critics raved about back in the early 1990s.While I found the experience too punishing, I'm sure there are longtime fans who have memorized every maze and can breeze through the entire game in a couple hours. Those gamers who grew up with The Chaos Engine will likely enjoy this more than I did. The developers haven't touched the graphics, which is something I appreciate. The music is also taken directly from the original Amiga CD release. For many European gamers, this will no doubt bring back a lot of fond memories.I wish I could share the love for this twenty year old game, but alas I couldn't get over the cheap deaths and unfair difficulty. It's filled with bits and pieces that I love and respect, but they never quite come together like they should. This enhanced version of The Chaos Engine could use a few more enhancements.With so many great ideas in The Chaos Engine, it pains me to admit that I didn't have much fun.

The Chaos Engine is a fantastic game that has a rock solid design, it is also one of the first games I ever played on the Amiga and was thrilled to see a remastered version released on Steam. Playing this again for the first time in about 18 years was the ultimate nostalgia trip. This game was way ahead of it's time, as was it's music.\n\nEven though the game is still hard as hell, that isn't an issue to me, it just makes me even more determined to try and beat it again. With the addition of online play, leaderboards and achievements, the Steam version of this game gives you more of a reason to keep coming back to have a go at it.\n\nThere are some small issues with this port however, none of which are truly game-breaking but can be annoying. The main issue is the co-op play. 9 times out of 10 the game play is extremely choppy and make it very difficult to play properly, I believe a patch was promised for this and I really hope it comes along soon.\nAnother thing that bothers me are some sound bugs that weren't present im the Amiga version. The sound of the the computer player teleporting to your location is elongated and high-pitched, it goes right through you now, especially after hearing it so frequently.  The theme after completing a level is also bugged and doesn't play properly, instead it just cuts straight to the menu music, not a big deal at all but it's just something I noticed. It could just be my memory, but I'm sure that the monsters use the wrong death and pain sounds too, I don't ever recall the monsters using the same sounds as the player characters.\n\nAll in all, this is a good port of a great game and I definitely recommend it to old and new fans alike. There are some small issues but it doesn't make it any less of a great game. If nothing else in this game does anything for you, play it just for the soundtrack.","September 24, 2014","true","32.0"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","0"

Once you get used to how Chaos Engine does stage layout - with lots of walls and stairs appearing or vanishing to create new paths - and get a better handle on positioning, distance and pacing, the game becomes a lot more manageable. But expect your first couple of runs to end in misery - it happens to everybody.\n\nThey made some changes to the game with this port but for the most part they are minimalistic and geared mainly towards making the game look and play better. The new save system let's you enjoy the game without having to punch in long passwords for one, but it won't help you cheat like an emulator would.\n\nPicking the Navvie (one of the six playable characters) makes things a little easier for beginners. His initial stats and powerful weapon makes him a very sturdy character, and his special is a no-nonsense smart-bomb. The other characters are more technical and require a little more knowledge of how the game works to use properly.\n\nPlaying online with a friend is an absolute blast, but the netcode is so-so.\n","January 6","true","1.8"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

Of my 100+ friends on here, 2 own it, and they never want to play it, so I've been unable to try it out regardless. I'd hope that when you do get in a match, it at least runs well, but considering how quickly the search results for the online matchmaking went from "player found" and then dropping back to the menu, to outright failing to find anyone, I doubt it.\n\nYou can stretch the window to fit your monitor, but that looks just as terrible as it sounds. You'll want to leave it in the native resolution, which, thankfully, is bearable. It's just amazing that they give you the option to change the resolution, when all it does is stretch the game window and make it look like a big square of mud. The supposed graphical filters that they include just make things look worse.\n\nI loathe this statement, but I am left to wonder if The Chaos Engine has been a victim of time. On it's own merits, just as a game, it simply isn't very good. Enemies are ruthless, and the characters all feel identical outside of their weapon and maximum health, despite the game adamantly stating they are very much unique in nature. I never saw a reason to play as anyone other than the high health characters as a result of this. If I was going to be dodging bullets all the time, I'd rather have a lot of chances to screw up than only a handful before my game ends.\n\nAfter each stage, you are able to increase your characters attributes. This should be awesome, but it is absolutely hamstrung but constantly having to babysit the other character. You already only make a handful of coins a level, but when playing solo, that amount is automatically cut in half, with half given to the AI. Because, you know, that's fair. So the most you can ever really do is buy an extra life for yourself, or maybe increase your maximum health. Those interesting, possibly viable upgrades like increased movement speed, firepower, and such? Don't even think about seeing them in action. Your little AI friend needs an extra life.\n\nWhen you are actually on the field playing this mess of a game, enemies spawn from generators much like in a Gauntlet title. In those games, everything was restricted to movement in the four cardinal directions.\n\nThe Chaos Engine hates you, so you are stuck moving and shooting in the four cardinal directions. Meanwhile, enemies can move wherever they damn well please, and some can shoot in 8 directions as well. Are you having fun yet?\n\nTo complete a stage, you have to shoot all the posts in the stage to open up the exit. There are unlisted hidden posts that can open up secret exits, but the game isn't enjoyable enough to make that an enticing idea in the slightest. When you finally complete a stage, you really just wish you would run out of lives already.\n\nLuckily for you, the game has some mercy. When you do run out of lives, there is no continue option. You just lose. You can "continue" from the main menu, but this just loads you at the start of the last stage you were on, in whatever horrible shape you were in before you got murdered. So that's great.\n\n\nWhy did I like this game when I was a kid?","December 31, 2013","false","1.5"," 20 of 34 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","20","34","0","4"

I found this game (I was playing it with my dad on Amiga a few years ago) and I thought it is a really nice gift for him. I saw that this game was not recommended by players but I thought that they just don't understand old games.\n\nI wasn't actually right. I had to purchase this game twice: for me and my dad. What we actually found (this version problems):\n- choosing champions (however I should call them) and purchasing upgrades just sucks, nothing changed since Amiga game and this is definietly not good idea for keyboards. It is so idiotic,\n- graphic didn't change. I mean I like it but I gave too much money to have the same thing what my dad actually has,\n- there should actually be some facilitations (other than saving game after each level) - no, it wouldn't be too easy because it is typical arcade game so pretty hard one,\n- nothing really interesting and innovating about in-game control.\n\nThis game is a huge mistake. Studio did an emulator just to gain money. It would be okay if this game costs 5-10 euro for you and your friend. I don't recommend this game right now. Maybe if it is a little bit (you know what actually "a little bit" means:) ) less.\n\nOf course if you want to play with me (I am going to finish this game anyway - I don't wanna waste that much money) - write to me.\n\nWatch videos, I think I'll record also The Chaos Engine soon. www.youtube.com/c/PearlyEu\n\nBye and see you soon in other reviews!\nRegards,\nPearly","August 25, 2015","false","4.8"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

So, naturally, when the game resurfaced a couple of decades later on Steam, I jumped at the chance to get stuck in once more.\n\nAt first glance, the game feels pretty close to the one I played in the 90s: the soundtrack is as great today as it was back then, and the gameplay has pretty much the same feel - right down to the Brigand ally always nipping in to steal the bounty from the enemies I just killed.\n\nHowever, there's something that just seems...off.\n\nSome of it could be put down to the resolution, as the options seem to boil down to having it look great in a small window or having it look ugly when blown up to full screen, and it isn't the rose-tinted spectacles telling me the game looked better in the 90s because watching a walkthrough on Youtube has the game looking better.

I have the Amiga original, which still holds up in spite of graphics and sound from 1993, largely due to its excellent gameplay. The Steam port (at least on PC) is nearly identical and therefore the same praise applies. If you like the original, you will like the port.\n\nI have one complaint, which for most people probably won't matter, but it is worth noting. Why did they have to go and mess with the original colors? I'm not talking about the hazards of trying to emulate Amiga hues on another system. Some colors in the game were deliberately changed, like the color of those little white cyclops guys with amber eyes (my avatar), whose white skin gave them a cool, creepy alien look. In the new version they are green with purple eyes, which makes them look more "cute" than creepy. They also seem to have brightened up the frogs too much, and the "mossy" gear backgrounds seem to have been changed to "rusty". More demerits! So far these are the only major, deliberate color changes I have noticed. Overall the colors are close enough, and admittedly, most people won't notice the hue changes or care.\n\nIf you have never played the original, don't be put off by the slightly-blocky-by-today's-standards graphics. The game is fun and addictive and definitely worth the ten bucks they are asking for the port.","January 17, 2014","true","0.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Sadly whatever idiots got the rights to remake this decided the old philosophy of "Make it as quick as possible, poop it out and make some cash" - it's why it's occasionally on sale for around $3 (which I highly reccomend waiting for if you're reading this and undecided about buying) as they've done a horrible job remaking this.\n\nFirst off, co-op doesn't work, or if it does with the few friends I have that own it it doesn't work and has never for them either, so if you're thinking about buying this for the "Co-op" fun it might have, unless you're going to play splitscreen or local coop you're likely not going to get to play with your friend.\n\n\nAnother slight issue I've found is that while on the controller movement can seem occasionally lagged, or even random; sure this may be because I'm using a 360 controller which has 8 different axis (compaired to the Sega Megadrive controller I used when originally playing this game back in the 90's - which only had 4) but that asde there still feels like the occasional bit of "random" or "undesired" movement is there, which in this game can be fatal.\n\n\nAll round it just feel like (as I've mentioned ^) that they jut threw it together, I'm no game developer so I've no idea how hard or difficult it may be to port a game from 1993 to todays computers but I'm sure someone out there could of done a much better job. Quite dissapointing as they've crapped all over a childhood favorite of mine.\n\n\nAlso the passwords are gone. Want to try and forgive them for messing up? Tough - apparently that wasn't something they thought important either.\n\n\n-- I'd like to point out the passwords aren't "gone" they're just not the original ones, I've no idea what they are although maybe I could Google them, but at this point I just don't care.","October 16, 2014","false","1.6"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","2"

I couldn't bear to play past the second level.\n\nThere are scarcely any options to toggle. Guns don't make any noise when you fire them. You can't mute the SFX or music separately-- you can't mute them at all in-game.\n\nProps for the password feature. Now, if I want to play with my friend on her computer, I can simply scribble down a password, walk next door, and drink until the idea leaves my head.\n\nI can't even play as a woman. You whisk me away to this fantasy land of dinosaurs, man-eating frogs and world-dominating computers, and you can't even be bothered to make one of the six generic shmucks a double-barrelled shotgun-toting mistress of murder? When did the creativity run out?\n\nYou NEED to have a second player on the field for some reason. No idea why, I can't think of any reason for it. If you're stuck with a COM, their character will have access to the "wisdom" trait, which decides how well their AI performs. Don't ask me what difference levelling that up will make, I don't know.

The offline play remains pretty true to the SNES version, but the special power button seems sort of bugged out. I was playing with a 360 controller and it get mapped by default to the L trigger, which seems to be sort of wonky. Luckily you can remap the controls, but it still seems sort of sticky to use. Movement and regular firing are about the same as SNES.\n\nOther bugs include leaderboards showing The Priest in lieu of some other characters. I was doing a play with the Thug/Brigand and the leaderboard shows Thug/Priest, for example.\n\nThe enhanced graphics are ok, but not that great. It looks like a photoshop smooth filter was applied to the character models (the map seems the same?) and a bit shinier of explosions, but that's about it. You can switch between either graphics instantly while in game, though, which is nice. There's a nice "how-to" menu that explains the formerly bamboozling upgrade system and explains the powerups nicely.\n\nI wouldn't really recommend this game at its fullest price point unless you're a bizarrely huge fan of the original game(s).

First of all a dinosaur is found trapped in rock just south of Berkshire. However, when examined it appears that it's a lifeform not known to man. At the same time a theatre in Paris suddenly disappears into the earth, the Statue of Liberty crashes into the heart of New York destroying everything in its path, and half the population of Bavaria are turned into wolves, stalking the countryside for innocent victims.\n\nCentral to these strange happenings, Great Britain descends into anarchy as the landscape begins to alter and change disturbingly. Unknown to everyone the source of the disturbances is coming from the south of Cornwall where Baron Fortesque, bored of making pasties and fighting off Spanish trawlers, has decided to build a massive steam-driven engine with the power to transform matter. It grows out of control andt he Baron becomes imprisoned within the engine, transforming him into a deformed creature of evil. Now fueling itself, the Chaos Engine continues to inflict its evil curse on the world.\n\nTwo brave soldiers (the game can be played co-operatively) must enter the grounds of the mansion and make their way to the resting-place of the dreaded engine - The Hall of Machines. Stepping forward for the task are six unique individuals: the Mercenary, the Brigand, the Gentleman, the Navvie, the Thug and the Priest. Picking the right two men for the job is essential if you're going to have any chance of getting near the evil device.\n\nEach character has different statistics covering speed, skill, intelligence, strength, health and weaponry and it really does matter who you choose as if you pick a strong yet stupid computer-controlled partner in single player they may well stand around while you are getting shot to pieces (though picking a weak yet smart character may leave you with too little firepower and thus end up with you getting shot to pieces also).\n\nWhoever you choose, you must then fight your way through four worlds, split into four individual levels in order to achieve your goal. Viewed from a top-down perspective, the title takes a somewhat unique approach to the standard shooter. While action consists of going around blasting anything and everything that moves, there is a subtle strategy at work in the game mechanic. As well as blasting there are endless puzzles to solve, some of which are incredibly tricky to work out. Solving puzzles leads you to secret areas or even to a different exit from the level.\n\nIn order to leave the current level a set number of nodes must be activated in order to activate the exit door. Doing this is easier said than done as you are usually surrounded by all manner of nasty creatures. This fills the game with an incredibly intense atmosphere that is built up in equal measure by the bleak graphical style and the outstanding industrial-tinged techno soundtrack. Graphics are fairly simple but contain subtle elements of detail that make you believe you're making your way through a truly disturbing place; this coupled with a dark and menacing colour palette is incredibly effective in creating the chaos-themed world that the title is set in.\n\nSomething else that Elevates the game to the next level is the outstanding soundtrack. One of the most potently powerful musical creations in the history of gaming, the soundtrack beautifully accompanies the action with its continually brooding and sinister nature, hinting that you are only scratching the surface of evil and at any minute the true horror is about to greet you. Simply stunning.\n\nIn terms of how the game actually plays, we are presented with a strange juxtaposition of styles. Although you are constantly under threat from numerous nasty creatures that all need blasting to bits, the game has a somewhat structured pace to it. Far from the breakneck speed of other top-down shooters such as Smash T.V., The Chaos Engine makes you think more carefully about what you should be doing, Go aimlessly wading in with all guns blazing and you will die, simple as that. Instead, players need to stand back from time to time and think how best to deal with the creatures. This is mainly because certain creatures take forever to kill so you need to make sure they are going to be dead before they reach you. Also, you cannot move and shoot at the same time, so you have to move up the screen then stop in order to pick off enemies (bringing even more strategy to proceedings).\n\nThere have been some improvments made, such as the smoothing of graphics and getting the game to understand a proper 360 degree axis to allow for better movement and shooting with control pads and analogue sticks. However, this is effectively the same game as before - it's now just a bit more friendly for modern PC's. It feels old school and a touch dated but the strenght of the game is such that is remains something worth playing.Perhaps more could ahve been done but at least it can't be accused of ruining the atmosphere or feel of the game.\n\nThe Chaos Engine is one of the most original and inventive shooting games that has ever graced the planet. With a difficulty setting that starts at hard and goes to ridiculous, it's a very rare thing to meet someone who has made it all the way to the end. Regardless, it's a genuinely exciting experience and any true fan of either retro gaming or shooters should have this title in their collection. It is a strategy-tinged, puzzle-filled, full-on, adrenaline-pumping ambient shooter, and you need it, but it might seem a touch slower than you remember.\n\n8/10","February 4, 2014","true","1.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Bonus and redeeming feature is multiplayer over network.\nThis is indeed a solid rewrite of an old classic and it is true to it's origin, really f****ng hard. If you can't handle that, save your hardware the beating and your neighboors the loud profanities by opting out. If you like a proper challenge and have masochistic tendencies, give it a spin. Or, if you have sadistic tendencies, buy a 4-pack and punish your Sims-playing friends with a taste of the old world.\n\nScore:\n4/5","February 12, 2014","true","0.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Don't get me wrong, there was a hell of a lot of blasting, it was just never quite a cakewalk...unlike some other games of the time. This is a fairly faithful port or "Remake" to modern PC, and it's a damn fine one in my opinion.\n\nIt is a fairly straightforward top down 2 player co-op shooter, with several characters to choose from and a system that adds stat boosts puchased with money collected in-game. This gives the game a little more depth in my opinion. Also, if you have no mates...the other player is controlled by a fairly robust AI. The music is fantastic and the artwork is 2nd to none when it comes to 16-bit games, the whole game oozes atmosphere and it won't be afraid to kick your â¥â¥â¥ while you are sitting taking it all in!\n\nThe game has taken flak for just being the same game re-released on modern systems and yeah, that's what it is. There is nice upscaling, added bloom effects if you are into that sort of thing and there is some improved aiming if you don't want the exact original gameplay...though that is there for you too if you prefer that. A lot of the heat has been similar to the Speedball 2 HD release, a lot of angry nostalgiac Amiga users screaming about how the original is better. I love the original versions too but i quite like these updated releases and welcome them with open arms.\n\nWell worth the cash if you can find a mate that ain't afraid of a bit of punishment.","August 25, 2014","true","2.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Â¥10","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cuttingagent/","164 products in account","I knew this was less a 'remake/remaster' than a completely unenhanced port going into it, but out of curiosity I bought it on sale very cheap  anyway, and you know what? I was STILL disappointed. This port is as bare-bones as it gets, for all the options the game gives you, you'll be looking for a quarter slot.\n\nThe in-game manual is ugly as sin and clashes with the core design aesthetic.\n\nThere's no reason for this port to exist besides accessibility. If you don't have an Amiga lying around, just play the SNES or Genesis version on console or emulator. There's simply no way to recommend anyone spend money on this, sorry BMP Bros.\n\nBy the way if you're looking for the 'Enhanced mode', it's just a smoothing filter and bloom effect. But of course the info page and every prerealease blurb online mentions it as if it's an actual thing that exists.\n\nThe game does have online co-op--if you can find anyone to play it with...\n\nThis is a fun game and had it been released *as a port and not a remake* I'd have no complaints at all. Maybe if you think of it the same way you won't feel cheated if you buy it. They did add 16-way aiming for analog controllrs which I could take or leave. The game is obviously designed for 8-way and 16-way technically makes it easier. therefore debalanced, but other than that I'm sure OG Chaos Engine fans will find exactly what they're looking for. But I still suggest to just play one of the other versions unless you really want the online play. With that said, this is still a cool game and it's not as if anyone who buys it would be stuck with a worthless piece of software that's just going to sit in your account collecting virtual dust. I think it should be cheaper though, for sure, like maybe 6 dollars tops.","January 4, 2014","false","1.9"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Of the three classic versions, the Amiga CD32 version had the best graphics and sound while the consoles had much snappier loading times. With the Steam version, you not only get the Amiga version of the graphics (more advanced color palette and animation detail) and sound, you also get the incredibly fast loading times.\n\nAlso, the Steam version comes with achievements, cards, matchmaking and some image enhancement options. I highly recommend playing this game at the original, intended resolution. Scaling it up to "HD" will only blow up the pixels to a size that is nearly unbearable to look at. However, if kept at the original size, one can really appreciate the exquisite pixel art of the Bitmap Brothers. Smoothing can enhance the visuals even more, but, again, it is best left at the original resolution.  As for the added bloom effects, they are successful at enhancing the already impressive original explosion animations and other elements of the game world. I would put this game on a list of examples of games that use bloom to great effect without overdoing it.\n\nMy review is really focused on whether or not this is a good port. If you're unfamiliar with the Chaos Engine, I recommend checking out some of the other reviews here to find out if its your kind of game.\n\nyogen","October 7, 2014","true","1.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

So I got it on sale and it's actually great! It has the opion of playing in fullscreen/widescreen, smooth or sharp pixel graphics (but the smooth option looks bad and seems to slow down the gameplay), with a Bloom affect.\n\nThis is just how I remember it from when I played this as a kid - though I can get a bit further than I did when I was younger. And what makes this shoot'em up even more fun is the ability to level up your character, as well as your computer partner's character. And each character has their own characteristics which affects gameplay.\n\nIt's hard and there are lots of secrets to uncover. The soundtrack is also pretty cool. It's well worth the full price. With lots levelling up to do and secrets to find, this classic shooter will keep you coming back for more fast-paced blaster mayhem.","October 14, 2014","true","2.4"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

A Bitmap Brothers must buy along with speedball2.\nMore please.
