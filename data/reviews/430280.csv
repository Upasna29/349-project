I will keep playing to see if it gets any better.  I like the anti-deforrestation theme but some of these animals don't even live in the environment they're protecting.  That's a minor nitpick though.","December 23, 2015","false","2.5"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","17","20","2","1"

My friend decided to be generous and get me some games for Christmas. Little did I know, it was going to be a combination of furries and cancer. This game requires ZERO strategic knowledge or adaptability, and the English localization is downright awful. The music makes my ears bleed, and the graphics are like Super Metroid on crack.\n\nP.S. WHY THE HELL DOES THE GAME REQUIRE 8 GIGS OF RAM TO BE PLAYED?!\n\nThanks, Fesh God. You ♥♥♥♥ing monster.","December 28, 2015","false","0.3"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","68","13","19","11","2"

The game its fun, and for the price it’s a bargain. BTW I really hate the shotgun guys! And the Armadillos are my favorite characters. Another nice touch is that the economy is not like in PvsZ where you set OP units and you’re done. Here strategy it’s a big deal. I recommend it.","December 25, 2015","true","10.5"," 2 of 14 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","2","14","0","0"
