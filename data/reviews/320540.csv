"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cerebralpulse/recommended/320540/","cerebralpulse","Mio","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cerebralpulse/","3110 products in account","[EDIT: Game has been released out of Early Access, this is my updated review, having played a few more hours, you can read the OLD REVIEW below this]\n\nSo, has my opinion changed at all? Short answer, no it hasn't; and here's why:\n1. The Story is still the same length, so the game is still no longer than it was when I originally played it. Added acheivements is nice, but it's as though the devs added those just so you would play longer, and overlook the brevity of the game.\n2. They have added a new mode - some Grandpa mode that I can't think of the name of (and the devs haven't even added this in their blurb about the game contents) - where you have to race around the map to collect items within a certainn time, with each item adding a small amount of time. That was fun, for all of about 10 minutes. *The devs have the potential to expand on this with all sorts of modes, but for me, it's too late now.*\n3. I tried MULTIPLAYER for all of you guys out there, but here's the problem: it's dead. So, that's as far as I got - an empty lobby. I waited a good 10 mins waiting for players. Nothing.\n\nFinal Conclusion: more acheivements and an extra-limited gamemode, couple with dead multiplayer, makes this otherwise "had heaps of potential" game a major disappointment. Definitely still don't recommend the game at the price it is, because, while it is quite polished, it's more of a thin veneer over a mostly empty shell. I won't rate it, but I will give you a personal value of the game: $3. This is based not on how much time and effort the devs put into the game, but the bottom line of how many hours one would probably spend on the game to get most of the acheivements: ~3hrs (and that's playing story mode about THREE times, talk about tedious).\n\n[End of updated review]\n\nTL/DR: "A pretty fun game with lots of potential to be great if A LOT more content is added."\n\nCurently what this game does is grab the elements of good kart games, adds a bit of it's own feel to it, and leaves you with a empty shell of a game. I say this because when I jumped into this game I expected a solid single-player game. What I got was less than 2 hours of gameplay - and it would have been much less than that had I not bothered so hard to upgrade my kart so early on, by repeating a few races. So let's break it down a bit, be a bit more constructive with our bashing of a game that has so much potential to be a good game.\n\nPros:\nGraphically, it's nice to look at - looks a lot like F1 Racestars or Costume Quest - simple, clean and easy on the eyes.\nSounds are also simple - didn't notice any annoying repetitiveness blaring away in my ears, it's all pretty good.\nGameplay is solid. Heck, these three points should make for a great game!But, the Cons:\nStory mode is super short. I reckon it would take me, if I could be bothered, just over an hour each to use each of the 7 characters in story mode. But really, WHY would I bother? I didn't see any other single-player modes, apart from re-hashing the story - Open World Practice and Time Trials anyone?\nWow, major OP karts once you have even half upgraded them. Made the 2nd half of the story mode too easy\nI didn't play this for multiplayer. Maybe one day I'll play split screen, but even then it's limited to 12 tracks (plus 1?)\nIn conclusion, this game had me torn - it has so much potential (did I say that already?) But with the lack of SP content alone, I cannot recommend this game anywhere near the price it is.\nIf the devs overhaul the SP into something a LOT bigger - even with a 1/5 of the content of Sonic/Mario/F1Racestars/GasGuzzlers, then maybe we have a game on our hands. As it is, it just doesn't have enough going for it, the devs have a solid base, but they need to get out of the basement, and make this an apartment block. Till then I cannot recommend. Let's hope the devs read some of these reviews and act positively :)","April 14, 2015","false","6.7"," 137 of 179 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","137","179","3","17"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/320540/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2816 products in account","This game was reviewed using a code sent by the developer.\nCoffin Dodgers is a kart racing type game that was released in July 2015 developed by Milky Tea Studios.\n\nThe gameplay in Coffin Dodgers is something which I found to be something of a strange one. The actual kart racing looks to be really fun from the screenshots and video trailer, but when you get into the game, it is just infuriating. I have played my fair share of kart racing games, and you expect to be screwed over at times by the rest of the players, but it is beyond a joke in this game. It is almost like you are better off being in last place until the last five seconds of the race because if you are anywhere near first place, you WILL get gimped on, and when you do, you will go right back down to last place due to the amount of people that will be aiming straight up your backside with rockets.  People may think I am just ratting on the game because I am bad at it, you may think that, but I actually finished the game fairly quickly and on the harder difficulties. I then tried it on the lower settings and it is exactly the same; completely unfair advantage that the AI has over the player.\n\nAs with all other kart games, there are power ups for you to collect as you race; these consist of rockets, Uzis, speed boosts, defibrillators (these act as an area effect stun), shields, and oil puddles. On top of these power ups, you are able to upgrade your kart in the garage by using the gold you earn from taking part in the races. Quick tip, don't upgrade anything unless you can afford the highest upgrade for your engine, everything else is just pointless on the single player. You can upgrade things such as how well your kart handles, how many power ups you may carry at any one time, or how much damage you do to the other riders.  For me the gameplay is really a level below all other kart games out there at the moment and I was a little disappointed with it.\n\nGraphically, Coffin Dogers is actually a really aesthetically pleasing game. It has the cartoon art style which looks like it’s come straight out of Simpsons or Family Guy and it actually fits in well with the theme,  the game does not take it self seriously at all. The graphics side of the game do actually redeem itself a bit here.\n\nLike I said above, this is a pretty difficult game to play on single player - the AI clearly has an unfair advantage over the player and it shows on a nearly minute basis as you get blown up time and time again. The game has varying levels of difficulty but even then, the easy settings still punish the player phenomenally.\n\nCoffin Dodgers actually has a fair amount of replay ability in it - the single player story/campaign mode took me about four hours to complete, there are about 5 stages, and each stage has 3 sub racers for you to take part in, you do however really need to be winning every race for you to get the biggest gold reward at the end of it all allowing you to upgrade your kart in order to keep up with the rest of the pack. Where I got the most enjoyment and playability was in the game's local multiplayer function. The game allows split screen up to four people and it does it really well. Being able to play with your friends on the couch for a few racers is really where this game shines - my friends and me have played this game for about five hours just on the multiplayer split screen. You don't mind getting shot in the back when you are playing with friends, since you can all have a joke about it, it is a bit different when it’s the AI though...\n\nAll of the race locations are really well designed. Granted one or two are the same map but just done in a reverse direction, but there is a nice amount of shortcuts you can find in order to get a slight advantage over anyone else. Whilst there are a small amount of locations where you can pick up the power ups, it would make it a lot more hectic if there were a few more points to get them from. Some of the levels are quite large and you can be going quite a while before running into the next power up at points.\n\nI did have a few technical problems with Coffin Dodgers sadly; firstly, the game does not work with the Steam controller at all, but has no problems with the Xbox controller. I wouldn't recommend playing the game with a keyboard, it'll just get messy.  I also noticed a few bugs in the game too; for instance, there are a few power up strips located throughout some of the maps, it seems as if these do the exact opposite if you ride over them - you get a bit of a stuttering effect when using them, so it got to the point where I needed to avoid these all together. I also had this same problem when going up any sort of ramp, you'll be slowed down to the point where you are almost stationary, but your opponents do not get the problem.\n\nThe last problem I had was a bit of a strange one. Even though my frame rate counters were all showing me at 60+ FPS, the gameplay still seemed to look as if it was being run at 30 fps. I couldn't work out what was causing it, but it did eventually sort itself out with no interaction by me. The game can also be run at 4k resolutions which is a nice plus too.\n\nIn conclusion, I am not going to recommend Coffin Dodgers, purely because the gameplay is really not good. There are better kart racing games out there. The only enjoyment I got out of the game was the local multiplayer, but I wouldn't recommend it just on that.  If you are into the kart racing genre, you may want to check it out, but even then, I think £8, 99 is a bit much.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Official_KwS/recommended/320540/","Official_KwS","KidwithSmurf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Official_KwS/","827 products in account","Coffin Dodgers is one of the better Mario Kart, Crash Tag Team Racing/Nitro Kart style clones made for PC but with that said I still can not recommend this game. It is fun for a while then becomes really repetitive and annoying and is full of things that I'd have expected to be smoothed out better. With that said, I'll list my pros and cons below.\n\nPros:\n♦ Great funny/quirky game concept (What's better than old people on mobility scooters whacking people with walking sticks?)\n♦ Great number of character skins (They are only skins as each character doesn't do anything unique from the other)\n♦ Awesome initial storyline (See cons for why I say initial)\n♦ Amazing artwork/graphics\n♦ Nice number of modes\n♦ Customizable controls that work\n♦ Good integration of controller and keyboard\n♦ Maps look stunning\n♦ Helpful Tutorial\n\nCons:\n♦ Different Characters don't give a uniqueness to the game (This is annoying as there is no point playing one character over another as they are only skins and give no ingame unique difference such as special weapon or vehicle attribute etc)\n♦ Hardly any campaign content (Only 15 races which took me around 2-3hours to complete)\n♦ No Brakes (Pressing S instantly reverses which makes it really hard to slow down)\n♦ Can hit someone and instantly get knocked off (This is annoying as you just have to tap someone and they can knock you off)\n♦ Almost impossible to quickly/easily get unstuck on corners when stuck behind obsticles such as light posts and hay bails (Trying to get unstuck takes ages and hitting one can put you in eighth indefinitely no matter your current position)\n♦ The ending storyline was terrible (Just seems to show a short scene with Grim and then randomly saying "The End". Could have been written way better)\n♦ Voice Actors would have made it cooler\n♦ XP gained seems 100% Pointless\n♦ Can't replay a Campaign Level when you hit continue after finishing it (This is 100% stupid as an achievement is get gold on all levels and thus if you didn't get gold on your first play through, you have to keep re-trying until you do and if you accidentally hit continue, you can't go back. This is also annoying for replay value as you have to start a new campaign to replay levels).\n♦ Multiplayer is laggy or unbalanced compared to campaign/single player (I was playing with 2 people online and the rest AI and I couldn't seem to get out of 8th place in both races I did whereas in single player, I almost always placed in the top 3 which didn't add up as I should've been vsing the same AI as in single player)\n♦ Multiplayer Vehicle Upgrade Shop seemed Broken (I purchased all the upgrades in Campaign and went to Multiplayer and had to re-buy them. So I did this and yet it still wouldn't let me use them in Multiplayer. If upgrades don't work in Multiplayer, why have the option to buy them?)\n♦ Multiplayer got stuck on loading track level (I Alt+Tabbed whilst the level loaded and came back and it just kept showing the track preview and I could hit escape or do anything, I'm not sure if someone quit before it had loaded but it was 100% stuck spinning on track preview)\n♦ No voice chat for Multiplayer (This would make it more fun)\n♦ Alt+Tab seems to causes errors sometimes (Once the game crashed saying it couldn't load graphics and the second error I got was sound glitched until I died, which was annoying)\n♦ Achievements seem like an after thought (There are some nice achievements and some that are just silly try-hard to make you play the game just to get them, like win multiplayer every day of the week or on special days etc and the fact you can't replay campaign levels to gold them if you didn't without starting a new campaign to get the gold all level achievements is stupid)\n♦ No way to quit multiplayer when I joined matchmaking (Found players and after each race, it just threw me back into another race and seemingly the only way to quit multiplayer was to quit the race once the race had to started. This is bad as quitting during a race ruins your rating).\n♦ Can't restart a campaign race whilst in that race (This is 100% stupid as if you know you're not going to get 1st, 2nd or 3rd you can't restart and either have to quit back to main menu or finish the 4 laps to restart the race... which is way time consumer and annoying).\n\nOverall, Coffin Dodgers isn't a terrible game and is one of the best Mario Kart/Crash Tag Team Racing/Nitro Kart clones for PC I've seen in a long time. However, unfortunetly there are more cons than pro's meaning I can't recommend this game in it's current state. If there was more campaign content with a story that had so much potential not just randomly ending, you could actually break so you crashed less, could get out of stuck situations easier/quicker so you didn't definitely come last everytime you crash and didn't reverse every time you wanted to slow down and if multiplayer was less buggy/glitchy/laggy it would be a 100% game.","September 27, 2015","false","3.2"," 45 of 58 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","45","58","2","9"

The town’s seniors decide that the best way to sort out who gets to live and who dies is by having a racing event where the losers are quietly swooped away by the Reaper, while the winners get to live…at least a little bit longer.\n\nAfter choosing to play as one of a handful of seniors, players partake in races that take place in the town and surrounding countryside. Powerups litter the track, giving players the ability to, among other things, shoot submachine guns, rockets, or create oil slicks that slow down the other racers. Melee attacks can also be used to disrupt other racers, though these attacks obviously require close proximity to opponents.\nUpgrades can be purchased using the rewards from the races, and players have the ability to customize their scooter to their heart’s content.\n\nAs is the case with these types of racers, they’re much more fun playing with a group of friends, than playing solo. The single-player experience is good fun, but racing against A.I. only entertains me for so long. The game’s multiplayer experience is a virtual ghost town, though, so I was unable to find a multiplayer match to join in on. Fortunately, local multiplayer options ensure that if you live with friends or host frequent parties, you’ll all be able to jump right into Coffin Dodgers for some silly racing experiences.\n\nA ghost town of a multiplayer community isn’t uncommon for small-scale PC games. Luckily, Coffin Dodgers is a pretty fun game on its own, and I imagine is great fun to play with others through local multiplayer.","March 14","true","17.3"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","18","21","0","2"

It's a mario-kart clone with no reverse fire and non-interesting items. There's no defense beyond a shield item. You can get beat to death on the finish line, lap 4, in first place, and finish last.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/320540/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3342 products in account","The kart racing genre was a staple of the 32-bit era. Every possible franchise you could imagine had an entry — even Mega Man and Final Fantasy. Some of these wound up being highly-forgettable due to their mediocrity, while top-shelf entries like Mario Kart 64 and Crash Team Racing raised the bar for the genre. Due to the glut of games, however, a lot of these franchises just had one and done entries and the genre wound up being downgraded in terms of the quantity of games, but increased in quality. The Mario Kart games kept things going, as did a scattered assortment of other games like Crash Nitro Kart while Sonic and Sega’s All-Star Racing franchise remains the third-party gold standard now.\n\nWith the console-centric entries in the genre keeping quality high, it’s led to an influx of kart racers on mobile platforms. Some have just been mobile variants on console games, like All-Star Racing Transformed, while others have gone with a 3D look like Shrek’s kart racer. The 3D games tend to look rather ugly and don’t do much to freshen things up. While Coffin Dodgers isn’t a pretty game and sadly continues that trend, it does freshen the genre up a bit with a unique premise.The Grim Reaper is coming for a slew of old people and it’s to whichever character you choose to play as to save the day for themselves.\n\nWins and losses actually have a sense of importance in the championship campaign since whoever comes in last place winds up dying. This means that they can’t make any progress in the story, but Death will revive them to get in your way. In a neat bit, Death actually takes part in the races too. I guess he’s really hands-on and wants to make sure that he takes care of all these codgers himself to at least try and ensure his job is done properly. Luckily, Death can be thwarted here thanks to some power-ups and your default melee attack. The control layout works fine and everything is responsive — not razor-sharp like Mario Kart 8, but still reasonably good.\n\nStandard kart racing rules apply for the main game with the basic goal being to score in the top three to ensure progression throughout each set of championship-level races. The better you do in the standings and on the track, the easier time you’ll have making progress. Proper weapon use nets you a ton of XP, while wins get you cash. Cash allows you to upgrade your mobility scooter in a variety of ways. If you’re not happy with its handling, just focus on mobility upgrades.\n\nUnlike a lot of kart racers that let you re-race tracks to get the best score, you can’t quite do that here. You’re free to retry as much as you want to right after a race, but can’t go through an earlier course with new gear to try and gain more money. It’s a bit of a shame, but it does allow things to be a bit more fair and not make any single player a demigod in the lineup. The game’s use of rubber banding is annoying, and can easily send you from first into the back of the pack with either a single mistake that sends you into the scenery or a weapon blast.\n\nThe core game offers up a lot of fun with a combination of a melee attack that can be charged up to do tons of damage in one shot and the usual array of power-ups. The combat evokes a bit of Road Rash by offering up some satisfying bonks to the head during a close race. Item pickups are fairly standard, with a boost, rockets, and homing rockets available. The biggest change is the inclusion of a sub-machine gun, which you certainly wouldn’t expect in a game like this.\n\nVisually, Coffin Dodgers looks like a fairly old mobile game. Nothing about the graphics is all that eye-pleasing, and to say that they’re on-par with the PS2 would be an insult to the beauty showcased during that generation. The character models are simplistic, as are the environments and animations. The most impressive part of the graphics probably lies in the explosions from the rockets — and even those aren’t all that amazing, they’re just the best-looking things in an otherwise bad-looking game. Animations are nearly non-existent and every part of the world looks like a paint-by-numbers design. It’s a sloppy-looking game in every way.\n\nThe audio is worse than the visuals because at least there’s some variety there. Musically, you get very few tracks to listen to and they’re short and loop constantly. Sound effects are okay, but forgettable due to being bog-standard with what you’d expect. You get a basic thwack sound for melee, braking, acceleration, and power-up weapons like rockets. You can just imagine them and that’s what you’d hear — the game loses nothing being muted, and that’s never good. Sound design is such a crucial part of the puzzle and it’s just been forgotten here.\n\nCoffin Dodgers is a heavily flawed game that winds up being ever-so-slightly greater than the sum of its parts. On the surface, it shouldn’t be as fun as it is due how rough around the edges so many parts of it are. The core game is still fun to play even with its issues, though. The options are somewhat limited for PC kart racers and this one does have enough going for it gameplay-wise to be satisfying. Its graphics and sound fall far short of any standard set in the past 15 years, however, and it looks far sloppier than any kart racer we’ve seen on the market in many years. As a result, Coffin Dodgers comes with a very mild recommendation if you’ve played through every other kart racer out there and just want something to dink around with for a bit.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/320540/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","I've eyed this game for a while as I've seen it on sale once or twice, but finally decided to give it a go when I felt the price was right. Felt like it was worth the purchase, but even so, it bugs me that there is no one online to play with after beating a mid-ranged story mode.\n\nCoffin Dodgers feels like Mario Kart met up with Road Redemption while introducing it all with an interesting story line to say the least. The game is good, but it feels like it could have been a lot better with a few tweaks. Death one day decides to show up to the little town where there are numerous old folks. One by one, they will be taken away if they do not succeed in placing first in the race.\n\nThe game itself is enjoyable. In fact, the game feels quite right as no shortcuts or glitches seem to prop up. When I first started playing, the driving scheme didn't sit too well. It felt like Mario Kart turning initially but ended up as Sonic All Star Racing drift feel. I was slightly confused in knowing how much was too much going into a turn when it came to smashing the gas. After a bit of time, I familiarized myself with their control scheme and actually find it enjoyable. You can get through a track without using the brake by letting off on the gas to make sharp turns. There are times you will need to quickly let go, tap the brake, and hit the gas quickly to keep your head out in first. The carts you drive in themselves were also up for question before I bought this game. I figured how fast could one really go and make a scooter fun to drive. They, however, made it so. Besides the driving feeling right, they added power-ups within the game. Upgrading your scooter can allow you to hold two power-ups simultaneously as well change it's color and engine specification.\n\nPower-ups come in many forms such as rockets, boosters, mac-10 automated pistol, and even oil slicks. My power of choice in this game is the ability to whack your opponents with your cane at any given moment. This is one of the great features in this game that many other games as Mario Kart lacks. I like games that consistently keep you on your toes, engaged, and force you to pay attention at all times. At any point of a race, you are able to charge up how hard you want to hit someone and are able to release that charge right through your cane into another racers face. Just because you don't have a power-up, doesn't mean you won't get knocked off your scooter/kart. In this sense, it follows Road Redemption but adds the extra umph once a power-up is picked up. This feature alone can make it worth while, and as seen in RR, can make the whole game. After each race, you are rewarded with coins and experience. There was an excellent balance between grinding for cash and earning rewards. Throughout the race, there may be random obstacles within the way or ways to get more XP or coins. A cop car or a regular car may come driving through, a pedestrian may be crossing, or zombies might be in the way. I also have to give the game huge props for doing multi/local player battle race extremely enjoyable and simple to access.\n\nGraphics are absolutely appropriate for what they did. It feels like N64 graphics but with a 2015 update/mod/patch/fix to it. I love the sounds and the ambiance provided within the game. You will see your old timer as they are cruising through the map looking around and observing what's going on. It's small details like this that make games noticeable (but it's the big details like game play that make up a game)!\n\nThough albeit the game for the most part is good, it could have been a lot better. Besides having one melee attack, why not add two? Or a variation to the swing? Small things like this take the game from simply having an ability, to extending the power of this ability that effects the entire game. It also gives me a different method of attack. I would have also liked to see different game modes. Sumo, battle, or maybe a mode to see who could blow up or whack the most zombies.\n\nBecause it is missing a little, but because it does have local, I think it's a well rounded score deserving a\n\nIndie RATING : 7.8/10\n\nStandalone RATING : 7.0/10\n\nI would highly recommend playing this with friends as it's difficult to find people online. Also, for any future updates or DLC's to the game I would recommend a longer storyline with a bit more whackyness to the tracks. Towards the end (and especially the final track), things finally got overly creative that it was starting to become really fun to play. Playing a bit of local co-op I've noticed some players spend a lot of time on the floor. I noticed myself on story mode that I'd be licking pavement. I would make it slightly more of a challenge to knock someone off their scooter.\n\n\nScreenShots :\nThe longer you hold the button down, the greater the charge you get\n\nJust missed\n\nThe weapons are as fun and as whacky as the game is\n\nIf you get hit hard enough or hit a wall at the wrong angle, expect to go flying\n\nYou will encounter random obstacles throughout the races\n\nCharacter selection screen\n\nSome clipping going on in two player.

FalczPwnzYa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/falczpwnzya/","555 products in account","TL;DR Good potential and features, but the game is too damn hard.\n\nTrying to find a good cart game on PC is really hard. This game is probably one of the best I have played, however its plagued with small things which are infuriating.\n\nThe AI has zero rubberbanding that I have observed, if you get to last place during a race, its extremely unlikely you will be able to catch up. I'm not saying racing games need rubberbanding, but for this type of arcade racing, it would be nice.\n\nThe maps are unforgiving. Scattered all around the levels are objects on the sides. The AI never hit them, but if you do, you instantly stop, and are required to reverse to get around them. This can take you from 1st place, to an unrecoverable last place. The walls are sticky, if you tap or grind into them slightly in some places, you completely stop and get stuck, other times you just bounce off.\n\nUpgrade system is too expensive. You can't replay levels to earn more money, modes other than story don't earn you money. You can buy paint for your cart... WHO would buy this?? Theres not enough money to upgrade the essentials let alone deciding to paint your cart.\n\nWeapons, seem inconsistant. Sometimes they work, other times they don't. e.g missles in a straight line sometimes miss the AI players. AI don't seem to have this issue when shooting you.\n\nPowerups are useless. The 'boost' doesn't seem to do anything, sure if makes you look like you are going faster, but AI have passed me while I've been 'boosting', and I rarely catch up to AI when using the boost.\n\nThe game has really good potential, but these issues need to be ironed out before its actually enjoyable.

ISN'T considered an insult!\n\nAs a fairly new game and with such limited reviews, I thought I would add to them and tell you guys what I think.\n\nCoffin Dodgers is PC players answer to a multiplayer "Mario Kart 8" type game. I've always thought a game like this would be so much fun on steam, and I was right! It is!\n\nNow I can go around in a hot pink leotard hitting old people with my walker. 10/10.\n\n- Play as your choice of grammie or grandpa\n- Unique scooters to each character\n- Battle Royale type campaign story mode, if you are in the bottom you are sacrificed to the grim reaper. Only way to win is to be at the top.\n- Colorful and beautiful art style and graphics.\n- Upgrades on your cart through coin progression based on how well you do in the matches.\n- Play story mode, time trails, open world, and soon multiplayer racing.\n- Challenging maps and AI's. You will crash. A lot.\n\nCurrent downsides:\n\n- No Multiplayer support added as of now. Devs have said it will be updated within the next 2-3 months at which time they will be out of EA.\n- Being that it is EA, there are some bugs and glitches.\n- Campaign mode is missing the final level. It's not complete.\n\nWith such a short estimate for these things being updated, I don't feel it's enough to not try out the game and give them some early support until they do finish it.\n\nThings I would like to see:\n\n- Character customization! Would be neat to play dress up and unlock different props, clothes, hair styles, or even more carts or colors/designs on them.\n- VOIP. For this to be a contender in one of the best casual party racing games, it needs the ability to communicate in voice!\n- More maps, and more characters. (Specifically females! Only 2 to choose from in current build.)\n- Implement more cart customizations like the newest mk8 such as gliding.\n- More power ups to choose from! (And an option to drop power ups if we don't want them right now. *coughs* machine gun that you have to shoot a million bullets to get rid of)\n\nBut yeah, really fun game! I will be eagerly watching the development of this game and know when multiplayer comes out it will be a hit.","March 12, 2015","true","4.1"," 32 of 59 people (54%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","54","32","59","5","0"

Other than a few funky aspects of the games physics (Getting stuck on objects or crashing you car randomly), its pretty smooth and balanced. The game is very short and offers a very basic couch co-op racer. Other than that there's nothing really to add.\n\nIt acts as a place-holder for a Mario Kart style racer, and while it's fun for a little bit, I never found myself wanting to play it again after I beat the story mode (after little over an hour).\n\nIf you don't own a game like this, this game will be good for you.

I'm not the one who plays car-games so much, but it feels too lose. When you drive, it's okay and no delay, but turning is hard.\n- You fall off too easy (If you drive into few things)\n- They should add voice acting for cutscenes (in the beginning) It will feel more alive.\n- The game crashed first time for me, that it could't find a resolution? So it gave me this message box that it didn't support anything. A restart  & verfy files fixed it.\n- MORE WEAPONS PLEASE! :D\n- You should be able to shoot bagwards, when you have a weapon.\n- It would be great if you could change clothes, skins, etc.\n\nOverall for those things, i find it funny.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shaolu/recommended/320540/","shaolu","Shaolu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shaolu/","101 products in account","This game has a cute concept with fairly decent graphics, and it can provide a few hours of *some*enjoyment, but...\n\n- Something about trying to steer on the existing track design is strangely more difficult than it seems like it should be. You're racing mobility scooters on public streets and yet it's challenging to not run into a wall while taking a corner. I probably end up doing this at least once in every race, and for my 66 year old mother (who was drawn to the concept and I thought might be ideal) it's completely constant. Using a gamepad with thumb sticks helps a bit, but I feel like even with a full blown steering wheel the winding tracks would still prove too difficult.\n- The problem with the above is exacerbated by AI bots that are *incredibly* effective. Even on the lowest difficulty level, it's hard not to get constantly hit by something, and there's no real shielding in the game. If you're lucky, when you notice you're being targeted with rockets or guns and you happen to pick up the defibrillator (a good example of the admittedly clever charm in this game), then you can disable the weapons of the bots immediately around you. However, that won't help if someone sneaks up and whacks you with a cane. It's also possible to lay down some oil slicks, but the bots always seem to successfully navigate around them.\n- It gets to a point where if you haven't upgraded your vehicle in just the right way, by the time you get to the last few tracks, it's virtually impossible to advance. I think I put too much into my transmission and/or weapons rather than upgrading my engine enough, and accordingly I simply couldn't go fast enough to even keep up with the other bots--even if I successfully managed to never hit any walls or get damaged by bots.\n- It's for the above reasons that I never successfully finished the single player campaign and the game proved so incredibly *frustrating* that I just gave up on the whole thing.\n\nHonestly, Super Tux Kart has far better gameplay and features on virtually every level--and that game is completely free and open source. The only thing Coffin Dodgers has that STK lacks is online multiplayer (as opposed to just local split screen). However, since the base game was this irritating I lost interest. I played a few matches online, but the issues persisted, and the only way I could imagine it being halfway enjoyable is if I played without any bots, and last I checked there weren't a lot of servers setup this way anyways.\n\nMeanwhile STK features...\n- Drifting support where you can gain speed while skidding around corners\n- Wider more open tracks that are easier to navigate and far more enjoyable to play with more diverse settings and interesting elements\n- Weapon and defense upgrades that are more well balanced\n- A broader difficulty scale which facilitates AI that won't completely murder you when you're just trying to play through a casual kart racing game\n- It even has better graphics\n\nAll things considered, while the game's concept has some initial charm, I can't recommend it with the current state of its gameplay, especially when there's better cheaper options available. Rather than spending $11 on this game, you'd be better off taking that money and donating it to Super Tux Kart (you'll get a bonus level or two that way too).\n\nhttp://supertuxkart.sourceforge.net/","December 6, 2015","false","4.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Well it tries but naaah it's not..\n\n\nNegative Points\nAI\n- Horribly unfair. The AI is totally unbalanced and unfair. After a few races the "dead" AI got a clear unfair advantage (better top speed, better acceleration).\n- There is also some kind of "one way rubber banding" effect for the AI so they will catch up every time, no matter how good/fast you drive. This is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t!\n- AI often ignores each other and just wait for you to shoot their weapons on you. Also ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t!\n- Winning is a matter of luck. You dominated the whole race? How about a few rockets from a bot, how just caught you up with light speed, so you lose the race on the last 10 meters?\n\nWeapons\n- Unbalanced. Too many aimbot weapons, poor possibilities for defense.\n- Only a few different weapons.\n\nControls\n- Bad and broken. If you brake you will instantly stand still or even drive backwards which sucks if you want to drive/drift around curves.\n- Key assignment works badly. Double assignment all time..\n- Controlling/driving just feels not good.\n\nMultiplayer\n- Dead. If you find 1-2 players it will lags or the connection will be interrupted. Just no!\n\n\n\nNeutral Points\nLevel design\n- Few tracks are good, few tracks are bad.. meh\n- Only a few levels.\n\nGraphics\n- It is nothing special but it fits to the game style.\n\n\n\nPositive Points\nStory\n- Well the idea is ok.. thats it.\n\n\n\nConclusionThe game want to be a funny arcade kart racing game but it failed. Main reasons for its failure are the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI and the bad technical realization of the game idea. Also there is not enough content in the game.\nThe game is funny for an average time of about 2 hours but after that it is only frustrating. You can buy it when it is on sale but 10€ is definitively too much for this game.","December 24, 2015","false","8.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The story is original and pretty funny. The game play leaves a lot to be desired however. Most of the maps have insanely sharp turns and there is no upgrade to improve steering. You either spend the game hitting walls and betting bounced backwards or ride your brake, which is not an effective racing strategy. Especially since brake is also reverse. If you try to brake too hard you (for more than 1 second) you will go into reverse. The AI weapons seem to be able to track while yours can only fire in a straight line.

Short answer, no it hasn't; and here's why:\n1. The Story is still the same length, so the game is still no longer than it was when I originally played it. Added acheivements is nice, but it's as though the devs added those just so you would play longer, and overlook the brevity of the game.\n2. They have added a new mode - some Grandpa mode that I can't think of the name of (and the devs haven't even added this in their blurb about the game contents) - where you have to race around the map to collect items within a certainn time, with each item adding a small amount of time. That was fun, for all of about 10 minutes. *The devs have the potential to expand on this with all sorts of modes, but for me, it's too late now.*\n3. I tried MULTIPLAYER for all of you guys out there, but here's the problem: it's dead. So, that's as far as I got - an empty lobby. I waited a good 10 mins waiting for players. Nothing.\n\nFinal Conclusion: more acheivements and an extra-limited gamemode, couple with dead multiplayer, makes this otherwise "had heaps of potential" game a major disappointment. Definitely still don't recommend the game at the price it is, because, while it is quite polished, it's more of a thin veneer over a mostly empty shell. I won't rate it, but I will give you a personal value of the game: $3. This is based not on how much time and effort the devs put into the game, but the bottom line of how many hours one would probably spend on the game to get most of the acheivements: ~3hrs (and that's playing story mode about THREE times, talk about tedious).\n\n[End of updated review]\n\nTL/DR: "A pretty fun game with lots of potential to be great if A LOT more content is added."\n\nCurently what this game does is grab the elements of good kart games, adds a bit of it's own feel to it, and leaves you with a empty shell of a game. I say this because when I jumped into this game I expected a solid single-player game. What I got was less than 2 hours of gameplay - and it would have been much less than that had I not bothered so hard to upgrade my kart so early on, by repeating a few races. So let's break it down a bit, be a bit more constructive with our bashing of a game that has so much potential to be a good game.\n\nPros:\nGraphically, it's nice to look at - looks a lot like F1 Racestars or Costume Quest - simple, clean and easy on the eyes.\nSounds are also simple - didn't notice any annoying repetitiveness blaring away in my ears, it's all pretty good.\nGameplay is solid. Heck, these three points should make for a great game!\nBut, the Cons:\nStory mode is super short. I reckon it would take me, if I could be bothered, just over an hour each to use each of the 7 characters in story mode. But really, WHY would I bother? I didn't see any other single-player modes, apart from re-hashing the story - Open World Practice and Time Trials anyone?\nWow, major OP karts once you have even half upgraded them. Made the 2nd half of the story mode too easy\nI didn't play this for multiplayer. Maybe one day I'll play split screen, but even then it's limited to 12 tracks (plus 1?)\n\nIn conclusion, this game had me torn - it has so much potential (did I say that already?) But with the lack of SP content alone, I cannot recommend this game anywhere near the price it is.\nIf the devs overhaul the SP into something a LOT bigger - even with a 1/5 of the content of Sonic/Mario/F1Racestars/GasGuzzlers, then maybe we have a game on our hands. As it is, it just doesn't have enough going for it, the devs have a solid base, but they need to get out of the basement, and make this an apartment block. Till then I cannot recommend. Let's hope the devs read some of these reviews and act positively :)","September 26, 2015","false","18.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","2"

However, most won't be able to win, and those who are "dead" continue racing in the next series as zombies. There are five areas, and seven of you (eighth guy is the Grim Reaper himself), with the final are being a one-on-one between you and death.\n\nAs typical in these races, you obtain weapons from mystery boxes and decide when and how to deploy them. However, by winning you can get coins, which can be used to upgrade your mobiling scooter with top speed, acceleration, grip, weapons, and so on. There's even melee, where you use your cane against any one dumb enough to get close to you. There are also plenty of weapons, from the typical "seeking rockets" to "oil slicks" to shields to EMP pulse to Uzi.\n\nGraphics are fast and cartoonish, as expected, and there are full support for gamepads, even split screen keyboard AND gamepad support. There are several oldsters to pick from, each with a slightly different backstory and bonus power.\n\nMusic is a bit repetitive, but not too bad. Sound effects are a bit plain, but workable.\n\nAll in all, Coffin Dodgers is a cute high concept with a proven formula, but doesn't offer something too new. It's fun for a bit of multiplayer and have some mutual laughs. Get it while on sale.","September 6, 2015","true","8.9"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

The concept seemed interesting so I gave it a shot. I launched the game, checked out the controls, and started a single player story mode.\n\nFIRST STRIKE: One of the things they highlighted in the description of the game was these wacky and diverse characters. These range from an ex-Playman magazine centerfold to a retired blues musician to a mad scientist, with about 5 sentences of backstory each. I expected a signature attack (BLUES RIFF!) at the very least, maybe even a character-specific powerup (MAD SCIENCE POTION!) but every single racer is identical. Which leads me to\n\nSECOND STRIKE: The items are incredibly boring. You'll spend most of your time picking up lock-on rockets (even in first place, which is SO useful...) that use the term "lock-on" loosely. They collide with terrain, walls, bystanders, pretty much anything but what you want them to, unless you've got a totally clear straight shot to them. Other items include an oil spill (which is all but invisible on the ground until you hit it, lose your speed and item, and end up 3 places behind), a temporary shield, a boost (which is incredibly dangerous to use most of the time, as outlined in...)\n\nTHIRD STRIKE: Be prepared to smash into things. A lot. Hit a crate? No problem, smash through and gain 10 points (or "xp" as the game confusingly dubs it). Gently brush against a wall in the wrong place? Go flying and end up in 8th. "Alright, well I just smashed through that crate, that car, and that zombie, let me smash through this car-" Go flying and end up in 8th, "this bale of hay-" Go flying and end up in 8th. You see where I'm going with this.\n\nTHIRD AND A HALF STRIKE: After you've gone flying, you lie there as a ragdoll for a moment, before respawning 30 feet back from where you were, in, that's right, probably 8th place.\n\nFOURTH STRIKE: The upgrade system is a joke. You earn coins in the races and spend them on upgrades to improve your scooter, but the AI characters always seem to be just that much more upgraded, because you will probably afford one upgrade every other race.\n\nTL;DR: Controls are shaky at best, physics is a foreign concept, items and content are boring, and I couldn't even force myself to finish the game. Needs massive amounts of work to live up to the description they gave it, let alone be worth playing.\n\nOVERALL SCORE: 2/10, with 4 strikes against it.","September 9, 2015","false","1.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The audio again is fine, although the music can start to grate a little after you've been listening to it for a while.\n\nWith regards to game play it feels very similar to countless other cart racers I've played in the past. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, I enjoyed those old "cart'em-ups" and I enjoyed this one too.\nIt just suffers a little from a feeling of déjà vu.\n\n\nCodger Comedy\n\nThere are two aspects of this game that did shine through for me though.\n\nFirstly, the premise.\n\nWhilst I'm sure some out there will be offended by the term "Coffin Dodgers" and wear their moral outrage with pride against this mobility scooter madness, I found the whole concept hilarious.\nI mean, pimping up mobility scooters, racing grandads, Death riding in a cart, it's comedy gold!\nIt also adds an extra level of tension, if you...

The physics can be wonky at times, the steering violent and the action hectic. Sometimes that's great fun, but other times you touch the side of the track and go flying and go from way out ahead in first to last in the blink of an eye.\n\nThe setting itself won't win any prizes. I guess it is meant to be funny, but it quickly grows old (pun intented). It lacks the fun and sparkle of the leading games in its category and that means you won't be breaking it out at a party unless it is your only multiplayer karting option. The tracks lack variety / distinction, and are generally a bit bland. The weapons don't feel balanced at all, and being caught in the middle of the pack is way more dangerous than being at the front.\n\nStill, it is good for a bit of fun, and is not unreasonably priced. Graphics are decent enough, controls are responsive (even if the steering can be a bit hectic) and the game is done well enough that there are no major gripes. It's just lacking that bit of ooomph that could have really made it stand out.","September 4, 2015","true","0.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

While it is quite similar to other Mario Cart style games I found the quirky environment and characters quite engaging. Making an elderly, mad scientist smack the Reaper in his stupid face with a walking stick is surprisingly satisfying. As was spraying his zombie hoardes full of lead. It's a fairly short game, which might put people off, given the $9.99 price tag so I would suggest you give the free demo a quick spin before purchasing if you're unsure.\n\nI think this is one game that will definitely benefit from using a controller instead of a keyboard. I ended up strewn across picket fences quite a few times while trying to simultaneously build up my melee attack and keep track of my power-ups, but that might have had more to do with my choice of drink than the game itself.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJn7lwsIYgw","September 6, 2015","true","2.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It had a bit of Mario Kart style flare (though it reminds me more of Re-Volt).  Kart racing with a few weapons.  The theme is kinda cute, members of a retirement community racing against Death for their lives and souls.  One interesting mechanic is that you only have to beat the 'living' players at the end of the mini-tournaments, and those that fail come back as zombies.  It does add a bit of a twist to the game.\n\nHowever, this is not a fully polished product.  The physics are very wonky.  The song (singular) is very repetitive after a while - though it does seem that there are a few variations of it in the game.  The weapons are not particularly good, and the tracks can be a little frustrating with having an outcropping right after a very tight turn and the like.\n\nThere's also a few things that may not be obvious right away.  In story mode, when you upgrade your cart, those upgrades keep.  You can restart the story mode and still have those upgrades on that player.  In fact, you can't get all the upgrades in a single play-through, so to fully upgrade your cart you have to play the same character at least twice.  This does mean that if you're getting frustrated at how hard the races are getting, you can restart to power up some more.\n\nThere is also a "score" in the way of "XP" that doesn't really seem to do anything.  It's just there.  You gain some by successfully using weapons, smashing zombies, or running into some obstacles on the track, and can lose some by being knocked off your cart.  There's not a whole lot of balance as to what gives better XP, and there doesn't seem to be any point to them anyway.\n\nAll in all, it's a cheap game that if you are desperate for a cart style racer and don't mind if it's not a triple-A title, and this is on sale, go ahead and pick it up.  Just don't expect a masterpiece.","September 19, 2015","true","4.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The concept is essentially identical, the sensibility is similar, but in the hands of less capable developers the outcome is not the same at all, and the experience suffers for it.\n\nThe central conceit of Coffin Dodgers is that all the racers are very old people in mobility scooters, compelled by the Grim Reaper to race each other to win another day of life.  This is... funny?  I guess?  The game is styled as though it was comedic, but the devs seem to have hung their hopes on the idea that old people and mobility scooters are inherently funny, and thus not bothered to include any actual jokes.\n\nThe environment and track design is adequate, though not much more.  It provides a suitably twisty place in which to race, but you won't be spending much time admiring the scenery.  Some stages provide various objects in the road which can be hit.  Hitting these objects earns you experience points, as does hitting your enemies.  Thus far, though, I can't see any actual use for the experience points other than a meaningless counter.\n\nAs with most Kart games, luck plays as much of a role as skill does.  The effect is particularly pronounced here, though.  You can quickly jump from first place to last in one rocket attack from an AI kart, but also from last to first, if the AI players feud with each other.  The frequency with which this happens in the last half of the last lap makes the race outcomes largely random.  The "whack enemies with your cane" mechanic is also rather unpredictable; I seem to be most likely to hit if I swing when an enemy is to my side, but about a half kart-length ahead.\n\nPowerups are distributed liberally along the track, but there aren't very many kinds; with a bit of luck, it's quite possible to try out every powerup the game has in your very first race.  There's a speed boost, an oil slick, a shield, a rather ineffective machine gun and a very effective missile launcher.\n\nIf there weren't the big name kart games like Mario Kart and CTR out there setting the gold standard -- had the kart game actually been a new concept instead of a well-developed genre -- this could have been a bit more fun.  As it is, Coffin Dodgers emulates the big guys too much to escape comparison with them, and it does very poorly in that comparison.","November 27, 2015","false","3.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

The core mechanics of the game are clearly expressed and well executed, even if the content is currently somewhat limited.\n\nYou select one of 6 retirees, the premise - to outrun death, literally. As expected in these types of games there are various powerups including traps, weapons, shields, boosts, and pulses.\n\nThe combat is coffin dodgers is relatively original and done quite well. In addition to item drop weapons you have a basic attack. This can be tapped to stun and briefly slow opponents, or it can be held down to throw them off their cart. Being thrown off your cart occurs when hit by weapons (depending on the weapon strength) or during high speed collisions, after which you will respawn after a short (but pivotal) period of time. The calculations for being de-carted are done very well and really add a strong element to the game.\n\nThe choice of riders offers no difference other than aesthetics. In single player carts can be upgraded (top speed, acceleration, control, melee damage, item slots and paint job). In the multiplayer mode this translately into a game setting determining what level of upgrades all the carts have. This system means that you can't choose characters/carts with relative strengths and weaknesses like in most racing games. Being early access this may change in the future, however given the current system I doubt it will.\n\nThe levels are well designed, interesting, visually appealing and diverse - with the promise of more to come in the future.\n\nThe modes currently include campaign mode, free roaming of the maps (both multiplayer and single player), and multiplayer modes (online, LAN and splitscreen).\n\nThe pricetag may be a little high for the current content (as is generally the way with early access games) however the promise of future content makes the price worthwhile.\n\nSubscribe to my curator page for more local multiplayer recommendations: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/7189360/\n\nCheck out my Couch Gaming group for specials, bundles, etc: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/CGLM","April 28, 2015","true","3.2"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

For the small amount of content it is definitely not an all-nighter game. Even with it being early access, I still don't feel this will become one of the top racing games, maybe one of the more hilarious games...But it is definitely a repeatable time filler. I hope the online community increases, this game makes you care less about who wins & more about what mayhem you can create in your senior years.\n\nI am looking very forward to all the updates and addons to come for this game. Simple control scheme, very well thought out tutorial. Unique & original plot. Thumbs up to the Devs alone.\n\nPersonal side note, I think ragdoll effects should be emphasized more. Since character arms and legs seem short, it makes it seems as though the effect is minimalized. Also, being able to catch some major air in crashes along with ragdoll could be quite hilarious as well.","June 26, 2015","true","1.1"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

(I don't usually write reviews, though I was asked to for this game.)\n\nI'd say it was a fairly good game, the art style isn't my cup of tea, though I can see why it might appeal to others, I feel as if the controls are all a bit... Jolty, if you press D you better believe you are going to slam into a wall to your right. Though that is not necessarily a complaint, as the maps availiable do have a lot of sharp turns in it that would require such a move.\n\nThe concepts behind the game are funny... Though, I cannot say I would have paid £9 for it, perhaps if it had of been £5 sure, i'd have bought it, as the game seems good enough for a few hours of fun. Though, the lack of a tutorial other than basic movements let it down quite considerably, I still have no idea how the SMG works...","December 21, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Coffin Dodgers gets the most important aspects of the genre right: good controls, appealing graphics, a decent variety of pickups strewn throughout each track, and a garage to upgrade your kart. It also has a morbid sense of humor that hits all the right notes.\n\nAs with any kart racing game, winning is a combination of skill and luck. Yes, there will be times when you're in first place, five feet from winning the race, and you get scattered to the wind by an opposing racer's rocket. The result? Sixth place. If that bothers you, you probably shouldn't be playing a kart racing game in the first place. It's just part of the genre.\n\nOverall, I thought the skill vs luck aspect of the racing to be well balanced. If I raced well, I usually had a chance to win and generally finished in the top three. If I finished toward the bottom of the leaderboard, I usually felt I made too many mistakes.\n\nI do have some minor quibbles with Coffin Dodgers however. Projectile weapons can't be fired backwards. If you get a rocket or a machine gun while in first place, it's basically useless. The ability to fire backwards, even if doing so would give you less chance of a direct hit, would be a welcome addition.\n\nAnother minor disappointment is that there doesn't seem to be any shortcuts or alternative routes on the tracks, at least not that I found. Also, while you can choose from seven different characters to race as, they don't seem to have unique attributes that make racing with one character a different experience than racing as another.\n\nDespite these issues, I enjoyed my time with Coffin Dodgers. I beat the game in about three hours, and I definitely wasn't rushing. I replayed many of the tracks several times, not because I needed to improve my standing, but because I enjoyed the track and wanted to race it again before moving on.\n\nIs Coffin Dodgers the best kart racer on Steam? Nope. That woud be Sonic All-Stars Racing Transformed. If you want the second best, get F1 Race Stars. But as a kart racing fan, I consider Coffin Dodgers to be a solid addition to my library.\n\nCoffin Dodgers is easy to recommend to kart racing fans, especially if it's on sale.","December 1, 2015","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have decided that one of the upcoming reviews will instead be a review of her playing the game instead of me reviewing it.  That aside, I will say that I was pleased that this game was the one I got to play on the steambox today, as it lends itself perfectly into large screen play.\n\nCoffin Dodgers by Milky Tea Studios is, at its essence, a simple Mario Kart clone  Now, originality aside, this is not really a bad thing.  I love playing Mario Kart like games, I think they are often the most enjoyable racing games on the market, though admittedly this may have to with my long-standing inability to play most realistic racing games, but really I feel like that is beside the point, as the Kart Klones really belong in a category all their own.  The racing, instead of trying to get as close to realistic as they can possibly get with your other games, instead only skirts along the edge of vehicle physics, instead opting to give you exciting races by adding new and interesting things into the playfield such as landmines in various disguises.  In Coffin Dodgers, the characters are all geriatrics, so in addition to the  typical red shell (rocket) and banana peel (oil slick) you also get to whack other old people (along with the personification of death) with your old person cane as you race around cartoonish tracks on your seriously tricked out rascal.  Now, a lot of Kart Klones tend to fall off the wagon here, making the balance of racing and items either too much to one side or the other, so it becomes either a poor racer, or a cheap way to annoy your friends with the equivalent of a blue shell disguised as a mile long left turn only lane.  Coffin Dodgers does neither, balancing out easy to use weaponry with a solid racing platform and tight controls, making a game that I actually felt invested in playing, at least as far as the gameplay is concerned.  The story is, of course one of those yadda-yadda race faster than everyone else or death takes your soul blah blah stories, which is fine but really stories like that aren't why you play these.\n\nI will say that though this does have multiplayer, I didn't get the time to find someone else to play with, though if it’s as tight as the multiplayer, I’ll definitely be couch-elbowing my way to victory at least a few times in the coming days.\n\nGame’s Fate: Kept, and will probably be played, maybe even later tonight.  See if I can get my wife to pick up the second controller for this one.\nBuy/No Buy: Absolutely, even at full price this game packs a lot of fun into a clean game, and is totally worth the investment.  Buy!","February 8","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
