It's free and  only like 200mb download. It feels very natural and intuitive to pick up stuff. Physics is kinda ♥♥♥♥ed up but it doesn't really matter, it's a free game.\n\nTo expand more on this, you basically start out immediately as the medic from tf2 in the operating room. There is no tutorial on controls or what to do at all. At first this may seem confusing, but the controls are so damn intuitive that it doesn't matter. You can really naturally pick things up, press buttons, and it feels great. It also runs really well and maintains 90fps even on my old graphics card. So this is definitely a good showcase of the hand controls and runs well too.","April 6","true","0.6"," 47 of 56 people (84%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","84","47","56","8","4"

I don't know what they were thinking.\n\nSurgeon Simulator was designed to be played with incredibly clunky keyboard and mouse controls - much of the charm was in the fact that it was so difficult to do anything, that you'd screw up everything in a highly entertaining fashion. Getting the operations right required extreme precision and lots of practice.\n\nThe VR version seems like a natural step, and it's definitely entertaining, but it's simply far too easy when you have full natural control over your hand(s). I beat this operation on my first try in less than three minutes, where it would have taken me a good 10-15 minutes with the original version. Even though it's free, it's hard to justify such a large download for 3 minutes of gameplay. If you haven't played SS before, you'll probably get more play time out of it - but this version doesn't have a menu or explain how to do anything and you might be very confused.\n\nEssentially all you need to do is remove the ribcage and internal organs without making the Heavy bleed too much. If he runs out of blood, he dies and you lose. You can see how much blood is left in the elevated jar behind him. Once you have removed the organs, well... watch the "Meet the Medic" promo video to understand the rest of the operation.\n\nAs with the original game, the worst thing about this level is the ♥♥♥♥ing joystick that controls the ♥♥♥♥ing medic gun. Its axes aren't aligned with the medic gun itself so the medic gun doesn't move how you would expect when you move the joystick. I recommend getting the medic gun pointed at the Heavy's chest before you do anything else - if you save it for the last step, you'll never get it pointed at him before he bleeds out.","April 7","true","0.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","1"

The game provides you no way of moving yourself around at the moment so even though it isn't listed as a 'roomscale required' title, if you don't have some extra space to move around you may want to skip this for now.\n\nAnother thing is that this is one of the few VR game's I've bumped into where performance has been a bit of an issue.
