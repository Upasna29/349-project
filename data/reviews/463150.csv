Still, not for everyone.\nWould recommend for non-rage quitting 8bit music loving masochists.","May 27","true","1.2"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","10","13","2","0"

Maybe it's personal but for me because of this, the game is just not fun to play.\n-obstacles dodging does not feel reliable - yes you fly fast BUT when you dodge the obstacle in front of you, most of the time you cant figure out how far the next obstacle at left and right, so when you deside where to press - its a game of luck for you if you survive or not, and at the advanced levels - additional visuals blocks the scree - you see directing arrows but they block the vision of incoming obstacles - thats just super lame, they could be transparent or in another place at least where they wont block the vision.\n-this game is very small (55 mb) at the same time it lags the other opened game when 2 games opened simultaneously, i dont know why it loads my i7 so hard  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ but the fps loss pretty big.\n\nConclusion - i cant say its a GOOD game, but you lose nothing if you buy it, try yourself if you will like it or not and you can do the refund, because its a half an hour experience game which costs super low. Little to win but nothing to lose.","May 29","true","0.4"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

Probably not, but you really should, because that's pretty much what this is, except 103% more awesome.  This was such a fun, unexpected experience, and is well worth the few bucks.\n\nWhat sets this game apart from other "rage" games, is that it's still fun even after you've died for the 50th time on the same level.  You don't feel like the developer took the easy way of inflating a games longevity by arbitrarily raising the difficulty of a task.  The bar is set high to begin with, but it's a fun, near impossible challenge.","June 3","true","0.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Even in the frustation of being so close to finishing a level and then crashing, I still was having a good time.  I have a quick review showing what the game is also.

It has every good side of 21st century arcade games, which are good music, well-looking and exciting gameplay and the nicely picked frustration level. I don't want to turn off my PC and crush it even after a half an hour of non-stop gameplay. Great job!\n\n10/10","May 29","true","3.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Upon starting up, I was greeted with aggressively vibrant visuals, and a very focused interface which directed me to gameplay almost immediately.  The game itself is hectic and fast-paced, matching the visual and audio design perfectly.  It's a fun, satisfying challenge that (thus far) keeps itself interesting by periodically introducing new concepts to the same core game.  It's not hugely original, but if you like how it looks you'll probably have fun playing it.","May 31","true","1.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you are bored, after playing this you won't feel bored anymore.\nAfter just the first level my hearth was pouding so fast! And the graphics make it so immersive.\n\nFrom what I've seen you have 7 levels (B, A, R, R, I, E, R), which may seem very few, but the difficulty will keep you from reaching the next level in a small amount of time, so you can expect it to worth the money.\n\n10/10 will keep hiting walls again...and again....and again...","June 1","true","0.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

(yeah, just don't buy if u played flappy bird and ragequit after 1~10 tries, lol)\n\nThe game have 7 levels\nEach level just adds a new type of obstacle or something.\nUnlock the next level by flying for 30 seconds in a level.\n\nPros:\n+ 7 challenging levels\n+ Lovely art (Dunno what to call it, Simplistic maybe?)\n+ CHEEAAAAPP\n\nCons:\n- The music rythm isn't corresponding w/ the game\n- Too hard for some ppl (some ppl rage quits after playing once)\nTHERE ARE LESS THAN 1% PPL THAT BEATED ALL THE LEVELS (from global stat)\n[TO DEV: try to find a middleground, where it's not too hard and not too easy]\n\n*I received the key for free from the dev for review purpose (but it doesn't affect my review)","May 31","true","2.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
