Takes a bit of time to get the hang of it, definitely one of those 'easy to learn, hard to master' experiences. Main gripe is the music track, there is only one, repeating track which while quite nice, will destroy your soul after half an hour.\n\nGame modes, difficulty settings, customisable number of AI per match, even an autoplay mode where you 'do not' play, but watch AI duke it out. Needs multiplayer, but apparently it is coming.\n\nGame seems to be worth the price all in all. Defininitely recommend assuming you like the genre.","April 8","true","0.9"," 20 of 29 people (69%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","69","20","29","4","0"

I got to try a demo of it at PAX South a month ago, and I thought it was a cool concept, but I wasn't sure how well it would actually work as a strategy game. I can now confirm that it works rather well indeed!\n\nIt's very different from any RTS I've played before. Instead of issuing orders to individual units, you're trying to shape an every-shifting pattern into something resembling an army. And, seemingly inevitably, the whole thing grows out of your control: you can't be everywhere at once, and if you spend a minute focussing on one side of the map you're likely to find that your monsters on the other side have mindlessly spread out and populated whole areas.\n\nThe standard "WAR!" deathmatch mode is pretty easy once you've learned some basic tactics: just flood the map with your units and you'll probably win. The other modes introduce some interesting twists; I've tried Capture the Flag a few times now, and every time I think I've got it figured out the AI does something unexpected and ruins me. The AI seems quite clever; it's pulled a few sneaky manoeuvres on me.\n\nI can't wait for multiplayer! Will this be the first RTS I'm actually good at? (Probably not.)","April 9","true","9.8"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","17","24","0","0"

Indie RTS, how good could it be? Well, I couldn't stop playing! I set up to stream it and two and half hours had gone by before I realized! The music is great, the little monsters are adorable, and setting up feedback loops to launch your dudes at their dudes is really hypnotic and fun.  It's got way more depth than I realized, and it's got great macro and good micro strategy.\n\nThe different game modes feel really different - there's your standard wipe 'em out mode, there's one where you have to protect a big castle, another is king of the hill, and my favorite - Migration - where you have to get to the top of the map before the freaking undead take over. It's like game of thrones up in this, because those white walkers are eventually going to break down the wall!\n\nThere have got to be all sorts of little tricks, because you can set up feedback loops without even building Taverns. Taverns are the most basic structure, they force your dudes to go in a circle around it, so that they group up and reproduce. Then you can kind of build little off-ramps to let some pressure out of the loop - if you get too many dudes in one spot, they die! So you put an outlet on your loops and they keep sending dudes out forever, to crush your opponents.\n\nGreat. $9 is a steal, Nonadecimal is an idiot for only asking that much.\n\n","April 8","true","2.8"," 15 of 26 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","15","26","0","0"

Adding the upgrades (roads/shields/swords) add an interesting twist, yet the game remains well balanced and true to Conway's conceptualization.  Interested to see if I can get "gliders"  or some of the other unique patterns that I remember.\n\nThe music is great as are those little critters.  Even in Easy mode, this game is challenging.  A lot of frustration can be avoided by reading the Tutorial.\n\nGreat game!  I'd recommend that the developer add a 'Sandbox' mode that simply runs the algorithm.

I was on the steam store and just happened to buy it the day (or maybe day after) it released and I was extremely pleased. The cellular automata idea is really a cool one.\n\nThat said, there are a couple things that need mentioning if you're thinking about buying it.\n1. Knowledge of Conway's Game of Life would benefit you greatly. I've noticed a couple people saying they're confused by the mechanics, but it's just a modified version of Conway's Game of Life, turned into an actual game.\n2. There are ways to annihilate the computer player easily. If you destroy all your buildings, your cells will propogate into the world quite well. That said, I don't think that's a problem. The idea of the game is to use strategy to defeat the opponent, and that's really fun to do. Letting the game play itself doesn't even benefit you. The value of a victory in this game is that you were able to outplay the opponent, so if you didn't play at all, you gain nothing from a win.\n\nNeither of those are bad things, Just maybe something to keep in mind if you're thinking about buying it.\n\nOverall I like the game, personally I think it's fine as it is, but I'm excited to see where it goes.","May 10","true","10.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","1"

Overall would definitely recommend to anyone that enjoys strategy games and having to think a bit, although there are a few of things that would make the game even better:\n\n1.\ntraining mode: So that new players can quickly grasp the main concept of the game alot better (abusing feedback loops/disrupting enemy feedback loops effectively)\n2.\nmap editer type thing: would absolutely love creating unique maps with quircky game play from map design. Such as there being death pits everywhere, or lots of mountain ridges and setting up interesting zombie maps. With maybe the option to set preditermined spawn points + more AI players on these maps\n3.\nin game time controls: personally I think the the current speed of the game is fine and all, however having the option to slow down to 1/2 the speed or even pause at times to plan out your next moves would greatly be appreciated, as well having the option to go to 2x when you own 60% of the map and youre pretty much guaranteed to win.","April 10","true","1.6"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/clearcryptic/recommended/423800/","clearcryptic","ClearCryptic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/clearcryptic/","46 products in account","Simple and basic once you get your mind wrapped around the logic loops. Most certainly trying to follow the Othello game mindset, "easy to learn, life time to master" kind of thinking. Initially, I had some misgivings about the game but as I play I begin to really understand the way the game should be played. At least I think I am.\n\nThe first thing that you need to know is that taverns don't spawn units. Even after reading how the game worked for some reason I saw taverns as spawning buildings. Although they do facilitate spawning they don't create units. Logic loops are the only form of spawning you can do, which requires at least 5 units. Once you wrap your mind around that, the game makes more sense. The taverns will keep units in close proximity to one another which increases the amount of units you can potentially spawn.\n\nDue to the logic loop system used to create new units, some basic math skills is a must. For the love of God.  Find out how to setup a basic logic loop where you're units feed into themselves but have some kind of release valve. If you have too many units in one place they ALL die. Usually a well placed catapult will do as an output.\n\nThe game form where the AI plays against itself is BRILLIANT! It lets you focus more on how the AI plays which gives you insight on how to play. What happens when you place a building somewhere, when and where they spawn roads/catapults, etc. Very useful when learning the game for certain.\n\nI know I've only put one hour into the game, but I know I can easily put enough time into this game to warrant the price. Once mulipayer goes live, this game could easily be worth $10 to $15 depending how vibrant and fun the multiplayer scene gets. The current price is worth the entertainment value you can expect from this game, so long as you have some basic math skills.","April 9","true","3.9"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

The ressource system in this game is that each building costs units, killing said units if they are nearby or otherwise failing to be built which adds more difficulties to building a massive wall for instance.\nYou can (and will) indeed kill yourself without all the help from anyone.\n\nThe principle of the game makes for really fun and interesting gameplay which is quite unique.\n\nThere are 5 game modes, war (annihilate the enemy), capture the flag, king of the hill, fort (defend a fort and protect it from enemies) and my personal favourite migration (you have a huge horde comming at you from the bottom and all players have to scramble to flee them while killing each other)\n\nAt the moment it does just have singleplayer which despite various gamemodes may for certain people not be worth it.\nHowever if you are a strategy fan you should at the very least follow this game and wait for the multiplayer, which should be great fun.","April 10","true","2.2"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

Wait for multiplayer support maybe. This game seems to be more on the casual side. The enemy AI is not that bright so the game is very easy with little effort to strategizing a winning victory. I found myself just building random catapults (exactly 2 so it's not too many so they continue to multiply) to take the guys out of the initial town and then made them stay put to multiply near the landed spot by building taverns. Then built 2 catapults again to move them elsewhere and a tavern to have them multiply there. Then just rinse and repeat. Not too much strategy to it. Just multiply your guys like crazy as fast as possible which isn't too hard to do. As of now without multiplayer, the enemy AI is way too easy even on the hardest mode. I managed to beat the game on easy, medium and hard all in a row, my first 3 games. If played with other players then might be more of a challenge. I'll change my review if I see it's fun to play with others. I'm not entirely sure if playing with others is fun though since there's really not much strategy to it, but then again, I was never forced to use any strategy fighting against a really dumb enemy AI.\n\nContent is very very lacking for a $9 price tag. You can get litterally 100x more content from games that are about $15 ilke Fortress Craft or a more similar game like Plague Evolved, Inc. which has a great multiplayer dynamic with much more interesting gameplay and truly a game difficult to master the strategy to. Or if you want another strategy game that's as simple as this, there's a ton of Casuals out there at $2 or less.\n\nI'd say for the amount of content this game has, I would categorize it as Casual and I wouldn't pick it up for more than $1.99 as it stands now.","April 12","false","0.7"," 3 of 15 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","3","15","0","1"

I'm sure with the inclusion of multiplayer, the game will soon grow into it's own!\n\n- - -\n\nBear with me, you'll enjoy learning about the system behind the game:\n\nI'm very familiar with cellular automata, and there are tons of different formulas in which the "Game of Life" can be played. Some are made for creating interesting patterns, others can run for hours on end and then fizzle out suddenly, but designing a formula requires balance.\n\nToo many ways to reproduce? The entire screen will be choked out by rabidly deviding cells. Too few and the system will fizzle out with nary an interesting pattern.\n\nThis game's problem is with the former. I can literally put one road out of my tavern and overtake 3 AI's on the hardest difficulty, simply because the AI thinks about how to position it's forces, when all I do is let them breed and overtake the enemy with massive numbers.\n\nIt's a great game, it's unique, and clever, and frankly I'm impressed with how natural it is in almost a "factory designer" sort of way as you build roads to transport your troops, arm them, and then send them off to the enemy, but like I said, no one is going to need to do that.\n\nHow do we fix this? Well we need to take a look at the formula, and I'm sure in time the developers will change it, but as it stands, the game is broken.\n\nFor example:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=667120850\n\nif you take a look at my other screenshots you'll see what I mean.\n\nGreat idea though guys, keep it up!","April 16","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"
