Underneath that though are some truly brain-bending puzzles. And cats.\n\nIt's a programming-style puzzle game. You lay rails to control the flow of cat-trains, which seems simple enough, but those rails can't cross, and they can only attach to the existing tracks at fixed locations. So, solutions involve reusing parts of your railway as much as possible, while accommodating different trains of varying lengths, and then noticing that the very last train ends-up in the wrong place because you didn't think it through properly!\n\nI've not played too far in yet because it's worn my brain out. Having now completed the game, boy does it get hard at the end! Felt great to complete that last puzzle. :D I definitely recommend it if you enjoy at least two of the following: puzzle games, silliness, and cats.","August 12, 2015","true","9.1"," 83 of 90 people (92%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","92","83","90","10","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/abenlen/recommended/386900/","abenlen","abenlen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/abenlen/","176 products in account","This game has cartoon, brightly primary colored cats.  They ride around on colored tracks you build.  If you build the tracks right, the cats fly off into space, thus keeping the Earth from going off orbit and killing us all.   All of this is underscored with a zippy, upbeat soundtrack that is oddly infectious on its own.\n\nThis might lead a casual observer to conclude that this is simplistic game targeted towards children.    That observer would be wrong.  The puzzles seem like they would be straight forward enough.  You can see the trains of kitties that will have to navigate the machine you must build.  So just build colors of tracks that match the kitties that must ride them.  Simple?  Not so much after the first few puzzles.  I got stumped four or five puzzles in.  Solved a few more puzzles, since the game progression isn't completely linear and that is an option.  My brain grew a bit smarter at this, and I was able to go back and finish the one that stopped me.  As much as I like the soundtrack, I soon disabled it to better focus on the mentally engaging gameplay.\n\nThe answers aren't always obvious, at least to someone with my brainpower.  Still, the puzzles do seem doable.  It's refreshing to find a puzzle game mechanic that straddles the line between challenging and thought provoking without crossing over to exasperation.  All with a cheerfully looney premise, adorable oddly colored cats, and a lighthearted cheerful soundtrack that bring capital letter "F" fun.\n\nAbout the only negative criticism I can really think of right now is that there really is only just the puzzle build aspect of this game.  As far as I can tell no score is kept, solving the puzzles and progressing to the next one is it's own reward.  There are, I dunno, 50-ish levels I believe?  I'm not looking forward to the day I run out of them.  Hopefully in the future there will be some DLC with more puzzles.  Also.  it would be super if there were steam workshop support so that players could create share puzzles with the community.\n\nAll in all this is a very nice little title that seems worth the price.   If you like puzzle games I doubt that you'll be disapointed with this one.\n\n8/10","August 13, 2015","true","8.3"," 36 of 37 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","36","37","0","0"

It's a catchy entry in the catalogue of puzzle games, and will draw you in like Catholics to a catechism.  You simply place rails, and cat trains drive along them like caterpillars, with a goal of preventing a catastrophe from befalling the earth.  Avoiding the cataclysm is as simple as flinging cats off the train in the correct order.  Levels become increasingly complex, and some of the more difficult ones have left me feeling catatonic, but finally solving them can feel cathartic.  If you get too stressed out, just take a catnap, have some catnip, and try again.  If you like puzzles, The Cat Machine caters to you, and is a real cat treat.","August 15, 2015","true","4.0"," 32 of 34 people (94%) found this review helpful 31 people found this review funny","94","32","34","31","3"

Now I've actually got the chance to gets some hands-on time with the game, I have to say that it really has surpassed my expectations so far.  It's far, far more than just cats mucking about on trains (as if that would be a bad thing).\n\nOn the surface, all the things you've been led to expect are there - the cats are indeed all over the place, the aesthetic is cute without being gimmicky and a special mention to the music - it's hypnotic and whimsical.  But scratch below that and you've got an addictive, rewarding puzzle game that, after a good hour or so of play, has managed to consistently offer a balance of pleasantly-frustrating head scratching that makes every level completed feel like a genuine minor triumph.  Got plenty of levels to go but the difficulty curve has felt steady and rewarding so far - though I can see this getting very, very tough further on.  And the Science Cat is bloody adorable.","August 12, 2015","true","2.0"," 27 of 34 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","27","34","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BirdCute/recommended/386900/","BirdCute","BirdCute","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BirdCute/","1505 products in account","The Cat Machine is a very eye-pleasing, heart-warming and mind-scrambling puzzle game with tons of cute cats and fun content.\nIf this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.\n\nWhat is happening in the game:You have to make all cats fly into the outer space by making them go on a track that has the same colour as the leading cat. After that track ends, the cat flies away and you have to take care of the next one.\n\nPros:    Gameplay | Although the first thing you will notice is the cuteness of the game, I must set focus to the gameplay idea itself. It might seem unusual when you start playing, but you will get the grasp of it quickly. Having to make an automatic track for all of the different cat trains is really good training for your mind and you will find it pleasant as well.\nCuteness Overload | As you might expect from the Steam Store screenshots and, after all, the name of this game, this game is full of cats. And, man, they make your heart warm and soft and comfy! The soundtrack featuring cat sounds is awesome and so are the meows that can be heard when one of the cats flies away. Charming!\nLevel Design | There are 50 levels and I didn't find them repetitive at all. They have a nice learning curve and it really keeps the game interesting. Some of the later levels can be tough for some people, though.\nOverall Visuals | Leaving aside the cats, the 3D graphics are pleasant for the eye, combined with all of the colours and the waving sea in the background.\nOptions | In the options menu, there are plenty of things to set and change. As the sea can be very resource-consuming, there is also an option to reduce sea quality independently.\nFaster! | As the cat trains can be long and multiple, you would have to wait for a long time to find out if your solution is correct or not. With the fast forward button, you can change how fast the cats are going!\nOS Compatible | Apart from Windows support, you can also play the game on your Mac on a Linux machine!\nSteam-Integrated | You can earn achievements and get trading cards.\nCons:    Level Quantity | I am pretty certain that some people would demand more levels that just 50 after finishing the game. The levels are pretty hard, though, so it should take some time to beat them all.\nNo Workshop Support | To be honest, I am disappointed in the lack of Workshop integration.  People could make their own levels and share with folks that finished the game already. The game would benefit greatly with this.\nThe final verdict:If you like cats, you will like this game. If you like puzzle games, you will love this game. The game is so cute and so fulfilling that I certainly recommend it to anyone, even if you feel like this game is a bit too hard for you. I had a great time playing it and I also repeated some levels to find an even more optimal solution. I had lots of fun with it and I hope you decide to get it for yourself!\n\nGreetings,\nBirdCute\n\nNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes.

It appears science has changed a bit since I was at school! Your journey through the levels is accompanied by a science cat who makes humorous comments as you go along.\n\nBeyond the fun and light hearted theme/presentation of the game (the cat pictures are a nice touch), it has a simple set of mechanics and rules but still provides a challenging and positive experience. There are many levels to keep you occupied and the difficulty steps up as you go along, providing a clear introduction to the key concepts as you progress. Extra depths of complexity also exist aside from basic track placement - for example laying out your tracks so the larger cat trains don't crash into themselves or end up in infinite loops. Eureka moments on the harder levels make the game very satisfying to play, however, the first set of levels are very easy - stick with it and the difficulty gets to a good level soon after.\n\nThe music, although limited, fits the theme of a logical cat machine very well and doesn't get in the way of your train (heh) of thought - I end up muting some puzzlers but not this one.\n\nIf you like Cats, Trains or puzzlers then this game shouldn't disappoint.

The game almost makes fun of itself, and it's pretty funny. The game is about directing conveyor belts to get cats on rails across levels. The music is cute and weird (kind of creeped me out too :).\n\nWhen I first started playing, it was a bit hard to understand what to do and how to play, but I quickly caught on. When I did, the game was really fun and was never boring; I had a hard time quitting out of it! In the middle levels, the game got hard and a bit frustrating, and I was constantly changing levels to see if the other ones would be easier. If you put your mind to it, and you tried a lot of different things, you could get through the levels. So, would I recommend The Cat Machine? If you like cats and sort of stupid and fun games, absolutely.","January 3","true","1.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Me and my wife love cats, that was probably the main reason I bought this game ))\n\nThe so-so:\n- graphics are pretty basic, with single-color fills and thick black contours, which is typical on mobile. They are appropriate for the humorous tone of the game but clearly with some professional 2D art the game could look a lot better\n\nThe bad:\n- some of the meows of cats don't feel natural. It may be they are indeed true recordings of a cat, but they somewhat seem too different from each other. There are also too few of them (just 4 or 5).\n\nI'd recommend this game if you love cats, have a higher education or are getting one, and don't have this game on mobile already. It's not too expensive, and there are plenty of levels to beat.","April 12","true","3.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Take it for what it is, a great m ini game inbetween your full on games that you are playing. It's like a break from the norm for me.\n\nMusic is in the wonky, Disgaea type flow.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gamingtrevor/recommended/386900/","Gamingtrevor","Gamingtrevor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gamingtrevor/","203 products in account","To read my full review and see gameplay go to Mouse n Joypad, click here; http://mousenjoypad.com/reviews/pc/the-cat-machine-review/\n\nWhen I first saw the game, I felt like they may be using the cuteness factor of cats to sell a subpar puzzle game. I was wrong. The game offers some real challenge, demanding that you build an all purpose solution to several different problems. The Cat Machine requires crafty thinking and some patience in order to solve these complex conundrums. Anyone looking for a great strategy game for the weekend could do much worst than this thoughtful and cute game. I‚Äôm proud to say that The Cat Machine is more than welcome to has a cheezburger.\n\nThe titular contraption is a sophisticated piece of machinery that uses unimaginable technology, maintaining the stability of the Earth as it rotates the sun. Yes, it turns out it‚Äôs all thanks to a series of colorful cats being thrown off of train tracks that keeps our life-giving planet on its orbit. Thanks a lot Newton; it doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with gravity at all. It was cats.\n\nThe game is relatively easy to understand. You‚Äôre given a train of cats, made up of a random selection of three different colors (blue, yellow and red), and ending with a white cat. The cats follow the leader, its color deciding which extensions the train will go down. After they go over one of the bridges that you‚Äôve placed, the lead cat flies away, leaving the next in the train to go down another colored path. The goal is to end the journey with the white cat flying off the solidary white path.\n\nDoesn‚Äôt sound too hard, and it feels especially easy in the earlier stages, but this gets dramatically harder as you progress. The game throws more complicated level designs at you, and sometimes you‚Äôll have up to five different trains you‚Äôll need to map out. So, not only will you have to make a route for one train, but you‚Äôll have to build it to accommodate several other different paths as well.\n\nWith that being said, you will slam your head into your keyboard several times while playing this game; but it‚Äôs okay. You‚Äôll eventually figure it out, and you‚Äôll feel very satisfied as the cats triumphantly circle the screen, meowing out a jaunty little song. Again, it‚Äôs cute, and its playful attitude doesn‚Äôt intimidate those who may feel like a ‚Äòdum-dum‚Äô when they struggle with problems.\n\nThe 50+ levels simply get too repetitive for its own good. Its minimalist approach is fine, but the levels end up feeling two-dimensional, and possibly adding some height or obstacles to the paths might‚Äôve given the experience more diversity. That‚Äôs not to say the challenge isn‚Äôt there, because it is- I just felt like I was solving a different version of the same puzzle each time. Even the scheme of the levels are mostly the same, with a similar ocean background occupying every platformed level.\n\nOverall, this isn‚Äôt a bad game, but it‚Äôs lacking that something to make it truly memorable. The puzzles are engaging, so if you‚Äôre someone who likes getting your brain twerked for twenty minutes as you try to solve a puzzle, this will satisfy that part of you that likes torturing your noggin. While its ten dollar price point is on the higher end of where a game like this should be, I can honestly say it gave me a few chuckles, and a rewarding experience when I solved something I started to convince myself was impossible. Plus, it has cats; so if that‚Äôs a buying factor for you, I‚Äôd say pick this game up meow. Sorry, couldn‚Äôt resist.","August 14, 2015","true","4.7"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

The puzzles start off easy, with light quirky humour to ease you in, and then the tricky puzzles come along - something to get one's claws into. The beginning puzzles might take a few minutes but it didn‚Äôt take me too long to arrive at levels where I‚Äôm sitting there for 20 minutes puzzling away. Some levels are a nightmare and I had to temporarily give up ‚Äì even on these puzzles I wasn‚Äôt annoyed at the game, just annoyed at my own stupidity. It‚Äôs certainly a clever type of puzzle system and enjoyable, if you like puzzles. The gentle presence of cat humour is welcome.\n\nThe soundtrack is perfect and really suits the game. The main theme is catchy and the ambient gameplay music is in the same vein as SimCity, it's nice to listen to but can easily loop for a few hours without becoming annoyingly repetitive.\n\nSo, this isn‚Äôt a catastrophe of a game, quite the opposite.
