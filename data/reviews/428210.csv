Let's focus on the difference between a 'challenging' game and a 'pube-wrenching monstrosity'.\n\nChallenging: Remove checkpoints of any kind from your game, forcing the player to return to the start each time they die.\nP-WM: Wait until the player has suffered half an hour of switch puzzles, hiding under tables from medieval skeletons, godawful controls for the doors and lockpick minigame which punishes you for its own hideous design by forcing you to run around waiting for bobby pins to respawn, and then outright MURDER them by inexplicably dropping a spider on their heads, forcing them back to the start of the game and even having the door codes randomized to slow you down as you slog through the opening fifteen minutes for THE SEVENTH BLOODY TIME.\n\nRandomly throwing enemies into corridors that you can't outrun and kill you in one hit? Not cool, man. So uncool that even Dustin Diamond is looking at you like you crapped your pants in public.\n\nIck.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqKe7gx3sMo","February 3","false","1.4"," 45 of 48 people (94%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","94","45","48","20","1"

There are no checkpoints, no save points, nothing. You have no health; any enemy that attacks you will defeat you instantly. And any time you die, you are going all the way back to the start of this game. This is obnoxious enough in and of itself, but this gets far worse. Twice I have had the game glitch out and keep me from being able to move. One of these times was, no joke, about 10 seconds from the end of the game.\n\nThe story is nonexistent, and there is no proper ending either. The physics are strange. Just try using the numberpads that come up with a 360 controller. I dare you. There's a meter that shows how...in trouble you are, or something, but I have no idea if it actually does anything. It has no effect on the actual monsters, certainly.\n\nThe price is out of this world for this game. When you actually know what you're doing, it takes about 10 minutes to finish. That's if you make it past all of the trial-and-error and glitches. I am very disappointed in this game.\n\nUPDATE: I managed to finish the game now. I ended up getting stuck at the elevator literally 4 more times before I figured out the trick to bypass this game-breaking glitch. When you get on board the elevator and it's descending, press yourself right up against the elevator door and keep moving forward against it. You'll hop off the elevator into the morgue room without getting stuck. You have to get on/off the elevator twice more but I was able to do that without my game breaking.\n\nAs one can expect, with no checkpoints and a consistent game-breaking glitch so close to the end, I still cannot in good faith recommend this game, especially as it is a consistent issue. I will edit my review if further updates arrive, but having to play around a glitch like that is absolutely ridiculous.","February 24","false","7.0"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","4"

Bought the game for 7 bucks, complete waste of money, there were no checkpoint or saving system to be found, the puzzles were seemingly meaningless and boring. And once you get killed that's it...your back to square one. What sort of bs is that, you could be 6 puzzles through and all of a sudden without warning you get killed by some skeleton or something and you have to start the ENTIRE game again!!! There were no tutorials to teach you how to play and most of the puzzles don't even make sense. I would hold off on buying this game unless you like your money to be wasted and like to play tedious games that have no tutorials, horrably designed levels, crap storylines, clueless npc opponents and aweful puzzles of which you can't make heads or tails of, and for f***sake no checkpoint or saving system! Very disapointed I give this game a 2/10 for atleast making me occupy 40 minutes of my time. Deffinatly not worth even 1 dollar, and I think you are better off saving your money for something else. I wouldn't even suggest playing this game for free.","March 27","false","0.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

While I found the game to be very beautiful in how it looked and I liked the ambient noise that went with it. The over all gameplay and controls were not that well designed. You are almost forced to play the game with a controller, but you still need a keyboard and mouse to select choices for a new game or any options so the design of the interface felt like it was not really optimized as far as it could be when the option was given. I go into more detail and you can see what I mean in the video below.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/LfE1HS7WjwI","February 2","false","1.1"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","13","22","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/recommended/428210/","altered_confusion","Altered_Confusion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/","289 products in account","You find yourself locked away in an asylum, and you're going to be the only one who is going to get you out of there. So you will have to explore the asylum, find what hides in the dark, and solve puzzles that present themselves as the asylum doesn't want to let you go easily.\n\nIn Horror in the Asylum you will have plenty of puzzles to solve, but there is always just one solution. This of course will come in handy when you die and start the entire game again from scratch. There are no save points in this game, there is no randomizing of the level, and to be honest there's not a whole lot of excitement when you're doing a specific section for the 15th time.\n\nMy biggest issue with the game is that there's a good chunk of it that is trial and error, and the error sends you back to the very beginning of the game. Sure this game will keep you wondering what will happen next, but an even bigger thought is, "am I going to have to do all of this over AGAIN???"\n\nNow that's not to say that there aren't some interesting things in the game, but there are more frustrating and boring things that will cause you to want to drop the game after a while. You of course need a flashlight to move around in the dark halls, and I really like the blue light that reveals that which is hidden. I do find it odd, however that when you hide in cover that your light automatically turns on, even if you have it off, or blue. You can then toggle the light all you want without an indication of what position the light will be in once you get out of cover. Speaking of getting into cover, you will have to bend to fit in a spot, or crawl under a bed, however there is no crouch mechanic for items that are basically at knee level so you have to get just the correct camera angle in this first person view to collect items.\n\nI could also mention that this game crashes every time I've exited the game, and look I just did, but that's the least of my worries when it comes to this game. There's something about it that seems like it was rushed. It feels like there's a story here, but there's no polish. The text choice for the notes that you collect while walking through the asylum have a terrible font choice which makes it difficult to read. There's also the lock picking mechanic that doesn't feel right.\n\nI really want to say that this game is worth playing through, but I can't, I really can't, and it really has to do with the forced rinse and repeat actions that are constantly occurring. After so many restarts it's just not worth trying to go through the exact same steps again. This game gets a 4.7 out of 10.","April 14","false","1.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm running it at 1080p and it looks gorgous, and it makes all of the scares even scarier. The puzzles were pretty well done, a few were kind of simple, but the various gameplay conventions felt really nice. I didn't have any issue with the controls, but I only tried mouse and keyboard.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/granantuan/recommended/428210/","granantuan","GranAntuan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/granantuan/","21 products in account",""Horror in the Asylum" has a strong concept. That's what counts for me in Horror Games. The strong atmosphere, the musical score, so terrifying precisely because of its minimalims. But its strong point is the creation of a character who gets in the player head. It made me feel totally unbalanced and unsure of my perceptions. This game creates the feel that you can not trust your mind and that's intimate storytelling. All the negative points I have read are easily solvable. This game has a soul and that's not easy to achieve... I'm sure the developer will hear the complaints and will act on them. I'll keep playing this game and will support the developer. Excuse my English (I'm from Spain). Take care and play safe :)","February 2","true","1.2"," 5 of 21 people (24%) found this review helpful","24","5","21","0","0"

It will also appeal to people then enjoy memorizing entire levels. On the other hand,starting all over isn't the greatest thing. I wish this game hadcheckpoint, unfortunately it doesn't. There's a lot of memorization this game and if that's what you're into then good luck. I recommend this game although in my own personal opinion I would give it a 7 out of 10.
