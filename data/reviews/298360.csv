ID is one of the best Tower Defense style games I have ever played.\n\nOn a mechanical level, the towers are not the formulaic set you find in most other games. You know, the "weak but fast" tower, the "long range and slow" tower, the "splash damage" tower, etc. You won't find that here. Each of the towers has vastly different behaviors, making you think more carefully about placement. Behavior can change as you upgrade them, and they can also interact with your cursor as well (which is a weapon in its own right).\n\nThe game is also very challenging - experienced Tower Defense players will be tested here. But, the difficulty can be adjusted along the way, so if it's just too hard, you can dial the difficulty down a bit - for the one level you're having trouble with - and come back to it later if you want.\n\nVisually, Immortal Defense is fun. This is an older game but it still looks great. It's somewhere between a dream, a laser light show, and an LSD experience all rolled up into one. The visuals can also be dialed up and down as needed, though, so if it is too much for you, you can get back to a more "sane" experience. I recommend keeping on the higher side.\n\nThe music is great too - it has a delicate, mystical quality that fits very well with the art style.\n\nGenerally, tower defense games have at most a token storyline, something that is easy to throw away and ignore. But Immortal Defense delivers here, too - taken as a whole, the story of Immortal Defense gets into some interesting philisophical questions about immortality, good and evil, what is really important, etc. The towers (called Points in the game) come out of the story, and their names and functionality are drawn out of it as well.\n\nIt might be a bit too cerebral for a lot of people, but it won't interfere with the gameplay.\n\nFor the Steam version of the game, there are new challenges that you can complete for additional bonuses during gameplay. There is also a leaderboard.\n\nOverall, I rate this as a very strong buy for anyone who enjoys the Tower Defense genre and is looking for something a little different. Visuals aside, I put ID on the same level as other TD greats.\n\nDisclosure: Studio Eres provided me with an advance copy of the Steam version for the purposes of play testing and review.","August 31, 2015","true","141.8"," 56 of 58 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","56","58","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/phoenixfeiren/recommended/298360/","phoenixfeiren",".//slayer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/phoenixfeiren/","379 products in account",""Wa-a-a-it a minute, is this another one of those tower defense games? How many of them do we really need?" - you're probably asking yourself at the moment. Why yes, indeed, it IS a tower defense for PC - a platform already chock-full of various games of the kind. You might have already played Defense Grid, spent some evenings grinding Defender's Quest, maybe partied in the co-op mode of Dungeon Defenders with a couple of friends... So, why waste time on yet another game of an exhausted genre?\n\nTo put it shortly - yes, we do need Immortal Defense. Right off the bat - when playing ID, you're not just an omnipresent authority figure (c), you ARE the guy who actually shoots stuff in top-down perspective. That little mouse cursor on screen that lets you build your towers? That's you right there, or rather your soul, personification of your willpower - whichever you prefer. It's the embodiment of a player in the game, and one of the signs of its unorthodox approach - combining the control mechanics with the actual gameplay, making the player a major part of the action while removing any unnecessary medium. Very few games do this ("Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons" comes to mind, check it out when you can), and to see this from a "mere" tower defense? Not bad, not bad at all.\n\nBut then we move beyond the interface and controls and look at the game itself, and... Geez, is that a plot segment I see in-between the missions? Some kind of a mystic space opera? Why do I even need a plot in a tower defense game? It boils down to shooting unremarkable enemies throughout a hundred of levels anyway, right? Right?... Well, not in this case, it doesn't. From the very beginning the game makes you feel responsible - you are not just a figure behind a computer desk, consolidating some defense force around your planet. You have been chosen to leave everything you knew behind and transcend into a new form of being - the form no one really knows much about. It's the sacrifice you made for your loved ones - and each message from them, received after successful battles, reassures you in the righteousness of your task. To become a god of space between worlds, to be the last hope of your home planet - what's not to like?\n\nAnd yet, the Universe operates on a different level, and not every action has clear consequences. Concentrating your will to create needle-sharp "points" - your line of defense against the invading armies - you fail to notice how decades after decades run by. The Universe is engulfed by war, and there's little time for you to think of what the future holds for you when you finally turn homewards. But when you do... will there really be home to return to?\n\nThere are many other beings like you, created with the same mission in mind - to protect, to defend, to repel. And yet, as you soon realize, not everyone can bear the centuries of loneliness. For that matter, can you?..\n\nBut the transcended existence has its own benefits - with each passing day, your memories shatter, but your will gets stronger. Learning more and more advanced techniques, assembling more and more powerful points, you manage to overcome the limitations of spirit once imposed upon you. What lies beyond? Will it be paradise for those who rely on you... or will you only descend deeper into hell?\n\nTo put it shortly, Immortal Defense is not an easy game to review. The controls and mechanis are closely intertwined with gameplay, and the gameplay itself depends heavily on the story. There are no decisions per se, no roads to take, but the final result still doesn't disappoint - in the very end it feels like you walked your own path, made your own choices. Complicated relationships with your family's descendants and the ones who you once thought your enemies only make it harder to progress, and the game itself becomes more and more complex with each mission, never forgetting to introduce yet another enemy pattern or some dimensional trick to keep you off guard. Overcoming those and using every available ability to your advantage - that is the measure of a true Ghost of the Path. And trust me, with the Steam release, the game has obtained a LOT of new shiny toys for you to experiment with, as well as a real sense of an almost RPG-like progression - just take a look at all the bonuses that achievements and medals provide!\n\nI first played ID when it was released years ago, and I still play it to this very day. With each playthrough, I feel as if I learnt something new - not just about the game, but about myself, too. Is there anything else to wish for? Well, maybe some cool graphics effects and nifty tower designs - in which case you'll find those here aplenty. ;) Happy hunting, Great Ghost! And never forget where you came from.","September 8, 2015","true","12.6"," 22 of 22 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","22","22","2","0"

It's never a case of "the slow tower + the aoe tower" always assures victory.\nLet's be honest though there are hundreds of tower defence games out there so what sets this on apart?\nThe story.\nThe story is a fantastic exploration into what it means to be immortal and explores such themes as loneliness, betrayal and insanity. It's astoundingly deep content to have in a game of this genre.\nIt's hard to say any more without spoiling the experience so just go play it yourselves!","August 31, 2015","true","37.0"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bormac/recommended/298360/","Bormac","Bormac","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bormac/","694 products in account","Immortal Defense is a pretty interesting tower defense game. It touches on some odd topics for a video game but it sure made me think about things that very few games can manage.\nThe story itself is pretty enjoyable and the game takes awhile to run through. So it is a decent investment on time I found. With six different plot lines that take place over sixteen missions a piece. And a bit of extra content if you can find it. It certainly kept me occupied for awhile.\nIt follows the adventures of an almost unnamed protagonist as he becomes his worlds only defense against an alien menace in what they call "Path Space" Which feels a lot like hyperspace, to me. And that's what it plays as, it is a short cut from point A to point B in space. And you are there, looking down at the ships trying to venture through. And this gives you a severe advantage over them. But in this state you are incorporeal, and seperate from your body. Time passes differently. How do you handle this, all the presure of so many lives depending on your constant vigiliance and being seperated from everyone you know and love. The story touches on this in many ways. And also friendship and betrayal as well. But I'll leave those for you to discover.\nIt's also quite atmospheric and charming. I haven't seen any tower defense games where your towers talk to you and have their own personalities. It's very interesting to see what all they have to say as you play the game. And how they respond to the things happening o nthe screen.\n\nOne of the things I like most about Immortal Defense  though is the music, it really draws me in and makes me feel there, in the moment and I think grabbing the soundtrack is worth the price of admission by itself. But that's just me.\nMusic aside, the visuals are another strong trait the game has, falling somewhere between a rave and some sort of bizzare drug trip, they are certainly something to see. Though on higher settings might be a bit much for some people of more frail constitution. But that is easily adjusted on the main screen via slider.\n\nAnyway, This is a game that I absolutely adore and have played through multiple times. Twice for fun and once to get to the secret stuff! Worth the money I spent, way back before it got on steam. And I will be buying it again now, for friends to enjoy!\nOverall, I would say, if you like tower defense games, or games that touch on philisophical things, this would be a very strong buy. The musics and graphics are great, for the games age, and it is really more about the aesthetic amyway, at least that's how I feel!\n\nDisclosure: Studio Eres provided me with an advance copy of the Steam version for the purposes of play testing and review.","August 31, 2015","true","24.9"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

There are a lot of them out there, and many don't ultimately have much to offer. But Immortal Defense is an exception, and I'll likely use this new version as an excuse to play through the game again.\n\nImmortal Defense has a unique style, engaging mechanics, and an evocative story. You might not expect the writing to be a strength in a game of this type, but that's one of the elements that set Immortal Defense apart.\n\nI'm also looking forward to Studio Eres's other upcoming release Saturated Dreamers.","September 1, 2015","true","9.7"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","11","11","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kermamrek/recommended/298360/","kermamrek","Kerma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kermamrek/","289 products in account","Whether you're new or old to tower defense games, Immortal Defense is a good buy. With tons of unique mechanics but still holding together what makes a good tower defense a good tower defense, and on top of that all a great story considering it's a game where you're shooting geometrical shapes flying on a line... Immortal Defense is amazing for what it is.\n\nIn Immortal Defense, you play as a Pathspace Defender whose goal is to defend your home planet by literally becoming a god and shooting invisible hellbeams from another plane of existence at people who are invading you. You do this by what else- placing towers! While the story and gameplay get more complicated than that (and bring all sorts of delightful twists and turns), that is the basic premise to the game.\n\nIf you're new to the game, you might be pleasantly surprised by the gameplay and strange quirks it has. Each tower is more unique than the usual tower defense tower, with every single one having completely original properties and not just "the splash damage tower" and "the one that shoots fast". Not only that, but you have a stake in the action as well; you use your mouse cursor to charge up attacks and interact with some of the attacks of your nearby towers to efficiently take out harder enemies. The strategic depth of the game gets pretty crazy later on, with enemies you have to pinpoint and "snipe" with your cursor or else they'll buff other enemies to the point of being unstoppable. You'll also find that although the story starts out a bit slow it picks up very fast and perfectly placed cliffhangers keep making you want to play more.\n\nIf you're a returning player, why buy the steam version? The non-steam version is currently pay what you want on the site (unless it's been taken down). The steam version has all kinds of great new features, from almost doubling the length of the base game with side missions and campaigns to giving you permanent "upgrades" sort of by completing weird challenges to make the notoriously harder levels a tiny bit easier. Not only that but there is a more in depth graphical system (with widescreen support finally) and leaderboards/steam workshop integration so you can play other people's levels that they made with great ease.\n\nSo would I recommend Immortal Defense? With an overwhelming response, yes. It is one of, if not the best and most unique tower defense game I have ever played and the story is also seriously great (even though it can come off as trying too hard a time or two). For 9-10 dollars this game absolutely deserves to be checked out.\n","August 31, 2015","true","35.9"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/servelius/recommended/298360/","servelius","Servo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/servelius/","269 products in account","I find it difficult to put into words how I feel about this game but here is my best attempt.\n\nIn 2007 (2008?) I was beginning to gain interest in, "indie games." One of the games that I saw was the most highly acclaimed was Immortal Defense, reborn on Steam after 8 years.\n\nI was never very good at tower defense games, and to be honest I'm still not good at them. Back then I tried to get through as much of the story as I could (on difficulty 00 never the less) but I think my brain stopped being able to handle it around the half way point of chapter 3. The game is difficult and can take a lot of thinking to fully understand. Part of this is because there doesn't seem to be an, "optimal," strategy for each level. There are ways that don't work, but especially later on you can figure out many different ways to beat them. I ended up cheating my way through a lot of the game from that point. Sorry Paul, I did it back then and I might have to do it again. I'm just not clever enough for your later levels.\n\nThe visuals, while simplistic, make up for it in terms of color, style, and how fitting they all are. The game looks really damn nice now. Still simple, but even more juiced up with all kinds of interesting effects.\n\nThe music can range between infectious and grand with some great melodies but you can definitely hear that it was a bit of a budget affair. I spotted some midi bass that seemed out of place.\n\nBut the real thing that makes Immortal Defense so special to me was its story and how it affects the gameplay. You play K, a person who has given up his body to defend his home world from invaders, detacting himself from the physical world to defend it from pathspace. K left all he loves physically - but not mentally. In pathspace, K uses parts of his being, mainly his emotions manifested into towers to destroy enemies in pathspace. They speak out in the middle of the game with character, making the battlefield feel alive.\n\nK's journey is a philsophical one that tackles a lot for a game: what matters to a person, what drives them, what the nature of reality is, what the nature of truth is, how powerful you can become and how it influences others, and how it would be like to live alone, forever in a place away from any mortal eye.\n\nThe writing is very well done. It is never these huge philosophical rants, rather the characters give you information and story through the use of subtle phrases that you can put a lot of thought into.\n\nNot only that, the levels range from abstract to very purposely made symbols that represent what is happening in the game.\n\nThe point is: The story and mood of Immortal Defense seems into every crevice of the game. Every element in the game seeks to bring you into the story of K. His story is a hypothesis on what might it be like if you, the player, were to embark on this grand journey a million years long.\n\nI finished the game long ago in 2007 (2008?) early in the morning. It made me think about my own place in the world, made me feel profound emotions and has given me a quote to live by to this day. Rethinking about the game gives me chills and to this day fills me with the feelings of...I can't really put them into words.\n\nMaybe it was me being naive and being sensitive. I'm a sensitive guy, what can I say? But this is my experience from the game. Even if no one else feels the way I did, this game hit me hard and inspired me in many ways.\n\nWhen you have nothing left, you must create your own reasons for existening. Some people cling to the past, others surround themselves in their own creations.\n\nHere are two quotes that have stayed with me all these years.\n\n"There's one thing you can rely on in this universe: being as wrong as often as you are right. So whether you're right or wrong -- Be exceptional at it. That's morality."\n\nand\n\n"I love you grandpa."\n\nThank you Paul and the rest of the developers behind Immortal Defense. I'll never forget this.","August 31, 2015","true","2.8"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","4"

The writing never feels particularly artificial and it's well paced with regard to the gameplay.\n\nThe gameplay can get a bit repetitive toward the end, but I think it's novel enough to keep going. Your 'points' (towers) take the names of various emotions or mental states. There are about ten points-- of those, I think that four or five are truly unique among games of this genre.\n\nYour currency carries over from level to level, so you're incentivized to perfect a level with the least possible investment. This means that there's reason to repeat levels, and if you're like me you'll find yourself doing so over and over again.

For example, you amass the resources you spend to build points by beating stages. When you start a stage, you can decide the difficulty at which you would like to attempt the stage. Increasing the difficulty makes the stage harder, but also increases the amount of resources you earn by completing the stage. Playing the stage at a lower difficulty is useful for advancing the story and unlocking new abilities. There is no strategic disadvantage to playing stages at a lower difficulty, as you can go back after the fact and replay those stages at a higher difficulty. Rewards that you earn will be retroactively applied to your current resources, if they are higher than your previous high score on that stage.\n\nThe game has really interesting visuals, resembling some sort of psychadelic screen saver when all the effects are turned on. The soundtrack is similarly interesting. The background music is mostly a moody and dark orchestral score. The different types of points and enemies have unique sound effects when they interact. The combination of these causes particularly busy stages where you build a lot of points to sound like the product of some mad composer. The story is also compellingly weird, and there were times I found myself motivated to complete stages in order to discover more of the narrative (which trickles in bit by bit at the beginning of each stage).\n\nI don't know if Immortal Defense was a labor of love, but it definitely feels like a lot of time, thought, and effort has been spent on refining it. If you're a fan of the tower defense genre, you'll definitely enjoy Immortal Defense.","December 17, 2015","true","32.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

If you don't like TD it's still absolutely worth a look.\n\nIt's not only my favourite tower defence game, but it's one of my favourite games, full stop. I loved it back in 2009 when I first played it and this new Steam version comes with a raft of improvements over the original, hence why I'm playing it again. It still holds up beautifully.\n\nIn Immortal Defense, you have given up your world and physical body to become an immortal defender in 'pathspace', a dimension above hyperspace. There, you are but a ghost to the Bavakh, one of the most tyrannical races in the galaxy, who are using hyperspace to attack your home planet Dukis. As a path defender you focus aspects of your will -- fear, love, courage, pride, precision and others -- to form 'points' (the towers of ID) to stop the Bavakh. This is how the game begins, but it's far, far away from where it ends.\n\nSo what makes it special? It's many things. It's the haunting story, the turns it takes and the themes it deals with. It's the hugely inventive and unusual towers. It's the way the mouse pointer is used as its own tower; shooting, charging shots and synergising with other towers in powerful and unexpected ways. It's the kaleidoscopic visuals, the warbling, droning sounds and the crystalline shattering of enemies as they bleed and streak light across the screen. It's the strange enemy designs and their unusual abilities. It's the rousing and understated soundtrack. It's the many challenging levels (and the new challenge stages which restrict what towers you can place, encouraging you to use them more effectively). It's the little things like kill counts per tower so you can gauge how effective your layouts are, or the recycle value of a tower degrading over time so a quick placement mistake won't punish you-- and mass end-of-level-selling won't help. It's your cache rolling over from one level to the next to encourage efficiency. It's the endless simulated assaults bookending each chapter, testing what you've learnt and ultimately determining how much cache you start the next chapter with. It's the level editor and the bundled fan levels, the detailed in-game manual, the leaderboards (if you're into that kind of thing), the ability to slow down time when things get manic (or speed it up if your line's holding)... and more.\n\nAt £6.99, or $10(ish), it's an absolute steal for a game this unique, heartfelt, evocative, clever, challenging and brimming with content.","September 14, 2015","true","14.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Gameplay is quite creative and you're actually involved enough as a player that it doesn't feel like you're waiting inactivly after the towers are placed.\n\nThe game does bog down slightly towards the end once you've gotten every variety of tower and most enemies have been introduced, especially noticeable in the very end campaign. The variety of both towers and enemies up until that point kept the game very fresh, it's certainly a game I would recommend giving a go if you have the time, certainly if you're a fan of the genre; It does have the distinction of being the first tower defence game I have actually played for a decent amount of time and finished.\n\nA final mention is that I quite liked how achievements were handled, actually getting something concrete rather than a useless note on your game profile.","September 28, 2015","true","84.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
