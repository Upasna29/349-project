The last time I played it was around two weeks prior to official release. I played the game pretty much to completion with a max level Cannoneer on the Beta server. Although my experience with the max level content was limited, what was available was pretty much the same earlier dungeons just scaled up.\n\nBasically (TL;DR), the game is alright, and its free so you might as well give it a bash.\nIf you're seeking any sort of challenge the leveling phase is completely lacking in it, the combat is interesting albeit very spammy, the quests are dreadfully repetitive, and the world art design is nice. As far as MMOs go, it's probably one of the best I've played in recent years, though please take that with the consideration that I'm someone who is pretty much burnt out on MMOs after years of WoW and a spurt of others, so I tend to avoid them. Though with that mindset taken into consideration, the fact that I was able to be interested and for the most part enjoy my 30plus hours with Devilian should be taken as a fairly strong endorsement.\n\nSo.. let's get started!\n\nThe Good:\nAs far as MMOs go, this is a prety good combat system. If you're familiar with Diablo 3, Neverwinter, DOTA2, LoL, etc.. it's a lot like that, just with more abilities available to use at any one time. Depends on the sort of movement style you choose to play with, I suppose. The game includes options for typical WASD style, or left or right click to move. I personally went with click to move and that worked fairly well. My only complaint here would be that it's very spammy. As in you need to click or hold a button or key to spam out the same ability a lot.\nSome games hurt my hand after prolong periods of play, and towards the end of my time with this game, it got onto that list (my problem is nothing major, but it was definitely uncomfortable). If you have problems like carpal tunnel syndrome you might need to get creative with your control setup, particularly where you bind your spamming skills.\n(World) Art style is good, imo. This is of course subjective but I personally liked the artstyle for the world in this game. The game is very clearly heavily inspired by the Diablo series, most notably Diablo 3. If you have played that game you will no doubt find many of the areas around the world and even some enemies to be quite familiar. And I don't view this as a negative, as I did like Diablo 3 and in general I think the influence it seems to have had on this game's art direction is a positive one.\nMy complaint on the art style would be that I'm not a great fan of the gender-locked classes, although I can understand it being done most likely on budget concerns. However adding gender options in the future is definitely a way this game could be improved upon. I'm especially not a big fan of my favorite class to play, the Cannoneer, being a Loli (little anime girl). The character in this particular game is not as offensive or perverted as they can get though, so it wasn't a deal breaker for me, but I'd still have preferred an alternative.\nIt's a good candidate if you're looking for some mindless entertainment when you're tired.\nThe Bad:\nThe game is far too easy for basically the entirity of the leveling phase, and the only real challenge comes when you reach max level and begin running Hell difficulty dungeons with the blues you were leveling with. To me this is bad pacing, plain and simple. A tutorial is something that should last maybe 10, 20, 30 minutes. Maybe an hour or two if your game is really complex. But let's be honest, this is an MMO that plays very much like Diablo 3 or a moba/dota-style game. The complexity found here is not exactly on the level of Chess. So for you to tell me that the entire leveling process up to max level is a 15 to 20+ hour tutorial or "learning phase" can only come across as an insult. I know this is par for the course for MMOs to have stupidly easy leveling content, but it's still bad game design in my honest opinion.\nIf you want my advice, skip parts of a zone when you get the chance to move on to the next zone, and tackle dungeons you don't really have proper gear for and are the minimum required level, and you might find a reasonably challenging and fun experience with the game.\nThe PvP is completely lackluster. Devilian form PVP has you spamming one ability to generate your resource bar and another to consume it, with another 3 or 4 cooldown-based abilities. As you might imagine this combined with lock on targetting on most abilities leaves very little room for creativity and a relatively low skill ceiling. They only started testing regular-form PvP in the last closed beta, about 3 weeks prior to launch, and the kindest way I can describe what was presented to us is that it was an unbalanced mess. Some changes were made since then but frankly I didn't feel a drive to play on the Open Beta prior to release so I can't really say if I would deem the current state playable. From reading the changes made at that time, I do believe it would be significantly better, but I would caution you to know going in that it is a work in progress. But they do seem to be taking player feedback and making efforts to balance that game mode, so that's good.\nEnemy variety is greatly lacking. Even bosses are reskinned and copy pasted across several encounters. Then see them again for the Heroic+Hell versions!\nVoice acting was few and far between, and when it was present it sometimes may have been better absent. I don't know if they are planning to add any new and hopefully better voice acted lines to the game, but in the Alpha and Beta stages it definitely left room for improvement. I grew to absolutely hate the Warehouse Manager and the generic injured soldier quest-giver NPC that was all over the place for their annoying, often-repeated (one or two) lines. Disable voices or get used to hearing "cough cough cough.. GOT TO STOP THEM!" and "It's easier to lose things than to find them, don't forget that!" (This would also disable other slightly less annoying NPCs as well as your own character voices..)\nThe Ugly:\nBy far my biggest problem with the game was the absolutely dreadful, painfully generic, and obnoxiously repetitive questing. Played WoW or one of the many MMOs like it? Remember how much FUN all those "kill x," "gather y," and "interact with z" quests used to be? Well for your sake I hope you found them fun, because that's pretty much all that questing in this game has to offer. And you'll be doing quite a lot of it. Have fun!! (The level of sarcasm herein should be smacking you over the head).\nThe questionable\nThe max level grind? You might want to look for a second opinion here. This is the one subject where I don't necessarily feel confident offering a conclusive assessment in due to limited exposure to it. From what I saw in the Beta, it was possible to obtain at least entry-level purple (heroic) gear from dungeon through a somewhat reasonable random drop chance, although only from hell+3 dungeons. However I'm not entirely sure how you go about getting the real top tier gear. The only way I saw was collecting tokens via daily quests, which would have taken a very long time to get a single item, which would then have largely random properties.\nConclusion The game is fairly decent. Definitely not without flaws, but if you enjoy MMOs or did in the past, this one may offer enough with its more interesting combat to warrant giving it a try. And it's free to play with a reasonable download size, so I don't see any blatant reason to not recommend at least trying it.","December 10, 2015","true","1.0"," 258 of 317 people (81%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","81","258","317","19","27"

Take a Diablo 3/Torchlight type of game and mix in games like World of Craft and this is what you get.\n\nThere are 4 classes in total at the moment.\n1.  Evoker - female mage (range with magic)\n2.  Cannoneer - female gunner (range with guns)\n3.  Shadowhunter - male melee (melee/range hybrid)(looks like someone out of Castlevania)\n4.  Berserker - male melee (wields two 1h swords)\n\nEach class has 3 different specializations that you can put ability points into.  You gain 1 ability point per level once you reach level 10.  You can make a pure 1 spec build or dip points into all 3 specs and make a hybrid.  There's nothing holding you back if you'd like to try things out and have fun with this specialization tree.  Respecialization (respec) is completely free and you can do it as many times and as often as you like.\n\nMax level as of this writing is lvl 52.  After about 60 hours I've did ALL the quests available, multiple PvP sessions and have completed the tier 1 PvE set.  There are a total of 3 tiers at the moment.  Tier 1 is the Falling Star set which is blue (rare) equipment.  The next set tier 2 is the Butchery set which is epic (purple) and the final set tier 3 is the Tragedy set and it too is epic (purple).  When reaching max level 52 the grind starts.  Grinding for tokens to complete tier 2 and/or 3 and get gems to socket your gear.\n\nThere is PvP in the game and it's set up like a MOBO (think DOTA).  You pick a lane, capture and hold it while killing off the enemy players.  At the moment it seems very range friendly and the melee classes just feel undesired.  You can either play as your human form and use the skills you've acquired or take on your specific Devilian form.\n\nDevilian form is like your Super Saiyen and when you go Devilian you are stronger, faster and harder to kill.  Very fun aspect of the game.  You can either use this in PvP or in PvE.  In PvE you get devil orbs which will help fill your Devilian meter.  Once full you can morph into Devilian form and wreck havok!\n\nThere are over 20 dungeons and all are extremely fast paced.  Each dungeon shouldn't take you 10 mins to complete.  Once you hit max level you can queue up for Heroic versions of the dungeons you've did while leveling and once you feel comfortable with that difficulty you can advance to Hell difficulty.  Each difficulty whether it be Normal, Heroic or Hell has 3 tiers and are named +1, +2 or +3.  Each of these +1 are more difficult by means of monster health and how much damage they do to you, but the benefit is more loot!\n\nThe game is free to play and you can enjoy the whole game without paying a dime, but if you choose to support the game you can pay for extra bag space, more xp, more gold, different types of mounts (they give you one free) and cosmetics.  Nothing overpowering makes this a pay to win title and should be classified as a pay for convenience.  Other conveniences are an auto run feature that allows you to kick back and let your character run to either the quest giver or the objectives.  I found this nice.  You can sit back and take a drink or get your smoke on for a min.  There are fast travel nodes all over the world too.  So if you don't feel up to traversing the world to get to the other side of it you can use this, but with payment of in game gold.\n\nThe major town hub isn't overpopulated, but has a lot of people there doing quests, the auction house, warehouse (store more stuff outside your bag inventory), chat and enchanting gear.  There are still two major continents that have yet to be opened up and the level cap is supposed to increase by the 1st quarter of 2016.  There are still 3 more tiers of gear and Raids to be implemented as well.\n\nThere's also a Paragon system once you reach end game level cap.  Meaning, once you reach level 52 you can no longer gain any more levels, but instead the experience you gained can be dumped into another set of proficiencies like the Paragon sytem Diablo 3 has.  When dumping points into this system all your characters will share extended health, more gold per kill, more xp per kill, more damage toward bosses and so forth.  The system still needs some work and shouldn't be bound to all your characters, but at least all that precious xp is wasted!\n\nLastly, there's a tower to test your skills at and it opens up around level 25ish called the Abyssal Tower.  In this tower you climb up floors of non stop enemies and bosses until you reach the top floor at 100.  As you get better gear and respec your character to fine tune him you will ascend higher into the tower.  You will get XP for your Devilian form in doing this and making yourself even stronger.  You can only do this tower once a day so make sure you do it for it's totally worth it.  There's even a leaders board for this tower for some friendly competition.\n\nAs it stands Devilian was extremely great and I very much enjoyed my 60 hours of gameplay, but once I hit max level I've seemed to hit a brick wall.  Due to Devilian being content starved either you grind out endgame mats (which isn't endgame yet due to not complete) or do countless PvP for PvP gear.\n\nIf you enjoy Diablo, Torchlight, Grim Dawn, Path of Exile with MMO characteristics like World of Warcraft or Rift you will thoroughly enjoy this.

I would STAY AWAY from this title.\n\nDue to several changes this game is getting the same vibe as Archeage. Every new patch makes this game more pay2win and every new player has a higher wall to climb. Theyve changed ingredients from free to trade to bind on pickup, which means you can only get them from the store for money or aquire a few a day by doing daily quests.\n\nIt also has those lottery boxes like archeage, it contains most of the stuff to let you gear up quickly in the endgame, just hope you get the good rolls on it, or suffer and buy more (which is more likely).\n\nThere is also the problem of a core playerbase who got most or all endgame gear before several changes came along making it 7-10 times as hard to get. Also a few things more which im not allowed to say happened which made that starting playerbase frightingly powerful.\n\nBecause of this getting a high rank in the abyssal tower is impossible for new players.\n\nLast but not least, because of these awkward changes and many problems not being solved at a adequate speed the population is dropping fast. So if there arent any good changes soon, this game will die a quick and silent death and became another smear on the reputation of Trion (yes im also still sore from Archeage).\n\nTL:DR\nFun gameplay, bad pay2winfaster endgame, newcomers cant compete","December 25, 2015","false","84.6"," 139 of 163 people (85%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","85","139","163","5","10"

Got 1 toon to lvl52 (max) and one to lvl 40. Combat is fun and fast, and I would expect this from the same people who made Tera. You get 24 spaces in your inventory and trust me you're going to need a lot more, which will cost you real money.  And even if you get Patron (which is a sub) you still have to play 5 days to get 15 log in points just to buy 8 inventory spaces, red flag #2.\n\nMaking gold was very slow at the beginning but I heard it was much easier in higher levels.  Kinda true but everything costs more, you need to upgrade everything to progress in end game and that all costs in game gold.  With Patron you can buy and sell on the auction house, except there's no money to be made or never enough, which forces you to buy dex from Trion to sell in game for gold - red flag #3.\n\nThe drop rate for butchery gear (2nd highest in game) is really low unless you make pre-made parties of 3 and enter, don't look for parties you will never get a piece.  You will also need gems, runes etc.. so it's grinding the SAME dungeons over and over.\n\nHop on the gear treadmill 'cause it going to be a long ride, strictly for them to make more money.

The music is quite nice as well, the enemies are quite well designed - bosses especially. The NPC's repeat the same thing when you talk to them, annoying but you tune it out eventually. It's also got a nice story to go alongside it that even has a bit of side story here and there.\n\nCharacter skill system is nice, you're able to reset points freely so you can try out different skills as you want to mix things up. There's 3 catergories you can choose from each with skills and bonuses towards them, as you spend more points in each one that unlocks more skills and bonuses.\n\nThere are some bugs/glitches here and there but it's early days, it's not been out long but it's pretty stable for the most part.\n\nContrary to popular belief, it is in no way pay to win. There is an in-game store, yes, but it only has the following: 2 mounts, some pets, cosmetic items, exp/gold boosts, inventory/character/warehouse slot increases, appearance/rename changes. Overall, nothing that constitutes as pay to win. Leveling isn't even that difficult really, it slows down as is  the case with any MMO but that's common and you can just grind out dungeons or complete the quests.\n\nOverall, it's nice to see this type of MMO again. It's early on so give it a try and if it's not your cup of tea then leave it and come back after some updates or just don't play it.

I've just reached end-game content.\n\nGame OutlineThere are 4 classes, each with a fixed gender and appearance. You can perform minor customizations, like choosing slightly different eye shapes or hairdos, but when you're zoomed out to actually play the game, there's not much visual difference between any two players of the same class.\nEach class has its own skill tree. Each skill tree is broken up into 3 sub-trees, just like WoW used to have. There are no healing or tanking specs, so your choices are between 3 different DPS specs. Once people get the theorycrafting fleshed out, it's highly likely that there will be one or two cookie-cutter builds for each class.\nDevilian form is a super-powered form a class. It comes with fewer abilities than your normal class. Some forms of PvP take place only in Devilian form. Outside of that, you have to kill monsters to fill a gauge. Once the gauge is sufficiently full, you can enter Devilian form for a short time.\nThere's the persistent world, which is broken up into instanced zones. You can switch between instances of any zone.\nThere are instanced dungeons. You can either solo a dungeon or go at it with a group of up to 2 other players. If you want to run a dungeon with a party but don't have any friends online, there's a dungeon finder tool that will match you with other players. While leveling, you encounter a new dungeon every level or two from level 20 all the way up to the level cap at level 52.\nThere's also PvP. There's world PvP events, PvP world zone instances, 3v3 arenas, 20v20 arenas, and guild vs. guild PvP. There doesn't seem to be much interest in PvP. 3v3 arenas have really long queue times. I haven't even managed to get into a 20v20 because the queue time is so long.\nNow that we’ve covered the basics of what the game covers, I'll be breaking this review up into 3 parts: The Leveling Process, End-game, and Everything Else.\n\nThe Leveling Process:You gain levels by killing monsters, doing quests, or killing other players.\n\nLike I mentioned earlier, I haven't done much PvP because there's just not that much interest in it. The classes aren't well-balanced, so anyone not playing the Evoker will have a bad time.\nThe quest system is about as basic as it can get. You either kill things, gather things, or interact with objects, like destroying shacks or putting out fires. There are a lot of quests, and there's virtually no differentiation between any of them. The quest text is less than engaging. I'm not even sure what the story of the game is since I skipped all the quest text after about level 3.\nAs with just about every other ARPG ever made, you'll spend the lionshare of your time killing monsters. Lot of monsters. You'll do it while questing and while dungeoning. Even in some forms of PvP, you'll still kill monsters along the way. Killing monsters is fulfilling. They fly all over the place when they die, like what happens in D3.\nEnd-game:Once you've hit the level cap of 52, the game starts to narrow in focus.\n\nThere’s a D3 type Paragon leveling system which lets you spend experience past the level cap of 52 on a number of different areas. You can increase the XP you generate in certain areas of the game; you can increase the gold you gain; you can improve your DPS. Unlike D3, I like that they’ve expanded the end-game leveling system past combat stats.\n\nFor PvM content, you have the choice between doing four dungeons, one "Archdevil" dungeon of greater difficulty, guild dungeons, daily quests, a tower climbing type dungeon, and world PvM.\n\nDungeons are limited to 4 different end-game dungeons and can be completed either solo or with a party of up to two other players. Each dungeon is static. Each takes less than 10 minutes to complete. There's no Diablo-type random maps. When you run one dungeon once, you've seen all there is to see of that dungeon. There is no limit to the number of regular dungeons you can do per day, which is a good thing since you'll have to grind the hell out of them to get your end-game gear.\n\nArchdevil dungeons allow two attempts per day. Guild dungeons and the tower dungeon allow for one attempt per day. Guild dungeons allow nearly a dozen players to participate. The tower dungeon contains multiple floors. Each floor you progress to is more difficult than the last. You are limited to doing 10 floors per day.\n\nWorld PvM is kind of a mixed bag. There are world bosses that need killing, but they don’t reward much in the way of loot to anyone but the top 2 or 3 players based on damage done and number of deaths. If you die once or twice, you might as well just leave. There are also special areas where you can group with friends to kill elite monsters. Some of these areas also allow for PvP, which makes for a unique experience of killing monsters and players at the same time. This is one of the few areas of the game that I feel really strikes a good balance between PvM and PvP.\n\nAs far as dedicated PvP goes, I have very little experience because there's really not much engagement from the player-base. Devilian form PvP gets stale quickly. Each class's Devilian form has 5 basic abilities with very little depth.\n\nEverything Else:Despite what you may have heard, the game isn't Pay 2 Win. The only things I've seen that really upset people are the limited release vanity items and mounts. Most of the store is devoted to selling you glasses, wings, or clothing. Nothing in the store has stats on it, so there's no P2W gear. There are also buffs you can purchase that increase XP, gold drops, and the chance for better dungeon drops. Other than that, just about everything else you can buy in the store can be purchased with currency you earn in-game. It will, however, take a while to buy most of that stuff without shelling out real world currency. It's for this reason that I find this game to fall squarely into the Pay 4 Convenience category of Free 2 Play games.\n\nLike many Eastern F2P games, there are a lot of subsystems to mess with. Most of them just add to the grindy tedium of the game. There’s the Talisman system, which is similar to the card collecting smartphone apps. The cards give you stats. You can equip up to 5 cards. It’s horribly grindy and less than fun unless you like digital card collecting. There’s an equally tedious gear socket/gemming system. A system to permanently increase your elemental resistances which requires a lot of grinding for reagents. You get the idea. It’s all minutiae, and it doesn’t add much to the game other than to give you a reason to keep grinding the same 4 dungeons over and over again.\n\n\nThe bottom line:Whether you spend real money on the game or not, if you like grindy games with lots of (generally tedious) depth, you’ll find a lot to like in this game.\n\nIf you play games for the art and scenery, you’ll enjoy the leveling process. The monster models and environment are well-made. After you hit max level, this kind of goes out the window since most of your time will be spent in the same 4 dungeons for hours upon hours.\n\nIf you’re looking for a game with an epic story and deep lore, you should look elsewhere. The quest text is well translated as far as grammar and syntax are concerned, but it feels like it’s missing flavor. A lot of the text reads like the journal of a scientific researcher. Facts abound, but there’s no soul in that text.\n\nIn totality, the game is at least worth trying. It’s visually engaging and fun, at least while you’re leveling.\n\nRatings:Leveling: 8/10\nEnd-game: 6/10","December 18, 2015","true","55.3"," 76 of 99 people (77%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","77","76","99","5","4"

Devilian was originally created in Korea as a Diablo clone that was its original intention and for people saying "it looks too much like Diablo" you're correct... it's supposed to. To finally have cleared that up Devilian is an ARPG-MMO (Action Role Playing Game - Massively Multiplayer Online), it is grindy yes... it will continue to be grindy yes... and no it won't stray away from being grindy, if you don't want something so grindy I'd recommend neopets I hear it's pretty cute. Although Devilian is no where near perfect it does damn good at its job of creating a fun and immersive user experience. The way the dungeons and quests flow seemlessly makes for a long but enjoyable leveling experience. I've played Devilian now for 300+ hours in the Alpha/BETA and now Live with a little experience playing the original version in Korea while I was on Holiday a few years back visitng a close friend!

I played off of Steam. Okay, lets get this going.\nTrion is somewhat known for crushing games that showed great promise. Defiance went out with a whimper, with feint echos of crickets. Rift turned into a decent F2P to a pay to win. (And you literally have to buy certain gear slots. Earrings.)Trove has massive lag issues, and is riddled with bugs. Archeage... well.. it's Archeage. That's nuff' said.\n\nTL;DR It sucks. Crappily designed F2P. Not worth the gigs.\n\n\nI was hoping Devilian would be the redemption for Trion. Maybe they were ready to pump out a game that wasn't a huge plea of 'help we're dying' so I checked it out. The graphics are outdated, which I can handle. Little to no voice acting, and what voice acting there is, it's awful. Which I can handle. The gameplay is clunky and lazy. Some abilities simply don't work. There's no sure-fire way to level your devilian. It's all RNG. So the game feels like a cheap korean grinder as far as combat at this point.  Then we start getting into the fremium stuff. Bag slots, character slots, etc. Typical stuff. Well they released a new class; Tempest. I read the patch notes and it seemed pretty cool. So I log into the game to make one, and I only had 2 character slots. which were both reserved by a couple of characters that I've put a bit of time into. But I REALLY wanted to try the tempest and see if maybe it would be redemption points. So, I thought on it.. thought on it.. and thought on it. I came back in and deleted my least favorite of the 2 in order to create a tempest. And. Guess. What. To play Tempest, you're required to purchase the class. With. Money. Any MMORPG that forces you to BUY classes is not one worth the storage space. It's the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t F2P style ever. Cosmetics, great. Slots, cool. Mounts, sure.

When you get max lvl is where all the microtranactions come into play making your toons stronger altho you can get everything in game it just takes a very long time grinding it all out.\n-Also on the part of it being free to play you cant talk in any chats but for guild/party if your free to play they make you pay to talk in chats meaning u either have to buy something from the market place or buy a monthly pass.\n-End game is very very very grindy (5 hours of farming hell modes atm with no epic drops) since they reduced the item drop rate it made it about impossable to get epics to drop now. Tho there is 4 different modes to hell +0 +1 +2 +3, +3 being the higher drop rate but you cant get into anything +1 or higher without having atleast a few epics unless u pay gold to a stronger player to run you in +3 and hope to get a drop (which you dont always get gear for your class its mostly for other classes).\n-You can only have 3 players to a party there is no real tanks or healers altho the zerker can tank and the envoker can heal it dont always work cause the envoker cant heal none stop as thier heal has a cd.\n-Also you have to pay to have more inventory slots as well they only give u about 24 inventory slots for free and make you pay for the rest.\n\nBut with all that said the overall game is good to a certin degree but is very grindy at end game like a said and the way the drop rate is im figureing it will take a few days of 8 hours or more per day just to finish out your first set of epics. Tho gettin to make lvl (52 being max lvl atm) doesnt take long at all and you can be power lvled from stronger players.\nBut any how im done with this review and im giving it a thumbs down only cause of the huge amount of grinding it takes after reaching max lvl and seeing 0 drops after 6 hours of farming instances none stop. But if you want a game to play just to pass time then this is the game to go to even tho there is no real storyline to it the lvling to 52 was pretty fun and would do it again if they change the way the game is atm.

User reviews are not so good but i saw players saying it is not P2W and some other positive comments, and we liked art of it so we decided to give it a shot. It was fine at the beggining even tho nothing special with quests -boring as most other MMOs. So i didnt bother and just focused on leveling to see end game. After playing it for 1 week yesterday i've hit level 50 with my main and level 30 with my alt, top level is 54.\n\nToday it was a fail patch day, 1-2 hours maintenance took 24 hours. I got a compensation mail including 50 archgemstones -only in game currency that you can buy a mount for free as i got, and it takes long to buy one as it seems. I opened game with my alt so i received compensation mail with my alt and i couldnt transfer it to my main bcs it was bound.. It was account wide mail and i didnt receive it with my main. I said anyways i can obtain mount on my alt later when i have enough currency and share it with my main. But WTF? It says "bind on pick up" on mounts in archgemstone shop.. I thought maybe bcs it is for free and for the first time i checked cash shop; on ALL items it writes "bind on pick up". Seriously; i will pay cash to get a mount or anything and i will not be able to share it with my other char in same server? They really expect you to pay 2 times for same mount LOL! Not just mount; same for all cash shop items. What a crap system!\n\nThen i joined daily Abyssal Tower to level up my alt. I knew XP amount we need to level up was going to be increased with this patch. But WTF? Yesterday i got almost 1,5 levels on same floors but today it didn't even move 20% on XP bar.. You must be kidding me! If i would start to play this game 1 week earlier i was gonna have two top level chars and now i will have to waste 5-6 times more hours to hit level cap?\n\nI got mad and wanted to ask players if this game is worth to give it a try, for the first time wanted to use a megaphone which they give many as gift. It said "free accounts can't use megaphone" WTF? why did i receive so many megaphones as gift if i am not going to be able to use any?\n\nThat moment i decided to quit game and instead of feeling sorry for my 10 days, i feel good for not wasting more time for this crap. All free to play games have a cash shop and there is not anything wrong with it, they need to make money. But, to make people pay for it, you have to make them like the game first. I just played 10 days and i was hoping to see end game but i couldn't bear with this crap cash shop system already. Who knows what other money traps were on the way at end game.\n\nPeople who read comments before downloading a game; don't believe people who say this game is not P2W or P2P. I think they have never seen a F2P game before. I have no idea how it was going to be at end game but if a game's hands are in your pocket just for sending a post on server with a megaphone, for trading with other players and for selling items in auction house; NO SIR that game has nothing to do with F2P!\n\n\nPros\n\n*Art is good\n*Devilian transform is MEH but OK\n*They give you a free mount -with lowest stats ofc\n\nCons\n\n*It is not F2P! You can only play it like a demo with a free account, you can't even trade with your friend.\n*Not any original idea, same stuff with almost all MMOs\n*Ridiculous cash shop system, they expect you to buy everything separately for each char\n*Not enough players, sometimes it takes 25-30 mins to join a PvP match\n\n\nConclusion; it could be a nice game if it had a better cash shop system and if it wouldnt ask you to pay cash for simple stuff like trading with players and using megaphones on server chat. But in this state, this game is just a money trap and there are many other games which offer same fun for less money or even for free.","April 15","false","99.3"," 24 of 28 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","24","28","3","7"

The game isn't terrible by any stretch, and if you find yourself burnt out on other ARPGs, then sure this might be up your alley.\n\nBut Devilian's flaws aren't in its presentation or even in how it tries to mix up the formula. The meat of the game, the combat, feels fairly clunky. Skills feel robotic and just lack the flow that you'd find in other games of the genre. The customization options are weak, the classes are unoriginal, and even the skills feel a little too "inspired" by the games that came before it.\n\nOn the positive note though, the "MMO" feel of the game does create a feeling of living in a populated world, and feels reminiscent of classics like Mu online. This both plays to the game's strength, but also caters to its weaknesses by forcing incredibly quick respawn timers on quest mobs.\n\nIt's a shame, because I was legitimately looking forward to this game.","December 10, 2015","false","1.4"," 237 of 398 people (60%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","60","237","398","16","21"

I pressed the play button and it opened the Glyph launcher. I logged in and changed my Region to EU, because somehow it was set to US and it started to download the whole damn game again. So you end up with 2 copies of the game on your hdd. There is a way to work around that by renaming the game folder which i did. Finally i could play the game and when i wanted to start it the next day Steam gave me an error and started downloading again... So, i deleted the game on Steam, downloaded Glyph launcher and the game again. At least that worked as intended and that is why my play time on Steam is so low.\n\nThis game is free to play, but when you start you have a limited account. Limited account basically means that some basic MMO features are hidden behind a (small) paywall. With a limited account you can not whisper to strangers(only to friends), you can not sell items on the auction house, you can not initiate trades, not able to use megaphones(kind of like a global chat) and some other stuff. To verify that you are a human and the owner of the account they want you to make a purchase on any Trion game. Only then your account limitation is gone. This is a ridiculous way of forcing players to pay for their product(s) and totally anti-consumer. They limit the player experience unless you pay and in a thread on the forums someone from their team said that they want to give players the best experience possible. What a joke.\n\nSo, about 3 days ago there was a server restart. After the server came back up we lost our quest progress and items from a whole day. Big rollback. Also, people who bought stuff from the shop with real money lost their stuff. It took them a while to give us some compensation items and xp boost, but the quest progress was gone. I had to do the same quests again to get to the point where i left before the restart which was a lot. The next day they announced another server restart and said it would take 20 minutes. After 2 hours the server was still not up and if i remember correctly it took about 4 hours at the end. Then not even a day later there was a maintenance of 4 hours. Last night they announced another downtime. Almost 18 hours have passed now and the server is still not up. This is not an ARPG, this is a downtime simulator. Trion is known for server issues and it looks like they never learn. If you ever played Trove before then you know what i am talking about.","December 16, 2015","false","10.1"," 53 of 88 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","53","88","0","7"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KAraragi/recommended/407510/","KAraragi","LQW","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KAraragi/","52 products in account","Alright guys i'm going to go into a pretty detailed review of what I think Devilian is worth since I have not seen anyone do a decent review yet.\nI have played 200 hours in the past 2 weeks and have reached end-game content and will give you my opinion on the game.  Please enjoy.\n\n\nPros:\n-There are literally no bots farming/gathering materials ever.  I have been playing and probably have seen ONE person just standing there probably with some type of mouse macro just killing useless mobs.  Mobs in the game don't give much at all, nearly nothing.  You obtain majority of the materials from dungeons.\n-Combat is awesome, it's fluid with a top-down camera similar to PoE and the Diablo series\n-Non-Tab targeting of course, it's an Action RPG with MMO aspects\n-It's extremely easy to learn how to play\n-If you want certain costumes but don't want to pay money, you can purchase in-game credits via gold legally.  There is a system called "DEX" (Devilian credits) which is an item you purchase from someone for gold, and when you use it it will add real world funds/credits to your account for use in the marketplace (cash shop).\n-Content is actually difficult end game! Even if you have the best equipment you may not be able to clear the final boss of the Archdevil dungeons (3 man raid).  It is extremely mechanical and needs skill as the boss has certain 1 shot mechanics and multiple boss phases depending on his life total.\n-3 skill trees per class so you can fine tune your build to your style.\n-Skill resets are FREE.  You do not have to do anything to reset them, you just click the button and it will refund all your points for you to experiment with.\n-Dungeon party system is available and although may not be that great for early on level dungeons (nobody does them really), it is great for finding your level cap dungeons (instant queue nearly).\n-There are 3 people per party for regular dungeons and Archdevil dungeons (which are insanely hard, mechanically & gear wise)\n-Raid dungeons will be available in the future with 9 man raids\n-Guilds are available with benefits for being in the guild (Guild dungeons, guild daily quest, rewards only obtained via guild)\n-PvP available (3v3 and 20v20 battlegrounds)\n-Via daily quests and log-in rewards a free to play player can be just as strong as anyone else.  (Currently near the top of the leaderboard for my class and haven't paid anything except to validate my account)\n-Validating account (Could be a pro or con?).  You need to use 5 dollars in the marketplace (Cash shop) and make a purchase before your account is validated.  If you have played Archeage or Rift your account is already validated.  It is a ONE time thing for your TRION account.  This is why there are no botters in the game.  Only mail bots that send you occasional garbage are present.\n-Nothing is set behind a paywall, you can be very successful in the game as a free to play character\n\nCons:\n-Currently only 4 classes. Cannonner, Evoker (Mage), Shadowhunter (Rogue), Berserker (Warrior).  There is a 5th class scheduled to be released sometime later, Deathscythe.\n-Classes are genderlocked (why?).. Not that big of a deal for me but may be for some players\n-5 dollar purchase of a marketplace item must be made before your account is validated.\n-Non validated accounts are not able to initiate a trade with other players.  The other player MUST trade YOU first.  Trading is still available though.\n-Non validated accounts are not able to sell items on the auction house but are able to purchase.\n-Can be repetitive at times, grinding for gear in dungeons and what not but every F2P MMO has some aspect of that.\n\n\nMy review will be futher updated later! Thank you for reading up to this point. I can answer further questions about the game or mechanics of the game if needed.  Please don't hesitate to ask, thanks!","January 7","true","340.8"," 21 of 30 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","21","30","0","1"

Things may have changed. Take this with a grain of salt.\n\nI haven't played for long enough to judge this game entirely, but right now, I think I have a bit of a good idea.\n\nDevilian is both an MMO, and a dungeon crawler. Pretty much take WoW and take Diablo/Path of Exile, mash them together, add a bit of evil, you have Devilian. One of the main features, is that you are part human and part demon. Where the title comes from. You can briefly turn into your 'Devilian form" or, "Awakened Devilian form". This makes you much for powerful, to deal with the gigantic awe inspiring demons and devils you will come across in your travels.\n\nPros:\n-Decent graphics. Devilian looks pretty decent, especially for an MMO. My average end PC gets about 50-60 FPS on medium graphics settings.\n-Story. So far, the story seems to be quite interesting. I suppose I will have to wait until later to make a final judgement upon it.\n-Enjoyable gameplay, the gameplay in Devlian seems to be fun. Not incredibly repetitive or click on that dude and watch your character murder them!\n-Cool idea. I found the Devilian form that you can change into for a short time to aid you in destroying the creatures you come across to be a cool idea.\n\nCons:\n-Controls can be a bit fiddly at times.\n-Character creation is very linear. Compared to RIFT, there are barely any creation options. The classes even have forced  gender. Mage is forced female.\n-Incredibly overly implied boob physics. The login screen even has them. When you stand still they are there. No doubt most people appreciate it.. but.. tone it down a little?\n\nAfter all, Devilian DID just release, bugs need to be ironed out. It's free, you may as well give it a try.\n\nEDIT: I have heard of the account wipe issues, however, I have not experienced one. Just be warned.","December 11, 2015","true","22.1"," 63 of 107 people (59%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","59","63","107","4","3"

Laggy servers, delayed patches and a staff that needs days and weeks to answer to our tickets.\n\nThe game is some sort of fine. I'd say it's catchy if you choose the class really takes your mind. There are 4 simple classes: Berserker (mostly associated as a tank or melee dps), Shadowhunter (sort of an assassin/rogue or however you may know it from other games), Evoker (the classic mage with an aoe heal and a magic shield) and the Canonneer (just a Ranger with a gun, a big badass gun). They all are able to solo some content of the game, there is room for all of them in others parties.\n\nJust take the class you'd really enjoy to play and you should be fine!

The sounds are ripped from diablo, not even kidding the sound of an item dropping is identical as in they must have used the same sound file. The levels are just a path to a boss, no exploring in side quests to discover just go from point A to point B kill boss repeat.\n\nIt might be interesting for an hour or so just because you want to see more of the dungen art, but if you dont have any interest in just playing diablo with better gfx then move along.\n\n\nPS If the dev happen to read any of these reviews: Maybe stop putting all women in high heels. When i pick up an item called "standar boots" or anything labeled armor i dont expect that it will look like something from a victorias secret catalog. I feel sorry for the great artists you had working on this project.

Combat is an effervescent bloodbath broken by intermittent downtime while leveling, while the endgame is a, thankfully, endless dungeon crawl interspersed with chaotic PvP. Making it rain in-game currency will give your account VIP treatment but it’s not necessary to experience every avenue of gameplay. Had it released three years ago in North America, Devilian would have snagged players anticipating Diablo 3 and been a widespread success.

Anyone that had a ton of steam cash was able to purchase hundreds of these and then use the money they get from that to skyrocket to the top of the ranks. I stopped playing once their cheap servers began lagging to a point where you were unable to even get fully through a dungeon without either lagging and dying, or lagging completely out of the game and having the game crash. Oh there is also the fact that the only endgame content that they offered were farming points in certain areas called Infinite Hunting Grounds. It was somewhat manageable to compete with the other large clans because you were able to run around solo and the multiple other servers and collect points for your guild without having to run into  a massive group of 25k+ player score (over 20k is usually end game gear with decent stats). The developers then decided to make it so you could only farm and turn in points for your guild on ONE SINGLE CHANNEL! Are you kidding me? This is what fully made me quit playing this game and I do not intend on going back. Save yourselves the time and agony and skip over this game...","February 27","false","213.0"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

Comparing to those alternatives the MMO is much more fleshed out than Marvel Heroes and combat is on par is Path of Exile (perhaps a bit better). There are currently only 4 classes though a 5th is on the horizon.\n\nAction is solid and fast, enemies die with just the right attacks, they don't instantly die with basic attacks but they don't stick around too long either. Skill Trees are customizable and end-game allows for more proficiencies. Overall a very solid ARPG with MMO elements on top.\n\nIN DEPTH ON F2P:\nIt is F2P, with cosmetics and xp/gold boost in the marketplace. There is an optional subscription perk called Patron that gives no real gameplay benefits, but even it can be purchased with in game gold. You must expand your inventory with store bought items like many F2P MMO's though it is cheaper than many (such as GW2) to do so. Ovreall a very fair business model.\n\nNOTE ON LAUNCH HISTORY:\nThere was an issue with a EU server where many players lost a few hours of progress. It took a couple of days but Trion has since provided gear and other benefits to those affected. I'd like to point out that this happens even to games that did not just launch. I bought the Mk III pack ($100 for all heroes and storage and gems) in Marvel Heroes and after using the blender (to get more costumes) the server went down and everyone lost some game progress. I lost all the costumes and no one was compensated. Gazillian (the developer) is more well regarded by it's playerbase than Trion seems to be, as the backlash was negligable.\n\nSUMMARY\nI have enjoyed my time so far with Devilian, both as a solid ARPG game experience and with nice MMO features (guild raids, guild wars, 20v20 pvp, etc.) as a bonus. If you see the current "mixed" reviews and are cautious, give it a try. It's free and will only cost you a bit of time if you end up not liking it.","December 18, 2015","true","32.8"," 18 of 29 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","18","29","2","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sarnox/recommended/407510/","sarnox","Nox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sarnox/","254 products in account","The core concept of fusing aRPG with mmo-styled progression works well in theory, but Devilian fell short in its execution.\n\nLet me first say that I have played the game extensively for the last week and with some luck and hard work gotten into end-game (partial tragedy). Many of the issues that other reviewers have mentioned (gender-locked, poor optimization, restricted trading) are apparent, but not game-breaking and can easily be brushed off with the fact that the gameplay is very satisfying. If you give the game a chance the overall leveling experience is embellished by a combat that is pleasing, fluid, and fast paced for an mmo. The game reminded me of why I enjoy top down aRPGs that give a player control of the surrounding space more than classical mmos where everything is homing and boils down to cooldown rotations. Needless to say I had fun, and didn't feel the need to pay2win beyond unlocking the marketplace.\n\n\nHowever, at the time of this review the hardest and final dungeon (agony device) illustrates a fundamental problem with this game. I'll use it to give you a sense of what to expect from the game in the long-run.\n\nBy design you need gear from that dungeon to be able to farm that content quickly and efficiently. If you've just recently hit that progression ceiling your only options are as follows:\n\n1. Try your best to play skillfully and slowly go through the dungeon at a snails pace.\n\n2. Spend days of time grinding low level content to amass gold/materials to add #numbers to your vertical progression of resistances/artifacts/talismans (all de facto gold sinks).\n\n3. Pull out the cc to accelerate the above or trade $$ for in-game gold and pay other players to carry you through the dungeon.\n\nPoint one quickly becomes moot because of the constant server issues the game has. Any prolonged gaming/dungeon session will be on a constant timer before you disconnect, lag rubber-band into death, or straight up have the client crash on you. Mind you this usually happens well over a dozen times an hour during heavy server load and is an acknowledged problem that has persisted for a while.\n\nAs for gearing up you can guess how stale and unappealing the alternatives are.\nEven without turning into credit card heroes, most players at this point still opt to grind gold and have others play the content for them in the form of carry runs while they hope RNG blesses them with some drops. This seems to be a recurring theme with almost all of the end-game content, which addresses another issue: the lack of content.\n\nFor a game with so many different vertical progression components that all serve to give you the illusory sense of depth of gearing up, it's amazing how little actual content it has to offer. You will be rolling the same handful of dungeons/areas in end-game to no avail. There simply isn't anything really except for the final dungeon and daily dungeon (agony and abyssal) to challenge yourself with - both of which can only be accessed once and twice respectively a day.\n\n\nSo what does the game have in store for the future?\nThe korean servers closed months ago, so there is no future development going on in the backpipe and Trion plans to slow-roll the remaining few dungeons they have in store which will be more of the same: lots of face planting into gear-checks and endless forms of vertical progression that will funnel you more and more into what bad f2p mmos are despised for.\n\nPvP can be fun at times, but for the most part due to lack of organization it's played half hearted by both teams and you get little satisfaction or sense of entitlement for a win. The potential for strategic depth is there, but as usual when you make pvp-rewards a means of gearing up to incentivize players you get the myriad of afkers and feeders that don't care about the outcome of the matches. Even with the upcoming pvp patches I doubt the coordination of the 20 man teams will turn it into more than another casual gear grind area.\n\nThe Diablo 3 inspired, telegraphed boss fights are fun, but in end-game they become either way too drawn out or too easy. Games like Path of Exile solved this problem by ramping up player damage output at the expense of survivability, making the experience one of dodge or die. In Devilian, especially in end-game, design directs players to address their gear whenever at an impasse granting many ways to improve damage mitigation, but only a few to improve damage. This generates the effect that players will most likely quickly transition into face tanking bosses, rather than finding ways to out-maneuver and glass cannon them. Additionally build balance seems off with crowd control driven skills being the primary means of playing the game.\n\nFor those looking for something casual to burn time on the game can offer a smile or two if you can close an eye on its flaws, but for the traditional MMO player or the challenge craving crowd I'd recommend to pass on this one.\nDuring my one week playing the game after the initial rush from the novelty of Devilian each passing day has left a stronger bitter aftertaste as I waited for it to run its course, realizing only at the end that the game had little to offer beyond the first impressions.","January 6","false","139.6"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

So let´s break this game down into pros & cons.\n\nPROS:\n\n- Let´s start with the obvious. Devilian is F2P so initially you dont have to buy anything.\n- You can buy an item called "Dex" for ingame currency and use it to buy things on the real money shop.\n- Performance is suprisingly good. I don´t have any problems running the game with my old pc.\n- You can get pretty quick to max level. Quests are pretty straight forward.\n- MANY different dungeons that´ll enhance your leveling experience.\n- There´s a paragon system. Just like the one in diablo 3.\n- Devilian Mode(= special transformation with new abilities). Also able to level your devilian form.\n- Up to 15 daily quests and you can select those you prefer.\n- Guild bonuses can be unlocked. Such as salvage, Resurrection and merchant discount.\n- Adding friends offers daily bonuses aswell. (e. g. health potions, gems)\n- Current Endcontent boss is decent (difficulty wise).\n- You can either enter the looking for group tool or manually get one together. (Dungeon/Raid/PVP)\n- You can socket your gear with so called artifacts and upgrade them separately.\n- There´s a Challenge tower in which you have to progress through waves of monsters and try to get as high as possible. Probably compareable to greater rifts (diablo 3)  in some way.\n- Your character is customizable with wings, costumes etc.\n\nCONS:\n\n- Well to get a verified account you have to spend 5$ in any Trion game. Without a verified account you´re not able to sell items on the auction house, whisper to people that are not on your friendslist, use the global chat, initiate trades with other players, send letters and request marketplace items from strangers. Considering in any other game you can get verified via e-mail validation, this is just an obvious way for Trion to make money.\n- Only 4 playable classes at the moment.\n- Classes are gender locked.\n- Balance is simply non-existent. E. g. the berserker class is pretty decent in dungeons and raids, but if you want to play pvp you´re just getting destroyed.\n- Ranged classes can shoot through walls in the pvp arena.\n- If you can crowd control your enemy first, you´re most likely to win the fight. They need to reduce cc time.\n- PVP queues for 20v20 can take up to 30 min. or longer.\n- Even 3v3 queues can take up to 10min.\n- No open world pvp.\n- Limited bag space. Only extendable with real money or DEX.\n- 10 sec. + loading screens.\n- Server lags are happening multiple times a day.\n- There´s some kind of pay to win. For example getting an artifact above +7 without spending real money is kinda impossible.\n- You HAVE TO play pve/pvp and do quests to complete daily challenges.\n- Large guilds that invested some money into the game can take over areas and control the boss spawns. So it may happen that you´re not even able to get those rewards. There should be separate boss spawns outside of those areas.\n- Lack of End-Game content\n- To complete your first endgame set could take very long time. The 2nd one didn´t take that long.\n- At the moment it is hard to get started and find groups outside of your guild. Because everyone is just selling boosts for ingame currency.\n\n\nTo say the least, i would recommend the game. But would I really recommend investing tons of hours into the game ?\nNo, not at the moment.","January 10","true","327.8"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

DONT... Dead game. Too late to join as a free player. Parties are extremely hard to come by. Low population.\n\nLevel fast in this game and can reach the cap in 1 to 2 days or 2 weeks for casual players.\nThis came as a shock to me, but was told the game really starts with the end game.\n\nIts the end game thats disappointing which involves running the same dungeons over and over again in groups. Like in all mmorpgs, having dungeons in a game can be extremely frustrating when trying to find groups, yet this game has based nearly its whole game around finding groups. It's like they've never played a mmo/arpg before.\n\n\nFrom there you have to repeat 15 dailies and Abyssal tower. PvP for those inclined. Guild related quests. Few of.\n\nHowever the game population is dead. Only the top guilds are successful, which there are few of. Majority of players left in the game can barely complete 3 of the 15 dailies available.\n\nNew Stormfront map was questless. Which makes me suspect that future map releases will also involve questless areas.\n\nTrion is deliberately delaying the inevitable. Shutting down the game.\nNot sure how they thought they had a winning formula on their hands by thinking that running the same quests over and over again was appealing. Makes sense that the asian version of the game sunset as is the western which is still struggling to draw breath.\n\nNew Tempest class and new map area with level increase from 52 to 54 was suppose to regenerate the game... which it only slightly did for a fews days, then crashed and burned.\n\nNot sure why Trion only lets you select 4 quests at a time. Need to let us  choose all 15 quests of our choice as groups are extremely hard to find.\n\nTrion really let their clients down with this game.\n\nAlot of nerfing/imbalance/repetitive grinding etc...\n\nOne thing I will say. Not a pay 2 win game\n\n* Running the same dungeons over and over again isn't fun.... get with the programme.\n* Having a 24 stand down from joining other guilds because the dang game is dead is ridiculous.  I understand a 24 hour stand down in a healthy population , not a dead one. Players need to find active guilds. Reduce the time and allow players to join guilds sooner. Really need to join a active guild if you want to complete quests.","February 24","false","507.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Have fun swingin your ♥♥♥♥ around because apparently games can't have normal busts with normal physics. Like to play a melee, ladies? Have fun playing as a roid-raging male. And, of course, we have to toss in the Loli as the only gun-wielder. Seriously, this is 2015..STOP GENDER-LOCKING CLASSES.\n\nThird, is my biggest source of annoyance. Abilities and Keybinds. In the Abilities arena you have several dozen abilities to use, which is nice...'cept because of keybinds you can't bind anything to Mouse Button 4 or 5 because the game doesn't recognize those inputs. C'MON GUYS, this isn't hard.\n\nIt's not a bad game, it's just...a lost game. But really, if you're looking to be a Diablo-style game..go play Path of Exiles or the Torchlight series.\n\nEven though my time says 24hrs (Steam apparently counted having the Devilian Launcher open). I've only put in maybe 3 hours and I really don't see me putting anymore in. The game is boring and offers nothing new or exciting.","December 12, 2015","false","24.6"," 14 of 23 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","14","23","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/durgadurga/recommended/407510/","durgadurga","Durga","http://steamcommunity.com/id/durgadurga/","94 products in account","I've been playing F2P Devilian non-stop since it's come out. I've ever only made one other review, but people seem to be sh*tting all over this game with less than 5 hours of gameplay invested, so I feel a more informed point of view can be of more assitance.\n\nThe game genuinely feels like Diablo and WoW mixed into one game. The first time I logged in I was greeted with a chat system where people weren't spamming like idiots. I had players running around me in the enviornment doing the same quests as I was. Yes, the mob respawn rate is very high to offput the number of players killing them. This, however, is countered by a short 'de-aggro' range, and taking damage does not knock you off of your mount, which by the way is free within the first hour of the game. I never spent more than 20 seconds waiting for a chance to activate a quest point, or wait for something to spawn so I can kill it.\n\nThere are only 4 classes in the game, but each has 3 different talent trees, which you can assign points to as you wish. I chose the Marauder class, and as such my three trees were AoE damage, Single Target Damage, or Tank-ish. It essentially turns the game into 12 classes, instead of 4.\n\nThe combat is fast paced, there are a bunch of different areas your quests take you to, each having dungeons located within them (though not the only way to get to the dungeon, as there is a dungeon finder queue), along with multiple difficulties. Ranging from Normal, Medium, and Hard. While those aren't the actual names of the difficulties, they might as well be. Medium and Hard are your end game to get gear, to my knowledge. Some of the bosses in normal dungeons were hard enough. You'll have to deal with dodging abilities, cones of damage, bombs on the floor, etc. I only imagine it gets much more difficult (and fun) at the higher difficulties.\n\nThe quests themselves aren't anything spectacular, what you'd expect. Go here, kill that, gather this, do this, that, etc. They're fast, mostly easy, and a good source of experience. I'd be a little more upset with the questing system, but it's saving grace is the auto-run feature. No, not in a straight line. Auto-run to exactly where your quest is. In fact, you can open the map, right click on a place, and you're off.\n\nThe different zones I've been to so far seem to vary in theme, some snowy, some firey, some jungle, and even desert.\nYou don't spent too long in each zone, maybe 2 hours depending on how fast you work through it. It's definitely a grind to get to max level, but I'm already nearly done after a few days.\n\nSo. Do I recommend this game? Yes, I do. I didn't look at the reviews as the game came out, didn't research it, just played it for what it was, and I'm having a blast.\n\nSo, let's talk about some pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n-Easy, rewarding combat system\n-Auto-run to quest locations\n-Minimal fighting over mobs/objectives\n-Frequent world events\n-Mostly non-toxic community\n-Mix and match talent system, creating tons of character options\n-Quick leveling experience\n-Easy to learn crafting system\n-Challenging dungeons\n-Full game without paying a penny\n\nCons:\n-Limited player inventory\n-Exp / Money % boosts through in-game store payed with real money\n-F2P accounts cannot trade with each other (from what I hear, don't quote me on that)\n-While large zones, everything feels like a tight squeeze\n-Players often rewarded with "megaphones" that let them broadcast 1 message per megaphone to entire server\n-Definite pay to win vibe, but ultimately paying will not make you stronger than a F2P account.\n\n\nDon't listen to the 1 to 5 hour reviewers. Spend time in a game before you trash it.\n+1","December 12, 2015","true","88.9"," 15 of 25 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","15","25","2","0"

System is easily exploited, and it is P2W. Trion games are usually pay to win, so no surprise there. End game is really slow. Grinding is tedious and repitive. Not a lot of options after you max level cap. Bosses are predictable, no versatility or challenges.\n\nIf you are a limited account, meaning you have not purchased anything on Trion games, beware of this game. You must spend a minimum of $5 or else you will be restricted from lots of resources and vendors within the game.\n\nI have played 431 hours so far, have 4 characters, our of 5 classes. The 5th class is only available through purchase. Again, money.\n\nCustomization is very limited. Don't expect to make your character have various tattoos or hair styles. There's about 5 you can pick from. Classes are gender locked. Only 2/5 classes are male.\n\nSome pros for this game are: Low system requirements. Easy to master. Can be played to max level without spending money (but then you will need to spend $5 to be competitive).\n\nSome cons other than the ones I already listed are: Guild oriented (if you don't have a good guild, you may want to unplug your computer), Tedious and time consuming grinding, Little gear options to choose from, small option pool for mounts/pets/accessories, Game is not set to Daylight Savings Time, limited released content campared to other clients in EU/ASIA, again it is a Trion related game so it will cost you some money. Open world is very small, get used  to seeing the same areas, repeatedly. PVP doesn't queue often (pigs would fly before it kicks off). Maitenance is not routinely ran on the servers or game content, so be aware bugs are frequent and they will most likely not be fixed for 3-5 weeks. This game is slowly dying (not a lot of people play this game). Camera view isn't classical third party (you have to get used to it). Not many achievements to unlock in-game and ZERO for steam.\n\nAll together, I would not play this game. I switched to Black Desert Online. This game is not recommended. Been a PC gamer for 11 years now. Some people may like this game if you're a beginner. But if you play PC MMORPGs often, this is not the game for you.

Pro's: it runs ok'ish (had a few crashes), looks alright and I think the music is kind of nice too (albeit repetitive, there's this piano tune you really do hear quite a lot). As you level there's factions, dungeons, daily quests, plenty to keep you busy. Not too shabby.\n\nCons: between mid & max level devil form is still useless and the game becomes inventory tycoon, unless you expand your inventory through the usual means. Now, if the devil form was more interesting I probably would throw some money at it because the game is kind of enjoyable. But as it stands now the game's iconic devilian / devil form or whatever is a complete bore. I feel like I'm better off not using it and I've not really seen other people use it in dungeons either. With it's iconic devil form being a letdown I feel like this game fails to stand out from the competition.\n\nI kind of hope it's better at max level but I'm not sticking around for that.

That's it. Not sure if some are faster than others though.\n\nPets and Funtunality iterms are there for convinience.\nSome pets have autoloot and some can be used as extra inventory and some can actually sell your junk so you don't have to run to the merchant everytime.\n\nAnd you also have XP boost as well.\n\nThere are some questionable items in the marketplace though like you can buy an item that allows you to re-roll attributes on weapons and armour HOWEVER unlike ArchAge these stones have be gotta ingame.\nExtra inventory slots can also be bought from the marketplace and also as rewards.\n\nThe Patreon perks are also gladly not P2W as it does not lock out features for non patreon players. Although some might argue that having access to a 3rd skill page is P2W but it isn't as you cannot switch while in combat. Also you can reset skill points for free as well.\n\nFor those who cannot pay fow patreon with real cash you can buy DEX from other players with ingame currency. DEX allows you to have patreon status without paying monthly.\n\nThe max level is 52 however like in diablo 3 there is another level system after you hit max level and also your devilian form can be leveled up as well.\n\nOverall Devilian is a fun MMOARPG that you should try out. So if you are one of those "I really want to play this but it's published by Trion" give it a go. I personally feel that Trion has learnt their mistakes from ArcheAge and will not repeate the same mistake again, at least I hope not. Only time will tell if they start making this game P2W.","December 10, 2015","true","36.8"," 30 of 55 people (55%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","55","30","55","3","6"

Chat and trade/auction house restrictions on limited accounts are neglegible, especially if you play to play the game in the long run (since you'll likely sub if you plan on staying around that long anyway).\n\n\nTo compare Devilian to Diablo or Path of Exile probably makes sense for a lot of people, but unfortunately they are not the best comparison. Instead, Drakensang Online is more appropriate as that is also an MMOARPG just like Devilian (and is technically a year older).\n\nThe reason I say this is because maps are not instances like they are in Diablo and Path of Exile. By that I mean, you don't see everyone in a town hub and they magically no longer exist once you head outside of town unless you're partied with them. No, you see and interact with other players both in towns and out in the maps - the only areas that are instanced are dungeons.\n\nBeing in the ARPG genre, you've got your mob grinding, your dungeon grinding, equipment grinding, and so on from a top-down third-person perspective. Not something that's going to entertain a lot of people for a prolongued period of time, but for those that enjoy the genre you'll be right at home.\n\nMarketplace is currently lackluster in items outside of inventory expansion, character slots, and a small assortment of pets, mounts, and costumes. Much of everything else (XP boosts, talisman box, attribute stones, and megaphones) are gotten through the login rewards tracker as well as Archegemstones from Abyssal Tower and such. More costumes I'd expect to see added as more content from the other regions are translated and introduced, as well as things like additional classes.","December 20, 2015","true","82.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

People want freedom on creating their avatar and restrictions hurt creativity. Though the big thing that made it hard for me to continue on was looking at the skill/tree system. Sure I had all these skills I could learn - I think, but the system itself is very confusing and didn't make it abundantly clear on certain aspects of learning skills and what the mechanics behind the skill was. Storage/bag space was very limited and it looks to cash shop dependent for my tastes.

'Affected players' being people with no gear and unable to use skills. Trion claims to have sent compensation for characters who lost gear. I have received nothing. They do not yet claim to have fixed the problem with skills being disabled. Perhaps they could explain how affected players are intended to benefit from an XP bonus in an ARPG where they have no gear and no usable skills?\n\n\nI registered an account on Friday using Chrome, since their website apparently dislikes Microsoft Edge. Today I logged into the game for the second time. My character had no gear at all and I get an error message when attempting to use skills. So their website didn't work properly and their game didn't work properly.\n\nI can't properly judge their Free2Play model yet. The default two character slots feels a little stingy, but not wholly unreasonable. At the time of writing there is DLC available for €4.99, €19.99, €49.99 and €99.99. I won't be spending money on any of these until the problems are dealt with and Devilian has been stable for some time.\n\nOverall I thought the combat was fun, the game felt responsive and it was a pleasant enough looking game. It's designed for Eastern audiences and I'm not personally fond of anime, e.g. the Canoneer class (each class is locked into a single race & gender, however there's customization options for hair style & colour, several faces, etc). The game did seem overly booby at times - rotating the Evoker results in some very noticeable jiggling.\n\ntl;dr: Trion strikes again? The publisher doesn't have the best track record, and early problems combined with asking for €99.99 for the "Immortal Pack" makes me wonder whether this is any more than a cashgrab. The ARPG / MMO hybrid has potential, but for now I'm sticking with Path of Exile & Diablo III.","December 13, 2015","false","1.6"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

And Since pvp is so unbalanced there was no joy for me in this game. So i stopped playing it\n\n\nFirst , The "you have to pay so we know for sure you are human , and stop the bots" well , i didnt really mind this problem , Its okay , the restrictions aint that big , not a big deal , untill the moment i saw bots spamming in chat ..So you force people to pay to make sure they are human , but bots still get in the game? It makes this a stupid "rule" because it isnt stopping bots and its just forcing us to pay\n\n\nSecond , the mob spawn , the mobs spawn wayyy  wayyyyy 2 fast , As soon as you finish killing a boss/mob they are already spawning again by your side , I mean , you can always run because they will not chase you forever , but its stupid because you are still picking up the loot from a boss/bunch of mobs and the same boss/bunch of mobs are already spawning again\n\n\nThird , The PvP is extremly unbalanced , AoE and CC are way too much overpowered , AoE does way more damage than a single target atack , wich shouldnt happen , and if you get CC"ed" you might as well take your hands of the keyboard because you are dead anyway. (there are some potions that remove CC but their cooldown is way too high) .Since evoker is the character with most AoE + CC this makes them almost unkillable in pvp while they roam around making everyone die in 2-3 seconds , this makes the pvp not fun at all.\n\n\nFourth , The talismans , I literally feel like a child again playing those facebook games. This talismans are cards that increase your power , you equip them like normal gear , you can fuse them (get a better card yey) , salvage them (get things to do a better card yey) and level them up by "killing" other cards (yey , fun), etc.\n\nSo you just pointed out a bunch of serious problems , why are you continuing to play the game? Well , I Hope they will fix this , even though i doubt, (i have a feeling that they will just follow the korean version making no changes at all , and just follow them like dogs)\nAnd even though the game has this serious problems its still a lot of fun , the dungeons are fun to make , quests are easy and fun , the leveling up isnt too easy but neither true hard , its kind of a perfect balance ,\n\nBut yeah , if you are into pvp dont play this game untill you have news from a patch where they nerfed AoE or something..","December 24, 2015","false","6.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cagbag/recommended/407510/","cagbag","twitch CagBag","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cagbag/","206 products in account","This review is coming from someone who was rank 1 on the leaderboards for a while IGN - CagBag\n\nFirst and formost there are a lot of debates about if this game is pay2win or not, and the simple answer is yes. Although the pay2win is not as crazy as it is in Trions other IPs it is still there. I payed approximately £50 into the game and I was top of the leaderboards for about the first week and was also the first person to own a full set Tragedy, this was mainly due to the amount of time I put into the game and days I went without sleep. But soon the people who had played a lot less and payed a lot more surpassed me on both the leaderboards and gear (which is where i decided to quit). It is true that you can play this game without spending a penny on any microtransactions you will never be able to be competative.\n\nOkay now that that's out of the way I'll talk about some of the other Issues I have with the game and more so the Dev team. Shortly after release the Seadrift server went down for maintanence which was supposed to last for 4 hours, It lasted for almost 24 hours, and when the maintanence was finally over and players were able to log back into their server they were appaulled to find that their characters had been lost. All their hardwork, time and dedication were just completely gone. Seeing as this was a new launch we all expected their to be some issues but when this happened not once but twice in the space of 2 days that was just a joke. After people lost all their stuff they quickly rushed to get back to the end-game content and start working towards their gear all over again just to have it ripped away once more, this is totally unacceptable for a fully released game.\n\nGender locking. Don't do it game devs...\n\nAlthough those Issues are awful they're basically the only problems I had with the game apart from the lack of quests, lore and crafting the rest I really enjoyed and felt this was the kind of game I'd been looking for.\n\nLet's look at some of the Pro's shall we;\nFast paced action RPG style combat.\nBeautiful graphics and models.\nChallenging end-game content (if you're melee).\nMany different distractions to take you away from the grind.\nResetable skilltree system allowing you to change the way you play constantly.\nClaimable land for your guild to fight for.\nChallenging guild dungeons.(unless you're in Pulse guild then it's easy :p)\n\nAs much as I enjoyed the game I honestly can't recommend this to anyone who doesn't have thausands of pounds to throw away. The main player base for ARPG's like Diablo and Path of Exile are there because of the leaderboards and striving to be the best, which is impossible unless you pay in Devillian. The same goes for MMO's with the PvP content, you want to be the best well nop surprise the PvP is the same as ArcheAge where those who pay earn the rights to use your corpse as toilet paper. However what I will say is if you have 1-2 friends who are looking to just play through the story together then you may have a good time but until you get to the end-game I'm pretty sure it's impossible to die unless you take a 5 minute break against a boss.\n\nTLDR:\nTrion Worlds.","January 9","false","145.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Like a lot of other reviewers said, there are substantial pay walls at end game that make it just too much of a grind.  Between enchants, salvaging, talismans, gems, artifacts, butcher runes, much less gear, it will take quite some time to grind it all out, and in-game gold (all of the previous take in-game money to advance).  If you don't get a patron account, you can't sell on the AH; if you do, you can sell some things on the AH, but not enough to really make money, unless you grind the same 4 dungeons ALL day.  I paid $40, my husband paid $60, and while we felt we got our money's worth, we started doing the grind math and it wasn't working out.   If you're looking to kill a lot of time in your life, like you're looking to drop out of college, maybe look to this, but otherwise find something better to do.","January 3","false","65.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Challenging on occasion even.\nTalent trees and classes are very enjoyable, and the biggest plus for me is you can convert gold to "real money" currency that you can use to purchase items with. The items are mostly convinience/appearance so there is no "p2w" in the game.\n\nNegatives:\nPvp arena has weak season rewards, but has instant rewards after winning/losing.\nRanking board does not explain lots.\nQue times for pvp are long, can be anywhere from 1-15 minutes, but thats expected of a new game with a building player base.\n\n\nOverall I would definetly reccomend this game, and after all it is free so give it a try,\n","December 21, 2015","true","827.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sylqt/recommended/407510/","Sylqt","Syl","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sylqt/","239 products in account","I was pleasantly surprised with Devilian. From looking at the previews and the rumours I had heard from others, I assumed it was just a "ripped off tera wannabe" but with some hack'n'slash added. It turned out to be a pretty fun ARPG with a good MMO aspect. I saw that one of the Eu servers was down considerably during the launch week, but being Trion I left that up to them being Trion and not the game itself.\n\nLevelling up did not feel like a chore, I played all of the classes through the first 10 or so levels and ended up sticking with the Evoker (to max lvl) and Canoneer (halfway there!) as two classes I really enjoyed. The gameplay is fun, albeit easy, hacky and slashy as exected, there are lots of dungeons for you to go through as you level that you can run as many times as you want. After completing a dungeon, you can set it up a level (all the way to +3) for better lootdrops and difficulty, all of the dungeons are easily solo'd all the way up to max level. The skill points are set up so you can reset them at any time for free, making experimentation the best way to find the way you enjoy playing.\n\nThe pvp is... an aoefest, laggy and somewhat bland, but it was enjoyable enough for me to queue up for a second, then a third match and so on until I'd spent a whole evening playing 20vs20. I have been unable to play a 3v3 or 6v6 game at max level, so will update my review when I get round to that. You can queue either in Devilian form, or as your normal form. Both are fun enough, and seems to be the only way to gear your devilian form. The queues do not seem that active, but it's a nice hobby in between dungeon runs.\n\nThe endgame currently is a little sparse, seems to be enough for me to run until my gear is perfect. With the look of the current map I can see that hopefully a lot of content will be coming our way (also, there is gear in game for level 54!) and with this being a f2p game, it means you can drop in and out whenever you want to.\n\nAll in all, I was very happily surprised at how fun Devilian is. It doesn't really bring anything new to the table as far as ARPGs go, but it looks lovely and is great fun both solo and in a group. If you're a fan of Diablo and Path of Exile this is a great game to add into your rotation. I will be happily grinding at max level for a while, and patiently waiting for new content! :)","December 21, 2015","true","45.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For me, it has everything i ever wanted to see in an MMORPG and more. What those things are you ask? Let me explain...\n\nLet me start off with a few negative things here: The quests are extremely dull, the classes are gender-locked and Trions system to verify you as a human are a straight up obvious money grab (tho you don´t have to do it).\n\nBut what does this game have that i missed in other MMOs? Here are a few things i find in some MMOs but never united in one:\n\n- The combat system\nFor me, one of the most important parts of a game, it is straight up awesome. It´s not as refined as Diablo, but it´s quick, action packed and even with my horrible interent: accurate (concerning the hitboxes). It makes fun and made me completely overlook the dulled down quest system.\n\n- The End-Game\nI hate a level cap. The only other MMO i really played was Perfect World back in the day, so i guess that´s the reason why i can´t stand being blocked in progression. I never thought this was possible, but Devilian combines nearly infinite leveling with the end-game system other games like World of Warcraft offer.\nThe maximum level is 52 (at the point of this review) but once you hit that, you still have to level your Devilian-Form and your proficiencies, much like the Paragon-System in Diablo 3.\nAnd yet you get an equipment score with which you may or may not enter in some of the later dungeons. Which brings me to the next point...\n\n- The Dungeons\nVery well designed layouts combined with awesome bosses make these stand out from any other game. Throughout your journey you will enter many of them, and even at the end, they stay relevant. Farming Heroic dungeons until your gear is ready to head into Hell dungeons just so you can farm that extra bit of Resistance-Essence, Setpiece of your armor, gem to level up your artifact or other materials to improve your character makes for an endgame i´ve never seen so diverse. There is a ton of stuff to improve on which means a ton of stuff to do. Way better than just to farm for one equipment piece over and over again...\n\n- PvP\nNow i don´t mean the normal PvP, i mean real PvP. Guildwars, Arenas, PvP areas. 20v20, 6v6, 3v3. I can´t believe something like this is missing in so many games. I just love going into Teamspeak with my friends and play together against other players. It´s not as well done as in Perfect World as there is no territorial system, but it´s still a lot of fun to be had.\n\nI could extend this list but those were the most important facts on why i think this game deserves some attention. I will keep playing it, i hope you join the party...","December 13, 2015","true","10.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

But I dont know what happened, I couldnt really enjoy playing the game after almost two hours.\n\nEnemies are everywhere,  it feels croweded with them.  But none of them felt worth killing, and you have auto run options that just walk you past them.\n\nThere are fetch quests like in a MMO.. go kill 5 of these things,  fix  nets,  find some books ect.    But several parts of the quest text goes by really fast or are cut off, and other parts just feel dull and lack personality.  In the end I felt no desire to try reading them even if there was a chance of doing so.\n\nOverall it just felt like the paceing was backwords.  The slow parts went by too fast, the fast parts felt slow, exploring wasnt very fun becaues it was too packed with enemies, and killing enemies felt unrewarding.","December 14, 2015","false","1.8"," 53 of 104 people (51%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","51","53","104","5","0"

Well I have a lot of problems with this game and it's mostly just the class diversification.\n\nLet's just say it up straight right here. If this review isn't convincing enough for you to avoid this game then please for the love of god just play the Evokers and/or Cannoneer class. There is little reason to play the other classes, whatever they may be at the time you read this review. Reason being is that right now not only are they dominating in both pve and pvp, they are the most dominant (in numbers) class in this game. Everywhere you go there will be evokers and cannoneers. Very RARELY will you see a berserker or shadowhunter... because those classes are just complete @SS.\n\nHere's just a small example as to what I'm talking about:\n\nhttp://oi64.tinypic.com/2rg2hde.jpg\n\nThat is an example of a pvp game. The pvp matchup is random but how can it be this bad? In fact this happens more often than you think. So what's wrong with that? First, level 52 is the max level in this game, but how can there be more 52s on the other side than my side. Second, the other side is FILLED with evokers and cannoneers while my side is a bit diversed, but not saying much.\nTo top it off with tbagging the berserker, the pvp game is almost ending, our side trailing behind by almost 1000 points; that list of players is sorted by players with the most points at the top and lowest at the bottom. Surprise surprise, the berserker on the other side is at the bottom... ANNDDDD he's level 52, the max level. Seven assists means he tried his best in battle but couldn't quite get the kill.\nSo what's the point of berserkers? Nothing, they are useless and so are shadowhunters.\n\nAll in all, just stick with evokers and cannonners. Why is this happening? Because every class is pretty much the same, just that ranged characters get the HUGE upper hand of dealing the SAME EXACT damage as a melee character but has more crowd control and range. If their ranged ulimate skill has the same exact cooldown and skill damage as a melee character then what is a point of a melee character? Tank? Surely nope because as you play harder dungeons, going melee is absolutely NOT RECOMMENDED because you die in one or two hits.\n\nWith that said, the devs don't know how to make a class and the berserker class shows. There are been no buffs for them and devs fail to acknowledge that this class is extremely weak right now. They will not be used in end game dungeons and they are immediately kicked when a game shows up for end game dungeons.\n\nIf you DON'T trust me then go ahead, I ain't stopping you from playing a berserker, or shadowhunter for that matter. Disregard that picture/link i posted above. Go waste your 50 hours on this class.\n\nBut honestly if you don't trust me, go play the beserker until you can queue up for pvp. Play a few rounds, like 3 or 4 and see how much ranged classes are DOMINATING. See how many cannoneers and evokers are on each side and i bet they always outnumber the other classes 3 to 1.\n\nDon't say I didn't warn you.\n\nRating: 1/5. In game females characters dominate in this game. Typical for a company's only way to draw customers is to put females everywhere they can and it just so happens that the playable female characters tied to those genders are evokers and cannoneers.

It's gender-locked, but who cares? Overall fun game for a little bit, but I can't recommend it due to the horrible pvp balance. Skill can play a role, but basically the team with the most evokers almost always wins. One evoker can take out 5 players easy. Their combination of damage and CC is too strong, making the pvp boring and to make it worse, the developers haven't acknowledged it and probably will never fix it.\n\nItems are closer to marvel heroes than they are d3/PoE, and when I think of an ARPG my focus is the items & the builds. Builds are limited to 3 specs for each class, so very little variety. As far as an ARPG goes, this game is ♥♥♥♥.

I was excited for it's release and played it on the day it was open to all players.\nPlaying this game for so many long hours and then realizing a lot of it. In my personal opinion, this game is really a pay-to-play game. When I say the tempest release I was excited, but saw that you had to pay for it, but of course, it's a different gameplay than  other classes. It somewhat makes sense, but not really at the same time.\n*Pros:\n-You kill things, kite, and pretty much just use one skill to kill everything.\n-Similar to Diablo gameplay, Diablo lovers may like this game.\n-Loads of quests and group dungeons.\n-Hillarious to play with friends.\n-PVP is entertaining to watch between players.\n-The Devillian form is an intresting mechanic and is quite fun.\n*Cons:\n-Other than the quest line, you have to pay for it.\n-You can't play the amazing tempest class without paying.\n-Gets kinda boring after you get the skill that kills everything.\n-You don't really take damage, unless you play cannnoner, then you take some.\n-Boss questing with friends is glitchy, you sometimes don't finish the quest if you or your friend kills it.\n-Literally the story is really boring and just the cliche, oh no there is demons killing everyone help story.\nWould I recommend this game?\nNo. Just no. I would only suggest it to someone who would be willing to pay for most of the gameplay. Only if it was like Diablo, just multiplayer... Of course it has hours worth of gameplay and hillarity behind it's gameplay, but really I suggest you don't play it.","March 20","false","18.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Got 1 toon to lvl52 (max) and one to lvl 40. Combat is fun and fast, and I would expect this from the same people who made Tera. You get 24 spaces in your inventory and trust me you're going to need a lot more, which will cost you real money. And even if you get Patron (which is a sub) you still have to play 5 days to get 15 log in points just to buy 8 inventory spaces, red flag #2.\n\nMaking gold was very slow at the beginning but I heard it was much easier in higher levels. Kinda true but everything costs more, you need to upgrade everything to progress in end game and that all costs in game gold. With Patron you can buy and sell on the auction house, except there's no money to be made or never enough, which forces you to buy dex from Trion to sell in game for gold - red flag #3.\n\nThe drop rate for butchery gear (2nd highest in game) is really low unless you make pre-made parties of 3 and enter, don't look for parties you will never get a piece. You will also need gems, runes etc.. so it's grinding the SAME dungeons over and over.\n\nHop on the gear treadmill 'cause it going to be a long ride, strictly for them to make more money. Don't get me wrong, I know game makers want to make money, but this isn't the way--it's like gambling 'cause the RNG is high in this game. I spent 60 bucks and played 97 hours. id I get my moneys worth? Kinda. Wish I would have not spent so much time on something that's going nowhere. Save your time and money.

As far as leveling up goes the quest line could use work however the dungeons are what we play for and they are spectacular. End game is fairly easy, and its fairly easy to gear your charachter in butchery gear but past that you get the more grindy feeling. This game isn't bad it just requires you to do a bit of work and mat grinding to get better. The social aspect at end game is absolutely huge you need to make friends or you wont be doing much harder content without a gold fee. The gold in this game is harder to come by then in most games so when you first start out avoid the AH completely you don't need it and will regret it when you reach the level cap. However overall this game is great yes it does make it easier if you spend real money for your mats but you don't have to and that little pay for an advantage is in almost any free to play game, how else would they be making profit off this?","December 31, 2015","true","124.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

It's a mix between World of warcraft and diablo. You have the combat system and the way to kill monsters from Diablo, and the open world from WoW. It's a very good combination! Here is some Pros / Cons about the game, I will also explain why I made these Pros / Cons, thanks! Enjoy\n\nPros:\n+ Free to play, easy to get your friends into the game since they don't have to pay.\n+ Easy to level up at lower levels, in other words... very easy to get a quick feeling about the game.\n+ They update the game and really care about it.\n+ Everything that is in the store for real money is also buyable with ingame gold, which makes the game not pay to win.\n+ A good community, people care about their own stuffs instead of putting the blame on others, and most of them are willing to help with any questions you may have ingame.\n+ It's very simple to understand the point of the game and learning new things, pretty self-explanatory.\n\nCons:\n- It was some server problems on release date that made many people blame the game and so on.\n- If you want to get access to things quicker you can buy things ingame with real money.\n\nAight, the Pros are kinda easy to see what I mean, so I will focuse on the Cons here, and the thing is that.. when Devilian released, the game had problems with the main server of EU called Seadrift, that problem was pretty huge, it was offline for every night for 3 days, about 4 hours every night and also they end that with a 24 hours maintence.\nThat made alot of people blame and flame and cry about the game and spamming bad reviews around, and I admit that it was pretty annoying, but it worked perfectly after that maintence and they mostly did it to make sure it won't happend again.\nThey also gave every player 3-days of 50% xp boost and such, so now the server are very stable and It's really worth going into this game.\n\nSo, many people blame and flame and so on that this game is pay to win, I guess 95% of those people who say it's pay to win, don't know what they talking about at all. To make this clear:\n\nP2W = Pay to Win = If you can buy things in the game that is only accessable with real money which makes people who spend real money on the game extremly overpowered compared to others, and there is no way for regular players to have a fair chance to win against the guy who used real money. That is Pay to win, nothing els. For example, 99% of every game out there have people in their hometown of the game that spam things about goldsellers, and since you can buy gold from those people and get " better " than others... that makes the game pay to win?\n\nThis game dosen't have Pay to win, this game have a market with things for example.. mounts / pets / outfits / Xp boost and so on, it's only cosmetic things, and the XP boost dosen't make you a better player, it only makes your character level abit quicker. There is also something in the game called DEX, you can buy that from the market / AH for gold, that DEX is turned into Credits by just right clicking on it, and you are able to spend the Credits in the market for the XP boost / Cosmetics and such, so It's very fair.\n\nThey made it so when you make a new account, you aint able to use the Yell chat ( Announce ) and you cant trade others, ( you can accept trades ) you can of course use the real chat, but as long as you put any cents into any game of the Glyph account it will be verified which means you get access to everything, and this is to prevent botters and gold farmers in the game, and I can understand that, goldfarmers will always exist in any games out there, but they get reduced by alot with this thing. This is a company of course and they need money aswell as any other companies out there, and they really deserve a penny for this game. It's very playable without putting a single cent into the game tho.","December 20, 2015","true","304.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","1"

"It's free — I'm bored — why the hell not?"\n\nIf you're the above, play it for the sake of playing, but it's essentially a Korean-translated browser game in standalone, launcher format... You literally just need to click a button and the character will run across the entire world to do monotonous grinding quests.\n\nNo. The game is not Pay 2 Win (P2W). This implies that you can buy everything to get everything, which isn't accurate at all. Everything in game you can purchase through gameplay and dedication. Selling G2-G3 gems is a fast, fat currency maker, which allows you to buy paid-money credits, called DEX, which then allows you to buy cash-shop items.\n- No gear is for sale. Only aesthetics.\n- A few Bonus Loot items are for sale, but you get so many bonus loot items in game that it seems far fetched to assume this holds bearing.\n\nThe game levels insanely fast.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mckay_/recommended/407510/","mckay_","McKay","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mckay_/","109 products in account","TLDR:  I've put a lot of time and effort into this game (300+ hours); Also a good bit of cash, which I am now regretting.  I'm getting fed up with games that promise to deliver content and expand upon it in a timely manner only to have the companies renege and disappoint entire communities. When dealing with the support for this game, it feels like an after thought;  Like they aren't taking it seriously and have no communication with one another.  The web page itself feels like a slapped together wordpress blog with a free forum board strapped to it with ductape;  It's insulting. ((I'm a web desinger/developer.  I notice that stuff.)) There isn't enough content to keep most hard core players interested.  Wide spread bans, lagging, exploits and bot issues are another huge turn off.  What the game promised through game play in the begining, it failed miserably to deliver at the end.\n\n\n-------------------------------------\nI can't justify continuing to play.  I'm not even as geared as I could be but I honestly can't bring myself to follow through grinding out runes from AD and dust for talismans as there is no content to aim for coming out in the immediate future.  So what am I supposed to do?  Spend the next month grinding the same dungeons over and over again for gear and stats I'll replace when the new content arrives?  Am I supposed to enjoy the ever shrinking population of pvpers?  I feel like the new daily gifts are a 'please stick around' consolation prize for all the banning, lagging, exploits and bots.\n\nThe lag issues that effected the entire NA Asperon server where horrendous.  When support was contacted, despite this being a SERVER WIDE ISSUE, the players were blamed.  *sarcasm*  Of course!  Thousands of players all having lag issues --all at the same time-- must be a software issue; something in our startup.  Obvious.\n\nAnd then there was the exploit that they released with the game that they KNEW was there since alpha essentially allowing players the opportunity to screw up the leveling curve, the economy and the community when the exploiters where finally banned... after two weeks.  I know two weeks doesn't sound like an awful lot to some, but to others that first two weeks in the game is when you set your pace.  The first two weeks is when you find your companions/friends.  Those first two weeks after release, pretty damn important to someone who wants to push content.\n\nI love the community in this game; Amazing people - I've made some great friends that I really hope to cary on gaming with.  And the game play itself is amazing -- There's just not enough of it to keep hard core MMO players occupied.  Overwhelming at the beginning, but you can knock it all out with effort and time.  Maybe I chew up content too quickly, but I don't feel like there is enough.  When the new stuff comes out, will I devour it just as quickly and be bored again?  I feel like that will definitely be the case.","January 12","false","383.5"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

Yeah they released new class that costs money, but then again there are $60 games that sell classes too so i can see how one game thats very f2p friendly could ask for your money.\n\nentire game is f2p, patron (monthly sub) benefits are minor too so i really dont understand all the *p2w* fuss, and im totally against p2w games. Im not saying its not possible to progress faster if you spend real money, because that wouldnt be true, but the game really is perfectly playable as a free player too. And if you think this cash shop is bad, then you havent played Allods or Archeage :)\n\nI did start a bit late though, so i missed first few months so not really sure how was it back then but even now, after all supposed nerfs i find it very playable as a f2p player.\nNot to mention you could actually buy cash shop currency with in game money, which would let you buy new class with in game gold, so for ones that can stomach a grind, thats an option too.

I think the point that people miss is that F2P games require some sort of monetary compensation to keep the development cycle going and given the way this game plays, you can tell that some work went into the actual design and implementation of it. All the marketplace items are vanity based or convenience. The way the characters have a sense of "weight" is perfect and the ability to solo through some of the content is quite nice given that I enjoy a good romp by myself every now and again. I may update this as I progress through the levels but for a free to play game, it definitely deserves a try.

I always wondered why there hasn't been a game like this? combining the combat/skill system of diablo 3 and put it into a MMORPG setting. And the customization and talisman card etc are so in depth there is a lot you can explore in this game. To be honest, the talisman cards can literally be its own game, like a mobile game or something. It's that much you can explore. And it'll never bore you.\n\nHowever, unlike many MMOs, this game is very casual to play. All the quests are quick. And there's even an auto-run button that auto runs your toon to the target location to do/pick-up/turn-in quests. You can finish a dungeon in less than 10min. And because it's the diablo 3 combat, it's also a lot more casual. You can just log in and play for 15 min as a break to whatever you're doing and then go back and do what you want to do. It's not like some MMOs you'll have to be on for 1-2 hours for a raid.\n\nAnd... this game has guilds, raid, ops etc. I think this will cater to many many players who want a game you can explore deep, but one that also let you play it very casually.\n\nSo far, there are only 4 classes. I hope they can add more classes/characters. This game has so much potential, they can even add champions like those MOBA games for players to play.","December 17, 2015","true","16.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

European server Seadrift had huge problems with stability and data loss. All characters lost their progress and gear day or 2 after my start. The server later went offline for nearly 2 days due to maintenance and there was another disruption of service for all users due to crashed login verification server. Why is this important? Most paid features seems to be time limited, which might be problematic if you pay for patron access or somethign similar and you cant play.\n\nBad, Ugly...Microtransactions\nI want to comment on the payment/microtransaction model and the way game is designed around it. I will say it upfront that I have not explored all of options nor experienced complete game, I decided to stop playing before I could do so.\n\nUnfortunately, this game resembles mobile free-to-play games in its design that is made to purposefuly annoy players and force them to buy microtransactions. This is something I'm not willing to tolerate on PC titles. I want to enjoy games, not being annoyed by them knowing such annoyance is done on purpose.\nThe game has paid transportation system with ingame currency but you soon realize it is very pricey for amount of ingame currency you earn, at least at start. Your free teleport to city/village is on 30 minutes cooldown on free account, 10 seconds on patron paid account. Your inventory is extremely limited to the point you either ignore loot, salvage it (which costs huge amount of ingame currency if you are a starter and you get lot of loot as you progress) or spend unholy amount of time traveling to nearest merchant and back to your grinding location. You have storage space in cities/villages, which can be accessed remotely--you get free trial for 7 days, after which you must pay for it. Given how small your inventory is, it is nearly mandatory to buy remote warehouse access (patron account). I almost forgot to mention you cant send email from free account, supposedly to prevent spamming and scamming as explained by the deveoper...\n\nConclusion, TLDR\nI have spent 1000s of hours playing Path of Exile, which has one of best and most fair microtransaction models, therefore, I know  free to play games can be enjoyable. I have spent 100s of hours in paid for ARPG titles, which were mostly worth their price with few misses here and there. Devilian did not convince me to spend my hard earned cash on the game. In fact and to my surprise, the game did not even try to entice me and drag me into its world. Restriction are ever present from very start, the game design focused on pushing you to spend money on microtransaction. Quests are bland and uninspiring to a point where you dont read the flavor text and just auto-run (game feature) to location where you kill stuff.\n\nI can not recommend this game for people that are looking for next ARPG title either seeking novelty, refreshment or just to kill some time. There are better alternatives on the market in both paid for and free to play categories.","December 19, 2015","false","27.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The speed of this game is what keeps me coming back, from pulling whole quest areas and then proceeding to take all my focus to not get wombo'd by the massive group I just pulled, to the super speedy dungeon runs there is very little downtime when playing.  The classes are decently varied with various builds to do (you can combine specs for specific skills you would like, such as grabbing a taunt from one beserker spec to use on a different spec for better threat).  Leveling is a very welcomed and decent speed as I've hit lvl 50 in about 24 hours play time.\n\nMost of the gripes people have about the game come from limited inventory space, which I agree with.  There are however free albeit time consuming ways to get your inventory expanded for free (it requires you to buy currency with ingame gold and then spending login points on inventory space).  If you enjoy the game, buying the 20 dollar starter pack gives you all the inventory you'll need.\n\nPros:\n-Fast paced\n-Fun classes\n-Easy to attain max level\n-Easy to grasp gearing at max level\n-Fun guild system\n\nCons:\n-Limited number of classes (more to come apparently)\n-Low inventory space early on\n-Sometimes spammy combat (could be a pro for some)\n-Talisman system could use some work :\ (feels a bit luck-based rather than just putting in hard work)","December 16, 2015","true","44.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

Easy to kill things, hard to die. For the comparisons of Diablo;PoE, I'd say its  closer to a mix of Diablo 3 and Torchlight.

Devilian... think side scroller hack and slash fun times especially if you play with other players maybe but Devilian, you should have taken more notes from Symphony of the Night. ya no need for camera mode revamp if you just make a patch that creates a nice autolock-on feature to help actually hit the enemies because I am having a difficult time aiming my spells at the enemies and like say my lightning bolt has ten seconds on cooldown or something it keeps shooting the wrong way helllppp ppllleeaaassee ;p\n\nFinal first look analysis: ok it looks kool pretty much like the art makes me feel like I'm doing Dark Blood Online which is nice since Dark Blood went Offline (sad face, also Dark Blood allowed joystick controll btw)  yeah can't knock this ♥♥♥♥ if they're giving it away right? well guess again! i friggin hate the dang christmas music in the castle, turn that $%% the hell off! I'm gonna go play some of these other games i can kick back and use the controller on until the xmas is over and you update that, plenty other awesome games, I recommend checking out Snail's new Black Gold Online also for free to play, the guys who made Age of Wushu did something crazy with flying dragon mounts and robots and there is a mouse look / camera turn function to look at the slightly buggy beautiful artworks in high detail with a new custom designed and self built mid atx tower I have decided to call her The Stealth Ninja Assassin 5000 it's a beast and quiet as hell xD coming for you in the dead of night so sleep tight","December 21, 2015","true","6.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

European server Seadrift had huge problems with stability and data loss. All characters lost their progress and gear day or 2 after my start. The server later went offline for nearly 2 days due to maintenance and there was another disruption of service for all users due to crashed login verification server. Why is this important? Most paid features seems to be time limited, which might be problematic if you pay for patron access or somethign similar and you cant play.\n\nBad, Ugly...Microtransactions\nI want to comment on the payment/microtransaction model and the way game is designed around it. I will say it upfront that I have not explored all of options nor experienced complete game, I decided to stop playing before I could do so.\n\nUnfortunately, this game resembles mobile free-to-play games in its design that is made to purposefuly annoy players and force them to buy microtransactions. This is something I'm not willing to tolerate on PC titles. I want to enjoy games, not being annoyed by them knowing such annoyance is done on purpose.\nThe game has paid transportation system with ingame currency but you soon realize it is very pricey for amount of ingame currency you earn, at least at start. Your free teleport to city/village is on 30 minutes cooldown on free account, 10 seconds on patron paid account. Your inventory is extremely limited to the point you either ignore loot, salvage it (which costs huge amount of ingame currency if you are a starter and you get lot of loot as you progress) or spend unholy amount of time traveling to nearest merchant and back to your grinding location. You have storage space in cities/villages, which can be accessed remotely--you get free trial for 7 days, after which you must pay for it. Given how small your inventory is, it is nearly mandatory to buy remote warehouse access (patron account). I almost forgot to mention you cant send email from free account, supposedly to prevent spamming and scamming as explained by the deveoper...\n\nConclusion, TLDR\nI have spent 1000s of hours playing Path of Exile, which has one of best and most fair microtransaction models, therefore, I know  free to play games can be enjoyable. I have spent 100s of hours in paid for ARPG titles, which were mostly worth their price with few misses here and there. Devilian did not convince me to spend my hard earned cash on the game. In fact and to my surprise, the game did not even try to entice me and drag me into its world. Restriction are ever present from very start, the game design focused on pushing you to spend money on microtransaction. Quests are bland and uninspiring to a point where you dont read the flavor text and just auto-run (game feature) to location where you kill stuff.\n\nI can not recommend this game for people that are looking for next ARPG title either seeking novelty, refreshment or just to kill some time. There are better alternatives on the market in both paid for and free to play categories.","December 19, 2015","false","27.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The first friendly players being attacked, you can't help. Nothing is interactive. Again Diablo had chest to open and booby traps to watch out for... back in 97.\n\nMusic is pretty bland "epic fantasy" score type, just without anything to set it apart and a lot of this is on the game not setting up anything memorable to endear the songs to you.\n\nLoot drops are pathetic. Half the time I couldn't even hear them and you only get drops on the "bigger" monsters which are super easy so basically they don't know how to pace a game and just are spawning a bunch of nothings for you to kill, probably added at the last minute because the play loop between encounters isn't very fun.\n\nThe art and tech seem to be there but this has all the feel of being designed by some guys that were on a team that made a great game and got lead roles even though they didn't make that first game great and so you have this...","December 16, 2015","false","0.7"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","9","18","2","0"

Devilian... think side scroller hack and slash fun times especially if you play with other players maybe but Devilian, you should have taken more notes from Symphony of the Night. ya no need for camera mode revamp if you just make a patch that creates a nice autolock-on feature to help actually hit the enemies because I am having a difficult time aiming my spells at the enemies and like say my lightning bolt has ten seconds on cooldown or something it keeps shooting the wrong way helllppp ppllleeaaassee ;p\n\nFinal first look analysis: ok it looks kool pretty much like the art makes me feel like I'm doing Dark Blood Online which is nice since Dark Blood went Offline (sad face, also Dark Blood allowed joystick controll btw)  yeah can't knock this ♥♥♥♥ if they're giving it away right? well guess again! i friggin hate the dang christmas music in the castle, turn that $%% the hell off! I'm gonna go play some of these other games i can kick back and use the controller on until the xmas is over and you update that, plenty other awesome games, I recommend checking out Snail's new Black Gold Online also for free to play, the guys who made Age of Wushu did something crazy with flying dragon mounts and robots and there is a mouse look / camera turn function to look at the slightly buggy beautiful artworks in high detail with a new custom designed and self built mid atx tower I have decided to call her The Stealth Ninja Assassin 5000 it's a beast and quiet as hell xD coming for you in the dead of night so sleep tight","December 21, 2015","true","6.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

This is unavoidable in the "run-of-the-mill" area, every MMO you play will be the same as WoW, just like WoW got its ideas from the First Everquest, BUT they arent mimmicing WoW, take for instance Rift, its basicly WoW, but the enemys, races, factions, bosses, dugeons, and a... idk what its called anymore, but you can turn into a giant. K thats what sets Rift away from WoW. Now this game does not mimmic WoW, if anything it mimmics the diablo series, again this has something that sets it appart. ANY MMO is going to have farming, and yes i agree some games have a ♥♥♥♥ drop rate for most items (warframe) again, this is unavoidable.\nLASTLY the game came out a little over a month ago (idk if its listed release date is just related to steam or not) so give it time. never has there been a game thats perfict when it first comes out\n\nIM BACK and im legit rating this, and yes i am leaving the upper part if it lets me.\n\nOK Devilian is a Epic game, like i said before it reminds me of the Diablo Serise, but if Diablo did this i porlly would have played it more lol. Graphics are awesome, i have a loend PC that wich i built my self and it runs the game beutifly. K there IS lag but its the kind where everything stops momenterily and continues like nothing was wrong, but you can deal with that lol and they are working for fix it momentarily. K the Friend System is new, instead of it just being a regular friend list, it lists people that are recomended and you can send free ♥♥♥♥ to them and they can send you free ♥♥♥♥, along with that you earn affinity which in turn allows more free ♥♥♥♥ to be sent WIN/WIN. Community is awesom, quests arent really repeditive, bosses are huge as ♥♥♥♥. and AND there are SO MANY EXPLOSIONS... eh sorry.

This system is one of the worst systems created by game developers and is squarely aimed at driving revenue up by forcing the player base to at least login daily or miss out on gifts and goodies.  Now, the counter argument is that nearly every game has a system like this and I don't disagree.  But what makes other systems not so despised is that they incent and reward, not penalize.  What do I mean?  Daileys of any sort reward the player who commits to doing them, but you don't lose anything for not doing them.  It may accelerate your acquisition of skills or gear, but it doesn't stick a carrot in front of your face to pull it away as your mouth gets within chomping distance.  Devlian's login reward system penalizes you for missing a day of activity.  That is, the 7 day, 14 day or 21 day rewards require consecutive logins.  Work late one night and miss the login...*WHAMMIE*   Get sick and don't play one day...*WHAMMIE*  Forget?  *WHAMMIE*.  Go away on vacation...*DOUBLE WHAMMIE*.\n\nTake a lesson from all top grossing games...none of them has a penalty system for not logging in that is so in your face.  Clash of Clans, the king of mobile games doesn't, but you do stand to lose resources if you don't collect/spend them as you'll be attacked.  Top MMO of 2015, ESO, has daily writs to accelerate your crafting skills and daily Undaunted Pledges (dungeons) but that too just accelerates.  It doesn't penalize.\n\nWhen devs do this, I leave.  Why?  Simple...they admit to not being confident that their game will hold a player's attention and thus need a required daily login system, the carrot and stick, to attempt to retain a player base.\n\nThere are so many games to choose from these days, my time AND money goes to the confident developers who let their content stand for itself.","January 18","false","15.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I'm a big fan of the ARPG-genre, and yes, I even enjoyed Diablo 3 quite a lot. Path of Exile, Marvel Heroes, Torchlight 1 and 2, Sacred 1 and 2, they are all very good games. When I first found this game, I wasn't sure what to expect, but I set my hopes to very low. And know what? I was still disappointed.\n\nWhere do we even begin? The characters are as generic as they get. Monsters and levels? Boring as hell. Been there, done that. The MMO-bit? Pointless. Gathering loot? I didn't see the point. The ARPG-genre is pretty much built around gathering loot, and when even that failed, I didn't see much hope for this game. It would be like a FPS-game without guns. Or a racing game where you race around in shopping carts. Actually, that would have been a lot of fun. Racing downhill in a shopping carts, SSX style. Brilliant, but so not the point here.\n\nI've made it to three hours in this game, and that's three hours I honestly think I wasted. But if that means you won't, it was worth it.

Check it bottom for more info.\n\nThe questing: (at least main quests "story" mode) are basically just going forward,\nthere isn't much take Y quests go do it in X spot go back to Y;\nrather pushing you to new dungens and new places all the time which I personally\nfind refreshing to see in MMO's so I give that 7/10\n\nThe sound and graphics: So far so good, there are glitches and sounds are\nordinary like, but overall its a good sound design, its just bit dull and repetative, same goes\nfor graphic design and graphics in general, nothing new to see here, move along.  6/10\n\nIf you add SweetFX to the game it can really clean up that\nfoggy look and overall feel and give it a nice boost.

It falls somewhere in between. There are quest to be done and It is not quite as linear as Diablo but most certainly not as in depth as PoE. The skill tree is simple yet allows diversity between two people playing the same class. There are a lot of elements of this game that fit the stereotypical MMORPG, however there are enough new and different things about it that are very enjoyable. If you are looking for an MMORPG that is free and has interesting combat to it this not a bad one to try.","December 10, 2015","true","0.1"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","8","17","0","0"

The gem store isnt really p2w as its the same as in every Trion game you can buy cosmetics and like boosts but those arent really necessary for "winning the game", nothing you find in the gem store gives you power but the gem store is quite lacking atm so save your gems for some swagger mounts straight from the RIFT mount collection. It even has PVP which i wont try untill max level. There is lots of completion to be had here since there are really many titles you can earn from special achievements and other rewards for daily challenges etc. If you have ever liked any arpg or mmo with grinding i think you should try this as its f2p so you have nothing to lose. Auto run is pretty stupid though so you will probably never explore the world yourself, hit auto run kill mobs repeatx999 but thats the grindy part. The leveling part is actually far too easy but so is every mmos leveling phase but a casual fun game can be good to play every now and then, hope the max level dungeons are really hard where you wipe multiple times before you learn from your mistakes and conquer the dungeon. I recommend to try like the first 20levels before you say anything as its pretty much tutorial untill you unlock your awakening. And most of the negative reviews here are because people are afraid of 3rd party launchers which is stupid and pointless and because of people think its a f2p p2w game which is very incorrect.","December 11, 2015","true","114.6"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

You can buy power in many ways and you will have to spend money to be competitive (your account will have locked features unless you at least buy something for starters) it's just not the worse kind (still bad), and you can buy from other players for in game gold, think like your usual gameforge Cash shop (aion tera).\n\nSo first of all this game isn't bad, but is it good ?\nWell it's alright i guess, but the thing is every single thing about it is terribly generic, skins, quests, skills, specs, content.\nEvery single thing in this game is your average generic mmo content you've seen a thousand time before.\nAll of those things are ok no more no less, there isn't one single thing to set it apart from your average crowd.\n\nThe game is teribly easy, and i checked on friends that actually like the game enough to get to "end game" and it will never ever get "hard" mechanicaly speaking. Same fights, same mechanics same bosses same everything, the only difference is that for super "high end" stuff you will need to gear up to be able to deal with the content, it doesn't get any harder, it's just that if you don't have the required resists numbers you will die because unavoidable damage will one shot you and you don't deal enough damage, once you grind yourself to the gear required you will faceroll stuff just like you did before.\n\nNow for the publisher should you give Trion a second chance ? For me it's a big no thank you, why ?\nFirst of all the big fiasco, people on the first (of the only 2) servers just loged in one day after the official launch to find all their gear and progress had magically vanished, couldn't use skills either, it took them a day to start fixing stuff. That alone is ridiculous for me, i played most mmos in the last 15years and that'st the kind of crap i wouldn't expect even from a crappy little studio publishing some cheap ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mmo for the first ever time let alone from a company like Trion... I would expect even notoriously ♥♥♥♥ publishers like aeria or gameforge to not ever ♥♥♥♥ up so bad.\n\nBut ♥♥♥♥ happens right ? That incident aside what can you expect ? Well whiteknights will keep telling you this game isn't p2w like they do in every single game ever anyway but what exactly can you really expect ?\nWell what is and isn't p2w seem to be pretty vague depending on people so i'll let you judge wether you consider it to be p2w or not i'll just tell you what is in the cash shop:\nYou will find all kind or things that will make you stronger in the shop, talismans give you a lot of stats are a huge grind and needed to be upgraded a lot, conveniently you get boxes that give you the best talismans in the cash shop, armor and weapons get random rolls, so that super rare BiS gear you got after a month of grind will most likely have meh rolls on it, or maybe even *gasp* terrible rolls, like intel for a character that has 0 scaling for intel but rest assured, cash shop items will allow you to reroll that.\nInventory is super tiny and you will need to keep ♥♥♥♥ ton of crafting ingredients potions consumables and so on, luckily the cash shop is there to save you again.\nI could continue for days (litteraly) the amount of stuff that offers tremendous amount of power (yes getting top gear way faster so you can dominate everyone because you are months of progress ahead thanks to your wallet warrior skills is power too) is stagering for such an early stage, and i'm certain from past experience that it will only get worse.\nBut people will say it's not p2w (even though it makes you undeniably stronger) because it can be obtained in game ! yes it "can", for example you may have to jump through a lot of loops for hours to maybe obtain one of those cash shop items as a reward once a day (or week), will that compete with the guy that just buys 1k reset scrolls and get all the best rolls on all of his gear ? Of course, in a year maybe. But you can buy stuff from the cash shop from other players for in game gold ! YaY ! So now not only does that guys have much better progress and gear than you, you also give him all you hard earned gold to try and bridge the gap so he can get even further ahead...\n\nIf you are a super hardcore diablo style game and want a mmo version no matter the cost, well i guess this bootleg version can do if you are ready to gloss over all the ♥♥♥♥ covering it like the cash shop crap, the censorship, server issues, atrocious voice over that you can't even change to the better kr or even thai version because the launcher is unbypassable and will not let you modify anything no matter what. Also for those saying the publisher listen to the players because they removed such an outrageous garbage like the stamina system, well even though every single post i see people complain about the voices and ask for change or alternative the only answer that the devs ever even bothered to give in a stream was along the line of "lol no gtfo" (in corporate speech).","December 15, 2015","false","11.2"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","7","15","0","0"

Yes it is but so are many other games like Diablo 2 and modern mmorpgs like Tera where certain classes are gender locked.\n- Is it P2W? Yes it is in some way, but you can buy DEX from other players for in game money that allows you to buy anything in cash shop.\n\n- Then people are complaining that it does not run smooth and that the game in clunky. This is far from true unless you run it on a potatoe, the animations are amazing, the boss fights are very intresting.\n- The game is far from flawless, but its a fun to play ARPG with MMO elemens. Its free and you can ofcourse always download it and see for your self.\n- So far the Cash shop does not give you a huge advantage, its there yes and you will get stronger then others if you use it, I myself are a very compedetive person and I don't like games where you have to spent 100s of dollars to compete, but so far I have not felt anoyed by it. Normaly I find myself buying a lot of items in P2W games, and I have 30 dollars on my Steam account that I don't know where to spent on in game (which is good in my opinion)\n\nI rate it a 8.5/10 (at this moment)","December 11, 2015","true","53.4"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrBubblesTea/recommended/407510/","MrBubblesTea","Mr. Bubbles Tea","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrBubblesTea/","93 products in account","So I like this game. Like, a lot. I think I'm gonna be playing this for a while.\nI did have an issue where the game crashed once, but otherwise it worked perfectly.\n\n\nMy pros:\n--------------------\n\n1) The framerate stayed constantly smooth at 60 fps.\n\n2) It looks pretty.\n\n3) The loot system isn't super insane so you don't end up with like fifty things of the same chestplate right at the beginning of the game.\n\n4) The combat is really fluid.\n\n5) Hits feel impactful so it feels like you're actually doing something.\n\n6) They know there are people who like WASD versus mouse clicking so they included both movement types. This isn't exactly innovative but it's nice they did it.\n\n7) It's pretty easy to start a party, add a friend, and play together.\n\n8) The classes aren't ridiculous like other fantasy MMORPGs.\n\n\n\nMy cons:\n--------------------\n\n1) It can be intimidating at first, there's a lot of information that pops up suddenly when you're in town.\n\n2) The enemies seem more like training dummies than enemies (at least in the lower levels).\n\n3) The training area pretty much overpowers your character for the first town so it feels less like you're being involved in the game's progression and more like you're being taken for a ride.\n\n4) The game can crash without real warning. I think I hit J when it crashed the one time it happened to me. I haven't lost any progress or items after crashing but some people have claimed to so be careful.\n\n5) There's only four classes and each is gender/race locked. So if you want to be a ranged character either you're a female mage or a loli sharpshooter. That doesn't detract from the overall experience as much, but this can be a turn-off for some people.\n\n\n\nThe verdict:\n--------------------\n\nIf you're not used to Diablo-esque games this can be intimidating, at first. But if you give it a chance and take it all in it can be quite fun, especially with friends. If you have a decent enough PC the game can look really good as well as run at a solid 60fps. The actual combat, however fluid, can be kind of boring. But it's always satisfying as a mage to send out a fireball and kill five crabs at once and see their bodies fly away in all directions. If you're a fan of Diablo 3, this game should feel similar. And for those of you who like Diablo but can't afford Diablo 3, this is a good free alternative.","December 13, 2015","true","2.8"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","4","9","2","0"

That sounds terrible if you know what you are talking about, but I have got to say the gameplay is there. I might not be a big fan of the art style, however gameplay is what makes a game like this, and it has it. its got the hack and slash loot based gameplay that reminds me very much of Diablo 3. The story may be lackluster, and the actually "devil transformation" seems tacked on and pretty pointless, but overall the shooting, the chopping, the casting, the core juicy guts of the gameplay has my seal of approval. There are currently four classes to play, and tons of abilities to use!\n\nFor those pay to win concerns I know many of you are wondering, I have not seen anything yet. Thats not to say its not there, just that I have yet to encounter something blatantly pay to win.

Of course it's a grindy game, but somehow it's very addictive, fun to play & kill time. Just completely ignore story line and play the game you should like it, because i think end game PvP should be fun. Also this game is not P2W as far as i know, its just Pay For Convenience (short cuts in-game, no added advantages).\n\nTo sum up, remember that this game is free, so don't judge it too much.

However, just because you can crib from other games, it doesn't make the game fun.\n\nThis game tries it's best to be Diablo III with a distinctively Trion/RIFT artstyle. The problem is that the game itself tends to try too hard to cosplay as other games without actually bringing anything new. I know people hate F2P/Pay2Win -- and really, $75 of DLC is a bit excessive, and that's before you even get into the in-game store for consumables, pets, and cosmetics -- but the game IS actually fun. For a bit. Like every TRION game, it's fun as a new experience, but it eventually fades to a distinct "meh." Once boredom sets in, and it will, you'll be glad you didn't pay for it.\n\nThe biggest issue, though? Lag and disconnects, and you'll have them in abundance. Within a two hour stint and 25 levels, I've been kicked from an instance three times, and the chat was flooded with others complaining about lag and DC's, as well. If nothing else, this game desperately begs for an EARLY ACCESS tag.","January 24","false","5.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

It was a Friday night, I was bored, kids were in  bed and looking to kill an hour or two. I'd heard a bit about the game, but knew next to nothing and frankly never intended to play more than a couple minutes of it.\n\nAll of a sudden it's been 40+ hours and I'm amazed and having a blast.\n\nWhile this gets compared to D3 or Path of Exile, it really is nothing like these games. In some many ways this is finally the ARPG I've been waiting for.\n\nI play with a Steam Controller, and it works like a charm. Once again, almost exactly what I have been looking for. Look the game is a bit grindy I guess, and the narrative is nothing to get excited about, but the gameplay is just pure fun.\n\nAt the end of the day what keeps me playing is just running and killing and leveling and looking forward to gearing up because it's just plain fun. I never enjoyed the click clicking of PoE or D3 all that much. They might have a better storyline or a bit more depth to character development, but none of that matters if it's not fun.\n\nAnd this game is.\n\nThere's just so much here and after you get past the first couple hours, the game world opens up and there's more depth than I had ever expected.\n","December 15, 2015","true","72.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","40","2","5","2","0"

Not circle jerking in anger about anything else.\n\nGood:\nGraphics are great\nactive community\ncombat is satisfying as melee & range/magic\nmusic is great\natmosphere is usually spooky which I love\ntalents to personalize the types of attacks you will make as well as modify the talents themselves with passive upgrades\nauto-run (yes, I actually love this)\nvery fun, addictive gameplay\n\nBad:\nOnly 2 character slots available\ncharacter customization is kind of eh, but for this kind of game it really doesn't matter IMO\ngender locked classes, I really hate that in any game\nthis is nothing new, it has been done before, this is basically Path of Exil + DII/DIII with a bit of Aion look to it\nYes, it's Trion.  The people that ruined ArcheAge.  And I mean R-U-I-N-E-D.\n(Ok, I know I said I wouldn't rag on them but I actually paid to be a founder for that game which I -NEVER- do and I loved it so much and they just took it to an orgy in a filthy hobbo town where no one wants to be let alone give money to.)\n\n-------------------------\ntl;dr it's fun, it isn't anything new but it is a very fun distraction/time killer.  I saw no huge problems with bots OR spammers, I had no problem playing, leveling up, doing dungeons, etc. because the game never asked me for anything after I logged in.\nI think the people screaming their mincy little heads about it are either lying or incredibly stupid.  It's just a 'been there, done that' type of game that is easy to play while you watch Netflix on your tablet.","December 16, 2015","true","9.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

I saw no huge problems with bots OR spammers, I had no problem playing, leveling up, doing dungeons, etc. because the game never asked me for anything after I logged in.\nI think the people screaming their mincy little heads about it are either lying or incredibly stupid.

It is a truly great game, because it has a similar feel to other mmorpgs, but is different enough to not get bored.\n\nOne thing I do not like about the game is that the classes are gender locked.","March 1","true","23.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kynji/recommended/407510/","Kynji","Kynji","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kynji/","237 products in account","I recommend this as a free-to-play game only--it's an interesting diversion that plays very similarly to Diablo 3.\n\nThere are a few oddities, the first of which you'll encounter is gender-locked classes (and only 4 of them at that). There's very little character customization and the game allows you to freely change your skill trees at will with no penalty, so you certainly won't get too attached to your character.\n\nThe quests are straightforward and leveling is QUICK--it'll take you 30 hours or less to hit max level. There are a few interesting dungeon mechanics I haven't seen before but there's nothing groundbreaking in this game. This is an MMO-lite; play for fun, when you need a diversion from a heavier game, or something to play with a friend when you don't want to spend a dime.\n\nI haven't (and won't) spent any cash on this game though I have purchased something from Trion in the past; my understanding is that if you haven't you can't access even the auction house. The only thing tempting to purchase is more inventory space as you start with so little it's almost painful.\n\nThis could be a much more interesting game, but as I said, it's an MMO-lite. Light on customization, light on content, light on difficulty. Some strange choices like the gender-locked classes, at will skill changes, and the inability to click on your skills to use them (you must use the numbered hotkeys). Devilian mode is also shockingly weak, making it less of an interesting aspect of the game and more of a strange add-on that the game could do without.\n\nPerhaps in a year this game will have had a lot more content added and become something more than what it is now, but for now, play as a diversion when you're waiting for something else to come along.","January 17","true","34.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Most I would assume are bent out of shape Blizztards who fan boy out about Diablo 3. Dont get me wrong I play D3 just as much as the next and love it but I am open minded when it comes to other games in this genre.\nI felt the game was more MMO than RPG, the combat felt more MMO styled instead of more like Diablo for instance, its still fun but a little slow for my tastes. The game seems very well put together and has great graphics, though the voices when spoken dont have mouth movements to go along with it. not sure if that is something that will be added later or thats just how it is? I thought having more than 4 main skills/attacks was nice unlike other RPG's, it seems to be more advanced in  that area, the skill trees are easy to understand and use. It seems the crafting system is very complex though and very deep, atleast as much as I could get into it so far. All in all I think this game has alot of potential and should be looked at for its pros and not picked apart for every con you can find. Now a days the bar has been set so high for games but remember this is made by Bluehole Studios which I believe is more indie and not something big like Blizzard, etc.  I think its a great FTP game and everyone should give it a try!","December 14, 2015","true","1.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Nice to have a Diablo type of game that is also an MMO.  Graphics are nice, combat is fun, leveling is on the fast side.  Downside - limited to 2 characters per server  (free account), 4 classes (soon to be 5), this also causes another issue, there are 2 servers so you will only be able to play 4 of the 5 classes without spending real money to buy another slot.\n\nOverall I would recommend the game.

It has a nice after level cap system so your exp don't get wasted after you reach level cap. It does get grindy after u reach level cap tho, since u basicly do a lot of dungeon runs to get gems etc to upgrade your gear. Also the in-game store items are kinda expensive in my opinion but in the end, I'd say that this game is definitely worth playing.","December 28, 2015","true","146.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I've only played an hour of this game, but that's all I need. Just a few things about this game:\n\n1. Reminds me of diablo, but with open world rather than finding a party of 4. This makes this game amazing already.\n\n2. The gameplay is way smooth.\n\n3. Awakening devilian is pretty sick. Adds more skills for a short time.\n\nThis game is definitely worth a try.

I played the alpha, and currently have a level 30 in the game.\n\nDespite the negative reviews here on Steam, this game really isn't bad. Playing this game with a friend or two is enjoyable, and it could be enjoyable for anyone who liked the click-and-kill playstyle of Torchlight or Diablo. Of course, this game doesn't offer the depth that Diablo does (it's a F2P MMO ARPG), and there's really no point in reading the quest logs or trying to follow the story (the voice acting is bad, and the story is just another fantasy do-gooder story). But there's a good bit of content to the game. Leveling is not that bad of a grind compared to other F2P games like TERA, and the zones change graphically and consistently. Each zone has something unique about it, which is refreshing, and there is a variation to the monsters within the game. The quests also have variations, changing from kill quests, to collect quests, to dungeons, and to doing A-then-B. But really, how much questing variation can there be in a top-down MMO?\n\nIt's also not "pay to win", like most people would find joy in whining about. You can either pay for XP-Gold boosts, cosmetics, and other items - or you don't. No one is forcing you to buy anything, and there are no things to buy that would up your DPS, health, or other stats over anyone who didn't buy them. Unless looking different is a stat. Like most other F2P companies, the creators of Devilian are trying to make a living from what they have spent their time and money on to make. It's mostly children whining about the inhumanity of having to pay for something that someone else has created for you to enjoy. Shocking. It's a growing concern that this is a hard lesson for children to learn. So, don't let the F2P model of Devilian turn you off from the game.\n\nIf you're looking for a F2P, Torchlight/Diablo-esque MMOARPG, then go for it. Devilian may not have the depth you want, but it may fill that gap for a while. I can't comment on the end-game content or the PVP, because I have not reached it yet, but I understand the game has an endless dungeon and heroic-mode dungeons, as well as PVP tier items and rewards - so the content is there. If you don't know what you're looking for, but enjoy F2P games, then you should also try Devilian, because it is one of the better F2P games that I have tried. The dungeons are fun, and you can even solo them if you want. Character customization is as deep as you make it, because there are cards you can choose to buff you character, and there are max-level "perks" you can put points in to (similar to Diablo 3's max-level perks). The skill-trees are interesting, and you can put points into multiple trees at a time, rather than being forced to pick from only one tree.\n\nHowever, there have been server issues on the EU side that I did not experience (I have been playing on the US server), but I have heard of them. While it is a shame that these issues happened, please understand that this happened on the second day of an MMO's launch. While these issues are not great, fun, or acceptable - they happen. I've played MMO's for years, and I expect these things to happen, regardless of wanting them to. Please note that this issue shouldn't define the entire game as being bad, and please take negative reviews that are based solely on this issue with a grain of salt.","December 14, 2015","true","25.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This game is a very good MMO. Yes, maybe you can't choose your gender nor race but atleast you get to personnalise your character a bit.\n\nThe things a like the most in this MMO is the fighting. I heard some people say it's too mechanic or something like that but it isn't at all. It's fluid and pretty cool. But it can be buggy sometimes. Like, you get hit but you are not within their hitting zone.\n\nPeople have been saying that it's a P2W game. It isn't. Don't listen to them. I've played a good couple of hours and I haven't came across any real money deals yet.... yet. I do know that you can have 2 characters and then you have to pay to get more and also pay to get more inventory slots but at the same time. The devs have got to make a living! It's not like you have to buy the game for 50£ or $ or whatever. Anyway if you on't want to pay anything. Do what I do and ignore it. This isn't SWTOR where you have to pay money just to get the good gear.\n\nNow for the pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n+Good Graphics\n+Fluid Combat Mechanics\n+Borderlands Style Skill Tree\n+It Doesn't Get Boring Questing (For Some It Might)\n+Unique Second Form System And Point System\n+A Much Needed AutoRun To Quests\n\nCons:\n-Characters Mouths Are Immobile\n-Genders Are Locked (Not that Big Of A Problem)\n-Can Be Buggy At Some Points\n-Rare Bugs With Hits\n\nP.S. If any one of you feels affended by women wearing almost nothing (Yes, apparently people do get affended by that. I don't know how they cope in the bedroom) then... Don't play this game.\n\n8/10 (For the combat bugs) Would play and recommend again!","December 13, 2015","true","25.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

Most I would assume are bent out of shape Blizztards who fan boy out about Diablo 3. Dont get me wrong I play D3 just as much as the next and love it but I am open minded when it comes to other games in this genre.\nI felt the game was more MMO than RPG, the combat felt more MMO styled instead of more like Diablo for instance, its still fun but a little slow for my tastes. The game seems very well put together and has great graphics, though the voices when spoken dont have mouth movements to go along with it. not sure if that is something that will be added later or thats just how it is? I thought having more than 4 main skills/attacks was nice unlike other RPG's, it seems to be more advanced in  that area, the skill trees are easy to understand and use. It seems the crafting system is very complex though and very deep, atleast as much as I could get into it so far. All in all I think this game has alot of potential and should be looked at for its pros and not picked apart for every con you can find. Now a days the bar has been set so high for games but remember this is made by Bluehole Studios which I believe is more indie and not something big like Blizzard, etc.  I think its a great FTP game and everyone should give it a try!","December 14, 2015","true","1.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I played the alpha, and currently have a level 30 in the game.\n\nDespite the negative reviews here on Steam, this game really isn't bad. Playing this game with a friend or two is enjoyable, and it could be enjoyable for anyone who liked the click-and-kill playstyle of Torchlight or Diablo. Of course, this game doesn't offer the depth that Diablo does (it's a F2P MMO ARPG), and there's really no point in reading the quest logs or trying to follow the story (the voice acting is bad, and the story is just another fantasy do-gooder story). But there's a good bit of content to the game. Leveling is not that bad of a grind compared to other F2P games like TERA, and the zones change graphically and consistently. Each zone has something unique about it, which is refreshing, and there is a variation to the monsters within the game. The quests also have variations, changing from kill quests, to collect quests, to dungeons, and to doing A-then-B. But really, how much questing variation can there be in a top-down MMO?\n\nIt's also not "pay to win", like most people would find joy in whining about. You can either pay for XP-Gold boosts, cosmetics, and other items - or you don't. No one is forcing you to buy anything, and there are no things to buy that would up your DPS, health, or other stats over anyone who didn't buy them. Unless looking different is a stat. Like most other F2P companies, the creators of Devilian are trying to make a living from what they have spent their time and money on to make. It's mostly children whining about the inhumanity of having to pay for something that someone else has created for you to enjoy. Shocking. It's a growing concern that this is a hard lesson for children to learn. So, don't let the F2P model of Devilian turn you off from the game.\n\nIf you're looking for a F2P, Torchlight/Diablo-esque MMOARPG, then go for it. Devilian may not have the depth you want, but it may fill that gap for a while. I can't comment on the end-game content or the PVP, because I have not reached it yet, but I understand the game has an endless dungeon and heroic-mode dungeons, as well as PVP tier items and rewards - so the content is there. If you don't know what you're looking for, but enjoy F2P games, then you should also try Devilian, because it is one of the better F2P games that I have tried. The dungeons are fun, and you can even solo them if you want. Character customization is as deep as you make it, because there are cards you can choose to buff you character, and there are max-level "perks" you can put points in to (similar to Diablo 3's max-level perks). The skill-trees are interesting, and you can put points into multiple trees at a time, rather than being forced to pick from only one tree.\n\nHowever, there have been server issues on the EU side that I did not experience (I have been playing on the US server), but I have heard of them. While it is a shame that these issues happened, please understand that this happened on the second day of an MMO's launch. While these issues are not great, fun, or acceptable - they happen. I've played MMO's for years, and I expect these things to happen, regardless of wanting them to. Please note that this issue shouldn't define the entire game as being bad, and please take negative reviews that are based solely on this issue with a grain of salt.","December 14, 2015","true","25.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The support is extremely fast and professional, while it is possible to improve aspects of the progress (like inventory size, mounts and small boosts) it is a true free to play game, free of pay 2 win aspects.

Rewarding and smooth combat.\n\nThe Bad:\nHowever, several hours into the game I was greatly disappointed by this game due to poor class balancing and total negligence from Trion to  the ingame community (this was to be expected, seeing what Trion did to ArcheAge). Addressing the poor class balancing, Evokers and Cannoneers dominate the rankings in PVE and PVP, if you play anything other than these classes; expect to struggle in the long-run. The devs did announce to rebalance the game in one of their streams sometime in January, however that is all unknown at this point seeing how Trion historically handled it's other once popular MMOs. The game itself has few hiccups, and at times can be laggy. You're also limited to just creating two characters, and will need to purchase slots from the cash shop.\n\nLastly, gearing up in the higher levels is an absolute pain, currently butchery gear is the best in the game and has an incredibly low drop rate.\n\nConclusion:\nWith the game being the way it is now, I cannot recommend this game to casual players let alone hardcore players.

I only installed it via Steam so I could write a review here. The time displayed here does not represent the time I have actually played the game.\n\nI can't understand how so many people like this game. But I guess it's because MMORPG player don't have high standards...\nThat's the only explanation I have.\n\nSo, when I started the game, I was greated with an object, eh, I mean 'woman' with breast plate and what's even worse: bouncing boobs.\n\nYay! Another game that treats me as if I'm a pubertal white young male that will be a virgin forever! But what did I expect? From the developers of TERA...\n\nNice. Well, I know how MMOs are. I gave it a chance. A game can have flaws but can still be enjoyable.\n\nBut the next thing wasn't great either.\n\nWhen in the character creation, your gender depends on which class you choose. On top of it, there's even a class were you play as a little girl, for those pedophiles MMORPG developers like to pander.\n\nI choose the shadowhunter, as it was the most interesting class for me (and because I didn't wan't to play as an object.)\nThe other classes where Berserker, Magician and Gunner I think. Nothing new here.\n\nThen there was a tutorial level, in which an object, eh, I mean 'woman' helped me. Said woman gets kidnapped, we get another object as a companion to rescue the woman who was our company before, then she moaned in a manner where\nI thought again 'I'm not 12 years old!' and that was all what had to be done in this completely unnecessary tutorial level.\n\nUnnecessary because the game is extremly easy. Just smash your head on your keybeard.\n\nAfter that the player gets to Tristam. Eh, I mean, some town resembling Tristam a tiny bit, because Devilian copied Diablo, eh, I mean they were 'influenced' by Diablo...\n\nWell, and here begins the typical looting, leveling and grinding part.\n\nThe fights are actually kinda fun, but much too easy and boring.\n\nAt the end of the day Devilian is really not worth playing.\n\nIt's boring, has nothing new, is just like any other MMORPG out there and is in some aspects even worse.\n\nSo, if I want to play Diablo, then I play Diablo or similiar games like Sacred, Torchlight or Titan Quest.\n\nAnd if I want to play MMORPGs then I rather play AION, Neverwinter, TESO, ArcheAge or Guild Wars 2.\n\nBut I surely don't want to waste my time with Devilian.\n\nI also wrote a review on my tumblr, with some screenshots of said objects and some quotes to show what other people from the ingame chat said about this game.\nIt's here if you want to see it: http://jenny-jester.tumblr.com/post/134007245285","December 16, 2015","false","0.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The Plus: it's got nice graphics, lots of action, easy to follow quests and it's free to play. The Minus: It takes a lot of time to figure out the elixirs, enchantments etc. and the "help" section isn't that detailed. All-in-all its a great game to play and once you start you may find it hard  to stop.\n\n3/3/2016 Updated Review:\nContinue to play this game and now have a Tempest Class that I am enjoying leveling up. The only negative I can find at this time is that the Guilds seem to be a little lopsided on power, structure and ability to get dedicated players to really participate, but its not that big of a negative to make the rest of the game unenjoyable. With the new dungeons, higher character levels and other things that have been recently added its definitely a great game!","February 1","true","344.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The leveling curve starts off extremely quickly, and then slows down as you approach your 30's. Not too slow, and there is never a grind. It mixes the elements of a traditional ARPG and classic MMO together well. The only gripe is that it's supposed to be a Hybrid ARPG, but there isn't enough random loot. It's the typical asian mmo in that every piece of gear is tiered by "levels" and they all have the exact same name. Instead of wasting time looking at all the gear, I wish they had an "of the xxxx" to know what kind of stat allocation was on the piece of gear. I really love that each class has 3 tree's to go in and every single one of them have their uses. Being able to respec for free at anytime is amazing, even while out in the field.\n\nSo far I haven't found the need to spend any money at all. The negative reviews I read about this game kind of was putting me off, but I don't see anything at all in regards to what people's complaints are. Of course theirs going to be a grind at 52 to get the best gear, kind of part of ANY MMO and ARPG alike. Ever played Diablo and done 500+ gear runs to finally get 1 piece of useful upgrade. It's what draws us players to these types of games. Dungeons are very quick and rewarding, and earning tokens in previous area's don't go to waste if you have extras as you can spend 3 tokens to get 2 for the next area allowing you to progress gear wise while leveling very easily. The bosses in the dungeons while not "hard" have fun mechanics and makes everything seem like a controlled chaos. The animations, and the combat are what make this game flat out amazing. I'm playing with my 8 year old and he loves the game, and my wife who typically stays away from mmo's wants to play. The game draws you in quickly, I just got into the game for the first time a few days ago and already have 46 hours invested.\n\nIf you're looking for a great ARPG style game that's also an MMO, this is the game to check out. It seriously reminds me of Diablo 2, but a constant player base running around, rather than having to be on battle.net and find rooms. My only complaint is the chat system, but it's typical for all asian mmo's. The need for microphones to talk in open channels is really bleh. I get why they do it, but I'd rather deal with bot spammers than be hindered when I may have questions. My recommendations for keyboard settings is set to classic mmo using wasd, and remove the ability to click to move and set your combo building to mouse 1. If you don't you end up spamming 1 18 million times an hour and gets very tiring. It's almost impossible with click to move to click on targets and attack on mouse click. The only way I found a way around it was to set shift+click to allow using mouse click without moving, but it's more of a chore than using wasd and removing click to move.","February 8","true","52.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you play PvE mainly the game is fairly balanced. If you play PvP you cannot be competitive unless you spend hundreds of dollars on talisman boxes. I also hate the genderlocked classes. All in all it brings nothing new, although the PvP is fun but just requires too much money to be competitive. Also if you want to upgrade your artifacts you MUST buy a ton of enigma keys in order to MAYBE get a bunch of gems from an enigma box. Other than that it would take you literally years and years to find enough of the gems to upgrade your artifacts to anything past level 7.

Move, smash some buttons to do the skills, kill the mobs, get the ocasiona loot, you know, that stuff.\nThe skills and animation aren't that bad either. I picked the chain-rogue like class (can't really remeber the name), and it had some really nice animation, with long chains and enormous blades coming out from my body. The gameplay itself didn't felt really smooth, it was always feeling like i'm moving a bit to slow than i should have done, always felt like my attacks were being delivered a fraction of second later than they should've done. I also had a dodge ability, with actually felt pretty useless since everytime i had to dodge an attack, the animation of my character felt to slow to actually manage to do it.\nAlso, while most of the MOARPG are usually instanced, this game actually had an 'open word-ish' map, which basically was just a slighty larger corridor than the usual dungeons that we usually see, and yeah, they were open world which meant that there were other players questing around you. And this, felt incredibly frustrating since being this an MOARPG, it's normal to clear big packs of mobs relatively quickly, so it was always a pain in the ♥♥♥ to manage to do that 'kill 5 generic mobs' quest, since i passed more time looking for the mobs instead of actually killing them (same for gathering quests). Also, the quests itself were really really generic, 'kill x mobs, gather x things, talk to x' and so on, being also that, atleast in the starting area, the mobs were always the same but slighty bigger or of a different color, so it really felt like doing the same thing over and over again.\nAround lvl 10 (or 11, can't remember exactly) you get acces to the 'talents tree', where you have to pick from 3 specializations, only that it isn't really a tree, but most like a branch, since you are forced to pick one skill, and then you have the option to choose from which of 2 aspects of this skill upgrade (like -2 energy cost, or +10 damage).\nAround lvl 12, i got to the first dungeon, in which i felt no difference at all from the normal questing area: it was just a long map, where i had to kill a bunch o mobs untill i got to the final boss. It wasn't even harder that the usual, but actually easier since i had an npc helping me.\nSo yeah, i got pretty bored of the game. It's not really bad, it's just REALLY generic.\nOthervise than beeing a 'I don't recommend this game' review, this would actually be a very 'meh!' review","December 11, 2015","false","1.5"," 13 of 28 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","13","28","0","0"

A game that almost works, but not quite. That is because one significant design choice reallt hurts the gameplay: Attacks Always Hit.\nThere are skill shots in the game, both friendly and hostile, and they are the attacks that hit like a truck, but alongside these skillshots are attacks that follow the target, and automatically hit, If anybody swings a sword, it doesn't matter if the target leaves melee distance, that melee attack hits. If a witch attacks you with a ranged attack, no amount of dodging will stop her homing missle of free damage.\nThis is a sacrifice made, I am assuming, to combat latency, allowing for the experience of an Isometric Action RPG with many people all over the world. But in my opinion this sacrifice was too high of a cost. I can ignore a bad story: not saying this has a bad story. I can look past an artistic direction I do not care for: not saying it looks bad. But I do not want to slug through unsatisfying gameplay, and to me, the introduction of auto-hit attacks makes the game unsatisfying.\n\nAs a Hardcore (Perma-death) Diablo player, this made the gameplay unsatisfying. The rest of the game was enjoyable, but due to my dissatisfaction, I cannot give this game my recommendation.","December 25, 2015","false","4.0"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","0"

As with most RPGs or MMOs for that matter there is  a sliding scale of difficulty that begins to ramp up the higher you get. I think this is to give you an easy arena in which to learn the class you've chosen - but I had to start being careful in dungeons in the lvl 18-20 realm.\n\nI could see this game being repetive but I'm quite surprised to be honest at how fun it was. I've spend 1k hours playing PoE and more than that in D3, and this felt pretty familiar. Combat feels crisp, it appears that there is some depth to the crafting system (too early to tell), and a card system ("talismans") that kind of works like the cards in Warframe. Art is great, and personally I love playing as a tiny girl with a bigass gun. A lot of the mobs do look like they were lifted straight from WoW and D3, and in fact it almost feels like that is what Tirion was going for...the perfect mashup of those two games.\n\nDespite the somewhat derivative feel, it still feels unique enough to where I anticipate logging a few hundred hours, and definitely getting into the end game to see what that is about. I'll update this review after significantly more time playing it, but for now I give it a solid 7/10. It's free, and from what I can tell so far there aren't any mega-game-breaking benefits only available through real money transactions. No reason not to try it, especially for the ARPG/MMO fan and those who like Blizz games.","December 10, 2015","true","33.9"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

That is because one significant design choice reallt hurts the gameplay: Attacks Always Hit.\nThere are skill shots in the game, both friendly and hostile, and they are the attacks that hit like a truck, but alongside these skillshots are attacks that follow the target, and automatically hit, If anybody swings a sword, it doesn't matter if the target leaves melee distance, that melee attack hits. If a witch attacks you with a ranged attack, no amount of dodging will stop her homing missle of free damage.\nThis is a sacrifice made, I am assuming, to combat latency, allowing for the experience of an Isometric Action RPG with many people all over the world. But in my opinion this sacrifice was too high of a cost. I can ignore a bad story: not saying this has a bad story. I can look past an artistic direction I do not care for: not saying it looks bad. But I do not want to slug through unsatisfying gameplay, and to me, the introduction of auto-hit attacks makes the game unsatisfying.\n\nAs a Hardcore (Perma-death) Diablo player, this made the gameplay unsatisfying. The rest of the game was enjoyable, but due to my dissatisfaction, I cannot give this game my recommendation.","December 25, 2015","false","4.0"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","0"

Yes you only get two character slots, but to me that's not a big deal. I am only level 10, so I hope down the road I am not forced to pay to win as you would call it.

I decided to try this game because of all the negative reviews I saw on here. The main gripes were the same as when Archeage launched: I have to wait in a que, I need to prove I’m not a bot, you can get better crap if you pay...blah, blah, blah. Whatever, right? So I played Archeage hardcore … like REALLY hard core--dropped 100$+ in just for a pegasus … yeah you read that right :/ So no plans on dropping money in this game, even for a dope-a** ride, no plans to buy nerd glasses, or wings, or whatnot, so not spending money is no big deal, and I have YET to see a need. Also, I haven’t once had to wait in a que, or prove I’m not a bot … but I did drop all that money into Archeage so I have a validated account already.\n\nSo, on to the game. I first tried out the cannonier, it was cool, but not my style. Then I made a gay looking guy and tried the shadowhunter, he was awesome but I missed my Ellamina, so I made an Evoker. Though I didn’t like the cannonier much all three classes were fun to play, and I never wanted to try berserker so, meh. It is fast paced, kill, kill, kill and easy to play.\n\nSo the breakdown:\n\nWhat is it like?\nImagine PWI, WoW, and Diablo had a baby with a dash of Rusty Hearts, that is my overall take on the game. You have the Diablo like play style with a look of WoW and PWI and all the stuff Rusty Hearts was missing, hence why RH has gone the way of the Dinosaurs--sad face (fingers crossed for RHR).\n\nPros:\nEasy to play\nPretty to look at\nNice options for character building\n\nCons:\nGender locked classes--con if you don’t like that, I don’t care\nPatron perks--haven’t found it to be necessary like it is in Archeage but people may not like that folks will get more for the monthly fee\nOther pay advantages--like I said, I haven’t seen this negatively effect my FTP so not an issue for me but could be a con for others\n\nSo, that’s it, for me this is a 9/10, only 9 because I could see a WANT to spend money in the future as the game grows\n;-P","December 13, 2015","true","2.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Fun fact was that in the first weekend after Devilian´s release they did a manteinance at "Seadrift" server (EU). When game came back people got their bags and warehouse wiped. Everything including lvls. They havent fixed it yet (5 days after) and everything they´ve said is: "We´re doing some researches about the issue". Gotta admit i laught hard about those guys who paid 150$ for a founder pack to lose it cause of Trino. Priceless.\n\n-Worst questing you can find out there. You go from X to Y with the "Autorun" feature, check the mobs you must kill (pointed by the quest), you pull about 20 enemies and you kill´em with 2 AoE attacks. That´s all, no matter your lvl, no matter the zone you´re questing at, doesnt matter. The game is that from lvl 1 to lvl 52.\n\n-PVP is about evokers (mage) pulling people like mobs and spamming AoE to strike pentakills with 2 seconds of damage.

Download the game\n\n2. Download the Patch for the game.\n\n3. Create an Account\n\n4. Log-in\n\n5. Make a character that you want to play throughout the game. If you're not sure, or want to play the best class in the game you can research, but I recommend making all characters and making your prefered class your main. (The one you plan on putting the most effort into)\n\n6. Play through the story, get used to playing your classes and once you decide on your class later on, you should consider looking up some rotations, builds whatever you want to call them.\n\n7. Enjoy the game, take the time to experience it and not rush to end content. Finally, don't go and ruin a game by hacking if you don't like it, just uninstall and forget it exists.\n\n\nI think i've covered everything I wanted to say, I hope to see you in-game, my characters name is "Cyndrical" if you have any questions and i'll assist you the best I can.","December 11, 2015","true","1.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I can say this.....\n\nThe flow of this game just feels amazing to me. Almost diablo-esqueue, mixed with some MMO goodness, and it's own sort of flair. The battle is pretty fluent which is a neccessity to an action rpg (and the lack of this has caused many past action MMOs to bite the dust quick imo). The general "don't stand in fire" rule applies for most boss/super encounters and each class comes with a dodge skill for close calls.\n\nAs for the story-line, I don't know...nor, do I care. If you play MMOs for a storyline driven by artificial intelligence you will have to read another review for insight. I play an MMO for group-driven advancement, and player-vs-player competition. I will be basing my review on this (maybe after the game progresses I will review it again with an opinion on this matter).\n\nInstance queueing is another feauture I enjoyed in Devilian. No waiting 2 hours on a tank and healer in an endless queue.... Queue for an instance and usually you will have a group together rather quickly (atleast as of now....). I also love the fact you can queue for a 20-vs-20 pvp battleground  right after you dive into the game and learn the basic controls.\n\nLove the dark devil characters with two states (you can be your normal state or go Devilian (devil) mode). The devilian state characters had advanced/modified skills, and some other powerhouse skills unique to devilian mode. You can trigger this mode after charging it, or some battlegrounds and events force you to use your Devilian state for the entire instance/event.\n\nOverall its one of the very few free to play games I didn't delete after level 20 of character progression, and will re-review once I have put hours into end-game content.... but download me, try me, love me..... you shouldnt be disappointed if you are into MMORPGs or Action RPGs such as Diablo.","December 17, 2015","true","65.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

Even though it is simple, it is also quite fun. It's easy to get into and learn, and it has a lot to offer.\n\nPersonally, I can't stop playing. I was looking for an MMO to play, similar to Tera or FlyFF, just to scratch an itch. I typically don't go for the free to play games, but the paywall is easy to get around if you play enough. Now I'm logging in everyday for dailies and dungeon crawling, I even started a guild.\n\nLong story short, it's simple, fun, and really scratches that MMO itch. There's nothing to lose, it's free!

These characters you choose are just rejects / recycles of Tera, which was better in my opinion.\n\nYou are allowed minimal customization on a scale that won't matter due to you and everybody else being at an aeriel view 99% of the time. Your eye color or face tattoo that is covered by hair will never be noticed.\n\nYou can put Justin bieber hair on somebody who has the body structre of The Rock(avoiding John Cena meme.)\nThere really isn't anything original to this game, there is way too much boob shaking, in an attempt to appeal to the teen boys who can't hide their porn from their parents.\n\nThe client which switching to Windowed Borderless isn't stable.\n\nThe pros of this game are just simply aesthetic in it's a filler until a better comes along.\n\nYou are gender locked into roles. The Chat and Announcement box are default in the way, and are a bother when you have to run west or south west.\n\nWaste of time essentially. Go play some more D3 or Tera until Lost Ark comes out.","December 14, 2015","false","5.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I feel betrayed.\nEDIT\nso i felt decently compensated with all the coins and stuff we were rewarded to buy back our gear, although now my server has been offline for like 5 days or something daft so cant even play at the moment, definitley still leaving my review as not reccomend due to the amount of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t i have gone through with this game.

This game is very polished, it just dosn't need you that much.\nFrom this perspective the game should be 10/10. And it can be 10/10 to the intended audience, read the bottom paragraph to see why I think the game is unplayable and why it might be for you too.\n\n[PROS]\n+ Wow it feels good to play\n+ Access to explore right after tutorial\n+ Community/Chat is welcoming, funny, helpful\n+ Looks and sounds beautifully, blend of 'Still' painting cinematics and ingame cutscenes.\n\n[CONS]\n- Gender locked classes\n- Typical oversexualization of female characters. yeah I know its in every* MMO but its not an excuse\n- 'Go here and do that thing 4 times' type of questing we are sick and tired of.\n\n\nIT'S TOO DAMN EASY. I choose the gunner class and after the tutorial I went to explore (seems you dont need to quest to progress to new areas, thought there's a limit to that.) Anyways, at first it made sense that it was all easy since y'know the game just started. But then being the masochistic "I must play on the hardest difficulty" player I unequiped all my gear except for the tutorial weapon. WOW was I dissapointed when i beat a boss 4 levels above me. So then I realize the game only needs you to press one button, your basic attack. This is a boss battle we are talking about, whats the point of the beautiful controls and polished skills when you can stand still and basic attack a boss to death with no worries. The game just dosn't need you to try and PERSONALLY that makes the game unplayable to ME.","December 12, 2015","false","1.3"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

So popular infact, the developer Ginno Games decided to shut it down whilst Devilian west was still in beta. That's a good start to a 'new' game. If you love taking the micky out of poor translations, then you will love reading the subtitles for this game if anything.\n\nI have no idea why Trion decided to buy this title, why Trion? I played Devilian when it was in beta, and when they announced the 'founders pack' (yeah that new way of grabbing as much money off over hyped people who haven't played the game yet and want to pay to get into beta, and people who like shiny things to make them feel special compared to everyone else) you just knew this game was going to be a piece of doo-doo.\n\n* Character Creation *\n\nWhat character creation? you have a choice of five different faces and some tattoos, that's it. You can't even change the height or weight of your character, I mean what the hell, what year is this. If this hasn't put you off playing this game, just wait and see.\n\n* Combat *\n\nNothing special here. Get spells, put them on your bar, smash them until your bar goes down and then back up, then smash them again. This hasn't been done before.\n\n* Cash Shop*\n\nWhen you implement a feature where people can buy 'speaker phones' where they can talk to everyone online playing and have no way of hiding it, you're what's wrong with game development. Seriously, if someone speaks in chat with one of these things, you cannot hide it, you will see every stupid word they say (great feature for gold sellers)\n\n* Story *\n\nI watched the cutscenes (the ones you can't skip) and I don't remember a thing.\n\n\nSo yeah, give this game a miss because it will most likely die in a few months or until Trion decides to stop putting money into it and fire a bunch of people. Avoid this piece of rubbish at all costs, go play Rift or something.","December 14, 2015","false","23.7"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

After this game, I will never trust Steams review system ever again. This game is fine. There are complaints "Boo hoo, you need to spend like... 5 dollars to get ahead". What do people expect from free to play games? Just milk that server time, cost the company money, and give nothing in return? FFS, make your own game and make it 100% free. It's so stupid.\n\nThe gameplay is good, like any other ARPG. I like that you can use WASD controls (or mouse if you prefer, I like WASD). It's fast paced. It's an MMO, non instanced like every other ARPG (excluding Marvel Heroes, which is similar). It's easy to get into. There are a lot of quests. There are challenging raids. It's overall a very decent game. Not the greatest in the world, but considering you CAN do everything anyone else can in the game without spending a dime, that's pretty damn good. Overall solid 7 out of 10.\n\nUnfortunately, people will negatively review this game more because they want to fit in with a trend as opposed to giving it a fair review. It's sad that the steam review system has become high school. But that is to be expected when it's primarily occupied by little kids. :) Look at most of the negative reviews and you will notice they all have a similar game in common (for most of them). That should tell you something about how legitimate their reviews are.","February 10","true","3.7"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","3","0","0"

Devilian form feels meh and weak, i mean it should be badass thing right?\n7. Game graphic are rather medium/low, lack of detail, not many nice places to feed your eyes on.\n8. Sound efects are ridiculus. I'm playing berserker and after mashing my main dps skill for hours i got tired of the totaly not epic routine "click --> loud HUA! --> 10 hours leater ---> click loud HUA!" +_+\nThe Neutral\n1. Music\n2. Dungeons - way to easy you just have to AVIOD THE RED CIRCLE OF DEATH. somehow still enjoyable.\nThe good.\nWell combat dont feel clunky that somethings i guess.","December 12, 2015","false","9.6"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","5","14","0","0"

The Devil form is a nice touch, but that's about it. The controls are nice enough, though they do feel a bit clunky.\n\nThe graphics are nothing exceptional but I quite liked them, expecially as I found the world design to be rather well done.\n\nDue to the shared world most quest mobs respawn at ridiculous rates, which makes the leveling process seem even more pointless than the total lack of challenge whatsoever already does.\n\nStory is lackluster as well as the voice acting so far.\n\nDon't really see me putting much more time into this game, since there are quite a few and in my opinion better ARPG alternatives out there. I didn't experience much of the MMO part of this game, which might be its saving grace; the start has, however, been so boring in addition to the troubles actually getting the game to start, that I simply can't be ♥♥♥♥♥ to waste any more time on it.\n\nI'd rate the game slightly below average and since there are so many more, sometimes even free alternatives, I don't reccomend it. If you have a lot of time on your hands or are bored with the above mentioned alternatives, this game won't hurt to try out; simply don't expect much and be prepared for TRION-hijinks, that will eventually be this game's downfall.","December 12, 2015","false","8.4"," 7 of 19 people (37%) found this review helpful","37","7","19","0","0"

But, seeing how this is trion they of course had to ♥♥♥♥ it up. How do you ♥♥♥♥ up a diablo clone you may ask? Let's find out!\n\nFirst off the controls are honestly the worst out of any ARPG I have ever played. Click to move is clearly not the intended way to move, they want you to use WASD... How is click to move clearly not meant to be used you may ask? Simple, holding left click does not result in a smooth running animation it instead causes dozens of little clicks each making your character B line for the new marker. You end up looking like you have parkinsons everytime you need to change direction and it just feels off and wrong. Your character also randomly decides to refuse to listen to the Attack in place key (aka shift) and will constantly charge into what you are trying to attack from a range. Cause after all you're not supposed to play this blatent diablo clone like a diablo game, you need to move with WASD and attack with 1-5 cause we're trion and we have no ♥♥♥♥ing idea how a top down ARPG is supposed to play. While on the subject of Attack in Place, it flat out doesnt work for attacks other than left click. If you try to hold shift while using any other attack your character will flat out refuse and do nothing.\n\nHow you ♥♥♥♥ up controls on a genre that was perfected almost 20 years ago goes to show the dedication Trion has to producing garbage free to play games. Not only that, but how do you ♥♥♥♥ up the controls this badly? My only guess is they simply took a 3rd person engine or game, moved the camera, disabled camera controls, and called it an ARPG. I can see no other reason for WASD movements, an attack in place button that feels like its code is failing to execute 50% of the time, and number keys being the default attack buttons with the mouse buttons not working.\n\nNext up is fun factor. A large portion of the fun from ARPG diablo style games is the shower of loot you get and the excitment of seeing rare drops (before you inevitably find out its useless). Once again trion falls flat on their ♥♥♥♥ing faces. This is a diablo style ARPG with close to no loot. Loot drops at specific points or seems to be so incredibly rare that the only loot I got while playing was from quests. Once again. how you take a very simple game formula and ♥♥♥♥ it up so spectacularly is truly a sight to behold.\n\nOne last point I'd like to touch is trion's need to include fan service classes for pedophiles. I honestly couldnt be more ♥♥♥♥ing tired of these classes designed to look like 8 year old girls in MMOs. I feel like there is one artist working on all these f2p mmos that needs to be in a cell right now. I get how its a big thing in asia but we are not in vietnam or S Korea, and only otaku types find these models anything but horrifying. Not only are these designs creepy they totally lock an entire class behind a pedophile wall.\n\nBut hey, this is Trion. Chances are this is an asian MMO that failed horribly sometime in the past 2-5 years. At which point trion swooped it up, stuck more ♥♥♥♥♥♥ signature mechanics in it and, and released it to the EU NA markets.","December 11, 2015","false","0.5"," 10 of 33 people (30%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","30","10","33","0","1"
