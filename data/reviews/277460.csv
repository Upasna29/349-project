Sort of. But that is besides the point, this is just reminiscing about why it is/was/always will be so good and mostly clearing up some issues that other people have been raising, but enough of the review of the review or the introduction to the introduction, here is the introduction.\n\nThis game was probably one of the best games of my childhood and is now on Steam. Bring on the nostalgia. The game is as excellent as it always was but being an oldie it may have some compatibility issues with modern operating systems, as are the subject of every single negative review here. My advice to the people writing those reviews, before you go ranting and raving about how terrible and broken it is try and fix the problem first and then give the people some advice other than simply "give up".\nThere is an easy solution to those complaints that works for me and a lot of other people have put foward slightly more complicated ones if this one doesn't work-\nSTEP ONE (of one): simply disable the in-game steam interface on Praetorians by right clicking on it in your library, going to Properties, and unchecking the "Enable in-game Steam overlay" box, it won't be hard to find. This will mean that you will be unable to open Steam using shift-tab while in game but the game will run perfectly. If you find the in-game Steam interface so useful on other games that you do not want to disable it then bear in mind that this is an old game and your computer will be able to tab up and down in a second without any setbacks, so you can just pause the game and flit down to your actual Steam window instead without any trouble.\n\nAlso, bare in mind that when it lables the release date as "11th April 2014" it means that that is when it was released on Steam, not when it was actually released for the first time. If you are after a game with modern standard graphics (y'know, when people have faces and whatnot) then don't hold your breath. But, depite the lack of overly extensive dtail on the units the scenery is alright, it doesn't look like the view from out of your window but it is good enough, exceptionally so for its era. The reason you play this game is not because of the immense graphics that require more processing power than the Matrix to run. You play it because it is immersive, fun and features some very good strategic elements, which I did just add a list of to the review but I got carried away and it was way too long, so I'll jut stick by saying that there are lots of them and I'll let you figure them out for yourselves or let other people tell you in other, better and more thorough reviews.","April 15, 2014","true","0.9"," 52 of 67 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","52","67","0","0"

So when my Dad brought this game home I found it hard not to fall in love as the game portrays what Romans are remembered for in many little and major aspects of the game.\n\nThis game will seem overwelming at first and the fact that it is old and pretty harsh graphics to look at won't help, especially if your new to the RTS genre. The personel management of troops is the main feature of this game as well as supplying new troops from villages that have either a barbarian or eastern theme. This works well but could be seriously expanded on. For example the only way to select troops is a drag box method. This is also fine but gets annoying when troops move indepedantly due to any stimuli. For example the troops will move out the way for a catapult and when I return to them they are somewhere else and have alerted the enemy. So some polish and rethink of coding and game aspects is needed.\n\nThis being said once you understand the game it can be very engaging and it is hard to press save because you want to finish your mission from the senate.\nThe cutsenes every 3-4 episodes are really cool and help you understand what is going on in your story (what little there is of it).\nYou can also play as the barbarians or egyptians/easternerns which is fun and different but all 3 factions have the same basic unit structure. Auxilary/light infanty who can build things, Archers , heavy infanty, spearmen, cavarly both ranged and none.\nThis being sai abilities of units do vary across the factions which makes the game slighlty more tasteful.\n\nWould i recomend this game?\nOnly if you enjoy or are familiar with both Romans and the entire theme of Rome, and RTS games - kinda obvious\n\nKind regards to all who read this through.\n","April 15, 2014","true","4.5"," 36 of 43 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","36","43","0","0"

Some users are facing some crashes, but a final solution is already available on this guide: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=249923472\nNo other RTS game can provide the emotion that Praetorians provides. When playing this game online in a room with 8 players, for example, a 4v4 clan game battle with voice communication, you cannot even blink, such is the emotion and attention required. This is really a great game! One of the best!\n\nThe best part of the game: it is not enough to know what to do and how to do, you need to have a good control of the game and keep your emotions firm, so that you can move your troops correctly and kill the enemy properly! Also, sometimes you have no more than few miliseconds to take an important decision that may lead you to the glory or to the destruction!\n\nMany people are playing this game only versus CPU. However, when you start to play Praetorians online in multiplayer mode, the game seems to be a totally new game! The way of playing, the way of thinking, even the way of moving your troops, everything is totally different! You cannot lose one single movement, you cannot miss what your enemies are thinking and planning, otherwise you may be caught in a trap and all your armies are going to be destroyed.\n\nFor those who has not experienced yet the emotion of playing Praetorians online in Multiplayer mode, I invite you to read this guide and join the multiplayer Praetorians community in Game Ranger, allthe best players are there!

So instead of "oh no, those thirty guys look really tough" you get "oh no, those ten squads are terrifying."\n\nThe other thing making it different is the lack of resources. You only have one resource: population. To be trained, the village you are trying to train them from needs to have enough citizens in it to become your new unit. They repopulate overtime. So capturing villages is essential so you can have more guys, but there are times where you may instead want to burn down an enemy village to completely remove it from the game as opposed to capturing it.\n\nThe main problem, and we are still playing to figure this out, but the Romans appear to just suck. The Barbarian equivalents of their units are just that much better. We haven't tried Egyptians, maybe the Barbarian vs Egyptian match up is balanced, but as it stands the Romans are most likely bottom tier. They are the only three races, and all of them have the same equivalent units, except for their three super units which you can only train if you've gotten enough "honour points" - which you get by killing dudes.\n\nGetting multiplayer to work required us to go through Gameranger instead (hence the low playtime), but we did get it to work and it is very worth it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kryskiller666/recommended/277460/","kryskiller666","BadassFreeman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kryskiller666/","217 products in account","This game, is balls. In a good way.\n\nI had this game since it came out, about 2003 or 2004, and if it wasn't because the CD ended up useless after using it too much, I would probably still play the original version, and have not bought this one. But dude, at THIS price, how to say "no"? Less than 1€ for this? But you probably don't know crap about it, do you? I won't judge for that, actually!\n\nPraetorians is an Spanish strategy game, from the old, old times. Because it was made ONLY in Spanish, the English version was kind of rushed, that being one of the biggest problems of the game: Holy ♥♥♥♥, the English voices suck so hard, I rather call GG and ragequit from life. If you're Spanish, you can just install a patch to put the good Spanish voices, but if you're not...Learn Spanish, or get ear-♥♥♥♥♥, I guess. The other main issue with this game, is the fact that was build to work on Windows XP, back when it was mainstream. That means you will have some problems, unless you check in the game files, and set the .exe file of the game to run as it was on Windows XP. Not a big deal, but unless you do it, your game will look corrupted as ♥♥♥♥, with black textures, and stuff like that. The last bad thing about this game, is that the original servers are loooooooong gone. Fear not, though. Lan still works just fine, and there are ways to play online, one of them, and probably the best one, being GameRanger...Or whatever that thing is called, haven't tested it yet, but I will (if I find anything wrong with it, I will edit this part of the Review). Now that the bad stuff of the game, I can just go along and tell you about the rest.\n\nBut hey, is the actual game any good? Holy ♥♥♥♥, it is. Have you played other strategy games? Warcraft III? Age of Empires? Starcraft? In most strategy games, you spend an awful lot of time getting resources: Wood, gold, food, all kinds of stuff, right? WELL F#CK THAT, WE ARE GOING REALISTIC HERE. Praetorians was one of those games that decided to f#ck da police, and do something diferent, and on this case, it works quite well!\n\nThere's only two resources here: First, people. How do you get people? Capture a town. You DON'T build the towns, they already exist out there. Find one, force them to work with you by building some pointless-looking tower, and send your Captain on it. If the town has, for example, 300 recluits, you will be able to build 300 soldiers. Most troops go in sets of 12, 16 or 30, though. And what's the other resource? Honor. You get honor by killing enemy units, doesn't matter if they're scouts, simple soldiers, or their captains. With honor, you can build stronger units, like cavalry.\n\nThere are 3 races: Romans (Hey cousin, let's go bolling!), Barbarians, and Egypcians. It's not too much, I know, but just like the 4 races of Warcraft 3, they all feel different: Romans mainly use their formations, and rely on the player to think before doing anything stupid, using the terrain to it's favor. Barbarians have less troops, but can work together, setting up powerful traps (for example, their main warriors can immobilize an enemy troop long enough for you to aim your siege units, and annihilate them), and the Egypcians...Well, they're not used much, mainly because their troops are weaker, but faster to build. It turns into a Zerg-rush quite quick. That doesn't mean they're not good to play as, just not as fun. Their Special units (remember, you build them with honor) are quite powerful, though.\n\nWhen it comes to how to navigate the map, and how gameplay works into it, it feels like Warcraft III, but more tactical:\n\nTroops that are not spear-mans and cavalry can go into forests. Inside them, they're invisible for the enemies outside.\n\nThe tall-grass works in a similar way, but spear-mans are allowed to go in. The bad part of it, is that archers can set the tall-grass on fire, making it hard to go across, and pretty much instantly killing any soldiers hidden on it.\n\nOnly your main soldiers (like the Roman legionnaires), and I think Siege units as well, won't be able to cross rivers.\n\nTroops that are in high-grounds will get vision of anything bellow, and will get extra-range of they're ranged units. Units bellow won't see from where the attacks are comming, and won't see the enemies as well.\n\nYou get the idea. It doesn't matter that you build yourself a huge army with 500 soldiers, you go in without exploring first, and you're probably getting your ♥♥♥ whopped. Because that's another thing, exploration units! There are two, ground and sky exploration:\n\nWith the ground scout, you can check forests and tall-grass. And incase you think the enemy might be near, you can send your wolf instead. Don't worry, the wolf won't get killed, but they can chase it and find the scout!\n\nThe sky scout works like the ground one while you don't use his companion, an eagle. You can send it to any nearby places, and see from the sky what's up there. It scouts way quicker than the ground one, but won't get any vision on woods, and any  enemy range unit will scare it off with an attack.\n\nYou get the main idea, this game is Warcraft III, set in the Ancient Rome, and serious as hell. If you're a filthy casual, you can indeed have fun with the single player and the bots, though. The story mode is actually quite long, with like 30 or more chapters, all of them with voices and it's own story, all of it, based on real battles. The bots play well, and come in 3 different settings of difficulty, and the maps are quite good as well. And incase you get bored of the game, or want more stuff, there's one mod called "Imperial Mod 5.0", or something like that, that adds a bunch more races, a ♥♥♥♥-load of maps, more music, and better textures. Of course, the game looks dated at these times...But I don't mind, it was pretty before, and it's kind of pretty today, still.\n\nIf you love real-time strategy games, and don't like to set up bases to farm like a prick for half the match, you should look into this game. Specially with the price drops. Right now, as I write this, it's at less than 1€, and I can tell you, for that price YOU SHOULD TOTALLY BUY IT. At full price it's something like 4-5€, and even though it's still a good price, you might want to wait for a better deal. Just let yourself go, and enjoy old games that where actually good, without ripping off all your money.","July 11, 2014","true","3.7"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","13","18","2","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kikokyle/recommended/277460/","kikokyle","kekekaka","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kikokyle/","172 products in account","Growing up with this game, and playing it the most and extremely enjoying it, this is my favorite RTS of all time, and up there in my favorite games. It's pure fun. Now it's on Steam.\n\nIt's a little hard to get it going and working on Steam but just check out the Community Guides and install the Mod Complex. It isn't very hard once you pay attention to the directions and the games works perfectly plus some extras from mods of this game from the past. The only thing I couldn't get working was the in-game Steam overlay but I won't miss it that much.\n\nThe game doesn't require resources to collect or anything, just population and a troop max, which adds to the strategy because you have to predict what the enemy will show up with and use the troop max wisely to match their units and beat them. From my long, long, long experience with this game it relies on a big battle between two factions, and whoever comes out the winner with what troops they picked and how they used them, pretty much is able at that point to defeat that player... putting them in deep trouble. However, when you play with multiple CPUs, the AI will be smart enough to try and finish your army off if you lose too many troops and then you'll be the one in big trouble.\n\nThat's why I love this game: it's timing, your decisions, and pure military that control the battles.\n\nThe maps are pretty great. A lot of them are set up in linear terrain settings... which sounds awful, but Pyro designed these maps so well so that it isn't so straight foward. There's always another way to go, a different way to fight in *most* maps.\n\nGraphics? This game is from 2003... you get what you expect. However, I say you get a bit more. Some people will probably disagree with me, but the game looks fantastic still! I think that this game has aged extremely well. Obviously textures have aged, but graphically, the heart of how this game looks and not the technical stuff, it's well crafted and meant to last.\n\nNot many people play multiplayer any more, and even the Steam release hasn't breathed that much light into it. Through the game you can only use LAN/IP connections, but most people use GameRanger anyways. Not quite as active as say Rome: Total War, but there are some people.\n\nThere are a few decent mods for this game too, the best of which are included in the aforementioned Mod Complex.\n\nThe soundtrack is pretty fantastic and I wish the composer Mateo Pascual did more soundtracks. He's worked with Pyro Studios a few times, and done a few other things too, but this is certainly his pinacle. Seriously, I like this soundtrack so much I put it on my phone's music app (Google Play whatever you don't care haha). If you're looking for epic but intricate and catchy classical music with drums and symphonies, this is the bee's knee's.\n\nThis game isn't perfect though. Sometimes it's a bit reliant on "more men + better units = winner" type of strategy. It does take some time to figure out, but once you realize that this isn't how the game works, and you realize that nearly every time you fight someone you can beat them without following this strategy (or letting it happen to you), then this problem disappears. A lot of people feel that the troop max is annoying, but I feel that without it being at the limit it is, this game wouldn't be very difficult. Sure, I've said the AI is pretty good, and there are three different difficulties with a mostly decent difficulty curve, but the limit is surely essential, I feel. Gameplay wise, the vanilla game doesn't have an incredible amount to offer, but it's also $5 and like I said, it's very easy to install Mod Complex to get more gameplay-adding mods. The game can't nearly go to 1920x1080 resolution and has a lot more technical limitations than any modern game, but remember it's from 2003. Overall, once you get working, it's awesome. Buy it.\n\n9.5/10","April 19, 2014","true","5.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Then, in an actual mission you will STILL get a black screen after the cinematic. Alt+tabbing and restoring the window will bring the image back up. Then, in-game the map/unit info overlay glitches 80-90% of the time when a unit is selected, making framerate crawl and locking up the mouse, killing the game. I was able to play through one of the tutorial missions without problems after working at fixing this for 2-3 hours, and even then when I tried to start a regular campaign mission the overlay glitch prevented me from doing anything at all.\n\nAlso, in terms of gameplay, you're limited to a relatively tight camera zoom, making things feel claustrophobic and making situational awareness sort of difficult.\n\nTL;DR don't buy this unless you're prepared to do some serious troubleshooting just to get the game to a place where it's playable.","October 19, 2015","false","0.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

The game does not work, Apparently because the steam version is not optimized for newer PC's, and it didn't even say in wasn't optimized, according to my research. If it is true, DO NOT GET THIS GAME. Maybe, If they patch it, I will recommend it,If it is to my liking. It probably will, Since I study the Ancient World, so it will interesting. If you Like Rome: Total War, and you have the PC needed,(It might be hard to find if you have the right PC considering that it doesn't tell you easily) I recommend it.But if you like R:TW but doesn't have the right PC, like Me, I would recommend that you wait for a patch. But from the looks of it, It looks like a mix Between R:TW, Stronghold 2 and Age of Empires, 2 which i like. (If You are a strategy fan, I think you know which is the bad one.) If you are looking for an Ancient Rome strategy game, get Rome:Total War instead. If you are looking for fast-paced RTS, get Age Of Empires 2. But if you have the right PC and not much money, this game would PROBABLY be a good choice.  I hope this was helpful to you. -PixelationNation\n\nPS: If it IS optimized for newer PC's, Remember that this info' was found on the Internet, and you know you can never trust the Internet.\n\nEDIT: As it turns out, you CAN get this working for PC's like mine, You just Run it through the .EXE file. But still, No-one should have to do that. As for the ACTUAL GAME, it is ok. It's no Rome: Total War, But it's not as bad as Stronghold 2. I see reviews saying that this is very nostalgic for them, and I can understand and respect that, Because back then there wasn't a whole lot games like this. I would probably LOVE this game, if I haven't played R:TW before, But since I did,and i think R:TW is the best game ever, I think this game is OK. but since it's very cheap, I would recommend getting this game, if you like Ancient Rome games and for some odd reason You can't Get R:TW. The best reason I can think is that you already have it. But saying that, Praetorians isn't THAT historically Accurate, sure it does have some True History, But some things are Quite Silly.

I didn't expect it to be as grand and visually impressive as the Rome: Total War series, but it has it's own unique style and the smaller scale of units allows for a quicker pace and more action. The strategy gets progressively more advanced and is way more in-depth than what you see at first glance. The tutorials are rather boring but they provide some nice tips that will help you out later in the missions once the difficulty increases. For a game made in 2003 the presentation is quite good, and anyone who appreciates Roman History and the fall of the Republic will be satisfied with the story.

When I saw it in good discount, I had to grab it. And it was worth it, although mixed reviews and advertised Technical problems scared me a bit, game runs fine on mine Win7 HP and even on Win 10. The game itself is quite hard and unforgiving but still very entertaining when you do good moves. It mainly focuses on tactics, strategy and placement of units and there is still good variety of missions. I also like although you can't build your base etc. like in other RTS, but you can still build various siege weapons, guard towers and recruit new units in villages.  I also recommend getting great adittion Mod Complex, it adds new breath to this great old game.","July 29, 2015","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I didn't expect it to be as grand and visually impressive as the Rome: Total War series, but it has it's own unique style and the smaller scale of units allows for a quicker pace and more action. The strategy gets progressively more advanced and is way more in-depth than what you see at first glance. The tutorials are rather boring but they provide some nice tips that will help you out later in the missions once the difficulty increases. For a game made in 2003 the presentation is quite good, and anyone who appreciates Roman History and the fall of the Republic will be satisfied with the story. Overall a great game and for less than a dollar it is worth a spot in anyone's library.

But while it's nice to be able to feel like you're looking at a real person, graphics aren't everything (please don't hurt me). Praetorians is only 59p, maybe less now! See there are advantages to old games! It's a tactical strategy sort of game (and 50% close the page and look at "C.O.D. : Black Ops 3" ) But it's not boring and very enjoyable, it's a good challenge but not too hard. But don't be fooled, I don't think the multiplayer works me and my friend tried it, but if you get it to work message me please. All in all a very good game I recommend it,\nDoge master out,\nDoges for life,\nPeace...","December 21, 2015","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
