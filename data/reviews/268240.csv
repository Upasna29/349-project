It is a reaction and path-learning based platformer with rouge-like elements (no checkpoints in levels).  Once you beat a level, though, you can move on.\n\nI usually can’t stand rouge-likes, because having to start over from the beginning after playing for an hour+ doesn’t appeal to me.  Fortunately the levels in Mechanic Escape are each only about a minute long, so even when you mess up: it isn’t that bad.  It does a pretty good job of being difficult without being overbearing.  Masochistic gamers out there may disagree and may find this game too easy, but I felt this game was just the right amount of challenging.  It toes the line of challenging and downright frustrating, while staying on the better side.\n\nThere will be frustrating moments though.  About 80% of the times you die it will be because you made a mistake—usually due to the fact you are still learning the proper path through a level.  10% of the times you die it will just be due to the luck of the draw, as there are instances where an enemy attack will be unavoidable due to randomness. And the final 10% are the truly frustrating deaths: those where your character does something you didn’t want due to the minimalistic control scheme.  The most annoying example of this is that jumping next to a wall will cause you to wall-jump backwards always, even if you don’t want to.  Some games require you to push the directional button towards the wall to execute a wall jump, and if you don’t then you will just jump normally… which gives you more control.  In Mechanic Escape, there is no way to jump next to a wall without wall jumping—it doesn’t matter which way you aim the direction.  There are other examples as well, but that one was the most egregious for me.\n\nThere are 4 worlds with 20 levels each.  The first 2 worlds are pretty easy.  Towards the end of world 3 and throughout world 4 the levels begin to get quite challenging and will probably require a few dozen tries to get it right.  But even the hardest levels can be beaten before it gets to the point of tossing the controller out the window.\n\nThe graphics are on par with what you would expect from a modern indie platformer.  The music is decent, but pretty unvaried.  And there is no story really, just a theme.\n\nIn summary, I would say if you are interested in getting a taste of rouge-lite, challenging platformer action, but don’t want a game that’s so over-the-top it will have you pull your hair out: then check out Mechanic Escape.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","April 27, 2015","true","7.5"," 36 of 43 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","36","43","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/amazingspiderpunk/recommended/268240/","amazingspiderpunk","P!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/amazingspiderpunk/","1460 products in account","Now before you think I dislike the game, I don't...I just can't recommend it fully for a few reasons which I'll outline in this review. Overall, I'd probably give the game an 8/10 for the first half only, but a 5/10 overall.\n\nMechanic Escape is a fun little Super Meat Boy-esque platformer in the sense that it is very trial and error. For the most part, when you die it is entirely your fault as the player. It takes skill and dexterity to get through the levels. Again, for the most part.\n\nThe story is pretty lax. There's a tiny movie at the beginning and the end. Basically, you're a TV and your TV buddies are captured. You collect them and free them from captivity. That's it. Where it shines, though, is the style. The artwork for it is beautiful and I really enjoyed the general look of the entire game. Some areas seemed to pop more than others and being stuck in certain worlds made me grow tired of their appearance, but for the most part it was a lovely looking game.\n\nGameplay is where the game both shines and falls flat. Chapters 1, 2, and the first half of 3 were great. The controls felt tight and responsive, though there were some minor pitfalls. The second half of Chapter 3, however, introduced a lot of segments where you have to float upward while avoiding walls, spikes, etc. The problem with this is you are floaty. Too floaty. Nudge right or left fly halfway across the screen floaty. The worst offender is the finale of chapter 3 which may be the hardest level in the game by far. There were 2 or 3 of these air sections in total and they really got on my nerves by the 40th death or so. Note that before this level, the most deaths I've ever gotten in one level was 21 and I would not move to another until I 100% completed it by collecting all the TVs.\n\nLevel design was hit or miss. Some levels were awesome and harkened back to platformers of yore. My favourite addition was put into the third chapter and was well welcomed by myself and I'm sure anyone who played Donkey Kong Country...barrel cannons! These were utilized well and one level in particular used them nearly exclusively. That level may have been my favourite in the entire game. Where the level design fails, though, is when it relies too much on making you wait or keeping you moving. Almost every level has a boss enemy that chases you. These enemies are unkillable and never stop, so you must keep moving, too. Add onto the completely broken mechanic of there being laser gates that open and close at set intervals and pillars that can smash you and occasionally you're thrown into many unwinnable situations. Sometimes beating a level is more luck based than skill based since the timing isn't always 100% the same each time you reload.\n\nI also noticed frustrations in controlling your character that didn't matter much in earlier levels but did a TON in later ones: walljumping is performed by being close to a wall and pressing the jump button. Your hitbox is large. A lot of times you will walljump without meaning to and cause your own inadvertent death. Second, any button at all triggers the Kong barrels. If you are running into one and do not let go of the direction button in time, you will be shot out in an instant. This has caused me some unneeded strife in later levels.\n\nThere's also a few glitches in the game, too. One that can be both good and bad depending on how its used is some objects do not obey pausing the game. For example, there are turrets that shoot insta-kill fireballs. If you pause the game, the fireballs still travel forward. So too do the smashing pillars raise and lower and the laser gates open and close. This is a horrible design choice if you expect the player to have to pause for any reason. I had to go take a bathroom break halfway through a level in Chapter 4 only to unpause the game and die before I even see what happened. After experimentation, I find out the glitch I mentioned above. Honestly, it wouldn't have hurt to know earlier both to avoid deaths like that and to maybe even the playing field when it comes to those levels where you both have to constantly move but paradoxically wait for a path to open up.\n\nFinally, let's talk about achievements. The ones in this game are really easy to get and if you beat the entire game, you WILL get all of them with the possible exception of the 1000 deaths one. (I had to spam kill myself after beating the game to pick it up). This is all well and good, but there is NO reward for beating the game. Even worse is that the collect x amount of TVs achievements will be maxed out by 100%ing chapter 3, making chapter 4 almost pointless to play unless you really enjoy the game. And by that point, you won't. If you do druge on like I did and 100% the entire game, collecting all TVs and conquer all 80 stages, you are greeted with a short cutscene saying "The End, Thanks For Playing". This is the very same scene you get for just beating the levels without collecting all TVs. In other words, there is no incentive to actually 100% the game. You'll have all the collection achievements by the end of chapter 3 and all the unlockable costumes by the middle of chapter 2.\n\nIn conclusion, for completionists this is a terrible game. The glitches and the control gripes make 100% clearing it a chore and you are given nothing in return if you do. For the casual platformer fan, though, this could be a nice diversion or alternative to other games out there. For the price, I do feel it's mostly worth it, but I can't really recommend it as the flaws outweigh what's great. I liked the game, but after about 75% of it I began to tire of it and only continued on to see what it had to offer. I made it that far, might as well complete it. But I was only met with disappointment and a longing for something a little more polished.","August 25, 2014","false","7.1"," 26 of 32 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","26","32","0","3"

Mechanic Escape is fast-paced and fun. You control a little TV-lookig fellow who has to jump, fall, swing from "vines", shoot itself from cannons, and float on air curents, all while dodging tons of environmental hazads and giant robot nemeses my sons and I dubbed Factors. At the same time, you're trying to pick up as many of your little TV friends per level as possible. There are fifty small and five large TVs to collect in each level.\n\nAlmost every level requires a bit of trial and error, and memorization of all the little ins and outs and change-ups of the layout. Luckily, it rarely gets too frustrating because the levels are so short, with each taking around a minute to complete. So even if you die, you're usually only seconds away from getting back to where you were. The game starts out fairly easy, but the difficulty increases steadily.  A nice feature is that normally if a level is too punishing (and there are some that have taken me dozens of tries) you can skip trying to collect all the TVs and just take the straight route through to make it easier on yourself.\n\nOn top of that, the game has a delightful art style, with crispy, bright graphics. This is a great game to take in short bursts of maybe 30 minutes or so at a time, because there's really no story, and you can just pop in and complete a few levels then shelf it for a few days before coming back.  Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys a challenging platforming.","November 10, 2014","true","15.3"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/recommended/268240/","cyrilpanda","Cyril","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/","596 products in account","So fundamentally mediocre that it can't possibly be recommended.\n1. Bland level design. All 90 degree angles so there's a limited scale of what's possible and the 80 levels tend to not have anything unique about them. As well, most of the added mechanics don't add much to the game. The cannons have about two levels where they do anything, and the circuits literally add nothing.\n2. Bad level design. A lot of the levels are seemingly designed to let you keep moving without stopping, but then a fair number of them actually tend to have collectibles placed in a way that isn't quite natural, forcing a lot of awkward jumps that makes things far harder than necessary; levels where I died the most tended to have this exact problem.\n3. Unfair gameplay elements. Two of the three "boss" monsters have attacks that are often luck-based whether or not you can work around them. The missiles can kill you through no fault of your own in narrow corridors or forced jumping sections, and lasers and tight corridors just never mix. The bosses often seem shoehorned into the levels simply because every level is obligated to have one, and the levels aren't designed with them in mind; especially the case with timed elements that can often force you to wait /during/ chase sections. Eugh.\n4. Bad controls. The character is the lightest, floatiest platformer character I've ever seen. Jumps are from HOLDING the jump button, not pressing it, so you often end up wall-jumping off places you didn't mean to. Cannons fire when ANY button is pressed, not just the jump button, leading to many cheap deaths. Poles only let you jump in the direction you're facing, which is not always the direction you're pressing for some odd reason; especially painful in that one level where you have to jump between two poles with a boss chasing you.\n\nThere's just not much to like here, it's so bland and incompetently designed; the only challenge comes from how poorly some sequences are set up.\n\nAlso, a nitpick, but the achievements are kind of dumb as heck too. You can 100% this game without playing past the third world. On the opposite side, dying enough times for the last achievement takes serious effort.","August 13, 2014","false","8.1"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","11","17","0","1"

It's very linear and rhythmical, where timing is more important than actual mechanical mastery. Think more Rayman, less Super Meat Boy (the iOS Rayman, anyway, never played the others).\n\nEvery obstacle is designed to be easily surpassed if you time everything right, making it easier the faster you go. There are collectibles in each level, but they generally serve as a guide/help, instead of a hinderance. There are 50 little guys spread around, almost delineating the optimal path. Then, there are 5 bigger ones that are usually in alternate paths, but are just as fast as the normal paths, only you need to pay attention to where they may appear.\n\nThere are 80 levels, spread out on 4 worlds. Every level is beaten in about 40 seconds and there are no checkpoints in each level, you have to beat it all in one go.\n\nYou can only jump and run, basically. The running could have even been scrapped (again, iOS Rayman) and the little guy run automatically, since you can't really stop, most of the time.\nHowever, there are lots of different obstacles, slowly introduced as you progress. They're introduced elegantly, usually in a harmless manner, as a warning.\n\nThere's also a Boss of sorts in every level. In certain sections, that Boss pursues you, sometimes even shoots bullets/lasers at you. This is a very limiting obstacle, making it almost impossible to stop and think before starting another challenge. It is good, sometimes, keeping you on your toes! It's a pressure point of the level.\n\nLater on, however, it can be frustrating and very, very limiting, to the point that you'll die dozens of times before pulling everything off perfectly.\n\n\nThe first 3 worlds are really enjoyable! Everything is well timed and fun to go through. The last world is a huge spike in difficulty... I was halfway through the 4th world with less than 600 deaths. The last 10 level cost me 300 lives. That's a bit disproportional, isn't it? ... Well, everything is timed just slightly off. I'm not sure it's intentional. But it makes the game a lot harder. Like... a lot. Instead of running through it elegantly, as before, you have to find ways of tricking the Boss, and even slow yourself, but not too much, otherwise it'll catch you...\nI was really frustrating. Usually, I had 3-7 deaths, sometimes around 20 deaths on hard levels. On the 4th chapter, some levels were around 30 deaths, one of them even reaching 80, and another 60. Granted, there were some easy levels as well, but the frustrating ones painted the picture, for me.\n\n\nThe biggest "problem" is how floaty the controls are. This is intentional. And it works mostly well, for the first 60-70 levels. Because the levels are well designed around these controls. For the reasons stated before, it becomes really frustrating, since the floatiness doesn't allow for fine-tuned movement.\n\n\nAlso, the achievements do not reward perfecting the levels (all collectibles) at all, and there doesn't seem to be Time leaderboards nor achievements... I think it would only benefit a game like this, but oh well.\n\n\nAll in all, it's still a solid game. I enjoyed most of my time with it. It looks good, the music is pretty cool, and it can provide a challenge. Give it a go! Oh, and it's nowhere near as difficult as Super Meat Boy. I mean, not even close. So don't worry about that. It can still appeal to more "casual" platformer fans.","July 5, 2015","true","7.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's a very simple platformer with basic controls, you move around and jump. At first the controls felt a bit "floaty" but it only took a couple of minutes to get used to and after a few levels it felt really solid. You speedrun through the levels and collect tvs, it's a great and simple concept.\n\nThe levels are really well made and even if I missed some collectibles along the way it didn't really bother me. Since the game is so fast paced I didn't mind retrying a level a couple of times until I could collect everything.\n\nThe downside to this game is that it feels abandoned in a way. It times your run on each level but there's no use for it really. The lack of leaderboard is a dissapointment because it has the potential to offer some real good competition and replay value. The other thing are the achievements, they are just one big grind. I'm not surprised that the most rare achievement is "Die 1000 times" because you probably won't play the game again after you finish it. There's no reason to keep collecting all the tvs either after the third chapter because at that point you already got the achievement for the collectibles. But then again, not everyone is obsessed with achievements (Don't judge me!).\n\nSo if you enjoy platformers, you like to go fast and you're not too obsessed with the lack of achievements and leaderboards there's a good chance you will enjoy this game!","March 26, 2015","true","5.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"

There are collectibles in each level, but they generally serve as a guide/help, instead of a hinderance. There are 50 little guys spread around, almost delineating the optimal path. Then, there are 5 bigger ones that are usually in alternate paths, but are just as fast as the normal paths, only you need to pay attention to where they may appear.\n\nThere are 80 levels, spread out on 4 worlds. Every level is beaten in about 40 seconds and there are no checkpoints in each level, you have to beat it all in one go.\n\nYou can only jump and run, basically. The running could have even been scrapped (again, iOS Rayman) and the little guy run automatically, since you can't really stop, most of the time.\nHowever, there are lots of different obstacles, slowly introduced as you progress. They're introduced elegantly, usually in a harmless manner, as a warning.\n\nThere's also a Boss of sorts in every level. In certain sections, that Boss pursues you, sometimes even shoots bullets/lasers at you. This is a very limiting obstacle, making it almost impossible to stop and think before starting another challenge. It is good, sometimes, keeping you on your toes! It's a pressure point of the level.\n\nLater on, however, it can be frustrating and very, very limiting, to the point that you'll die dozens of times before pulling everything off perfectly.\n\n\nThe first 3 worlds are really enjoyable! Everything is well timed and fun to go through. The last world is a huge spike in difficulty... I was halfway through the 4th world with less than 600 deaths. The last 10 level cost me 300 lives. That's a bit disproportional, isn't it? ... Well, everything is timed just slightly off. I'm not sure it's intentional. But it makes the game a lot harder. Like... a lot. Instead of running through it elegantly, as before, you have to find ways of tricking the Boss, and even slow yourself, but not too much, otherwise it'll catch you...\nI was really frustrating. Usually, I had 3-7 deaths, sometimes around 20 deaths on hard levels. On the 4th chapter, some levels were around 30 deaths, one of them even reaching 80, and another 60. Granted, there were some easy levels as well, but the frustrating ones painted the picture, for me.\n\n\nThe biggest "problem" is how floaty the controls are. This is intentional. And it works mostly well, for the first 60-70 levels. Because the levels are well designed around these controls. For the reasons stated before, it becomes really frustrating, since the floatiness doesn't allow for fine-tuned movement.\n\n\nAlso, the achievements do not reward perfecting the levels (all collectibles) at all, and there doesn't seem to be Time leaderboards nor achievements... I think it would only benefit a game like this, but oh well.\n\n\nAll in all, it's still a solid game. I enjoyed most of my time with it. It looks good, the music is pretty cool, and it can provide a challenge. Give it a go! Oh, and it's nowhere near as difficult as Super Meat Boy. I mean, not even close. So don't worry about that. It can still appeal to more "casual" platformer fans.","July 5, 2015","true","7.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Of course, the real challenge is collecting each and every one of the smaller tvs before finishing the level.\n\nPlayed  with a controller, I did find it difficult initially to get my head around the momentum of the players character. The gravity seems less present than in other games, but once you figure it out and get used to it the game plays pretty well. It can be frustrating at times when the character drifts in certain directions, but this game is meant to be played fast rather than slowly (this effect is less noticeable at high speeds). This is when played with an xbox 360 controller, which works great.\n\nThe graphics in this game are very nice, with differing styles in each world, and nice details on the player character and the enemies that follow you around. The music is nice initially, but I began to tire of it fairly quickly, as it plays on a constant loop.\n\nAside from the intially odd momentum and gravity the player has, I had no major bugs. worth noting however: If the flying enemy that shoots bullets is within a wall, it can fire bullets that pass through the wall without exploding. Watch out for that.\n\nThis is a veyr nice game, and definitely worth buying if you like platformers that play at high speeds.","April 1, 2015","true","8.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Starts off very easy, but gets progressively harder though never to SMB levels - which is a good thing because the levels are longer so dying would cost you more time (nope, no mid-level checkpoints here either.)\n\nUnlike SMB, most levels feature at least one or two "chase" scenes, so it's not only the traps that you need to worry about.  Also, no spikes! (don't worry, plenty of other things can kill you.)\n\nThe controls are good when on the ground or "wall jumping", but very "floaty" when in the air.  I don't know if this was intentional to increase the challenge, but it makes it very hard to air-maneuver with a gamepad's analog stick - the input is digital, making it too easy to "oversteer" or understeer by holding the direction for too long or too short a time.  In a few sections, I found it easier to switch from my 360 pad to a keyboard so I could quickly tap the direction buttons without worrying about deadzones.  But you can doublejump from the beginning, which is a plus - double jumping should be mandatory for all platformers IMO :)\n\nThere are 4 chapters of 20 levels each.  I beat them all, but only "100%d" the first chapter since I decided doing so for the latter ones would be too frustrating.\n\nIn the end, this game isn't anything really special, but it's a decent piece of twitch platforming fun if you can get used to the air controls.  I'd recommend it on a 50% Off or better sale.","August 9, 2014","true","5.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Needless to say Mechanic Escape is a gorgeous fast-paced and fun platformer where you play as a TV and collect TV's... what more could you want? However, I did enjoy it like everything it still had it's pro's and cons which I will explain.\n\nPro's:\n♦ Awesome Graphics and level designs (Similar to Rayman)\n♦ Challenging like all good Platformers should be (Not too challenging that it takes away the fun)\n♦ Easy but good Achievements (Mainly for just playing the game)\n♦ Aspects such as Time and Starring for 100% completion to make you want to replay levels (This is great as it keeps the levels interesting and gives you something to do once you have finished the levels)\n♦ Steam Trading Cards\n♦ Controls that just seem to work (Pressing the up arrow allows you to jump, what more could you want?)\n♦ Great number of levels (Not too many and not too little)\n♦ Constantly adding new things to levels the further you get in the game (This made the game more interesting as you didn't know what to expect per level)\n♦ Every level was different and had some uniqueness to it (No one level felt like the last etc)\n♦ Unlockable Character Skins (This keeps your TV looking sexy, what more could you want than a sexy looking TV?)\n\nCon's\n♦ Lacking Storyline (There was little to no storyline which kind of ruined the game. Needless to say when you beat a Chapter and went to the next there could have been a cinematic which lead up to the final cinematic but there wasn't)\n♦ Final Cinematic didn't make much sense (This was disappointing as I expected something more)\n♦ Last levels of each Chapter were the same as any other level (There was nothing to distinguish that you were playing the last level of a Chapter or the first, which was annoying as they could have added in bosses or something unique just to symbolize it was the last level of the Chapter)\n♦ Jumping sometimes seemed weird (Jumping from ropes seemed like you had a delay and when in the air sometimes if you pressed left or right you'd go flying which was annoying)\n♦ No highscores (This would have made the game as each level had number of deaths and time. The game could have had level highscores based on fastest time and number of deaths which would have increased the fun even more)\n♦ Level lengths varied (Some levels seemed way shorter than others for absolutely no reason at all)\n\nOverall, even though there could have been a better storyline, highscores and jumping could have been better in a few situations... there are still many many pro's that make the game worth checking out. So, if you love Platformers with aspects of Super Meat Boy, Bit.Trip Runner with Rayman style graphics than I'd definitely recommend you check this out. Plus it's only $5 and you'll get over 8 hours out of it, so I enjoyed it and highly recommend it!\n\nPS: You get to play as a TV collecting TV's... what could be more better than that?","May 9, 2015","true","8.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

It's a platformer, duh. It is moderately fast paced and has elements of Super Meatboy in it (namely that when you die, you gotta start the whole thing over again). I am currently through chapter one and the levels take about 30-60 secs if I get everything (20 levels per chapter it seems). There is not much room for speed runs I think, because there is a "lovely" feature in which you are very often hunted by an annoying robot thing that kills you on contact, catches up to you and even explodes periodically and is only lost when passing a gate. Your goal is to just complete the level, as a bonus there are small and big monitors in the levels. I don't know what the small ones give you, but the big ones unlock skins. I completed every level on perfect so far (albeit with some cursing and retrying) and almost got all the skins now, so after that point there is no sense in collecting them anymore (they make the levels harder of course) other than personal accomplishment.\n\nSounds like an ok game, doesn't it, so why the negative review? For starters it gets pretty boring and repetitive. New elements are gradually introduced, but they're not very catchy or game changing. You don't seem to get any abilities, you don't fight, you just weave through the levels and those levels are pretty bland, not to mention the soundtrack which is the same for each level within a chapter...\nMy second problem are the controls. The game feels clunky and unresponsive, sluggish even. Not the best formula when you have to run away from a big bad killer machine. It almost feels like you are floating, you can double jump and wall jump and often it works as you want, but too often it just feels off, hard to explain. For example when you swing on a chain you cannot jump off the chain if it is not at its apex somehow. Either that or the controls are not responding properly. Also holding down the jump button makes you jump continuously (I am the kind of person that wills a jump to go longer if you only hold down the jump button lol, so that cost me a few lives).\n\nI can't say too many bad things about this game though. If you desperately need some sort of platformer and it's on sale, go ahead. If not then there are A LOT of better alternatives. Generic levels, boring sound track, weird controls and a wonky hero with a hitbox the size of an elephant as well as meaningless collecting of stuff within the levels and a constant pressure by being hunted. That is "mechanic escape" in a nutshell for me.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/recommended/268240/","fandango89","Apparently Kid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/","599 products in account","Take it from someone who did it already, don't waste your time on this turd. Although the basic premise and some of the level design is good, there are too many flawed game mechanics and controls that ruin it. First off, trust the reviews, the control of the character is terrible. People say many games are floaty, but I've never noticed it until this game, which has the worst platforming physics I've ever seen. For a game that wants you to be precise, it punishes you by having a character that is impossible to control. If you try to move him in the air, he will barely move, and then if he does move he has way too much momentum and you cannot stop him. 2/3 the time you die is because there is terrible control of him, the most important part of a platformer. 2nd off, the wall jumping mechanic is terrible. It makes you automatically jump off walls, even if you're not pressing the other way. This means multiple times you are just close to a wall and you're trying to jump up over it it will make you jump off of it, which is of terrible design and makes no sense. There should need to be a directional hold as in platformers you are commonly touching walls.\n\nThere are then just basic gameplay mechanics that are stupid and only there to inflate game length. First off, they use this thing that chases are you, which is fine sometimes but every single level uses it and so basically every level is instead of being a platformer, is a free running game like a bit-trip runner. It is akin to being forced to do all these hard jumps with terrible control against a clock, putting a timer on each level, which is just stupid. Add that to the fact that the chasing creature has abilities, like a heat seaking rocket. This means that since you are forced to take jumps while running, you cannot avoid it because you are forced into the platforming and only moving forward. So many times I died because there was literally nothing i go could and based on where the rocket was and its trajectory I automatically was going to die, which is just stupid because it means it is based on timing and not skill. The only way to try and get around this is by continually doing the part until you have the perfect timing and pace for the rocket to be shot at a different part, which means you need to follow some tempo set up by the game creators that you have no way of knowing until you do trial and error.\n\nAdd all these problems together and every time you die, which is after 1 hit, you must start the entire level over again. Having to lose all progress and start again based on bad control or poor game design is the worst offense. A checkpoint half-way through the level would make sense. This is all obvious they do this so you just retry the game to inflate game length, also known as the "super-meat-boy effect". This effect is where poor game design and forced play to complete the level without any mistakes and in the same way the developers did, makes the game seem longer because you just keep retrying the same part. It is a sign of sloppy game development, compared to a game like dark souls where mistakes are your own fault. There are a lot of levels, and a few unlockable costumes. Also, the complete lack of story doesn't bother me as much as it did other people. It was the terrible imprecise controls, and poor core mechanics of the game, that ruined it. 5/10.","January 18, 2015","false","8.2"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","1","5","0","1"

The other complaint is unesserary mechanics, like having to press the jump button to activate the cannons that shoot you since this are just static, it would make more sense if they changed position or angle like in Donkey Kong Country, this just slows you down, I also found that this cannons sometimes shoot you atomatically and sometimes dont, I dont know how that works.\n\nThis are also some other complains I have with the game, but they are MAY be more of a nitpick of mine, but the music is really not enjoyable, suiting but not enjoyable since it sounds sometimes like a robot having a screech at times, the hazards arent too visible at times, and every level just seem to blend toghether with no real differentiation but the level design being different. Also the main character design is just bad imo, it just doesnt feel suiting as you can be very agile, and you are like a chubby TV with stumpy legs... also why the wand-y thing?\n\nThe Pros\n\nGood responsive controls and worth the money in content.\n\nMy conclusion:\n\nBad music.\nBad visual design.\nGood gameplay that could be better by changing what was mentioned before.\nIt seems like a short game.\nNone existing story besides what it says on the store page (nothing is explained).\n\nFinal Score: 6/10 Average\n\n(This review is incomplete as it goes as far as the 14th lvl of the first world)\nEven though I give it a negative recomendation it doesnt means the game doesnt have some redeemable value.","October 12, 2014","false","1.6"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","6","16","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/himmatsj/recommended/268240/","himmatsj","himmatsj","http://steamcommunity.com/id/himmatsj/","138 products in account","I must say I have been thoroughly surprised by Mechanic's Escape. I expected something to simply satisfy my precision platforming itch, not something that, to some extent, blows me away and is so much fun to play.\n\nSo far, I've played 30 levels out of 80, so I can't talk about the overall difficulty, but I expect it to get pretty hardcore in worlds 3 and 4. The first world (20 levels each world) was pretty easy, and seasoned platformers should be able to perfect it completely in under an hour. However, from the last level of the first world to the first of the second world, you can already see that there's a marked jump in terms of difficulty. It's also worth noting that there are NO checkpoints, so you restart each time you die from the beginning. The good thing though is that the levels are mostly around 45 seconds long each.\n\nThe jumping is a bit floaty, but that's the nature of the game. In the first world, this won't matter much, but in the second, as things heat up and the collectibles are less straightforward, you'll need to take awhile to completely grasp it. I wouldn't count this against the game...that's just the learning curve here.\n\nOne thing I love about Mechanic's Escape is that (so far at least) the collectibles are "get-able". Some games tend to over-complicate the placement of the collectibles, but here, you can see most of them (none are really hidden) and it's usually just a matter of timing your jumps well or trying alternative ways to navigate the section to get them.\n\nArt looks great. The cartoonish visuals and theme is simple and not out-of-the-world, but nice to look at all the same. Sound design is serviceable for me. Nothing particularly memorable, nor anything bad.\n\nThe mechanics here are just moving left/right, and then jumping (double-tap to double jump). So yeah, pretty straight-forward. But the game adds new gameplay elements from time to time, such as rails, canons, air vents and electro-circuits, alongside new obstacles and enemies.\n\nOne novel addition to other platformers of its kind is that each level here usually has one or two boss sequences. The boss starts chasing you, so you have to navigate said sections quickly until a laser zaps said boss. It doesn't feel gimmicky at all to me and actually adds a sense of urgency (and a bit more challenge) to the game.\n\nOverall, I am plenty pleased with this. It surpassed my meager expectations, for sure. It has that addictive "one more try" going for it. The nature of the game means that this is obviously tailored to the hardcore gamer that can withstand bouts of deaths trying to get that one elusive collectible, or making that one particular jump. Or well, to those who just love shouting profanities at their deaf monitors every 30 seconds!\n\nUPDATE: I have played more now (50 levels already out of 80), and I can say with certainty that this is not as challenging as Super Meat Boy, Giana Sisters TD or Electronic Super Joy. This is good for me actually since I found the aforementioned games a tad too frustrating.\n\nIt is still a challenging precision platformer, just not as hardcore as the ones I mentioned above (which makes this an ideal game to start with if you've never played precision platformers). This could both be a pro or a con, depending on you. Getting all collectibles becomes much harder though, so it also depends if you just want to complete the levels or perfect them.","April 14, 2014","true","8.6"," 27 of 74 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","27","74","0","0"

What I liked about this one in particular is that it's not too frustrating compared to others of it's kind, and also the fact that even coming up to the end levels, the game introduced new elements to help/hinder the player. It can be played as a very casual game to pick up when bored and the achievements for the game are very reasonable.\n\nThere is something very satisfying when completing a level in this game, makes you feel good when you manage to perform all the actions as reflex in rapid succession.","September 28, 2014","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I am surprised no one mentions the odd resolution which makes the game bulge out like an old tube television. While it was an interesting choice I found it hampered my skill to survive the simple levels. The levels themselves don't look half bad but I could not see far enough ahead to dodge the various traps, which seemed quite unfair. Even the character himself seemed too floaty for you to feel completely in control in a platformer designed around simply surviving. You can collect what are essentially coins but it is not required which makes it even simpler. The chasing mechanic around the enemies was what originally brought me in but even then it seemed they get cut off at checkpoints. Terrible choice. The biggest thing that confuses me however is how 29 people (as of this writing) found a review which calls this game a "rouge-like" helpful. Even comparing this to Super Meat Boy hurts my soul. Roguelikes are obviously more fun, difficult, and have gameplay that draws you in and steals away days of your life. Super Meat Boy drives you insane with its difficulty, but the character controls like a dream and when you beat a level you feel good about mastering it. Mechanic Escape felt like a online Flash game which just annoyed me, especially when the character would randomly wall-kick when I was timing my jumps perfectly. All in all, I am just glad I got this game for free. the best thing about this? Free cards.","May 26, 2015","false","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is very rage inducing, and is similar to Super Meat Boy (Just not as good). It has an average concept; but I think that they should develop at least some kind of story as to why he's running round like a headless chicken looking for mechanical parts.\n\nGood Things-\nInteresting Concept.\nEnjoyable\n\nBad Things-\nRepetitive\nRage Inducing\nNo Storyline.\nBoring.","May 16, 2015","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rakanishuman/recommended/268240/","rakanishuman","Nyah!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rakanishuman/","687 products in account","Mechanic Escape is a game i was not impressed with. I am surprised no one mentions the odd resolution which makes the game bulge out like an old tube television. While it was an interesting choice I found it hampered my skill to survive the simple levels. The levels themselves don't look half bad but I could not see far enough ahead to dodge the various traps, which seemed quite unfair. Even the character himself seemed too floaty for you to feel completely in control in a platformer designed around simply surviving. You can collect what are essentially coins but it is not required which makes it even simpler. The chasing mechanic around the enemies was what originally brought me in but even then it seemed they get cut off at checkpoints. Terrible choice. The biggest thing that confuses me however is how 29 people (as of this writing) found a review which calls this game a "rouge-like" helpful. Even comparing this to Super Meat Boy hurts my soul. Roguelikes are obviously more fun, difficult, and have gameplay that draws you in and steals away days of your life. Super Meat Boy drives you insane with its difficulty, but the character controls like a dream and when you beat a level you feel good about mastering it. Mechanic Escape felt like a online Flash game which just annoyed me, especially when the character would randomly wall-kick when I was timing my jumps perfectly. All in all, I am just glad I got this game for free. the best thing about this? Free cards.","May 26, 2015","false","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
