First of all the game does not work in full screen view, this is an amazing design feature as now people with low-end rigs will be able to play this game, maybe the devs copied Realm Of The Mad God a game that can only be played in windowed mode. Secondly the interface is also amazing the spinning basketball in the top left really creates next generation physics and graphics. Also the fact that there is no tutorial and I still have not played a game yet because I don't know how really shows the devs respect long time gamers of this franchise. The game also has very long load times that means you can do other things while it loads amazing work from the devs. The game also has no Licensing this mean the actual names of teams have been edited for a more emersive experiance, my local team is now called the 'Niwcastle Eegles'. In conclustion I would say this game is very much in contertion for GOTY and possibly even game of the decade if there is one, I am looking forward to World Basketball Manager 2011 and can't wait for future updates to make the game even better. £0.34 well spent.\n10.2/10","December 24, 2014","true","0.4"," 26 of 44 people (59%) found this review helpful 43 people found this review funny","59","26","44","43","2"

Add a dreadfully slow player database on top of an eyesore background color and this is nothing short of a disaster.\n\nI did find their database comical in the sense that they copied all real world player/team names and made one vowel changes to those names.

As far as I can tell it's just a series of menus.
