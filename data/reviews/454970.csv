There are a few small things I would change to make this game a little less punishing.\n\n1. Let the arrow keys move the character a bit while falling. I'm aware that gravity changes allow you to change your course, however it'd be nice to be able to rely on falling to do things and to counteract the intertia you invariably have when coming off a ledge.\n\n2. Give a bit of leeway on the outside of the map for falling or whatever. It'd be nioce if you could extend the buffer to about 3 or 4 tiles so that going off the map isn't insta-death. If something is insta-death then use spikes instead.\n\n3. A windowed mode?\n\nHowever, it is a challenging game and I can see the fun in it.","April 15","true","0.6"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","17","18","2","0"

But of course the game lack of puzzle and more of 'don't fall out of the border' the game as that is going to happen a lot. The music is great but with only one music throughout the whole game will drain you out soon enough. Overall it is a mediocre game and could have been more better if puzzle elements are much more focus in the game rather than having death traps everywhere.","May 17","true","0.6"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Unfortunately, its far from it. Just watch the reviews: barely anyone exceeds 3 hours of play time. The game is hard and unforgiving (intentionnaly), you are given fast movement which is nice, but everything makes you want to go as slowly as possible, as your worst enemy will be the edges of the screen.\nGravity Den is colorful, but really lacks context (story, characters, special effects..).\nMy last negative point would be the nearly impossible achievements, moreover on the map, we cannot know in which level we completed the achievement, which is frustrating.\n\nMy final verdict would be 'Nice try, but meh'.","May 22","false","25.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"
