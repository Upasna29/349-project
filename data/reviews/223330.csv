Many quests, including story missions, have several variants of solution. For the first time at the Sea Dogs series appeared craft and alchemy.\n\nDisadvantages: old graphic and restrictions of old game engine. Do not forget that it's an indi project of amateur stidio.\n\nIf you like games about pirates, where you need to think, not just swing a cutlass, if you like bright characters, historical accuracy (many characters are real historical people) - well then, it is a game for you.\n\n9/10 (not 10 points due to old graphic)\n\nP. S. I play Sea Dogs and Age of Pirates series during 5 years, and I hope, that this series of games will continue to evolve.","January 31","true","474.7"," 62 of 65 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","62","65","3","5"

Developed by Akella.  This is actually the SIXTH game in the series.  Sea Dogs, POTC (Sea Dogs Modification, SD2, the bad disney production), Age of Pirates (AoP) , Tortuga - Two Treasures, AoP2:COAS (City of Abandoned Ships) , and POTEHO (SDTEHO). Black Mark Studios has most of the original modders and designs from the original games.  SDTEHO has MANY of the same landmarks as COAS and similar quests.  Personally, I am partial to COAS for many reasons, but predominantly the freedom to do whatever the hell you want very early.\n\nThere are several other distinct subset series mods as well both from Russian (Ukraine), and the the generated POTC Build Mod, Gentlemen of Fortune and "Eras" mods.  The one that is most notable is the "Gentlemen of Fortune" (GoF) + Eras which makes the game even more massive in terms of gameplay, but "cryptic" terms of controls and difficulty.\n\nIn order to enjoy THIS game, a player has to be willing "take the pain up the bunghole", at least initially anyway.\nIt is rogue style, you die, you are DEAD.\nYou will die.\nYou will get frustrated.\nYou will get angry.\nYou will probably curse at your computer.\nYou will probably curse at Akella / BlackMark Studio developers.\nYou might even curse in Russian if you know the language.\nSave your game, OFTEN.\nI do mean A LOT.\nYou may even have to revert to an earlier stage because you missed something critical.\nIf you do not and end up on the main screen staring and saying "WTF!" because you just lost 10 hours of gameplay, it is YOUR fault.\n\nI REALLY mean that.\nThis game can be incredibly unforgiving at times.\nI was part of the design production team of the original English release of AoP2:  COAS, but passed on the English translation of SDTEHO, because even the updated Storm Engine is not aging well and problems with the original English release.  Currently the translation to English is absolutely insanely laughable at times, but most of us left that understand the game engine are probably not going to fix this game in the series this time round as Akella still has not learned their lessons.  Additionally, the entire source is not available inside the game anyway as it is ENCRYPTED.  Thanks Akella.\n\nThere are quests on this particular game that will give you more game rage that you have ever experienced in previous series.  "The Gambit" comes to mind, sailing in "real time" and even with time compression is laborious.  Most people have not seen the endings of the later games due to difficulty or just throw up their hands and go, "I quit".\n"Silly gamers, SDTEHO is not for kids..."\n\nBasically the gameplay provides a very solid RGP single player experience, but the controls are still ARCHAIC, graphics are aging (lack of intiial DirectX 9 support is UNACCEPTABLE this is 2016!), hit detection is average, and this game WILL NOT HOLD YOUR HAND.\n\nThere are no "arrows" to guide you.\nYou need to WRITE DOWN things in order to remember them.\nYou need to do some research on how to do things, because the game will not tell you how to do them even with the extra long tutorial.\nThere are a lot of game mechanic concepts that have to be understood UPFRONT.\nCombat can be unfair and brutish for the unprepared.\nLandmarks and graphics are RECYCLED from all previous games (with some small expanded list of new areas and features such as ships decks).\nItems are GREATLY expanded, which magic and alchemy all over the place.\nIt adds a new twist to the game series.\nThere are NO FULL VOICE OVERS (that are unrelated to dialogue), so get used to it, or move on.\nFailure to read dialogue can result in game failure, and some things are ONLY said ONCE!\nYou are not in a "Captain Blood" novel here.\nYou need to earn your place in order to be successful.\nYou will need to spend a LOT of time in order to build up your skills.\nOnce you master the mechanics you will have a great time, but that will require about 8-10 hours at least if you have never played the series before.\n\nAge of Pirates Words of Wisdom:  "Rewards come to those that are patient".\nCan you pass the test?","April 22","true","0.7"," 28 of 30 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","28","30","3","0"

A milestone in sea games.\n\nI was thoroughly impressed with the first Sea Dogs title, their sequels - Pirates of the Caribbean, Age of Pirates/Age of Pirates 2 City of Abandoned Ships which makes this game, the logical continuation of that tradition from Akella to make these games (although now they just earn money as a publisher since they own the rights to the game).\nOn a technical level this is the same Age of Pirates with numerous additions. Think of it as the Warband of Mount & Blade.\n\nThe story got much better since the first Age of Pirates. Continuing with the good tradition of CAS (Age of Pirates 2) story and quests got a special spotlight, many of them are randomly generated.\nYou play Charles de Maure, a french aristocrat who came to the New World to help his brother. Eventually you get entangled in politics, earning a revenue all the time to fight off scurvy and... boredom in the sea. This is a slow game.\nRelationships with factions, bounties on your head, pirating, bribing - all of it is improved and refined to make a believable experience.\n\nUnlike more arcade games this one is hard. It plays by the logic of a 15 year old mentality.\nLife in the sea is hard, sailing is slow, authenticity to the maximum. This isn't for everyone.\n\nI consider this a great expansion if you loved the previous games. It is hard to get in if you never played anything like this before. Learning the ropes may proove difficult since the game doesn't like to hold your hand at all.\nLike a newborn baby you'll try to hold on to every possible hook on getting your sailor life easier.\nThe tutorial exists though. If you were looking for such an experience than this is the closest you'll get in he forseeable future.\n\nSince there's no English version yet (reportedly coming this summer) everything will be in Russian. Thus, this can only be recommended to those passionate about naval adventures, and a realistic RPG/simulation of sailing. If you watched Pirates of the Caribbean a  million times - this is for you.\nTo those who stay, take care of CTD's and freezes. The age of exploration is nigh. Save often!","May 2, 2015","true","104.1"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","3"

The game is so big you feel you have to play it everyday to finish your goals. As I said the, game is really REALLY hard when it comes to complete quests and finish the objectives. It requires a lot of patience and it can be completely frustrating. The stories are amazing, and it has a lot of dialoges giving you the ambience of being a pirate. Finally, the joy of boarding other ships, plunder treasures, kill soldiers, pirates and travel all over the caribbean is priceless. I recommend this game, but only for those who really like challenges.","April 24","true","128.0"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"

The game runs very smoothly. In 100+h i experienced a dozen CTD only.\n\nA lot of changes compared to Age of Pirate 2, no more skillbooks, but now you have amulets that give temporary bonus. And there is a new crafting system.\n\nAlso ship rank requirements have been revised, but you will still need to work your way in navigation before you can afford those huge deck guns.\n\nIn general the ergonomy of the game is much better, a new key for looting corpse, no more crew following and blocking you everywhere on deck when it is cleared from ennemies, new muskets and carbine...\n\nAfter a long wait the game is now in english, sometime very poorly translated and you cant understand anything, but devs are improving this with every patch.\n\nFor newcomers i strongly suggest to read the community forum here since the game has no manual, and many features and commands arent shown in tutorial or cant be keymapped (like time acceleration). The game can be frustrating if you never experienced Seadogs, but once you master all its tricks (fencing mode...) it is a very enjoyable game and will bring you hundreds of hours of fun.","March 10","true","2.3"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

I had played the classics "Pirates!", "Sea Legends", "Big Sea", "1869: History Experience" and many many more before that, but "Pirates of the Caribbean" was the one to keep me entertained for... well... years, actually. It just had everything: sailing, naval battle, exploration of many different areas of the isles on foot, trading, raiding forts and much more. The soundtrack was absolutely enchanting and while the game had a bit of a console feel to it (and a few bugs), it was just amazing. The two "Age of Pirates" games were great as well, but they had no real main story (at least not to the extent of the predecessor) - instead you could create your own character and just be free in the caribbean. Sounded nice on paper, but playing the game felt a bit redundant.\n(My REAL problem with those games was the atrocious StarForce copy protection on the disks. I just don't like rootkits on my PC, so I installed them both exactly once and when I grew tired of them, I uninstalled them, never to turn back to them again. "Better go back to Sea Dogs 2", I thought for many years.)\n\nIt's been SEVEN YEARS since the last instalment in the series and now there's finally a brand-new game! And thankfully, it offers everything the great "Sea Dogs 2/Pirates of the Caribbean" offered. Here, we FINALLY have the good old feeling of being back in the caribbean. There's only one character to choose, just as in Sea Dogs 2, and it's great because it comes with a strong story hook (no pun intended).\n\nOf course, the game's engine feels exactly like the one from 2003.\nYeah, the voice acting is borderline silly. And yes, apart from SOME(!) high-res textures, the graphics seem like they are from 2006 or something.\nAnd yes, instead of video sequences that tell the story, you get most of the exposition by dialog boxes (almost like in those anime visual novels).\nHOWEVER: This really *IS* what the perfect pirate game should feel like. It's a bit wonky, yes, but it's worth every second of your time, without a doubt. Here's why:\n\nWant to sail your ship from island to island with the possibility of switching to real-time every second? You can!\nWant to buy and sell ships, freight, loot and other items, equipping the best weapons and armor to improve your stats? Then do that!\nWant to explore all the different islands on foot and discover exciting areas? This game has that, and it's gorgeous!\nWant to engage in exciting naval battles with the option of boarding enemy ships, attacking the enemy sailors with swords and guns, advancing to the captain's quarters in order to finish him and take over the ship? That's what this game is best at!! :)\nWant to raid cities/forts the same way - by attacking them with your fleet and then finishing them off with swords and guns? Heeeell yeah, go for it!!\n\nUp until now, this game hasn't had all that much of attention (let alone media coverage), which is an absolute shame because it clearly deserves it! These developers DESERVE to finally have real success with their creation! So even if it's a pirate game: don't pirate it! Support these guys!!\n\nIf you've ever thought "A pirate I was meant to be, trim the sails and roam the sea...", THIS is the perfect game for you!","March 31","true","9.7"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

It has a good, long main quest and several additional ones, which entangle you in local political intrigues and take many hours to complete. Also this missions allow you to put your hands on some neat unique ships and equipment.\n\nHowever, we all know, that people play games like this to do pirate stuff: robbing sea trade caravans and burning colonies, searching for pirate treasures, boarding ships, killing people in scores, drinking, gambling and spending money, that you fairly stole from others. And the game allows you to do all of this.\n\nAlso you can trade in colonial goods, deposit your money, defend traders and colinies, do some missions for island governors, deliver food for some shipwrecked scum (srsly wtf), even play as Caribbean Uber driver.. I mean Uber captain. But honestly, who does that in a game about pirates?\n\nBefore conclusion - several positives and negatives about the game:\n\npros: you can marry a redhead tomboy cutlass-wielding pirate beauty, who loves you above everything in the world and constantly wants you to bang her.\n\ncons: she isn't real and you realize you (most likely) never find anyone like her irl. Also it gets a bit annoying after she drags you into hired room to have sex with her every time you visit a tavern.\n\nAlso game is kinda buggy, crashes from time to time and quest log sometimes is very cryptic, so you'll probably need help to complete them quests.\n\nConclusion:\n\n10/10 if you don't mind outdated graphics, occasional poor quest design and protagonist's wife's nymphomaniac tendencies.","April 20","true","304.5"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","86","12","14","8","0"

I've spent immeasurable hours playing Pirates of the Carribean (basically sea dogs 2) and I still needed to check the guides in the forum and on pirates ahoy to get my head around some of the basic controls and to understand what to look for in quests.\n\nHowever, once you get through all that, it's a really rewarding experience. Sure they've recycled the lighthouse from POTC and sure the translation is sometimes abysmal and the graphics are pretty much the same as in POTC (a 2003 game), however that is to be expected from a £13 game.\n\nThe quests don't guide you as much as you'd like but this is what makes the game even more rewarding for me. Combat is unforgiving and if you haven't saved in a while you WILL regret it. Think of it like dark souls in that manner but simpler, without the gore and you create the checkpoints. This does mean that you might have to revert to multiple previous checkpoints depending how much you messed up. The tutorial is quite long and not as descriptive as a tutorial should be, definitely something that needs to be patched.\n\nOther than that, once you get through those snags, the carribean is your oyster. All those (albeit copy/paste) reviews here on steam still tell the truth. This is a really good game if you like the whole pirate/RPG genre, the fact that I have played 45.9 hours in one week is quite indicative. I wholeheartedly recommend it for the price, would pay £30 if it were decently translated and had a better tutorial, would pay £50 if they also included graphics that were 2008-2010 standard (of course without sacrificing smoothness of play).","May 3","true","58.1"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

My earlier 9.1 hour fail was the result of me trying to find a way to just "not do" the tutorial, or to figure it out on my own. Let me be clear, I still feel that this is extremely poor for a game developer of any level, to make their tutorial like this. My earlier frustration still applies, SAVE BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING,... EVERY ... DARN... TIME... PERIOD.. because if you don't during the tutorial it is VERY possible to lose the quest, and then you're done, and have to start over.\n\nAfter getting to the open world, it was a breath of fresh air, though still very difficult to climb out of the starter ship (Lugger). I'm enjoying myself now and a whole series of new frustrations but for the most part these are negligable. The game is worth it, you just have to surrender a couple hours at the start to do the manditory tutorial using a walkthru and resist the urge to do anything else until it's done.\n\n-----\n\nThe single most frustrating and completely pointless "tutorial" ever. Basically if you don't do everything they want you to perfectly, you cannot play the rest of the game. The tutorial is REQUIRED, you MUST complete it or the world does not "unlock". Oh, and by the way, you pretty much "have to" follow a guide, the instructions provided in game are really easy to miss, not detailed in any way and its' really easy to get lost or mess up a quest. THere's no reset there's no pity.\n\nSAVE BEFORE AND AFTER EVERYTHING YOU DO.\nI mean everything.\n\nI've got hours into this game... HOURS... trying to follow the guides...\n\nI'm done. It was a waste of money. The people who love this game will call me all kinds of names but... I don't play games so that I can spend all my time googling why's and how's and wtf's   I play games to have fun. The fun in this game is locked behind a difficulty wall. I'm not going to waste any more time trying to get there.\n\nFor those of you considering purchasing this, if you're into games that are difficult because of their obscurity and it's kind of a rite of passage to acheive things... then great, this is for you.\n\nIf you're into games where you get to sail a ship and be a pirate... and you actually want to "do" that on the first night you play this game... guess what... this game is not for you. Don't spend the money.","April 2","true","91.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Not sure if it is even possible.\n\n+ many possibilities = content\n+ many hours of gameplay is real\n+ devs seem like they care about players opinion\n+ active community\n\n- nightmare for beginners - need to learn everything by yourself. Why not start with more corridor level tutorial to explain some basics. Even simpler games do it\n- tutorial island = NotLikeThis - I was stuck many times just finding quests to gain money for crew and a ship. Had to cheat another 8000 pesos with card games and constant saving after win\n- unbalanced world, e.g. some pirates looks totally same like the others, but they're much more powerful and kill you by one swing\n- no help to navigate you to the right direction. You just click on everybody if they have any quests\n- enemy/companion AI ? Not going to talk about it much, AI of a carp\n- controls are meh, you can't even set a different button on some\n- camera is your enemy sometimes >(\n- acceleration to speed up e.g. endless walking through jungle. Srsly, there wasn't any other option?\n- a lot of long unnecessary reading, skipmania for non-native english speakers\n- could really use simpler interface - e.g. trading, looting ...\n- music, sometimes repetitive and annoying - you can find better license free music on the internet\n- characters get stuck a lot in narrow interiors (e.g. quest in a cave on tutorial island. worst)\n- could use more different characters to start with, like in other games with this engine\n- english translation made by google\n- little sad about first DLC, hoped for more rw material. Also why not focus on a main game, when it is in a state that it is?\n\nStart of the game is really scary and I think it is not the right way to make new players continue playing. They'll just refund it.","February 29","false","12.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

And steep learning-curves and frustration! I was going to write a positive review, but after much consideration I cannot bring myself to; This game is not something anyone can pick up and enjoy, no it is quite the opposite. You have to already know how to play an Akella Corsair game to get any enjoyment out of Sea Dogs: TEHO. Though I personally enjoy it, there isn't much good I can say about it.\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\n"WHAT WERE THEY THINKING WHEN THEY DID X!?" crosses my mind a lot when I dive into this game, there are some truly ♥♥♥♥ poor and outright stupid design choices which absolutely drive me up the wall.\n\nNaval Combat: Without fail the most excruciating part of this game, it is both enjoyable, and truly unbearable. "ridiculous", "slow-paced", "boring", "repetitious" are some of the words I think to myself when ever I get stuck in a 2 hour long battle, you will spend more time firing hopelessly at an enemy, at point blank range MISSING every shot and if on the off chance you actually hit them, it will do ♥♥♥♥-all damage to them, and they will be doing more or less the same thing, but every shot hitting your vessel and destroying your sails and crew, but miraculously not damaging your hull, it is like being stuck in a perpetual state of limbo, there's no way of escaping it. You can't destroy your enemy, you can't surrender, you've just got to pray to Zeus that just maybe the weather will change, they'll sail away, or try to board you (Spoiler: Neither of those things happen.)\n\nLearning Curve: Like I said at the beginning: You need to know how to play a game from the Corsair franchise to even begin playing this game. Keep a guide and a map of the Caribbean handy, otherwise you'll be dead in the water, not knowing where anything is, what to do or how to make it off of the first island. With that said, doing as I suggested still won't get you far as the developers have changed/broken a lot from it's predecessor (Age of Pirates 2: City of Abandoned Ships.)\n\nSkills: I'll get back to you when I actually figure out how they work. It worked in AoP2, doesn't work here. A lot of the time your skills will be drained, and there won't be any indication of what is causing this to happen.\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nI few smaller complaints:\n\nMusic: Mute it straight away. Gets old fast\n\nLand Combat: Too easy, pretty fun though.\n\nQuests: Escort missions all over the place, and that is all I have to say about that.\n\nRole-Playing: If you were expecting to play the role of a privateer or even a captain serving in a navy like in AoP2: Don't, there is no role playing allowed here.\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nBy all means buy this game *if* you are a fan of previous Corsair games like AoP2, but to new players that are interested in acquiring this game: Do not buy it. Spare yourself the headaches and tears and torrent Age of Pirates 2: City of Abandoned Ships, far superior and easier to get into and enjoy.","May 4","false","59.9"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","31","4","13","0","0"

It looked liked a good successor of AoP2:CoAS.\nThe problem is, that the game is too unbalanced. You work hard just to get a weak 5th class ship and for what?? To be constantly harrassed by 4th, 3rd and 2nd class pirate ships?? That just isn't fun.... Oh and the skill progression is so slow that even my dead grandmother is faster than that. AoP2 was full of bugs, yes... but it still was fun and a lot more playable than this. For example, I always got plenty of quest from governors, always something else, but completable. But here??? I get always the same naval missions everywhere, and it really sucks because with that good for nothing lugger I can't finish the quest!! So I'm very sorry, but I don't recommend this game, unless you are patient, and willing to invest hundreds of hours to get something decent.","May 22","false","18.8"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","3","12","0","0"

For those that read this, understand that the game is poorly translated from russian, and is by no-means 100% accurate. I want you to imagine that the devs put all of the game's dialogue into google translate, and maybe that will prepare you for the difficulties ahead.\nIf you played Sea Dogs 2/ Pirates of the Caribbean, the 2003 game published by bethesda, don't expect the same level of quality from this. That is the mistake I made. I understand that for 15 dollars, it is a good game, However, this is far slower than the originals and more difficult, so make your decision wisely.\nI'd give this a 4.5/10, if 10 was the aforementioned game.","April 19","false","2.3"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","0"

This game has frustrated me so much. All the hallmarks of a great game but frustration at every point. Ridiculous long tutorial which you have to go through at the start, and this will happen unless you save very regularly. No manual. Poorly defined goals. When you die you have to go through 4+ screens to reload. I've just done this 10 times trying to fight some indians. Pressing E (draws your sword) by accident can cause people to attack, you die, you reload. Ug.

BlackMark Studio take on the Golden Age of Piracy begins in 1715, and is presented with a much-appreciated lighter tone that isn’t afraid to make fun of itself in the name of an entertaining journey.\n\nSailing across the massive expanse of The Caribbean, exploring gorgeous and unique islands, and getting yourself into all sorts of swashbuckling trouble provide some of the most rewarding and memorable stretches of gameplay I’ve experienced all year.\n\nEven after putting in well over 50 hours with the Xbox 360, Xbox One, Wii U, PC, PlayStation 3, and PlayStation 4 versions, I’m still discovering new islands to explore.\n\nNo matter which console you decide to play Sea Dogs: To Each His Own on, you can rest easy knowing that it’s one of the best looking games of 2016. The current-gen versions build upon the gorgeous unity engine by showcasing well-lit, tropical locales and the amazing water effects on the open seas. And on next gen, the experience is even more impressive thanks to minimal loading and maximum draw distances that seem to go on for miles.\n\nThe way the camera zooms out when your ship reaches its maximum speed, the speakers bombard you with the sounds of the wind, and the sunset turns blood-orange, is simply amazing. The PS4 and Xbox One versions are nearly identical,Which in turn means there both ♥♥♥♥ compaired to the PC version.\n\nThe amazing world of Sea Dogs: To Each His Own has kept me gladly occupied for longer than any other game in the series, even though its story isn’t the strongest. At no point in my dozens of hours was I ever at a loss for something to do. Simply sailing wherever the wind takes me and seeing what sort of trouble I can get into is a complete joy.\n\nBeyond the underwhelming main campaign, Sea Dogs: To Each His Own delivers a world brimming with gorgeous places to go, amazing secrets to discover, and nefarious pirates to stab.\n\nAll and all the game would be an amazing experience to have on steam if I could get past the main menu. 11/2 Do not buy this piece of ♥♥♥♥.","February 15","false","0.2"," 4 of 31 people (13%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","13","4","31","2","1"
