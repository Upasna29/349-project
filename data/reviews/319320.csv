At its core, it's a relatively easy point-and-click adventure, featuring (rather) beautiful scenes, attractive Hidden Object screens and some small puzzles. Both puzzles and hidden object screens are quite easy, so that even complete strangers to this kind of game will find something to their liking here. The story of the game, still the core of any adventure, is however rather bland, especially during the first third of the game. Featuring the same female protagonist as in the earlier two games in this series, the game tells about the need to "save the world" and how Esther manages to do so by altering the past, in order to save the future. With the help of Time Crystals, she can travel to different dates in the past and search for clues in order to avoid the upcoming catastrophy. It's nothing original, but the story picks up after some time and kept me interested during the latter part of this (rather short) game.\n\nThis edition also contains a bonus chapter which tells the same story from another point of view: a neat touch that added not only an hour of extra gameplay, but an original view on the game a well. While the visuals are up to Artifex Mundi's high standards, the sounds certainly are not. The voice-acting is one of the worst I've yet heard in a game by Artifex Mundi: completely artificial and never giving any character something like a personality. The music is too repetitive: I muted it very early in the game. As ususal, Steam integration is perfect, complete with trading cards and a series of easy-to-get achievements which should give you another "perfect game" without much as a hassle.\n\nAll in all, I'd like to give this game a "neutral" recommendation, but since the quality of Artifex Mundi does shimmer through even in one of their weakest game, I will still give a "thumbs up" - but there are many other, more recent, Artifex Mundi-games  out there that offer much better quality.\n\nOverall score: 6/10.","April 7, 2015","true","4.7"," 31 of 35 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","31","35","0","5"

Mechanically stable, playeable without problems.   BUT!  It's an incredible letdown and disappointment for an Artifex Mundi game. If you want to get a fantastic HOG, not only an "okay" one, check out other Mundi titles, as Time Mysteries is incredible weak compared to their other games.\nA little longer:\nTime Mysteries: The Final Enigma is the third and final episode of the Time Mysteries series. I really hoped that the game will improve compared to the second title, but sadly it didn't succeed. They used almost (completely?) same sound track as in the second one, the bonus chapter recycled who HO scenes - it's not a big problem, but foreshadows other issues.\nI just can't believe that this is a Mundi Game.  This came out in January 2013. Enigmatis 2 maybe in August, same year. The quality difference between the two games is like they were made  DECADES apart from eachother.\nI'm not joking - while Enigmatis titles and Grim Tales features the most beautiful animations I've ever seen in HOGs, Time Mysteries' character animation is much closer to Fallout 2's talking head animations than other recent Mundi titles.  I just don't know - they piled all funds for Enigmatis? Or had serious deadline-issues with the (whole!) Time Mysteries project, or it was designed to be a lower-budget game? I'm really curious about this.\nAlthough it's quite common in HOG that they feature strange logic or storytelling sometimes, sadly T.M: t.F.E. also features one of the weakest plot I've seen in HOGs. The antagonist literally tells you that you wouldn't get his motivation, so he don't tell you anything why he did what he did - the act that set the whole 3-episode saga into motion.\nAlso there were lots of puzzles that's design was quite flawed. I've seen 4 (!) puzzles that required you to guess the correct order of 3 things without any clue, and one "play back the notes" game that was so fast and started instantly that you couldn't see the original order, and there was no option to repeat it. So, back to guessing again.   Also the gameplay was greatly elongated by "cheese mechanics": you found a key besides a safe, only to open a door in the precious room to find the safe's handle there. I know, this is base HOG-mechanic: but there was so many place when you could feel that item placement makes no sense, they just wanted to insert another item to make the game longer. Somehow the game missed the atmosphere and logic that usually makes you believe or at least okay with this "inflated gameplay time" - here there was no such thing.\nIf you're still with me:   I really do love Mundi games, I think they are one of the best HOG in terms of quality, I would rate them differently from the most other HOG games because of their exceptional graphics and content.  But it would be a lie to say this game is exceptional - besides the still quite beautiful graphics, this is not more than an ordinary HOG.   But as a Mundi product, the quality of ordinary is sadly a big-big negative adjective. This game could be so much more  :\\nFinal verdict: Okay-good HOG, but a big letdown if you ecpect Artifex Mundi quality.","December 26, 2014","true","6.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

I started with the Nightmares from the Deep series and progressed onward from there, after loving all three installments. However, Time Mysteries is the one series from this publisher that I just cannot sink my teeth into.\n\nI find the overall story and end conclusion to this particular series rather boring, dry and uninteresting. Story aside, Time Mysteries 3 itself is extremely easy where gameplay is concerned. I finished the entire game, including the bonus chapter, in a little over 2 hours. Both the puzzles and the hidden object sections posed absolutely zero challenge for me whatsoever.\n\nAs always, the art in the game is beautiful and should be noted. It's always incredible, the level of detail that the artists put into their work with Artifex Mundi games. The soundtrack in Time Mysteries 3 is also incredible, and it gives a laid back, folk-styled atmosphere to the game.\n\nUnfortunately, however, I am not going to recommend this installment into the Artifex Mundi library; there are simply far better games from this publisher on Steam. Literally every other series except the Time Mysteries trilogy is exceptional. I picked this title up on sale for about $3.00, but the asking price of $10.00 is quite steep for such little, and easy, game time; despite the wonderful soundtrack and art. If the puzzles had been more challenging, I may have given this a recommendation.\n\nRating: 1.5/5.0 - It's bad.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","November 4, 2015","false","3.1"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

As a pretty avid Hidden Object Gamer, I love Artifex Mundi and all their work. If you're familiar with them, you already know that many of their games share a similar engine and similar play styles. This usually makes it easy for one to write a review about, but Time Mysteries is a difficult series, one which I believe I may find myself split on with a Mixed Rating\n\nTime Mysteries is probably the single trilogy that seems to not get the positive ratings that Artifex games always get. I can tell particularly, several reasons why. It is hard for me to speak on this series, given that I have only played 75% of the way through of this particular game, which happens to be the last. Therefore, I didn't want to judge too quickly, but I've noticed these several things enough that I feel I can speak as to the pros and cons of this installment. I have sunk maybe an hour or two into it, which if you know Artifex Mundi, you know that their games are short, but never lacking in content that truely makes the game. Artifex Mundi is known for its' great puzzles, HOGs, and storylines. These are the issues that I find are excellent and poor points of The Final Enigma...\n\nPros:\n- As always, beautiful scenery and great artwork\n- The time travel element of the game is great. Using the special time clock you have is almost like using the map in other Artifex games, but something about it is just different and fun! :D\n- The story is very solid\n- Dozens of areas in the game to go to, more so than past games\n- The cutscenes can be amazing (at some points. It seems that AM has possibly changed up their cutscene style??\n\nCons:\n- The voice acting in AM games can be a bit corny, but we deal with this because we love AM! But, this game, barring the protagonist, has a fair amount of poor voice acting.\n- Sometimes, the voices can sound overdriven or not mixed so well.\n- The puzzles difficulty level vary rapidly. I've found extremely easy and difficult ones just as well. This is probably a game to play on the Expert mode.\n- The cutscenes can be poor (at a minimal level, only sometimes).\n\n\nVerdict?\n\n5/10  - Sorry Artifex, I love you, I really do. The Final Enigma wasn't all that I expected. the mixed and negative reviews made me think that they were people who just weren't that into HOGing or Artifex in general. Upon playing this game, I realized why the reception was so mixed.\n\nThe first Time Mysteries is about to be released on Steam (after a reconstruction process, this is why some of the first games from the AM trilogy are currently missing). Before I write this series off as a sub-par trilogy, I would like to play through the entire series. The second and third (this one) have often recieved a thumbs down or negative reviews. It is probably for the above reasons that I am truely split on this game. For the first time I actually do wish Steam had a "Neutrul" Button. I WILL recommend this for the time being. Why? Because it has a bold, newer style to it. The way that you travel throughout time and space is very cool. Also, the concept of the entire game (and probably series) is an interesting one.\n\nGive it a chance if you love Artifex Mundi or Hidden Object Gaming. You might just like it. For those who are not sure about it, this probably isn't for you if you're casting even a little doubt. I would highly recommend these AM titles; Grim Legends, Nightmares of the Deep, or Enigmatis.","June 3, 2015","true","1.7"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

The protagonist also seems to be... well... kind of dumb, discarding objects after one use for seemingly no reason, when they could easily come in useful again later. However, so far i'm finding it oddly addicting. I've played hidden object games before of course, however it isn't a genre i'm usually interested in. This is different though, adding in the very interesting mechanics of being able to time travel and see your changes in the past reflected in the future. There's also sometimes quite a delay between finding an item and being able to use it, or vice versa, giving that lovely eureka feeling of "OH I remember what I do with this". The puzzles aren't too difficult, just enough to make you think but not enough to frustrate you, with lots of variety in the types of puzzles you have to solve, ranging from simple "find these items" to connecting fuses in a way that reminds me a little of Bioshock's pipe puzzles. This game ended up surprised me in being a lovely game to play casually to wind down in the evenings.","January 21, 2015","true","3.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

A solid ending to a hidden object game trilogy.\n\nLong version:One of the largest problem with Time Mysteries 2 was the lack of story and continuity with the first game. Final Enigma chose the opposite path: not only it’s completely plot-focused, but it features characters and places from both previous games. Sure, it’s basically a huge rip-off of Terminator, but fits well into the established canon.\n\nIt seems the story was such a priority that the development team forgot to work on the puzzles; they pose absolutely no challenge. Even the hidden object scenes are a letdown with only a few dozen items per scene. The contrast is even more apparent in the bonus chapter, which reuses parts of the second episode. (It also lacks any original content, making it possibly the laziest bonus episode we have seen in a hidden object puzzle game.)\n\nTo sum it up, if you have been along for the ride since the Inheritance or if you would like a nice and easy HO game for a change, then it’s more than recommended to get this one.","December 5, 2014","true","4.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Positives include (as always) outstanding art, good voice acting, fun puzzles, casual difficulty, and the time warp mechanism really allows for enjoyable gameplay. The story is also perhaps slightly stronger or at least more interesting than most, which also brings me to the biggest knock on the game, and that is the overall brevity. I completed it in under two hours, all while actively watching TV, doing design work, and talking on the phone. I would estimate that it is probably half as long as the average Artifex title.

Like the first two, the puzzles are straightforward and it shouldn't take you long to finish the game and get all the achievements. The voice acting is still bad, but the writing has improved a bit for this one and sends you in better time-looped circles than the first two.\nImprovement in the graphics is sadly offset by typos in the main menu and game text, and some explanatory text which doesn't make sense (have a look at the chess game puzzle). To top off the 'we rushed this' attitude, the trading cards still have the Time Mysteries 2 logo on them.\n\nAfter being a bit more impressed with the Nightmares hidden object games, playing through all three of these games I keep coming back to the same thought - there's a really neat concept here with the time travelling family with its roots in the Merlin mythology that's been butchered and given poor, rushed execution. While this continuation of the story is an improvement, the series still leaves a bitter aftertaste in knowing it could have been done so much better.","February 14","false","3.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Unlike Time Mysteries 2, this game had a great variety of puzzles, so that it wasn't a non-stop parade of the same hidden object scenes over and over again. None of the non-HOG puzzles were obtuse, another welcome change from TM2. Also, there was an adorable puppy right at the start of the game, and numerous other cute animals sprinkled throughout (yet another thing TM2 lacked).\n\nI didn't play through this game on Expert mode due to my poor experience with the second game, so if you prefer playing it on that mode I can't vouch for how the constant time-hopping would make it tedious via having to manually hunt through every room for a new hidden object hotspot. There were far fewer HOG scenes in this game than in TM2, though, and the game's design is so much better than its predecessor that it shouldn't be that onerous of an experience.\n\nThe weakest part of the game was the storyline. I had just come off the confusing Time Mysteries 2 (and I've never played the first title), so I didn't understand what was going on early on in the game. I soon got a handle on things, though, and the story was an enjoyable experience until close to the end. The ending itself was quick and unexpected, and there were still a few loose ends that hadn't been tied up. Like, why was the Terminator trying to destroy the world? And why was Rasputin going along with it?

Because it's awesome and it will help you better understand the story of this game. Once again you are playing Esther and you've been tasked with saving the future! Micheal, from the first game, returns and it's finally time to deal with the world changing catastrophe that was mentioned in the first game. You also have to save Viviana, the villain from the second game. This game has a lot of time line changing in it to fix everything and create a happy ending.\n\nGame play is standard hidden object flare. Lots of hidden object scenes and lots of fun mini games plus achievements to collect. The artwork is stunning and it's fully voice acted, Michael getting a huge upgrade from the first game. The portable time travel device is back, making everything easier and with more places to visit.\n\nThis game ties back to the first game the most, actually acknowledging it happened and what I was looking for from this series. It brings everything full circle and gives the characters a happy ending. Great game play, more exciting Ambrose adventures and a great story; this game gets my full recommendation.\n\nLunar Productions[lunarproductions.tumblr.com]","August 17, 2015","true","3.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","1"

The gameplay is quite fun, as it is in most of their games, but something that surprised me is how interesting the story turned out to be. Usually in these games the story is not a strong selling point, and especially not in this game's predecessor, "Time Mysteries: The Ancient Spectres". The story in that game is horrible, so I was pleasantly surprised to find that the sequel managed to do a better job in that department.\nI do however advise against playing this game if you haven't played the predecessor "The Ancient Spectres", as it would detract from the enjoyment. So either play that one beforehand or don't play this one at all, since a big part of what this game managed to do right is in allusion to the previous title in the series .\nSo yeah, that's my advice.","February 9, 2015","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's presumably one of their more dated projects, and it shows. Not only is the game short (I beat it in 2 hours, including the bonus story, though I'll confess to skipping two or three puzzles in addition to about two-thirds of the cinematics), but it's just a little clumsier than what I'm used to seeing from them. The hidden object segments are hit and miss, but mostly miss thanks to lower-res images and a tendency to hide the most identifiable part(s) of some objects so that you can't even tell what they're supposed to be when you're looking straight at them. (An inevitable few confusing labels - "handle" for a knob, e.g. - are old hat, but still annoying when they happen.) The usual nonsensical "keys" and progression items are at play, which is forgivable but not ideal, and it definitely has one of the weakest and least well-integrated plotlines in the library. My biggest gripe, though, is that this game only offers two difficulty options, basically divided into a kiddie mode that holds your hand constantly (this is what I settled on, contributing to the brevity of the playthrough) and an exasperating mode that forces you to find and remember every detail of the often unintuitive environments if you wish to progress.\n\nThat said, the successful AM formula - a good balance of puzzles and hidden object scenes, nice visuals accompanied by good voice acting, etc. - manages to keep the overall experience positive.","November 8, 2015","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is amazing how far the developer has come in the process of making this series. Yes, there are better games from Artifex Mundi, but most of them are younger showing the constant willingness to learn and evolve.\n\nThe art is absolutely beautiful and a few of the backgrounds can be downloaded as wallpapers, which is a nice bonus. The writing is much better than the previos games, but does here and there still stumble over standard Time Travel tropes. The writing department is one that can still get better. Often I have the impression they need to get braver, take more risks as to not be so forseeable. The music is atmospheric and fitting. The minigames still have no descriptions but are much more intuitively designed.\n\nThe whole trilogy felt like a journey through time and evolution of Artifex Mundi as developers. Very interesting.

So the story by itself might not mean much of you haven't played the second one. But it is much more engaging than the first two of the series.

Got it from a bundle. Interesting storyline, about magic, Merlin, Orwell's 1984, and other weird elements that tie in together in a time travel adventure. I will definately try other similar titles.\n\n+ Different approach on a classic HOG\n+ Puzzles and mini-games\n+ Read between the lines facts\n+ Interesting real life inspired elements\n+ Easy Achievements\n+ Trading Cards (Emotes/Backgrounds)\n- Short\n\n\nPersonal Ranking: 5/10","March 12, 2015","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is amazing how far the developer has come in the process of making this series. Yes, there are better games from Artifex Mundi, but most of them are younger showing the constant willingness to learn and evolve.\n\nThe art is absolutely beautiful and a few of the backgrounds can be downloaded as wallpapers, which is a nice bonus. The writing is much better than the previos games, but does here and there still stumble over standard Time Travel tropes. The writing department is one that can still get better. Often I have the impression they need to get braver, take more risks as to not be so forseeable. The music is atmospheric and fitting. The minigames still have no descriptions but are much more intuitively designed.\n\nThe whole trilogy felt like a journey through time and evolution of Artifex Mundi as developers. Very interesting. I am sure they will grow and learn even more because they are clearly trying to be the best they can be.","February 21","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While the first one was awful, the second and this one completely make up for it in their incredible illustrations, unpredictable plot line, and great mini-games.","May 18","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
