Reaching certain Lum targets can earn extra "Electoons", which unlock new levels and characters.\nBesides of jumping Rayman learns new skills such as hovering, swimming and shrinking, bringing a compelling variety to the action, and testing your dexterity to the limits.\nOn your way you have to cross floating platforms, dissolving platforms, platforms that twist and turn, that bounce you into the air or slowly fall and fade.\nRayman: Origins has impressive graphics, the backgrounds are beautifully drawn and has multiple layers of action.\nThe levels vary from familiar takes on platforming staples – cloud levels and underwater levels – to such oddities as a world based on didgeridoos.\nAlongside the standard platforming levels, there are boss encounters, and scrolling shoot-'em-up challenges in which you leap on to a mosquito and fly through formations of angry birds and spiky puffer fish.\nRayman Origins features drop-in/drop-out cooperative play for up to four players at a time and as long as one of you stays alive to free injured players from bubbles in which they become trapped when hit, progress through a level remains possible.\nEverywhere there is humour and whimsy, every screen a feast of bizarre scenery and weird inhabitants.\nRayman: Origins is one of the best platforming experiences you are going to have on Steam.

But their snoring disturbs an old granny from the Land of the Livid Dead. She sends out an army of Darktoons across the Glade of Dreams, who capture the Electoons which inhabit it. You, as Rayman and his friends, must go out across the world and free the Electoons to restore the Glade.\n\nAlthough the story is great, the game's aesthetics and soundtrack is where it really shines. The beautifully crafted world, accompanied by the brilliant musical score, is what really sucked me in. The visuals are absolutely gorgeous, and the soundtrack is superb.\n\nGameplay is excellent too. The animations are fab, and the game overall feels very fluid. I am not a huge fan of platformers, the gameplay usually fails to entertain me, but I absolutely adored Origins. You start off with just the ability to run. But as you progress you unlock more abilities, such as wall-running. There are also certain levels in which you ride a mosquito. You can either shoot enemies or suck them up to fire them.\n\nThe game comes with 4-player local co-op. This is great, but it would be even better if it included Online play too. This is the only downside to the game.\n\nOne of the best PC games to be released in 2012. I recommend this to both those who adore platformers, and those who do not.","March 21, 2014","true","20.8"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FrizSteam/recommended/207490/","FrizSteam","Friz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FrizSteam/","203 products in account","One of the best platformers I have ever played. The Donkey Kong Country series was the one I always considered the best, until I tried this one. The main thing I like about this game, is that you move at a much faster pace, compared to something like the DKC games. There are optional challenge levels that will test just how good you are at controlling your character at its max speed. If you can complete those, you earn the right to play the Land of the Livid Dead level, which is the most challenging stage in the game.\n\nAll the secret/bonus rooms in a stage, have their own unique platforming segments that you must get past, in order to get the reward from it. I enjoy that a lot more than how the DKC bonus/secret areas usually are (just collecting the bananas). The boss fights are also a lot more difficult and better designed. The art and animations make the boss fights look so good and those water stages also.\n\nThe difficulty is also great. Nothing is cheap and unfair. Everything stays the same for a stage and you will never feel like it was the stage's fault for dieing, but your own. The game also has fast respawns for when you die and automatic checkpoints per stage. You will never have to start back at the beginning of the stage (unless you die there) and you will get to keep everything you have collected so far.\n\nThe game will last you 10+ hours, if you plan on trying to unlock all the levels. If you like this game, then check out Rayman Legends, which I think is even better.","April 16, 2014","true","9.5"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/arbco/recommended/207490/","arbco","Alien Rope Burn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/arbco/","761 products in account","It's hard not be charmed by Rayman Origins. It has a sort of party atmosphere, with its bright colors, upbeat music, and surreal shenanigans that keep it charming almost all the way. Almost. The graphics are probably some of the sharpest 2d environments seen in a platformer, with a bizarre cartoony look that's not like much else.\n\nAt its heart, Rayman is a collecting platformer, where you try and collect thingies (lums) to free thingies (electoons), though there's a secondary thingie (skull teeth) you can collect in special challenge levels to unlock another thingie (an extra hard series of stages). As such, if you want to hit every note, you'll be repeating stages to make a better time or to collect more thingies, and your opinion on that may very. Overall, though, you don't have to sweat that too much, and those that can put their collection impulses on hold can charge through the game for the most part.\n\nWith a variety of moves and skills to unlock, most of the levels become a breezy delight, hovering, running up walls, bouncing off of enemies, etc. In my opinion, it comes very close to dethroning the kings of platforming, save for two issues: the levels can be long, and towards the latter half the game can lean towards being surprisingly tough. Seperately neither of these would be an issue, but together they can deal out some real frustration towards the end of the game. The long levels mean it can lean on being repetitive within a larger world, but each world is varied and often come up with some really great gimmicks, floating through updrafts or sliding down waterfalls. (Note to the developers, though: ice levels where you slide everywhere are not fun.) Annoyingly, the game has a tendency to ask you if you want to switch levels if you die too many times, which it will do over and over - some of the final levels had that pop up occur six or seven times, and when you're just trying to progress, it's rather irritating. An option to turn that reminder off would have been pretty welcome. Contrary to that, though the challenge levels can be similarly tough, their short length and breakneck pace thankfully turn them into one of the highlights of the game. At its best, the game has you charging through areas in a fashion you'd expect of a AAA theme park game, while at no point holding your hand.\n\nUltimately, though, whether you just get a taste or collect every bit, Origins is worth your time. If you can affort Legends, it's a better game that mitigates many of Origins' flaws, but since Origins is often available for just a few bucks during the seasonal sales, it's absolutely worth it. For those with a distaste for UPlay, you can also relax in the fact Origins doesn't use it at all. It's a rare "pure" sort of game from a big developer, with no DLC shenanigans or anti-piracy measures. (This may also be due to the fact it got a government grant for its development...)\n\nGive it a shot, you should at least get a smile out of it.","August 8, 2015","true","17.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

The graphics, music and level designs range from good to amazing, that alone makes it well worth playing, but... (There's always a but.) The controls and boss designs leave much to be desired. Bosses move in completely fixed patterns that are pretty unforgiving and extremely boring once you know the patterns. In other words, bosses are trial and error until you've learned the patterns. That gets tedious real fast --- especially so on the final boss, where the bad controls and poor boss design clash in such a way that it's actually possible to go too fast and die because of that, which seems counter-intuitive when you're chasing the bad guy. The same thing goes for a few other levels, where you can build up enough momentum that the game can't keep up, which is extremely sad to have happen in a platformer. And then there are the controls that don't really feel tight enough for many situations that you are put in. Constantly I caught myself thinking "this wouldn't be a problem if it was Super Meat Boy or Mega Man". It's not that the controls are downright bad, they're just not good enough.\n\nIf you can overlook the flaws, it's a very good and extremely entertaining game.","July 7, 2014","true","13.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The asthetic of the game is striking to say the least and it is impossible to mistake for another game. Brown and grey are simply not colors that exist in this worlds pallet and it makes everything feel bright and alive. For the proper enjoyment I would abandon the "gotta go fast" mentality that plagues many fans of the genre, and take a slightly slower pace to enjoy the lovely atmosphere and music. Also avoid the power ups that double your electoon count unless you really like listening to the same 12 note song every 20 seconds of game play.\n\nTo put it simply: It is a nice game with a nice pace that doesn't outstay its welcome with an undersated soundtrack and visual design.","June 25, 2014","true","3.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Haruka_Tavares/recommended/207490/","Haruka_Tavares","Haruka","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Haruka_Tavares/","50 products in account","My review will be divided in two parts: in an opinion as a gamer and in an opinion as a fan of Rayman.\n\nAs a gamer, it is definitely a game worthy of the prizes that received back in 2011 by several identities including BAFTA, as "Best Platformer" and "Best Art Direction". It features more than twenty hours of longevity thanks to its 60+ levels, full of detail thanks to the wonderful job of the artists at Montpellier. It is a breeze of fresh air in the market of platforming games as an alternative to Mario, Sonic, etc. This game also supports cooperative gameplay. Chances are low that you will regret purchasing this, just check by yourself by playing the free demo!\n\nAs a Rayman fan, I honestly think the game had many potential to be better. The game suffered significant changes during the development, ending up in something that wasn't quite "promised" back in the E3 of 2010. Keep in mind: "Origins" for the 2D side-scrolling gameplay (like Rayman 1), not "Origins" for the backstory of the most important characters. Don't expect the existence (and especially a coherent) of a story, since this pretty much lacks it. The levels are too linear and easy to overcome  especially if you have a sharp dexterity from Rayman 1. While the artwork is impressive, I think the artists were chosen bad for the background treatment, with just one or two exceptions. For me it is the least good Rayman title out of the four currenty existent, and after finishing it you won't wish to replay it very soon. In short, it is a good game but not as fantastic as the other main titles released before.\n\n","August 9, 2013","true","13.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

I sometimes found myself repeating one little section of a level a dozen times until I started to get aggravated and cursed at the screen... but It happended rarely and because of a lack of concentration mostly!\n\nEvery level can be completed by just making it through, or by collecting a certain number of collectibles to get the maximum number of medals for that level.\nOne can also try to beat a certain time to get a speed run medal which is asking for precision platforming.\nThen there are the crazy treasure chest runs which are levels in which you chase a treasure chest and have to be as fast as possible.\nThese levels require a lot of practice and trial and error progression which could bother many, I liked them and found myself more frustrated with some of the standard levels and bosses... but that might be a question of individual taste.\n\nI beat the game in around 11 hours and it will give you at least 15 to 20 hours of gameplay if you target 100% completion.\nI personally felt the game was a little too long, halfway through when you think you have completed the game, 4 new worlds pop up with a boss in each of them, these bosses are mainly fun but can get a little frustrating sometimes because of trial and error pattern learning on the players part.\nThe leveldesign got better the further you progress in the game, I felt, but still it seemed a little stretched for my taste and schedule but most people would probably disagree.\n\nConclusion\nIf you like challenging platformers and the Rayman art style you will definitely enjoy this game a lot!\nIt’s not on par of course with SMW. It’s not on par with Super Meat Boy although that is a bad comparison for many reasons.\nBut it’s certainly the best platformer I played since Super Meat Boy and I will definitely play through the follow up Rayman Legends when I get the chance.\nLast but not least, the game supports up to 4 player local co-op which is really fun!\nI would recommend this game (I even gifted my little niece a copy for her 3DS last christmas, so there you go)!\n","March 14, 2015","true","12.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are a decent amount of levels that gradually ramp up in difficulty and can be approached in a linear fashion until the mid point of the game where you can jump between multiple new areas. Some of the later levels were quite frustrating and the last few had me almost pulling my hair out. Also the bosses can be very trial-and-error meaning you will just die a lot until you figure out safe spots to run rayman over to until the weak point is revealed. Still, if you're a fan of the genre you'll probably like this one although I hear Legends has 40 of the levels from origins so it may be better to get that one instead.","June 17, 2015","true","14.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I sometimes found myself repeating one little section of a level a dozen times until I started to get aggravated and cursed at the screen... but It happended rarely and because of a lack of concentration mostly!\n\nEvery level can be completed by just making it through, or by collecting a certain number of collectibles to get the maximum number of medals for that level.\nOne can also try to beat a certain time to get a speed run medal which is asking for precision platforming.\nThen there are the crazy treasure chest runs which are levels in which you chase a treasure chest and have to be as fast as possible.\nThese levels require a lot of practice and trial and error progression which could bother many, I liked them and found myself more frustrated with some of the standard levels and bosses... but that might be a question of individual taste.\n\nI beat the game in around 11 hours and it will give you at least 15 to 20 hours of gameplay if you target 100% completion.\nI personally felt the game was a little too long, halfway through when you think you have completed the game, 4 new worlds pop up with a boss in each of them, these bosses are mainly fun but can get a little frustrating sometimes because of trial and error pattern learning on the players part.\nThe leveldesign got better the further you progress in the game, I felt, but still it seemed a little stretched for my taste and schedule but most people would probably disagree.\n\nConclusion\nIf you like challenging platformers and the Rayman art style you will definitely enjoy this game a lot!\nIt’s not on par of course with SMW. It’s not on par with Super Meat Boy although that is a bad comparison for many reasons.\nBut it’s certainly the best platformer I played since Super Meat Boy and I will definitely play through the follow up Rayman Legends when I get the chance.\nLast but not least, the game supports up to 4 player local co-op which is really fun!\nI would recommend this game (I even gifted my little niece a copy for her 3DS last christmas, so there you go)!\n","March 14, 2015","true","12.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can't call yourself a gamer if you have never played a Rayman game before. There's nothing more to say really. It's a platformer, with unlockable abilities and bossfights. But the bossfights... oh boy, remember Super Meat Boy ? Even Rayman Origins has several frustrating levels... and boss fights. It's the one thing that really annoyed me and took away a lot of fun at the same time. The boss fights require a certain pattern if you want to kill them. It will DEFINITELY take you a couple of tries for every boss fight there is. It's annoying and requires no skill whatsoever; just a good memory.\nThankfully the HD graphics make up for it... in a way.\n\n[Rating: 85/100]","May 3, 2012","true","7.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Why? Read this test to learn more!\n\nFirst of all I want to talk about the atmosphere. You play in different worlds and their "Dark" World types. The worlds are completly different (Forrest, African, I won't spoiler more...) and have their own music and graphics. You see  Dust flying up in the African styled maps and after a time this even becomes a part of the Gameplay!\nThe Graphics are just awesome. Hand-made worlds create a feeling of really being in the Rayman World. Together with the fitting sounds and music, this creates a very good atmosphere.\nAlso: When I played the first levels of Rayman, it made me really happy. I played and was happy. I even had to stop myself from playing too much, because I did not want Rayman's adventure to go over too fast!\n\nNow to the Fairness and sticked with that: The Controls.\nThe Controls are intuitive and easy-to-learn. After some times, you get new abilities, which though do not make the game confusing. You understand them and they stay in your brain.\nThe game is pretty easy if you just want to play it through. You just have to get through the levels with the (sometimes not so many) checkpoints. But if you want a challenge, ok: Collect over 300, or even 350 points in the level, complete it with the best time possible or even find all of the hidden emoticons!\nAnyways, sometimes the not so good spreaded checkpoints are a little annoying or the unlimate pro times in the time challengers mode. You have to complete the level in a certain time (may sometimes even be 3 minutes!) AND not die AND be as fast as somehow possible. This is sometimes annoying, but I mean: it is optional, so...\n\nI already talked about the Gameplay a bit: Different worlds, different challenges, new abilities, time trial,...\nThe most fun though is exploring the level. If you just up in the "wrong" way that you should and then do a bit of this and that...Hey! There is a mini game for an emoticon! And if you try to just go under the collapsing bridge...50 points in a coin! Nice done, Ubisoft!\nAlso, you unlock new characters and racing levels with the emoticons. The characters are just for the optics, but the races are really fun! With the pursuit soundtrack you run behind a running Chest around a collapsing level, split up, come to him again, etc etc. It is just like a much better time trial mode!\n\nAnyways, the Longness is not so long if you just play the game through without secrets, time trials and so on. You can be through in 7 hours. If you do the time trials and the other stuff, Rayman can take like 25 hours. This is up to you. For this huge difference there is a minus in the points rating though...\nThe Multiplayer is the only thing I would critise in the game: You may play local Co Op, but there are no Local Co Op levels, and in a time in which everything is connected to the Internet, an Internet Multiplayer is actually a must-have...\n\nTL;DR: If you want to play a platformer which makes you happy while exploring wonderful levels with atmospheric music, you should buy this game! Just if you need a Multiplayer at all costs though, you should think about getting the game.","December 21, 2013","true","16.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It is nonsensical if the hitbox of the character reactivates after half a second, so you have no time to understand how to save the situation.\n\n3) Hitboxes of the character, enemies and dangerous environment is not clever at all.\nThere are tentacles that hit you far under the bottom of the drawing and far under the upper; thunders that have a giant invisible hitbox; enemies that I still don't know how far to hit them.\nDrawings are very pleasant to see but deceive you from their true collision box.\n\n4) The controls and the physics are not good for a platformer game:\nMaybe, here it'd be appropriate a "last but not least".\nNow, I know that lots of people agree that controls are very good and movement are precise and the overall physics is cool.\nI think here, maybe, is just a matter of opinion, but at least I want to give a reason to my opinion.\nMovement is super smooth, even when not on ice, even when you are in the middle air, and this makes it very imprecise when jumping on platforms.\nRunning movement is ambiguous: you can start fast and get your movement even more slippery especially in the middle air when you have no more chances to strike a floating platform.\nJumping is decided by the time you press the button, but it has only two values, a high jump and a not-so-short jump, that does not give you the possibility to jump quickly between platforms while running.\nWhen becoming tiny, all the physic changes and gives you a very hard time: lateral attacks are always charged, jumps are even more not precise and you are like constantly on ice.\nGliding with you hairs almost instantly cut down your speed to a constant value, that you can adjust but still with slippery controls. Also, you can't instantly reactivate the gliding, making the flying parts very painful.\nRunning on curved walls seemed a cool feature, but there are too many parts in wich you must jump to another wall and continue running. I never understood that system as more of half of the times the character started falling down or going backward (on upside-down running).\n\nWithout any doubt, this has been one of the most slippery platformers I've ever played since years and those 4 points are why the game should have deserved a bad vote.\nAnyway, the work with graphics, music, humor and cuteness saves this game.\n\nAnd now, let's install Rayman Legends\n\n\nUpdate:\nI'm playing Rayman Legends and it's absolutely 100 times better than Origins!\nAll the negative aspects of this title are wiped away, collectibles are fun to take and movements are very precise.","July 10, 2015","true","10.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Saleck/recommended/207490/","Saleck","Saleck","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Saleck/","650 products in account","Rayman has been around since the mid 1990s but the rapid success of the spin-off Raving Rabbids had left the main character behind and stuck in the background. But then one day, original creator Michel Ancel decided to bring the character to give the team a break from developing Beyond Good and Evil 2.\n\nThe return of the character as well as its return to its platforming roots has been very much celebrated. This is probably as good as platformers are ever going to get. The game has a fun, cartoony look and atmosphere to it, it doesn't take itself seriously at all and it completely blows away anything Sonic and Mario have done over the last 10 years.\n\nThe difficulty is spot on, no lives system here you just keep going, with checkpoints that are places so the game remains challenging without being frustrating, you'll never be wasting more then a minute of your time getting back to the point where you messed up.\n\nThe level environments and music are so well created its surreal. You can revisit any level you want to play from the game menu and the flow of the levels are so smooth. The game is long too, expect it to take a good 10 hours to get through, if you pace yourself.\n\nHighly recommended if you love great platforming, wacky fun humour and a great art style to fit it all together with.

Sadly, the game is meant for kids below the ages of 12. This is not a negative per se but I find that I am unable to appreciate the prepubescent cuteness. I loved the idea of the extra levels, each level is revisited again to find the King of the land. However, I would call this a non-priority game. Why? There is no excitement that constantly makes me want to keep on playing. I use this more as a filler game when I'm free.\n\nPROS\n1. Hidden Levels\nLots of them to find. They aren't hard to find but it's worth looking for.\n\n2. Mini Games\nThe mosquito level was very interesting. Being able to fly a mosquito with a vacuum proboscis was fun.\n\n3. Pig Latin\nI didn't see it at first, but then I saw that the language used was Pig Latin or Ig-Pay Atin-Lay.\n\n4. Revisiting\nIt's nice to see that they place another set of levels on top of the original set, so you basically get 2 separate copies of the same zone. 1 easy mode and 1 hard mode.\n\nCONS\n1. Hard to keep my attention for long\nI don't know how to put it, I wanted to play the game a bit at a time.\n\n2.

Basically, what I thought was this:\n\n- Music and graphics are really, really amazing! Top-notch stuff, really.\n- But everything else is meh or bad. Gameplay is so boring, really repetitive, and the game is insanely easy. Infinite lives? C'mon... There are only 2 challenges in the game (getting gold medals for colleting enough fireflies, or whatever they're called, and the trophy for time trial), but even those aren't too hard.\n- I haven't tried co-op mode, but I think it would be even easier.\n\nSo basically it's a bland game that relies solely on a trademark and on aesthetics.\n\nBut, wait, it gets worse!\nAfter playing for about 8 hours, mastering 3 worlds, the game crashed (not for the first time) and that crash affected my savefile! So, basically, I lost all my progress.\nAnd you know what? This has been a known bug FOR OVER 2 YEARS, and not the only game-breaking bug I've found in the forums.\nFrom Steam Support's page for the game, I get a link for an official website that doesn't exist anymore, and a link to a support center that offers no support for this game. (and I'm currently requesting a refund for this game, because I've paid for a complete game).\n\nI think that this game should be removed from Steam, or at least feature a big label, saying "THIS GAME IS A BROKEN AND ABANDONED BY UBISOFT! BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK!"\nWhat annoys me the most is that this is a game from a big franchise in a big company. There should be no excuse for such huge mistakes.\n\nAnd what really, really puzzles me is how can it have 956 positive reviews as of now, totalling 95% of the reviews. This game is mediocre at best without the game-breaking bugs, and doesn't even get close to living up to its franchise name, so DON'T BE FOOLED BY ITS COVER and avoid it entirely.\n\n(Also, as I protest, I refuse to even give Legends a try.)\n\nEDIT: To top it off, after a long series of annoying Ubisoft support (in which they repeatedly tell me to run an antivirus), they tell me they can't make the proper tests because THEY HAVE NO ACCESS TO THE GAME!!!","December 27, 2015","false","8.3"," 24 of 53 people (45%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","45","24","53","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ksempac/recommended/207490/","ksempac","Ksempac","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ksempac/","303 products in account","It's a Rayman game (I loved the first one on PS1), it's often good, sometimes great... so why I am so bored when I play it ?\n\nTwo expressions come to my mind to try to get to describe the feelings i have regarding this game: "Soulless" and "Paint-by-numbers".\n\nMany of the levels feel empty. You go from platform to platform, you meet some enemies, but most of them are immobile, or even sleeping. They don't feel like enemies at all, they are not here to hunt you, they don't care about you at all. They completely lack personality. Good platformers have enemies that have an interesting behavior that give them personality. Even Goombas in Mario are memorable with their mean looking eyes. In Rayman, in many cases, that's not the case. It's so bad that sometimes it's hard to tell if something is here to help you or kill you (i made a few mistakes that way).\n\nStory-wise it's the same. It's full of holes. After a hilarious 5 min cartoon intro, the game tells you "ok you have to fetch electoons again. Go for it". It's almost like there is no relation to what you just saw with what you have to do. Most of the characters you will meet have no name, and will usually don't utter more than one sentence. Sometimes it feels like there are 2 distinct stories and none of them was completed.\n\nThat's really disappointing, because technically the game is top notch, with colorful environments and very nice animations. And sometimes, the Rayman's magic is back. In a few levels, (particularly the water world levels), enemies actually have personality, the environments are full of life, and the music nicely complement the action.\n\nNowadays AAA studios have mostly abandoned platformers to the indie scene. So i was happy to get a new Rayman from a big Ubisoft studio. I suspect many of you feel the same.\n\nHowever, I can't forget nor forgive the fact that, after 2 or 3 levels, i usually quit the game because i was bored. Worse, i also used the "skip level" functionality several times when i didn't feel like completing that level right away. That's not things i would get in a good game. I did finish the game, including the awesome bonus level (by far, the best level, and really enjoyable), but i really had to force myself to play many of the levels (particularly the wind world).\n\nSadly, there are too many boring levels where I'm just going through the motions. "Been there, done that", was a recurring feeling. Most levels felt like the 1000th iteration on the same stuff from countless platformers. There are too few memorable/good levels for me to recommend this game.\n\nMaybe some of the problems come from the added multiplayer. I only played the game solo, and i guess with friends, it would get more chaotic, but also more fun. Maybe that would alleviate some of the issues i had with the game. It would explain why the levels sometimes feel empty and the enemies are too passive: with 4 players it must already be very hard to get to the end with everyone. But I'm unable to test that theory.\n\nPS : For achievements hunters, be warned that the game doesn't include Steam achievements, even though the console versions have them.\n\nPS2 : Regarding difficulty. Some reviewers state that this game is the toughest game they've ever seen. That's not my opinion. 2D Platformers have often been challenging games. Considering that fact, i think that Origins is not easy, but it's not hard either.\n\nIf you just want to see the end, as well as unlock the bonus level, Rayman Origins is way easier than many platformers from the 90s, like the SNES platformers, or Rayman 1 on PS1. It's also way easier than some modern titles like Super Meat Boy. If you're familiar with platformers, you should be able to finish it without issue.\n\nTime trials are probably trickier, but i wasn't interested in trying them so i can't give you my opinion on them.","January 18, 2015","false","21.3"," 14 of 34 people (41%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","41","14","34","0","8"

Then there are tight and responsive controls which should make a enjoyable platformer, but Rayman Origins lacks something that makes you want to see the next stage.\nAfter three hours it seems that you've already seen everything and you will go through the same kind of levels in different scenarios again.\nFirst platforming, then mosquito flying and in the end you will get a new skill. And when you have enough collectables you will go back to earlier worlds to race a treasure chest.\nWhen I finally cleared all worlds and thought I was going to face the boss the game opened more passages to extended stages of the prior worlds.\nAnd again I went through the same procedure again. Jumping, Flying and rescuing nymphs for the final assault.\nOverall it was very repetitive (gameplay, animation, screen and the end of every stage) and I literally was so bored that I almost didn't finish the game.\nThen there were some bugs that didn't make the game scroll to the new area when I went through portals or doors. The only solution was to restart the whole level again.\nBecause the game becomes very challenging in the end ('Super Meat Boy'-esque),  this can be very frustrating and makes it definitely not a game for kids, although it's artdesign\nand it's humor, which didn't really get me, makes you think so.\n\nI really wanted to play Rayman Legends afterwards but my experience really made me reconsider.\n\nUnfortunally It's not a Mario or a DKCR (obviously the game's original) for PC ...\n\n6/10\n\nPS: The last levels were cool though ...","January 24, 2014","false","11.7"," 23 of 55 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","23","55","0","1"

It could be a combination of a few things: the music is not great (simple beats, but nothing moving, or interesting to hear), the character animations are good, but get old quickly.

A few mechanics beyond running, jumping and attacking are unlocked as you progress - swimming , wall running, flying - however they're mostly only used in the world that you unlocked them in.\n\nThe combat is very simple, most enemies die in one hit, apart from the bosses which have some originality, but like much of the harder portions of the game, the bosses just need lots of repetition to get muscle memory and knowledge of attack patterns.\n\nEach level has a few "electoons", which are mostly quite easy to acquire. The fun part in getting these is in the little challenge each section presents, but due to limited game mechanics, I can't remember any distinct ones.\n\nThe hard parts, such as bosses and the levels where you chase a treasure chest for a secret *thing*, are like quick time events without the visual cues - and if you're just a moment off even though you made a good recovery, the design of the game forces you to play again, getting a microsecond closer to the speed they want you to get to.\n\nThe visuals are quite nice, but you only notice them in the calm before the storm because otherwise you're too busy running around or trying to not die, which is a shame.\n\nThe music was unique, but the loops caused by dying repeatedly mean that any nice melodies are quickly forgotten.\n\nThe sidescrolling shooter parts are fun and a good challenge, and there aren't too many, which means you can accept that they didn't give the separate costumes (oops, I mean characters) distinctive playstiles.\nAs far as I noticed, even in the walking part of the game, the different characters did nothing either, apart from help you identify you and your friends apart.\n\nWithout co-op I probably wouldn't enjoyed this game enough to bother going very far. Co-op mechanics were decent and allowed for coordination and teamwork, however guacamelee did it better - in fact, I think Guacamelee did everything better, apart from on incomparable things such as artstyle.\n\ntl;dr unless you're a big Rayman fan, play Guacamelee instead.","June 22, 2014","false","20.6"," 2 of 17 people (12%) found this review helpful","12","2","17","0","0"

Everything is too soft and sluggish. Attacks often interrupt flow rather than contribute and I frequently felt like I didn't have enough control of the character.\n\nThe difficulty also seems slightly mistuned. I think I'm pretty good at platformers (I have 100% in Super Meat Boy) and I found myself consistently missing the par for each course by only a few points. This makes replaying levels a tense affair as missing a single Lum can fill you with dread that its just cost you level's medal and you have to start the whole dreadful business over again.\n\nI got excited in my playthrough as I finished the final island - hoping that the game was nearing its end - when it was revealed that I then had to revist every location again to beat the game. As if this didn't crush my sprits enough, my hard drive crashed and I lost my save.

That part was REALLY hard. I even went online to find solutions and I tried all of them. I'm not going to spoil it for everyone, but it involves **SPOILER** making sure your controller is plugged in before starting **SPOILER**\n\nAnd I'm STILL stuck trying to configure my gamepay. Holy ♥♥♥♥ this is a tough game. I really like the design so far though, the EA into and the music is really jazzy, and I feel like if I get any further in the game I'm really going to have a blast, even more so than where I am right now.\n\nI guess if there's anything I'd fix with the game, it's that you can't seem to get it to recognize your XBox360 controller. I mean DANG, I'm not the only one with the problem, patch this already so we can keep playing, Ubisoft! ;)\n\nAll in all, I wouldn't recommend this game though. It's really short and so far all I've been able to do is enter the options and that's about it.\n\nI'm sure the rest of the game is great though, but it might be too hard for noobs like me. I mean, if I can't get any further than that, just two minutes into the game, I guess I'm going to have a really hard time in the later parts.\n\nAnyway that's it for my review. Oh, and here's some extra points:\n\nGraphics 4/5 - Crisp and really great, iconic design. Good intro animation.\nSound 4/5 - it gets repetitive after a while, and there only seems to be one song so far, but it's catchy!\nPlot 3/5 - The game's really got me stoked to find out what those little things flying into the EA symbol in the beginning are.\nControls 1/5 - While technically I haven't been able to play with my controller yet, the mouse can open menus really well!\nChallenge 5/5 - Only play this if you are a PRO! I mean it!\nOverall  3.5/5 - Hopefully there's going to be a LP that'll show me how to get past the control puzzle soon.","February 13, 2014","false","0.5"," 4 of 24 people (17%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","17","4","24","0","0"

I never bothered to buy this rather affordable title for years since it came out, and despite its popularity, I just didn't feel like getting it for some reason. Then one day, a sale came around, and as I was looking around for bargins, I came across this title for a nice little price. I was torn between a few other titles I wanted, but then I decided to get out of my comfort zone and try something I never was too interested in.\n\nTurns out it was worth it, even if it ticked me off near the end.\n\nIn an age full of mindless shooters, zombie surviver deathmatches, and "retro" games that hardly feel retro and more lazy in the art department, Rayman Origins is a game that shows us that you don't need any of that rubbish to be a good game. You can be a 2D platformer and still look good at the same time, and best of all, it has difficulty that scales with the levels, so the further you go, the harder things get. None of that so called "hardcore" platforming crap where they claim they designed the levels poorly intentionally.\n\nRanting aside, this truely is a nice return to form for Rayman, even if the story is rather confusing and the gameplay, while it starts out fun and simple at first, soon gets really hard and demanding as more mechanics come into play, sometimes to the point that you die over and over again at a single point of the game until you either master it or get lucky.. But thankfully, there are plenty of save points, so it at least reduces the frustration, even near the end of the game.\n\nNow, the game isn't perfect, sure. As I said earlier, sometimes you'll come across levels that'll kick you in the balls over and over again, turning your happy little mood into a mood of pure annoyance, if not rage due to the near-percise actions needed for some parts of the game (as one person noted, it is almost like a quick time event, but without the "Press x to not die" system in place). However, as ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off as I would get at these levels, I still powered through, and even if you couldn't, the game will allow you to skip some levels if they prove too hard for some players, which is a kind gesture I suppose, if sometimes insulting.\n\nIn short, while I don't recommend this to casual gamers, those looking for a real, honest challenge might find this a lovely title to invest in. And best of all, you can play with your friends, should you have any, which might make the game easier or harder, depending on if your friends are jerks or not.","December 12, 2014","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You may think its going to be a crappy console port, but suprising it is very well made and does not suffer from consolization at all.  Don't let the cartoony graphics fool you, this game is not a kiddy adventure that holds your hand and lets you win.  Some of the levels are rediculously hard and several times I was at controller throwing levels of frustration.  In terms of difficulty its right up there with the best platformers.  The music is great and the animation really drives the games humor which is suttle, and never takes itself to seriously.

This game isn't plagued by some of the annoying aspects of platformers like Mario.\n\nThere is no timer except during an optional (but highly recommended) second level run during which you try to achieve a time goal. The lack of a timer allows you to explore as much as you like without feeling pressured. Also, one of the most annoying things about Mario games is absent from Rayman -- collision detection between players. In Mario, you feel forced to stay clear of your co-op partner as much as possible because bumping into him or accidentally jumping on his head (or visa versa) usually sends you flying uncontrollably to your death. In Rayman, there is no collision between players except when the players choose to boost each other or intentionally slap each other. There are no "continues" in Rayman. You're not going to have to start the game over because you run out of them. If it takes you 10,000 lives to finish a level, then so be it.\n\nI had to restart several levels simply because I was laughing to hard to play. The game is downright hilarious, and the platforming is challenging without being irritating.\n\n10/10","March 20, 2014","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IanPK/recommended/207490/","IanPK","Ian PK","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IanPK/","93 products in account","Honestly, this is the best video game I have ever played.I first played Rayman Origins on the PlayStation 3, and it quickly won me over with its colorful and fun atmosphere, creative platforming, and above all, THINGS TO COLLECT!\n\nRayman Origins is a collect-a-thon 2D platformer, giving you multiple things to collect:\nLums, which amount to the "coins" of Rayman. These little creatures are typically dormant, but if you wake up a king Lum, all of the Lums in the level will begin to sing and each be worth 2 Lums, but only for a short time.\nElectoons, the "stars" of Rayman. These are collected by reaching certain criteria, which are simply completing the level, collecting 250 Lums in the level, collecting 300 Lums in the level, breaking 2 Electoon cages in the level and freeing the Electoons inside, and completing a time trial run of part of the level.\nSkull Teeth, giant red teeth that belong to the Grim Reaper. These are collected by completing a special stage, 1 in each stage of the game. The stages are unlocked by collecting a certain amount of Electoons. These stages test your reflexes as you chase a treasure chest containing a Skull Tooth. Once all 10 teeth are collected, access to a final hidden stage is granted.\nLum Medals and Time Trophies are not as important, but are granted for collecting 350 lums and completing the time trial in less than a certain, faster time required for the Electoon, respectively.\nThe collection in Rayman Origins is incredibly fun and rewarding, with constant indicators of how complete you are with your collection, most notably on your save file. I just can't play this game without getting everything!\n\nOf course, who would want to collect anything if there wasn't any fun platforming involved? Rayman Origins is one of the most creative platformers I've ever played, with multiple power-ups, underwater levels where you can actually swim, levels that involve you flying on the back of a mosquito, running on walls, flying up sandstorms, the list goes on. Everything in the game is fun to go through and puts a smile on my face, which brings me to the graphics.\n\nRayman Origins was the first game created with Ubisoft's own UbiArt engine, and my, is it gorgeous! Everything in the game is completely hand-drawn: Rayman, his friends, enemies, and especially environments. One of the reasons I bought this game again on Steam was just so I could sit close to my monitor and admire the backgrounds that much more! Everything in the game is happy and colorful, and being sad while playing this game is simply impossible.\n\nThe music is also fantastic; as fun and creative as the game it's in, and complements the levels beautifully.\n\nOne warning about this game, however: it does get frustratingly difficult later on. Thankfully, Rayman and his friends have infinite lives, so you can retry levels until you beat them! (or ragequit. Whichever comes first.)\n\nSpeaking of Rayman and his friends, one of the best parts of this game's experience is its local co-op. Grab 3 friends and you can embark on the entire game together, collecting Lums (and yes, there is a bit of competition involved in seeing who collects more Lums xD) and struggling through precise platforming while one of your friends keeps messing everyone up. It's loads of fun and the way I first experienced the game!\n\nFinally, Rayman Origins is a gem and a platformer that is not to be missed. Even $10 is a steal for what I honestly believe to be one of the best games ever created, so buy it now!\n\n--Ian PK","June 26, 2015","true","12.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Most levels are simple enough for a child to get through, yet only the most hardcore players will be able to collect enough Lums (the game's version of coins) to get medals in each level without a lot of deaths. But that's okay, because dying in this game is relatively painless. There are no lives to lose, and the game will place you in the beginning of the section you were in nearly instantly (possibly taking a cue from Super Meat Boy?)\n\nThe art is gorgeous, the animation is smooth, and it has good controller support.

No going back. If you miss it you pretty much have to start the entire level or section over again.

For this, we can all rejoice. As the name implies, Rayman Origins is a return to its roots.

Toss in the cartoonish look and feel, and you're looking at a lighthearted nostalgia trip. Didn't have a childhood? That's okay! Rayman Origins can help you get started. Get it on sale, though.

The older, darker Raymans are not to be seen in this colorful and joyful game. Rayman Origins is not a bad game, it's just not at all the same style as the old ones.\n\nPros : It is easy to play, you can choose your own character, the graphics are awesome and the music is so gorgeous it is near absurd.\n\nCons : There is not so many challegings levels to beat, 90% of them are quite easy.

I never bothered to buy this rather affordable title for years since it came out, and despite its popularity, I just didn't feel like getting it for some reason. Then one day, a sale came around, and as I was looking around for bargins, I came across this title for a nice little price. I was torn between a few other titles I wanted, but then I decided to get out of my comfort zone and try something I never was too interested in.\n\nTurns out it was worth it, even if it ticked me off near the end.\n\nIn an age full of mindless shooters, zombie surviver deathmatches, and "retro" games that hardly feel retro and more lazy in the art department, Rayman Origins is a game that shows us that you don't need any of that rubbish to be a good game. You can be a 2D platformer and still look good at the same time, and best of all, it has difficulty that scales with the levels, so the further you go, the harder things get. None of that so called "hardcore" platforming crap where they claim they designed the levels poorly intentionally.\n\nRanting aside, this truely is a nice return to form for Rayman, even if the story is rather confusing and the gameplay, while it starts out fun and simple at first, soon gets really hard and demanding as more mechanics come into play, sometimes to the point that you die over and over again at a single point of the game until you either master it or get lucky.. But thankfully, there are plenty of save points, so it at least reduces the frustration, even near the end of the game.\n\nNow, the game isn't perfect, sure. As I said earlier, sometimes you'll come across levels that'll kick you in the balls over and over again, turning your happy little mood into a mood of pure annoyance, if not rage due to the near-percise actions needed for some parts of the game (as one person noted, it is almost like a quick time event, but without the "Press x to not die" system in place). However, as ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off as I would get at these levels, I still powered through, and even if you couldn't, the game will allow you to skip some levels if they prove too hard for some players, which is a kind gesture I suppose, if sometimes insulting.\n\nIn short, while I don't recommend this to casual gamers, those looking for a real, honest challenge might find this a lovely title to invest in. And best of all, you can play with your friends, should you have any, which might make the game easier or harder, depending on if your friends are jerks or not.","December 12, 2014","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Smooth, challenging, and utterly worthwhile. Rayman Origins, unlike most of the games in the series, is in touch with its roots, and recovers the same qualities that made the original Rayman such an excellent game. On the other hand, it isn't trapped in the past - this is no mere nostalgia trip, but its own distinct thing with its own unique playstyle and art style.\nIt's not quite as expansive as the original Rayman, but still rewards exploration. and offers multiple objectives in a given level to make multiple playthroughs worthwhile.\nSkill-wise,it gets reasonably tricky in the later levels, approaching Super Meat Boy in terms of difficulty. The level design has an excellent sense of flow. It's also pretty imaginitive, and evokes the feel of the original game's setting without copying it.\nThe only criticism I have is that it feels very slightly unfinished in places - missing animations, boss fights that are a bit shorter than expected, a somewhat abrupt ending. Nothing that really hurts the game, one just feels that they could have given it another month or so of polish before release and it wouldn't have been a bad idea.\nIf you're looking for a platformer, this is an excellent choice!

It didn't take long for me to get hooked on this great game. Wonderful animations, artwork and music all come together to make this one of the best 2D platformers I have had the pleasure of playing. The Co-op is also fantastic in that it allows a seasoned gamer play with a 4 year old and not get held up, in fact, the co-op is set up in such a way that having an inexperienced gamer can still assist in progressing through the game.\n\nGraphics:\nGraphically the game is flawless running at full HD and it runs great even on my work laptop with Intel graphics. The animations are smooth, artwork is amazing and the controls are responsive and natural.\n\nSound:\nThe game has a great sound track and the sounds are interesting and varied.\n\nOverall the game is great, the only issue I have is with the steam overlay, it is best to disable it in the game properties. If you bring up the overlay in game it can cause a player to join and run to the left which can be a real pain.","January 24, 2014","true","26.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Very smooth and fluid, with gorgeous animation and design to the characters and environments.\n\n1 thing I dislike the most:\nThe shmup levels. Very cluttered, probably too much, and with no surefire way to keep your eyes on your charcter with multiple enemies and players all over the place. They are seemingly the longest type of level, and though they are by far the easiest the medals for (there's 3 for each level instead of the standard 6), I feel like there's not enough checkpoint spread throughout all that length.\n\n1 feature I would want added:\nSimply being able to switch costumes with a menu during the world map screen, instead of having to enter a costume/rest area, which you can't exit immediately. You have to go to the far end of the last room to get to the exit door. Can get people who change outfits regularly ever slightly so annoyed.\n\n1 feature I would want taken out:\nThe "coin collected" type medals. Makes completing every level with all medals tedious; I gave up after realizing I wasn't having fun. Replace with a "beat the level without dying" challenge or something; you'll still be restarting, just a whole lot less.\n\nWhat I want improved:\nThe Boss fights. A mixed bag, really. Some play fine, while others will have you die cheap deaths. There's one underwater boss (the best kind, am I right?) in particular I hate with a passion.\n\nFinger(s): 1 thumb up (and a half) out of 3\n"Pretty good.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/speedyspikes/recommended/207490/","speedyspikes","SpeedySpikes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/speedyspikes/","21 products in account","I've had Rayman Origins on the PlayStation 3 since it first came out, and it's given me hardly any disappointment. It's a fantastically fun game!\n\nThere's no need to complain about the lack of a story simply because this game is emulating the good ol' days where it was just about the gameplay and fun and not necessarily about the story.\n\nRayman Origins is a 2D platformer, and the control in this game is very smooth and responsive. The game boasts 60+ levels of awesomeness, and players get new powers from the nymphs as they go along. Yes, you have to win the power of punching and kicking. But that's a callback to the first game! And the third! The levels are differently themed. You will travel through jungles, oceans, mountains, frozen tundras, musical lands and even an infernal kitchen! The game is designed to be relatively easier to just get through, however the game does get a lot harder as you progress. Plus, the major challenge in the game comes from gathering the collectables. Electoons can be found in cages or won by collecting hundreds of Lums, which can be found scattered throughout the level, obtained from defeating enemies or finding Skull Coins. The Tricky Treasure levels provide the second-biggest challenge in the game, as they are frantic chase-the-chest levels where the stage pretty much falls apart even worse as you keep going, and you earn Skull Teeth from these. The boss fights are not as difficult as I expected them to be, but they still provide a good challenge. However, once you complete the game there are a few very interesting twists that I will not reveal. Play the game to find out. :P The hardest challenge, of course, comes from The Land of the Livid Dead, a level that is unlocked after gathering all 10 Skull Teeth.\n[EDIT: I have played this level, and GOSH DARN IT is it hard! I lost track of how many times I died just trying to complete one section of the stage, but it's a lot of fun, and worth it, too. :) ]\n\nBut it all gets a lot zanier and crazier if you bring some buddies along! Up to four players can play this game at the same time. I've only done co-op with one friend at a time (I only had 2 PS3 controllers), but even that gets nutsy after a little while. The players have free reign to slap each other without directly hurting each other (however that won't stop you from accidentally launching your buddy off the cliff or into a trap). I have, however, done a whole bunch of friend co-op in the game's sequel, Rayman Legends, and if that mayhem was any indication, you're gonna have a great time with this one!\n\nThe Windows/OS X port was done pretty well. The only gripe I have is that it doesn't appear to be optimized TOO well, as occasionally it will skip a frame or two. It's nothing terrible, but to me, it's noticeable.\n\nNow, people may want to draw parallels to Legends. Is it better? Well... To be honest, I found Legends to be a little too easy. Origins packs more of a challenge from what I could see, and, honestly, I kinda prefer the cartoony art over the more realistic rendering of Legends. And it had an anti-climatic ending that wasn't funny like this on--\nIn fact, screw it. This game is miles better than Rayman Legends. To be fair, Legends has more content, but something just feels...off about that game compared to this one. This game has lots of character, bright environments, upbeat and fantastic music and, well, the entire game is amazing!\n\nIf you love platformers and/or Rayman, GET THIS GAME. You will NOT be disappointed! As you can see, I had no problem buying another copy of this game, so even if you have this game on a console already, get it for Steam.","December 11, 2015","true","21.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Vibrant. Humorous. Brutal. Fun. Special. To me, that is what sums up "Rayman Origins" in the best way possible. In a time where platformers have stopped showing up as often as they did in the 90's, it's very refreshing to see and play this game. I only wonder why I did not purchase this game on it's initial release date in 2011. So, I may be late to experience the joy that is "Rayman Origins", but I can say that it is a good quality platformer. There seems to be arguments on where in the Rayman timeline this game takes place. It was originally planned as a prequel to the original Rayman PS1 game, but it was scrapped at the last minute in favor of a new "story" (if you can even call it that) and is now mostly viwed upon as a reboot to the original Rayman. There is no meat on the story at all; just a pile of bare bones. But, who plays a platformer for the story, anyways? Just look at Mario. The visuals are absolutely breathtaking! The colors are vibrant and the animation is as smooth as butter. It may be nice on the eyes, but don't let that fool you into thiking it's going to be an easy or friendly childs game. I would say that the vast majority of levels are set to an "average" difficulty, but there are some that are much more unforgiving. Timing, momentum, and precision are key to succeeding these difficult areas. If you don't gain enough speed, it could lead to failure. If you run and jump, you could miss your target completely and fall to your demise. Even pressing the "A" button to jump, or lightly tapping it for a short jump can make the difference in hopping around pointy shards. In a screen-scrolling section of the game, I went through the whole level perfectly and just one little thing messed me up completely. As I was sliding down a tunnel, the end collapsed ever so slightly just before I got to that section and bonked Rayman on the head, resulting in a restart of the whole annoying level. The solution? Pressing down on the analog stick to make Rayman slide on his belly so he won't bump his head. It's those small things that can make the difference, and you have have to be fast to react. Also, it never feels cheap; you are always in control of whatever happens. The feeling of accomplishment is very great; just as you have FINALLY succeeded on a level that you have died on over and over again. To make it a little more fair, co-op is an option and it is a blast! Co-op is not something that I am very fond of, but in this game it works very well. This game may have some of the best controls of any 2D sidescrolling platformer out there; they are top-notch, very reactive, and tight, which is a very good thing for this type of game. The music is pretty nice, too. Maybe not as atmospheric or trance-like as the Donkey Kong Country series, but very nice, funny, and relaxing all at once. The only complaint I have is that the structure of the game feels a bit inconsistent at times. Instead of the levels going from easy, easy, hard, harder; it can be more like hardest, then easiest, then hard, then easy. The same applies for boss fights. The challenge posed by these bosses holds little correlation to the sequence through which they're unlocked. You may complete an absolutely horrowing level, only to fight a more-than-easy boss. Other times, you will beat an extremely easy level only to be pitted against a very difficult boss. But, I guess this concludes my review. Rayman Origins is a game I recommend to fans of 2D platformers and players who LOVE a challenge! Absolutely anyone can pick up a controller and learn to play this game within minutes, but it takes patience to complete it!\n\nRATING - 8/10","September 2, 2015","true","13.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/speedyspikes/recommended/207490/","speedyspikes","SpeedySpikes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/speedyspikes/","21 products in account","I've had Rayman Origins on the PlayStation 3 since it first came out, and it's given me hardly any disappointment. It's a fantastically fun game!\n\nThere's no need to complain about the lack of a story simply because this game is emulating the good ol' days where it was just about the gameplay and fun and not necessarily about the story.\n\nRayman Origins is a 2D platformer, and the control in this game is very smooth and responsive. The game boasts 60+ levels of awesomeness, and players get new powers from the nymphs as they go along. Yes, you have to win the power of punching and kicking. But that's a callback to the first game! And the third! The levels are differently themed. You will travel through jungles, oceans, mountains, frozen tundras, musical lands and even an infernal kitchen! The game is designed to be relatively easier to just get through, however the game does get a lot harder as you progress. Plus, the major challenge in the game comes from gathering the collectables. Electoons can be found in cages or won by collecting hundreds of Lums, which can be found scattered throughout the level, obtained from defeating enemies or finding Skull Coins. The Tricky Treasure levels provide the second-biggest challenge in the game, as they are frantic chase-the-chest levels where the stage pretty much falls apart even worse as you keep going, and you earn Skull Teeth from these. The boss fights are not as difficult as I expected them to be, but they still provide a good challenge. However, once you complete the game there are a few very interesting twists that I will not reveal. Play the game to find out. :P The hardest challenge, of course, comes from The Land of the Livid Dead, a level that is unlocked after gathering all 10 Skull Teeth.\n[EDIT: I have played this level, and GOSH DARN IT is it hard! I lost track of how many times I died just trying to complete one section of the stage, but it's a lot of fun, and worth it, too. :) ]\n\nBut it all gets a lot zanier and crazier if you bring some buddies along! Up to four players can play this game at the same time. I've only done co-op with one friend at a time (I only had 2 PS3 controllers), but even that gets nutsy after a little while. The players have free reign to slap each other without directly hurting each other (however that won't stop you from accidentally launching your buddy off the cliff or into a trap). I have, however, done a whole bunch of friend co-op in the game's sequel, Rayman Legends, and if that mayhem was any indication, you're gonna have a great time with this one!\n\nThe Windows/OS X port was done pretty well. The only gripe I have is that it doesn't appear to be optimized TOO well, as occasionally it will skip a frame or two. It's nothing terrible, but to me, it's noticeable.\n\nNow, people may want to draw parallels to Legends. Is it better? Well... To be honest, I found Legends to be a little too easy. Origins packs more of a challenge from what I could see, and, honestly, I kinda prefer the cartoony art over the more realistic rendering of Legends. And it had an anti-climatic ending that wasn't funny like this on--\nIn fact, screw it. This game is miles better than Rayman Legends. To be fair, Legends has more content, but something just feels...off about that game compared to this one. This game has lots of character, bright environments, upbeat and fantastic music and, well, the entire game is amazing!\n\nIf you love platformers and/or Rayman, GET THIS GAME. You will NOT be disappointed! As you can see, I had no problem buying another copy of this game, so even if you have this game on a console already, get it for Steam.","December 11, 2015","true","21.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Fantastic graphics that ooze with charm, with a soundtrack to match them, Rayman's world feels rich and completely developed. The learning curve is rather fair too, and ends up being a devilish challenge that avoids rage quit with plentiful checkpoints.\n\nSuch a shame that despite perfect execution on the game part, there is literally no story here. Im not expecting something deep or meaningful, it's Rayman after all. But from the developer or Beyond good and evil, how hard would it have been to throw in a similar whimsical story that propels the action along. Would have been a perfect 10/10 if it had that, but as it stands a very solid 8/10.","December 22, 2015","true","14.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was pleasantly surprised! It is wonderfully made, keeping all my favorite things about the original game.\n- Fun graphics and little touches to the game.\n- Love being able to go back later and get everything I previously missed in levels\n- Great difficulty progression and options to go back and do "just for fun" levels when the later levels get hard and you feel like taking a break from them.\n\nDownside: I would have liked to have seen a better story progression and more of a back story at the start.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IanPK/recommended/207490/","IanPK","Ian PK","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IanPK/","93 products in account","Honestly, this is the best video game I have ever played.I first played Rayman Origins on the PlayStation 3, and it quickly won me over with its colorful and fun atmosphere, creative platforming, and above all, THINGS TO COLLECT!\n\nRayman Origins is a collect-a-thon 2D platformer, giving you multiple things to collect:\nLums, which amount to the "coins" of Rayman. These little creatures are typically dormant, but if you wake up a king Lum, all of the Lums in the level will begin to sing and each be worth 2 Lums, but only for a short time.\nElectoons, the "stars" of Rayman. These are collected by reaching certain criteria, which are simply completing the level, collecting 250 Lums in the level, collecting 300 Lums in the level, breaking 2 Electoon cages in the level and freeing the Electoons inside, and completing a time trial run of part of the level.\nSkull Teeth, giant red teeth that belong to the Grim Reaper. These are collected by completing a special stage, 1 in each stage of the game. The stages are unlocked by collecting a certain amount of Electoons. These stages test your reflexes as you chase a treasure chest containing a Skull Tooth. Once all 10 teeth are collected, access to a final hidden stage is granted.\nLum Medals and Time Trophies are not as important, but are granted for collecting 350 lums and completing the time trial in less than a certain, faster time required for the Electoon, respectively.\nThe collection in Rayman Origins is incredibly fun and rewarding, with constant indicators of how complete you are with your collection, most notably on your save file. I just can't play this game without getting everything!\n\nOf course, who would want to collect anything if there wasn't any fun platforming involved? Rayman Origins is one of the most creative platformers I've ever played, with multiple power-ups, underwater levels where you can actually swim, levels that involve you flying on the back of a mosquito, running on walls, flying up sandstorms, the list goes on. Everything in the game is fun to go through and puts a smile on my face, which brings me to the graphics.\n\nRayman Origins was the first game created with Ubisoft's own UbiArt engine, and my, is it gorgeous! Everything in the game is completely hand-drawn: Rayman, his friends, enemies, and especially environments. One of the reasons I bought this game again on Steam was just so I could sit close to my monitor and admire the backgrounds that much more! Everything in the game is happy and colorful, and being sad while playing this game is simply impossible.\n\nThe music is also fantastic; as fun and creative as the game it's in, and complements the levels beautifully.\n\nOne warning about this game, however: it does get frustratingly difficult later on. Thankfully, Rayman and his friends have infinite lives, so you can retry levels until you beat them! (or ragequit. Whichever comes first.)\n\nSpeaking of Rayman and his friends, one of the best parts of this game's experience is its local co-op. Grab 3 friends and you can embark on the entire game together, collecting Lums (and yes, there is a bit of competition involved in seeing who collects more Lums xD) and struggling through precise platforming while one of your friends keeps messing everyone up. It's loads of fun and the way I first experienced the game!\n\nFinally, Rayman Origins is a gem and a platformer that is not to be missed. Even $10 is a steal for what I honestly believe to be one of the best games ever created, so buy it now!\n\n--Ian PK","June 26, 2015","true","12.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can easily discover every secret in this game, as they're all very clearly hidden and far too frequent. The later levels and challenges while fun, kind of come down to memorization in the end. You can skillfully figure out the solutions to the difficult running segments, but sometimes it's a very annoying process. There are many specific things you have to do in this segments, and remembering all of it can be a little obnoxious. I personally think that it's better to make a game difficult without the requirement of trial and error, or level memorization. I don't know if this remains true, but my controllers would not work in this game in the past. Back when I played this game, I had to configure them using joytokey to get my controllers working.\n\nThat being said, this game forces you to think on your toes and act even faster. Music is great, the art is fantastic and I think it's far better than anything Ubisoft's development teams put out prior. If you're looking for a fun and mostly simple platformer that's just as fantastic solo as it is with friends, you should already own this game. What it lacks in complexity, storytelling and any discernible feelings other than enjoyment, it more than makes up for with it's core gameplay.","June 2","true","28.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
