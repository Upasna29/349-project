However, each match felt exactly the same and once I got the hang of fighting the 3 enemies at once this game had nothing left to offer. The outfits are nice but collecting them all is the closest thing to a goal this game has. If that is enough for you then you might enjoy this game but it wasn't enough for me so I can't recommend it to other people.\n\nI made a more in-depth review here if you want more details: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxDUASduM3U","June 3","false","2.3"," 121 of 132 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","121","132","2","5"
