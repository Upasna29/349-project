In my opinion these are still the best submarine simulation games I have played. They have the right mix of simulation and playability to give you the feel of being in crontrol of a sub without some of the minute details that make some sub sims unplayable. For instance, you don't need to worry about running aground and sinking when you are on the big map, though you do need to keep an eye on your fuel tank. These games date back to the early days of computer gaming. The first copy of Silent Service which I owned ran on a 5.25" floppy disk in one floppy drive with the DOS OS running from a similar floppy in the other floppydrive, for in those days hard drives were still unknown. Windows had not been invented yet and there was no such thing as a computer mouse. A lot has changed since those days, but these games are still very enjoyable if you are able to go through the learning process. There is no tutorial such as we know tutorials in modern games. Back in those days the operating manual was the tutorial and you learned the game by reading the manual and trial-and-error. For those who, like myself, played this game many years ago and remember it well, you can skip to the back of the manual and refresh your memory on the keyboard controls and be back stalking convoys with very little time practicing to refresh your skills. For those new to the game, it is well worth spending some time to look through the manual and at least skim some of the basics. A thorough read will give you some very useful information that will help you get up to speed faster once you begin play. I was not able to get the game manual link in Steam to work, but you will find .pdf files containing the English and German versions of the original game manuals in the installation directory once you have downloaded the game. On my PC running Windows 8.1 the path for the SS2 English game manual is "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Silent Service 2\Manual (English).pdf" Good hunting, Commander.","June 2, 2015","true","0.2"," 32 of 35 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","32","35","3","0"

It's the original game exactly as it was. You'd have to be blind to buy this thinking it was anything else. Also, as it's on DOSBOX it runs on anything. You can even copy the files to your mobile phone and play it, or whatever.","June 18, 2015","true","2.0"," 19 of 27 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","19","27","0","3"

When I saw this in the Steam store on sale I said "why not?"  Well, I wish I still had that $6.00 in my pocket.  Where to start... The game is basically unplayable.  I assume there have been no modifications done to this game to make it user friendly since its release, but for the price they could have at least overhauled the controls to make the game manageable.  Nothing here is intuitive and the manual I found online is not much help either. I guess the only people that I can really reccomend this game to are the ones that might have played it on the PC in the early 90's and still have fond memories.  Even then I caution this game is garbage in its current form and could stand to even get some mouse support.  PASS ON THIS TITLE AND GO WITH A DIFFERENT SUB SIMULATOR...ANYTHING IS BETTER THAN THIS.","November 7, 2014","false","0.4"," 56 of 115 people (49%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","49","56","115","4","3"

The retro aesthetic of the early nineties and the soundblaster-era music really hits my nostalgic vibes. But comandeering a submarine in this game involves looking down at pixels in a top down view of a sea map and having a bunch of knobs that you can only interact with by pressing keyboard shortcuts. And to make any sense of those you need to spend an inordinate amount of time memorizing the manual or printing it, nothing is intuitive and in the end it makes even the most boring walking simulator or the most chore-like grindy games that were released recently seem like a streamlined joyride. If you remember how to play this game from having played it before i could maybe understand the appeal but for any newcomers this is mostly a bundle hoarder item and a collectors item only. Others should avoid cluttering their library with this as it has little to no entertainment value and is mostly a museum piece.","October 5, 2015","false","0.2"," 12 of 27 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","12","27","2","3"

Posted to Steam really sucks. Controls (if you can call is that suck) , visual are nothing but dots on a screen where Nintendo Entertainment System puts this to shame. Do not buy this game. I got it cheap on G  2  A  cheap and wish I could return the key for my money back. You can't even use steams normal F12 overlay to show how badly this game sucks. No intro music, game style layout sucks, if I could beat someone in the face for stealing, I would beat that bass ted that uploaded this game to steam. Do ..... Not ....... Purchase .......unless you want to waste your money. I'm really disappointed as I thought I was going to have fun as I did on NES.
